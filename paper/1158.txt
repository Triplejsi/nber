Raids and Imitation

Abstract

A
Many job changes occur without intervening spells of unemployment.
model is constructed in an attempt to understand this phenomenon. It implies
that the best workers are hired away first because, with imperfect informa-

tion, prices do not fully adjust for quality. Thus, there develops stigma
associated with failing to receive outside offers. The force of the stigma,
which affects wages, depends upon the likelihood of discovering a worker's
ability, the size of the market, and the speed of diffusion of information.
In some occupations, it implies that there quickly develop pronounced differ-

ences in the treatment of raided and unraided workers. A consequence is a
theory of occupational wage dispersion. The Peter Principle——that workers are
promoted to a level of incompetence——is a direct implication.

The model can

be applied to product markets as well to explain the relationship between
price and time on the shelf.

Job changes often occur without spells of unemployment. Highly educated
workers, for example, rarely suffer unemployment. A large proportion of their
job switches occur only after the new job is secured. These workers, whose
skills and ability levels are less homogeneous, differ from less skilled,
perhaps more homogeneous workers who are more likely to experience

unemployment in the process of changing jobs. Most research has focused on
job changes that imply spells of unemployment. Indeed, the primary rationale

behind the earliest papers on search theory was to explain unemployment.1 But
if there exists what some refer to as a "dual labor market,"2 these theories

may be most applicable to the secondary workers. This paper attempts to
formulate a theory of turnover and wage dynamics that may better describe the
primary labor force, defined as those who change jobs without unemployment.3
In the process, a number of previously unexamined phenomena are explored.
The first task is to understand the relationship between worker quality

and turnover. Do markets clear more quickly for the most able workers? Why
is it that there is a tendency to try to hire the most able individual, even

though his wage rate is higher? It appears that prices do not adjust fully
for differences in quality. Buyers constantly seek that diamond in the rough.
This also yields the Peter Principle: The best workers are stolen away so
those who remain appear incompetent relative to their peers.
The process that is examined makes "stigma" an important feature of labor

markets. Because of the information that is produced when workers succeed or
fail to receive outside offers, workers who are undesired by outsiders are

—2—

treated very differently from those who enjoy an active outside market. Thus,
stigma, which can be thought of as the consequences of a worker's history of
offers and/or employment, is modeled and treated explicitly.

This results in an understanding of the dynamics of worker turnover and

wage evolution. Sometimes the patterns may be unusual ones. For example,
there may be little action for the first few years of an academic economist's

career. Then one job offer triggers others. There is a flurry of activity,
wages change rapidly and a job change may or may not occur. After this, a
stable period follows, with few offers coming his way again. (Such dynamics
are often said to characterize the market for firms where takeover attempts
are the equivalent of outside offers.)
The patterns of turnover and wage change can be related in a very simple

way to the size of the market, the difficulty associated with learning a

worker's ability, and the speed of diffusion of information. For example,
when information is difficult to acquire, wages have little dispersion within
an occupation, age—earnings profiles are flat, and stigma is unimportant.

Further, there is only a very weak relation between ability and tenure. Other
relation are easily traced.

A number of implications are derived. Among the more interesting are:
(1) The best workers are raided first. Everyone goes after high quality,
highly—priced ones rather than lower quality, lower—priced ones.
(2) wages differ substantially between workers who receive outside offers

and those who do not. This provides implications for wage differentials
across occupations and for intra—occupational wage variation.
(3) A corollary is that the importance of stigma depends upon the proba-

bility that an outsider recognizes the ability of a given firm's workers and

upon the number of buyers. Stigma is not likely to be as pronounced for

—3—

assembly line workers as it is for research academicians. As a result, wages
are less closely related to ability and age—earnings profiles are flatter for
assembly line workers than they are for academicians.

(4) The oldest workers on a given job are the least productive. This
paraphrases the Peter Principle4 and results because the most able of the young
workers are bid away.

(5) Workers maximize their expected wealth by working for the firm that

is most likely to know their true ability levels. This applies even to low
ability workers.

(6) Txrnover may exhibit an inverted U—shaped relation to experience for
any one worker, even though the aggregate relation is exponentially declining
in experience.

Before any implications are derived, it is necessary to construct a

simple model and to outline a few basic relations. That is done in the next
section.

I A MODEL
To focus on competition among firms for workers, we begin with a simple
model that captures the key features of the effects of informational differ-

ences and informed trading. This enables us to examine phenomena such as
raids, offer matching and imitation in the labor market.
Suppose that there are two firms,

j and k. Firm j hires the worker

initially so that given any tie in offers from j and k, the worker remains

at j.5 Firm k initiates a raid by offering wk > w. The worker's product
at firm j is M, a random variable that, for simplicity, is distributed
uniformly between zero and one. It is easy to allow for specific capital but
this is ignored throughout.

—4—

Information takes the following form: With probability P, j learns
the true value of M before raiding occurs and with probability
knows only the ex ante distribution of M at that time.

If

j

(1 -

P)

learns the

truth, then j becomes an "informed" trader. Similarly, with probability k

(not necessarily equal to P) k learns the true value of M before the
raiding offer must be made arid with probability (1 -

k'

k only knows the

ex ante distribution of M.

Public Information;

Raids are selective because the raider is susceptible to "winner's

curse."6 Firm k knows that on average, j lets the worker go when j's
assessment of the worker's output falls below wk This implies that under
many circumstances, any raiding strategy that can succeed results in losses to

the raider. Everything depends upon the nature of market information.7

To see this, suppose that j always knows what k knows, either because

k's strategy is different in all cases so that j can infer what k knows,
or because k's information is public. This is characterized by the information in Table 1:

The proposition that k can never raid successfully follows trivially

from the fact that j has all of k's information, and more.
that is profitable to k is immediately matched by j.

Any strategy

Any unprofitable move

is ignored by j so that k steals the workers only when doing so is
unprofitable.

Winner's curse occurs whenever k is uninformed. The expected product

of the worker is 1/2. But any attempt by k to raid at wk > 0 fails or
results in losses.

If k is uninformed and 3 is uninformed (the bottom right cell of
Table 1), then 3 will match any offer up to E(M) =

1/2.

A raid at any

Wk > 1/2 is ex ante unprofitable. If j is informed and k is not, then 3
matches offers when M > Wk so k gets nothing if M > wk. But 3 declines
to match when wk > M. So k only succeeds in stealing the worker when Wk >
M, and this is a losing strategy. In fact, given that k is uninformed,
k's expected gain is

for Wk < 1/2. (For Wk > 1/2, the expected gain is even less at
+ (1 —

Pi)(wk

-

1/2).)

The expected gain is negative when k is

uninformed so no raid occurs when k is uninformed. Further, by assumption,

when k is informed, so is j. All raids are unsuccessful. The conclusion is
that no raids occur in the absence of private information and firm—specific
capital.

—6—

Successful

Raids:

In order for k to ever attempt a raid on j, at least one of two
assumptions must be relaxed: Either there must be specific capital, so that

the worker is worth more to k than to j, or k's information must be
private. Relaxation of either assumption is sufficient to guarantee that
raids sometimes occur. We focus on informational differences.
It is important to consider not only whether a firm is informed about the

worker's product, M, but also whether it is informed about the rival's state
of knowledge. Both affect the optimal wage strategy. What is essential is
that there be some situations when the current employer does not know that his

rival is informed. There are a number of justifications for this possibility.
First, the worker's claim of an outside offer is not credible. He always has

an incentive to claim this if wages rise as a result. Second, k has no
incentive to convince j

that

the offer is genuine because doing so

frustrates all raid attempts. On the contrary, k should conceal its attack.
Third, the "outside offer" may reflect the worker's value of leisure, which

has no bearing on M.8
For simplicity, assume that an informed firm is also aware of its rivals'
state of knowledge, but that no uninformed firm knows what its rivals know.
This allows all the relevant possibilities and saves on tedious and un-

enlightening discussion. The more general case is described in the appendix.

Under this situation, raids occur only if k is informed. If. k is
uninformed then it is never profitable to raid. This is easily seen: An
uninformed

raider encounters either an

informed,

informed or uninformed firm j. If

j

which happens with probability P, then no profitable raid can

succeed: K only succeeds in stealing those workers for whom M < wk

(otherwise j will match). This results in an expected loss to K of

raids at Wk > w. are successful. Now, in competition,

w is the maximum

wage consistent with zero profits. (This is derived more formally below.)

Therefore, if k is uninformed, there is no possibility that an offer of

> w to a randomly chosen worker can result in profits since K has no

at both firms. But
w does not result in a successful raid. So, k's profit from raiding
uninformed is zero if j is uninformed, but negative if j is informed.

and M is the same

k does not raid when uninformed.

Raids do occur, however, when k is informed. Recall that k's move is

non—informative. Since w is the wage that j offers to a worker about
whom j is uninformed, k raids workers at

about whom it knows that

w +

M > w. If j is also informed and j knows that the outside offer is
genuine, then the raid fails, because j matches the offer. But with

It might seem that an informed j would behave differently with respect
to high—ability workers than with respect to low—ability ones. This is not

correct. The informed j could make w a function of M. But nothing is

—8—

gained for workers with M > w3. No w(M) <M acts as a deterrent to an

informed k. No w(M) > M is profitable if k is informed and no

uninformed k raids. Nothing is gained by conditioning w on M, even
when j has the information to do so.
Further, risk—neutral workers who do not know their abilities will not
sign with any firm that retains the right to reduce wages after observing M.
This would result in an expected wage for unraided workers that is less than

w and

since w to unraided workers guarantees zero profit, a fixed w to

all unraided workers dominates.10
The results of this section can be summarized: In the absence of any
firm—specific capital, raids only occur if raiders have private information

and if the raider is informed. For a raid to be profitable, the raider must
know the realization of a worker's output and not merely the distribution.
Additionally, raids only occur on workers from the upper part- of the

ability distribution. Raiders only make profits on those workers, because the
current firm pays all workers on which it is uninformed some given wage, Wj.
The market has a bias toward underpaying high quality workers.

The Optimal Wage Strategy and Equilibrium:

Now let us derive more formally j's optimal wage strategy and describe

the market equilibrium. If both j and k are informed, then j matches

any offer by k and w = M,

the worker is paid his marginal product. Firm

j earns zero profit on this worker.

If j is uninformed, but k is informed, k raids. But since j
not believe worker claims of outside offers, k succeeds in stealing the

worker at w + C. Again ys profits are zero.

—9—

Firm j retains the worker at wage

w whenever k does not raid.

Firm k does not raid either because k is uninformed, or because k is
informed that M < w,
3

Firm j offers w to unraided workers. The goal is to derive w.
Recall that k only raids when k is informed that M > w so j is not be
left with a representative sample of workers. Even though j may not be able
to verify any one worker's claim of an outside offer (and consequently does
not react to it),

j knows that workers who actually do leave the firm come

from the part of the ability distribution where M exceeds

w. Again, there

are two reasons why a worker remains with firm j: Either the worker has M >

w., but k does not know it, or the worker has M < w1——the worker is an
undiscovered star or an already overpaid performer. The probability that

M > w and k is uninformed is (1 -

wi)(l

—

since M is distributed

uniformly between 0 and 1. The expected value of M if this is true is (1 +

w1)/2.

The probability that M < w is w1 (k's information being

irrelevant here). The expected value of M if this is true is w/2. The
expected value of a worker who is not stolen away, ustng the relevant
conditional probabilities, is

Now, in equilibrium the competitive firm must earn zero profit. Zero
profit is already guaranteed for workers who are raided (successfully or

unsuccessfully). So in equilibrium, w must be set so that zero profits are
earned on those workers who are not raided. Thus, from (2),

Equation (2) simply says that j must set w so that expected profit on
unraided workers is zero, given that only workers with M > w are stolen

away. Any w less than that amount results in positive profits so that
another firm

can

attract all workers.

Every w greater

than that amount

results in negative profit.

Solving equation (3) for w yields two roots, but one is always

negative. The

learns is genuine and if j is

informed that M > w1, i matches the offer and the worker's wage is driven

up to M. (Only workers with M > w. receive outside offers.) If the worker

receives an outside offer and j cannot verify that M > w, j allows the
worker to leave. Zero expected profit is guaranteed.

That w < 1/2 implies that unraided workers are underpaid relative to
the population mean. This is because all firms try to steal undiscovered
workers whose values exceed their wage. The search for pearls leaves mostly
oysters behind so that the output of remaining workers falls short of the
population mean.

Raiders' Profits and Costly Information:

seems that all firms would prefer to be

raiders only. In fact, the more raids attempted, the more profitable the
firm.

The reason for this result is that k is an exogenous "gift" to outsiders in the current setup. A raider is endowed with a specialized factor——

information__Pk of the time and the endowment costs the firm nothing. Firms
endowed with such a gift earn rents on the scarce factor.

More realistic, perhaps, is the situation where potential raiders are

forced to buy information at some cost. Suppose, for example, that only if a

firm bears cost A does it learn a worker's ability with probability k
otherwise it learns the worker's ability with probability zero. (Think of A
as time spent reading a worker's resume, which results in useful information
of

the time.) The expected return on the investment in information is

and

the cost is A. The investment is made so long as A < k fM — w)dM.

But this still leaves the raider with positive profits, which induces entry

into the raiding business. Entry of other raiders reduces the likelihood that
any one informed raider acquires the worker. In fact, equilibrium occurs when

there are N raiders such that

Ex Ante Differences in Information:
This

section considers what happens when firms

have different probabili-

ties of becoming informed. This èan arise because firms learn more about

own workers

than about others or because some firms

others.

What is essential in this model is that there is a difference between ex
ante and ex post

information. Think

of becoming informed about a worker as

occurring when reading one of his articles in the AER. If the potential buyer
only reads one out of 20 papers per month then P =

.05.

While it is likely

that the current employer reads more of his own workers' papers than others'

so that Pj >

it is still possible that an outsider may

one that the

With which firm should the worker

sign? Since the wage at the current firm depends upon getting outside offers,
should the worker sign with the firm with poorest information? Does this
depend upon whether the worker is high or low ability?

These questions are easily answered using eq. (4). If the worker signs

with j, then he gets

The answer is always. It always pays to sign

which implies Pj < k• This results in a contradiction.
The intuition follows: First, that ability level is irrelevant is

obvious. The worker only gets M when both

and k are informed so the

identity of j and k is irrelevant. Second,

j knows that the better

informed is k, the more likely is j to get stuck with the lowest quality

workers. As such, the equilibrium wage that j offers falls with k• Since

—14—

j

experiences less adverse selection, j can (and in equilibrium will) offer

a higher wage to unraided workers. Since a worker who is raided is raided

at w + C (unless

j

is also informed), the worker always benefits from

increases in w. Thus, he always signs with the firm least susceptible to
adverse selection or with the best informed firm, independent of his ability.
The current employer does not pay higher—ability workers higher wages
unless an outsXder forces him to do

Even low quality workers benefit from

working for the most informed employer. That employer is least likely to be
affected by winner's curse and offers the highest equilibrium wage to unraided

workers, a wage that is independent of ability levels. It requires two

informed buyers to drive the worker's price to M, and their identity
relative to the current employer is irrelevant.

Imitation
Most of the interesting phenomena can be analyzed only in a ntultiperiod,

multifirm context. The desire here is to analyze the way that one firm
Imitates another and to trace the evolution of

wages and turnover as it varies

with worker ability level.

Think of there being N +

1

ex ante identical firms, each of which has a

probability P of being informed (for simplicity of notation, assume that P

is identical for all N traders). The worker is at one of the N +

1

firms,

and, as above, call it j. An innovation in this section is that there are
two ways to obtain information about a worker: First, one can discover the
worker's productivity by oneself--discovery-—and this happens with proba-

bility P each round. Second, one can infer the worker's productivity——
inference——by observing the actions of others.'3 Thus, a raid during the
previous round tips off others that the worker's productivity exceeded his

—15—

previous wage. This often leads to an inverted U—shaped path of raids over

the worker's lifetime. Few raids take place initially. Then there is a
flurry

of

activity that dies away rapidly. The shape of the time path of

raids depends in interesting ways upon the average levels of information in

the market, and upon the number of potential buyers. Additionally, the
complete time path of wages for movers and stayers is derived.14
The difference between the two types of information is characterized in
the following way: Information that the firm obtains by itself with probabil-

ity P per round can be used in that round. In order to use inferential
information, it is necessary to wait one round.15 The informed trader gets a

head start and moves immediately. Those who learn the worker's product by
inference, only do so after the informed trader has made his move because it
is that move that tips off others.16
To derive the complete dynamics, it is useful to consider first the time

path of raids on a worker with M > w1 where w1 is defined as the wage that
the current employer pays to unraided workers in round 1. Since, as will be

shown below, wT > w1, those workers remain susceptible to raids
throughout.

In the first round, there is only one way that a raid can occur: One of

the N firms must make a discovery. The probability that this occurs is P
for each of the N firms so the expected number of raiding offers in round 1
is

(7)

R(1)

In round 2, things are more complicated. In round 1, there were three
relevant possibilities: there were no raids, there was exactly one raid, or
there was more than one raid.

—16—

Define p

with probability

there were no raids in round 1

because no outsider was informed. In that case, round 2 is identical to round

1 and there are NP expected raids.
If there was more than one informed firm in round 1, then the equilibrium

was that the worker's wage was driven up to M in competition. Consequently,
no subsequent raids occur.
The most interesting case is when there was exactly one raid in round 1

and when the current firm, j, was also uninformed. This happens with
probability

NPPN

To allow for further generality, allow for a diffusion parameter that may

be less than 1: If one raid occurs in round 1 then N firms are informed via

inference at the beginning of round 2.17 The eN informed firms raid with
certainty, whereas the (1 — O)N

firms can still learn by discovery with

probability P. The expected number of raids on the high quality worker in
round 2 is

Bound 3 is similar, but slightly different. If there were any raids in

round 1, then the wage rate for the worker was driven up to M by the end of
round 2 at the latest. Inference and imitation by others ensures this.8
If there were no raids in either round 1 or 2, then round 3 is just like

round 1 so the expected number of raids is NP. This occurs with probability

Figure 1 simulates some raiding patterns for different values of N

and P.

—18—

When P = 1,

all learning occurs immediately and no raids occur beyond

round 1 (see panel 1). For high values of P, the pattern is exponential
(see panel 4). But for smaller values of P, an inverted U—shaped pattern
results (see panel 3). The reason is that in the first round, the only way
that a raid can occur is through independent discovery. But in round 2, raids
can occur either by discovery or by inference. Further, all subsequent rounds
have a lower expected number of raids because the likelihood of no earlier
discovery falls as the number of previous rounds increases.

Also obvious is that an increase in N makes the number of raids in
later periods drop off more quickly (compare panel 5 to panel 3). This is
like introducing more information into the market.

For very small values of P, raids are unlikely to occur so that hf e—
cycle variation in wages is likely to be smaller——age—earnings profiles are
flatter——in occupations where learning about worker ability is very difficult.
Stated alternatively, age—earnings profiles for "visible" jobs should be
steeper and display more variance across workers than those for less visible

jobs at equivalent skill levels. (Competition implies, however, that the
expected values of the profiles across the two occupations are the same for
similar workers.)

Inverted U—shaped patterns of raids are possible for high quality

workers. The likelihood of the inverted U—shape increases with learning by

inference relative to discovery: 0, the parameter of diffusion has a clearly

positive effect on R(2)M

Also, sufficiently high P

eliminates any possibility of inference because all firms learn through
discovery and react immediately (compare panel 6 to panel 5).

Stigma

The previous discussion relates only to the high—abi)ity workers. But

what of the others in the firm? Related, what can the current firm infer from
the failure of some of its workers to receive outside offers and what is the

appropriate response in the multiperiod setting? Finally, what is the
aggregate pattern of raids and turnover for the entire labor force? These
issues are addressed in this section.

First, it is necessary to determine the wage that the current firm offers
to all (uriraided) workers in round 1. If we allow the spot wage to prevail

during each round, then an equation analogous to (3) must hold. The only
difference is in the conditional probabilities. The probability that a worker

was not raided and that M > w1 is (1 —

w1)(PN),

where w, is the wage

that the current employer pays all unraided workers in round 1. The probabil-

ity that he was not raided and M < w1 is simply w1. So, in equilibrium,

Zero expected profits are earned in round 1.

Similar relationships hold for later rounds. In any round t, workers
who remain with the firm at the end of the round fall into one of of two cate-

gories: The worker may have H < w so that no profitable raid is possible.

This happens with probability w. Alternatively, the worker has M >
but no outside firm has discovered this fact in the t periods. This happens

with probability (1 - wT)PNT. Again, in equilibrium, w must be chosen so
that w. equals the expected output of workers who are unraided through I

the failure of a worker to be raided is

then outsiders are always informed. Given any

choice of WT by the current firm, all workers with M > w1 are stolen away.
This implies that the remaining workers have M < w1. Under these circum-

stances the only w1 that does not result in losses for the current firm is
WI =

0.

Winner's curse operates at full force and the original firm takes

that into account in setting the initial wage. All workers are raided and

—21—

each worker receives a wage equal to his marginal product. As P goes to 1,
the message and stigma associated with the failure to be raided grows
stronger.

A number of implications follow immediately. First, and somewhat
trivially, the relation between observed wage and actual marginal product

becomes tighter, the higher is P. The more information that is had by
outsiders, the more often the current firm is forced to pay a worker his

marginal product. In the two extreme cases, when P = 0,

paid wt = 1/2

all workers were

so the distribution of ability has infinite variance relative

to the distribution of wages. When P = 1,

each worker is paid M so the

distribution of wages replicates the distribution of ability.
Second, the expected value of output for unraided workers is lower in

later rounds than in early ones. Differentiating (16) with respect to T,
one obtains that19

t

t — 3E(M unraided through r rounds)
at —

<

The longer the duration during which the worker fails to receive an offer, the

lower is his expected value. Recall that there are two reasons that a worker

remains unraided: Rivals are uninformed or M < Wt. For any given w, the
proportion of workers who are unraided because of rivals' ignorance falls with

time since rivals are more likely to be informed as time progresses. Thus,
the conditional expectation of unraided workers' output falls over time so

must decline with t.
This leads to an important implication: The quality of raided workers

falls over time. Initially, only the most able workers get outside offers.
Everyone seems to be going after the best workers. Uncertainty over ability,

makes them the bargains in the labor market. As w1 falls with T, i.e., as

—22—

the firm updates its evaluation of the worker's worth, successively lower

ability workers become susceptible to raid. (Recently, firms who made job
offers to Harvard MBAS tied the salary offer inversely to the length of time

before acceptance. One interpretation is that the firms recognized that only
lower quality workers remain in the job market as time progresses and lower
the wage accordingly.)
The claim that the best workers are raided first is a statement that is

made conditional upon observables. It does not imply, for example, that more
highly educated workers are raided first. It implies only that among those

with a given level of education, the best in the group are raided. This also
implies that not conditioning upon anything, the higher ability workers are

raided first across the entire population. The reason is that if ability is

given by y, then the estimate of y based on observable x's must have the
property that x's and the estimated residuals are uncorrelated. Since raids
are based upon residuals (all observed information having already affected the
initial wage offer), there is no correlation between raids and the observed

x's. High residual workers are raided and they are, on average, of higher
ability than the unraided ones.

This result is another manifestation of the Peter Principle. The best
workers are stolen away or promoted out of the job. Those who remain are of
lower average quality so they appear "incompetent" relative to the entire
population of workers doing that job.
The way that stigma operates depends upon the probability of an outside

offer. As already pointed out, if P is close to zero, then the failure to
receive an outside offer carries little informational content so the wages of
assembly line workers are likely to be less variable across workers than those

of research academicians. Since researchers publish their thoughts, P, the

—23—

probability that an outsider learns of a worker's productivity is quite

high. But it is very unlikely that a star assembly line worker at GM is like-

ly to be discovered by Ford. From (8), the expectation of M given no raid
in round 1 is likely to be closer to the unconditional expectation for

assembly line workers than for research economists. This is a step toward a
theory of occupation wage differentials,2° but more toward a theory of wage
dispersion within an occupation.

Another wage differential is of interest. It is useful to examine how
the difference between wages of raided workers and those of unraided workers
varies with the likelihood of discovery, the number of potential employers,

and experience (P, N and 1). To do this, it is necessary to derive the
expected value for M for workers who are raided in round t.
Workers who were raided in round t and not before fall into one of two

categories. Either they were susceptible to raid before period r, but were
undiscovered. This occurs with probability

Raided workers receive their marginal products (at the latest by the following round) so their average wage is also given by the R.H.S. of (17).
It is difficult to characterize analytically the behavior of (17).
However, a series of simulations is informative and illustrates the importance

of stigma that results when one is unwanted by others. Table 2 presents the
results.

-24—

The first panel of table 2 sets P = .001

and N = 3.

This can be

thought of as the extreme asebiy_line_worker_ifl_a_big_threeaut0maker
case. (Actually, the number of firms is 4 = N + 1.)

Note that even after 15

rounds, the conditional expectation and wage of M for unraided workers is
only trivially different from the unconditional expectation of .5. The
failure of an assembly—line worker to be raided by another firm is not
informative because the probability that a high—quality worker will be
discovered by a rival firm is small.

At the other extreme, in the last panel, is the case where P = 1.

Here,

number of firms is irrelevant because each outsider always has perfect if or—

mation. There is no equilibrium wage offer greater than zero that does not

result in losses to the current employer. Thus, w(T) = 0

and the entire

population is raided.21

The research academician might fit somewhere in the middle. If the

number of rival firms equals 10 and P = .2

(panel 6), then by the beginning

of the third round, the expectation of unraided workers' output has fallen to

the lowest 3.4% of the ability distribution. If this characterizes the true
situation, it implies that outside offers are an extremely important signal.
Those who do not receive them are treated very differently from those who

do. E.g., the average wage of workers who are raided in round 1 is .62 as
compared with .034 for those unraided at the end of three rounds. (Of course,
the length of a round, although conceptually well defined, is difficult to

calibrate empirically. A round is that period during which information
remains private. whether that is a month or a year is an open question.)

There is no monotonic relation that is independent of P between date of
turnover and the wage change that occurs with the job switch.

This can be

—25—

It is now possible to put everything together so as to derive turnover

behavior. First, the total number of raids in any period T consists of the
si.n of raids of all groups subject to raid. For example, in round 1, the only

group that can be raided are those whose M > w1. The expected number of
raids on a worker in round 1 is

R(1) = [Prob(M > w1)) [Expected number of raidsiM > w1)
=

(1-w1)NP.

In round 2, two

groups are

subject to raids: those with M > w1

and

those with w2 < M < w1.

Eq. (7) already provides the general formula for R(t)IM>w. It is
tedious to derive a similar formula for the group with

< M <

so it

is derived in the appendix and presented in (18):

Given (1) the total number of expected raids in any period T is the

1. The heaviest weight goes to the group with M > w1. All other

—26—

groups have decreasingly important probability weights in (19). This implies
that the pattern observed for the labor market as a whole will closely

resemble that of figure 1. But again, some simulations are instructive.
First, it is interesting to compare the pattern of raids that workers in

different categories experience. Figure 2 shows the pattern of raids on
workers with
P =

.1,

N =

< M < w_1 as t varies: the values of the parameters are

5,

e = 1.

There are two patterns that stand out. First and most obvious, is that

for higher values of t, that is, for the group, say, with w5 < M < w4 as

opposed to w1 < M <.1 (panel 4 vs. panel 1), the raids start later. For
the group with w5 < M < w4, raids do not begin until the fifth round whereas
they begin in the first round for the group with

w1 < M < 1. Lower-quality

workers tend to be raided later in their careers.

Second, the pattern changes as t increases. There is a tendency to get
more raids in the initial raiding period because information accumulates

before it becomes profitable to make a move. For example, consider an

individual with w10 < M < w9 (panel 5). It takes ten periods before the
wage that unraided workers receive drops low enough to make a raid attempt

successful. But during those ten periods, information accumulates on the
worker so that when the tenth period arrives, many are able to make a move.
Of course, the effect of these spikes is likely to be extremely small in
the aggregate for two reasons: First, the number of workers in any given cell,

w < N < w,_1 is very small (except for t =

1).

Second, most workers are in

situations where P, the probability of being discovered, is also likely to

be low. So for example, in figure 2, panel 7, if P = .00 1, N =

and t = 10,

io,

8

1

the size of the spike is small——only .1 raids occur in period

10. With such a low P, inference is more important than discovery and the

—27—

period during which most raids occur is period 11. But even there less than

one expected raid occurs. When we take into account that only w9 — w10 of
the workers are in this category, the observed effect is trivial.

The entire picture is put together in figure 3. Figure 3 simulates equa-

tion (19) for different values of P, N, and 0. It represents the expected
pattern of raids on a worker of unknown quality over time. As such, it is the

stntt of raids on each group w < M < w_1 as t varies weighted by the
probability that the worker falls into that group. Since the probability that

a worker has M such that w, < M < 1, is largest among groups, the pictures
tend to be dominated by the pattern of raids on workers of that groups.

Different patterns of raids are possible. The inverted U—shape is most

likely when 6 is close to 1 (so that inference is important), when P is
small (so discovery is unlikely), and when N is small (so that discovery is
unlikely). The exponentially declining pattern is most likely to occur when
0 is close to zero (cf. panel 8 to 7, 2 to 1, 4 to 3, and 6 to 5) so that

inference is unimportant, when P is large (cf. panels 3 to 5) so that
discovery is important, and when N is large (cf. panel 3 to 7 to 1) so that
discovery is important.

This provides some simple implications. High turnover occupations are

those most likely to have high values of N and P. Both imply a tendency
toward exponentially declining raiding and turnover with time. In low

turnover occupations with few firms and little visibility (low N, low P),
the pattern of raiding and turnover is likely to be inverted U—shaped. (This

assumes that variations in 0 are small across occupations.)
Stated alternatively, the pattern of raids allows the empiricist to

identify p, 0 and the length of the round. Of course, assumptions about the
shape of the distribution of M are crucial for identification.

—28—

The probability of turnover is similar, but not identical to the

probability of a raid. A raid is successful if and only if the current

employer is uninformed. The probability of turnover in round T on a worker
with Wt < M < wt_i is derived in the appendix and given by

II. Extensions and Further Implications

Wages and

Tenure:

The relation of wages to tenure is not straightforward. Since it is the
best workers who are stolen away most rapidly, those young workers who remain

in their jobs are likely to be of lower quality. So, tenure and wages can be
negatively related. But in a sample of older workers, those who most recently
changed jobs are likely to have been raided later in life. They are the lower
quality workers so that tenure should be positively related to wages among

older workers. which effect dominates in a sample of the entire population is
ambiguous, but one implication is clear: The relation of tenure to wages

becomes more positive with age. I know of no evidence on this point.23

—29—

Stigma and Unemployment:

"Stigma" is often used to refer to workers who suffer spells of unemployment and find that subsequent demand for their services is adversely affected.
Indeed, there is a significant literature that attempts to analyze these
spells and to determine whether they are the result of inherent worker
heterogeneity or of the signalling effect of unemployment.24

This paper focuses primarily on job changes without unemployment. How-

ever, if the current firm, j, is reinterpreted as the state of unemployment
and

is defined as the reservation wage, then the model applies to unem-

ployed workers as well. The interpretation of T is the length (or number)
of spells of unemployment. As the worker is "unraided" out of unemployment

for a longer period of time, wj falls and so does the average wage of raided
workers. Thus, individuals who leave the state of unemployment quickly (are
raided during initial rounds) have the highest expected wages (see table 2).
Those who are unemployed for longer periods have lower expected wages because
they are, on average, lower ability workers and their reservation wages are
lower on average.

Lower values of P and N reduce the bite of stigma. Lower N is
interpreted as fewer potential buyers. Individuals who are unemployed during
a recession should not experience as large a wage depression following a given
spell of unemployment as those who are unemployed during an expansion. This is
illustrated in table 2 by comparing the path of wages for raided workers

(those who eventually become employed in this context) when P =

to that when P = .01, N = 100.

.01,

N = 3

The intuition is clear: When there are few

buyers in the market, little can be inferred from the failure of a particular
worker to be discovered by one.

—30—

Similarly, low values of P imply that unemployment should have small

effects on subsequent wages. Here P can be thought of as the probability
that a given buyer discovers a given worker. The value of P is low when
workers are not making themselves known to potential firms. Consequently, the
effect of being out of work, but in school or even on vacation, should be less
detrimental to future wages than that of being unemployed for the same period

of time while actively searching. Active searchers have higher P's so more
can be inferred about those who do not find jobs. Table 2 illustrates this

point as well. Compare the path of average wages of raided workers when
P = .001, N

3 to that when P =

.2,

N = 3.

Wages fall much more quickly

with unemployment in the latter case.

Shelf Life, Product Quality,
Product Prices, and Clearance Sales:
The same model can be used to analyze the dynamics of product prices as

they relate to shelf life. Consider the problem facing the used—car salesman.
On average, he probably has better information than his customers about the

cars he sells. But on any given car, a buyer may actually know more about

that one car than the seller (P >

k'

but k ).

0).

Those cars that are

purchased most quickly tend to be the ones that are underpriced relative to

their value. The ones that remain on the lot are those that are overpriced
relative to their value.

In the same way that firms infer that their unraided workers are lower
quality than the estimate at the beginning of a round, 80 the car dealer
learns that the cars that remain on the lot are lower quality than estimated.

At the beginning of each day, he sets the price of the car, w(t),

based upon

his evaluation of the observables: w(T) is the price below which he is

willing to keep the car. But w(t) falls with time on the lot. This is what

—31—

clearance sales are about. Goods that remain on the shelf for a long period
of time are reduced in price to reflect the lower quality that consumers
attach to the less desirable color or style, which was not captured by initial

prices.

Additionally, the comparative statics with respect to P, N and e are
appropriate in the product case as well. If P is high so that buyers are
well informed, price falls more rapidly with shelf life. In the wholesale
market where buyers are the retailers and are themselves well informed, prices
on goods that remain on the warehouse shelf should fall quickly with time,

relative to those that remain on the retailer's shelf. Additionally, when

N is low, price remains more invariant to shelf time. For example, the price
of unusual houses for which the number of buyers is few should not fall as
steeply with time on the market as more homogeneous houses.

III. Summary and Conclusions
The focus of this paper is on turnover that occurs without unemployment.
Job turnover and the evolutIon of wages can be related to the size of the
market, the probability that a worker's ability level is discovered, and the

speed with which information travels through the market. The dispersion of
wages, slopes of age—earnings profiles, and the force of stigma are all

affected by these variables. A large number of buyers and easily identifiable
ability imply that stigma operates quickly and that the best workers are
raided first so that workers who do not receive outside offers find themselves
treated very differently from those who do.
The Peter Principle, that workers are promoted to their level of incompe-

tence, is an implication. Since the best workers are stolen or promoted out
of the job early, the older ones who remain and do not move further up the job

—32—

ladder are low ability relative to the population of workers doing that job.
As a consequence of selective raiding, firms are left with lower than

average quality workers. This insures that workers always choose to be
employed by the best informed firm because that firm can offer the highest

wage. This is true, independent of worker ability. Even low ability workers
prefer to work at firms with the best information about worker ability. Thus,
initial employers may appear to screen for the rest of the market.

Although unemployment is not the primary focus, a reinterpretation of the

model provides implications for unemployed workers as well. Specifically,
those who are unemployed during recession and those who do not actively seek
jobs are likely to experience less adverse effects from the unemployment.
Finally, the model can be extended to examine product marketing prac-

tices. In particular, clearance sales and the general relationship between
shelf life and product price can be understood. The prices of wholesale goods
should fall more rapidly with time on the shelf than prices of retail goods.
Similarly, the prices of heterogeneous goods in these markets should be more
rigid with respect to time on the shelf.

yields NP raids in t + 1. The probability that there was exactly one raid

For periods t > t + 2, a raid can only occur if there was no or one raid in

gives rise to NP expected raids in T. If there was exactly one raid in

So equation (18) is derived.

If ¶ > t such that Wt < M < w_1, then the probability of turnover is
zero since no raids occur.

If T =

then a turnover occurs if f the current employer is uninformed

and at least one outsider is informed. This occurs with probability

If t > t + 1, then turnover can occur because no turnover occurred

at least one outsider becomes informed in I and the current

3The most notable model of wage determination is Becker (1975). Others
include Lazear (1979), Lazear and Rosen (1981), and Harris and Holrnstrorn

(198—). The model that most effectively deals with job turnover in the
absence of unemployment is Jovanovic (1979). Although the theory of specific
human capital attempts to integrate wage dynamics with labor turnover, too
much indeterminacy remains to have a very informative set of predictions.
This is rectified somewhat by the work of Kuratani (1973), Hashimoto (1979),
Hashimoto and Yu (1980) and Hall and Lazear (1982).
4See Peter (1969).
5All that this requires is a small moving cost.

6See, for example, Wilson (1977), Milgrom and Weber (1982), and Riley and
Samuelson (1981) for a more complete discussion.

7mis ignores any firm—specific aspects of the problem.
8See Harris and Townsend [1981] for a discussion of incentive
compatibility and invertibility.

9This is a direct result of the discrete nature of information. In a

more continuous setup, it is possible that w(M) with w > 0 might serve a
deterrence role. But this complicates the problem greatly without any obvious
changes in implications.

—39—

0A fixed w is also least susceptible to moral hazard problems where
the firm tries to deceive the worker into believing that M is low. Also, it

best masks j's knowledge from k.

That w >

1 -

is obvious since

<

I

so both 1/(1 —

and

exceed 1. It is also true that w < 1/2. To see this, define

111(1 —
x E

0

1/(1 —

and assume the opposite: Then
—

1)/(x

— 1) >

1/2

or
> l/2x + 1/2

This implies

— 2x + 1

o >

But x2 — 2x + 1

has a mm. at x =

1

0.

where the value of x2 — 2x + 1 =

Thus, a contradiction is obtained, so w < 1/2
ignores the kind of bargaining problem between worker and firm
that t'brtensen (1978) discusses. Rubinstein (1982) solves that problem when
the value of the good is known to both parties, but the essence of the problem

is that even if the worker knows M, and the seller knows that the worker

knows M, there is uncertainty as to whether the firm knows M. Recall that
the firm is only informed

of the time so (1 —

P)

the time only knows

the distribution and w is the optimum under these circumstances. This

means that 1

of the time, a worker who demands w > w will be let go.

For most reasonable values of

(likely to be small), it is optimal for the

worker merely to accept Wj. There are two caveats: First, if the worker
costlessly and immediately can obtain another job that pays

then all

workers with M > w try to bargain. Second, if the demand by the worker
conveys the appropriate information to the firm about M, it may pay to

4
—40—

bargain even if the firm is uninformed (see the discussion by Fudenberg and

Tirole (1983) on the effects of adding a period to a game). Note also that

the higher is M, the more the worker has to gain so the more likely is the

worker to demand w > w.
3See Grossman (1976), Grossman and Stiglitz (1976, 1980), Canton
(1982), and Gould and Verrecchia (1983) for examples of drawing inferences
from observable market variables.

14The same kind of udel can be used to explain "runs." One individual
makes a discovery, and the rest imitate his behavior. Similarly, the ideas
here are closely related to the literature on technological innovation and its
diffusion across firms.

5The length of the round is defined to be that period over which
information remains private.
16The same mechanism is at work in the market for firms, where takeover

attempts tip off other potential buyers of the firm. As such, this framework
can be used to explain takeover bid behavior as well (see Bradley, Desai, and
Kim (1982), and Jarrell (1983)).

17This is similar to technology diffusion as analyzed by Spence (1982).

Griliches (1982) discusses recent work on the issue. Telser (1982), who
analyzes innovation, constructs an alternative model of technical change where
diffusion of information plays a secondary role.

Assume 6 sufficiently large so that the probability that no firm
learns by inference is close to zero.

is the limiting case. If P = 1,

then it is impossible for the

current employer to be uninformed.
22There are a number of papers that examine empirically what happens to

wages when a job change is made. The general finding seems to be that wage
change on a job switch is greater for younger workers and often negative for

older ones. See, for example, Borjas and Rosen (1980), Bartel (1980), Bartel
and Bor-ias (1981).

23A complication is that tenure is also related to unemployment, with

which the model only deals as an afterthought. For example, workers who
suffer frequent spells of unemployment may have the lowest levels of tenure
among all workers and they are likely to be the least able group.
24See, for example, Ellwood (1982); also Clark and Summers (1982) and

Flinn and Hecknian (1983).
