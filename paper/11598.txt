ABSTRACT

The 2004 Global Labor Survey (GLS) is an Internet-based survey that seeks to measure de facto
labor practices in countries around the world, covering issues such as freedom of association, the
regulation of work contracts, employee benefits and the prevalence of collective bargaining. To find
out about de facto practices, the GLS invited labor practitioners, ranging from union officials and
activists to professors of labor law and industrial relations, to report on conditions in their country.
Over 1,500 persons responded, which allowed us to create indices of practices in ten broad areas for
33 countries. The GLS' focus on de facto labor practices contrasts with recent studies of de jure labor
regulations (Botero et al., 2004) and with more limited efforts to measure labor practices as part of
surveys of economic freedom (Fraser Institute) and competitiveness (World Economic Forum).
Although our pool of respondents differs greatly from the conservative foundations and business
leaders who contribute respectively to the Fraser Institute and World Economic Forum reports, the
GLS and the labor market components of the economic freedom and competitiveness measures give
similar pictures of labor practices across countries. This similarity across respondents with different
economic interests and ideological perspectives suggests that they are all reporting on labor market
realities in a relatively unbiased way. As a broad summary statement, the GLS shows that practices
favorable to workers are more prevalent in countries with high levels of income per capita; are
associated with less income inequality; are unrelated to aggregate growth rates; but are modestly
positively associated with unemployment.

INTRODUCTION
This paper reports on an Internet-based survey designed to collect information on the

state of workplace practices from labor experts and practitioners around the world -- the 2004
Global Labor Survey (GLS). This effort comes at a time of intense debate over the impact of
labor market institutions on economic outcomes, in which analysts use diverse indices of
practices and/or measures of de jure labor regulations to examine the link between the labor
market and general economic success. On one side of the debate are economists and policymakers who attribute some of the economic problems in advanced countries and failures of
developing countries to labor market rigidities that result from government regulations or union
activities. On the other side are economists and policy-makers who argue that the redistributive
and other benefits from regulations and unionism exceed whatever costs they create in the form
of less flexible markets, and that absent institutions, labor markets do not function as perfect
invisible hand mechanisms.
For the advanced countries, the OECD Jobs Study (1994) argued that substantial labor
market reforms were required to cure the European Union’s economic problems. This view
found support in some empirical studies, but also led to further work that stressed the frailty of
many cross-country empirical studies (see Freeman, 2005, for a review of this debate). For
developing countries, there has been a similar debate. Economists at the World Bank and IMF
have worried that labor regulations impede the success of economic reforms (Forteza and Rama,
2002), and often call for greater labor market flexibility to ease adjustment problems; on the
other hand, those associated with the ILO take the opposite perspective.1 Evidence that Indian
states with more pro-labor regulations have performed less well in output and employment in the

institutions, such as unions and collective bargaining, fit within the larger fabric of social dialogue in an economy.

formal manufacturing sector than other Indian states without improving the well-being of
workers raises questions about the value of such regulations within developing countries (Besley
and Burgess, 2004). But evidence from other studies has moved the World Bank, the InterAmerican Development Bank, and the Asian Development Bank, among others, toward nuanced
views about the contribution of labor institutions in development (World Bank, 1995; InterAmerican Development Bank, 2005).
By developing new and potentially more accurate measures of labor practices, the GLS
should improve the quality of analysis, and help economists and others reach firmer conclusions
about the positive or negative effects of given practices on aggregate economic performance.
Overview
The GLS assesses the current state of workplace practices and institutions by surveying
practitioners and labor relations experts who have firsthand knowledge and experience of de
facto practices, as opposed to de jure laws or regulations. The GLS was run as an Internet survey
in 2004 under the auspices of the Labor and Worklife Program (LWP) at the Harvard Law
School. The survey covered many aspects of labor institutions, including employment
regulations, the freedom of association, and employee benefits. The question format used a
seven-point scale that has worked well in surveys of business leaders in the World Economic
Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report (GCR). We invited members of the International
Industrial Relations Organization (IIRO), and subscribers and users of www.labourstart.org, the
news portal dedicated to labor and union affairs, to the GLS website to answer the survey. In
addition, we contacted persons connected with the LWP and the Harvard Trade Union Program
to boost responses in countries where we otherwise had trouble getting sufficient respondents.

4

These efforts produced nearly 1,600 completed surveys from 77 states/territories.
However, a disproportionate number of responses came from advanced English-speaking
countries and only a few came from developing countries. If respondents from the same country
had given widely different answers, the small numbers would have created problems for the
GLS, but statistical analyses shows that the responses to questions were relatively similar within
countries, while varying greatly across countries. Thus, only a few respondents per country are
needed to give a consistent picture of labor practices. In this report, we focus on a subset of 33
countries in which we had at least 4 responses. We amalgamated questions to construct
indicators of conditions in the 33 countries under seven headings: General Economic Situation;
Role of World Bank & IMF; Labor Market Conditions; Freedom of Association & Collective
Bargaining; Labor Disputes; Employment Regulations & Working Conditions; and Employee
Benefits. In addition, we report the respondents’ estimates of the percentage of workers in the
informal sector, the percentage of workers in unions, and the percentage covered by a collective
bargaining agreement.
Over 60% of the respondents to the GLS were union officials or labor activists, most
holding pro-labor positions on issues. This raises questions about potential bias in answers about
labor market practices. To examine whether the orientation of respondents affected their reports,
we analyzed the relationship between respondents’ views on some political and economic issues
and their responses to the GLS questions. We found only a modest relation, implying that any
such effect was small. Still, we calibrated answers to adjust for the attitudes of respondents.
Finally, we compared the calibrated country indices from the GLS with other measures from
surveys whose respondents were likely to have a pro-business or conservative bias: the World
Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report (GCR), which surveys business executives in

5

their country of operation, and the Fraser Institute’s Economic Freedom of the World (EFW)
study. The respondents on the GLS and those on these surveys gave similar pictures of labor
practices. This reflects well on the validity of all of the studies, suggesting that they tap a
common component of information on labor market conditions rather than hinge on the right-left
or labor-management views of respondents. The only difference we detected among the surveys
was the opposite of what we anticipated: GLS respondents had a modestly more positive view of
the labor friendliness of practices than business executives.
We also compared the GLS indicators with the de jure measures of labor market
regulation compiled by Botero et al. (2004), and subsequently updated by the World Bank’s
Doing Business database. The correlation between the GLS and the Botero et al. (2004) data is
lower than that between the GLS and the EFW and GCR indicators, presumably reflecting the
divergence between regulations and implementation.
Finally, we examined how the GLS measures of labor practices varied with the economic
performance of these countries. We found that countries whose practices are more favorable to
workers had relatively higher levels of income per capita and lower Gini coefficients. In
addition, pro-labor practices were unrelated to aggregate growth rates, but were modestly
associated with higher rates of unemployment. These patterns fit reasonably well with the bulk
of studies that relate economic outcomes to measures of labor market institutions.
In sum, the inaugural GLS demonstrates that it is possible to gather detailed, valid
information on labor practices from labor experts and practitioners in different countries at low
cost through the Internet. The major weakness of the 2004 survey was the shortfall of responses
from many developing countries. This can be attributed to the fact that our e-mail contact lists
included fewer practitioners from developing countries, and to weak Internet connections in

6

some countries that made it difficult for persons to respond. This suggests the need for expanding
the reach of the GLS, possibly by supplementing the sample through non-Internet-based
surveying with the assistance of country-based organizations, who could invite practitioners and
experts to fill out the surveys as part of a conference or at some venue with broadband or other
fast links. In addition, we would have liked more responses from personnel and labor relations
practitioners in the business community. Despite these shortcomings, the diagnostics and the
crosschecks with other data sources showed that the GLS did indeed capture useful systematic
information for the purposes of cross-country comparisons of labor market institutions.
Since measures of actual conditions and practices are necessary to monitor the progress
of countries towards meeting difficult-to-measure human development objectives, such as
abolishing child labor, improving safety standards in the workplace (for example, Bohning,
2003), and raising labor standards more broadly, the GLS’s “ask the practitioners and experts”
design offers a distinct way to improve monitoring at the country level.2 The design also offers a
way to obtain objective measures of labor practices in place of subjective categorizations that
could help resolve open issues in the on-going debate about labor institutions.

2.

SURVEY METHODOLOGY
The GLS begins by asking respondents their country of expertise, years of involvement

with labor affairs in this country, and occupation (options included academic, government
official, union activist, among others).3 The survey then moves to six modules of questions
about economic and labor issues, as summarized in Table 1: General Economic Situation; The

2

Such assessments of the protection of workers’ rights and dignity can have operational consequences. For example,
the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) commissioned Verité (2003) to draft a report on
labor conditions around the world, on which it reportedly based some of its emerging market investment decisions.
3
In addition, 205 respondents identified themselves as Labourstart correspondents on Question 0.04 of the survey.

7

Labor Market; Freedom of Association & Collective Bargaining; Labor Disputes; Employment
Regulations & Working Conditions; and Employee Benefits. Several of the question categories
and some questions were adapted from the GCR or from Botero et al. (2004) to facilitate
comparisons. The last module asks respondents about their political and policy leanings: whether
they identify themselves as more left-wing or right-wing; their views on government
involvement in economic policy; whether the state or workers should bear most of the
responsibility for ensuring a basic standard of living; and whether international trade agreements
should contain labor clauses. These questions allow us to identify the orientation of respondents
and examine whether that affected their answers. (The GLS questions are reproduced in their
entirety in Appendix Table 1.)
The survey instrument uses the question design that has worked successfully in the GCR
survey of business executives. Respondents are asked to register their assessments on a scale
from 1 to 7, with the following being a sample question:

We designed the GLS questions so that the left side answer (a response of 1) could be broadly
identified with a pro-business set of institutions or workplace conditions, while the right side

8

answer (a response of 7) corresponded to pro-labor conditions. This question format helped to
minimize the time to complete the survey.4 In addition, three questions asked for quantitative
estimates, for example, on the percentage of workers in the informal sector. The survey
instructions encouraged respondents to skip questions that they were not in a position to answer.
The default answer for all questions was set at “N/A” (for no response).
Survey Implementation
The GLS was hosted at: http://gls.law.harvard.edu, with the assistance of the Berkman
Center for Internet and Society at the Harvard Law School. The survey was launched in February
2004 with an announcement on http://www.labourstart.org, an online news service on trade
unionism around the world.5 We also sent e-mail invitations to take the survey to members of the
International Industrial Relations Organization (IIRO) and the European Industrial Relations
Observatory (EIRO).6 Subsequently, we contacted labor activists and academics in specific
countries through the Harvard Law School Labor and Worklife Program. At its launch, the GLS
was available in three languages, English, French and Spanish; a Portuguese version was added
in November 2004.

SUMMARY STATISTICS, DIAGNOSTICS AND CALIBRATION
The GLS received 1,582 responses by late November 2004, with respondents from 77

states/territories around the world. Table 2 lists these countries and the number of responses from
each. The vast majority of responses were from English-speaking OCED countries (Australia,
4

For the sample of 33 countries with more than 4 responses, the mean time to complete the survey was
approximately 20 minutes, while the median time was just over 14 minutes. This appears to be a reasonable amount
of time to complete the 82 questions in the survey conscientiously, an important consideration especially for
developing countries where Internet access might be relatively expensive.
5
Labourstart has over 15,000 subscribers and over 230 volunteer correspondents.

The ILO provided us with the relevant e-mail information for the IIRO, while the contact information for the EIRO
was obtained from: http://www.eiro.eurofound.eu.int/contact.html.

Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States), but there were also responses from
developing countries such as China (7), India (15), Mexico (7), Peru (14), and South Africa (10).
As noted, the bulk of our analysis concentrates on the 33 states that had 4 or more responses, as
listed at the bottom of Table 2. These 33 states made up 1,514 of the 1,582 responses received.
Table 3 shows that the typical respondent (for the full sample of 1,582 responses) was a
labor activist or union official with substantial experience in labor affairs.7 Almost two-thirds of
respondents reported that they had more than 10 years of experience monitoring or participating
in labor issues in their country; and an additional 15.6% said that they had between 5-10 years of
experience (Table 3A). In addition, Table 3B shows that labor union officials and activists made
up just over three-fifths (60.8%) of the respondents, followed by academics (18.3%) and
government officials (4.4%). Consistent with this background, most respondents gave pro-labor
and left-oriented assessments on questions about their personal views on economic and political
issues (Table 3C). On a 1 to 7 scale, where 1 was the most conservative and 7 the most left-wing
orientation, scores averaged 5.2 to 6.4, across Questions 7.01 to 7.04.
Statistical Diagnostics
For the GLS to provide useful information about differences in labor practices across
countries, responses to survey questions must vary significantly across countries while showing
consistency within countries. As a first test of whether GLS respondents agreed about their
country’s conditions, we calculated the rWG statistic for inter-rater reliability based on James,
Demaree and Wolf (1984). This statistic measures the extent of agreement in the answers among
respondents from the same country compared to a specified null hypothesis. We calculated this

The percentages in Table 3 are similar when the sample is restricted to the 33 countries with at least 4 responses.

10

statistic for clusters of questions in our labor market indices separately for each country.
Specifically, for a given module of J questions, the rWG statistic was calculated as:
rWG

J [ 1 - (sx2 / σ N2)]
---------------------------------------J [ 1 - (sx2 / σ N2)] + (sx2 / σ N2)

where sx2 denotes the mean variance of observed responses across the J questions in the module,
and σN2 is the variance of the null distribution against which we are comparing the observed
distribution of responses. For the null, we adopt a discrete uniform distribution, so that σN2 is the
variance we would observe if the respondents had picked their answers randomly by giving each
possible response equal probability.8
The test statistics reported in Table 4A show a high degree of agreement among
respondents for most countries. The rWG statistic fell below the critical value of 0.7 for only the
handful of countries listed in the rightmost column of the table. The values were lower for
Module 7, which asked for personal views on issues rather than factual matters.9
Did the GLS respondents agree more or less on labor practices in their country compared
to respondents on the widely used Global Competitiveness Report (GCR), which uses the same
1-to-7 scoring system? To answer this question, we calculated rWG statistics using data on
individual respondents from the 2002 GCR.10 The rWG values ranged from 0.81 to 0.96 for the
GCR “Human Resources” modules, which had nine questions on labor-related issues -reassuringly in the same ballpark as most of our rWG statistics for the GLS. The high GLS rWG
For the questions on the seven-point scale, this means picking each response with probability 1/7, which gives σN2
= 4. For the three questions that seek percentage estimates, this means picking each of the 5 options (0-20%, 2140%,…, 81-100%) with probably 1/5 each; in this case, σN2 = 2. For these quantitative questions, we set J = 1 in the
expression for the rWG statistic.
9
It should be acknowledged, however, that the agreement statistics were much poorer for the GLS questions that
sought quantitative estimates, namely questions 2.10, 3.01 and 3.08. This suggests that it is not easy to get a good
consensus gauge of these percentages even from labor market insiders.
10
Andrew Warner made the raw data for the 2002 GCR available to us. There were 97 countries in the GCR sample,
where the response count ranged from 10 (Israel) to 250 (Russia).
8

11

statistics and their similarity to the GCR rWG statistics give us confidence that the GLS accurately
identified country workplace practices and institutions.11
As a second test diagnostic, we computed the Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC):
ICC

σB2

MSB - MSW
--------------- = ------------------------σB2 + σW2
MSB + (k-1)MSW

where σW2 is the within-country variance and σB2 is the between-country variance in responses to
questions. The ICC thus measures the share of total variability accounted for by the betweencountry component. Thus, the higher the ICC, the more the variation in individual responses
reflects differences in assessments across countries rather than disagreements among individuals
within country. As the equation shows, the ICC can be re-written in terms of MSB and MSW, the
between-country and within-country mean sum of squares from a standard ANOVA table, and k,
which depends on the mean number of respondents per country (Shrout and Fleiss 1979).12
Based on the ICC, we also computed the following Spearman-Brown (SB) prediction formula:
SB

k*ICC
--------------------1 + (k-1)*ICC

which measures the estimated reliability of the country-averaged scores.13
We calculated the ICC and SB statistics for each individual question. Table 4B gives
summary values of these statistics for each part of the GLS. The ICC values for the first six
modules of the survey ranged between 0.06 and 0.57, with the corresponding SB reliability
statistic ranging between 0.69 and 0.98. By way of comparison, the ICC values for the 2002
GCR questions on “Human Resources” were between 0.22 and 0.52, with the SB reliability
11

In computing the rWG, we excluded responses that were only partially filled in. We also checked the data to ensure
that no consecutive sets of survey responses were carbon copies of one another.

Here k = (N - Σ i ni2/ N) / (m-1), where N is the total number of individual observations, ni is the number of
observations from country i, and m is the total number of countries in the sample.

statistic ranging between 0.94 and 0.98. This contrast shows greater dispersion in the withincountry reliability in the GLS than in the GCR, due in large part to the smaller sample and more
unbalanced observation counts across countries in the GLS. Still, about one half of the GLS
questions yielded ICC values comparable to those from the 2002 GCR (falling between 0.22 and
0.52). Not surprisingly, the ICC and SB statistics of relative variability are low for Module 7 of
the GLS, which asked for personal views rather than facts about labor conditions.
Calibration for Modal Respondent
As noted, the sample of respondents to the GLS consists disproportionately of union
officials and activists, and of persons with a left orientation. If respondents with particular
attributes gave strikingly different answers to questions for the same country, the particularities
of respondents could be biasing the patterns among countries. To control for this possibility, we
ran a multivariate regression linking responses on the GLS to the characteristics and attitudes of
respondents for the 33 countries with at least 4 respondents:
yci (Q) = Dcountryc + Doccupation + Dexperience + Dlabourstart + …

... + β1 × q701 + β2 × q702 + β3 × q703 + β4 × q704 + υc + εci
Here, yci (Q) is the response given by respondent i from country c for question Q; the D variables
are dummy variables for countries, Dcountryc; occupation, Doccupation;14 years of experience
with labor affairs, Dexperience;15 and whether the respondent is a Labourstart correspondent,
Dlabourstart.16 The measures of left-right orientation are responses on q701 through q704,
which asked for individual’s personal positions on political and economic issues. The regressions
were estimated to allow for standard errors clustered by country (υc).
14

The dummies are for the eight occupational categories listed in Question 0.03, plus an additional category for no
response. All responses “Other” were lumped as one category.
15
The dummies are for: Less than 1 year of experience; 1 to 5 years of experience; 5-10 years of experience; more
than 10 years of experience; plus a category for “NA” (no response).
16
This included an additional dummy for the category “NA” (no response).

13

To correct for differences in respondents’ attitudes, we used the above regressions to
estimate for each question the response that would have been given by a hypothetical modal
respondent with neutral political and economic views. The modal profile corresponded to that of
a “Labor union official” with “More than 10 years” of experience, who was not a Labourstart
correspondent. Neutral views corresponded to those of someone who gave the midpoint answer
(4 on the seven-point scale) for each of the Module 7 questions. These calculations gave us
estimated scores (as well as standard errors) for each question, which we then averaged by
module to obtain country aggregates. In this manner, we constructed 10 summary indices of
labor conditions. Table 5 gives these indices by country, sorted in descending order of score.17
We mark the indices for which the rWG statistic was smaller than the critical value of 0.7 in Table
4A by an asterisk to indicate that the score was based on a low level of inter-rater agreement.
How did these calibrated indices compare with a simpler uncalibrated within-country
mean of respondent scores? Looking across the 75 questions in Modules 1-6 of the GLS, the
minimum cross-country correlation between the calibrated and uncalibrated scores was 0.840,
while the mean correlation was a very high 0.963. This high correlation implies that the ordering
of country scores is largely preserved under different ways of aggregating the raw survey data.18
The rest of this paper uses the indices calibrated to account for respondent characteristics.
Effect of Respondent Orientation
We assess in Table 6 how much the political orientation and attitudes of individual
respondents affected the overall assessments of labor practices. This table reports the results

17

Values for each individual question are available upon request.
The country rankings for all the labor market indicators were virtually identical if the calibration regressions were
run by weighting observation yci (Q) by the number of responses from country c. For the 75 questions in Modules 16 of the GLS, the minimum cross-country correlation between the scores calibrated with weights and that calibrated
without weights was 0.993, while the mean correlation was 0.998. Tables based on the weighted calibration
procedure or on the uncalibrated procedure are available upon request.

from regressions of our calibrated indices on various measures of individual respondent
characteristics, including the questions on political attitudes. The regression coefficients on the
Module 7 variables show little relation to how the respondents reported conditions: Only 3 of
these 28 regression coefficients are significant at a 10% level, while the vast majority of the
occupational coefficients are also statistically insignificant. In short, the impact of personal
biases on the labor market indicators is modest at best, providing further reassurance of the
reasonably high level of objectivity in the assessments contained in the GLS. It is because
responses are only modestly affected by attitudes that the calibrated indices and the un-calibrated
indices are so highly correlated.

THE GLS LABOR MARKET INDICES
The GLS indices in Table 5 capture several familiar patterns of cross-country differences

in labor conditions, for instance between the United States and advanced Europe.
General Economic Situation: This index averaged the responses for questions 1.01-1.09
(Module 1a) regarding the level of the economy and the level of disparities in living standards
within a country. The scores from developed countries were higher than those reported from
developing countries, implying better economic performance and lower inequality. Still, the
United States had a score of 3.762 that placed it in the lower half of countries, reflecting its high
level of inequality among advanced countries. By contrast, Japan ranked 9th despite the
prolonged recession that it experienced, which reflects the fact that the provision of public
services such as education and healthcare remain widely accessible.
Role of World Bank and IMF: This measure took the mean response for questions 1.101.12 (Module 1b) about the extent of World Bank and IMF influence on domestic economic

15

policy. Overall, the low scores indicate that respondents assessed the World Bank and the IMF to
have favored the interests of business over that of workers. Several countries that received IMF
rescue packages during recent financial crises, in particular Brazil, Mexico and South Korea,
reported relatively high scores, consistent with the perception that these international
organizations wield a large influence on domestic policies.
Labor Market Conditions: This index was the mean response for all the Module 2
questions, except question 2.10. The issues captured included how wages are set, the frequency
of wage arrears, and the incidence of child labor and gender discrimination (both key targets of
the ILO’s fundamental conventions). Table 5 indicates that developed countries scored high on
this index, with the United States being the major exception. Developing countries, including
India and China, ranked among the bottom 10 countries.
Freedom of Association & Collective Bargaining: This indicator averaged the responses
from Module 3, excluding questions 3.01 and 3.08. Developing countries ranked low on labor
union strength, while the Western European countries had much higher rankings. The United
States and the United Kingdom had the lowest scores from the developed countries, ranking 20th
and 22nd respectively.
Labor Disputes: This index averaged responses for Module 4 of the GLS. According to
the index, the frequency of labor unrest and employer-employee conflict was lowest in countries
such as Turkey, Singapore, and the United States. In contrast, France, Belgium and Italy had the
highest scores, reflecting the strength of labor movements in these Western Europe countries.
Employment Regulations & Working Conditions: This index gave the average of
responses to Module 5, which deals with the extent of regulation of the labor market, such as the
ease of hiring and firing. Low scores indicate a higher propensity towards employer discretion,

16

whereas higher scores indicate a greater use of labor regulations or collective bargaining
agreements to determine the terms of work contracts. The United States ranked 2nd lowest among
all countries, with a score virtually indistinguishable from China; this is indicative of the large
scope and bargaining power of employers in the negotiation of contract terms with workers. The
United Kingdom placed 10th from the bottom. Labor regulation and collective bargaining were
most influential in Western Europe, particularly in Scandinavian countries.
Employee Benefits: This index was the mean of responses in Module 6, covering pension
schemes, sickness benefits and unemployment insurance. The trends and ranking mirrored
closely those in the “Employment Regulations & Working Conditions” index: Relatively low
levels of benefits in developing countries, and higher levels in developed countries. Once again,
the United States and the United Kingdom had significantly lower benefit levels compared to the
rest of the developed world.
Quantitative Estimates
The GLS asked respondents to estimate the percentage of workers in the informal sector;
the percentage who are labor union members; and the percentage covered by a collective
bargaining agreement. These were coded on a 1-to-5 scale, with 1 representing 0-20% and 5
representing 80-100%. There was greater variability in the responses to these questions than in
many other questions, but even so, the estimates from the GLS were highly correlated with the
percentage unionized, as well as the percentage employment in the unofficial economy reported
in Botero et al. (2004), as illustrated in Figure 1.
% of workers in informal sector (Question 2.10): Developed countries yielded low
estimates for this index, ranging between a response of 1 and 2. The informal sector was large in
developing countries, where the Philippines, Peru and India had scores near 4.

17

% of workers who are labor union members (Question 3.01): Unionization rates were
higher among the developed countries, with Denmark and Sweden approaching a score of 5.
Several developing countries reported moderate levels of unionization, including Brazil, Mexico,
Sri Lanka and India. The GLS accurately captured the low rates of union membership in France
and the United States.
% of labor force covered by a collective bargaining agreement (Question 3.08): The
trends in collective bargaining coverage mirrored closely that of the labor union membership
estimates. The main exceptions were several European countries, such as France, Italy and the
Netherlands, where such agreements extend collective bargaining to workers broadly in the
economy, so that the coverage rates exceed union membership rates.
Do Workplace Institutions Form Systems?
To see whether workplace institutions and practices come together as a bundle, we
calculated a correlation matrix for all of the summary indices (Table 7). The correlation matrix
suggests that workplace institutions broadly fit together into labor relations systems that can be
classified as more or less favorable to workers. For example, looking at the third row, economies
with more pro-worker “Labor Market Conditions” in terms of wage-setting institutions also tend
to have greater “Freedom of Association & Collective Bargaining” and higher levels of
“Employee Benefits”. They also have a low “% informal sector”, as well as high unionization
and collective bargaining coverage rates.
The rightmost column in the table on “Personal Views & Positions” shows how the mean
across responses to the Module 7 questions are correlated with the other measures. Consistent
with the regression coefficients in Table 6, this indicator is only weakly correlated with the labor

18

market indices. There is some evidence suggesting that countries where respondents were more
leftwing tended to give lower marks in assessing the impact of the IMF & World Bank.
In sum, the indices show that developed countries have a more pro-worker orientation,
with more regulation of markets and greater union activity. The exceptions to this pattern are the
United States, and to a lesser extent the United Kingdom, where labor unions are systematically
weaker and labor markets are subject to less regulation than in the rest of the OECD.

5.

COMPARISON WITH OTHER MEASURES
To see how the cross-country variation in labor market institutions and regulations in the

GLS compares to the picture from other sources, we have gathered measures of labor conditions
from: the Global Competitiveness Report survey of business executives; the Botero et al. (2004)
measures on formal labor regulations; and the Fraser Institute’s Economic Freedom around the
World index. We proceed to discuss the correlation between these and the GLS measures.
Global Competitiveness Report (GCR)
The World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report offers the best comparison
with the GLS, since we adopted the same seven-point scale and question format from the GCR,
while adapting some questions for the GLS to facilitate direct comparisons. The GCR asks
managers about economic conditions in their country of operation, which should produce
responses favorable to employer interests, in contrast to the pro-labor orientation of the GLS
sample. Agreement between the two surveys on factual issues would thus go a long way towards
validating both surveys.

19

For our analysis, we matched 14 GLS questions with their counterparts in the 2004 GCR,
as listed in Appendix Table 2.19 The correlation between the GCR and GLS country scores for
these questions was statistically significant at the 1% level for all but two pairs, and even on
those questions, there was a high correlation with closely related questions.20 The correlation
coefficient ranged from a low of 0.44 to a high of 0.93 for the 12 significantly correlated pairs.
Similar results were obtained when we matched the GLS to the 2002 GCR.21 Excluding
the questions pertaining to the World Bank and IMF, there were 11 question pairs, all of which
were significantly correlated at least at the 5% level. For the questions assessing the role of the
World Bank and IMF, the correlation with the corresponding GLS questions was generally
insignificant, except for one match: Greater World Bank and IMF influence on the domestic
economy (GLS Question 1.10) was associated with lower ratings on the IMF’s effectiveness in
promoting high levels of employment and real income (2002 GCR Question 12.02B). On the
whole, there is greater divergence between the business community and labor practitioners in
their assessments on the impact of the World Bank and IMF than in their assessments of
workplace practices.

The Regulation of Labor: Botero et al. (2004) and the Doing Business Database
We also compared the GLS measures with data on the regulation of labor from Botero et
al. (2004), which is based on de jure government regulations and legal provisions, benchmarked

19

The GCR scores for each question are based on a simple mean of the responses for a country. The GCR has a
reverse coding of answering options, so that 7 is the most “pro-business” response and 1 the most “pro-labor”. For
consistency with the GLS, we transformed the GCR data by taking 8 minus the GCR scores.
20
The insignificant correlations were for: GLS question 5.01 on the determination of contract terms for hiring fulltime workers and GCR question 7.02 on the hiring and firing of workers; and GLS question 2.14 on gender
discrimination and GCR question 7.17 on how wages for women compare to that for men for similar work. But
GCR question 7.02 displays a highly significant correlation with GLS question 5.10 on the ease of firing, while
GCR question 7.16 on employment opportunities for women was significantly correlated with GLS question 2.14.
21
The number of countries in the sample drops to 32 with the 2002 GCR, which does not include Cyprus.

20

to 1997. The regulation data was aggregated into indices on: Employment laws, Collective
relations laws, and Social security laws, with higher values indicating a greater extent of labor
regulation.22 Again, we have natural comparisons because we designed the GLS to cover many
of the same labor institutions.23
The top part of Table 8 records the correlation between the ten GLS indices and the
Botero et al. (2004) labor regulation measures. The Employment laws index and the Social
security laws index are significantly correlated with the GLS indices on workplace conditions
from Modules 2-6 (“Labor Market Conditions” through “Employee Benefits”). In addition, the
Social security laws index was highly correlated with the “General Economic Situation” index
and negatively correlated with the “% informal sector” variable. As for the Collective relations
laws index, this had a significant correlation with the “Labor Disputes” module which covers the
same set of issues, but was in general uncorrelated with most of the other GLS variables.
Although the GLS indices were consistent with the rankings by Botero et al. (2004), the
correlations between the GLS and Botero et al. are much smaller than the correlations between
the GLS and the GCR. We attribute part of this to the fact that Botero et al. measure de jure labor
regulations, which will inevitably diverge from de facto workplace practices.24 In addition, there

22

Each index comes from component indices, most coded on a 0-1 scale. For example, one of the sub-indices under
the Collective relations index concerns the “Right to Unionization”. This was coded 1 if the right to form a labor
union was in the constitution, and coded 0 if the constitution did not refer to unions. Values of 0.33 or 0.67 were
assigned for intermediate cases (for example, the constitution mentions unions, but not the right to form one.)
23
Module 4 of the GLS on “Labor Disputes” parallels the Collective relations index, Module 5 on “Employment
Regulations & Working Conditions” parallels the component indices of their Employment laws index; Module 6 on
“Employee Benefits” mirrors their Social security laws index.
24
This de jure-de facto distinction is illustrated by the range of correlations found between some indices from
Botero et al. and questions in the GLS. For example, the correlation between the “Right to Unionization” variable
from Botero et al. and GLS question 3.03 on the protection of the right to form a union was a mere 0.02. By
contrast, the Botero et al. dummy variable for whether the social security system protected against the risk of
unemployment had a correlation of 0.77 with GLS question 6.06 on the extent to which unemployment benefits
were determined by regulations or collective bargaining as opposed to by employers.

21

are differences in the component questions that underlie the two measures.25 Table 8 also gives
the correlations between the GLS and Botero et al. estimates of “% informal sector” and “%
labor union” that are graphed in Figure 1. The insignificant correlation between the “% collective
bargaining” index and the “Right to Collective Bargaining” dummy variable from Botero et al.
likely stems once again from the distinction between the de jure constitutional right and the
actual de facto extension of collective bargaining agreements.
The World Bank’s Doing Business database, set up to update measures of formal
regulation per Botero et al. (2004), offers a further comparison between de jure and de facto
labor practices. The most recent edition of the Doing Business database contains a Rigidity of
Employment Index benchmarked to January 2004, based on laws relating to the hiring and firing
workers, and the rigidity of work hours. The row labeled “Doing Business” in Table 8 shows that
this index was uncorrelated with any GLS measures of workplace conditions, including the GLS
index on “Employment Regulations and Working Conditions”. Again, this is a warning that legal
regulations need not tell what actually happens in work places.
Economic Freedom of the World (EFW)
Our third cross-check comes from the index of labor regulation compiled in the 2004
Economic Freedom of the World Report, sponsored by the Fraser Institute, whose assessment of
labor regulations is predicated on a position advocating laissez-faire institutions. The labor
regulation index (Area 5B of the EFW, Gwartney and Lawson, 2004) consisted of five
components: Impact of the minimum wage; Hiring and firing practices; Labor force share with
wages set by centralized bargaining; Unemployment insurance; and Use of conscripts. The first
four components incorporated information from recent editions (2001-2003) of the GCR, but we
25

For example, the GLS asked (in question 6.03) about the prevalence of private pension programs, an area that is
not covered by Botero et al.

22

still treated the overall index as a valid assessment of the extent of labor regulation. As shown in
the final row of Table 8, the EFW index was negatively correlated with most of the GLS indices
of workplace conditions, as it should since the EFW codes pro-labor regulation as undesirable.
In sum, our cross-checks show that most sources are in broad agreement on the
approximate ranking of countries regarding the degree to which their institutions favor labor
versus business interests. The union leaders and activists on the GLS, the business executives on
the GCR, and the conservative analysts for the Fraser Institute’s economic freedom measures are
in broad agreement about actual practices, though they presumably differ greatly in the value
judgments that they attach to the practices.

6.

CORRELATION WITH ECONOMIC OUTCOMES
Is the GLS ranking of countries by labor practices connected with broad economic

conditions? As a first step towards answering this question, we sorted the 33 countries into
quartiles based on the mean real GDP per capita from 2001-2003, as reported in the World
Development Indicators (WDI). Table 9 shows one dominant fact from this analysis: Countries
that are more developed tend to have more pro-labor workplace institutions and practices. The
mean (and median) scores on “Labor Market Conditions” through “Employee Benefits” (based
on Parts 2-6 of the GLS), as well as “% labor union” and “% collective bargaining” are higher as
we move towards higher income quartiles, although there is some tapering off between the 3rd
and 4th highest quartiles. In addition, richer countries had higher scores on the “General
Economic Situation” index, as well as a smaller “% informal sector”. These patterns are very
robust to an alternative sorting into income brackets, as given by the World Bank’s classification
of Developing, High-income non-OECD and OECD countries.

23

This systematic variation of workplace conditions with income levels is further
confirmed by Table10, which displays the results from a series of least-squares regressions of
various economic outcome variables on each GLS index in turn. The bivariate regressions on the
2001-2003 mean level of real GDP per capita point once again to more pro-labor conditions been
associated with higher country income levels.26
Column 2 of Table 10 examines the relation between the indices of labor institutions and
inequality of incomes, as measured by the Gini coefficients from Deininger and Squire (1996),
restricting the data to points they label as “high quality”. The consistently negative coefficients
on the various labor market indicators, as well as on “% labor union” and “% collective
bargaining” suggest that pro-labor institutions redistribute income towards employees.
The next column of Table 10 shows that the growth rate of real GDP per capita
(computed as an average over a three-year period, 2000-2003) is unrelated to labor practices.
With regards to the unemployment rate (also taken from the WDI),27 the “Freedom of
Association & Collective Bargaining”, “Labor Disputes” and “Employment Regulations &
Working Conditions” indices had positive coefficients that were significant at the 10% level,
suggesting a moderate correlation between pro-labor institutions and unemployment.28 Finally,
we explored the possible causal links in these relations, using a set of legal origin dummies as
instrumental variables for the GLS indices.29 In the IV estimates labor institutions remained
correlated to GDP per capita and inequality, but not to the growth rate and the unemployment
rate (regressions not shown).

26

We obtained similar results with a 5-year log average of real GDP per capita as dependent variable.
The unemployment rate for 2001 was used, as it was the most recent year in the WDI for which data was available
for almost all countries in our sample (31 out of 33 countries).
28
However, these coefficients are not significant if we remove the level of real GDP per capita from the regression.
29
The instrumental variables were dummies for British, French, German, Scandinavian and socialist legal origin.

7.

CONCLUSION
This study has demonstrated the feasibility of asking labor practitioners and experts over

the Internet about actual labor practices in their country. The GLS obtained responses from
nearly 1,600 respondents in a large number of countries. The responses tended to agree on
practices within country while showing considerable cross-country variation. Based on the
survey, we constructed labor market indices for 33 countries and found that our measures
correlated well with the estimates of labor market conditions and regulations from the
comparable GCR and Fraser EFW measures of labor markets around the world. The data
suggests further that workplace conditions that offer workers more safeguards and benefits tend
to be associated with countries with higher levels of income per capita and less inequality, are
unrelated to growth rates, and weakly positively correlated with unemployment rates.
The major weakness of the 2004 survey was the small sample of respondents from many
developing countries. In part, this was because e-mail lists included only a few practitioners in
those countries, and because weak Internet connections might have made it difficult for them to
respond. This suggests the need for expanding the reach of the survey by obtaining assistance
from country-based organizations to supplement the Internet sample through non-Internet-based
surveying, for example by inviting country practitioners and experts to fill out the surveys as part
of a conference. Translating the survey into more languages and having it available on a widely
used web site rather than as a stand-alone URL might also have increased the responses. In
addition, the survey would have benefited from more responses from personnel and labor
relations practitioners from the business community. Despite these shortcomings, the diagnostics

25

and the crosschecks with other data sources showed that the GLS captured useful information for
comparing actual labor market practices across countries.

countries for which the rwg statistic was less than 0.7 for the relevant subset of questions. Details of the calibration
procedure are in Section 3. The “Std Dev” column lists an upper bound of the standard deviation for the reported
mean, taking into account possible covariances between variables.

Notes: Indices range from 1 to 5, ranging from a 1 for an estimate of 0-20%, to 5 for an estimate of 81-100%. A *
denotes those countries for which the rwg statistic was less than 0.7 for the relevant subset of questions. Details of the
calibration procedure are in Section 3. The “Std Dev” column lists an upper bound of the standard deviation for the
reported mean, taking into account possible covariances between variables.

Notes: Summary statistics in bold are for the sample of 33 countries. Countries are sorted into quartiles based on the observed distribution of mean real GDP per
capita (in constant 2000 US$) for the years 2001-2003, taken from the World Development Indicators (WDI), with Quartile 1 corresponding to the lowest income
quartile etc. The sorting of countries into Developing, High-income non-OECD and OECD countries is based on the World Bank’s classifications; there were 11,
4, and 18 countries in these respective categories. Although the WDI does not report income data for Taiwan, we placed Taiwan in Quartile 3 and classified it as
a high-income non-OECD country, together with Singapore, given that the CIA World Factbook estimates PPP-adjusted real GDP per capita between Taiwan
and Singapore in 2004 to be very similar (US$23,400 for Taiwan and US$23,700 for Singapore).

Notes: Separate regressions are run for each dependent variable and each labor market index in turn. The coefficients on the labor market variables, robust
standard errors and R2 values are reported. *, **, and *** denote significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% levels respectively. The number of observations for the
regressions on income and the growth rate is 32, with Taiwan dropping out because of missing income data. The number of observations for the regressions on
inequality is 29, with Austria, Cyprus, Israel and Switzerland dropping out because of missing inequality data. The number of observations for the regressions on
the unemployment rate is 31, due to missing unemployment data from India and Taiwan.
