Estimating Bank Trading Risk: A Factor Model Approach
James O’Brien and Jeremy Berkowitz
NBER Working Paper No. 11608
September 2005
JEL No. G21
ABSTRACT
Risk in bank trading portfolios and its management are potentially important to the banks’ soundness
and to the functioning of securities and derivatives markets. In this paper, proprietary daily trading
revenues of 6 large dealer banks are used to study the bank dealers’ market risks using a market
factor model approach. Dealers’ exposures to exchange rate, interest rate, equity, and credit market
factors are estimated. A factor model framework for variable exposures is presented and two
modeling approaches are used: a random coefficient model and rolling factor regressions. The results
indicate small average market exposures with significant but relatively moderate variation in
exposures over time. Except for interest rates, there is heterogeneity in market exposures across the
dealers. For interest rates, the dealers have small average long exposures and exposures vary
inversely with the level of rates. Implications for aggregate bank dealer risk and market stability
issues are discussed.

Estimating Bank Trading Risk: A Factor Model Approach
1. Introduction
Bank dealers play a central role in securities and derivatives markets and are active
traders in their own right. Their trading risks and risk management are important to the
banks’ soundness and the functioning of securities and derivatives markets. In this paper, we
use proprietary daily trading revenues of 6 large bank dealers to study their market risks
using a market factor model approach. We estimate the bank dealers’ exposures to exchange
rate, interest rate, equity, and credit market factors.
Traditionally, the safety and soundness of the banking system has been the principal
focus of interest in bank dealer risk. Important for this purpose is the level of market risk
taken by bank dealers and commonality in their risk exposures. In recent literature, the focus
has been extended to the effects of bank dealer and other trading institutions’ risk
management policies on market stability. In using risk measures based on market volatility
and in particular Value-at-Risk (VaR), it has been argued that institutions’ demands for risky
assets will move together, which will lead to exaggerated price movements and market
instability. When market volatility is low, institutions will increase demands to hold risky
assets, putting upward pressure on prices and, when market volatility becomes high,
institutions will attempt to reduce their positions in risky assets, putting downward pressure
on prices. This behavior is said to have exaggerated market instability in the late summer
and fall of 1998 following the Russian ruble devaluation and debt moratorium and the near
failure of LTCM. 1

and Zigrand (2002), Persaud (2002), and Morris and Shin (1999). For different analyses of the risk-taking
incentives and portfolio choice effects of a VaR constraint, see Basak and Shapiro (2001), Cuoco and Liu
(2003), and Alexander and Baptista (2004).

Despite the strong interest, there has been little study of bank dealer risks and risk
management and there appears to be little formal evidence on the size, variation, or
commonality in dealer risks. In significant measure, this owes to limited public information
on dealer positions and income which limits the study of dealer risks and risk management.
Individual banks report on trading positions and revenues only quarterly and reporting is
limited to securities and derivatives in broad market categories. While there is weekly
reporting, it includes security positions and transactions but only limited information on
derivatives and data is reported only for aggregated primary (bank and non-bank) dealers. 2
Bank VaRs, which forecast the maximum loss on the trading portfolio with a given
confidence, provide a direct measure of market risk. However VaRs do not reveal the
dealers’ underlying market exposures or their size. Berkowitz and O’Brien (2002) also found
the risk forecast performance of the daily VaRs for the banks examined in this study to be
weak. Further, there was no common pattern in the correlation of VaRs across the banks.
Here we apply a factor model to the daily trading revenues of 6 large bank dealers to
estimate their market risk exposures. Factor models have long been used to study portfolio
and firm market risks (e.g., Chen, Roll and Ross (1986), Flannery and James (1984)). Closer
to our objectives is their application to mutual fund and hedge fund returns to characterize
the market risks in the funds’ portfolios (e.g., Sharpe (1992), Fung and Hsieh (1997)).
With daily trading revenues, we can study the effects of daily market price moves on
the banks’ trading portfolios. Also, the sample sizes are large, about 1200 daily observations
per bank. However, the trading revenue data is subject to significant limitations as well.

2

Jorion (2005) analyzes bank dealer trading risks and VaRs and implications for systemic market risk using
quarterly reported trading revenues and VaR-based market risk capital requirements. Adrian and Fleming
(2005) provide a description of data collected and reported for primary securities dealers and present some
evidence on dealer risk-taking based on dealer financing data.

Risk exposures can be inferred only through effects on trading revenues. Trading revenues
include fee and spread income and net interest income, as well as market gains and losses on
positions. Further, while used by the banks internally and required for VaR model testing,
the daily trading revenues lack the accounting scrutiny accorded to quarterly reports.
In the standard factor model, factor coefficients represent estimates of fixed portfolio
exposures. For bank dealers, exposures are variable, as dealers actively trade their positions
and are not buy and hold investors. Thus, the standard factor model approach may not apply
here. This leads us to first consider a factor model framework and estimation issues when
positions are variable. The framework is used in implementing two empirical modeling
approaches where trading positions are variable.
One approach is a random coefficient model, where the factor coefficients represent
randomly varying market factor exposures. Using the random coefficient framework of
Hildreth and Houck (1968), the dealers’ mean exposures to different market factors and the
variances of exposures are estimated. Estimates of average daily market risk exposures are
small relative to average trading revenues and cannot account for much of the trading
revenue variation. The signs of the exposures also differ across the banks, indicating
heterogeneity in average exposures. A notable exception is for the interest rate factor where
all banks but one exhibit small net long exposures to interest rate risk.
Even with small average exposures risk-taking could still be large, since dealers could
vary positions between large long exposures and large short exposures. Our estimates
indicate significant variation in market exposures that include both long and short positions.
Nonetheless, the ranges of potential variation in trading revenues due to variation market
exposures do not appear large relative to the total variation in trading revenues.

4

The random coefficient model is based on highly simplifying assumptions about the
variability in exposures. Especially important is the assumption that exposures are
independent of the market factors, which conflicts with portfolio strategies that are related to
market prices. This issue has also been important in hedge fund studies, some of whom have
tailored the functional form of the factor model to certain types of portfolio strategies. It is
argued below that specifying an appropriate functional form requires a good deal of
specificity on the portfolio strategy. However, our information on bank dealer strategies is
too sparse to formulate a specific portfolio strategy or unambiguously interpret results from
alternative functional forms that might be used.
A more limited approach to considering market price-dependent trading strategies is
taken here. For each bank, a linear factor model with a 150-day rolling sample is estimated.
Using historical plots, the 6 banks’ rolling regression factor coefficients are compared to the
respective factors’ contemporaneous 150-day rolling means. The latter will reflect periods of
rising and declining market prices. Of interest is whether the rolling coefficients move
systematically with the factors. This would indicate that the dealers’ market exposures vary
with the market factors and, hence, a possible price-dependent trading strategy.
For all factors but interest rates, the 6 banks’ rolling factor coefficients show no
common movement with the factors’ rolling means. For the interest rate factor, the banks’
rolling factor coefficients tend to vary inversely with the level of the interest rate. This
would be consistent with the interest rate durations for their trading portfolios becoming
larger (smaller) when rates are declining (rising).
The samples for the factor regressions include many days when factor changes are
small. However, the conclusions are basically the same if we restrict the analysis to days of

5

large price movements. The banks’ trading revenues do not show a common systematic
relation with large price changes for the non-interest rate factors but trading revenues tend to
be abnormally low on days of relatively large interest rate increases.
In sum, our principal findings are significant heterogeneity across dealers in their
market exposures, relatively small exposures on average and a limited range of long or short
exposures. Commonality in dealer exposures is limited to interest rate risk with exposure
levels inversely related to the level of rates. The implications of these results for aggregate
bank dealer risk and market stability are discussed in the concluding section to the paper.
The remaining sections are as follows. In the next section, the bank data and the
distribution of trading revenues are described. The factor model framework and empirical
model specifications are developed in section 3. The estimation and results for the random
coefficient model are presented in section 4; the rolling regressions in section 5; and the
relation between trading revenues and large market price changes in section 6.

2. Bank Trading Revenues
The Basel Market Risk Amendment (MRA) sets capital requirements for the market
risk of bank holding companies with large trading operations. The capital requirements are
based on the banks’ internal 99th percentile VaR forecasts with a 1-day horizon. Banks are
required to maintain records of daily trading revenue for testing their VaR models. The daily
trading revenue for 6 large trading banks is used in this study. 3
All of the banks in the study meet the Basel MRA “large trader” criterion and are
subject to market risk capital requirements. Four of the 6 banks are among the largest
derivatives dealers world wide and the other two are among the largest in the U.S. The 6

trading banks and the sample periods for each bank were selected so as to exclude banks or
periods for which there was a major merger which could substantially change the size and
mix of trading. So as not to reveal dollar magnitudes, trading revenues are divided by the
sample standard deviations of the respective banks’ trading revenues.
Trading revenues are for the consolidated bank holding company and include gains
and losses on trading positions, fee and spread income from customer transactions, and net
interest income. Trading positions are required to be marked-to-market daily. Some
smoothing of daily valuations is possible, although this would conflict with mark-to-market
accounting rules. In this study, pricing inaccuracies are necessarily treated as a residual item.
An attempt is made to represent the effects of fee and spread income and net interest income
on trading revenues using proxy variables.
In Figure 1, kernel densities for the banks’ trading revenues (divided by trading
revenue standard deviations) are presented. A normal distribution having the same means and
standard deviations as the banks’ distributions is provided for reference. Descriptive
statistics are presented in Table 1. As Figure 1 and Table 1 show, trading revenues are
typically positive. For the median bank, mean daily trading revenues equal .78 trading
revenue standard deviations. As shown in the bottom of Table 1, losses occurred on less than
20 percent of trading days for any bank. The typically positive trading revenues likely reflect
the importance of fee and spread income and net interest income.
The trading revenue distributions also have high peaks and heavy tails, as revealed in
Figure 1 and by the excess kurtosis statistics in Table 1. The 5% and 95% quantiles for the
banks’ trading revenues in the bottom panel of Table 1 lie inside 5% and 95% quantiles that
would be consistent with a normal distribution. The 1% and 99% and the .05% and 99.5%

7

quantiles lie outside quantiles consistent with a normal distribution. There also is no
indication of any common skewness in the banks’ trading revenue distributions
To provide more information on the heavy tails, the lowest and highest 10 percent
returns for each bank are plotted by historical dates in Figure 2. The plotted values are
expressed as deviations from trading revenue means and are divided by sample standard
deviations. With some exceptions for bank 1, the lowest 10 percent returns are all losses.
Several features of Figure 2 are notable.
One is that, while there is temporal clustering in both high and low returns, the
clustering tends to be greater for low returns. This asymmetry in temporal clustering may be
due to periodic large fees earned by dealers from customer transactions that are more evenly
dispersed through time. In contrast, low returns are likely to reflect mostly portfolio losses
from adverse market moves and persistency in market volatility (operational costs are not
included in trading revenues).
A second and related feature of Figure 2 is that all of the banks encountered loss
clustering, with some also experiencing positive spikes, during the market turmoil in the late
summer and fall of 1998. The market instability during this period had important common
effects on the banks’ trading revenues. For all 6 banks, daily averages of trading revenues
for the second half of 1998 were low and this period had a large effect on the full sample
trading revenue kurtosis for banks’ 1, 2, 3, and especially 6. 4
It should be noted that variation in dealer positions is also a potentially important
determinant of the trading return distribution. The dependency of the trading return

For the second half of 1998, daily averages of trading revenues for banks 1 to 6 were respectively .55, .39, .22, .15, .15, .39. If the second half of 1998 is excluded from the sample, the excess kurtosis for banks’ 1
through 6 are respectively 4.30, 2.63, 2.84 4.42, 6.07, and 4.64. See Table 1 for comparable statistics for the
full-period samples.

distribution on the dynamic management of positions under a VaR-constraint is a major
feature in Basak and Shapiro (2001).
Table 2 presents cross-bank correlations for daily trading revenues above the diagonal
and, for comparison, cross-bank daily VaR correlations below the diagonal. The trading
revenue correlations are all positive and significant using a standard t-test. The potential
contribution of exposures to market factors on the trading revenue correlations is considered
below. In contrast, the bank VaR correlations show no common pattern, as correlations are
both positive and negative and vary widely.

3. Factor Model with Varying Positions
A factor model framework when positions are variable is developed here and used to
guide the empirical specifications. Consider a portfolio with positions in K risky securities
and a risk-free asset. Positions in securities and the risk-free asset may be long or short and
include those held indirectly through derivatives. For measuring the portfolio’s sensitivity to
market factors, bid-ask spreads are abstracted from and the values of short or long positions
are measured at a single price, e.g., the mid-market price. The portfolio can be adjusted
continuously but returns are observed only for discrete time units.
Let t denote time measured in discrete units. At the start of t, the bank holds an
amount xkt0 in risky security categories k = 1,", K and x0t0 in the risk-free asset, which are
referred to as the bank’s positions. Positions may be carried over from t-1 or new positions
may be set at the start of t prior to any price changes since t-1. Positions and prices measured
at the end of period t are denoted by xk (t ) , x0 (t ) and pk (t ) . The price of the risk-free asset is
fixed at 1. Using this notation, the values of the portfolio at the start of t and at the end of t
are respectively
9

K
⎛ p (t ) ⎞
W (t ) ≡ ∑ xk (t ) pk (t − 1) ⎜ k
⎟ + x0 (t ),
k =1
⎝ pk (t − 1) ⎠

For the factor model, we want to expresses the 1-period change in the portfolio value
as a function of 1-period changes in market prices rk (t ) ≡ ( pk (t ) − pk (t − 1) ) / pk (t − 1). If
positions are fixed, the change in the portfolio value will be determined by the 1-period
market price changes. However, if positions are variable, the change in the portfolio value
can be affected by intra-period price movements not revealed in the 1-period price changes.
Thus, the suitability of a factor model when portfolio values are observed only discretely
requires restrictions on intra-period position and/or possibly price changes. A highly
simplifying assumption made here is that intra-period changes in security positions and
prices are uniform over the period. This assumption becomes accurate for very short periods
and it may be a reasonable approximation for 1-day returns. It implies that the intra-period
position and price changes can be measured from the full period changes.
A second assumption is made to avoid complications from outside cash infusions or
withdrawals: There are no exogenous intra-period capital flows to the portfolio and intraperiod cash payments and accrued interest on positions are accumulated in a separate
account. Under this assumption, changes in positions at any time τ within period t, dxkt (τ ),
made at prices pkt (τ ), will satisfy a self-financing constraint:

K

∑ dx

(τ ) pkt (τ ) + dx0t (τ ) = 0.

Using the self-financing constraint and (1), the change in the portfolio value over the
period, w(t ) ≡ W (t ) − W 0 (t ), is

where Δxk (t ) is the change in the position over period t (see Appendix). Note that
xkt0 pk (t − 1) +

1
Δxk (t ) pk (t − 1) is the average position in the period valued at the price of k at
2

the end of t-1.
The change in the portfolio value can be expressed using a factor model form:

K

(3)

w(t ) = ∑Vk (t )rk (t )
k =1

where Vk (t ) ≡ ( xk0 (t ) + 1/ 2Δxk (t ) ) pk (t − 1) . Vk (t ) is the value of the portfolio position in
factor k and measure’s the portfolio’s exposure to factor shock rk (t ) . Unlike the standard
factor model assumption, the factor exposures are not constant. With daily data, they would
reflect time-varying daily average positions. Two specifications of (3) will be considered.
For the first specification, Vk (t ) is assumed to be a random draw from a stationary
process with mean Vk . Further, the positions’ values, Vk (t ) , are assumed to be independent
of market factor changes and mutually independent. Under these conditions, the portfolio
return in (3) satisfies the random coefficient models developed in Hildreth and Houck (1968).
With Vk as the mean position value in factor k and vk (t ) ≡ Vk (t ) − Vk as the random
change in the position value, the details of the factor model can be expressed by

11

σ v v is the variance for factor position k; σ ww is the unconditional variance of changes in the
k k

portfolio value the portfolio, and ωkl is the covariance (variance) for individual factors
rk (t ) and rl (t ) . For the analysis below, it is assumed that μk = 0.
Equation (4a) expresses the change in the value of the portfolio as the sum of change
in value conditioned on average positions and the change in value conditioned on the
positions’ realized random components, the latter being defined in (4.b). (4.c) and (4d) are
the portfolio’s unconditional mean change and variance. The unconditional variance is the
K

sum of the variances for

∑ r (t )V
k =1

k

k

and u(t ) . The variance is the sum of the factor variances

and covariances weighted by the mean positions plus the sum of the products of the factor
variances and position variances. Thus, with variable positions, the volatility of positions
interacts with the volatility of the factors in determining the dispersion of portfolio returns.
The factor model in (4) also provides for the correlation between the changes in
banks’ i and j portfolio values that come from market factor shocks. This correlation
represents a measure of cross-bank commonality in market risks. Using subscripts for banks’
i and j, we have (see Appendix)
12

(5)

ρ w w = ρ wˆ wˆ
i

j

i

j

RSi RS j + ρ ui u j 1 − RSi 1 − RS j

where wi (t ) = wˆ i (t ) + ui (t ), wˆ i (t ) ≡ r (t )Vi and ui (t ) is the residual for bank i in (4.b).
Equation (5) describes two sources of commonality in banks’ market risks. ρ wˆ i wˆ j is
the correlation between changes in i and j’s portfolio values when factor exposures are
conditioned on the mean positions. One source of commonality is similar mean positions,
which would make ρ wˆ i wˆ j positive. ρ uiu j is the correlation associated with the variation in
positions as reflected in ui (t ) and u j ( t ). A second source is common variation in positions.
RSi and RS j determine the relative importance of these two sources of correlated returns.
RSi is the (population) R-square from a regression of i’s portfolio value changes on market
factors with factor coefficients set at their means ( RSi ≡ σ wˆ i wˆ i / σ wi wi ) .
Using the random coefficient model and with observations on trading portfolio value
changes and market factors, it is possible to estimate the bank dealers’ average factor
positions and their variances and some components of the cross-bank correlations.
The assumptions of course are restrictive and limit the generality of results. The
assumption that position changes are mutually independent is one of notational convenience
but potentially important for empirical tractability if there are many factors. Dropping this
assumption would require recognizing all the covariances between position changes in (4.d).
Assuming that market exposures are independent of factor changes is particularly
limiting because portfolio management may be related to market price movements. As
discussed earlier, such polices have been said to adversely affect market stability. Dropping

13

the assumption of independence has important effects on the factor model formulation and,
specifically, can make portfolio returns non-linear in the factor changes, rk (t ) .
An illustration of this is when the portfolio is managed such that returns resemble a
call or put option on say security k. The option-like portfolio implies a position in the
security and a cash position. Changes in the security price have both first-order and higherorder effects on the portfolio return. The higher-order effects imply changes in the security
and cash positions that are related to the factor price change. For security k, Δxk (t ) in (2) is
positive and depends on the price change, rk (t ) . A second-degree polynomial provides a
second-order approximation to the effect of the market factor on the portfolio value.

(6)

w(t ) = ak0 (t ) rk (t ) + bk0 (t )( rk (t )) 2

The coefficient for the linear component in (6) is analogous to the option’s delta and that for
the quadratic component to the option’s gamma.
Non-linear portfolio return equations such as (6) and returns expressed as functions of
traded option values have been used in hedge fund studies to capture positions that vary with
market returns. 5 However, a particular portfolio strategy, including the strategy horizon, is
needed to specify or interpret a particular functional form. For example, the strategy
specified in the preceding illustration implies the squared market factor in (6) reflects the
non-linear sensitivity of the portfolio to the market factor, i.e., the option’s “gamma.”
Without this specification, the interpretation of the squared factor would be ambiguous (e.g.,

5

Chan et al (2004) use higher-order polynomials in market factors to capture non-linearity in hedge fund
returns. Agarwal and Naik (2004) use returns to call and put options as the factors in hedge fund factor
regressions to capture the non-linearity between the hedge fund’s returns and the underlying market factors that
arises from option-type trading strategies. Mitchel and Pulvino (2001) apply a piecewise linear factor model in
returns to risk arbitrage strategies

14

it might represent the sensitivity of the portfolio value to market volatility). Further, the
coefficients ak0 (t ) and bk0 (t ) expressed in (6) are for period t. They depend on the security
value at the start of the period and also the portfolio management horizon (option’s time to
expiration). Treating the two coefficients as constants implies that the portfolio is being
rebalanced to a constant composition and horizon at the start of each sample observation,
e.g., each month if observations are monthly.
For bank dealers, we have little specific information on their portfolio strategies and
are not testing a specific strategy. This lack of specificity includes the time dimension of the
dealer’s strategy as it relates to our daily observation period.
A less formal approach to price-dependent strategies is taken here. For each bank, we
estimate a linear regression of trading revenues on market factor changes (and non-market
factor variables) with 150-day daily rolling samples. For the 6 banks, the estimated rolling
coefficients are plotted along with coincidental 150-day rolling means for the respective
factors (factor price levels, not changes). The 150-day rolling means will reflect periods of
rising or declining market prices. Of interest is whether the rolling factor coefficients move
systematically with the factors. This would indicate dealers’ market exposures vary with the
market factors and, hence, a possible price-dependent strategy. The significance of any
comovement will be judged according to whether or not it is common among the 6 banks.
While observed comovement between the factor coefficients and the factors would
indicate that the dealers’ market exposures are related to the market factors, this may still not
uniquely identify the price-dependent portfolio strategy. We consider this issue in evaluating
the rolling regression results.

15

Before presenting the empirical factor models, the treatment of other components of
trading revenues needs to be mentioned: (1) Portfolio revenues include accrued and explicit
interest payments and payments for risk-bearing. (2) Trading revenues also includes fee and
spread income from market-making. We do not have direct measures of these additional
components. Proxy variables are used to capture the effects of trading volume and net
interest income on dealer trading revenues. (3) Portfolio revenues also are affected by (interperiod) changes in the portfolio’s capital. Changes in the capital of the portfolio are not
explicitly accounted for other than what can be represented by a trend variable.

4. Random Coefficient Model

We first describe the explanatory variables used in the empirical analysis.
4.1. Explanatory Variables
In selecting market factors, four broad market categories are represented: exchange
rates, interest rates, equity, and credit spreads. For exchange rates, equities, and credit
spreads multiple factors are used for each category. A 10-year U.S. Treasury rate is used to
capture interest rate risk in the trading portfolio. In an earlier version, a 10-year rate and a 3month rate were used, with qualitatively similar coefficients estimated for both factors.
There are a total of 11 market factors, which are identified in the top panel of Table 3 with
descriptive statistics.
For exchange rate factors, regional exchange rate indices were constructed. They are
weighted averages of log changes in individual country exchange rates. The exception is
Russia, the only Eastern Europe country for which we had historical data. The weights are
shown in the bottom panel of Table 3. They were constructed from world-wide dealer FX
spot and derivatives turnover reported in BIS Central Bank Surveys in 1998 and 2001.
16

Exchange rate and equity factors are measured as log differences; interest rate and
credit spread factors are first differences. For the exchange rate and equity market factors,
positive differences indicate increases in asset values and, for the interest rate and credit
spreads, positive differences indicate decreases in asset values.
In addition to the market factors, a proxy variable is used to represent trading volume
that generates fee and spread income. We have do not have direct information on dealers’
daily transactions and use de-trended daily volume on the NYSE plus NASDAQ to represent
a market volume influence on trading revenue. Also, we do not have data on net interest
income from trading positions. To proxy for net interest income, we use a monthly lagged
moving average of the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate. This is intended to represent the gradual
realization in the portfolio of upward and downward movements in interest rate levels.
A trend variable is used to capture any trend in the level of the bank’s activity.
Lagged trading revenue is also included. If dealers smooth position revaluations, this could
produce serially correlated returns.
4.2. Market Risk Estimates
We use the GLS random coefficient estimators developed by Hildreth and Houck
(1968) to estimate the banks’ mean exposures to the market factors, Vk shown in (4.a), and
the exposure variances, σ vk vk shown in (4.d) and (4.e). 6 For the estimation we are assuming
that vk (t ) is iid, independent of the market factors and that vk (t ) and vl (t ) are independent
for k ≠ l . The residual in the trading revenue equation will include the residual that arises
from random position changes, i.e. u(t ) in (4.b), as well as any independent sources of

β estimator in (25), p. 589, to

trading revenue not accounted for in the model. Under these assumptions, Hildreth and
Houck provide unbiased and consistent estimators of the mean coefficients and coefficient
variances. Here, we allow only the 11 market factors to have variable coefficients.
Appendix Tables A.1 and A.2 contain the detailed regression results. Reported
coefficients are estimated using trading revenues divided by sample standard deviations and
thus measure trading revenue effects in terms of trading revenue standard deviations. The
estimates are discussed here using several summary tables. In the top part of Table 4,
summary statistics for the regressions estimating mean exposures to the market factors and
including other regressors are presented. As shown, the full set of regressors has significant
explanatory power based on F-values and regression R-squares. However, the F-values
measuring the joint explanatory power for the 11 market factors are not very high and do not
exceed the .05 critical value for 2 banks. Thus the market factors do not have a lot of
explanatory power (excluding these factors from the regressions, causes the R-squares to
drop by about 4 basis points). Since the factor coefficients reflect the estimated mean factor
exposures, this implies that average market exposures cannot account for much of the
variability of trading revenues.
In contrast, equity volume, used as a proxy for market transactions volume, is positive
for all banks and highly significant for all but one bank (Appendix Table A.1). Trading
revenues also have a significant positive trend. The estimated coefficients for the movingaverage interest rate (to proxy interest income) and lagged trading revenue have mixed signs
and significance across the banks.
The bottom part of Table 4 presents summary statistics for the regressions estimating
the variances of the market factor coefficients. While R-squares are low, the F-values are

18

highly significant, implying significant variability in the market factor coefficients. The
estimator used for the variances of the market factor coefficients is unbiased under the model
assumptions. While Hildreth and Houck suggest constraining the coefficient estimates to
non-negative values (pp. 587-589), this constraint was not imposed here. A little more than a
third of the estimated coefficients are negative, although only 2 are significant at a .05 level
and 1 at a .01 level (Appendix Table A.2). We regard the negative coefficients as reflecting
sampling error and exclude them evaluating the variability of the dealers’ market exposures.
We have no reason to believe that this biases our interpretation of the results
In Table 5, two measures of the dealers’ potential exposures to large market factor
shocks are constructed using Appendix Tables A.1 and A.2. The top number in each cell is
equal to the respective factor’s coefficient from Table A.1—the estimate of the bank’s mean
exposure to the factor—multiplied by a two standard deviation shock to the factor. Recall
that the coefficient estimates measure trading revenue effects in terms of trading revenue
standard deviations. Hence, the top number in the cell measures trading revenue effects in
terms of trading revenue standard deviations from a two standard deviation factor shock.
The two numbers underneath are the 2.5% and 97.5% estimated quantiles for factor
exposures, i.e., 95 percent intervals. The quantile estimates use the estimated mean
coefficients (Table A.1) and coefficient variances (Table A.2), and assume the coefficients
are normally distributed. The quantile estimates also are multiplied by two standard
deviation factor shocks. The shaded cells indicate where coefficient variance estimates are
negative (a zero interval is reported but is not used the analysis below).
Consider first the estimated mean factor exposures (the top number in each cell).
The estimates are small compared to the mean trading revenues shown in Table 1. For all

19

factors, a 2 standard deviation market factor shock produces less than a .3 standard deviation
change in a bank’s trading revenue and less than a .1 standard deviation change in trading
revenue for two-thirds of the factors. For the median bank, mean trading revenues equal .78
standard deviations. Thus, 2 standard deviation shocks to individual factors and even to
multiple factors would still leave a positive expected trading revenue.
Among individual market categories, the estimated mean exposures for the interest
rate factor are negative for 5 of 6 banks. The negative exposures would imply bank dealers
have (small) net long exposures to interest rate changes on average, i.e., the portfolio
duration is positive. For the three other broad market categories, however, there does not
appear to be a clear pattern of directional mean exposures to these market categories,
although coefficients are mostly positive for the W. Europe exchange index. Generally, the
coefficients vary in sign across broad market categories for a given bank and for the most
part across banks for a given factor.
Now consider the estimated 95-percentile intervals for the market factor exposures
reported under the mean exposure estimates in Table 5. The interval estimates cover both
positive and negative values, indicating factor exposures can vary between long and short
positions. Also, for the factor variances with non-negative estimates, the 95% coefficient
bounds are large relative to the estimated mean coefficients. However, the bounds do not
appear to be particularly large when measured against the trading revenue quantiles shown in
the bottom panel of Table 1.
Specifically, the 95% bounds in Table 5 measure potential trading revenue variation
from 2 standard deviation market factor shocks. Conditioned on a 2-standard deviation
factor shock, they represent 95% bounds on portfolio gains and losses. The trading revenue

20

quantiles in Table 1 measure trading revenue variation due to market factor shocks and
variation from other influences, such as market-making revenues. The bounds in Table 5
tend to be within the 1% and 99% quantiles for trading revenues shown in Table 1. Also, the
bounds in Table 5 are for 2 standard deviation market factor shocks. Thus, trading revenues
conditioned on estimates of relatively large factor exposures and factor shocks do not
produce extreme outliers relative to the unconditional variability of the trading revenues.
Overall, the results from the random coefficient model do not indicate that bank
dealers take large market risks relative to the size of average trading revenues and trading
revenue volatility and there is significant cross-dealer heterogeneity in exposures. However,
at times dealers may still have large exposures to particular factors creating the potential for
significant losses on days of extreme market conditions.
4.3. Cross-Bank Trading Revenue Correlations
As described earlier in section B, cross-bank trading revenues show small but
consistently positive correlations (Table 2). As shown in equation (5) above, cross-bank
trading return correlation due to market risk exposures can come from dealers either having
common average exposures to market factors or common variation in exposures. Based on
the random coefficient regression results, average factor exposures seem unlikely to be an
important source of cross-bank trading revenue correlation. This can be determined by
applying the mean and variance estimates of the random coefficients for the market factors to
estimate ρ wˆ i wˆ j RSi RS j in (5) for banks’ i and j. 7 The cross-bank correlation component

one bank this component is less than .02 (for banks 2 and 4, it is -.04).
If market exposures account for the most of the observed trading revenue
correlations, it must be mainly due to common changes in banks’ exposures, i.e., the
component ρ ui u j 1 − RSi 1 − RS j in (5). To determine this component, requires estimates of
the variable exposure component ui (t ) in each bank’s residual revenue (equation (4b)). The
best that can be done is to use the factor model regression residuals for ui (t ) to calculate

ρ u u 1 − RSi 1 − RS j for each combination of banks. Unfortunately, the regression
i j

residuals will include both ui (t ) and other unspecified components of trading revenues.
Nonetheless, correlations reported in the bottom panel of Table 6 were obtained by
calculating ρ ui u j 1 − RSi 1 − RS j using the regression equation residuals (correlations above
the diagonal are the trading revenue correlations displayed in Table 2). The correlations
below the diagonal typically are slightly more than half the trading revenue correlations
above the diagonal. Whether the former represent a small commonality in trading revenue
due to common market exposures or due to other common influences on trading revenues not
controlled for in the regressions is difficult to say. Employing different approaches, further
consideration is given to dealer commonality in market exposures in the next two sections

5. Rolling Regressions

In this section, we present estimates of market factor coefficients for daily rolling
regressions. Using OLS, each bank’s trading revenue is regressed on the market factors and
equation (4.e) in the text, using the estimated factor coefficients for Vk , the sample factor variances for
and the estimated factor coefficient variances used for

σv v

ωkk ,

other explanatory variables, including our proxy variables for trading volume and net interest
payment effects on trading revenues. The rolling window is 150 days. The first 150-day
regression ends on August 11, 1998 (August 14, 1998 for bank 1). The regression equations
are re-estimated daily dropping the last day and adding a new day using each bank’s
available sample period.
In Figures 3a – 3d, plots of rolling coefficients that are representative of the results
for the different broad market categories are presented along with 150-day coincidental
moving averages of the respective factors. The coefficients for each factor are in the same
units as the random coefficient model estimates in Appendix Table A.1 (average values of
the rolling coefficients are of the same order of magnitude as those in the random coefficient
model in Table A.1). The rolling means of factors are expressed as factor levels (not
differences). They show large ranges of variation over the sample period that includes a
business cycle peak in March 2000 and a trough in November 2001. The interest rate, equity
and credit spread factors (Baa and high yield) show evidence of business cycle influences.
Our interest is in whether the rolling coefficients vary systematically with the factors,
which would indicate that the dealers’ market exposures are related to market prices.
Consider first the coefficients for the interest rate factor plotted in Figure 3a. The
coefficients for all but bank 4 show a rising and declining pattern that roughly tracks the
rising and declining interest rate pattern. The pattern implies a tendency for the portfolio’s
interest rate exposure to move inversely with interest rates to the point where exposures may
go from long to short or short to long.
This pattern would be consistent with dealers’ reducing net long positions in longerterm securities when interest rates are rising even to the point of taking short positions.

23

When interest rates decline, dealers increase their net long positions so that, in low interest
rate environments, they tend to have relatively large interest rate exposures.
A more passive strategy also might be consistent with the results in Figure 3a. As
shown in equation (3), the factor coefficients measure factor exposures in terms of position
values. Rather than actively alter positions, dealers might have simply held their same
positions and allowed position values to deteriorate, even becoming negative, as rates
increased (prices declined) and then increase as rates subsequently declined. Against this
explanation, however, market analysts suggested that dealers were increasing their long-term
positions as interest rates declined to low levels in the early 2000s. 8
Aside from the explanation for the rolling interest rate coefficients, it is shown in
Table 7 that cross-bank correlations for the coefficients are all positive. This re-enforces the
impression from Figure 3a of common variation in the dealers’ interest rate exposures.
For the most part, the rolling coefficients for the other factors do not show any clear
patterns of comovement with their respective factors that are common to all or most banks.
In Figures 3b and 3c, plots are presented for the rolling coefficients and factors for the NYSE
and high yield spreads. These results are representative of results for the other factors as
well, excluding the Russian ruble (see below). For some individual banks, co-movement is
observed between the coefficients and factors—e.g., the NYSE rolling coefficients and
NYSE factor for bank 2. Whether this represents an underlying relationship for a particular
bank or just a chance realization of the data can’t be determined. Nonetheless, for the noninterest rate factors, the results do not indicate any covariation between the factor exposures
and the factors that is common among the dealers.

8

See Financial Times article by Jenny Wiggins, March 11, 2004. Also see Adrian and Fleming (2005), p. 4.

24

Something of an exception to these results is the behavior of the Russian ruble
coefficients shown in Figure 3d. For all 6 banks, the coefficients move toward zero in late
August and early September 1998 as the ruble declined precipitously. The estimated
coefficients remain close to zero until mid-1999 (several months after the August-October
1998 period passed out of the rolling samples). This behavior would be consistent the banks
becoming insulated against the ruble. 9

6. Dealer Trading Revenues on Days of Large Market Moves

The results from the two factor model approaches suggest that, in the aggregate, bank
dealers are not consistently on one side of the market, except possibly for (default-free)
interest rate exposures. However, as described in section 2, all 6 banks had abnormally low,
though still mostly positive, trading revenues in the latter part of 1998. This was a period
that included both high market volatility and sharp declines in credit and other risky asset
prices and increases in U.S. Treasury security prices. In a final exercise, we look to see
whether dealer trading revenues might be commonly related to price movements on days of
large price changes. This may not be evident in the factor model regressions based on the
full samples where on many days price changes are small.
For simplicity, days of relatively large price increases and, separately, price declines
are identified only for the broad market categories—exchange rate, equity, interest rate and
credit. For each market factor, days where factor shocks fall into the 1st quintile and the 5th
quintile are separately sorted. For a market category, a large market decline day (a large
market increase day) is defined as a day where at least one factor in the category is in the 1st
9

While difficult to see in the Figure, prior to convergence to zero, the rolling coefficients across the 6 banks
were quite different and included both positive and negative coefficient values, implying long and short
exposures in the ruble. Note also that the volatility of the ruble (measured as absolute daily log changes)
remained above pre-August 1998 levels over the rest of the year and into the first half of 1999.

25

(the 5th) quintile and none is in the 5th (the 1st) quintile. For example, a day when the
change in the NYSE index is in the 1st quintile and the NASDAQ index is not in the 5th
quintile is a large equity market decline day. Typically, when one factor in a market category
experiences a large change, other factor(s) in that category change in the same direction,
although this is less true for exchange rates (further description of the large factor changes is
provided in Table 8). Large market move days span the entire 6-year sample period but with
a higher frequency in the second half of 1998.
Mean and median bank trading revenues, for low and high market return days for
each of the four market categories are reported in Table 8. Except for the interest rate
category, mean and median trading revenues for the 6 banks on low return days in each of the
other market categories are not uniformly lower, or higher, than on high return days. For
these market categories, this comparison does not indicate that dealers market exposures bear
a common systematic relation to market prices. For the interest rate category, on days of
large rate increases, trading revenues are uniformly lower across the 6 banks than on days of
large rate declines, suggesting long (positive duration) interest rate exposures are typical.
These results are consistent with the results from the factor models.
While heterogeneity in exposures will reduce the likelihood of large aggregate dealer
losses, the chance realization of losses (or abnormally high returns) for a group of dealers is
still more likely during a period when volatility is high across markets. The summer and
autumn of 1998 was such a period and the higher volatility in the banks’ trading revenues is
apparent from Figure 2. 10 Nonetheless, with cross-bank heterogeneity in exposures, losses

10

We also looked at absolute trading revenues on days of high and low absolute changes in market factors,
where absolute values are used to measure the size of daily fluctuations or volatility. Days of high and low
volatility were defined at the market category level using an analogous procedure to that followed in
determining days of large market declines and large increases (Table 8), except in terms of the size of absolute

26

are likely to come from positions in different markets. For the 1998 third and fourth quarters,
major U.S. bank dealers reported quarterly losses or low revenues in different market
categories—interest rate (including credit), equity, and commodities. 11 For the 6 banks’
studied here, it was also the case that different banks reported quarterly losses or low returns
in different markets.

7. Conclusions

To recap the main results, the bank dealers do not consistently maintain exposures on
one side of the market, with the exception of small average long exposures to interest rate
risk. They vary their exposures in size and direction but, except for interest rate exposures,
the variation is heterogeneous across the dealers. Interest rate exposures tend to vary
inversely with the level of interest rates. Variation in trading revenues from market
exposures also does not seem large relative to the variation in total trading revenues that also
include fee, spread and net interest income.
These results are subject to important limitations imposed by limitations of the
trading revenue data that were used, inherent factor model limitations, and to a small sample
of bank dealers. Also, the two factor modeling approaches employ different underlying
assumptions whose consequences have not been examined. If these limitations are put aside,
a number of points can be made about the relation between dealer market risks, VaR, and
market prices based on the results.

factor changes. For each of the 6 banks, mean and median absolute 1-day trading revenues are consistently
higher on high market volatility days than on low market volatility days for all 4 market categories, with
significance at the .05 level for almost 75 percent of the mean and median calculations.

Currency, p. 13. Note that the quarterly revenue reports include fee and spread income, as well as changes in
position market values.

27

Heterogeneity in dealers’ market exposures reduces the likelihood that dealers as a
group will incur large losses in periods of market stress or that their aggregate risk taking
behavior contributes significantly to a “herding” phenomenon. The heterogeneity in
exposures also applies to arguments that dealers’ common use of VaR for risk management
leads to herding behavior. Shifts in market volatility could produce common changes in
dealers’ VaRs and desired risk exposures but without leading to common directional shifts in
risky asset demands because dealers have both short and long positions. A potential
exception is commonality in adjustments to interest rate risk exposures.
While heterogeneity in dealers’ market exposures reduces the likelihood of large
aggregate dealer losses, the chance occurrence of common losses (or abnormally high
returns) among banks is still more likely in a period of generally high market volatility. The
summer and autumn of 1998 was such a period when volatility was high across markets and
dealers’ losses or low returns occurred in different markets.
Especially during periods of extreme market conditions, there are areas of dealer
activity other than securities trading that may be more important to financial market stability
and bank risk. This would include dealers’ market-making role under extreme market
conditions. For example, see Routledge and Zinn (2004) with some empirical evidence on
the summer and autumn of 1998 in Furfine and Remolona (2002)). Also potentially
important is dealer, including parent bank, credit exposures to hedge funds and other
important market players. The issue of bank credit exposures to hedge funds and large
market players is taken up in Kho, Lee, and Stulz (2000), Furfine and Remolona (2002), and
Chan, Getmansky, Hass, and Lo (2005).

Factor Model Derivations

1. Factor Model Portfolio Value (equation (2))
Here the 1-period change in the value of the portfolio shown in equation (2) is
derived. Two assumptions are used. One is a self-financing constraint within the period,

(τ ) pkt (τ ) + dx0 t (τ ) = 0. The second is that price and position changes within the

period are uniform: dpkt (τ ) = Δpk (t )dτ and dxkt (τ ) = Δxk (t )dτ for t − 1 < τ < t. The starting
position for security k is xkt0 . The derivation uses continuous price and position changes
within the period. The change in the value of the portfolio is w(t ) ≡ W (t ) − Wt 0 .
Using the above assumptions and notation:

2. Cross-Bank Portfolio Value Correlation Due to Market Factors (equation (5))
The correlation in portfolio value changes between bank i and j due to market factor
shocks is derived under the assumptions used for the random coefficient model presented in
(4). The following vector notation is used here: r (t ) , Vi (t ) , Vi and vi (t ) are K × 1 vectors of

31

the market factors, factor coefficients, mean coefficients and random coefficient components,
respectively. The factor shocks r (t ) are assumed to have a zero expected value.

Using (4.a) in the text, w(t ) = ∑ rk (t )Vk + u (t ) and (4b), u (t ) ≡ ∑ rk (t )vk (t ) , the
expected cross-product of returns for banks i and j, conditioned on r (t ) , is:
(A.2)

E[ wi (t ) w j (t ) | r (t )] = Evi ,v j [(Vi′r (t ) + vi′(t ) r (t ))(V j′r (t ) + v′j (t ) r (t )) | r (t )]

where Evi v j [ g ( vi , v j ) | r (t )] ≡ ∫ " ∫ g ( vi1 ", v jK , r (t ) ) f ( vi1 ", v jK | r (t ) ) dvi1 ", dv jK . Using
vi 1

v jK

E[vi (t )] = 0 and independence between vi (t ) and r (t ) , Ev j [Vi′r (t ) r′(t )v j (t ) | r (t )] =

Evi [v′j (t )r (t )r′(t )V j | r (t )] = 0 . Using this orthogonality, (A.2) becomes
E[ wi (t ) w j (t ) | r (t )] = Vi′r (t ) r′(t )V j + Evi ,v j [vi′(t ) r (t ) r′(t )v j (t ) | r (t )]

1. Units for factor means and standard deviations: Exchange rates and equity means are daily log differences of levels; interest
rates and credit spreads are daily first differences of levels expressed as percentage points.
2. Credit spreads are spreads from treasury rates with the same maturity. Embi+ is JP Morgan's Emerging Markets Bond
Spread Index Plus.
3. Regional exchange rates are weighted log differences. Weights are based on world-wide dealer FX Spot and derivatives
turnover volume reported for different currencies. Turnover volume is taken mostly from the 2002 BIS Central Bank Survey.
The survey date is June April 2001. June 1998 turnover volume from the 1999 Central bank Survey is used to determine
weights for Western Europe currencies for pre-Euro 1998 (country coverage in the 1998 survey is limited).

1. Bank trading revenue is normalized by full sample bank trading revenue standard deviations. Sample sizes for each of the
"Decline" and "Increase" categories range from 167 to 606, depending on the bank. and the category. Sample sizes for each of
the "Decline" and "Increase" categories range from 167 to 606, with a median of 323. For each factor in its designated
market category (e.g., nyse for equity category), its mean value for the "Decline" quintile is 1 to 2 standard deviations below its
mean value for the "Increase."
*Significant at .05 for difference between "Decline" and "Increase" day trading revenue mean (median) value. Means test is a
standard difference of two means. Medians test uses the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank sum test for large samples.

1. Trading revenues are divided by the banks' sample standard deviations. Equity volume has been
scaled by 1 million. Coefficients are estimated for equation (4.a) in the text with additional
explanatory variables described in the text. A GLS estimator is used, which is described in Hilreth
and Houck (1968). See their description for β, second equation in (25), p. 589.
