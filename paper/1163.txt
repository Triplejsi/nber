Variable

Earnings

and Nonlinear Taxation

ABSTRACT

We explore the interaction between two facts. The first is that income is

variable; the second is that the tax and transfer system transforms before tax

income into after tax income in highly non—linear ways. The effect is to penalize (and reward) income variability in a manner which is both substantial and
capricious.

The earned income tax credit (EITC) is a refundable tax credit on the ear-

nings of families with dependents. It operates as an earnings subsidy and is
intended to encourage labor market participation. In 1982 the subsidy paid to
an eligible family with an earned income of $7500 was about $250. In this
paper, we show that, at least in one extreme case, the EITC provides instead

an incentive to leave the labor market of about $800 to a family with expected
income of the same $7500.

This seems a dramatic example of Milton Friedman's dictum that government
policies accomplish exactly the opposite of what they are intended to

accomplish. It is thus appropriate that another of Friedman's theories, the
permanent income hypothesis, should provide the simplest (but not the only)
explanation of how the EITC (and other aspects of the tax and transfer system)
should discourage work.

One of the main premises of the permanent income hypothesis is that income

is variable. Another is that income earners are (and policymakers and social
critics should be) more concerned with permanent or expected income than with
particular realizations of the random process which generates annual income.

Yet taxes are levied on current income. Since tax and transfer systems are nonlinear, they can substantially affect the transformation of random current
income into after tax expected income.

In this paper, we show that the current system of taxes and transfers in the
United States has substantial and capricious effects on the transformation of
current pretax income into permanent after tax income.

We examine not only

the EITC but also the federal income tax in general and transfer programs such
as AFDC (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) and Social Security. Not

all of these tax and transfer programs discourage work. For example, for

.2
families with an expected income of $5,000 who are eligible for the AFDC

program, the tax and transfer system provides a work subsidy of almost
$2,000.

The mechanism which causes these effects is straightforward. Since income
is variable we may write

where Y is expected (or, in Friedman's terms, permanent) income and
the transitory variation in income.'

represents

Taxes are levied on current income y,

rather than expected income Y. The tax and transfer system transforms current
income y into after—tax income x. We can write this in general form as

x =

B(y).

Expected after tax income is E[B(y)]. If we assume individuals base their
labor supply decisions on expected after—tax income, the shape of the schedule
B(.) determines how the tax and transfer system rewards or punishes variabi-

lity. If B(.) is concave, as it will be if the tax system is progressive,
then Jensen's inequality implies that the tax system will penalize variabi-

lity. If BC.) is convex, as it will be if the tax system is regressive, then
the tax system will reward risk. The tax and transfer system in the U.S. is
not consistently progressive or regressive. The EITC example given above (and
presented in more detail in Section III below) is an example of income

variability occurring in a region where B(.) is concave. In the AFDC
example, income variability occurred in a region where B(.) is convex.

We now discuss how to assay the magnitude of the effect we are examining.

The certainty equivalent after-tax income y is defined as the solution to

3

B(y) = E[B(y)].
We measure the effect of the tax system on variability by the ratio

R =

If

the tax system is linear, R will be equal to unity. Under a progressive

tax system, B(.) will be concave and R will be less than unity. Under a

regressive tax system R will be greater than unity. The tax and transfer
system in the United States is neither convex nor concave (see Haustnan (1983)
and Moffitt (1982)); there can be no general presumption that R is greater

or less than unity. We present calculations below which suggest that for
reasonable estimates of the size of the variable component of income, R ranges
from .78 to 1.38 for individuals with different tax statuses and different
levels of expected income.

Before we present these estimates it is worthwhile trying to think about

what R measures. At high income levels it is simply a way of measuring the
extent to which the tax system encourages or discourages risk taking.

However

in thIs paper we focus on the poor. We do so for two reasons. First, as
discussed in the next section, the amount by which R deviates from unity is
determined by two things; the size of the kinks in the tax system and the

amount by which income varies. In section III we present evidence which
suggests that in the U.S. the tax and transfer systems combine to produce a
very kinky tax system at low levels of income and that the earnings of the

poor are quite variable. These two factors interact to produce values of R
which differ significantly from unity. Our second reason for focusing on the
poor is that for them R may be given a more dramatic interpretation than the

mere encouragement or discouragement of risk taking. For many of the poor,

4

welfare and equivalent activities such as participation in training programs
offer an income stream that is far more certain than that obtainable from

participation in the labor market. R measures the ratio between expected
income available in the labor market and the equivalent certain income which

would make withdrawal from the labor market attractive. A low R ——

associated

with progressive taxes —— discourages labor market participation. A high R
encourages it. Under this interpretation, an R of .8 means that a welfare
program which offers certain income equal to 80% of expected (before—tax)

income is as attractive as participation in the labor market. Alternatively,
a guaranteed public jobs program at the same certain wage would be more
attractive than private—sector employment.

An unrealistically simple model underlies the discussion of the preceding

paragraph. We wrote as if the labor supply decision for an individual were
equivalent to deciding once a year whether or not to participate in a lottery.
If he does participate in the labor market he draws his annual labor market
income from a distribution with known characteristics and anticipates a net

gain of E[B(y)]. If he chooses not to participate he gets a certain income

of, say y. In making his labor supply decision he compares these two quantities and chooses to enter the labor market only if E[B(y)] > y. This story
is wrong for at least three reasons. First, the labor supply decision is made
continually through the year; individuals drop in and out of the labor market

and adjust their hours of work (when they can). Second, the benefits to be
gained from not participating in the labor market are not certain; eligibility

criteria and program benefits change. Third, we have assumed individuals are
risk neutral. Taking these factors into consideration seems quite difficult.
One of the contributions of this paper is the simple analytic formula of

5

equation (1) below which relates R to the variability of income and the cur-

vature of the tax system. We do not know how to modify this formula to take
these factors into account. It seems likely that a more realistic model of
labor supply and of welfare programs would reduce the size and significance of
the effects we report; abandoning risk neutrality would increase them.

II. How Different is R From Unity? Theoretical Results.
The magnitude of the effect we are looking at depends on the variability

of income and the shape of the tax system. In this section we present
calculations which show those parameter combinations that will produce

an R which is much different than unity. Our calculations are based on the
following observation which is proved in Appendix A. For a given probabi—
lity distribution of income F(s), the progressive tax system with maximal

marginal tax rate t which minimizes R is that which taxes all income above y

at rate T and leaves all income below y untaxed. (Of course, y is not independent of the tax system; it Is the solution to B(y) = E[B(y)]). The R minimizing tax system is a linear tax system with a single kink, a form of taxation
often advocated because of its simplicity.3

If income is lognormally distributed then there is a simple analytic
relationship (derived in Appendix B) between the marginal tax rate, t, the
coefficient of variation, c, and R:

(1)

T = (1-R)/[(l-((log R -

where () is
variable and

cJ2)/cl)) - R(1 -

((log R

+

the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal random

= log(lc2). Table 1 gives the results of calculations which

use this formula. In interpreting this table It is well to keep in mind that

6

it represents extreme cases. If income is log normally distributed with a
coefficient of variation equal to unity and if the highest marginal tax rate

is 51%, then the minimum value which R can assume is .8. R will attain this
value only if the tax system has a single kink, leaving all income less than

untaxed and taxing all income greater than y at a rate of 51%.
Furthermore only persons with a level of expected income equal to y will have
an R of .8; other persons with a different permanent income (but with current
income log normally distributed with the same coefficient of variation) will

have an R between .8 and 1. If the tax system has several brackets (but the
top bracket is 51%) then R is larger than .8.

We choose the lognormal for use in Table 1 for three reasons. First,
the lognormal permits us to obtain Table 1 analytically. Second, empirical
work on earnings commonly uses the log of earnings as a dependent variable;
it often assumes that earnings are lognorniaiiy distributed. As a consequence

most empirical reports of the variability of earnings are estimates of the

variance of log earnings, a2. If earnings are lognormally distributed, there
is a simple analytic relationship between this parameter and the coefficient
of variation, c:

c = (exp(a2) —

1)1k.

Since we measure variability of earnings by c, this correspondence is useful.
Finally, experiments with exponential, binomial, and truncated normal distri-

butions suggest that the results of table 1 are robust; if the mean and
variance of income are held constant, the first significant digits of the
entries in table 1 do not, for the most part, change when the table is recalculated using these distributions.

Table 1 shows that if income is variable, kinks of moderate size could make

7

R small for some people. Kinks, that is, changes in marginal tax rates, of the
order of .24 or .44 are, at minimum, necessary to produce reasonably low R's.
In the next section we present calculations for the United States which suggest
that for some people R is as low as .78; for others it is as high as 1.38.

III. How Different is R from Unity? Estimates of the Effects of Current United
States Tax and Transfer Programs.

In the previous section we have shown that, in the worst case, a single—
kink tax system would have to have a marginal tax rate of more than .24 to

generate an R of .90. In this section we calculate the ratio R for several
major tax and transfer programs in the U.S. to see if the kinks in those

programs can generate an R more than .10 or so away from one. We shall assume
that the log of earnings is normally distributed with mean p and variance a2.

Expected income is given by Y = exp(p + i/ a2). As we have observed above, a is

determined by the coefficient of variation, c. We shall perform our calculations for different values of expected income, Y, and c.
Since some of the largest kinks in the tax and transfer system occur near
the bottom of the income distribution, we shall pick several low values of Y.

But which values of c to examine is not as obvious. Cross—section earnings
regressions, such as those of Mincer (1974), provide values of c (calculated
from the estimated variance of log earnings) in the neighborhood of .60—.90.
However, it could be argued that cross—sectional variation exaggerates the
variation in transitory income for a single individual because of heteroge—

neity across individuals. Many authors have instead estimated earnings equations
from panel data; such a procedure yields an estimate of the variance in ear—

8

nings for the same individual over time. Most studies have done so with some
sort of error components structure —— see Lillard and Willis (1978) for one

example and MaCurdy (1982) for a more recent one with a very general structure

for the error term. These studies usually imply coefficients of variation (of
the transitory component of the error term) of from .50 to .80, with sub-

stantial differences across studies. Unfortunately for our purposes, the
variance of the transitory error is always assumed to be independent of the
level of the permanent income, so no information is provided on whether the
(permanently) low—income population has a larger variance than the rest of the

population. Studies which focus only on low—income individuals (e.g., Hausman
and Wise, 1979), maintain the same independence assumption In the stochastic

specification of the error term. Fortunately, Gottschalk (1981) has calculated the standard deviation of earnings over a six—year period for each individual in the National Longitudinal Survey of Men, and has tabulated the mean
of the standard deviations by the level of mean earnings over the period.
Professor Gottschalk graciously performed special tabulations for us which

sh that that coeffIcient of variatIon in the lowest quintile of the population is 1.35. It falls to about .50 in the next highest quintile and then

down to about .20 for the rest of the population. Since we are interested in
the low—income sector of the population, we shall therefore perform our calculations for c's ranging from .50 to l.35.

Federal Income Tax. Figures 1—4 show the disposable income schedules for
several tax and transfer programs. The first figure refers to the federal

personal income tax, including the earned income tax credit (EITC). For all
our calculations we have assumed a four-person family with a single earner and

no other Income. All tax and transfer programs are evaluated in their 1982

forms. As the figure shows, the present income tax actually

subsidizes ear-

nings up to $5,000 of income. This feature has been present since the
mid—1970's and is a result of the EITC, which is a refundable tax credit for

which families with dependents are eligible. While it IS

an earnings subsidy

up to $5,000, it becomes an earnings tax beginning at $6,000 because it must

be phased out. The marginal tax rate begins at —.10, is 0 at $5,000 and then
becomes a positive .13 at $6,000. A concave kink of about .23 is thereby

created (note that this is close to the .24 of Table 1). A further kink, one
which is convex, is created at about $11,000 of earnings, the point at which
the subsidy drops to zero and the regular marginal tax rates begin.

Our calculated values of R for the federal tax are shown in the first five

rows of Table 2. As should be expected, R is inversely related to c.
However, it is quadratically related to mean income because our middle ranges
of income fall around the concave kink and our high ranges fall around the

convex kink. CR would fall again at higher income levels.) As the results
show, R does fall to .90 and a bit below when c takes on a value of 1.35 and
the individual's permanent income is slightly above the concave kink ($7,500

in the table). In this particular case y is $6,685, more than $800 below Y.
This is a large amount in absolute terms. It is also large relative to the
effect of the tax system on after—tax permanent income——at

Y = $7500, the tax

system provides about a $250 subsidy to working as a result of the EITC
(indeed the intent of the EITC is to encourage work); but the effect of risk

on expected after—tax labor earnings Is almost three times this amount, and
negative.

Thus the phenomenon we are examining in this paper seems quan—

titively important relative to the usual effects of tax systems discussed in

10

certainty models ——at least if the coefficient of variation is high and if an
individual's permanent income falls in a certain range.

Aid

to

Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). The major transfer

program in the U.S. for poor families is AFDC. However, in most states only
families without an able—bodied male present in the household can receive
it.5

Hence the female—headed population is the largest beneficiary. In 1982

the statutory tax rate in the program in most states was .67, as shown in

Figure 2. This tax rate applies until benefits end, at which point the
point the federal income tax system (including the EITC) takes over.6
However, in some states ——

Indiana

is an example (Hausman, 1983) —— a range

of zero marginal tax rates is imposed at low earnings levels. In Indiana,
as shown in Figure 3, the zero rate applies over the first $1,000 of earnings.
The values of R for AFDC in Table 2 show that the convex kinks

generated by the transfer program can have sizable effects. At c = 1.35, R
reaches 1.38 if permanent income is $5,000, not far from the convex kink.

The value of y in this case is $6,900, almost $2,000 above Y —— again
a large amount. Moreover, It should be noted that all the R values
we have calculated are greater than 1.0, even those at Y = $12,500.

At higher

earnings levels, of course, R would fall below 1.0. But at $12,500 and below,
the c's we have used imply that the risk of falling below the eligibility
point is sufficiently high that the work—encouraging effects of the program
dominate the work—discouraging effects of the progressive rates at higher

points. The same is true in the Indiana AFDC system —— at the Y's we have
calculated, all the R's are still greater than 1 (even though somewhat smaller
than before because of the presence of the concave kink).7

11

Social Security. We have also calculated our R ratios for the Social
Security program because it contains (to the authors' knowledge) the most
8
severe concave kink of any major tax or transfer program in the U.S.

As shown

in Figure 4, Social Security benefits are not reduced unless earnings rise
above about $5,000, at which point they begin to be taxed on a 50 percent

rate. The federal tax begins at about $7,000, whereupon the marginal tax rate

rises to .65. Benefits end completely at about $16,000 of earnings, at which
point a large convex kink is generated.

As Table 2 shows, this program generates the lowest values of R of any

program we have considered. Those with permanent income in the range $5,000 —

$7,500 —— who are most affected by the concave kink —— have values of R that
are almost always below .90 and even below .80 at high values of c. At Y =

$7,500 and c = 1.35, y is almost $2,000 below Y. Consequently, to the extent
that the aged face risk in their labor earnings, this program would seem to

have significant work—discouraging effects at these low earnings levels. Of
course, at higher levels closer to the convex kink, values of R are greater
than one, as they are for any transfer program.

IV. Summary and Conclusion.
In this paper we have shown that the U.S. tax and transfer system has
potentially large effects on risk—taking in the labor market, effects which

vary greatly across individuals. Depending upon one's eligibility for different types of transfer programs and upon the mean and variance of an

individual's earnings, the effect may be quite large. For many, of course,

the effect discussed here will be insignificant. But the potential for large
effects suggests that these effects be taken into account in the design of such

12

programs ——

along with the usual efficiency and equity effects.

That these other effects —— which we have ignored ——

are

important should

be stressed. A superficial reading of this paper would suggest that its main
lesson is that regressive tax systems are desirable because they encourage

work. This is, of course, not our conclusion. We merely urge that the effect
of sharp kinks in the tax system on those with variable earnings be taken

into account in the design and analysis of tax systems. This topic cries out
for treatment as an optimal tax problem and for a more realistic model of the

labor supply decision. Both problems must be left for future work.

Appendix

A. We represent a tax system by a function B(y) which gives the amount
of after tax income retained by a person with a pretax income of y. A
progressive tax system is one in which B(.) is increasing, concave, and satis-

fies

B(O) = 0.

We say a tax system is i—admissible if it is increasing, concave, satisfies
(2) and it's maximum marginal tax rate is less than or equal to r.

An example of a i

admissible

tax system is the piecewise linear system

which does not tax income which is less than or equal to k and taxes income

greater than k at rate r. We denote such a tax system BTk(•) and define it
(

as follows:

port [0, M]. For a tax system B(.), define

For any c(O,l) there is a unique solution to the equation

E[B1;(y)].

To see this let g(x) =

Now g(O) =

E[B(y)].

We seek a solution, ,

and h(0) = (1—T)E[y] > 0. However, for

to

> 0

g(M+c) = M+c > h(M+c). Thus there is at least one solution to (3). There
is only one since g'(x) = 1 and h'(x) =

t[1—F(x)]

< 1.

Proposition: Let i- be the solution to (3); then BT;(.) is the r—admissible

tax system which minimizes y where y is defined in (2).
The proof is a consequence of the following simple result.

Lemma: For any z in the support of y, B(.) is the T—admissible tax system
which minimizes
E[B(y)]

We show that B

Clearly the 'r—admissible tax system which does not tax income < z and taxes

all income > z at rate t minimizes R2. Such a system minimizes the numerator
of

while it maximizes the denominator. Consider the problem of finding a

t—admissible tax system which minimizes R1. We need only concern ourseif with

how income is taxed on the interval [0, z]. The numerator of

is

(proportional to) expected after tax income when income is distributed on [0,
z]; the denominator of

is after tax income on income of z. Any progressive

tax system will decrease the denominator of R1 proportionately at least as
much as it decreases the numerator, for under a progressive system a person
with income less than z is taxed no more heavily than a person with income z.
Thus the progressive tax systems which minimize R1 are linear over the range

[0, zJ. Since B(.) is linear over [0, z] it is i—admissible and minimizes
both R1 and R2.

(4)

T = (l-R)/[(1-((1og R -

where 4(.) is the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal random
variable. To derive (4) observe first that if B(.) is the tax system which
minimizes R and if y is distributed with density f(s) and cumulative distri-

FOOTNOTES

1As Gary Chamberlain has pointed out to us, our analysis does not depend

being subjectively uncertain. It could represent known variations in

on £

earnings which will occur as an individual ages and his value in the labor
market changes. The analysis we give below applies to these predictable

changes ——with certain obvious changes to deal with discounting. (See

Rothschild (1969)). However, to simplify our exposition we shall refer to all
variability as risk.
2

Those familiar with Atkinson's (1970) work on the measurement of inequality will

note that y is the same as his equally—distributed equivalent: our R is equal
to 1—I where I is his measure of inequality.

3An obvious analogous result applies to regressive tax systems. In the
next section we note that in fact non—concave kinks (regressive portions of the
tax and transfer system) are as important in driving R away from unity as are

4Mirer (1974) presents some similar estimates over a three—year period. We
use Gottschalk's because they come from direct calculations of each individual's
standard deviations of earnings, whereas Mirer's come from the variances of

regression error terms. As the disccusion in footnote 1 above indicates, both
calculations underestimate variability since they disregard predictable
growth of income.

Gary Chamberlain has pointed out to us that there are difficulties in
inferring from panel data that the variance of income differs for people

according to their average income. A complete model would explain how
variables such as education and age determine average income, as well as the
variability of income.

19

5Some

states

offer AFDC benefits to such families, but only if the male is

unemployed. Participation rates in the program are consequently low. Such
families can receive Food Stamps, however, but the cash equivalent values are
inconsequential relative to AFDC.

(forthcoming) and others have shown that the effective tax rate

in the AFDC program is considerably lower than this. We also calculated our
R values for these lower tax rates, but we do not present the results because

their qualitative nature is the same as those here. The convex kink merely
occurs at a higher income level.

7We would like to note at this point that the lognormal assigns a zero
probability to non—work, possibly an undesirable feature when studying a

transfer program. To see its effects we also simulated and made our calculations

with a displaced log—normal with 20 percent of the distribution

negative

(i.e., a one—fifth chance of being unemployed). The resulting R

ratios were all in the same range as those in Table 2.

8The case of a "notch" —— where benefits are discontinuously reduced to
zero and the marginal tax rate i.s over 100 percent ——

Is

even more concave

The R ratios would be even smaller in this case.

9Since the EITC can be received only by families with dependents, we
assume that the aged do not receive it.
