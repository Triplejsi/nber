ABSTRACT
The future of the U.S. current account

and thus of the U.S. dollar

depend on whether foreign

investors will continue to add U.S. assets to their investment portfolios. However, even under
optimistic scenarios, the U.S. current account deficit is likely to go through a significant reversal at
some point in time. This adjustment may be as large of 4% to 5% of GDP. In order to have an idea
of the possible consequences of this type of adjustment, I have analyzed the international evidence
on current account reversals using both non-parametric techniques as well as panel regressions. The
results from this empirical investigation indicate that major current account reversals have tended
to result in large declines in GDP growth. I also analyze the large U.S. current account adjustment
of 1987-1991.

Introduction
When Alan Greenspan was appointed Chairman of the Federal Reserve in 1987,

the United States was running a current account deficit of 3.4% of GDP. This was
considered to be very large figure at the time. During the next three years the current
account deficit declined substantially, and by fourth quarter of 2004 it had shrunk to 1%
of GDP. In 1991, and partially due to foreign contributions to the financing of the Gulf
War, the United States posted a current account surplus of 0.7% of GDP. By the second
quarter of 1992 the current account was again in deficit. Since then the deficit has grown
steadily to its current level of approximately 6% of GDP.
A number of analysts have become increasingly alarmed by this very large and
growing external imbalance. Some authors have argued that by relying on foreign central
banks’ purchases of government securities, the U.S. has become vulnerable to changes in
expectations and economic sentiments. If capital flowing into the U.S. were to stop
suddenly, it is argued, there would be a large depreciation of the dollar and, as a
consequence, higher inflationary pressures. This would force the Federal Reserve to act
decisively, hiking the Federal Funds rate significantly.1 This, the story goes, would result
in a recession in the U.S. and in a slowdown of the world economy.2 The belief that a
significant external adjustment and a large decline in the dollar are unavoidable is based
on reasoning along the following lines: At approximately 6% of GDP the U.S. current
account deficit is clearly unsustainable; thus, in the next few years the deficit has to be
cut approximately in half. In a recent paper, Mussa has said:
“[T]here is probably a practical upper limit for the US net external liabilities at
something less than 100 percent of US GDP and, accordingly...current account
deficits of 5 percent or more of US GDP are not indefinitely sustainable.” (Mussa
2004, p 114).
From a policy and empirical points of view, an important question is whether
these developments – a significant real depreciation, higher interest rates and a sharp

decline in GDP growth -- are indeed necessary outcomes of a current account reversal of
the type many analysts forecast for the U.S. during the next few years. In principle, the
real consequences of a current account reversal will depend on a number of factors,
including whether the reversal is abrupt or gradual, whether the country is large or small,
and whether the country is open to the rest of the world. According to standard theory,
gradual reductions in the current account deficit do not have to be costly. In addition,
current account adjustments in large and very open countries are expected to have
different consequences than in smaller and more closed economies.
The purpose of this paper is to analyze the international evidence on current
account reversals during the period 1971-2001. Although the U.S. case is unique, an
analysis of the international experience will provide some light on the likely nature of a
future U.S. current account adjustment. In particular, this research will provide
information on whether a significant current account reversal would entail a decline in
growth and, thus, an increase in unemployment.3 Previous studies on the (real)
consequences of current account reversals have generated conflicting results: after
analyzing the evidence from a large number of countries, Milesi-Ferreti and Razin (2000)
concluded that major current account reversals have not been costly. According to them,
“reversals… are not systematically associated with a growth slowdown (p. 303).”
Frankel and Cavallo (2004), on the other hand, concluded that sudden stops of capital
inflows (a phenomenon closely related to reversals) have resulted in growth slowdown.4
In this paper I analyze several aspects of current account reversals, including:5
•

The incidence of current account reversals in different regions and groups
of countries.

•

3

The relationship between reversals and “sudden stops” of capital inflows.

Parts of this paper draw partially on my previous research on the current account and external
adjustment. The results reported here however, differ from previous analyses in several respects, including
the data set, the definition of “reversal,” the emphasis on large and industrial countries and the statistical
techniques used.

5
In Edwards (2004) I used a smaller data set to investigate reversals in emerging countries. In Edwards
(2005a) I included the case of industrial countries. However, I did not analyze whether the magnitude and
speed of the reversal affected the nature of the associated costs.

•

The relation between current account reversals and exchange rate
depreciation.

•

The relation between current account reversals and interest rates.

•

The relation between current account reversals and inflation.

•

The factors determining the probability of a country experiencing a current
account reversal.

•

The costs – in terms of growth slowdown – of current account reversals.

In analyzing these issues I have relied on two complementary statistical
approaches: First, I use non-parametric tests to analyze the incidence and main
characteristics of current account reversals. And second, I use panel regression-based
analyses to estimate the probability of experiencing a current account reversal, and the
cost of such reversal in terms of (short-term) declines in GDP growth. Although the data
set covers all regions in the world, throughout most of the paper I emphasize the
experiences of large countries and industrial countries.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In section II I provide some
background information on the U.S. current account. The analysis deals both with
historical trends, as well as with recent developments. I show that there are no modern
historical precedents of a large country, such as the United States, running persistent and
very large current account deficits. In Section III I use a cross-country data set to analyze
the international evidence on current account reversals. I use non-parametric tests to
analyze the behavior of interest rates, exchange rates, terms of trade, and economic
growth in the period following a current account reversal. I use two alternative
definitions of reversals, and I investigate whether the speed of the adjustment matters. In
Section IV I use panel regression techniques to investigate two important issues: (a) what
determines the probability that a country will experience a reversal; and (b) whether
countries that have experienced reversals have faced real costs in the form of a decline in
the rate of GDP growth. In this analysis I explicitly deal with potential endogeneity
problems by estimating an instrumental variables version of a treatment regression. In
Section V I discuss the U.S. current account adjustment of 1987-1991. Although this
episode does not qualify as a “reversal,” as defined in this paper, it is the closest the U.S.

4
has been to a major current account reduction in modern times. Finally, in Section VI I
present some concluding remarks. The paper also has a statistical appendix.
II.

The U.S. Current Account Imbalance: An Unprecedented Story
In this section I provide some background information on the evolution of the

U.S. current account during the last thirty years. The analysis is divided in three parts:
First, I deal with long-term trends and I discuss briefly the relation between the current
account and the real exchange rate. Second, I focus on the more recent period, and I
discuss the evolution and funding of the current account and its components during the
last few years. Finally, I take a comparative perspective, and I compare the recent
evolution of the U.S. current account and net international investment position with that
of other countries. I show that no other large country in modern times has run a
persistently large current account deficit of a magnitude (measured as percentage of
GDP) similar to that posted by the U.S. This lack of other historical cases makes the
analysis of the current U.S. situation particularly interesting and difficult.
II.1 A Long Run Perspective
In Figure 1 I present quarterly data for the U.S. current account balance as
percentage of GDP, for the period 1973-2004.6 I also include data on the evolution of the
Federal Reserve’s trade-weighted index of the U.S. dollar real exchange rate (an increase
in the RER index represents a real exchange rate appreciation).7 Several interesting
features emerge from this figure:
•

First, it shows that deficits have become increasingly large since 1992.

•

Second, Figure 1 shows that for the first decade of floating exchange rates
(1973-1982), the US ran, on average, a small current account surplus of
0.04% of GDP. In contrast, for the period 1983-2004 the mean current
account balance has been a deficit of 2.4% of GDP.

•

Figure 1 also shows that during the period under consideration the RER
index experienced significant gyrations.

6
7

Parts of this section draw on Edwards (2005a).
This is the Federal Reserve RER index.

5
•

Finally, Figure 1 shows a pattern of negative correlation between the
trade-weighted real value of the dollar and the current account balance.
Periods of strong dollar have tended to coincide with periods of (larger)
current account deficits. Although the relation is not one-to-one, the
degree of synchronicity between the two variables is quite high: the
contemporaneous coefficient of correlation between the (log of the) RER
index and the current account balance is –0.53; the highest correlation of
coefficient is obtained when the log of the RER is lagged three quarters (0.60).

In Figure 2 I disaggregate the data on the current account into four categories: (a)
the balance of trade of goods and services as a percentage of GDP; (b) the balance of
trade in (non financial) services as a percentage of GDP; (c) the income account, also as a
percentage of GDP; and (d) the transfers account as a percentage of GDP. As may be
seen in Panel A, large and persistent trade deficits preceded in time the era of large
current account deficits. Already in the late 1970s, the trade account was negative, and
since mid 1976 it has had only one surplus quarter (1992Q2).8 Panel B shows that since
1996 the surplus in (non-financial) services has declined steadily; in 2004 it was only 0.3
percent of GDP. As Panel C shows, the income account has been positive throughout
the 1973-2004 period. To some extent, this is surprising, since for quite some years now
the U.S. international investment position has been negative (that is, the U.S. has been a
net debtor). The reason for the positive income account is that the return on U.S. assets
held by foreigners has systematically been lower than the return on foreign assets in
hands of U.S. nationals. Finally, Panel D shows that, with the exception of one quarter,
the transfers account has been negative since 1973; during the last few years it has been
stable at approximately 0.7% of GDP.
II.2 Recent Imbalances
In Table 1 I present data on the current account as a percentage of GDP, and its
financing for the period 1990-2004. As may be seen, during the last few years the nature
of external financing has changed significantly. Since 2002 net FDI flows have been

Mann (2004) shows that most of the U.S. trade deficit is explained by a deficit in automobiles and
consumer goods.

6
negative; this contrasts with the 1997-2001 period when FDI flow contributed in an
important way to deficit financing. Also, after four years on net positive equity flows
(1998-2002), these became negative in 2003-04. As the figures in Table 1 show, during
2003 and 2004 the U.S. current account deficit was fully financed through net fixed
income flows, and in particular through official foreign purchases of government
securities.9
In Figure 3 I present the evolution of the U.S. NIIP as percentage of GDP. As
may be seen, this has become increasingly negative: in 2004 U.S. net international
liabilities reached 29 percent of GDP. An important feature of the NIIP is that gross U.S.
international assets and gross U.S. international liabilities are held in different currencies.
While more than 70% of gross foreign assets held by U.S. nationals are denominated in
foreign currency, approximately 95% of gross U.S. liabilities in hands of foreigners are
denominated in U.S. dollars. This means that net liabilities as a percentage of GDP are
subject to “valuation effects” stemming from changes in the value of the dollar. Dollar
depreciation reduces the value of net liabilities; a dollar appreciation, on the other hand,
increases the dollar value of U.S. net liabilities. Because of this valuation effect, the
deterioration of the U.S. NIIP during 2002-2004 was significantly smaller than the
accumulated current account deficit during those two years; see Table 2 for details.
An important policy question refers to the “reasonable” long run equilibrium
value of the ratio of U.S. net international liabilities to GDP; the higher this ratio, the
higher will be the “sustainable” current account deficit. According to some authors, the
current ratio of almost 30% of GDP is excessive, while others believe that a NIIP to GDP
ratio of up to 50% would be reasonable.10
From an accounting point of view, the current account is the difference between
savings and investment. A number of authors have argued that a worsening of a current
account balance that stems from an increase in investment is very different from one that
results from a decline in national savings. Some have gone as far as arguing that very
large deficits in the current account “don’t matter,” as long as they are the result of higher
(private sector) investment (Corden, 1994). Figure 4 shows that the recent deterioration

recovery is a very dangerous game,” (page 15).

See Obstfeld and Rogoff (2004) and Mussa (2004).

7
of the U.S. current account has largely been the result of a decline in national savings,
and in particular of public and household savings. Some analysts have argued that the
recent decline in U.S. savings has been, at least partially, the result of the Fed’s policy of
(very) low interest rates. According to this view, low interest rates have helped fuel very
rapid increases in housing prices and a concomitant process of “mortgage extraction.”
This has resulted in a decline in household savings to historically low levels. This, plus
the decline in government savings, is behind the increase in the current account deficit.11
A simple implication of this trend – and one that is emphasized by most authors –
is that an improvement in the U.S. current account situation will not only imply a RER
adjustment; it will also require an increase in the national savings ratio, and in particular
in household savings. Symmetrically, a correction of current global imbalances will also
require a decline in Europe’s and Japan’s savings rates and/or an increase in their
investment rates.12
II.3 The U.S. Current Account Deficit in International Perspective
In Table 3 I present data on the distribution of current account balances in the
world economy, as well as in six groups of nations – Industrial, Latin America, Asia,
Middle East, Africa and Eastern Europe – for the period 1970-2001. As may be seen, at
almost 6% of GDP the U.S. deficit is very large from a historical and comparative
perspective. It is in the top decile of deficits distribution for all industrial countries in the
first thirty years of floating. As the data in Table 3 suggest the U.S. looks more like a
Latin American or Asian country, than like an industrial nation.
Since 1970 the U.S. has been the only large industrial country that has run current
account deficits in excess of 5%. This reflects the unique position that the U.S. has in the
international financial system, where its assets have been in high demand, allowing it to
run high and persistent deficits. On the other hand, this fact also suggests that the U.S. is
moving into uncharted waters. As Obstfeld and Rogoff (2004, 2005), among others, have
pointed out, if the deficit continues at its current level, in twenty five years the U.S. net
international liabilities will surpass the levels observed by any country in modern times.

11

Stephen Roach from Morgan Stanley has been a forceful supporter of this view.
That is, the global “savings glut” identified by Bernanke (2005) would have to be reversed. See also the
Chairman’s Greenspan’s Speech to the International Monetary Conference in Beijing, June 6, 2005.
12

8
During the last 30 years only small industrial countries have had current account
deficits in excess of 5% of GDP: Australia, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Iceland,
Ireland, Malta, New Zealand, Norway and Portugal. What is even more striking is that
very few countries – either industrial or emerging -- have had persistently high current
account deficits for more than five years. In Table 4 I present a list of countries with
persistently high current account deficits for 1970-2001. In constructing this table I
define a country as having a “High Deficit” if, in a particular year, its current account
deficit is in its region’s tenth decile.13 I then defined a persistently high deficit country,
as a country with a “High Deficit” (as defined above) for at least 5 consecutive years.14
As may be seen in Table 4 the list of persistently high deficit countries is extremely short,
and none of these countries is large. This illustrates the fact that, historically, periods of
high current account imbalances have tended to be short lived, and have been followed
by periods of current account adjustments.
In Table 5 I present data on net international liabilities as a percentage of GDP for
a group of advanced countries that have historically had a large negative NIIP position.15
As may be seen, the picture that emerges from this table is quite different than that in
Table 4 on current account deficits. Indeed, a number of advanced nations have had –
and continue to have – a significantly larger net international liabilities position than the
U.S. This suggests that, at least in principle, the U.S. NIIP could continue to deteriorate
for some time into the future. However, even if this does happen, at some point this
process would have to end, and the U.S. net international liabilities position as percentage
of GDP would have to stabilize. It makes a big difference, however, at what level U.S.
net international liabilities do stabilize. For example, if in the steady state foreigners are
willing to hold the equivalent of 35% of U.S. GDP in the form of net U.S. assets, the U.S.
could sustain a current account deficit of (only) 2.1% of GDP.16 If, on the other hand,

13

Notice that the thresholds for defining High deficits are year and region-specific. That is, for every year
there is a different threshold for each region.
14
For an econometric analysis of current account deficits persistence see Edwards (2004). See also
Taylor (2002).
15
For the U.S. the data are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. For the other countries the data are,
until 1997, from the Lane and Milessi-Ferreti (2001) data set. I have updated them using current account
balance data. Notice that the updated figures should be interpreted with a grain of salt, as I have not
corrected them for valuation effects.
16
This calculation assumes a 6% rate of growth of nominal GDP going forward.

9
foreigners’ net demand for U.S. assets grows to 60% of GDP – which, as shown in Table
5, is approximately the level of (net) foreign holdings of Australian assets --, the U.S.
sustainable current account deficit would be 3.6% of GDP. Moreover, if foreigners’ are
willing to hold (net) U.S. assets for the equivalent of 100% of GDP – a figure that Mussa
(2004) considers implausible – the sustainable U.S. current account deficit can be as high
as 6% of GDP – approximately its current level. Since there are no historical precedents
for a large advanced nation running persistently large deficits, it is extremely difficult to
have a clear idea on what will be the actual evolution of foreigners’ demand for U.S.
assets.
It is worth noting that an analysis for a longer period of time confirms the view
that the recent magnitude of the current account deficit has no historical precedent in the
United States. According to Backus and Lambert (2005) the U.S. ran a current account
deficit of 5% of GDP in 1815, and a somewhat smaller but persistent deficit during the
1830s and 1870s. Greenspan (2004, p. 6) has pointed out that the large deficits during
the 19th century were financed with capital flows related to “specific major development
projects (such as railroads).”
III.

On Current Account Reversals: An International Comparative Analysis
Most recent analyses have concluded that the current level of the U.S. current

account deficit is unsustainable in the long-run. Even under an optimistic scenario,
where foreigners’ demand for U.S. securities doubles from its current level, there would
have to be a significant decline in the deficit. For example, if the (negative) NIIP were to
go from its current level of 30% of GDP to 60% of GDP, the sustainable current account
deficit would be 3.6%. This is almost three percentage points below its current level. In
reality, however, the adjustment is likely to be even larger. The reason for this is that in
order for the NIIP to go from -30% to -60% of GDP in a reasonable period of time the
current account deficit needs to overshoot its steady state level by a significant margin.
In Edwards (2005a) I present a model where the NIIP reaches 60% of GDP after 7 years;
in this case, the current account deficit continues to increase, until it reaches a peak of
7.1% of GDP. It then declines until it converges to 3.6% of GDP. According to this
work, and other recent models summarized in Table 6, at some point in time the U.S. will

10
undergo a significant current account adjustment. Although no one seems to know when
this adjustment will actually take place, almost every analyst agrees that it will have to
take place.
A key question is what will be the nature of this adjustment process? In this
Section I address this issue by analyzing the international experience with current account
reversals in the period 1970-2001. Although the U.S. case is unique – both because of
the size of its economy and because the dollar is the main vehicle currency in the world –,
an analysis of the international experience will provide some light on the likely nature of
the adjustment. A particularly important question is whether this adjustment will entail
real costs in the form of lower growth and higher unemployment.
In Table 7 I present a summary of previous studies on the real consequences of
current account reversals and “sudden stops” in capital inflows (a phenomenon closely
related to reversals). As may be seen, these studies have used different samples, different
time periods, and slightly different definitions of reversals. These studies have also
reached different results: for instance, after analyzing the evidence from a large number
of countries, Milesi-Ferreti and Razin (2000) concluded that major current account
reversals have not been costly. According to them, “reversals… are not systematically
associated with a growth slowdown (p. 303).” Frankel and Cavallo (2004) concluded
that sudden stops of capital inflows (a phenomenon closely related to reversals) have
resulted in growth slowdown, while Crocke, Kamin and Leduc (2005) argue that there is
no evidence suggesting that reversals have historically been associated with growth
slowdown (see Table 7 for details).17
In this section I analyze several aspects of current account reversals, including:18
•

The incidence of current account reversals in different regions and groups
of countries.

•

17

The relationship between reversals and “sudden stops” of capital inflows.

It should be noted that the study by Crocke et al (2005), as well as those by Debelle and Galalti (2005)
and Freund and Warnok (2005) have used a rather mild definition of reversal, consisting of a reduction in
the current account deficit of 2% of GDP in one year
18
In Edwards (2004) I used a smaller data set to investigate reversals in emerging countries. In that paper,
however, I did not consider the experience of large or industrial countries with reversals. Also, in that
paper I used very simple framework for analyzing growth. In contrast, in this section I use a two steps
dynamic of growth approach.

11
•

The relation between current account reversals and exchange rate
depreciation.

•

The relation between current account reversals and interest rates.

•

The relation between current account reversals and inflation.

•

The factors determining the probability of a country experiencing a current
account reversal.

•

The costs – in terms of growth slowdown – of current account reversals.

In analyzing these issues I rely on two complementary statistical approaches:
First, I use non-parametric tests to analyze the incidence and main characteristics of
current account reversals. And second, I use panel regression-based analyses to estimate
the probability of experiencing a current account reversal, and the cost of such reversal,
in terms of short-term declines in output growth. Although the data set covers all regions
in the world, in the discussion presented in this section, and in an effort to shed light on
the U.S. case, I emphasize the experience of large countries and industrial countries.
III.1 Current Account Reversals during 1970-2001: The International Evidence
I consider two definitions of current account reversals: (a) The first one considers
a reduction in the current account deficit of at least 4% of GDP in a one year period, and
an accumulated reduction of at least 5% of GDP in three years. This definition is called
“Reversal 4%.” (b) The second definition considers a reduction in the current account
deficit of at least 2% of GDP in one year, with an accumulated reduction in three years of
5% of GDP. This definition is called “Reversal 2%.”19 In the “Reversal 4%” definition,
the adjustment is front loaded, while in the first one it is more evenly distributed through
time. In Figure 5 I present data on the number of reversals by country group for the years
1971-2001.
In Table 8 I present data on the incidence for both definitions of current account
reversals for the complete sample as well as for six groups of countries. As may be seen,
for the overall sample the incidence of reversals is 6.5% and 9.4%, for “Reversals 4%”
and “Reversal 2%”, respectively. The incidence of reversals among the industrial
19

In both cases the timing of the reversal is recorded as the year when the episode begins. Also, for a
particular episode to classify as a current account deficit reversal, the initial balance has to be indeed a
deficit.

12
countries is much smaller however, at 1.3% and 3.3% for “Reversals 4%” and “Reversal
2%”. The Pearson-

2

and F-tests reported in Table 8 indicate that the hypothesis of

equal incidence of reversals across regions is rejected strongly.
The advanced countries that have experienced current account Reversals 4% are:
•

Greece (1986),

•

Italy (1975),

•

Malta (1997)

•

New Zealand (1975),

•

Norway (1978, 1989),

•

Portugal (1982, 1983, 1985).

The industrial (or advanced) countries that have experienced current account
Reversals 2% are:
•

Denmark (1997)

•

Finland (1976, 1977, 1993, 1994),

•

Greece (1986),

•

Iceland (1993)

•

Ireland (1982),

•

Italy (1975),

•

Malta (1997)

•

New Zealand (1976, 1986, 1988),

•

Norway (1978, 1979, 1980, 1989),

•

Portugal (1977, 1978, 1982,1984, 1985, 1986),

•

Spain (1977),

•

Sweden (1994).

With the exception of Italy, all of these countries are very small indeed; this
underlies the point that there are no historical precedents of large countries undergoing
profound current account adjustments. As pointed out above, this implies that the results
reported in this paper on current account reversals should be interpreted with a grain of
salt, and should not be mechanically extended to the case of the U.S.

13
The data analysis presented above has distinguished countries by their stage of
development and geographical location. An alternative way of dividing the sample – and
one that is particularly relevant for the discussion of possible lessons for the U.S. – is by
country size. I define “large countries” as those having a GDP in the top 25% of the
distribution in 1995 (according to this criterion there are 44 “large” countries in the
sample). The incidence of “Reversals 4%” among “large” countries is 3.9% for 19712001; the incidence of “Reversals 2%” among “large” countries is 6.3%.
III.2 Current Account Reversals and Sudden Stops of Capital Inflows
Since the mid-1990s a number of authors have analyzed episodes of sudden stops
of capital inflows.20 Although from an analytical perspective sudden stops and current
account reversals are closely related, there is no reason for this relationship to be one-toone. If there are changes in international reserves, it is perfectly possible that a country
that suffers a sudden stop does not experience, at the same time, a current account
reversal. In countries with floating exchange rates, however, changes in international
reserves tend to be relatively small, and the relation between sudden stops and reversals
should be stronger.
I defined a “sudden stop” episode as an abrupt and major reduction in capital
inflows to a country that up to that time had been receiving large volumes of foreign
capital. More specifically, an episode is defined as a “sudden stop” if the following two
conditions are met: (1) the country in question must have received an inflow of capital
(relative to GDP) larger than its region’s third quartile during the two years prior to the
“sudden stop.” And (2), net capital inflows must have declined by at least 5% of GDP in
one year.21
In Table 9 I present a data on the incidence of “sudden stops” and current account
reversals (I use both definitions of reversal), for three samples: (a) large countries,
defined as those countries that whose GDP is in the top quartile of the distribution; (b)
industrial countries; and (c) the complete sample. Table 9 shows that for the complete
sample, 37.7% of countries subject to a sudden stop also faced a “Reversal 4%” current
20

For recent papers, see Calvo et al (2004) and Frankel and Cavallo (2004). For capital flows and crises,
see Eichengreen (2003).
21
In order to check for the robustness of the results, I also used two alternative definitions of sudden stops,
which considered a reduction in inflows of 3 and 7 of GDP in one year. Due to space considerations,
however, I don’t report detailed results using these definitions.

14
account reversal. At the same time, 34.9% of those with “Reversals 4%” also
experienced (in the same year) a sudden stop of capital inflows. Panel C also shows that
45.0% of countries subject to a sudden stop faced a “Reversal 4%” current account
reversal. Also, 30.5% of those with Reversals 2% experienced (in the same year) a
sudden stop of capital inflows. The

2

tests reported in Table 9 indicate that for all

countries in the sample the hypothesis of independence between reversals and sudden
stops is rejected. The results for industrial and large countries are quite similar. For both
samples the

2

test indicates that the null hypothesis of independence between the two

phenomena cannot be rejected. An analysis of the lead-lag structure of reversals and
sudden stops suggest that sudden stops tend to occur either before or at the same time –
that is, during the same year – as current account reversals. Indeed, according to a series
of non-parametric

2

tests it is possible to reject the hypothesis that current account

reversals precede sudden stops.
III.3 Current Account Reversals and Exchange Rates
An important policy question – and one that is particularly relevant within the
context of current policy debate in the U.S. – is whether current account reversals have
historically been associated with large exchange rate depreciations.22 In Figure 6 I present
the evolution of the median nominal exchange rate (with respect to the US dollar) in
reversal countries. These data are presented as an index with a value of 100 the year of
the reversal. The data are centered on the year of the reversal; they go from three years
prior to the current account reversal to three years after the reversals. In this Figure a
lower value of the index reflects a nominal depreciation. As may be seen, in all three
samples – “large,” “industrial” and “all” countries – there is a nominal depreciation in the
period surrounding the reversal. These depreciations range from 14% to 40%, depending
on sample and the definition of reversal. In most emerging countries a large depreciation
tends to have a short run contractionary effect on GDP growth. The reason for this is that
in most of these countries many debts are expressed in foreign currency. Thus, currency
depreciation tends to have a “balance sheet” effect, increasing the domestic currency
value of these debts.23
22
23

For the relationship between depreciations and crises see Eichengreen et al (1996).
See Adalet and Eichengreen (2005).

15
Figure 7 shows the behavior of the (median) real effective exchange rate index.
As before, a decline in the index is a real depreciation. As may be seen, for the “large
countries” sample, there is a real exchange rate depreciation the year of the reversal, with
respect to the year before the adjustment. Moreover, for this sample of large countries
the RER continues to depreciate during the next three years. The accumulated (median)
RER depreciation between years -1 and +3 is 8.7% for the “Reversal 4%” definition of
reversal; it is 11.8% for “Reversal 2%”. Figure 6 also shows that there is a RER
depreciation in the “industrial countries” sample. In this case, however, there is an
overshooting, and the maximum depreciation is achieved one year after the reversal – it is
7.2% for Reversal 4% and 5.2% for Reversal 2% episodes. Finally, the last panel in
Figure 6 shows that for the “all countries” sample there are no significant changes in
(median) RER behavior in the +/- 3 years that surround a current account reversal.
For comparison purposes, and in order to gain further insights, I constructed a
dataset for a “control group” of countries that have not experienced a current account
reversal. I then computed a battery of χ2 tests for the equality of distributions (KruskalWallis tests) between the reversal countries and the control group.24 The results from
these tests are presented in Table 10 (p-values in parentheses).25 As may be seen, these
χ2 tests show that nominal exchange rates have behave differently in the reversal
countries and in the control group countries – this is the case independently of the
reversal group one looks at. They also show that, for the large countries sample, RERs
have behaved differently in the reversal and control group countries.
The exchange rate adjustments in the reversal countries reported in Figures 6 and
7 are relatively small when compared with the “required” exchange rate depreciation that
has been calculated in a number of studies, including those summarized in Table 6.
Obstfeld and Rogoff (2004), for example, estimate that eliminating the U.S. current
account deficit would imply a (real) depreciation of between 16 and 36 percent.
Blanchard, Giavazzi and Sa (2005) have estimated a required depreciation of the U.S.
trade weighted dollar in the order of 40%. There are many possible reasons for these
24

The tests are performed on the changes in the variables of interest, during two time spans: between 3
years before and 3 years after the reversals, and between one year before and the year of the reversal. Three
different control groups were constructed; one for each sample.
25
These 2 tests refer to accumulated exchange rate changes in the -3 to +3 year period surrounding a
reversal.

16
differences, including that the U.S. is a very large country, while the countries that have
experienced reversals are much smaller. Also, the values of elasticities and other
parameters may be different in the U.S. than in the average reversal country. Yet another
possibility has to do with the level of economic activity and aggregate demand. Most
recent models on the U.S. current account assume that the economy stays in a “full
employment” path. It is possible, however, that the countries that have historically
experienced reversals have also gone through economic slowdowns, and that a reduction
in aggregate demand contributed to the adjustment effort.
III.4

Current Account Reversals, Interest Rates and Inflation
A number of analysts have argued that one of the most serious consequences of a

rapid current account reversal (and the concomitant nominal depreciation) is its effect on
inflationary pressures and inflation. I this section I investigate this issue by analyzing the
behavior of inflation and nominal (lending) interest rates in the period surrounding
reversal episodes.26 Figure 8 depicts data on (median) inflation rates for the three
reversal samples; Figure 9, on the other hand, has data on nominal interest rates. As may
be seen from Figure 8, in the “large countries” sample, there is a sharp increase in the
(median) rate of inflation the year of the reversal. Although it stabilizes somewhat,
inflation stays above its pre-reversal level for the three years after the current account
adjustment. Figure 8 also shows that there is an increase in inflation after the reversals.
In the industrial countries, however, the pattern is somewhat different from that of large
countries; also, they exhibit some differences in behavior across the two definitions of
reversals.
The data in Figure 9 on interest rates shows that in the three samples, and for both
definitions of reversal, nominal interest rates are higher three years after the reversal than
three years prior to the reversal. For the “large countries” the increase is rather gradual.
Interest rates begin to increase two years before the reversal. For “Reversal 2%” interest
rates peak one year after the crisis; for the “Reversal 4%” definition they peak three years
after, In the industrial countries, on the other hand, there are no discernible changes in
interest rates before the reversal; there is, however, a significant jump during the first
26

Gagnon (2005) analyzes behavior of interest rates behavior in the aftermath of currency crises. He does
not concentrate on reversals, however.

17
year after the crisis. Finally, the data for the “all countries” show a steady increase in
nominal interest rates in the year surrounding the reversals. Between three years prior to
a “Reversal 4%” episode and one year after the reversal, median interest rates increased
by310 basis points in large countries, 570 basis points for industrial countries and 240
basis points for all countries. Under most circumstances increases in interest rates of this
magnitude are likely to have a negative effect on aggregate demand and economic
activity. In Section IV of this paper I deal with the effects of reversals on economic
growth.
The Kruskal-Wallis tests in Table 10 indicate that, for the short time horizon,
changes in inflation are significantly higher in the reversal countries than in the control
group. These tests also show that for “large countries” changes in interest rates are
significantly different in the reversal and control groups.
III.5

The Probability of Experiencing Current Account Reversals
In order to understand further the forces behind current account reversals I

estimated a number of panel equations on the probability of experiencing a reversal. The
empirical model is given by equations (1) and (2):

(1)

(2)

ρ tj

ρ tj*

1,

if ρ tj* > 0,

0,

otherwise.

=

=

αω tj + ε tj .

Variable ρ jt is a dummy variable that takes a value of one if country j in period t
experienced a current account reversal, and zero if the country did not experience a
reversal. According to equation (2), whether the country experiences a current account
reversal is assumed to be the result of an unobserved latent variable ρ tj* . ρ tj* , in turn, is
assumed to depend linearly on vector ω tj . The error term ε tj is given by given by a
variance component model: ε tj = ν j + µ tj . ν j is iid with zero mean and variance σ ν2 ;

18

µ tj is normally distributed with zero mean and variance σ µ2 = 1 . The data set used covers
87 countries, for the 1970-2001 period; not every country has data for every year,
however. See the Data Appendix for exact data definition and data sources.
In determining the specification of this probit model I followed the literature on
external crises, and I included the following covariates:27 (a) The ratio of the current
account deficit to GDP lagged one period. (b) A sudden stop dummy that takes the value
of one if the country in question experienced a sudden stop in the previous year. (c) An
index that measures the relative occurrence of sudden stops in the country’s region
(excluding the country itself) during that particular year. This variable captures the effect
of “regional contagion.” (d) The one-year lagged gross external debt over GDP ratio.
Ideally one would want to have the net debt; however, there most countries there are no
data on net liabilities. (e) The one-year lagged rate of growth of domestic credit. (f) The
lagged ratio of the country’s fiscal deficit relative to GDP. (g) The country’s initial GDP
per capita (in logs).
The results obtained from the estimation of this variance-component probit
model for a sample of large countries are presented in Table 11; as before, I have defined
“large” as having a GDP in the top 25% of its distribution. The results obtained are quite
satisfactory; the vast majority of coefficients have the expected sign, and many of them
are significant at conventional levels.28 The results may be summarized as follows:
Larger (lagged) current account deficits increase the probability of a reversal, as does a
(lagged) sudden stop of capital inflows. Countries with higher GDP per capita have a
lower probability of a reversal. The results do not provide strong support for the
contagion hypothesis: the variable that measures the incidence of sudden stops in the
county’s region is significant in only one of the equations (its sign is always positive,
however). There is also evidence that an increase in a country’s (gross) external debt
increases the probability of reversals. Although, the U.S. is a very special case the results
reported in Table 11 provide some support to the idea that during the last few years the
probability of the U.S. experiencing a reversal has increased.
27

See, for example, Frankel and Rose (1996), Milesi-Ferreti and Razin (2000) and Edwards (2002).
Results for the other two samples of countries are quite similar; they are not reported here due to space
considerations.

IV.

Current Account Reversals and Growth

One of the most important questions regarding a (possible) current account
reversal in the United States is whether it will affect negatively economic activity and
growth. In this Section I investigate the relation between current account reversals and
real economic performance using the comparative data set presented above. I am
particularly interested in analyzing the following issues: (a) historically, have current
account adjustments had an effect on GDP growth? (b), Have the effects of reversals
depend on the structural characteristics of the country in question, including its economic
size (i.e. whether it is a large country), its degree of trade openness and the extent to
which it restricts capital mobility. And (c) have the effects of the reversals on economic
growth depended on the magnitude and speed at which the adjustment takes place. In
addressing these issues I emphasize the case of large countries; as a comparison,
however, I do provide results for the complete sample of countries.
Authors that have analyzed the real effects of current account reversals have
reached different conclusions. Milesi-Ferreti and Razin (2000), for example, used both
before–and-after analyses as well as cross-country regressions to deal with this issue and

concluded that “reversal events seem to entail substantial changes in macroeconomic
performance between the period before and the period after the crisis but are not
systematically associated with a growth slowdown (p. 303, emphasis added).” Edwards

(2002), on the other hand, used dynamic panel regression analysis and concluded that
major current account reversals had a negative effect on investment, and that they had “a
negative effect on GDP per capita growth, even after controlling for investment (p.
52).”29 Debelle and Galati (2005) used a before and after approach and concluded that
(2%) reversals did not result in a slowdown in growth, a result that was also obtained by
Croke et al (2005). Freund and Warnock (2005), on the other hand, used a multivariate
statistical approach and found that reversals have been associated with a slowdown in
economic growth. None of these studies, however, has analyzed the potential role of the
speed of adjustment on the effects of reversals on growth..
29

In a recent paper, Guidotti et al (2004) consider the role of openness in an analysis of imports and exports
behavior in the aftermath of a reversal. See also Frankel and Cavallo (2004).

20
IV.1

Preliminaries

In Figure 10 I present data on (median) GDP growth per capita in the period
surrounding current account reversals. As may be seen in this Figure, in the three
samples considered in this study there is a decline in GDP growth in the year of the
reversal. This decline is particularly pronounced in the “large countries” and “industrial
countries” samples. It is interesting to notice, however, that the drop in the rate of GDP
growth appears to be short lived. In the “large countries” and “all countries” samples
there is a very sharp recovery in growth one year after the reversal episode. KruskalWallis tests, reported in Table 10 indicate that in the reversal countries growth is
significantly lower in the years surrounding the reversals than in a control group of
counties that have not experienced a reversal (the p-values range from 0.07 to.0.00).
IV.2

Growth Effects of Current Account Reversals: An Econometric Model

The point of departure of the econometric analysis is a two-equation formulation
for the dynamics of real GDP per capita growth of country j in period t. Equation (3) is
the long run GDP growth equation; equation (4), on the other hand, captures the growth
dynamics process.
(3)

g~t = α + x j β + r jθ + ω j .

(4)

∆g jt = λ[ g~ j − g jt −1 ] + ϕv jt + γu jt + ε jt .

g~ j is the long run rate of real per capita GDP growth in country j; x j is a vector of

structural, institutional and policy variables that determine long run growth; r j is a vector
of regional dummies; α, β and θ are parameters, and ω j is an error term assumed to be
heteroskedastic. In equation (3), g jt is the rate of growth of per capita GDP in country j
in period t. The terms v jt and u jt are shocks, assumed to have zero mean, finite variance
and to be uncorrelated among them. More specifically, v jt is assumed to be an external
terms of trade shock, while u jt captures other shocks, including current account
reversals. ε jt is an error term, which is assumed to have a variance component form, and

λ, ϕ, and γ are parameters that determine the particular characteristics of the growth

21
process. Equation (4) has the form of an equilibrium correction model and states that the
actual rate of growth in period t will deviate from the long run rate of growth due to the
existence of three types of shocks: v t j, u t j and ξ t j. Over time, however, the actual rate
of growth will tend to converge towards it long run value, with the rate of convergence
given by λ. Parameter ϕ , in equation (4), is expected to be positive, indicating that an
improvement in the terms of trade will result in a (temporary) acceleration in the rate of
growth, and that negative terms of trade shock are expected to have a negative effect
on g jt .30 From the perspective of the current analysis, a key issue is whether current
account reversals have a negative effect on growth; that is, whether coefficient γ is

significantly negative. In the actual estimation of equation (4), I used dummy variables
for reversals. An important question – and one that is addressed in detail in the
Subsection that follows – is whether the effects of different shocks on growth are
different for countries with different structural characteristics, such as its degree of trade
and capital account openness.31
Equations (3) - (4) were estimated using a two-step procedure. In the first step I
estimate the long run growth equation (3) using a cross-country data set. These data are
averages for 1970-2001, and the estimation makes a correction for heteroskedasticity.
These first stage estimates are then used to generate long-run predicted growth rates to
replace g~ in the equilibrium error correction model (4). In the second step, I estimated
j

equation (4) using GLS for unbalanced panels; I used both random effects and fixed
effects estimation procedures.32 The data set used covers 157 countries, for the 19702001 period; not every country has data for every year, however. See the Data Appendix
for exact data definition and data sources.
In estimating equation (3) for long-run per capita growth, I followed the standard
literature on growth, as summarized by Barro and Sala-I-Martin (1995), Sachs and
Warner (1995) and Dollar (1992) among others. I assume that the rate of growth of GDP
( g~ ) depends on a number of structural, policy and social variables. More specifically, I
j

include the following covariates: the log of initial GDP per capita; the investment ratio;

22
the coverage of secondary education, as a proxy for human capital; an index of the degree
of openness of the economy; the ratio of government consumption relative to GDP; and
regional dummies. The results obtained from these first-step estimates are not reported
due to space considerations.
In Table 12 I present the results from the second step estimation of the growth
dynamics equation (4), when random effects were used. The results are presented for two
samples -- “large countries,” and “industrial countries” --, and for the two definitions of
reversals discussed above. The estimated coefficient of the growth gap is, as expected,
positive, significant, and smaller than one. The point estimates are on the high side -between 0.69 and 0.78 --, suggesting that, on average, deviations between long run and
actual growth get eliminated rather quickly. For instance, according to equation (12.1),
after 3 years, approximately 82% of a unitary shock to real GDP growth per capita will
be eliminated. Also, as expected, the estimated coefficients of the terms of trade shock
are always positive, and statistically significant, indicating that an improvement
(deterioration) in the terms of trade results in an acceleration (de-acceleration) in the rate
of growth of real per capita GDP. As may be seen from Table 12, in all regressions the
coefficient of the current account reversals variable is significantly negative, indicating
that reversals result in a deceleration of growth in both samples. For large countries
these results suggest that, on average, a “Reversal 4%” reversal has resulted in a
reduction of GDP growth of 5.25% in the first year. This effect persists through time,
and is eliminated gradually as g converges towards g~ . In the case of “Reversal 2%” the
j

estimated negative effect is significantly, at -4.3%. According to these results, the
negative growth effects of a “front loaded” current account reversal – that is, a “Reversal
4%”episode -- are significantly larger than those of a more gradual reversal or a

“Reversal 2%” type of episode. The results for the industrial countries sample are
reported in equations 12.3 and 12.4 in Table 12. As may be seen, the negative effect on
growth is milder than for large countries; it is still the case, however, that a “front loaded”
reversal has a more severe effect on growth than a more gradual reversal episodes.
When lagged values of the reversals indicators are added to these regressions their
coefficients turned out to be non-significant at conventional levels.

23
To summarize, the results presented in Table 12 are revealing, and provide some
light on the costs of an eventual current account reversal in the U.S. Historically, “large
countries” and “industrial countries” that have gone through reversals have experienced
deep GDP growth reductions; these reductions are higher if the current account reversal
is “front loaded.” These estimates indicate that, on average, and with other factors given,
and depending on the sample and the definition of reversal, the declined of GDP growth
per capita has been in the range of 2.2 to 5.3 percent in the first year of the adjustment.
Three years after the initial adjustment GDP growth will still be below its long run trend.
IV.2 Extensions, Endogeneity and Robustness

In this sub-section I discuss some extensions and deal with robustness issues,
including the potential endogeneity bias of the estimates. More specifically, I address the
following issues: (a) the effects of terms of trade changes; (a) the role of countries
structural characteristics in determining the costs of adjustment.
A. Terms of Trade Effects: The results in Table 12 were obtained controlling for

terms of trade changes. That is, the coefficient of the Reversal 4% and Reversal 2%
coefficients capture the effect of a current account reversal, maintaining terms of trade
constant. As discussed in Sections II, however, in large countries external adjustment is
very likely to affect the terms of trade. The exact nature of that effect will depend on a
number of factors, including the size of the relevant elasticities and the extent of home
bias in consumption. In order to have an idea of the effect of current account reversals
allowing for international price adjustments, I re-estimated equation (4) excluding the
terms of trade variable for the “large countries” sample. The estimated coefficients for
the reversals coefficients were smaller (in absolute terms) than those in Table 12,
indicating that when the terms of trade are allowed to adjust, the growth effect of the
reversal is less severe. That is, for large countries, the terms of trade adjustment
following a reversal generates offsetting forces on growth. The estimated coefficient of
the Reversal 4% is now -4.1 (it is -5.3 in Table 12). The new estimated coefficient of
Reversal 2% is now -3.6; it was -4.4 in Table 12). Interestingly, when the terms of trade

variable is excluded from the regressions for the “industrial countries” and “all countries”
samples, the coefficients of Reversal are not affected.

24
B. Openness and the Costs of Adjustment: Recent studies on the economics of

external adjustment have emphasized the role of trade openness. Edwards (2004), Calvo
et al (2004) and Frankel and Cavallo (2004), among others, have found that countries that
are more open to international trade tend to incur in a lower cost of adjustment. Most of
these studies, however, have not made a distinction between large and small countries,
nor have they distinguished between industrial and other countries. I added two
interactive regressors to equations of the type of (4). More specifically, I included the
following terms: (a) a variable that interacts the reversals indicator with trade openness;
and (b) a variable that interacts the reversal indicator with an index of the degree of
international capital mobility. Trade openness is proxied by the fitted value of the
imports plus exports to GDP ratio obtained from a gravity model of bilateral trade.33
The index on international capital mobility, on the other hand, was developed by
Edwards (2005b), and ranges from zero to 100, with higher numbers denoting a higher
degree of capital mobility. The results obtained are presented in Table 13. As may be
seen, the coefficients of the reversal indicators continue to be significantly negative, as in
the previous analysis. However, the variable that interacts trade openness and reversals is
not significant for large and industrial countries, indicating that for these two groups trade
openness has not affected the way in which reversals affect growth. However, for the
complete sample, this coefficient is significantly positive, indicating that countries that
are more open to trade have a lower cost of reversals. The coefficient for the variable
that interacts reversals with capital mobility is not significant for the “large” and
“industrial” countries sample; it is significantly negative for the “all countries sample”
(results available from the author). The results reported in Table 13, then, suggest that
the way in which structural characteristics affect adjustment are different for different
type of countries. While openness appears to be important for small non-industrial
counties, they are not important for countries that are large or advanced.
C. Endogeneity : The results discussed above were obtained using a random
effects GLS for unbalanced panels, and under the assumption that the reversal variable is
exogenous. It is possible, however, that whether a reversal takes place is affected by
33

The use of gravity trade equations to generate instruments in panel estimation has been pioneered by
Jeff Frankel. See, for example, Frankel and Cavallo (2004).

25
growth performance, and, thus, is endogenously determined. In order to deal with this
issue I have re-estimated equation (4) using an instrumental variables GLS panel
procedure. In the estimation the following instruments were used: (a) the ratio of the
current account deficit to GDP lagged one and two periods. (b) A lagged sudden stop
dummy that takes the value of one if the country in question has experienced a sudden
stop in the previous year. (c) An index that measures the relative occurrence of sudden
stops in the country’s region (excluding the country itself) during that particular year.
This variable captures the effect of “regional contagion.” (d) The one-year lagged
external gross debt over GDP ratio. (e) The ratio of net international reserves to GDP,
lagged one year. (f) The one-year lagged rate of growth of domestic credit. (g) The
country’s initial GDP per capita (in logs). The results obtained, not presented here due to
space considerations, show that the coefficients of the reversal indicators are significantly
negative, confirming that historically current account reversals have had a negative effect
on growth. The absolute values of the estimated coefficients, however, are larger than
those obtained when random effects GLS were used.
D. Alternative Indicators of Current Account Reversals: Throughout the

analysis I have used reversal indicators that constraint the current account deficit
adjustment to be at least 5% of GDP in a three-year period. As a way of gaining
additional insights into the effects of current account reversals, in Table 14 I present
results obtained when two alternative reversal indicators are used: “Reversal 14” is
defined as an episode where the current account deficit declines in at least 4% in one
year, independently of what happens in the years to come. “Reversal 12,” on the other
hand, is defined as an episode where the current account deficit declines in at least 2% in
one year, independently of whether the deficits continues to decline in the following
years. These two new variables, then, provide “less demanding” definitions of reversals.
The results in Table 14, confirm those discussed above. They show that reversals have
had a negative effect on growth in all three samples. In addition, these results indicate
that the magnitude of the reversal matters; deeper reversals (4% in one year) have a more
negative effect on growth than milder reversals (2% in one year). Also, a comparison
between the results in Tables 12 and 14 suggest that the effects on growth of sustained
reversals have a greater effect on growth.

26
E. Robustness and Other Extensions: In order to check for the robustness of the

results I also estimated several versions of equation (4) for the large countries sample. In
one of these exercises I introduced lagged values of the reversal indicators as additional
regressors. The results obtained – available on request – show that lagged values of these
indexes were not significant at conventional levels. I also varied the definition of “large
countries;” the main message of the results, however, is not affected by the sample.
V.

The U.S. Current Account Reversal of 1987-1991

Between 1987 and 1991 the U.S. current account deficit experienced a major
reversal. In the third quarter of 1987 the deficit stood at 3.7%, a figure that was then
considered to be exceptionally high. During the next three years the deficit declined
gradually, and in the fourth quarter of 1990 it was 1% of GDP. During the next two
quarters, and as a result of foreign countries’ contributions to financing of the Gulf War,
the current account briefly posted a surplus of 0.8% of GDP. The 1987-1991 adjustment
process was accompanied by a major depreciation of the U.S. dollar. The dollar began to
loose value in the second quarter of 1985, almost two years before the current account
deficit began its turnaround.34 Although this episode does not qualify as a “reversal” in
the empirical analysis presented in the preceding sections, it is the closest to a major
current account adjustment that the U.S. has experienced in modern times. In this section
I analyze the behavior of some key economic variables in the period surrounding this
adjustment.
In Figure 11 I present quarterly data for the period 1983-1993 for: (a) the current
account balance; (b) the trade-weighted real exchange rate index for the U.S. dollar; (c)
the cyclical component of real GDP; and (d) the cyclical component of the rate of
unemployment.35 In Figure 12 I present monthly data for the same period (1983-1993)
for: (i) the rate of inflation; (ii) the Federal Funds interest rate; and (c) the 10 year
Treasury Note interest rate. In both Figures I have shaded the period October 1987-June
1991, which corresponds to the actual period when the current account deficit declined.
34

This two-year lag coincides with the conventional wisdom of the time it takes a dollar depreciation to
affect the current account.
35
These cyclical components were computed using a Hodrick-Prescott filter on the complete time series
from 1951 through 2005.

27
From an analytical point of view, however, we are also interested in the behavior of these
key variables in the period immediately preceding and immediately following the
adjustment. The picture that emerges from these Figures may be summarized as follows:
•

During the adjustment process the U.S. dollar depreciated significantly in
real terms. Between the second quarter of 1985 and the second quarter of
1991 the dollar lost 30% of its value in real trade-weighted terms.
Between the third quarter of 1987 and the second quarter of 1991 – the
shaded period in Figures 11 and 12 --, the trade weighted dollar lost 9.5%
of its value.

•

During the early part of the adjustment there was no decline in GDP, nor
was there an increase in unemployment. However, during the latter part of
the adjustment – starting in the second quarter of 1990 – there was a
decline in GDP and a marked increase in unemployment. Indeed, as may
be seen from Figure 11, GDP stayed below its stochastic trend well into
1993; unemployment was above its own trend until early 1994. According
to the National Bureau of Economic Research in August of 1990 the U.S.
entered into a recession that lasted until March of 1991.36

•

During the first part of the adjustment there was a sharp increase in the
Federal Funds interest rate. In October 1986 the Federal Funds rate was
5.85%; by March 1989 it had increased by 400 basis points, to 9.85%. In
June 1989 the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points, and began a period of
interest rate reduction. By the end of the adjustment, in June 1991, the
Federal Funds rate stood at 5.9%.

•

The yield on the 10-year Treasury Note increased significantly in the
months preceding the actual current account adjustment. The yield went
from 7.1% in January 1987, to 9.4% in September of that year – an
increase of 230 basis points. From that time and until March 1989, the
yield on the 10-year Note moved between 9% and 9.4%. Starting in April
1989, long term interest rates began to fall, reaching 8% in April 1991. In
June 1993, two years after the current account adjustment had ended, the

36

I am not necessarily implying causality in this description of the data.

28
long tem interest rate was 6%. The yield curve became inverted in
January, 1989, and stayed inverted until January 1990.
•

In the period preceding the adjustment there was an increase in inflation.
This continued to exhibit an upward trend until late 199o, when it reached
6%.

Two other features of the 1987-1991 current account adjustment episode are
worth noting. First, during that period the U.S. terms of trade (prices of exports over
imports) did not experience significant changes. And second, during this adjustment
episode the actual external adjustment took place through a decline in three categories of
capital inflows: (a) foreigners’ net purchases of private securities (bonds and equities);
(b) foreign central banks net purchases of treasury securities; and (c) net bank credit.
(See Figure 13 for the composition of current account financing for the period 19801993).
The 1987-1991 current account adjustment in the U.S. was significant, but
gradual. And although the episode does not qualify as a “current account” reversal, as
defined in Section III of this paper, it does provide some useful information. As Figures
11 and 12 show, this adjustment was not characterized by a traumatic collapse in output.
However, its general pattern had many similarities with the major current account
reversals analyzed in Sections III and IV of this paper. The 1987-91 adjustment episode
in the U.S. was characterized by: (a) a steep depreciation of the U.S. dollar. (b) An
increase in inflation. (c) Higher interest rates; the Fed Funds rate increased through the
first half of the adjustment, while the 10 year rate increased in the months prior to the
beginning of the actual adjustment. (d) A decline in GDP below trend towards the latter
part of the adjustment. In fact, the U.S. entered into a recession while the adjustment was
taking place. (e) An increase in the rate of unemployment above trend, during the final
quarters of the adjustment.
VI.

Concluding Remarks

In this paper I have illustrated the uniqueness of the current U.S. external
situation. As shown in Section II, never in the history of modern economics has a large

29
industrial country run persistent current account deficits of the magnitude posted by the
U.S. since 2000. This significant increase in the U.S. current account deficit may be
explained by the increase in the international demand for U.S. securities during the last
few years.37 The future of the U.S. current account – and thus of the U.S. dollar – depend
on whether foreign investors will continue to add U.S. assets to their investment
portfolios. However, even under optimistic scenarios the U.S. current account deficit will
have to go through a significant reversal at some point in time.
In order to have an idea of the possible consequences of this type of adjustment, I
have analyzed the international evidence on current account reversals. The results from
this empirical investigation indicate that major current account reversals have tended to
result in large declines in GDP growth. Historically, “large countries” that have gone
through major reversals have experienced deep GDP growth reductions. Three years after
the initial adjustment GDP growth will still be below its long run trend. An analysis of
the U.S. current account adjustment of 1987-1991 shows that that episode many
similarities with the major current account reversals discussed in this paper.

37

This, in turn, is a manifestation of the “global savings glut.”

U.S. Current Account Adjustment and the U.S. Dollar:
Selected Studies, 1999-2005
AUTHORS
Mann (1999)

Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000)

METHODOLOGY
Model tracks U.S. NIIP through
time.

MAIN ASSUMPTIONS
Income elasticity of imports (1.7)
exceeds income elasticity of exports
(1.0).

Analyzes trajectory of NIIP under
three scenarios, and asks whether
these trajectories are sustainable.

Base case scenario assumes no RER
adjustment for the USD.

Elasticities-based adjustment
mechanism.

A USD adjustment scenario
assumes a RER depreciation of 25%.

Considers two scenarios for global
growth.

A structural adjustment scenario
assumes that exports’ elasticity
increases to 1.3.

Develops and calibrates optimizing
model of small open economy, with
two goods: tradable and nontradable.
Output is exogenous; prices are
assumed to be flexible; monetary
policy stabilizes the price level.
Analyzes the effect on RER of an
exogenous shock that results in a
reduction of the CA deficit of 4.4% of
GDP.

Elasticity of substitution between
tradables and nontradables is assumed
to be equal to one.
Assumes a 6% nominal interest rate,
and a NIIP of 20% of GDP.
Tradables output is assumed to be
25% of GDP.
Assumes that full-employment is
maintained.

MAIN RESULTS
In base case scenario the NIIP
becomes increasingly negative and
the CA is unsustainable in the
medium run.
Under RER depreciation scenario
CA is within sustainable ranges even
in a 10 year long horizon.
Under structural adjustment, CA
deficit is 3% in a 10 year horizon, if
the global economy has high
performance.
Base case result indicates that an
elimination of the CA deficit will
imply a 16% RER depreciation, and a
12% nominal depreciation of the
USD.
Assuming a share of tradables equal
to 15%, results in a RER depreciation
of 20%.
The effect on the nominal value of
the USD could be even higher if the
reduction in the CA is very rapid.

METHODOLOGY

MAIN ASSUMPTIONS

MAIN RESULTS

Analyzes the trajectory of NIIP as a
percentage of GDP.

Analyzes the rates of return obtained
by foreign owners of U.S. assets.

Argues that at the observed levels of
CA deficits, the NIIP is moving
towards the levels of Canada,
Australia and New Zealand. It is
difficult to believe that this is possible
for a large country such as the U.S.

Argues that with the exception of
FDI these rates of return have been
modest.

It is unlikely that U.S. will be able to
continue to attract foreign purchasing
for its assets at observed low rates of
return. Thus, the U.S. CA deficit is
clearly unsustainable.

Estimates “required” RER
depreciation in order to bring CA
deficit to 2% and NIIP not to surpass
40%.
Wren-Lewis (2004)

Calibrates a partial equilibrium
model to obtain set of bilateral RER
consistent with attaining certain
(exogenous) current account deficits.
No attempt is made to determine
what is the sustainable level of the
U.S. current account.
Considers the effect of a U.S. fiscal
shock and of a U.S. technological
shock.

Shows that FDI has declined
significantly as a source of financing
of the U.S. CA deficit.

A return to sustainability (2% of
GDP) will imply a depreciation of the
RER of as much as 43%.

To determine initial conditions,
author estimates “underlying” (or
cycle-adjusted) CA balances.

CA deficit of 2% of GDP is
consistent with a yen/dollar rate of 88,
and a dollar/euro of 1.18.

Considers 3 possible long term
scenarios: 1%, 2% and 3% CA deficit.

If there is a positive technological
shock, the “sustainable” CA deficit
may be higher. This would be
consistent a yen/dollar rate of 89-100,
and a dollar/euro of 1.11-1.19.

Three-good partial equilibrium
model (including a nontraded) of
small economy.
Elasticities and other parameter
values taken from regression analysis
and from OECD data set.

Estimates that if China has a CA
surplus of 1% of GDP the Rmb/USD
would be 6.71.

Benassy-Quere et al (2004)

METHODOLOGY
Estimates econometrically RER path
consistent with nontradable
equilibrium.
The RER is assumed to depend on
the country’s net foreign assets (NFA)
position and on relative productivity.

MAIN ASSUMPTIONS
Model estimated simultaneously for
15 currencies.
Data on NFA obtained from lane
and Milessi-Ferreti (2004) and
relative productivities obtained as
ratio of CPI to PPI.
No attempt is made to impose
external equilibrium condition.

Mussa (2004)

Analyzes trajectory of NIIP and
argues that it is unlikely that it will
continue to grow at current pace. If it
did it would reach 100% of GDP.
Argues that challenge is for RER
adjustment to be gradual and that it
does not disrupt growth.
Argues that fiscal adjustment in the
U.S. is necessary for smooth
correction of imbalances.
No attempt is made at calculating
the “outer limit” of U.S. NIIP.
Analyzes the RER adjustment
compatible with a gradual reduction
of the CA deficit to 2% of GDP and a
NIIP between 40% and 50%.

Results provided for two cases:
USD as numeraire and euro as
numeraire.
Based on results from large
econometric models assumes that a
1% reduction of the U.S. CA deficit is
associated with a 10% depreciation of
the RER.

MAIN RESULTS
The extent of misalignment of the
different currencies depends on how
broad is the adjustment.
Using the USD as numeraire,
estimates that in 2003 the euro was
undervalued between 1.2% and 7.6%.
Using the USD as numeraire,
estimates that in 2001 the yen was
undervalued between 14.3% and
22.1%.
Relative to its value in mid 2004,
Mussa calculates that the RER will
have to depreciate another 20% to
achieve a long term CA deficit of 2%.
Discusses policies that will assist the
adjustment process: (a) Fiscal
consolidation in the U.S. will help
keep U.S. demand growing below the
pace of output growth. (b) Monetary
policy in Europe and Japan should be
more expansive.
Concludes that “some” international
policy cooperation is likely to help the
adjustment process.

METHODOLOGY
Update of O’Neill and Hatzious
(2002) model.
Analyzes the trajectory of NIIP as a
percentage of GDP, and finds that
path is not sustainable.
Introduces the role of productivity
gains to original framework.

MAIN ASSUMPTIONS
Estimates a trade balance equation
and uses the coefficients to compute
the “required” RER depreciation to
achieve different CA adjustment
targets.
Trade equation also includes foreign
and U.S. demand growth.

Analyzes the composition of capital
flows into the U.S.
Incorporates the role of valuation
effects.
Obstfeld and Rogoff (2004)

Extension of the Obstfeld-Rogoff
(2002) model to a two-country world.
Terms of trade are now endogenous.
Incorporates the effects of valuation
effects of exchange rate changes on
NIIP.
Exercise assumes an elimination of
the CA deficit; that is a reduction in
5% of GDP.

Ratio of CA deficit to tradables is
25%; CA deficit is 5% of GDP.
Output is exogenously given in both
countries.
NIIP is 20% of GDP.
Home country produces 22% of
world tradables.
Simulation is done for alternative
values of elasticities, and under
different assumptions regarding
changes in tradables output and
military spending.

MAIN RESULTS
A reduction of the CA deficit to 3%
would imply RER depreciation of the
order of 21.6% to 23.6%.
A reduction of the CA deficit to 2%
would imply RER depreciation of the
order of 32.1% to 34.1%.
An elimination of the CA deficit to
2% would imply RER depreciation of
the order of 53% to 55%. (Notice that
these figures are significantly higher
than those estimated by Obstfeld and
Rogoff, 2004).

Assuming constant output, an
elimination of the CA deficit implies
RER depreciation between 14.7% and
33.6%.
If tradables output increases by
20%, the RER depreciation ranges
from 9.8% to 22.5%.
If there is a permanent increase in
military expenditure, the RER
depreciation ranges from 16.0% to
36.1%.

METHODOLOGY

MAIN ASSUMPTIONS

Uses macro aggregate model to
project the U.S. current account.

First scenario considers a constant
RER dollar.

In first scenario, CA deficit 13% of
GDP in 2012.

Imposes exogenous assumptions on
RER, and analyzes CA path

Second scenario considers a constant
trade deficit at 5% of GDP, and a
RER depreciation of approximately
7%.

In second scenario, CA deficit 9% of
GDP in 2012.

Third scenario considers a faster rate
of growth of exports, and substantial
(50%) depreciation. This scenario
also assumes a gradual elimination
(by 2012) of the fiscal deficit.
Blanchard, Giavazzi, Sa (2005)

MAIN RESULTS

Uses portfolio model to analyze
U.S. current account behavior.
Assumes changes in portfolio
preferences in world economy.

Considers dynamics of adjustment.
Considers valuation effects of
changes in the U.S. dollar.
Simulates model under certain
assumptions for values of key
parameters (elasticities, portfolio
shares and other).
The question asked is: what is the
required (real) depreciation of the
U.S. dollar to eliminate the current
account deficit?

In third scenario, the NIIP stabilizes
at approximately 55% of GDP, and
the CA deficit declines gradually,
reaching 4.3% of GDP in 2012.

Estimates range of required U.S.
dollar real depreciation (today). After
incorporating the role of valuation
effects the range is estimated to be
between 40% and 90% real
depreciation.

MAIN RESULTS

21 industrial countries: 19742003

Before and after study of 21
episodes of CAR
incorporating as control
group countries in which
current account widened
sharply but without
reversing in the following
years
In contrast to similar studies
for industrial countries, it
analyzes the dynamics of
financial account in CAR
episodes.
It examines the adjustment of
the US current account in
the late 1980’s

Does not find systematic
evidence of a relationship
between current account
adjustments and output
growth and exchange rates
changes.
There is not a clear association
between CAR and the
behavior of capital flows.
The experience of the US in
1987 has notable differences
to similar episodes in other
industrial countries,
particularly in the role
played by official flows.

High-Income OECD countries:
1980-2003

Estimates a multivariate
model for 26 CAR episodes
for studying its impact on
relative GDP growth, real
exchange rate, and the
extent to which the deficit is
resolved in the three years
following the CAR.
Incorporates the role for the
size of the current trough,
the persistence of the
deficits, spending
composition, openness and
the net foreign asset
position.

CAR tends to be associated
with slow economic growth
and a real depreciation.
Finds little evidence that
persistence of deficits, larger
net foreign debt positions.
Larger short-term capital
flows, or lower openness
increase the impact of CAR
on growth and exchange rate
adjustment.
