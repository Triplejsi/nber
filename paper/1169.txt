Changes In The Balance Sheet Of The U.S. Manufacturing
Sector, 1926—1977

ABSTRACT

This is a report on the results of a research project, sponsored

by the NBER's Program on Financial Marketsand Monetary Ecorwmics, which
involves the collection and organization of income account and balance

sheet data, at the firm level, for the years 1926—77. The primary data
source for the study is Moody's Industrial Manual. Working at the firm level,
it is possible to obtain accurate information on the market values of
traded securities.

This paper presents and discusses some of the aggregate characteristics
of the dataset and also reports the results of estimating a simple portfolio
model which attempts to explain changes in firm balance sheet flows for the
periods 1927—35 and 1965—77.

The data collected for the study, as well as software necessary to

manage them efficiently, are available from the authors. ?n NBER Technical
Paper will shortly be available to describe the dataset and software in detail.

I ntroduct ion

This paper reports the results of a research project which involves the
collection and organization of income account and balance sheet data, at the
individual firm

level,

for the years 1926—1977. The primary data source for the

study is Moody's Industrial Manual.

By working at the level of the individual firm,

it

is possible to obtain

more accurate information on the market values of traded securities, and more
detailed information on the structure of firms'

balance

sheets than is typically

available at the aggregate level. Accurate data on the incane accounts and

balance sheets of firms over a substantial period of time can provide
researchers with a rich source of information, against which specific hypotheses

regarding corporate financing and investment decisions can be tested. The data

collected for this study, as well as software necessary to manage them eff i—
ciently, are available fran the authors in either IBM or VAX formats at a nani—

nal fee. An NBER Technical Paper is also available which describes the dataset
and software in detail.

The first section of the paper briefly describes the manner in which the
data were collected and organized. A more detailed presentation of the characteristics of the dataset and accc!npanying ccxnputer software can

be

found in the

Appendix. Section two considers the aggregate characteristics of the sample. In

particular, firm

average data on the sources and uses of funds, market

valuations, and rates of return are presented for the 1926—1977 period. The
third section of the paper reports on the results of utilizing sane firm-level
data to estimate a simple portfolio model which attempts to explain changes in
balance sheet flows.

1. Collection and Organization of the Data

The primary

of undertaking this research project was to construct a

goal

of time for use in testing Specific
investment decisions, and the financial

micro dataset covering a substantial period
hypotheses regarding firm

financing

and

markets' valuations of these activities. A secondary goal was to organize and
present

the data in a manner that would allow other researchers to conveniently

access, verify and extend the basic dataset. To that end, the project also
involved the creation of canputer software to provide easy access to and

retrieval of

the data.

The sample of firms for the period 1926—1977 is actually cxiiosed of nine

separate subsamples, drawn periodically

fran various issues of

Industrial Manual. The ccxnposition of these subsamples is outlined in Table 1.

The goal was to obtain nine overlapping subsamples of size fifty. Subject to
restrictions on fiscal year, degree of consolidation, decipherability of ccrnplex
transactions, and natural resource intensiveness, fifty—two firms were initially

selected using a set of randan numbers spanning the number of pages in each
Moody's edition.

Referring to

Table 1, 28 firms in subsamples one through

seven were deleted ex post because closer examination revealed inconsistencies
with the initial selection criteria. For subsarnpleS eight and nine, only 77 of

the 104 firms initially selected survived,

due primarily to changes in
acquisitions) which could not te

was

necessary to read the additional information provided in MOOy, and

to employ issues of the Manual fran several years of the subsample. For
instance, nultiple issues of the Manual were necessarily referenced when firms
retired a debt or preferred stock issue during the subsample interval. In cases
where information on the outstanding arrounts of individual debt issues for par—

ticular years were missing, the sinking fund terms were used to interpolate for
the missing values.

The replacement value figures reported for firms' inventories (data item
45) are generally available for the firms of subsample nine f ran footnotes in

Moody's for the years 1976 and 1977. Also, a substantial fraction of firms
increased the anount of inventories carried on a LIFO basis in 1974, and also

reported the replacement values. To fill in data for missing years, twenty
industry—level price indices were used to construct estimates in the manner
suggested by Lindenberg and Ross (1981). For subsamples seven and eight, book
values of inventories were cónverted to replacement values using indices for the

aggregate manufacturing sector. For all subsamnples, book values of plant and
eguipoent were converted to replacement values using Census Bureau deflators for

the manufacturing sector, One way in which the quality of these data could
clearly be improved would be to gather replacement values fran Form 10—K's for

recent years, and use industry deflators carputed by other researchers for
earlier years. The existing software would allow these new deflators to be
easily integrated with the main body of data.

An interesting feature of the results presented in Table 3 is the rather
dramatic decline in the Cash Items variable, which is

canposed primarily of cash

and short—term marketable securities. Considered in conjunction with the recent

increase in the role of debt in corporate capital structures, the decline is

even nore striking. Closer inspection reveals that, at least

since the

mid—l960's, the fall in the share of Cash Items in net assets has been accampanied by an increase in the share of physical capital. The drastic increase in
Current Liabilities in 1941 was due primarily to increased corporate taxation.

Sources and Uses of Funds

Figure 1 illustrates the relative importance of internal and external funds

in financing the "average" firm, while Figure 2 depicts the role of debt

external sources of finance. In both figures, the large spikes appearing above
the years 1937, 1941, 1947, 1951, 1956, and 1974 coincide with periods of unusual inventory accumulation and apparently represent a demand for external funds

to finance unplanned inventories. However, this is not true for the broad spike

that appears above the years 1965—1968. 1)iring this period there was an unusually large demand for funds for capital expenditures and for takeovers.1

To highlight the longer—run trends, data on sources and uses of funds have

been averaged over the individual years of the subsamples, and the results are
presented in Table 4. According to these results, net issues of debt securities
remained quite constant fran the 1936—1941 period through the mid—l960's, when a

large shift toward external sources of funds occurred. In fact, the percentage

of total sources accounted for by net debt issues since 1965 is about twenty,
slightly nore than double the pre—1965 period.

Figure 3 plots 'q' for the average firm in each of the nine overlapping
subsarnples and also indicates the ccnposition of the ratio as between debt,
equity, and preferred stock cc*iponents. For instance, the distance between the

horizontal axis and the first broken line represents the market valuation of
debt securities relative to net assets. To assist in interpreting the figure,
Table 5 provides the average values for the overlapping years of the subsamples,
as well as for 1926—1927 and 1976_1977.2 A ccuiplete listing of the data used to

Both

Table

5 and Figure 3 clearly indicate the increasing importance of

debt in the capital structure of the t1average" corporation. What is sanewhat
surprising is that the sum of debt and preferred stock, relative to net assets,

has remained virtually constant over the entire fifty—year period, suggesting
that the increase in debt has cce

primarily

at the expense of preferred stock.

Another feature of Figure 3 which clearly stands out is the sharp fall and sub-

sequent rapid recovery of the cawon equity canponent

of

the ratio during the

1930—1934 period. This is even rrore dramatic when one considers that capital
goods prices were falling and, thus, reducing net assets and Iioving the ratio in

the opposite direction. The figure also plainly shows the substantial decline of
equity values that began in 1968. This slide in the ratio of the market value of

equity relative to net assets is steeper and nore prolonged than any previous
decline illustrated in the diagram.

Because of significant sampling differences between the subsamples, Figure
3 has several substantial jumps which hinder interpretation. This is especially
true for the nost recent years. Figure 4 and Table 7 present data on 'q' for the

The rates of return reported in Table 9 ignore the effects of both actual

and expected inflation upon the real value of the firms' financial assets and
liabilities. In particular, the canponent of the rate of return on net assets
which reflects the tax deductibility of the inflation premium contained in ncmi—

nal interest rates is not included in the calculations. Also, no allowance is

made for the distributional effects of realized inflation versus anticipated
inflation between creditors and stockholders. However, because the difference

between paper assets and paper liabilities, relative to total net assets, is
Only +0.02 for 1961—70 and —0.055 for 1971—77 one would expect these effects to
be small.

Conclusion

This section has presented sane of the aggregate characteristics of the
sample of manufacturing firms for the years 1926—1977. The results, as regards

the postwar period, are broadly consistent with those obtained by other
researchers. That is, the data illustrate the

increasing importance of external

financing——particularly debt——as a source of funds for firms' real investment
expenditures. The results also illustrate the dramatic decline that has occurred

in the past fifteen years in the securities markets' valuation of net assets
relative to replacement values, and also relative to rates of return.

while the net cash flow variable enters contemporaneously. All variables are
measured as deviations around firm means.

The Regime I results indicate that substantial portfolio reallocations take

place in response to increases in 'q' and CF. On the asset side of the balance
sheet, the largest responses to changes in both 'q' and CF are in real assets:

plant and equipment, inventories, and other long term assets. Recalling that
other long term assets primarily represent acquisitions, it is not surprising

that its 'q' coefficient is larger than that reported for investment expenditures. On the liability side, this increase in fixed assets is accompanied
primarily by increases in long term debt and ccmn

equity.

Contrary to prior expectations, cash flow is a nre important variable in

classifying observations between regimes than 'q', the respective standard
deviations of CF and q being 0.02 and 0.30.

Figures ----and 9 plot the results of aggregating the variables of the
investment equation across firms, by regime, using the estimated classification

probabilities as weights. That is, the label P*q is E Pitqt . Given the
underlying model, the appropriate variables to include in equations explaining

aggregate balance sheet flow variables would be p*q,

(l_p)*q, P*CF, and

(l_P)*CF. This procedure would account for the changing distribution of firms by
regime.

For example, it can be seen from Figure 8 that while aggregate q was
falling during 1973, the proportion of firms classified into Regime I increased
dramatically,

actually increasing P*q• This provides a possible explanation for

the fact that investment was increasing during a period when aggregate q was
falling.

Item 01 is sales and the data are in thousands of dollars, for years

1953, 1952,..,]947. Thus, in 1953 Bristol Myers Co. had sales of

This data item gives an estimate of the replacement value of a

firm's inventories.

The estimates in many cases are actually

provided by the firms themselves in footnotes to the Moody's tables.
When the only information available is the proportion of inventories

in LIFO and the length of time LIFO has been used, one of twenty
available price indices is used to estimate the replacement value of

LIFO inventories. FIFO inventories are assumed to equal replacement
value.

Data Item 46.

This variable is the reported proportion of

Availability of Data Items.

Items 45

through 51 are available only for the 1978 Panel (years 1971—1977).

Item 19, additions at cost, and Item 1, sales, are not reported for
the 1931 and 1936 Panels. Data Item 1. for the 1931 and 1936 Panels

2. Variable Transformations
PI½NEL Data System permits the user to def me up to 76
variable transformations. The current version of subroutine NGREG
The

contains 53 transformatiOns. In performing

transformations the user

can introduce external data via the data file P3GRE3. Currently,
a capital stock deflator (DEFL), preferred stock dividend—Price
index
ratio (PDIV), inventory deflator (PIN), and bond price
(Ba1DP) are present in the PI3GPEX file. DEFL is used to convert
firms'

capital

stock (Data Item 14), which

is

iasured on a

historical cost basis, to a replacement cost basis; PIN serves
function for inventories. PDIV is the (madium

a similar

grade industrial) preferred

dividend—Price ratio used to capita-

lize the dividends paid on the

nontraded preferred stock. WDP

is a bond price index.
