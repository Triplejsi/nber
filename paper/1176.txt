Optimal Stock Trading with Personal Taxes: Implications
For Prices and the Abnormal January Returns

ABSTRACT

The tax law confers upon the investor a timing option--to realize capital

losses and defer capital gains. With the tax rate on long term capital gains
and losses being about half the short term rate, the tax law provides a second
timing option--to realize capital losses short term and realize capital gains

long term, if at all. Our theory and simulation with actual stock prices over
the 1962—1977 period establish that the second timing option is extremely

valuable: Taxable investors should realize their long term capital gains in
high variance stocks and repurchase the same or similar stock, in order to

the short—term status and realize potential future losses short

reestablish

term.

Tax trading does not explain the positive abnormal returns of small

firms. In

the

presence of transactions costs, tax trading predicts that the

volume of tax—loss selling increases from January to December and ceases in
the first few days of January. The trading volume seasonal maps into a stock
price seasonal only if tax—loss sellers are assumed irrational or ignorant of
the price seasonality.

INTRODUCTION

Capital gains and losses are taxed when the investor sells the stock——not

when gains and losses actually occur. Suppressing the distinction between the
short term tax rate on capital gains and losses and the long term rate, the
optimal trading policy is to realize capital losses immediately and defer
capital gains, thereby reducing the present value of the stream of tax
payments on capital gains net of tax credits on capital losses.
Constantinides (1983) formally derives the optimal trading policy, estimates
the value of this timing option as a fraction of the stock price, and finds

the effective tax rate on capital gains and on dividends. He also explains
how the capital gains tax influences the investor's optima], consumption and

investment program and derives the equilibrium pricing implications--how the
capital gains tax modifies the asset pricing models of Breeden (1979), Brennan
(1973) and Merton (1973).

With the tax rate on long term capital gains and losses being about half
the rate on short term capital gains and losses, the tax law confers upon the
investor a second timing option——to realize losses short term and realize

gains long term, if at all. For those investors who can draw the distinction
between the two tax rates, the second option is substantially more valuable

than the first one. Suppose that the investor bought the stock exactly one

year ago. If the stock price has declined, he optimally sells the stock and
repurchases it, realizing a short term capital loss immediately. If the stock
price has increased instead, the investor optimally defers the realization of

a short term capital gain and one day later faces two alternatives. First, he
may defer the realization of the long term gain. Second, he may sell the
stock and repurchase it, realizing a long term gain and reestablishing the

2

favorable

short term status, in order to realize future capital losses at the

short term rate.

Our theory, based on the option pricing argument

of

Black and Scholes

(1973), confirms that under broad conditions the investor ought to realize a

long term gain in order to reestablish the short term status. These
conditions apply to high variance stocks and even to medium variance stocks,
if transactions costs are low and the interest rate is low (see, Tables 1 and

2). The results are intuitively appealing. The timing option to realize
losses short term and gains long term is more valuable the higher the stock
variance, for essentially the same reason that a call option is more valuable

the higher the stock variance. Thus the higher the stock variance the
stronger

the incentive to reestablish the short term status even at the

expense of the tax on long term gains. Also, the lower the interest rate the
higher the present value of the future tax benefit of this option.
Transactions costs inhibit trading but the order of magnitude of the potential

tax benefit is large relative to even substantial transactions costs.
We simulate three active tax trading policies and the buy—and-hold policy

for a

large sample of NYSE— and AMEX—listed stocks over the period 1962—

1977. The performance

the

buy—and—hold

under optimal trading far exceeds the performance under

policy (see, Table 3

and Figures 1, 2, and 3). The

tax

trading benefit is large even when we allow for long term gains to offset

short term losses dollar for dollar. The results readily translate into an
annual tax subsidy which the government provides to taxable investors under

various provisions of the tax law.

We relate our findings to the

empirical

evidence on

positive

abnormal

returns by small firms, and positive abnormal returns in the month of

January. We argue that tax trading not only fails to explain, but exacerbates

3

the

small firm anomaly, and cast doubts on a proposed explanation based on

transactions costs. Regarding the January

anomaly, we find that tax-loss

selling predicts a seasonal pattern in trading volume, provided transactions

costs are present. Tax—loss selling predicts a seasonal pattern in stock
prices, only if we further assume irrationality or ignorance of the stock
price seasonality on behalf of investors.

reestablish the tax—advantageous short term status (see, Proposition 3). The
conclusions are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 for a range of parameter
values.

Section 5 reports the simulation of the trading policies. In Section

6 we relate our findings to the empirical evidence on the small firm anomaly

and the January anomaly. Concluding remarks are offered in Section 7.

2. THE TAX ENVIRONMENT
Unrealized capital gains and losses are not taxed. Realized capital
gains and losses are short term if the asset has been held for one year or

less, and long term otherwise. Net short term capital gains (or losses),
are defined as the total short term capital gains net of total short term

capital losses, including unused short term carryovers. Net long term capital

gains (or losses), XL, are defined as the total long term capital gains net
of total long term capital losses, including unused long term carryovers. If

From 1942 to 1976 the holding period was six months. In 1977 it was
increased to nine months, and in 1978 it was increased to one year.

4

both X and XL are nonnegative, short term capital gains are taxed at the
individual's marginal

tax

rate on ordinary income; and long term capital gains

are taxed at 40% (until October 1979, 50%) of the individual's marginal tax
rate on ordinary income.

2,3/

If both

X

and XL are nonpositive, then net

short term capital losses and 50% of net long term capital losses are
deductible

taxable
losses

from ordinary income. These deductions may

jointly decrease the

ordinary income by a maximum of $3,000 per tax year.

A complication of the tax code is that net short term losses offset net
long term gains one to one. Thus, if

< 0, the loss X + XL is taxed as long term; if XL < 0 < X and

X +

XL

X +

XL > 0, the

gain X ÷ XL is taxed as short term.
If an asset is sold at a loss and repurchased within

thirty days, the IRS

terms the transaction a "wash sale" and disallows the loss deduction. The
investor has a high probability to circumvent this rule by waiting thirty days

before repurchasing the same asset. A safer way to circumvent the rule is to
repurchase a different asset with the same risk and return characteristics.
In any case, the wash sale provision does not apply to dealers or individuals
who are in the business of trading stocks.

—2/Prior

to 1969 the maximum rate on long term capital gains was 25% even
to investors in tax brackets above 50%. In 1969—1976 (1976—1979) the marginal
tax rate on capital gains above the first $50,000 was as high as 421/2% (49%).

Until 1976 the deduction limit was $1,000. It was increased to $2,000
in 1977 and to $3,000 thereafter.

3, PROPERTIES OF THE OPTIMAL TRADING POLICY
An investor may

sell

stock to invest the proceeds in relatively

underpriced assets, consume, or rebalance his portfolio. We consider those
times at which the investor is not motivated by any of the above reasons to
sell stock and investigate the conditions under which he would optimally sell
stock and repurchase it for tax reasons.

5/

We defer the discussion of

transactions costs until Section 4.3.
There

are at least three representative tax scenarios. In the first one

the investor is a tax-exempt institution or an individual who continually
carries forward large capital losses and expects the deduction limit to remain
binding

for many years. The

marginal tax rate on

cap,ital gains and losses is

zero and the investor pays no attention to the realization of capital gains
and losses in pursuing his optimal investment policy.

In the second scenario the deduction limit is not binding and short term

and long term capital gains and losses are taxed at the same rate. This
scenario is plausible if (1) the individual investor is periodically forced to
sell some of his assets by factors beyond his control and, on average,

realizes large long term gains; and (2) he can defer the realization of short
term capital gains until the holding period exceeds one year and then realize
the capital gains long term. Then short term and long term capital losses

simply offset some of the long term capital gains. The optimal trading policy
is derived in Constantinides (1983) and is restated here for completeness.

PROPOSITION 0: Assume that transactions costs are zero and the tax rate on
long term capital gains and losses equals the tax rate on short term capital

benefit of switching to relatively underpriced assets and the cost of the

gains and losses. Then at any time that the investor is not forced to sell
the stock, he optimally realizes losses and repurchases the stock; and defers
the realization of gains.

In the third scenario we focus on the distinction between the short term

and the long term tax status. We assume that short term capital gains and
losses are taxed at the rate t,

taxed at the lower rate TL.

6,2/

and

long term capital gains and losses are

We examine the optimal trading policy under

the simplifying assumption that trading occurs in discrete, one-year

intervals. The length of the trading period conveniently coincides with the
length of the holding period beyond which short term capital gains and losses

become long term. If an asset is sold one year after purchase, the capital
gain or loss is short term or long term at the investor's discretion.

Obviously the investor delays the sale by at least one day if he has a short

term capital gain, but not if he has a short term capital loss. Propositions
1 and 2 state some properties of the optimal trading policy which are free
from distributional assumptions on the stock price.

PROPOSITION 1: Assume that trading occurs in one—year intervals only,
transactions

costs are zero, and the tax rate on long term capital gains and

6/

If the investor does not have short term gains, he offsets short term
losses against long term gains one to one and, effectively, cannot use to his
advantage the distinction between the short term and the long term tax
status. This complication is suppressed here and discussed later in

Section

5.4.

7/

We suppress the distinction between the tax rate on net long term

TL(net gains) = .4t, and the tax rate on net long term losses,
TL(net losses) = .5t. This is justified because long term losses offset some

gains,

the long term gains and the marginal tax rate on long term losses equals
the marginal tax rate on long term gains.

In any case, Propositions 1, 2, and 3 remain valid if the condition

conditions, T(margir1al gain) < 'r and T(marginal loss) < t.

losses is less than the tax rate on short term capital gains and losses, i.e.,
TL < T.

Then, at any time that the investor is not forced to sell the stock,

he optimally:

a.

Defers the realization of a short term gain.

b. Sells the stock and repurchases it to realize a loss, short term if
possible.

c. Sells the stock and repurchases it to change the long term status to

stock price is equal to the basis

the

a. Realizing the gain long term one year and one day after purchase dominates
the policy of realizing the gain short term one year after purchase. This
proves (a).

Next suppose that the stock was purchased just one year ago. By the
above argument, realizing a long term loss (by waiting one day before selling

the stock) dominates the passive policy. Also realizing the loss short term
dominates the policy of realizing it long term. This proves (b).
c.

The short term status dominates the long term status. With the short

switches to the short term status whenever he can do so costlessly. This
proves (c).

An investor holds a share of stock with price P, purchased t periods
ago at cost basis p. We introduce the concept of the value of a stock
position, v(P, P, t). At the time that the investor purchases the stock, the

The conclusion in this section is that the investor should optimally

the tax rate on long term capital

gains and losses. We state some known results which we employ in Section 4.2
to characterize the optimal trading policy when there is a distinction between
the short term and long term status.

With the two tax rates being equal, the value of a stock position is

of the time period that the stock has beeji held, and we write
V(P, P) without the argument t. The optimal policy, as stated in
Proposition 0, is to realize losses and defer gains, i.e.,

The functional form of V(P, P) is derived in Constantinides (1983) under the
assumption that the logarithm of the stock price follows a Wiener process with

stock price follows a binomial process, yields the following:

policy.

PROPOSITION 3:

Assume that trading occurs in one-year intervals only; there

are no forced realizations; the stock price is generated by a binomial process

with U1 < R

the tax rate on short term capital gains and losses, i.e.,

Under this policy we leave unspecified the action when P > uP

because thi contingency never arises: Before P > uP, the price will have
equalled uP at some earlier period, a long term capital gain will have been
realized, and the basis will have been updated.
This argument hinges on our earlier assumption that the stock price can
increase by only one step each year. If, instead, the stock price were

Our discussion following Table 1 in this section suggests that our conclusions
do not critically depend on the binomial process.

13

Proof:

By Proposition 2, when the stock price exceeds the basis, an optimal

policy is either to defer all gains, or to defer short term gains and realize
long term gains.
Assume,

for the sake of the argument, that the optimal policy is

to defer

all gains. Since only losses are realized, and are always realized short

is independent of the long

was obtained under the assumption that short term and long term gains and

Equations (8), (9) and (12) imply, after tedious manipulations, equation

(10). If equation (10) is violated the optimal policy is to realize a long

term gain when P = up.

This completes the proof.

If the short term and long term tax rates

L' =

> Cu — R)/(uR — 1)

are equal, then

and it is optimal to defer a long term gain. For

sufficiently low long term tax rate relative to the short term rate, it is

optimal to realize long term gains. The function (u — R)/(uR

—

1)

is

decreasing in R. For a sufficiently high interest rate condition (10) is
satisfied and the optimal policy is to defer a long term gain because the
future benefits associated with the short term tax status become less

valuable. The function (U - R)/(u.R

—

1)

is increasing in u. For

sufficiently high value of u condition (10) is violated and the optimal
policy is to realize a long term gain. The higher u is, the larger the
variance of the stock return. Thus it is optimal to. realize long term gains
on high variance stocks but not on low variance stocks.

Our conclusion may be criticized on the grounds that it is specific to

the assumed binomial process. For example the entry in Table 1 with

R = 1.05,

ji

and the critical ratio of tax

rates is .78. That is, provided the ratio

is less than .78, if the

stock price is 1.50 times the basis one year after purchase, the investor
optimally realizes a long term gain. Suppose, however, that the stock price
follows a different stochastic process so that one year after purchase it

could be any multiple of the basis. It does not necessarily follow that the
investor optimally realizes a long term gain, however large the gain may be.
An investor realizes a long term gain, however large the gain may be (within
the context of the binomial model), provided

We conclude that, in the absence of transactions costs, the investor

optimally realizes a long term gain on medium and high variance stocks,
however large the gain may be.

4.3 Proportional Transactions Costs
With proportional transactions costs the optimal policy is complex. We
simply assume that transactions costs are small so that it is plausible to
limit our attention to the two policies which are optimal in the absence of

transactions costs. As in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, we first assume that it is

16

optimal to defer gains. We then state conditions on the parameters such that

Stoll and Whaley (1983) estimate the round—trip transactions costs as

sum of the bid—asked spread and the minimum commission schedule provided
in the NYSE Fact Book until 1974, the last year of fixed commissions. For
1960—1979, they find the average round-trip transactions costs to be 6.77% for
the largest decile NYSE—listed stocks, and 2.71% for the smallest decile NYSE—
listed stocks. These estimates exaggerate the transactions costs applicable
to medium size and large investors: First, negotiated commissions are
small. Second, sophisticated investors, who can wait a few days before they
execute a trade, need not have the full bid—asked spread work against them.
Analyzing 215,000 individual tickets on over $27 billion of equity trades by
thirteen organizations in 1978 and 1979, Beebower and Surz (1980) conclude
that the average round—trip transactions costs rate is less than 1% f or each
one of these organizations.

5. SIMULATING TRADING POLICIES WITH
ACTUAL STOCK PRICES, 1962-1977

5.1 Introduction
We simulate three trading policies over the fifteen year period, 1962-

1977, and compare their performance against the buy—and-hold policy. We start
in 1962, the first year covered by the University of Chicago's CRSP Daily

Stock Master file. The investment in each stock is made on December 3, 1962,
and trading in future years occurs only once every year at the beginning or
middle of December.

(The description of the tradThg policies explains how

the exact trading day is chosen.)

We assume that the 1982 tax law was in force over the simulation

period. The simulation then predicts the future effectiveness of the active
trading policies under the current tax

law, if the price fluctuations in the

1962—1977 period are representative of the future. The holding period beyond
which short term capital gains and losses become long term is taken to be one
year instead of six or nine months (which was the statutory time interval in

the 1962-1977 period). The marginal tax rate on ordinary income and on short
term capital gains and losses is taken to be 50%. The marginal tax rate on
long term capital gains and losses is taken to be 20%. The limit on the

12/
With individual investors' capital gains and losses taxed only once
every

year, investors have an incentive to realize their losses in December

instead of the following January and defer their gains from December to the
January. The implied trading volume seasonality is discussed in
Section 6.2 in connection with the January stock return anomaly.
A referee suggested that we simulate a policy in which losses are
realized in December and gains are realized in January. We discuss this
policy in Section 5.4 as policy V and argue that it is practically indis—
tinguishable from policy III which we simulate.

following

capital

loss deduction from ordinary income is assumed nonbinding. This

assumptionS overestimates the effectiveness of the active policies.

The sample includes all securities which were on the CRSP Daily Stock

Market file as of December 3, 1962, and remained on file until December

1977. Of the 2,027 securities on file on December 3, 1962, only 1,147
remained on file until December 1977, and qualify for inclusion in the

sample. In a merger, reorganization, or exchange, if a security on file is
replaced by another security on file until December 1977, then the security is

included in the sample. If a security is delisted from the NYSE and
immediately
the

of

relisted on

the AMEX (or vice versa), the security is included in

sample, provided it is on file until December 1977. Finally, suspension

trading by the SEC or halting of trading by the exchange for more than one

year disqualifies a security for inclusion in the sample.
The highest variance stocks are the ones most likely to be delisted from
the NYSE or AMEX. Our exclusion from the sample of all stocks not
continuously listed over the 15-year simulation period eliminates from the
sample many high variance stocks.

Furthermore, the highest variance stocks

are likely to be small firms traded over-the—counter and therefore exclUded

from the sample. The selection procedure eliminates many

high

variance stocks

for which the active trading policies work best.

By eliminating stocks which the investor would be forced to sell before
the completion of the 15—year period, the selection procedure overestimates
the effectiveness of the policy of deferring gains throughout the 15—year

period (policy I) but not of the policy of realizing all gains and losses in

low variance group.

every year (policy II). The selection procedure only slightly overestimates
the effectiveness of the poiicy of realizing gains in alternate years (policy
III).

All securities on the CRSP file are classified by CRSP into ten portfolios with equal number of securities, based on the variance of the daily

excess return in 1962. Portfolio one includes the securities with the highest
variance and portfolio ten includes those with the lowest. We classify the
sample of 1,147 securities into three groups as follows: 367 high variance
stocks with CRSP variance classification 1—4; 361 medium variance stocks with
CRSP variance classification 5—7; and 419 low variance stocks with CRSP

variance classification 8—10. We do not reclassify the stocks into groups in
subsequent years although their CRSP variance classification may change
annually.

One hundred dollars are invested in each stock on December 3, 1962. The
number of purchased shares is maintained constant throughout the 15—year
period, adjusted only for stock splits, stock dividends, mergers, reorganiza-

tions and exchanges. Cash dividends, partial liquidations, and cash proceeds
from selling rights are not used to repurchase stock. These cash distributions are taxed at the marginal tax rate of 50%, if appropriate, and are
deposited each December in a cash fund that we associate with each stock and

reclassification of stocks by variance would be meaningless in
our simulation because we compare the performance of the active policies
against a policy of buying the stock and holding it over 15 years. One of the
conclusions derived from the simulation is that the active trading policies
work best for high variance stocks. This conclusion would be reinforced if
the simulation was done with stocks which not only had high variance in 1962
but which maintained high variance throughout the 15-year period.

for each policy.

The cash fund is invested each December in one—year

Treasury bills, with the interest earned on the Treasury bills being taxed at

50% and reinvested until December 1977. If a capital loss is realized on the
stock, the tax rebate is also deposited in this fund. If a capital gain is

realized on the stock, the tax due is subtracted from the fund. The balance
of the cash fund may

be positive or negative. In December 1977 this balance

is added to the after—tax proceeds from selling the stock.

the after—tax cash distributions and tax rebates with interest, is added to
the after—tax proceeds from selling the stock. The sum is the net proceeds in
year 1977 under policy I.
Under the buy—and—hold, one hundred dollars are invested in the stock on
December 3, 1962. On the same date in December 1977 that the stock is sold
under policy I, the stock is sold under the buy-and-hold. Capital gains or
losses are realized long term. The cash fund associated with this policy and
which has the after-tax cash distributions with interest, is added to the

after—tax proceeds from selling the stock. The sum is the net proceeds in
year 1977 under the buy—and—hold.

The ratio XI/XBH of the net proceeds of policy I and the buy—and—hold
is a measure of their relative performance.

Adjustment for risk is

unnecessary in this comparison because the number of shares is held constant
in both policies.

In Table 3 and in Figure 1 we report this ratio for the

three variance groups of stocks with zero transactions costs and with 4%

round—trip transactions costs. Referring to Figure 1, in the absence of
transactions costs the wealth relatives are never less than one because policy
I

dominates the buy-and—hold. Policy I outperforms the buy—and-hold by a

greater margin for high variance stocks than for medium or low variance

stocks. The option to realize losses and defer gains is more valuable for
high variance stocks than for medium or low variance stocks.

18/

-

An alternative measure of their relative performance, (X1 — 100)/(XBH
100), exaggerates the benefit of the active policy for stocks that have low

realized return over the simulation period, i.e., XBH

100.

19/

This statement is correct only to a first approximation. By analogy,
portfolio consisting of a call option and a bond paying off the exercise
price at the option's maturity, has the same risk as a share of stock only to

a

a first approximation. There is no practical way to refine the adjustment for
risk in our simulation or even estimate the direction of bias.

23

The superiority of policy I over the buy-and-hold is modest. For the
group of high variance stocks the median wealth ratio of policy I and the buy—
and—hold is 1.043 with zero transactions costs, and 1.016 with 4% round—trip

transactions costs. In policy II the investor realizes even long term gains
in order to reestablish the tax—advantageous short term status. As we shall
see,

this policy pays off handsomely.

Policy II: Realize Gains and Losses in Every December

on the following trading day. We deposit the tax rebate in the cash

fund associated with the stock. If, instead, the stock has a capital gain, we
wait until the following trading day. If the stock still has a capital gain,

we realize it long term and repurchase the same number of shares on the
following

trading day. The capital gains tax is paid out of the cash fund

associated with the stock. We repeat the procedure until 1977. In December
1977

the stock is sold. The after—tax proceeds plus the balance of the cash

fund is the net proceeds under policy II. Under the buy—and—hold, one hundred

dollars are invested in the

stock

on December 3,

1962.

On the same date in

December 1977 that the stock is sold under policy II, the stock is sold under
the buy-and—hold. The after-tax proceeds plus the balance of the cash fund is
the net proceeds under the buy—and—hold.
The ratio

reported

in

of the net proceeds under policy II

and the buy—and—hold is

Table 3 and Figure 2. The performance of policy II is spectacular

for high and medium variance stocks, even with 4% round-trip transactions

costs. Updating

the basis yearly and reestablishing the short term

far more profitable

status is

than the policy of realizing losses and deferring gains.

24

The results are in agreement with the theoretical prediction of Section 4 and
Tables 1 and 2.

The optimal policy, as discussed in Section 4, is to realize gains long
term, provided the ratio of the stock price to the basis is below some

critical number. It is only for stocks which satisfy equation (16) and which
are marked with a dagger in Table 1 that the optimal policy is to realize a

gain, however large it may be. In policy II gains are realized however large

they may be. Therefore, the results underestimate the effectiveness of a more
sophisticated policy of deferring large gains on low variance stocks.
Under the assumption that the holding period for long term capital gains

and losses is six months (as was indeed the case in he years 1962—1976)
instead of one year, policy II is dominated by the policy of realizing all

capital gains long term and all capital losses short term every December and

(This statement is true even though short term losses and long term
gains incurred in the same year offset each other one to one.) Therefore
June.

policy II underestimates the effectiveness of a more sophisticated policy
applicable in the years 1962—1976.
In a different sense policy II overestimates the benefits of tax

trading. If the investor applies policy II to a portfolio of assets (instead
of a single asset), each year he typically realizes short term losses on some

stocks and long term gains on others. The offsetting of gains and losses
undermines the effectiveness of policy II. The next policy is designed to
overcome

5.4

this problem.

Policy III: Realize Gains in Alternate Deceabers and
Realize Losses in Every December
One hundred dollars are invested in

the

stock on December 3, 1962. In

Decembers of odd years gains are deferred and losses are realized, short term
if

possible.

In odd years the problem

of one

to one offsetting between short

25

term losses and long term gains does not arise because no gains are
realized.

In Decembers of even years both gains and losses are realized.

Gains are realized long term. The investor may be able to realize the losses
short term provided the asset was last purchased one year ago, and there are
no realized long term gains on other assets to offset the short term gain one

to one. We cannot ascertain whether the investor has realized long term gains
on other assets in the same year without having observed the realized returns

on all of the portfolio assets. In policy III we simply assume that all
losses realized in even years (but not in odd years) are realized long term.
This assumption being conservative, policy III underestimates the
effectiveness of the optimal policy.

On December 1977 the stock is sold. The after-tax proceeds plus the
balance of the cash fund is the net proceeds under policy III. On the same
date in December 1977 that the stock is sold under policy III, the

stock is

sold under the buy-and—hold. The after-tax proceeds plus the balance of the
cash fund is the proceeds under the buy—and—hold.

The ratio of the net proceeds under policy III and the buy-and-hold is
reported

in Table 3

and Figure 3. Even though policy III exaggerates the

adverse effect of tax offsetting between short term losses and long term
gains, it substantially outperforms the buy—and—hold for all categories of

stocks. Even with 4% round—trip transactions costs, policy III outperforms
the buy—and—hold for high variance and some medium variance stocks.

A variant of policy III, which we may call policy IV, is to defer gains

and realize losses,

preferably short term, in odd years. So

far the policy is

the same as policy III. But in policy IV, in even years gains are realized
long term and losses are deferred. This differs from policy III in that in
policy III losses are realized long term in even years. A momentts reflection
should convince the reader that policy III dominates policy IV in the absence

26

of

transactions costs. In the presence of transactions costs policy III does

not dominate policy IV because it involves more frequent transactions.
Simulations not reported here confirm that, in the absence of transactions

costs, policy III dominates policy IV. With 4% round—trip transaction costs
policy III still outperforms policy IV.
Yet another variant of policy III, which we may call policy V, is to
realize

gains

losses, preferably short term, every December; and realize long term

only on the Januaries of odd years (instead of realizing them on

of even years). An upper bound on the performance of this policy is

by replacing the tax rate on long

term gains in policy III by

+ r), where r is the interest rate; and leaving the tax rates on

long term and short term losses unchanged. We conclude
marginally

that policy V is

only

superior to policy III.

realization of capital gains and losses. The option is utilized under the

EMPIRICAL IMPLICATIONS

The Abnormal Returns of Small Firms
Banz (1981) and subsequently Reinganum (1981) and others document the

small-firm anomaly: Classifying all NYSE-traded stocks into five portfolios
based on stock market value, and using monthly returns over the period 1931—
1978, Keim (1983b, Table 2) reports that the annual average excess return of

the smallest quintile firms exceeds the annual average excess return of the

largest quintile firms by 16%. We argue that tax trading, not only fails to
explain the anomaly, but also casts doubts on Stoll and Whaley's (1983)
explanation which is based on transactions costs.
If tax trading is to explain the anomaly, we must identify some

characteristic of large firms which makes them better candidates for tax

trading than small firms. Variance of return is not the sought-after
characteristic. Small firms have higher variance of return than large
firms. Then the tax timing option is more valuable for small than for large
firms and the prediction is that small firms have lower before-tax mean return

— Also
20/

there are at least three pieces of empirical evidence which cast
doubts on a tax trading and/or transactions costs explanation of the size
anomaly. First, Brown, Kleidori and Marsh (1983) find that, although ranking
on firm size appears to produce excess returns inconsistent with the CAPM, the
sign of the excess returns is unstable over time. Second, Keim (1983a) finds
that nearly half of the excess returns are due to just the month of January.
Third, Chen (1983) finds that APT factor risk premia partly explain the
anomaly; and Chan, Chen and Hsieh (1983) find that macroeconomic variables
suggested by factor analysis and the APT partly explain the anomaly.

Relying on the differential transactions costs between small and large
firms,

They

claim to explain the anomaly. They compare the

find that the abnormal returns of small firms become

statistically insignificant, provided that the round-trip

transactions costs

are incurred at least annually, and interpret their findings as a resolution

of the anomaly. Whereas they explicitly incorporate transactions costs, they
omit from their calculations the perceived benefit which prompts investors to

trade despite the presence of these costs. If the rceived benefit from
trading in small firms is larger than the benefit from trading in large firms,

it may

with

compensate

the investor for the higher transactions costs associated

small firms, thereby leaving the anomaly unexplained.

—

21/

The following (contrived) argument based on transactions costs may
explain the direction, but not the magnitude, of the anomaly. For small firms
transactions costs are large and investors follow the buy—and--hold policy.
For large firms taxable investors follow an active policy, taking advantage of
the distinction between the short term and the long term tax rates. With zero
transactions costs, after fifteen years of tax trading, the mean wealth ratio
under policy II and the buy—and-hold is 1.604 (see, Section 5.3 and Table
3). Effectively, the government subsidizes the investment in the stock of
large firms at the annual rate of (1/15)9n 1.604 = .032. No such subsidy
applies to the stock of small firms. Taxable investors bid up the stock
prices of large firms and, in equilibrium, the annual, after-tax mean return
of small firms exceeds the mean return of large firms by 3.2%. Assuming 20%
capital gains tax, the before—tax difference in the mean returns is
3.2/.8 = 4.0%. The benefit disappears once we recognize that (1) for large
firms the variance of stock return is below the average variance, (2) the

differential transactions costs are exaggerated, and (3) we must follow a
trading policy (e.g., policy III) to avoid the disadvantageous offsetting
short term losses and long term gains.

29

To illustrate the point, consider the subset of trades generated by
22/

taxable investors following trading policy III (see, Section 5.4). We
capture the differential transactions costs between small and large firms by

assuming that the round—trip transactions costs rate is 4% for small firms and

zero for large firms. We also recognize the fact that the stock returns of
small firms are more variable than the stock returns of large firms. For high
variance stocks and 4% transactions costs, the mean wealth relative of policy

III and the buy-and-hold is 1.359 for medium variance stocks and zero
transactions costs, the mean wealth relative is very similar, being 1.383
(see, Table 3).

For

small firms, the high variance of stock return

differential transactions costs fail to explain the small—firm anomaly.
6.2 The Abnormal January

Returns

Wachtel (1942) and subsequently Dyl

(1973), Officer (1975), Rozeff and

Kinney (1976), and others document the abnormally high January stock

returns. Dyl (1973) and Branch (1977) find positive abnormal returns for
stocks that have experienced losses during the previous year. Roll (1983)
finds that most of the abnormal returns occur on the last trading day of

December and the first four trading days of the following January. Also

22/

We do not claim that capital gains tax is the most important reason
for trading. In fact it is difficult to explain the observed volume of stock
trading without explicitly recognizing that agents are asymmetrically
informed. Glosten and Milgrom (1982) present a model of heterogeneously
informed traders to explain the bid-asked spread and the trading volume. The
price path is such that the uninformed traders' rate of return equals the
discount rate, if they hold the stock for T periods. Our point remains
valid in the context of their model also: The informed traders' rate of
return exceeds the discount rate. Also, an uninformed trader has an incentive
to hold the stock for longer than T periods and earn a rate of return higher
than the discount rate. This is so because there is no endogenous reason in
the model to sell the stock after T periods.

30

Givoly

and Ovadia (1983), Reinganum (1983) and Roll (1983) find that the

abnormal

returns of stocks, that have experienced losses during the previous

year, are substantially larger for small rather than large firms.
Several of these studies discuss tax-loss selling as a possible explanation of
the anomaly. Dyl (1973, 1977) finds abnormally low (high) December trading volume

for stocks that have appreciated (depreciated) during the year but correctly argues
that the volume seasonality does not imply a price seasonality, if the demand for
stocks

is perfectly elastic. Gultekin and Gultekin (1982) and Korajczyk (1982)

study the seasonality in stock index returns in several countries, with widely

differing tax laws and tax year—end. With some reservations, Gultekin and Gultekin
(1982) interpret their findings as providing support for the tax—loss selling

hypothesis. Brown, Keim, Kleidon and Marsh (1983) find that Australian stocks have
positive abnormal returns in January and July and, to a lesser degree, in December
and August, although the tax year—end in Australia is June 30. Also Berges,
McConnell and Schlarbaum (1982) find that Canadian stock have positive abnormal
January returns even before 1972, although capital gains were not taxed in Canada
before 1972.

Our contribution to this debate is to identify the critical assumptions in a

tax-related explanation of the seasonality in trading volume and stock prices. We
consider four scenarios with different assumptions on tax rates and transactions
costs.

In the first scenario there is no distinction between the short term and long

term tax rates, and transactions costs are zero. The investor optimally realizes a
loss whenever it occurs, arid defers gains. Even though taxes are paid only at year—
end, the investor realizes a loss immediately, lest the stock price rises and the

opportunity of taking the loss vanishes. This scenario does not predict an increase
in tax—loss selling at year-end.

31

In the second scenario realized capital gains and losses are taxed at the lower
long term rate; long term gains do not offset short term losses dollar for dollar,

even if incurred in the same tax year; and transactions costs are zero. The
investor optimally realizes short term losses immediately, lest they become long

term or vanish. This scenario does not predict an increase in tax-loss selling at

year—end. The investor has an incentive to realize long term gains on medium and
high

to

variance stocks and reinstate the short term status. He also has an incentive

defer the realization

of the next one and
tax-gain

of capital gains from the end of one year to the beginning

save the interest

on the tax. This senario predicts decreased

selling at the end of a year and increased tax-gain selling at the

beginning of a year. If the selling pressure were to depress the price, this
scenario would predict a negative abnormal January return for stocks that have had
gains during the previous year.
In the third scenario realized capital gains and losses are taxed at the lower
long term rate; long term gains offset short term losses dollar for dollar in the

same year; and transactions costs are zero. The optimal policy is complex but we
identify the relevant factors: The investor wishes to realize short term losses

immediately, lest they become long term or vanish. However, if he has already
realized large long term gains earlier in the year, he wishes to defer the short

term losses to the following year, if possible. The investor wishes to realize long
term gains on medium and high variance stocks, preferably at the beginning of the
following

year. The important message is that none of these incentives predicts

increased tax—loss

selling

at year-end.

In the fourth scenario we assume that there is no distinction between the
short

term and long term tax rates, but there are transactions costs. If

is no price seasonality, the investor realizes his losses by following a
control—limit policy, as in Figure 4. At the beginning of the year he is
there

32

reluctant to incur the transactions costs and realize a small capital loss.
Towards the end of the year his reluctance is overcome by his preference for a
tax

rebate this year rather than next year. This policy predicts that tax-

loss selling gradually increases from January to December and suddenly ceases
in the first few days of January; realizing the loss at the end of December
dominates the realization of the same loss at the beginning of January.
An objection to the above argument is that, without

the distinction

between the short term and long term tax rates, transactions costs may
dissipate

the benefit of tax trading and the optimal policy may be to refrain

from tax—loss selling. However, when we draw the distinction between the
short term and long term tax rates, our simulation demonstrates that
transactions costs do not significantly decrease the benefit from tax trading

(see, Table 3). The optimal trading policy becomes complex, but the essential
point remains that, with transactions costs, tax-loss selling gradually
increases from January to December and suddenly ceases in the first few days
of January.

The selling pressure may or may not

affect the

stock price. The crucial

assumption is that, after selling the stock to realize a loss, investors do
not

a

repurchase the same stock

or

the stock sold by other investors to realize

loss. Then tax—loss selling depresses the price of stocks traded in

illiquid markets, such as the stocks

of

small firms.

With

the tax—loss

selling drying up at the beginning of January, the stocks experience positive
abnormal returns in January.

This explanation is subject to the criticism that otherwise sophisticated

tax—loss sellers are irrational or, at least, ignorant of the stock price
seasonality. Rational tax—loss
by

sellers should repurchase different stock sold

other tax-loss sellers at about the same time. Effectively, pairs of tax-

33

loss

sellers swap stocks

either one

If

and this activity does not depress the price of

of the stocks.

a tax—loss seller has a special reason (e.g., inside information) to

repurchase the same stock, he can wait at least one month before the
repurchase,
the

and bypass the wash sale

provision. Being rational, he can modify

trading policy illustrated in Figure 4,

December

accelerate tax—loss sales from

to the previous October or November, and thereby repurchase the stock

in time to receive the abnormal January returns. Alternatively, the investor
can change his tax year to end in a month other than December.

We conclude that tax—loss selling in the presence of transactions costs

predicts a seasonal pattern in trading volume. It predicts a seasonal pattern
in stock prices only if we further assume irrationality or ignorance on behalf
of investors.
7. CONCLUDING REMARKS

Tax trading does not explain the small—firm

anomaly, but predicts a

seasonal pattern in trading volume which maps into a seasonal pattern in stock
prices, the January anomaly, only if we assume irrationality or ignorance on

behalf of investors. These results in no way detract from the basic message
of our theoretical calculations and simulation: For those investors who can
draw

the distinction between the short term and long term tax rates, the

benefit of optimal tax trading on medium and high variance stocks outweighs
even

large transactions costs.

APPENDIX 1

Proof that V(P, P, t) is convex in P
Lemmas 1 and 2 lead to the main result, Lemma 3. Lemmas 1, 2, and 3
correspond to Merton's (1973b) Theorems 4, 9,- and 10.

LEMMA 1: V(P, P, t) is convex in P.

Proof: Consider two portfolios. Portfolio A consists of a shares with
A

price P per share, purchased at price p per share t periods ago; and
1 — a

shares with price P per share, purchased at price P per share t

periods ago. We restrict a by 0 ( a '. 1.

The value of portfolio A is
-

aV(P, P, t) + (1 — a)V(P, P, t).

Portfolio

B is simply one share with price P per share, purchased at
A

price aP + (1 — a)P

per share t periods ago.

If portfolio B is optimally liquidated at time T when the stock price

is P ,

the

after—tax proceeds are

(1 —

TL)PT

+ TL{aP + (1 —

a)P}. At

T, the after—tax proceeds in liquidating portfolio A are

in liquidating portfolio B. Therefore the value

of portfolio A at

t is at least as large as the value of portfolio B, i.e.,

aV(P, P, t) + (1 — a)V(P,

LEMMA 2:

Assume that the distribution of the stock return, Tt' at time

t is independent of the price P. Then, V(P, P, t) is homogeneous of
degree one in (P, P), i.e., v(hP, hP, t) = hV(P, P, t), h > 0.
The proof is left to the reader.

APPENDIX 2

Determination of the function V(P, P) when the short term and long term tax
rates are equal.

We determine the functional form of V(P, P) in the case P
comparing two

positions

in the same stock

but

P by

with different bases. Consider

two portfolios with the following composition:

First portfolio
A

(1)

V(uP, P) —

V(u1P, P) shares with basis P, P

P.
A

(ii)

A riskless, one-period bond with price R1[V(uP, P) - V(u1P, P)]V(uP, P).

Second portfolio
(i)

(ii)

V(uP, P) —

V(u1P, P) shares with basis P, P . P.

A riskiess, one—period bond with price R1[V(uP, P) — V(u1P, P)]V(uP, P).

One period later, the stock price is either uP or u'1P. If the stock price

is uP,

the

first portfolio's value is

[V(uP, P) —

V(u1P,

P)]V(uP, P) + [V(uP, P) —

V(u1P,

P)]V(uP,

)

and equals the second portfolio's value. If the stock price is u1P, the
first portfolio's value is

[V(uP, P) —

V(u1P, P))V(u1P, P) + [V(uP, P) — V(u1P,

P)]V(uP, P)

and again equals the second portfolio's value. Therefore, the investor is
indifferent between the two portfolios at the beginning of the period and we
obtain

[V(uP, P) -

V(u1P, P)]v(P, P) ÷ R1[V(uP, P) - V(u1P,

= [V(uP, P) -

V(u1P,

)

;)]V(uP, P)

]V(P, P) + R1 [V(uP, P) - V(u1P,

P) ]V(uP, P)

44

Rearranging, we obtain

where k is a constant to be determined. Since the left-hand side is
A

independent of P and the right—hand side is independent of P, k is

independent of P. P. Since V(P, P) is homogeneous of degree one in (P,
it follows that V(P, 0) is homogeneous of degree one in P. Setting P

P),

in (2.1) we obtain

Equations (6) and (2.2) imply 0 < k < 1.
We rewrite equation (2.1) as

Equation (2.3) has the following interpretation: V(P, P) is the expected

value of positions (uP, P) and (u1P, P) discounted by R, where the
expectation is with respect to the pseudoprobabilities 1 - k

actual probabilities 1 -

and k

The

q, q do not enter equation (2.3). The

corresponding result in the option pricing theory of Black and Scholes (1973)
is

that the option price is independent of the expected rate of return of the

underlying security.
We eliminate k from
equation

equations (2.2)

and (2.3) and obtain the

difference

It remains to determine the constants A and B. Using equation (7),

continuity of the function V at P

The boundary conditions (2.7) and (2.8) uniquely determine the constants A and
