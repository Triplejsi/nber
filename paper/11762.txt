ABSTRACT
If one ranks cities by population, the rank of a city is inversely related to its size, a well-documented
phenomenon known as Zipf's Law. Further, the growth rate of a city's population is uncorrelated with
its size, another well-known characteristic known as Gibrat's Law. In this paper, I show that both
characteristics are true of countries as well as cities; the size distributions of cities and countries are
similar. But theories that explain the size-distribution of cities do not obviously apply in explaining
the size-distribution of countries. The similarity of city- and country-size distributions is an
interesting riddle.

1. Introduction
Cities are a standard unit of observation in urban economics, just as countries are a norm
in international economics. The distribution of city sizes has been extensively studied. A couple
of striking empirical regularities characterize the distribution of cities within a country. The rank
(by size) of a city is almost perfectly inversely related to its size (at least for the largest cities), a
stylized fact known as “Zipf’s Law.” It is also well known that growth in cities seems to be
approximately proportionate, independent of city size; this is known as “Gibrat’s Law.” In this
short paper, I consider both of these well-known characteristics of city size distributions, and
show that they work about as well when one considers countries instead of cities.

2. Empirical Characteristics of City Size Distribution
The focus of this paper is a pair of well-known empirical regularities that characterize the
distribution of population size across cities. “Zipf’s Law” states that when cities are ranked by
the size of their populations, city size is inversely correlated with rank. “Gibrat’s Law” states
that the size of a city is uncorrelated with its growth rate. Both stylized facts are long
established, well known, and essentially undisputed to the best of my knowledge. Accordingly, I
now briefly provide results that use recent data and are representative of the larger literature.

City Size and City Rank: Zipf’s Law
“Zipf’s law for cities” states that the number of cities with population greater than S is
approximately proportional to 1/S.1 The relationship fits well, and Zipf’s Law characterizes the
cities of different countries at different points of time.2 A vast literature documents Zipf’s Law,
while a smaller literature attempts to explain it. Among the more recent references are Eeckhout

1

(2004), Gabaix (1999), Krugman (1996), and Rossi-Hansberg and Wright (2004); Gabaix and
Ioannides (2004) provide a recent survey and Nitsch (2005) a recent meta-analysis.
Two methods have been used in the literature to document Zipf’s Law: graphs and
regressions. Both begin by ranking cities by the size of their population (New York is currently
#1 in the United States, Los Angeles #2, and so forth). One then compares the natural logarithm
of city rank to the natural logarithm of city population, using either a) graphical or b) regression
techniques. Appendix Table A1 lists the populations of the largest American cities in 2000 (the
most recent census).
Figure 1 presents a typical set of graphs. The top-left graph is a scatter-plot of the rank of
the fifty largest America combined statistical areas (CSAs) in 2000 (on the ordinate or y-axis)
against their sizes (on the abscissa or x-axis). Collectively the fifty CSAs covered almost 152
million people at the time of the 2000 census, around 56% of the population of the United
States.3 A line with slope of –1 is provided to facilitate comparison. Clearly Zipf’s law works
well. These results do not depend much on the exact year; the top-right graph is the analogue for
1990 census data. The exact definition of “city” does not matter much either; analogues for the
200 largest metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in 2000 and 1990 are
provided in the bottom pair of graphs of Figure 1 (the 200 MSAs included almost 212 million
people in 2000, over three-quarters of the population of the United States).4
Analogous regression results are tabulated in Table 1; these corroborate the graphical
results. Each row in the table reports a regression of the log of city rank on the log of city size
(and an unreported intercept).5 Consider the results for the 50 largest CSAs in 2000, which are
presented in the top row. The slope coefficient is -1.03, close to the Zipf value of –1.6 I follow
Gabaix and Ioannides (2004) and approximate the standard error by β(2/N).5 where β is the slope

2

coefficient and N is the sample size; this delivers a standard error of .21 for the sample of 50
large cities.7 The regression fits well, with an unadjusted R2 of .98. Other lines in the table show
that my results do not depend sensitively on the year, and that the largest MSAs give results
similar to those of the largest CSAs.
A few other features are worthy of mention in passing. First, broadening the sample size
to include more cities tends to lower the Zipf slope coefficient systematically, as is clear from the
bottom part of Table 1. That is, there appear to be “too few” small cities for the entire
distribution of cities to satisfy Zipf’s law. This is a well-known tendency in the data; see e.g.,
Eeckhout (2004). Second, narrowing the definition of a city to that of a “Census Designated
Place” (CDP) raises the Zipf coefficient, also consistent with Eeckhout (2004).8 Finally these
results tend to characterize cities outside the United States, consistent with Rosen and Resnick
(1980). Zipf coefficient estimates are tabulated for 25 countries in appendix Table A2.9

City Size and City Growth: Gibrat’s Law
“Gibrat’s law for cities” says that the expected growth rate of cities is independent of city
size. Gabaix (1999) has shown that there is a tight theoretical link between Gibrat’s law and
Zipf’s law; if the former works well, the latter can be more easily understood. There is strong
evidence in the literature that Gibrat’s law is an empirical regularity that characterizes city
growth; see, e.g., Eeckhout (2004) for recent evidence and references.
Gibrat’s law works well for American cities. Graphical evidence is provided for
American cities in Figure 2. Consider the top-left graph that scatters the 1990-2000 population
growth rate of fifty largest (in 1990) American CSAs (on the ordinate) against their size in 1990
(on the abscissa).10 There is no clear relationship between the (log) population of a city in 1990

3

and its (population) growth rate over the following decade. The non-parametric data smoother
included in the diagram to “connect the dots” is essentially flat. The non-relationship between
city size and city growth also characterizes all 113 CSAs (portrayed in the top-right), as well as
the MSAs (in the bottom row).
Regression analysis confirms the visual impressions. In Table 2, I tabulate the slope
coefficient (and associated robust standard error) from regressions of city population growth
between 1990 and 2000 on the log of 1990 city population (and an unrecorded intercept).
Different rows present results for the largest cities and all cities, using both CSA and MSA
measures of city size. Three of the four slopes tabulated are insignificantly different from zero;
there is a significant relationship between size and subsequent growth when the entire set of
MSAs (but not CSAs) is included. All of the equations fit the data poorly.

3. Empirical Characteristics of Country Size Distribution
The preceding section summarized evidence that two stylized facts – Zipf’s law and
Gibrat’s law – characterize the size distribution of cities. But the size distribution of countries
has not been much studied, so far as I know. I now present results comparable to those of
section 2, but for countries.

Country Size and Country Rank: Zipf’s Law
Figure 3 is the analogue to Figure 1, but portrays large countries instead of large
American cities. The figure presents scatter-plots of the (natural logarithm) of country rank
against (log) country population. As with the cities, a line with slope of –1 is also provided.

4

There are nine graphics presented in the figure, portraying the size-rank distribution of the 50
largest countries at different years.
Just as there are different definitions of cities, there is no universal definition of a
“country.” Economists often ignore small countries such as Liechtenstein (just as they often
ignore small cities like Clovis, NM).11 Niue, a small island in the South Pacific, has been selfgoverning in free association with New Zealand since 1974 and had an estimated 2005
population of 2,166. Is it a country? As of July 2005, Tuvalu had a population estimated to be
11,636; Nauru had 13,048 people, and San Marino 28,880. 12 None of these countries has
military forces, a currency, or an embassy in the United States, but all were members of the
United Nations. Are any or all of these countries?
My default is to consider as “countries” all entities that are considered separately by
standard data sources such as the 2005 World Development Indicators or the CIA World
Factbook. This is easy and seems natural, since it adheres to the Ricardian notion that factors
such as labor are more mobile within a country than between countries (just as labor is more
mobile within a city than across cities). This also tends to coincide with the existence of a
central government with a monopoly on legal coercion.13 However, I do not rely on a single
definition of “country.” I also consider the set of independent sovereign nation states, so that I
exclude entities considered as “countries” under my broad definition such as Hong Kong (a
special administrative region of China), Puerto Rico (a commonwealth associated with the
United States), Reunion (an overseas department of France), the Cayman Islands (a British
crown colony) and the West Bank and Gaza strip (not internationally recognized as a de jure part
of any country). Since most such entities are small, my results do not typically depend on the

5

exact definition of “country.”14 The populations of the largest countries in 2004 are tabulated in
Appendix Table A3.15
The 1900 data are taken from The Statesman’s Yearbook 1901 (a few missing
observations are filled in from later editions); China was the largest country with 339.68 million
inhabitants while the smallest of the 50 “countries” portrayed is Kamerun, a German colony with
3.5 million. In 1900 the largest 50 “countries” account for 1.407 billion people, over 92% of the
world’s population. The 1950 data and the 2050 projection are taken from the U.S. Census
Bureau’s International Data Base, while data for 1960 through 2000 are taken from the World
Bank’s World Development Indicators.16 The 2004 populations were downloaded from the
CIA’s World Factbook. 17 In 2004, the largest 50 countries accounted for almost 5.6 billion
people, around 88% of the world’s population. Thus, the percentage of the total population
covered is comparable to (indeed, slightly higher than) that of large American cities.
Figure 3 shows that Zipf’s law works well for countries. The relationship between
country rank and size is close to inverse and linear; the biggest exception is the cross-section
from 1900. This is also true of independent sovereign nation states, portrayed in Figure A1.18
Corresponding regression results are tabulated in Table 3; I record the slope coefficients
from a regression of (log) rank on (log) size (and an unrecorded intercept), along with the
unadjusted R2. None of the slopes are different from –1 at traditional confidence levels, and
most are quite close to –1. The biggest exception is 1900, whose slope is slightly over one
standard deviation away from -1. It is striking that the slopes are close to -1 in spite of the fact
that the estimates are biased in small samples towards 0 (Gabaix and Ioannides, 2004). It is
interesting to note that the slope coefficients rise over time. Most interesting of all is how similar
the estimates are to the Zipf slopes for cities recorded in the top part of Table 1.

6

It is also interesting to compare two other empirical phenomena that have been
documented for cities. First, as noted above and in Table 1, a broader sample of cities tends to
be associated with a lower Zipf slope coefficient. The same is true of countries, as shown in
table A4. This reports the number of “countries” (including dependencies, colonies, and so
forth) with admissible population data, the Zipf slope coefficient and its standard error, and the
unadjusted regression R2. The slopes are substantially lower once all countries are included in
the Zipf regression, and the fit deteriorates accordingly. Appendix figure A6 presents a scatter
plot of country rank against country size in 2004, along with fitted lines for: 1) a Zipf regression
estimated over the entire sample of (237) countries; 2) another Zipf regression estimated with
only the 25 largest countries, and 3) a third regression fitted to the 150 largest countries.19 The
slope coefficient declines dramatically as smaller countries are included in the sample, consistent
with Eeckhout (2004). Just as there are “too few” small cities, there are too few small countries.
On the other hand, the results are insensitive to the exact definition of “country.”
Appendix table A5 shows that these patterns also characterize the data when dependencies,
territories, colonies, possessions, and so forth are excluded from the sample; it is the analogue to
Table 3, but estimated only for independent sovereign nation states. 1900 is now even more of
an exception, almost surely because colonies (like India, Indonesia, Nigeria, to name just the
largest few) are treated as independent observations in table 3, but are excluded from Table A5.

Country Size and Country Growth: Gibrat’s Law
Is the growth rate of a country’s population tied closely to its size? Figure 4 examines
this hypothesis; it is the analogue to Figure 2 for countries instead of cities. I take advantage of
the fact that the WDI provides comparable data for a large number of “countries” starting in

7

1960. The top-left graph scatters growth between 1960 and 1970 against the log of the
population in 1960. The other two graphs on the top row also start in 1960, but extend
subsequent population growth to 1980 (in the middle) and 2000 (on the right). The middle row
of graphs start in 1970, while the bottom row presents results that start in 1980 and 1990.
Throughout, each country is marked by a single dot, and non-parametric data smoothers are
included to “connect the dots.” There are few signs of a strong consistent relationship between
initial country size and subsequent population growth. The analogue for independent sovereign
nation states is provided in Figure A3, while that for the 50 largest countries is in Figure A4.
To corroborate this impression more rigorously, regression analysis is provided in Table
4. Analogously to Table 2, I regress the population growth rate on the log of the initial
population (and an unrecorded intercept); I report the slope coefficient, its robust standard error,
and the R2 of the regression. I vary the starting and ending years of the sample; I also use three
different sets of countries (all countries, all sovereigns, and the 50 largest countries).
The effect of initial population on its subsequent growth is always estimated to be
negative; smaller countries have faster population growth. That said, most of the slopes are
insignificantly different from zero at standard confidence levels. The hypothesis of no effect of
size on growth usually cannot be rejected, with exceptions when estimation starts in 1960, or
when sovereigns are considered and estimations ends in 2000. None of the regressions fit well.

Country Size: Log Normality
Until recently, work on Zipf’s law has focused on the largest cities. Eeckhout (2004)
uses recent American census data that covers the populations of over 25,000 “Census Designated
Places” in 2000. He finds that the distribution of places adheres closely to log-normality, as

8

might be expected if Gibrat’s Law works well. I now briefly investigate whether the distribution
of “countries” is approximately log-normal.
Figure 5 provides histograms of the natural logarithm of country population at nine
different years; the normal distribution is also portrayed to ease comparison. There is evidence
of right-skewness; there are “too few” medium and small countries. Still, there is little evidence
of kurtosis (fat tails). From an ocular viewpoint, log-normality fits reasonably well (Figure A5 is
the analogue for sovereign nation states).
More rigorous examination of log-normality is provided in table 5. I tabulate p-values
for the hypothesis of no excess skewness and kurtosis, both separately and jointly. Lognormality can be rejected for the first and last years I consider. On the other hand, it seems to be
a reasonable description of the distribution of country populations from 1960 through 2000.

4. Empirical Regularity, Theoretical Puzzle
Suppose we believe that cities and countries have similar population distributions. What
might explain this?
There has been little rigorous economic analysis of the size of countries. A notable
exception is the body of work by Alesina and Spolaore summarized in their (2003) book.
Alesina and Spolaore develop a theory of country size in which the benefits of size are offset by
the costs of increased heterogeneity. Larger countries can supply public goods more
inexpensively; they are also able to provide more regional insurance and income redistribution.
Productivity may also be higher in larger countries because specialization is limited by the size
of the market (especially for closed economies). But Alesina and Spolaore point out that these
benefits may be costly, since larger countries also tend to be more heterogeneous. But the focus

9

of Alesina and Spolaore is on the size of a representative country; they do not directly study the
size distribution of countries per se.
In contrast, there has been much professional interest in the determination and
distribution of city sizes; see, e.g., Eeckhout (2004), Gabaix (1999), Krugman (1996), and RossiHansberg and Wright (2004). Theories of city size typically balance the positive effects of
agglomeration against negative externalities. The former can result from e.g., knowledge
spillovers or scale economies, while the latter can arise from congestion, commuting, or land
prices. Both types of externalities are required to induce mobile labor to migrate between cities
in appropriate proportions. Krugman (1996) surveys a number of different theories that
rationalize Zipf’s Law for cities and finds (p 401) “it impossible to be comfortable with the
present state of our understanding.”
In Eeckhout (2004), the positive local production spillovers are offset by congestion and
higher property prices. Cities receive exogenous technology shocks, and identical workers are
free to choose between cities with high productivity, wages, property prices, and commuting
times and cities that have lower values for these variables. Rossi-Hansberg and Wright (2004) is
related but uses externalities and shocks at the industry level. Gabaix (1999) stresses the role of
shocks to a city’s amenities in inducing migration between cities; these may be man-made (e.g.,
shocks to the environment, judicial system, or transportation network) or natural (e.g., natural
disasters or weather). With independent and identically distributed amenity shocks, both
Gibrat’s and Zipf’s Law are satisfied.
None of this work seems readily extendible to countries. Cities and countries are
different phenomena in a number of different aspects. For one, countries have more control over
their policies and institutions than cities. Since many features of life and work are determined at

10

the national level, cities within a country are more similar than different countries. Mobility is
much higher between cities inside a country than it is between countries, so that theories in
which workers choose their city of residence seem inappropriate to countries. Externalities,
agglomeration effects, and amenity shocks that seem reasonable at a local level are less plausible
at the national level. It is challenging to use theories of city dispersion to explain country sizes.20
On the other hand, since the size distribution of cities and countries are similar, it is
natural to imagine that the same theory might explain both. One is left with the feeling that some
deeper theory is required to explain this empirical regularity. If my empirical findings are
corroborated, they constitute an intriguing puzzle for future theoretical work.

5. Conclusion
In this short paper, I have investigated the size distribution of countries’ population. I
have shown that it adheres reasonably well to Zipf’s law (size and rank are inversely linked), and
Gibrat’s law (population growth rates are uncorrelated with size). These features, and other
phenomena, are akin to more familiar characteristics of the size distribution of cities. Indeed,
this paper is easily summarized in Figure 6, which compares city and country features directly.
Cities and countries have similar size distributions. This resemblance naturally suggests
that a common explanation explains the size distribution of both cities and countries. But the
only theoretical work in this area has focused on rationalizing the size distribution of cities, and
models of the size distribution of cities do not seem easily applicable to countries. The common
empirical regularities of cities and countries pose an interesting riddle for economics.

More rigorously, if one ranks large cities by population size, S1>S2>…SN, then P(Size>S)≈αS-β where α is a
constant and β≈1.

Using the notation of note 1, I use OLS to estimate ln(i)=α+βln(Si)+εi where ε is a disturbance term hopefully
orthogonal to ln(S); Table 1 presents estimates of β.

This is especially true when the negative bias documented by Gabaix and Ioannides (2004) is taken into account.

The more conventional robust OLS standard error for the slope is .04.

These were generated with UN data from
http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/DYB2002/Table08.xls. Combining together cities from
different countries also delivers a Zipf slope coefficient of around -1, with or without country-specific fixed effects.
However, countries may measure cities in different ways, so pooling data for a joint Zipf regression is problematic.
I note in passing that it is hard to pool data in a meaningful way for a Zipf regression across cities and
countries because large countries are bigger than large cities, so the top end of the distribution is dominated by
countries. However, pooling together data from the American cities and sovereign countries depicted in Figure 6
delivers the Gibrat graph in Figure A7.

Nothing changes if the fifty largest cities in 2000 are considered.

The correspondence is imperfect for both criteria. Labor is mobile between countries over long periods of time.
Dependencies do not have a complete monopoly over legal coercion (though since mother countries rarely exercise
their rights, it is typically a de facto near-complete monopoly); neither do sovereign nation states (think of the
Korean or first Gulf wars).
14
Of course, the number of countries varies over time; Alesina and Spolaore (2003) provide more analysis.
15
Another issue is that countries (like cities) change physical size over time. Czechoslovakia, Ethiopia, Pakistan,
the USSR and Yugoslavia have split into multiple countries (and East Timor has split from Indonesia); the
Cameroons, Germanies, Yemens have merged (as has Tanzania). My WDI data use countries defined as of 2005, so
that e.g., they merge East and West Germany population for the period before unification in 1990. Dropping such
countries that have merged/split has little impact on the Zipf coefficients reported in Table 3 below.

Another analogue is Figure A2, which portrays Zipf’s law for country density, so that physical land area is
accounted for; the WDI provides country-specific land area data back through 1965. In 2000, the cross-country
correlation between the natural logarithms of population and land area was .84.
19
Both the Ukraine (the 25th largest country in 2004, with a population of almost 48 million) and Gabon (#150, 1.4
million) are marked.
20
Urbanization rates vary dramatically across countries, so that cities do not play comparable roles in different
countries. In 2000, the 90% range for the urbanization rate of the biggest 50 countries was (16%,88%), while the
50% range was (36%,76%); ranges for the entire set of countries are comparable.
