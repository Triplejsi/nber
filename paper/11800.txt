JEL No. C82, D24, E23
ABSTRACT
This paper presents new data on the sources of growth for the Japanese economy over the period
1960- 2000. The principal innovation is the incorporation of detailed information for individual
industries, including those involved in the production of computers, communications equipment, and
electronic components as information technology equipment. We show that economic growth is
dominated by investments and productivity growth in information technology, both for individual
industries and the economy as a whole. We also show that the revival of total factor productivity
growth accounts for the modest resurgence of the Japanese economy since 1995.

Introduction
Our objective in this paper is to quantify the sources of Japanese economic growth for 1960-2000,
using data for individual industries. Industry-level data enable us to trace the sources of Japanese
economic growth to its industry origins. A novel feature of these data is that we include the IT-producing
industries – Computers, Communications Equipment, and Electronic Components.1 We are able to assess
the relative importance of productivity growth and capital accumulation at both industry and economywide levels. We divide productivity growth between the IT and Non-IT sectors and allocate capital
accumulation between IT and Non-IT capital.
Productivity growth in the IT-producing industries has steadily risen in importance, generating a
relentless decline in the prices of information technology equipment and software.2 This decline in IT
prices is rooted in developments in technology that are widely understood by technologists and
economists, particularly the continuous improvement in the performance/price ratio of semiconductors
captured by Moore’s Law. Information technology has reduced the cost and improved the performance of
products and services embraced by businesses, households, and governments. The enhanced role of
investment in IT is a conspicuous feature of the Japanese economy and a growth revival is under way in
many important IT-using industries.
The mechanisms for diffusion of advances in IT are two-fold. First, advances in semiconductors
generate continuing price reductions for a given level of performance. These price reductions drive
demands for intermediate inputs in semiconductor-using industries such as computers, communications
equipment, and a host of others. Second, the industries that use semiconductors as inputs generate further
price declines that drive investments in IT equipment like computers and telecommunications equipment.
Advances in equipment production augment the downward pressure on prices, steadily redirecting the
rising IT investment flow toward its most productive uses.3
Our major goal is to characterize the role of information technology in the Japanese economy. We
also focus on the impact of IT during the long Japanese recession of the 1990’s. There are three main
challenges in isolating and analyzing the IT-producing industries in Japanese economy. The first is that
the IT-producing industries are below the two-digit industrial classification used in previous studies of
Japanese productivity, such as Jorgenson (1995), Nomura (2004a), and Fukao, Inui, Kawai, and
Miyagawa (2004). In this paper, we have generated detailed data for these industries in order to
characterize IT-production as precisely as possible. This enables us to quantify the impact of IT

production on the Japanese economy more accurately and represents a substantial advantage over earlier
studies using the broader industry aggregates.
The second challenge is the capitalization of investment in software in the Japanese national
accounts. The official national accounts treat expenditures for custom software, mineral exploration, and
plant engineering as gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) in intangible assets. Own-account software and
pre-packaged software have not been capitalized, although this is recommended by the United Nations
(1993) System of National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA). 4 In this paper, we capitalize own-account
software and pre-packaged software and rebalance the time-series of input-output tables given in Nomura
(2004b). The methodology is similar to the one adopted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in
the benchmark revision of the U.S. national accounts in 2003.
The third challenge is to construct appropriate prices for IT products. For example, Jorgenson
(2004) analyses the sources of growth of the G7 economies at the aggregate level. He uses
“internationally harmonized” IT prices based on U.S. prices. The use of harmonized prices is one possible
approximation to quality-adjusted prices for countries whose statistical agencies do not adjust IT prices to
eliminate quality change. However, the IT price statistics in Japan have already been quality-adjusted, so
that internationally harmonized prices are unnecessary. Nomura and Samuels (2004) compare Japanese
and U.S. IT prices and estimate the “best practice” IT prices for Japan that we employ in this paper. We
also consider Japanese IT prices for output and investment, since these are critical in measuring
productivity growth in Japanese industries, including IT-producing industries.
In addition to reconciling the national accounts for Japan with the 1993 SNA, we create a
production account for the household sector and expand the Japanese accounts in three areas. We impute
capital services for public capital, owner-occupied housing, and consumer durables. This makes it
possible to compare the Japanese national accounts with the U.S. national accounts described in
Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh (2005). The national accounting system employed in this paper includes a
complete production account for the Jorgenson system of national accounts (Fraumeni, 2000; Jorgenson
and Landefeld, 2005). This provides an appropriate valuation of capital services for fixed assets and land
in non-market production. This will be considered in the next revision of the SNA in 2008 (1993 SNA
Revision 1) or future revisions, as discussed in Ahmad (2004).

It is not evident why these categories of software were not capitalized. One reason might be that benchmark 1995
input-output (IO) table, one of basic sources for estimating the Japanese national accounts, treated only custom
software as a software investment. The benchmark 2000 input-output table, published in the summer of 2004, treats
pre-packaged software as GFCF. However, capitalization of own-account software was not included in the
benchmark 2000 IO table. Due to constraints on data from the Japanese national accounts, own-account and prepackaged software are not capitalized in previous studies of the Japanese growth accounts at the industry level, such
as Nomura (2004a) and Fukao, Inui, Kawai, and Miyagawa (2004).

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II presents our methodology for
measuring output and intermediate inputs. The most important feature is a consistent time series of interindustry transactions tables that enables us to allocate the sources of Japanese economic growth among
industries. In Section III we outline our methods for measuring capital input. Constant quality price
indexes for information technology equipment are essential for separating the change in performance of
this equipment from the change in price for a given level of performance. The cost of capital is the key
concept for capturing the economic impact of information technology prices. Section IV outlines our
methods for measuring labor input. These incorporate differences in hours worked and wages for workers
who differ in age, sex, and, most important, educational attainment. We combine measures of industry
output and capital, labor, and intermediate inputs to construct estimates of productivity by industry in
Section V.
In Section VI we outline a framework for aggregating output, capital, labor, and intermediate
inputs, and productivity over industries. This framework was introduced by Jorgenson, Gollop, and
Fraumeni (1987). A key role is played by a weighting scheme proposed by Domar (1961), based on the
relative importance of each industry in value added, as well as the relative importance of value added in
the industry’s output. The Domar weighting scheme captures the impact of sources of growth at the
industry level, both in the industry where growth occurs and the industries that purchase the output of this
industry. Section VII presents our analysis of the industry origins of Japanese economic growth over the
period 1960-2000. The contributions of capital and labor inputs and gains in economy-wide productivity
presented in Tables 2, 3, and 4 reflect the evolution of the production structure of all industries in the
Japanese economy. We aggregate over industries in order to show how changes in production structure at
the industry level cumulate to determine economy-wide economic growth. We focus special attention on
the role of productivity growth in the IT-producing industries. Section VII concludes the paper.

I. Measuring Output, Intermediate Input, and Value Added.
i. Methodology
This section describes our methodology for measuring industry outputs, intermediate inputs, and
value added. This uses a time series of input-output (IO) tables and was introduced by Jorgenson, Gollop,
and Fraumeni (1987, Ch.5). We begin with a description of our definitions and notation:

Yj

quantity of output of industry j

X i, j

quantity of input i into industry j

Xj

total intermediate input into industry j

3

Kj

capital input into industry j

Lj

labor input into industry j

Tj

index of technology in industry j

Yi C

quantity of domestically produced commodity i

Yi S

quantity of total supply of commodity i

M j ,i

Make matrix; nominal value of commodity i made by industry j

Vj

quantity of value added in industry j

PjY

price of output to producer in industry j

PjYT

price of output in industry j , including net indirect tax

Pi

price of commodity i

PjX

price of total intermediate input into industry j

PjK

price of total capital input into industry j

PjL

price of total labor input into industry j

PiYC

price of domestically produced commodity i

PjV

price of total value added in industry j

mi

quantity of imports of commodity i

Pi m

price of imported commodity i

We assume that the production function for industry j has M distinct intermediate inputs and is
separable in these inputs, so that:

(2.1)

Y j = f ( K j , L j , X j , T j );

X j = x ( X 1, j , X 2, j ,..., X M , j ) ,

where M =51; there are 47 commodities corresponding to the primary products of the industries listed in
Table 5 and 4 non-competitive import goods for Japanese economy –– Crude Oil, LNG, Iron Ore, and
Other Non-competitive Imports. The second equation of Equation (2.1) is an aggregator function of
intermediate inputs in industry j. Inputs of capital and labor, K j and L j , are also aggregated from the
detailed categories for each input defined below.

4

Under the assumptions of constant returns to scale and competitive markets, the value of output is
equal to the value of all inputs –– capital, labor, and intermediate:

(2.2)

PjY Y j = PjK K j + PjL L j + ∑ Pi X i , j ,
i

where we assume that the price of intermediate input Pi of commodity i is the same for all purchasing
industries.
In the aggregator function of Equation (2.1), we define the quantity of intermediate input as a
translog index of its components:

(2.3)

∆ ln X j = ∑ vi , j ∆ ln X i , j ,
i

where the vi , j weights are the average, two-period shares of the components in the value of intermediate
input. The price index of intermediate input PjX is equal to the value of intermediate input, divided by
the quantity index X j . Note that this price is specific to industry j, even if the prices of the component
inputs are the same for all industries, since the shares of the components differ among industries.
We require the concept of industry value added for aggregation over sectors in Section VI below.
Assuming that the production function is separable in intermediate input and value added, we define
industry value added V j implicitly from the equation:
(2.4)

∆ ln Y j = (1 − v Vj ) ∆ ln X j + v Vj ∆ ln V j ,

where the v Vj weights are the two-period average shares of value added in gross output. Value added in
nominal terms is PjV V j = PjK K j + PjL L j . The price of value added PjV is derived by dividing this
nominal value by the quantity index from Equation (2.4).
In order to identify the impact of information technology, we isolate the industries that produce
IT-related goods. In particular, we divide Electric Machinery into Computers, Electronic Components,
Communications Equipment, and Other Electrical Machinery. This breakdown allows us to better identify
and analyze the impact of IT-production on the Japanese economy. We derive both outputs and
intermediate inputs from a time series of inter-industry transactions tables. These tables consist of a Use
Table that allocates the use of each commodity among intermediate inputs and final demand categories
and a Make Table that allocates the output of each commodity among the industries that produce it. The
output of a given commodity by all industries and the input of this commodity by all industries must be
equal.
In the Use Table the jth column represents industry j and the ith row represents commodity i. In
nominal terms, the sum of the elements in column j is the value of the industry’s output. This is equal to
5

the value of this output to the producer, plus net indirect taxes paid on this output by the purchaser

TAX j :
PjYT Y j = PjY Y j + TAX j ,

(2.5)

where the price received by the seller is PjY and the price paid by the purchaser is PjYT , which includes
net indirect taxes and does not include trade and transportation margins paid by the purchaser.
An industry may produce several commodities and a commodity may be produced by several
industries. The value of the output of industry j is equal to the value of all the commodities it produces:

(2.6)

PjYT Y j = ∑ M j ,i ,
i

where M j ,i is the value of commodity i produced by j on Make table. This implies that:

(2.7)

PiYC Yi C = ∑ M j ,i ,
j

where Yi C denotes the quantity of domestically produced commodity i. We assume that each commodity
is an aggregate of the quantities produced in various industries and the output price of the jth industry

PjYT is given by:
(2.8)

ln PjYT = ∑
i

M j ,i

∑M

ln PiYC .
j ,i

j

The Use Table also includes sales to final demand. This is broken down into the familiar
categories of personal consumption expenditures, gross private domestic investment, government
purchases, exports, and imports (c,i,g,x,m). The sum of the elements in row i of the Use Table is the
value of all deliveries of the ith commodity to intermediate and final demand. Thus, the supply-demand
balance for commodity i in value terms is:
(2.9)

PiYC Yi C = ∑ Pi X i + Pi ( ci + ii + g i + xi ) − Pi m mi .
i

We can rewrite this as the total supply from domestic suppliers and imports, which equals total demand:
(2.10)

PiYC Yi C + Pi m mi = ∑ Pi X i + Pi ( ci + ii + g i + xi ) .
i

We assume that all buyers purchase the same basket of commodity i, that is, the same share of the
imported variety. The quantity of the total supply of commodity i, Yi S , is assumed to be a translog index
of the two varieties, and the price is defined to make the value identity hold:

6

(2.11)

∆ ln Yi S = viC ∆ ln Yi C + vim ∆ ln mi
Pi Yi S = PiYC Yi C + Pi m mi

.

Note that this price Pi is the price paid by producers for their input in Equation (2.2). This completes our
inter-industry accounting system.
ii. Data
We next describe the sources and methods for construction of our system of inter-industry
accounts. We extend the latest version of the time-series of input-output (IO) tables in the KEO Database.
This is a comprehensive productivity database for the Japanese economy produced at the Keio Economic
Observatory (KEO), Keio University, Japan. The official benchmark U.S. Input-Output (IO) tables
produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) are defined as Use Tables and transactions are
classified by commodity and industry. By contrast the Japanese benchmark IO tables published by
Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) classifies transactions commodity by
commodity. The IO tables (KEO-IO) in the KEO Database consist of Commodity Table, Make Table, and
Use Table. The Use Table is estimated using the other two tables, based on the commodity-technology
assumption that the same input coefficients are utilized for the production of a given commodity, even if
it has been produced by different industries.
The KEO-IO system has a 43-industry and 47-commodity classification, including noncompetitive imports during 1960-2000.5 The components of final demand in the KEO-IO are consistent
with the corresponding components of GDP in the Japanese official national accounts. However, since the
official Japanese national accounts based on 1993 SNA are estimated only back to 1980, it is impossible
to estimate long-term industry accounts based on 1993 SNA. Accordingly, the latest KEO-IO was
estimated on the basis of the 1968 SNA and adjusted for capitalization of custom software.
In this paper, we expand the KEO-IO in six major areas. By including capital consumption for
infrastructure our estimates become close to the official Japanese national accounts. Adding capitalization
of own-account and pre-packaged software, our concept approaches the 1993 SNA. Finally, additional
adjustments make our accounts comparable with the U.S. accounts based on the Jorgenson system of
national accounts (Fraumeni, 2000; Jorgenson and Landefeld, 2005). In 1993 SNA and also in the
National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) from the U.S. BEA, only consumption of fixed capital
(CFC) is included in the production accounts for government and household sectors. The CFC is only a

Although the documentation for the latest version of KEO Database estimated in 2003 is not yet published, Kuroda,
Shimpo, Nomura, and Kobayashi (1997) provides a detailed explanation of the estimation of time-series InputOutput tables for the Japanese economy. The methodology for estimating the latest KEO-IO is based on the same
approach.

part of the capital cost. The extension to the Jorgenson system of national accounts requires replacement
of the CFC by a proper measure of capital services in non-market production. This will be considered in
the next revision of SNA in 2008 (1993 SNA Revision 1) or future revisions as proposed by the Canberra
II Group (Ahmad, 2004).
iii. Issues
a) Identification of IT Producers
In order to identify the impact of IT on the Japanese economy, three IT producers –– Computers,
Communications Equipment, and Electronic Components –– are separated from Electric Machinery in the
KEO-IO during 1960-2000. In the US Standard Industrial Classification (SIC), Computers (SIC-357)
belong to Industrial Machinery and Equipment (SIC-35) at the two-digit level, but in Japan this industry
is included in Electric Machinery. In the SIC Computers (SIC-357) consists of Electronic Computers
(SIC-3571), Computer Storage Devices (SIC-3572), Computer Peripheral Equipment (SIC-3577),
Calculating And Accounting Machines (SIC-3578), and Office Machines (SIC-3579). Our definition of
the Computer Industry does not include SIC-3578 and 3579, both of which are included in General
Machinery.6
The Census of Manufacturing, produced by Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI),
and the benchmark IO tables for Japan give data for production and the components of value added in the
IT-producing industries. We develop a time series of data that is consistent with our industry definitions
at the three-digit level, since the industry classification of the source data changes over time. We estimate
the input columns of IT producers and Other Electrical Machinery using the RAS method. The sum is the
same as the input column of Electric Machinery industry in the original KEO-IO. We use the values for
exports and imports from the Trade Statistics of Japan by Ministry of Finance (MOF) to estimate the total
domestic demand for IT commodities. Maintaining consistency with the detailed fixed capital formation
matrixes estimated in Nomura (2004a, Ch.A-B), we distribute domestic demand, excluding investment,
among intermediate inputs and consumption and other final demands, based on shares in Benchmark IO
tables every five years. The row and column vectors aggregated from the four industries to Electric
Machinery industry are unchanged from the original KEO-IO. We discuss the issue of output prices for IT
producers in the next subsection.

6

The Computer industry in Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh (2005) is based on the SIC-357. In the North American
Industrial Classification (NAICS), large parts of SIC-3578 and SIC-3579 are excluded from Computer and
Electronic Product Manufacturing (NAICS-334) in the three-digit classification. These industries are included in
Machinery Manufacturing (NAICS-333) and other industries. To be consistent with the latest NAICS data, we
decided that the Computer Industry, excluding SIC-3578 and SIC-3579, is preferable in the Japanese accounts.

8

b) Consumption of Infrastructure
Based on the 1993 SNA, consumption of infrastructure is included in our IO tables, although the
original KEO-IO did not include it. The values of depreciation are estimated to be consistent with detailed
estimates of infrastructure stock during 1955-2000 in Nomura (2004a, Ch.2). This definition increases the
value added in government sector and government consumption in final demand. In the official Japanese
national accounts, consumption of infrastructure is already treated as one component of GDP. However, it
is estimated only from 1980 onwards and evaluated at historical prices. Since our estimates are in current
prices and differ from the values in the official national accounts, GDP also differs. Our estimate for the
additional consumption of infrastructure is 8.1 trillion yen in the year 2000.
c) Capitalization of Own-Account Software and Pre-packaged Software
In the Japanese national accounts, the expenditure for custom software is treated as GFCF.
Although 1993 SNA also recommends the capitalizing of own-account software and pre-packaged
software, the official Japanese national accounts do not follow this recommendation. In order to maintain
comparability of IT impacts between the U.S. and Japan, we capitalize these two types of software.
Nomura (2004b) estimates the investment and stock of own-account software by industry during 19552000, based on a methodology similar to the one BEA employed in the benchmark revision of the U.S.
national accounts in 2003. This requires rebalancing the IO tables.7
Since the output of the government sector is defined by total cost, capitalization of software leads
to a change in the definition of government output. The increase in the GDP is the sum of the increase of
investment for own-account and pre-packaged software, the increase of consumption for both types of
capital in the government sector, and the decrease of own-account software produced by the government
and pre-packaged software purchased by the government. The consumption of software capital is required
to be consistent with our estimates of the stock of software held by the government sector. By the
capitalization of both types of software, the GDP is increased by 3.8 trillion yen in 2000 in our estimates.
d) Capital Services of Public Capital
Consumption of public capital is already included in GDP in our IO table, based on the
recommendation of 1993 SNA. To maintain comparability with the Jorgenson system of national

7

Nomura (2004b) discusses the two different methods to describe own-account software in the IO table and achieve
consistency with other data. The production of own-account software within each industry is described as an output
of the software industry in our Use Table. Our labor data are not cross-classified by occupational categories.
Although the labor cost for programmers and system engineers producing own-account software in each industry is
deducted from the labor income, the aggregate index of wages in each industry is not be reflected in the
capitalization of own-account software.

9

accounts for the U.S., we impute the capital service costs for publicly owned capital, using the average
rate of return of all industries, weighted by the nominal share of capital stock in these industries. The rate
of return in each industry is defined by the weighted average of rate of interest and the rate of return on
equity, as measured in Nomura (2004a, Ch.3). This is based on the methodology of Jorgenson and Yun
(2001). The difference between the imputed public capital cost and CFC of public capital is defined as the
operating surplus of government sector.8 Again, this leads to a rebalancing our IO table, and an increase
of GDP. Our estimate for the additional capital cost for public capital is 8.4 trillion yen in 2000.
e) Capital Services of Owner-Occupied Housing by Households
We treat households as a producer in our accounting system. One of outputs of the household
sector is defined by the imputed rent for owner-occupied housing. Since the imputed rent of structures for
owner-occupied housing by households is included in national accounts, this change does not affect our
estimate of the GDP, although the description in our IO tables is changed accordingly.9 Note that the
output of Real Estate Industry is redefined to exclude the imputed cost of owner-occupied housing.
In 1993 SNA, land is defined as non-produced capital and income earned by renting of land is
defined as property income not presented in the production account. Although the rental fees observed in
the market may sometimes include the rental fees for land, the imputed rent for land is intentionally
excluded from the national accounts. In the U.S., on the other hand, the imputed rent for land is included
in the GDP. To maintain consistency between the national accounts in the two countries, we impute the
capital cost of land for residences owned by households. The imputed value is described as the operating
surplus of household sector as a producer and is added to GDP. In 2000, the increase of the GDP is 7.9
trillion yen.
f) Capital Services of Consumer Durables
In order to maintain comparability with the U.S. national accounts constructed by Jorgenson, Ho,
and Stiroh (2005) we treat households as a producer. The capital services from consumer durables are
defined as an output of the household sector. We estimate the stock of consumer durables for each
category of consumer durables and impute the capital service cost of the consumer durables, based on the
average rate of return of all industries. The expenditures on these durables are consistent with household
8

The estimated CFC for public capital is based on the value in the national accounts. In the Japanese national
accounts, CFC is defined by historical prices. The computed difference includes the capital cost, except CFC, and
the revaluation of CFC from historical to current prices. In our framework, CFC and operating surplus are added to
generate the cost of capital services.
9
The imputed rent in national accounts consists of the cost of capital and also intermediate inputs. Here we estimate
the capital costs from the imputed rent in national accounts. Second, we impute the rate of return for owneroccupied housing maintaining consistency with our estimates of capital cost and capital stock. The residual noncapital costs are described as intermediate inputs of the household sector in our accounts.

10

consumption in our IO table. This additional imputation leads to an increase of GDP. In 2000, it is 25.5
trillion yen and 4.6 percent share of our redefined GDP, based on the Jorgenson system. The share is
almost half of the U.S. share, which is 9.4 percent in 2000, reflecting the larger stock of consumer
durables and higher rate of return in the U.S.
iv. Output Prices for IT
International comparisons of productivity often employ internationally harmonized prices, which
translate U.S. prices to comparison-country prices in order to control for the quality improvements in the
comparison country.10 These studies treat the quality-adjusted computer prices constructed by BEA as the
most satisfactory for capturing the rapid technological improvements in the computer industry. Since
price statistics in comparison countries often do not adjust for quality change in IT goods, the use of
harmonized prices may be a useful approximation to quality-adjusted prices. However, price statistics in
Japan are already quality-adjusted.
The Bank of Japan (BOJ) produces the Corporate Goods Price Index (CGPI), a system which is
similar to the Producer Price Index (PPI) constructed by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). In the
BOJ’s 2000 benchmark revision, price statistics were vastly improved and the Wholesale Price Index
(WPI) was renamed as the CGPI. Here, we refer to both sets of statistics as the WPI/CGPI. Nomura and
Samuels (2004) have compared IT prices in the U.S. and Japan at the SIC three-, four-, and five-digit
levels. Comparing the U.S. and Japanese price data for Personal Computers and General Purpose
Computers & Servers at the five-digit level from 1995 to 2003, the gap between the two countries is not
large if the index numbers are constructed by aggregation over the most detailed items available.
By adjusting the index number formula and aggregation weights for the WPI/CGPI to be
consistent with the BEA’s output price, the resulting price declines for Electronic Computers are
comparable. During 1995-2003 prices fall 29.3 percent per year in the U.S., compared to 27.0 percent per
year in Japan. At the three-digit level the price of Electronic Computers and Peripheral Equipment falls
23.8 percent per year in the U.S. compared to 15.5 percent per year in Japan. A significant portion of the
price gap at the three-digit level can be explained by the Peripheral Equipment price, which falls less
rapidly in Japan and has a larger share of total output when exports are included. We conclude that

10

Price harmonization is an attempt to control for price differences under the assumption that the comparison
country's price data fails to capture quality improvements. The relative price of IT to non-IT in the comparison
country is set equal to the IT to non-IT price relative in the U.S. The harmonized price is formulated such that:
X
US
, where the suffix X means the reference country, p IT is the IT product
∆ ln p ITX = ∆ ln p nIT
+ ( ∆ ln p US
IT − ∆ ln p nIT )
price, and p nIT is the non-IT price.

11

computer prices at the SIC three-, four-, and five-digit level in the U.S. and Japan are appropriately
adjusted for quality change after 1995.
During 1980-95, computer prices based on BEA data at the three-digit level fall 13.1 percent per
year in the U.S., while prices fall 7.6 percent per year in Japan. In the 1980s the Japanese PC market was
dominated by the NEC Corporation, which had a 60-70 percent share of domestic demand. On the other
hand, the international PC market was very competitive with many manufacturers of IBM-compatible
computers entering in order to combat the dominance of IBM in the early 1980s. Until 1991, the Japanese
PC market was separated from the international market due to hardware and software differences and
incompatibility issues, but the introduction of DOS/V as a new Operating System (OS) in 1991 changed
that.
DOS/V is a version of MS-DOS that provides both English and Japanese language command
interfaces and can be used for applications designed for either or both English and Japanese. DOS/V
includes all the English-based commands and specific Japanese DOS/V commands.11 Because DOS/V
works on all IBM-compatible computers, foreign manufacturers were able to enter to the Japanese PC
market. Competition brought prices down for computers. In 1993, NEC Corporation introduced a new
model PC, priced 50 percent lower than the previous model. The import share of computers in Japan
increased from 7.6 percent in 1990 to 14.3 percent in 1995 and reached to 23.1 percent in 2000.
We conclude that internationally harmonized prices for computers are inappropriate for Japan,
since these prices fail to reflect differences in market conditions between Japan and the U.S. Nomura and
Samuels (2004) have estimated IT prices for the Japanese economy during 1960-2003, using the available
price data sources such as WPI/CGPI, Linked-IO Tables, Nikkei Data (prior to 1970), and others with the
adjustment of index number formulas and aggregation weights, where possible.12 These embody the best
practice for measuring IT prices for Japan and we have used them in this paper.
III. Measuring Capital Input
i. Methodology
This section outlines our methodology for measuring the flow of capital services in each industry.
The key objective is to account for substitution among assets with different marginal products. The
methodology was originated by Jorgenson and Griliches (1995), who constructed price and quantity

11

DOS/V gets its name because it requires a Video Graphics Array (VGA) display. In 1991 the Open Access
Development Group (OADG), a consortium organized by IBM, developed DOS/V.
12
Nikkei Data is a time series data covering real and nominal output, imports, and exports, based on the commodity
classification in the Japanese benchmark 1965 IO table. Output data covers 1951 to 1968 and import and export data
cover 1951 to 1972. These data was constructed at the Japan Center for Economic Research (JCER), directed by
Professor Iwao Ozaki, Keio University. Unfortunately, the documentation for these data is no longer available.

indexes for capital input, based on Jorgenson’s (1996) model of the corporate cost of capital. These
indexes were extended to the industry level for all three legal forms of organization – corporate, noncorporate, and household - by Jorgenson, Gollop, and Fraumeni (1987, Ch.4) and updated and revised by
Jorgenson (1995). We are unable to identify corporate and non-corporate capital services separately for
Japan because of data constraints.
Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh (2005) incorporate recent methodological advances by Jorgenson and
Stiroh (2000). These include the use of asset-specific revaluation terms in the service price equation. In
addition, capital service flows from new investments are assumed to become available in the middle of
the year, rather than at the end of the year, as in earlier work. In the measurement of capital in Japan
Nomura (1998) used asset-specific revaluation terms and Nomura (2004a, Ch.3) changed the timing of
capital service flows from new investments to be consistent with Jorgenson and Stiroh (2000), except for
buildings and structures.
We begin with notation for investment, capital stocks, and capital services for individual assets
and industry aggregates. The subscript k refers to the specific asset, while j refers to the industry; time
subscripts are suppressed wherever possible. For individual assets we have:

Ak , j

quantity of investment

Sk , j

quantity of capital stock

Zk, j

quantity of installed capital stock

Kk, j

quantity of capital service

PkA

price of investment, which is the same as price of capital stock for each k

PkK, j

price of capital service

VkK, j

nominal capital service cost

δk

geometric depreciation rate

For industry aggregates:

Aj

quantity index of industry investment

Zj

quantity index of industry installed capital stock

Kk

quantity index of industry capital service

PjA

price index of industry investment

PjZ

price index of industry stock

13

PjK

price index of industry capital service

Q Kj

index of industry capital quality

For each industry we begin with data on the quantity of investment in each individual asset Ak , j .
We assume that the investment price index transforms nominal investment in different time periods into
identical “efficiency units” over time, so that investments of different vintages are perfect substitutes in
production. Improvements in the performance of capital input, for example, a faster processor in a
computer, are incorporated into the price index that transforms the current vintage of investment into an
equivalent number of efficiency units of earlier vintages. As a concrete example, the constant-quality
price index for computer equipment transforms more recent investments in faster, more powerful,
computers into additional units of constant efficiency base-year computers.
We transform data on the quantities of investment into estimates of capital stocks for all assets,
industries, and years through the familiar perpetual inventory method. This is consistent with the
assumption of perfect substitutability across vintages and defines the capital stock for each industry and
asset as:
∞

(3.1)

S k , j ,t = S k , j ,t −1 (1 − δ k ) + Ak , j ,t = ∑ (1 − δ k )τ Ak , j ,t −τ ,
τ =0

where the efficiency of an asset is assumed to decline geometrically with age at the rate δ k . The
geometric approach makes it possible to simplify the perpetual inventory method, as in Equation (3.1).
Equation (3.1) has the interpretation that capital stock is a weighted sum of past investments,
where the weights are derived from the relative efficiencies of capital of different ages, captured by the
geometric rate of decline. Note that the rates of decline in efficiency δ k are indexed by asset only and not
by industry. Finally, because all capital is measured in base-year efficiency units, the appropriate price
for valuing the capital stock is the investment price deflator PkA .
Since investment Ak , j is defined in terms of progress in construction, the capital stock S k , j
defined in Equation (3.1) includes capital goods that are not yet installed. For each asset we assume that
new investment becomes available for production at the mid-point of the year so the installed capital
stock for each industry and each asset is assumed to the arithmetic average of the current and lagged
capital stock. An exception to this, considering the time lag between progress in construction and
installation, is that we assume the installed stock of buildings and structures is the lagged capital stock:
(3.2)

k ∈ Buildings, Structures

 S k , j ,t −1
Z k , j ,t = 
(S k , j ,t + S k , j ,t −1 ) 2

otherwise

14

.

The installed stock of capital Z k , j represents the accumulation of past investments, but we are
primarily interested in K k , j , the flow of capital services from that stock over a given period. This
distinction is not critical for individual assets, but becomes essential when we aggregate heterogeneous
assets to form an industry or economy-wide aggregate. We assume the flow of capital services for each
industry and each asset is proportional to the installed stock of capital:
(3.3)

K k , j ,t = φ k , j Z k , j ,t ,

where φ k , j denotes the proportionality constant. The constant coefficient: φ k , j , is an “annualization
factor”, which transform capital stock into capital services. Here, we normalize it to one; therefore, the
stock and services of capital are identical: K k , j = Z k , j .
We estimate a price of capital services that corresponds to the quantity of capital input via the
cost-of-capital formula. With no uncertainty about capital income, investors are indifferent between
earning a nominal rate of return it on a different investment or buying a unit of capital, collecting a rental
fee, and then selling the depreciated asset in the next period. For investors purchasing the asset the cost
of capital equals the marginal product of the asset. This implies the familiar cost of capital, or user cost,
for each asset in each industry:
(3.4)

PkK, j ,t = (i j ,t − π k ,t ) PkA,t −1 + δ k PkA,t ,

where the asset-specific capital gains term is π k .t = ( PkA,t − PkA,t −1 ) / PkA,t −1 and i j ,t is the nominal rate of
return in industry j.
The cost of capital accounts for the nominal rate of return, asset-specific depreciation, and assetspecific revaluation. An asset with a higher depreciation rate has a higher marginal product and must
receive a higher capital service price as compensation. Similarly, if an investor expects a capital loss
( π k ,t < 0 ), then a higher service price is required. Jorgenson and Stiroh (2000) and Oliner and Sichel
(2000) discuss the importance of incorporating asset-specific revaluation terms for information
technology assets experiencing rapid downward revaluations.
Tax considerations are also a key component of capital service prices, as discussed by Hall and
Jorgenson (1996) and developed in detail by Jorgenson and Yun (2001) for the U.S. economy and
Nomura (1998, 2004a) for the Japanese economy. We follow Nomura (2004a, Ch.3) in accounting for
capital consumption allowances, income allowances and reserves, special depreciation, corporate income
tax, business income tax, property taxes, acquisition taxes, debt/equity financing, and personal taxes. We
estimate an asset-specific, after-tax real rate of return for each asset in each industry, rk , j ,t , that enters the
cost-of-capital formula:
15

(3.5)

PkK, j ,t =

1 + (1 − τ t )τ kA,t − τ t zk ,t
rk , j ,t PkA,t −1 + δ k PkA,t + τ kP,t PkA,t ,
1−τt

[

]

where τ t is the rate for corporate income tax and business income tax, z k ,t is the present value of capital
consumption allowances for tax purposes, τ kA,t is a acquisition tax rate, τ kP,t is a property tax rate.13 The
rate of return rk , j ,t is formulated as a weighted average of real, after-tax returns to debt and equity. We
then assume the after-tax rate of return to all assets in each industry is the same and exhaust the value of
payments to capital across all assets in the corporate sector of each industry. Inventories and land have a
depreciation rate of zero and do not qualify for capital consumption allowances for tax purposes, so the
cost-of-capital formula in Equation (3.5) can be simplified for these assets.
Equations (3.1) through (3.5) describe our estimation procedure for the capital service flows and
capital service prices, K k , j and PkK, j , respectively, for each asset, industry, and time period. We combine
capital services for all assets within an industry by means of a translog quantity index as:
(3.6)

∆ ln K j = ∑ v kK, j ∆ ln K k , j
k

where the v kK, j weights are the two-period average shares of each type of capital income in total capital
income by each industry. The corresponding price index of capital inputs PjK is defined implicitly to
make the value identity hold:
(3.7)

V jK = PjK K j = ∑ PkK, j K k , j = ∑VkK, j .
k

k

Similarly, the price index for capital stock PjZ is defined implicitly by the identity:
(3.8)

PjZ Z j = ∑ PkA, j Z k , j .
k

We define capital quality Q Kj for industry j, as the ratio of capital input to capital stock:
(3.9)

Q Kj =

Kj
Zj

,

where:

13

The cost-of-capital formula is summarized here for simplicity. Nomura (2004a, Ch.3) develops a detailed cost-ofcapital formula based on the Japanese tax structure. In the Japanese tax system, a business income tax is levied on
revenue for some industries like electricity, although Equation (3.4) does not identify the differences. Since the use
of income allowances and reserves could reduce the effective tax rate for corporate income, a denominator of the
formula, (1 − τ t ) , depends on the rate of return. Also, z k ,t depends on the imputed rate of return, although Jorgenson
and Yun (2001) treat this as exogenous.

16

Z j = ∑ Zk, j

(3.10)

k

is the unweighted sum of each type of capital stock.

14

The translog index of capital input in the Equation (3.6) is a discrete approximation to the Divisia

type of capital income in total capital income. In comparison to the Divisia index of capital inputs, the
growth rate of capital stock in the Equation (3.10) is interpreted the weighted average of the growth rates

of capital stock by each asset;  Z j


 , where the weights w Z are the shares of each

  Z& j  , is the growth rate

−

 

of capital quality in Equation (3.9). Since the growth rates of capital inputs and capital stocks are the
same for each asset, the difference is the use of capital service costs versus capital stocks as weights;

(v

K kj . This implies that growth in capital quality reflects substitution towards assets

with relatively high service prices and high marginal products. For example, large depreciation rates and
rapid downward revaluations for computers imply that these assets have high marginal products, so that
their weights will be positive. The higher weights for computers imply that the substitution toward
computers makes capital input grow faster. This is captured by our index of capital quality.
Finally, we separate IT capital and Non-IT capital. The capital services of IT assets K IT
j include
the service flows from computer hardware, software, and communications equipment, while the Non-IT
includes the services from all other equipment, structures, inventories, and
capital service flow K nIT

land. We create sub-indexes of capital services as:

Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh (2005) define capital quality by the ratio of the translog index of capital inputs over the
translog index of capital stock. In this paper, we define the capital quality using the simple sum of capital stock as a
denominator, analogously with the definition of labor quality. Nomura (2004a, Ch.4) examines both indexes for
capital quality, the growth of capital quality using the simple sum of capital stock is higher than that with the
translog index of capital stock during 1960-2000 for the Japanese economy.

17

where the shares, v kIT, j and v knIT
, j , are those of IT capital and Non-IT capital, respectively.
ii. Data
Gross Capital Stock Private Enterprises (GCSPE), produced by Economic and Social Research
Institution (ESRI) of the Cabinet Office (CAO), is the main data source for the Japanese capital stock by
industry. However, the GCSPE is defined as gross capital stock and does not have an asset classification;
using this estimate of productive capital stock would result in biases. Nomura (2004a, Ch.2) shows that
the stock estimates of GCSPE may have an upward bias of 20 percent in 2000. This is due to the use of
the gross concept and the absence of consideration of quality change for heterogeneous capital. We
conclude that the official stock data are not sufficiently precise for our purposes.
Our investment data are based on the estimates of Nomura (2004a, Ch.A-B). He estimates a time
series of private and public fixed capital formation matrixes by 46 industries and 95 fixed assets during
1955-2000. The data sources are the benchmark Fixed Capital Formation Matrixes (IO-FCFM), which are
published by the MIC every five years after 1970 as one of supplementary tables of benchmark IO tables,
the Annual Report of Financial Statements of Corporations produced by the Ministry of Finance (MOF),
and many other primary data sources for investment, production, and trade in capital goods. 15 We
estimate stock matrixes for fixed assets, based on the best geometric approach for each fixed asset and a
perpetual inventory method, using the initial benchmark stock of the Japanese National Wealth Survey in
1955.
The stocks of inventories and land by industry are estimated in the Chapters C and D in Nomura
(2004a), respectively. In the Japanese economy, the value of land is particularly noteworthy. By
comparison with the 23.6 percent share of land in nominal capital stock in the U.S. in 2000, the Japanese
land share is 43.5 percent in 2000, even though the Japanese economy has experienced a record decline of
land prices in the 1990s. Diewert and Lawrence (2000) indicate that neglecting land and inventories leads
to a decline in average TFP growth rates of 0.1 percent per year in Canada. This is large in relative terms,
since the average growth rate for the Canadian TFP averaged only 0.5-0.6 percent per year during 19631996.
Nomura (2004a, Ch.4) shows that neglecting land and inventories for Japan leads to a decline of
0.7 percent per year in the average TFP growth rate during 1960-2000, compared to 1.5 percent annual
average growth rate for Japanese TFP. TFP growth is underestimated by a factor of almost fifty percent if
land and inventories are ignored! Land has a significant role in the measurement of capital and
productivity, especially in Japan. The clarification of the role of land as a capital input in production

The latest 2000 IO-FCFM became available after Nomura (2004a) was published. We have revised our capital
matrixes to incorporate the latest IO-FCFM.

18

account is one of the most significant aspects of Jorgenson system of national accounts. Probably due to
the definition of land as a non-produced capital input in the 1993 SNA, the cost of land has been
neglected in production analysis. The capital cost of land, however, is implicitly included in value added
in the production account. In addition, our accounting system in this paper is defined to include the capital
cost of land also for non-market production as well.
iii. Issues
Although the methodology described above conforms to the international standards recommended
by Blades (2001) and Schreyer (2001) of the OECD, there are important issues related to the availability
of data and the plausibility of certain assumptions that arise in implementing this methodology. This
subsection outlines these issues and presents our solutions.
g) Negative Service Prices
The intuition behind our estimation of capital service prices is that the value of capital service
flows must exhaust capital income. One problem is that there is very little income, or exceptionally large
negative capital income, in the periods of the oil shocks. This leads to negative estimates of service
prices. For example, if asset inflation rates are high and depreciation rates are low, relative to the
weighted average rate of return, negative service prices may result. This occurs especially in measuring
capital service prices for land during the period of the Japanese bubble economy in the late of 1980s,
since land is a non-depreciable asset. Economically, this is possible and suggests that ex post capital gains
are higher than expected, so that a small service price is possible in equilibrium. Empirically, however,
negative service prices make aggregation difficult so we have made adjustments for several assets. To
avoid the negative capital service prices, Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh (2005) and Nomura (1998) use a
smoothed inflation rate from the surrounding years rather than current inflation in the cost-of-capital
calculation. Berndt and Fuss (1986) and Diewert (2005) discuss this issue in more detail.
Bulow and Summers (1984) distinguish the “income risk”, which refers to uncertainty in future
capital incomes, and “capital risk”, which refers to uncertainty in future asset prices. In our framework of
measuring capital, although no income risk is assumed, Nomura (2004a, Ch-3) considers the difference of
capital risks among different assets to avoid negative capital service prices generated by ex post high
capital gains. The difference of risk premium of asset k from the risk premium of average asset in industry
j is assumed to be:
(3.12)

Rk , j =

σ kπ
(π k − π j ) ,
σ πj

19

where σ kπ is a standard deviation of the price change π k and σ πj is a standard deviation of π j , which is
the price change of average asset, defined later. In the Equation (3.12), price changes in assets are
regarded as surrogates for the rate of return on each asset.16 If it is assumed that there is no uncertainty
about the price change of asset k, σ kπ = 0 , and the risk premium for asset k is zero. Since the imputed
rate of return on equity includes the average risk premium for asset price uncertainty, the average of risk
premiums in each industry is assumed to be zero. If the price change of asset k is expected to be the same
as the price change of average asset in j industry: π k = π j , the risk premium for asset k is also zero.
To set the average of risk premium in any industry to zero, we assume π j is

where v kZ, j is a nominal share of asset k in industry j. Assuming that the weighted average of differences
in risk premia among assets is zero in each industry:

∑v

Rk , j = 0 . If the price variation of an asset is

relatively high and the capital gain is over that of the average asset, Rk , j is positive for the asset. The rate
of return rk , j in the Equation (3.5) is assumed to be rk , j + Rk , j . Considering the difference of capital risks
among assets can reduce the likelihood of negative capital service prices. As a last resort, we interpolate
the negative measured capital service prices, using the average price for capital services of all assets.
h) Capitalization of Software
As described in the previous section, the expenditures for own-account and pre-packaged
software are not capitalized in the official Japanese national accounts. We capitalize both types of
software in our accounts, based on the estimates in Nomura (2004b). Relative to the official GDP,
redefined to include the investment in three types of software, the share of total software investment is
2.03 percent in 2000, which is almost the same as the U.S. share of 2.07 percent. Including three types of
software, our capital stock matrixes consist of 102 assets: three types of inventory, four types of land, 90
tangible assets, and five intangible assets. These assets are listed in Table 1.
i) Capital for IT-Producing Industries
We are particularly interested in IT-producing industries, but Nomura (2004a) provides insufficient
detail. We estimate investment of Computers, Communications Equipment, and Electronic Components
16

Although it is possible to consider different formulations for capital risk, we assume that the set of Equations
(3.12)

20

industries using two main data sources. The IO-FCFM gives the asset composition of investment every
five years from 1970 to 2000. The Census of Manufacturing produced by the Ministry of Economy, Trade,
and Industry (METI) gives annual data for acquisition of two types of assets and the possession of land
and inventories for the IT-producing industries. Maintaining consistency with capital formation matrixes
estimated in Nomura (2004a), we expand our fixed capital formation and stock matrixes during 19552000 to include the IT-producing industries.
j) Infrastructure as a Sector Holds Capital
One of the most substantial differences between the U.S. capital data described in Jorgenson, Ho,
and Stiroh (2005) and Japanese capital data is the treatment of infrastructure as a sector. In Japan,
infrastructure sectors are identified separately from other government activities. Nomura (2004a)’s capital
matrix has 23 classes of infrastructure investment. By expanding to IT-producing industries, our capital
matrixes have 70 capital-holding sectors in total; 45 industries, general government, excluding other
identified infrastructure, and households, which hold housing and consumer durables. Identification in
government-owned capital makes it possible to compute CFC and the service cost of government capital
as precisely as possible.
k) Deflators for IT capital assets
Jorgenson and Stiroh (2000) argued that the official deflators, especially for software and
communications equipment, do not fully account for quality change. In the U.S. the price index for ownaccount software was defined by the BEA's input cost index, consisting of labor compensation cost
indexes and an intermediate inputs cost index. For custom software, the price index was defined as a
weighted average of the price indexes for own-account software and pre-packaged software, where the
weights are arbitrarily selected as 75 percent for own-account software and 25 percent for pre-packaged
software (Parker and Grimm, 2000). In the 2003 revision by the BEA, both price indexes for custom
software and own-account software are defined by a weighted average of the input cost index with the
NIPA pre-packaged software price index, which is estimated holding the quality constant.17
In Japan, a satisfactory estimate of the constant-quality price for pre-packaged software is not
available.18 The price for custom software estimated by the BOJ after 1995 from the Corporate Service
Price Index (CSPI), is based on labor cost. The official Japanese national accounts also use this price
index and extend it backward to 1980. Nomura (2004b) extends this cost index backward to 1955, based
on a similar method. In Japan, the share of pre-packaged software in total software investment is slightly

and (3.13) holds.
17
See Grimm, Moulton, and Wasshausen (2005).
18
BOJ began to estimate the price for pre-packaged software in their CSPI after 2000, although it is based on the
cost evaluation method.

21

less than 6.2 percent in 2000, based on Nomura (2004b), by comparison with 28.0 percent in the U.S. We
use same deflator as that of the Japanese national accounts for the three kinds of software.19
For IT capital goods, computers and communications equipment, we use the investment prices
estimated in Nomura and Samuels (2004). These price indexes are based on import shares and import
prices, trade margins, transportation costs, and the “best practice” output prices mentioned in the previous
section. The rates of decline in the IT investment prices are smaller than in the IT output prices, reflecting
the more moderate movements in prices for wholesale trade and transportation.
l) Depreciation Rates
Many studies of the Japanese economy use the depreciation rates of the BEA (Fraumeni, 1997).
However, depreciation rates can differ between the U.S. and Japan, reflecting differences in natural and
environmental conditions, as well as utilization, maintenance, and composition of capital goods. Nomura
(2004a, Ch-2) estimates depreciation rates based on a Box-Cox transformed age-price profile, using data
in the second-hand market for motor vehicles, and an age-efficiency profile using data in the rental
markets for housing in Japan. The geometric approach is accepted as an approximation for these assets.
The estimated geometric depreciation rates are 16.3 percent for passenger motor vehicles, 22.423.8 percent for trucks, and 3.1-4.8 percent for housing. By comparison with the U.S. depreciation rates
in the BEA, passenger vehicles and housing are less durable and trucks are more durable in Japan. In this
paper we use these estimates. For other assets, we estimate average service lives T based on the Japanese
tax-lives and the arbitrary rates converted to effective service-life in each fixed asset. Based on the
relationship: δ = R T , we compute the Japanese depreciation rates using the declining balance rates R
originated by Hulten-Wykoff (1981) and employed by the BEA.
The BEA depreciation rates currently incorporate Oliner’s (1993, 1994) estimates for all
computer components except personal computers. Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh (2005) use 31.5 percent for
computers based on the depreciation schedule of the BEA. In Japan, the tax-life is four years for personal
computers and five years for other computers, which are abridged from six years after the 2001 fiscal year.
Based on the tax lives, we assume 34.7 percent depreciation rate for computers in Japan. The depreciation
rates for all assets in this paper are presented in Table 1.

19

In order to check the sensitivity of the change of software prices, Nomura (2004b) estimates a harmonized price
index for pre-packaged software, based on the cost indexes in the U.S. and Japan and the NIPA pre-packaged
software price index. When the BEA definition of prices for own-account software and custom software is applied,
the growth rate of total software stock in Japan is 8.3 percent during 1995-2000, by comparison with 6.3 percent for
the prices defined by the cost index. Although our estimates may understate the growth of capital inputs and outputs
as final demands of software, we have chosen to employ the cost index.

II. Measuring Labor Input
i. Methodology
Our methodology for deriving labor input was introduced by Jorgenson and Griliches (1995),
who constructed an index number of aggregate labor input, based on labor compensation data for male
workers, classified by educational attainment. This was extended to the industry level for the U.S.
economy by Jorgenson, Gollop, and Fraumeni (1987, Ch.3). and greatly disaggregated by age, sex,
occupation, class of employment, as well as educational attainment. In this section we describe the
construction of labor input indexes by industry for Japan.
To construct a measure of labor input that accounts for heterogeneity in hours worked, we now

describe our implementation, beginning with the notation.

saecj subscripts for sex, age, education, class, industry
Esaecj

employment matrix, number of workers in cell s,a,e,c,j

H l, j

Ll , j

Pl ,Lj

Vl ,Lj

We express the industry volume of labor input as a translog quantity index of the individual
components:
(4.1)

∆ ln L j = ∑ vlL, j ∆ ln Ll , j ,
l

where the vlL, j weights are the two-period average share of each type of labor income in total labor income
by each industry. To quantify the impact of substitution among different types of labor input, we assume
that labor input for each category Ll , j is proportional to hours worked H l , j :
(4.2)

Ll , j = ϕ l , j H l , j ,

where the constants of proportionality ϕ l , j transform hours worked into flows of labor services. We
assume that labor services are the same at all points of time for each category of hours worked. For
example, an hour worked by a self-employed male worker, aged 34, with four years of college education,
represents the same labor input in 1977 as in 2000.

23

Under assumption Equation (4.2) the labor quantity index in Equation (4.1) is expressed in terms
of hours worked:
(4.3)

∆ ln L j = ∑ vlL, j ∆ ln H l , j .
l

Observations on the constants ϕ l , j are not required to define aggregate labor input. The corresponding
price of labor input PjL is the ratio of the value of labor compensation to the volume index. The total
value is simply:
(4.4)

V jL = PjL L j = ∑ Pl ,Lj Ll , j = ∑Vl ,Lj .
l

l

Finally, the labor quality index measures the contribution of substitution among the components
of labor input to the volume obtained from a given number of hours:
(4.5)

Lj

Q Lj =

Hj

,

where:
(4.6)

H j = ∑ Hl, j
l

is the unweighted sum of each type of hours worked. The definition of labor quality in Equation (4.5) is
similar to the definition of capital quality in Equation (3.9).
ii. Data
We use the labor data in the KEO Database, described in Kuroda, Shimpo, Nomura, and
Kobayashi (1997, Ch.4) for the period 1960-1992, and extend these data to 2000. The KEO Database
classifies workers by sex, age (eleven classes), educational attainment (four classes for males, three
classes for females), employment class (three types: employees, self-employed, and unpaid family
workers), and industry.20 There is a total of (11 x 4 x 3) +(11 x 3 x 3) = 231 types of workers for each of
43 industries: in total 231*43=9,933 cells.
The data source for estimating the employment matrix is the Population Census of Japan,
Statistics Bureau, MIC, for benchmark years in every five years from 1960 to 2000.21 The Labour Force
Survey (LFS) by MIC, Census of Manufacturing by METI, and many other primary data sources are used
to interpolate between the benchmark years. Although a multiple jobholder is counted as one in the
Population Census, the Employed Persons Employees and Hours Worked classified by Economic
20

The age classes consist of 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-. Classes of
education attainment are 1) less than high school degree, 2) high school degree, 3) professional school, and 4)
college degree and above for males, and 1), 2), and 3)+4) for females. Before 1980, the education attainment of
females is split into just two classes: 1) and 2)+3)+4). Those attending but not completing universities are in 2).

24

Activities, a supporting table in the Japanese National Accounts, counts the workers in multiple jobs. Our
estimated employment matrix is converted to this concept.
The Basic Survey on Wage Structure, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), is the
data source for estimating average hours and wages for employees. To complement the information for
some industries and categories, the Monthly Labour Survey by MHLW, the Census of Manufacturing, the
LFS, and some other primary data are used. For self-employed and unpaid family workers, the LFS gives
average hours. Wage rates of self-employed and unpaid family workers are imputed from data available
for select industries to yield an estimate of labor compensation for the self-employed group. The wage
differential between the self-employed and unpaid family workers is estimated to be the same as the
differential between full-time and part-time employees.22
Total labor compensation by industry has to be consistent with the input-output table. The
adjustment coefficients are computed from the discrepancy between the labor data and the KDB-IO. We
maintain consistency at the industry level by adjusting average hours worked. The KEO Database does
not have labor input for the separate industry categories for IT producers. In this paper, we estimate the
average wages for IT-producing industries, based on the Census of Manufacturing. We estimate timeseries wage indexes p Lj for three IT-producing industries and Other Electric Machinery during 19602000. The labor quality indexes for the four industries are assumed to be identical.

III. Measuring Industry Productivity
i. Methodology
We next examine the sources of Japanese economic growth at the industry level. The
contributions of capital and labor inputs and gains in aggregate total factor productivity ultimately reflect
the evolution of the production structure at the industry level and it is critical to examine the component
industries. Changes in this production structure cumulate into the determinants of economic growth as
technologies evolve and prices and economic incentives are altered accordingly.
Our methodology for measuring total factor productivity at the industry level begins with an
industry production function:
(5.1)

Y j = f (K j , L j , X j , Tj ) ,

21

The Population Census is available every five years, except 1945, from 1920.
Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh (2005) assume that the hourly wage of the self-employed and unpaid family workers
equals the hourly wage of the employed. Estimates of hours worked, multiplied by the wage for the same category
of employed worker, yields an estimate of labor compensation for the self-employed and unpaid family workers.

22

25

where Y j is industry output23, K j is capital input, L j is labor input, and X j is intermediate input, and

T j as an indicator of efficiency, all for industry j. The variables K j , L j , and X j are each aggregates of
the many components described in the preceding sections and the production function Equation (5.1) is
assumed to be separable in these components, based on the Leontief-Sono aggregation theorem.
Let PjY , PjK , PjL , and PjX denote the prices for outputs and the three inputs, respectively.
Under the assumptions of constant returns to scale and competitive markets, a translog index of total
factor productivity (TFP) growth is defined as:

vT , j ≡ ∆ ln Y j − v jK ∆ ln K j − v jL ∆ ln L j − v jX ∆ ln X j ,

(5.2)

where v ij (i ∈ K , L, X ) is the two-period average share of the input in the value of output. Note that the
value of output is equal to the sum of outlays on all inputs, so that PjY Y j = PjK K j + PjL L j + PjX X j and
the value shares sum to one.24
Equation (2.4) provides an alternative definition in terms of value added:
(5.3)

vT , j ≡ v Vj ∆ ln V j − v jK ∆ ln K j − v jL ∆ ln L j .

While useful for aggregation purposes, this definition fails to identify the role of intermediate inputs, such
as semiconductors used in producing computers and communications equipment. The definition of
industry-level total factor productivity growth in Equation (5.2) is more useful for this purpose and will
be employed in our study of the growth of individual industries.
Under the same assumptions as in Equation (5.2), we decompose industry labor productivity
growth, or growth of output per hour worked, as:
(5.4)

∆ ln y j = v jK ∆ ln k j + v jL ∆ ln Q Lj + v jX ∆ ln x j + vT , j ,

where lower-case letters refer to output and inputs per hour worked. The terms on the right-hand side are
the contributions of capital deepening, labor quality, intermediate input deepening, and TFP growth to
growth of labor productivity, respectively. We refer to Equation (5.2) as TFP growth or productivity
growth, and Equation (5.4) as average labor productivity (ALP) growth.

23

We refer to this simply as “output” although the term “gross output” is sometimes used to distinguish this measure
from “value added”.
24
See Hall (1988), Basu and Fernald (1995, 1997), and Basu, Fernald, and Shapiro (2001) for alternative
assumptions and their implications.

26

IV. Aggregation Over Industries
i. Methodology
To examine the Japanese economy as a whole, we next aggregate across industries. We define the
production possibility frontier as the efficient combination of outputs and inputs for the economy as a
whole. Value added, V, consists of value added from all j industries and is produced from primary inputs
and technology as:
(6.1)

V (V1 ,...V J ) = f ( K , L, T ) ,

where V, K, and L are aggregate value added, capital services, and labor input, respectively.
The production possibility frontier does not impose the assumption of perfect substitution of
value added between industries required for the existence of an aggregate production function. We define
value added as a translog index over industry value added:
(6.2)

∆ ln V = ∑ w Vj ∆ ln V j ,
j

where w Vj is the two-period average share of industry value added in aggregate value added and V j is
from Equation (2.4).
Aggregate capital and labor inputs are defined as translog indexes of all types of capital and
labor, respectively:

∆ ln K = ∑ wkK, j ∆ ln K k , j
(6.3)

k, j

∆ ln L = ∑ wlL, j ∆ ln Ll , j

,

l, j

where the weights, wkK, j and wlL, j , are the two-period average share of each type and each industry of
capital or labor input in total capital or labor input. P V , P K , and P L are the corresponding price
indexes for aggregate value added, capital, and labor, respectively, to make the value identity

PV V = P K K + P L L .
We define aggregate quality indexes for capital and labor:
(6.4)
where Z =

∑

k, j

QK =

K L L
,Q = ,
Z
H

Z k , j and H = ∑l , j H l , j . The quality indexes of capital and labor, defined by industry

in Equation (3.9) and (4.5), respectively, represent the composition of capital and labor inputs within each
industry. Next, we define the quality indexes for reallocation of capital and labor inputs by industry:

27

QkKA =

Kk
L
, QlLA = l ,
Zk
Hl

where Z k =

∑

j

Z k , j and H l = ∑ j H l , j . K k and Ll are the translog quantity indexes of capital and

labor, defined by ∆ ln K k =

∑

j

w jK,k ∆ ln K k , j and ∆ ln Ll = ∑ j w jL,l ∆ ln Ll , j .

The growth of aggregate capital and labor inputs in Equation (6.3) can be rewritten using the
quality indexes,
(6.5)

∆ ln K = ∆ ln Z + ∆ ln Q K = ∆ ln Z + ∆ ln Q KI + ∆ ln Q KA + ∆ ln Q KO
∆ ln L = ∆ ln H + ∆ ln Q L = ∆ ln H + ∆ ln Q LI + ∆ ln Q LA + ∆ ln Q LO

,

where:

Q KI = ∑ w jK Q Kj , Q LI = ∑ w jLQ Lj
(6.6)

j

Q

KA

j

= ∑ w Q ,Q
K
k

k

KA
k

LA

= ∑ wlLQlLA

.

l

where Q KI and Q LI are aggregate measures for quality of capital and labor, defined in Equation (3.9) and
Equation (4.5), respectively. Also, Q KA and Q LA are aggregate measures for reallocation of capital and
labor among industries defined in Equations (6.5) for each category of capital and labor. Total quality
indexes for capital and labor are the sums of Q iI , Q iA , and Q iO ( i ∈ K , L ), which are cross-effects by
industry and category and defined as the residuals in Equation (6.6).
We then define aggregate TFP growth as:
(6.7)

vT ≡ ∆ ln V − v K ∆ ln K − v L ∆ ln L ,

where the shares, v K and v L , are the two-period average shares of the inputs in aggregate value added.
As above, we can estimate the sources of aggregate labor productivity, or value added per hour worked,
as:
(6.8)

∆ ln v ≡ v K ∆ ln k + v L ∆ ln Q L + vT ,

where the definition of the determinants is the same as for industries, except that there is no intermediate
input component.
Aggregate TFP growth in Equation (6.8) is also defined as the sum of “Domar-weighted” industry
rates of TFP growth. If we multiply industry productivity growth in Equation (5.3) by the industry share
of aggregate value added w Vj , divide through by the industry share of value added in output v Vj , and sum
across all industries, this yields:

28

(6.9)

vT = ∑
j

w Vj
v Vj

vT , j .

The ratio of the two proportions – the so-called Domar weight – captures both the relative
importance of the industry in value added for the economy as a whole and the relative importance of
value added in the industry’s output.25 The numerator is the proportion of each industry’s value added in
aggregate value added. The denominator is the proportion of value added in the industry’s output. Note
that the sum of the Domar weights exceeds unity and that the industry sum of Domar weights is the
inverse of the ratio of value added to gross output at the aggregate level. This ingenious weighting
scheme, originated by Domar (1961), plays a key role in our framework for aggregation over industries.
An important feature of our methodology is that we are able to identify the contributions of
individual industries to aggregate economic growth. This includes both the direct contribution to value
added and the flows of goods and services among industries as intermediate inputs in the inter-industry
transactions tables. Triplett (1996), for example, has quantified the role of semiconductors as an input into
the computer industry. Under plausible assumptions, falling semiconductor prices account for essentially
all of the price decline in computers. Building on this observation, Oliner and Sichel (2000) have
constructed a model of the U.S. economy with three industries – computers, semiconductors, and all other
products.
An alternative aggregation methodology, employed by Jorgenson, Gollop, Fraumeni (1987, Ch.
9), is based on an aggregate production function. Here, the price of a unit of value added must be the
same in all industries in order to reduce the production possibility frontier to an aggregate production
function. Under this assumption, value added from the aggregate production function, V * , is defined as a
simple sum across industries:
(6.10)

V * = ∑V j .
j

Based on V * , Z , and H , we define a measure of TFP growth at the aggregate production
function approach as:
(6.11)

vT* ≡ ∆ ln V * − v K ∆ ln Z − v L ∆ ln H .

25

Our approach to defining aggregate TFP growth is based on the production possibility frontier introduced as
“aggregation over industries” in Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh (2005). Their aggregate TFP growth is almost equivalent
with ( vT

+ Q KA + Q LA ) in this paper.
29

Substituting Equations (6.6) and (6.12) to Equation (6.8), aggregate TFP growth vT is
decomposed to vT* , the three components of quality change in capital and labor inputs, and the
reallocation of value added Q VA :
(6.12)

vT = vT* + Q VA − v K (Q KI + Q KA + Q KO ) − v L (Q LI + Q LA + Q LO ).

where
(6.13)

Q VA =

V
V*

.

This decomposition shows that TFP for an aggregate production function: vT* , has three allocation biases
of value added, capital, and labor, two quality change biases of capital and labor, and two other
aggregation biases.

V. Empirical Results
i. Growth in IT Production
Table 2 represents growth in aggregate value added and its sources. Aggregate value added is
defined by real gross domestic product at factor cost, separately for IT manufacturing industries ––
Computers, Communications Equipment, and Electronic Components –– Non-IT manufacturing, and
Non-manufacturing. During 1960-1973, the contribution of IT manufacturing is only 0.23 percent in 9.89
percent growth rate of aggregate value added. The contribution expands to 0.31 during 1973-1990. After
the bursting of the bubble economy, value added growth declines rapidly in the Japanese economy. The
contribution of IT manufacturing is only 0.15 percent during 1990-1995.
Since 1995, however, IT manufacturing has contributed 0.41 percent to aggregate value added. IT
manufacturing revives relative to other industries, so that almost one third of the growth in aggregate
value added is generated by the growth of IT manufacturing in the late 1990s. Resurgence of three IT
manufacturing industries after 1995 is shown in Figures 1 and 2; Figure 1 is value added growth and the
industry contribution to aggregate value added during 1995-2000 and Figure 2 is the difference between
the growth rate and the industry contribution from the early 1990s to the late 1990s. In the late 1990s, the
three IT manufacturing industries have the highest growth of value added in our forty-seven sectors.
Communications Equipment, especially, shows the largest improvement –– almost 30 percent of value
added growth. Also, the growth of the Computer industry improves by more than 20 percent.
(Insert Figure 1 and Figure 2)

30

Gross and net output growth by industry is given in Tables 7 and 8. The high growth rate of IT
manufacturing is very persistent. During the periods 1960-2000, the three IT manufacturing industries
have the highest rates of value added growth. However, the value added share of three IT industries is
small, even in 2000. Table 5 presents value added shares by industry in 1960, 1973, 1990, 1995, and 2000.
The value added share of the three IT manufacturing industries is only 1.83 percent in 2000. The relative
importance of IT manufacturing in value added in the U.S. is similar. Based on Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh
(2005), the share of value added of the three IT manufacturing industries is 1.62 percent in 2000.
In 1960, the largest industry in terms of value added is Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishery. This
industry has a 12.96 percent share of value added. The relative importance rapidly declines to 5.50
percent in 1970 and only 1.35 percent in 2000. By contrast service industries, defined as a sum of
industries 30-45, gradually expand from 36.50 percent to 50.39 percent of total value added from 1960 to
2000. Clearly, the Japanese industry structure shifts toward service industries in this period. Among
manufacturing industries, the largest industry is Iron and Steel in 1960. Although this industry occupied
3.32 percent in 1960, the share decreases to 1.08 percent in 2000. Only six manufacturing industries ––
three IT manufacturing industries, Other Electric Machinery, Printing and Publishing, and Other
Manufacturing–– expand in relative importance in value added for the economy as a whole.
Within IT manufacturing, the Computers industry expands in importance until the end of the
1980s. From the beginning of the 1990s, when the Japanese personal computer market became
internationally competitive, the value added contribution of Computers within IT manufacturing
decreases, as shown in Table 2. On the other hand, the Electronic Components industry has expanded in
importance. In the U.S. the Electronic Components industry also has the largest share of three IT
manufacturing industries –– 49.91 percent in 2000. Relative to the U.S., however, Electronic Components
industry is more significant in Japanese IT manufacturing. In 2000, 72.94 percent of value added in IT
manufacturing is generated by Electronic Components industry. In comparisons between the U.S. and
Japan, the difference in the composition of IT manufacturing should be noted.
ii. IT and Non-IT Capital
The contribution to the economic growth of IT capital, about 0.2 percent annually from the 1960s
to the middle of the 1990s, is shown in Table 2. After 1995 the IT capital contribution increased by a
factor of two. Figure 3 represents the contribution of IT capital to total capital input for the economy as a
whole. In the 1980s, IT capital contributes 31.89 percent of the growth of total capital inputs in the U.S.,
as measured by Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh (2005), but only 13.52 percent in Japan. Since 1995, the
Japanese economy has rapidly shifted its capital allocation from Non-IT capital to IT capital. In 2000, the
contribution of the IT capital rose to 42.47 percent, approaching the 46.04 percent in the U.S.
31

(Insert Figure 3)
In the 1990s, Japanese economic growth depends mainly on the growth of capital input; by
contrast labor input actually decreases. The contribution of Non-IT capital is 1.68 percent annually in the
early 1990s and decreases to less than half that in the late 1990s. Accelerated growth of IT capital input,
especially Computers, partly compensates for the decrease. The contribution of Computers, which
includes software embedded in the computer hardware, is 0.22 percent. The contribution of computer
software – Custom, Pre-packaged, and Own-Account Software – also expands to 0.10 percent in this
period.
In the U.S. the impacts of IT capital on U.S. economic growth in the late 1990s led to a
resurgence of U.S. economic growth. In examining the impact of IT capital in Japan, the differences
between the U.S. and Japan must be recognized. Table 10 gives growth rates of capital input by industry.
From the early 1990s to the late 1990s, the growth of the capital input falls in most of the Japanese
industries, while capital input expands in most U.S. industries. In other words, the impact of IT capital in
the U.S. is enhanced by the economy-wide expansion of the U.S. economy in the late 1990s. The surge of
investment in IT capital in Japan took place during a lengthy recession. The financial sector was
immobilized by holdings of worthless assets, the non-financial corporate sector was restructuring its
business in order to deal with the decline in demand and intensified international competition, and the
household sector confronted the imbalance between the depreciated value and the financial liability in
residences purchased during the bubble economy in the late 1980s.
The annual growth rate of IT capital input in Japan is a surprisingly 11.26 percent in the late
1990s, as shown in Table 2. The growth rate in Japan is much lower than the 19.28 percent growth in the
U.S., measured by Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh (2005). However, the growth of IT capital in Japan had a
very significant role in growth, since Non-IT capital in Japan expands by only 1.87 percent in this period,
relative to the 3.09 percent in the U.S. We conclude that, despite the long economic recession in Japan,
the rapid technological progress in the IT-producing industries diffuses through the production system
through capital accumulation in the IT-using industries.
Growth rates in IT capital and Non-IT capital by industry are presented in Tables 11 and 12,
respectively. Although growth in the capital input decreases in most industries from the early 1990s to the
late 1990s, the growth of IT capital input increases. In almost all industries, except for Metal Products and
Electricity, the growth of IT capital is greater than the growth of Non-IT capital. The Household sector
has the highest growth of IT capital input, over 25 percent during 1995-2000, due to the expansion in
personal computers and cellular phones as consumer durables. Eight service industries, including Finance
32

and Insurance, Railroad Transportation, and Medical Care, expand the input of IT capital by more than 10
percent annually.
Tables 13 and 14 represent industry contributions to IT and Non-IT capital input for the economy
as a whole. The sum of contributions to IT capital for the manufacturing industries is 1.03 percent in the
late 1990s, only 9.18 percent of IT capital expansion. Service industries are most important for both IT
and Non-IT capital. The Finance and Insurance industry is one of the largest contributors to IT capital
expansion, but this industry does not contribute to Non-IT capital at all. On the other hand, the Household
sector contributes only 0.17 percent to the growth of IT capital during 1960-1973, although this sector has
the highest contribution of Non-IT capital in this period. Capital allocation among assets has gradually
shifted toward the Household sector. In the late 1990s, this sector’s contribution to IT capital is 1.88
percent.
Although manufacturing industries are not the main contributors to IT capital, some
manufacturing industries are highly IT-capital-intensive. Table 15 gives the shares of IT capital in total
capital cost by industry. The most IT-capital-intensive industry is Computers with a share of IT-capital
cost of 46.86 percent in 2000. Figure 4 shows the capital cost structure in four highest IT-capital-intensive
industries in 2000. Computer software has the largest share in IT capital in the Computers industry.26
Communications Equipment has the largest share of capital cost in the Communications industry, where
the cost of IT capital is 40.22 percent of the total. Finance and Insurance has a 34.45 percent share of IT
capital cost, of which 16.94 percent is the capital cost of Computers. The rate of technological progress is
not uniform among different types of IT capital, so that different rates of progress have been incorporated
into the production system, depending on the capital structure in each industry.
(Insert Figure 4)
Table 2 represents the contributions of capital and labor inputs to the growth of value added at the
economy-wide level. During 1960-2000, the contribution of capital input is 3.05 percent annually, so that
the growth of capital inputs explains 56.81 percent of the Japanese economic growth. The role of capital
in Japan is very similar to that in the U.S., where capital input contributes 56.49 percent during 19772000. This estimate by Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh (2005) is based on similar accounting concepts. As
pointed out by Nomura (2004a), the difference in sources of long-term economic growth in the U.S. and
Japan is in the contribution of non-capital inputs. The growth of labor input contributes 38.63 percent of

26

Within computer software, own-account software has a share of 30.4 percent of software cost in the Computers
industry. In 2000 own-account software has a larger share, especially in Machinery (64.5 percent) and Research
(62.9 percent), where industry-specific software is required.

33

the U.S. economic growth during 1977-2000, by comparison with 18.08 percent in Japan. Relative to
Japan, the U.S. economic growth is more labor-intensive. Japanese economic growth depends more
heavily on productivity growth, reflecting the opportunities for “catching up” with the U.S. and other
industrialized economies during the period 1960-2000.
iii. Productivity and IT
The aggregate TFP contribution to the Japanese economy as a whole is shown in Table 2. Until
the beginning of the 1970s, rapid economic growth approaching 10 percent per year was supported by the
TFP growth of 3.05 percent. Of this TFP growth 2.02 percent is contributed by Non-IT manufacturing,
0.86 percent by Non-manufacturing, and only 0.17 percent by IT manufacturing. TFP growth by industry
is shown in Table 19. Even in the period 1960-1973, the TFP growth in the three IT manufacturing
industries was highest; however, the small Domar weights of IT manufacturing industries resulted in a
relatively small contribution.27
During 1973-1990, aggregate TFP contributes only 0.88 percent annually to Japanese economic
growth. The serious decline of the TFP contribution can be found in Non-IT manufacturing and Nonmanufacturing industries. The TFP contribution of the IT manufacturing industries increases to 0.20
percent. The increase of the contribution in IT manufacturing is due to the high TFP growth rate in
Computers of 8.54 percent, shown in Table 19, accompanied by a rapid expansion in the Domar weight.
In the early 1990s aggregate TFP turns negative. The overall contribution is –0.48 percent, –0.30
percent in Non-IT manufacturing and –0.27 percent in Non-manufacturing. Even in IT manufacturing, the
contribution is only 0.09 percent. In this period, the TFP growth in Computers is only 1.03 percent
annually; by contrast the U.S. computer industry has TFP growth of 11.87 percent (Jorgenson, Ho, and
Stiroh, 2005). The weakness in price competition in the closed Japanese market is clearly evident in this
period. Value added growth in Computers declines remarkably from 32.65 percent growth during 19731990 to 3.34 percent in the early 1990s, as represented in Table 8. In this period, Communications
Equipment has a negative value added growth rate.
Relative to other industries, IT manufacturing revived after 1995, so that the annual growth rates
of value added in the three IT manufacturing industries exceeds 20 percent. Figure 5 gives TFP growth
and the industry contribution to aggregate TFP in the late 1990s. The growth rate of TFP is 6.38 percent
for Computers, 7.07 percent for Communications Equipment, and 7.96 percent for Electronic
Components, respectively. The contribution of TFP growth in IT manufacturing to the economic growth
27

Domar weights by industry are represented in Table 6. By definition, the industry-sum of value added weights in
Table 5 is 100 and the industry-sum of Domar weights is over 100; the industry-sum is 242.7 in 1960 and gradually

34

at the economy-wide level is 0.39 percent, which is four times higher than the contribution in the early
1990s.
(Insert Figure 5 and Figure 6)
Figure 6 shows the differences between the TFP growth rates and industry contributions in the
early 1990s and the late 1990s. By comparison, Figure 2 shows the differences in value added by industry.
The industry TFP growth improved more broadly than industry value added growth. Although the TFP
growth rates are small or negative in Non-IT manufacturing industries in the late 1990s, the differences
between the two periods show widespread improvements. At the economy-wide level, the TFP
contribution of Non-IT manufacturing recovers from –0.30 percent to 0.29 percent, as shown in Table 2.
The revival in the Other Electric Machinery industry is especially notable during this period. The TFP
growth is 4.11 percent in the late 1990s, which is higher than the 3.77 percent growth during 1960-1973.
The Domar weight in this industry is greater than the sum of the Domar weights in three IT
manufacturing industries. In Japanese economy TFP growth in Non-IT manufacturing has recovered since
1995.
The recovery of TFP growth in the late 1990s is not apparent in Non-manufacturing industries,.
However, within the service industries, TFP growth revives in the two industries; the Communications
industry has a TFP growth rate of 3.58 percent and Finance and Insurance industry a rate of 2.27 percent.
Both industries are highly IT-capital-intensive, as shown in Figure 4. No obvious increases in TFP growth
in the IT-using industries are found in the U.S. productivity statistics presented by Jorgenson, Ho, and
Stiroh (2005). On the other hand, the widespread TFP gains in the U.S. in the late 1990s are still not
apparent in Japan. Figure 7 represents TFP indexes in twelve selected industries. Two representative
industries within Non-manufacturing with no improvement are the Wholesale and Retail industry and the
Construction industry. Both strongly impact economy-wide growth due to large Domar weights. The TFP
indexes in both industries decrease from the beginning of the 1990s.
(Insert Figure 7)
Table 3 represents the growth rates of the aggregate production function TFP. This includes
aggregation bias in value added, capital input, and labor input. In every sub-period, this measure is greater
than the growth rate of aggregate TFP. In the 1990s, the over-estimate exceeds 1.0 percent per year. Table
decreases to 185.7 in 2000. The increase in the rate of value added leads to a decrease in the industry-sum of Domar

4 shows the growth rate of average labor productivity (ALP) and its decomposition. In the late 1990s,
despite the resurgence of aggregate TFP growth, aggregate ALP growth declines slightly from the early
1990s, due to decreases in capital deepening and labor quality. ALP growth is heavily influenced by
particular labor-intensive industries.
Labor productivity by industry is shown in Table 20. In a number of industries, labor productivity
growth has improved since 1995. However, some labor-intensive industries have decreased their labor
productivity growth. The Construction industry and Wholesale and Retail industry have negative growth
in labor productivity in the late 1990s. Ironically, the increase of unemployment due to the long recession
generated additional labor supplies for both industries. Figure 7 represents the labor productivity indexes
for selected industries, measured in the right axis. In IT-capital-intensive industries – three IT
manufacturing industries, Communications, and Finance and Insurance industry – the growth of labor
productivity is higher than TFP growth in the late 1990s.

VI. Conclusion
In the 1990s the resurgence of the U.S. economy stimulated optimism, while the long recession of
the Japanese economy engendered pessimism. The optimistic view for the U.S. economy has been
supported by the widespread impact of IT. Contrary to the Solow Paradox, the observed facts about IT
impacts can be found everywhere in the productivity statistics since the late 1990s. The enhanced role of
investment in IT is a conspicuous feature of the U.S. economy and a growth revival is under way in many
important IT-using industries. Our major goal in this paper is to characterize the role of IT in the Japanese
economy, especially in the “lost decade” of the 1990s.
Our main conclusion is a growth revival can be spotted in many Japanese industries. This can be
clearly detected in the growth of value added and productivity in IT manufacturing industries and ITusing industries like Communications and Finance and Insurance since 1995. Even during economic
recession periods in Japan, IT capital has been incorporated into the production structure. The ITintensive industries have generated a modest recovery in the growth of TFP and labor productivity in the
Japanese economy.
However, widespread diffusion of IT is absent in the Japanese economy by 2000. Due to the
differences in economic conditions, the Japanese economy has responded to the progress of IT in a
different way from the U.S. economy. The dwindling of demand and the restructuring of the economy
have inhibited the spread of IT in Japan. For many of the Non-IT manufacturing and Non-manufacturing

weights.

36

industries, the shift from Non-IT capital to IT capital has been postponed into the future and widespread
productivity gains are still to come.
Relative to the U.S., the growth of Japanese economy during the period 1960-1973 depended
more heavily on growth in TFP, as Japanese industries approached the levels of technology in their U.S.
counterparts. This process slowed dramatically after 1973 and then reversed course in the early 1990s.
The growth rate of labor quality is decreasing in Japan, as in other countries. Unlike other countries, the
labor force in Japan has already entered a phase of decline. Future growth will depend on a revival of
capital deepening and investment in information technology will continue to have an essential role.
