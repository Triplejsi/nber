Macroeconomic Planning and Disequilibrium:
Estimates for Poland, 1955—1980

ABSTRACT
This paper specifies and estimates a four—equation disequilibrium
model of the consumption goods market in a centrally planned economy
(CPE).

The data are from Poland for the period 1955—1980, but the

analysis is more general and will be applied to other CPEs as soon as
the appropriate data sets are complete.

This work is based on

previous papers of Portes and Winter (P—W) and Charemza and Quandt
(C—Q).

P—W applied to each of four CPEs a discrete—switching

disequilibrium model with a household demand equation for consumption

goods, a planners' supply equation, and a "mm" condition stating that
the observed quantity transacted is the lesser of the quantities
demanded and supplied.

C-Q considered how an equation for the

adjustment of planned quantities could be integrated into a CPE model
with fixed prices and without the usual price adjustment equation.
They made plan formation endogenous and permitted the resulting plan
variables to enter the equations determining demand and supply.
This paper implements the C—Q proposal in the P—W context.

It uses

a unique new data set of time series for plans for the major
macroeconomic variables in Poland and other CPEs.

The overall

framework is applicable to any large organization which plans economic
variables.

Introduction

This paper specifies and estimates a four—equation disequilibrium
model of the consumption goods market in a centrally planned economy
(CPE).

The data are from Poland for the period 1955—1980, but the

analysis is more general and will be applied to other CPE5 as soon as
the appropriate data sets are complete.

The work reported here is based on the previous papers of Portes
and Winter (1980) and Charemza and Quandt (1982), referred to below as
P—W and C—Q.

The former applied to each of four CPE5 a

discrete—switching disequilibrium model with a household demand
equation for consumption goods, a planners' supply equation, and a

"mm" condition stating that the observed quantity transacted is the
lesser of the quantities demanded and supplied.

an equation for the adjustment of planned quantities could be
integrated into a CPE model with fixed prices and without the usual
price adjustment equation.

They made plan formation endogenous and

permitted the resulting plan variables to enter the equations
determining demand and supply.

Depending on the precise

specification of the equation determining the plan, the model could
adjust towards market clearing in a manner similar to that of
disequilibrium models with price adjustment equations.
This paper implements the C—Q proposal in the P—W context.

It

differs from P—W in several respects: (1) the data are extended
beyond 1975, up to 1980; (ii) the main series have been more or less
substantially revised, using new information; (iii) a plan—adjustment
equation determines the published plan for aggregate consumption by
households; (iv) this plan enters the equation for the supply of
consumption goods; (v) the variables constructed by P—W to measure
deviations from plans for exogenous variables (output, investment,
defence expenditure), which proxied the plan series by second—order
quadratic trends, now use published plan data.

The model here

differs from C—Q in having a more general form of plan—adjustment
equation than they propose.

The work reported here was possible only because we were able to
assemble reliable time series for plans for the major macroeconomic
variables in Poland and other CPEs.

Using this new and unique data

set, our empirical work can now go beyond the question posed by P—W,
which concerned the existence of excess demand in the aggregate
consumption goods markets of CPEs, to a range of important questions

concerning the planning process and macroeconomic disequilibrium: Are
the plans in a CPE properly represented as endogenous, determined by

FLDABK

stable economic relationships rather than political caprice?

How

do plans so determined then influence the planners and the economy?
Do the planners plan for macroeconomic equilibrium (i.e., does the
plan refer to their planned supply or to their intention for the
quantity transacted)? Is the disequilibrium macro framework
appropriate and useful for the analysis of CPEs (see Portes, 1981a)?
There are also interesting theoretical and econometric questions which

arise, some of which will provide material for future work. The
overall framework is applicable to any large organisation which plans
economic variables.

The Simple Disequilibrium Model

2.

The basic framework of our general model for Poland is taken from
P—W with the modifications indicated above.

Thus the consumption

demand equation is identical to that in P—W, derived directly from the
Houthakker—Taylor savings function:

CDt = cLiDNFA_i

+ c2DYD + cz3YD + u1

(1)

where
CD = household desired expenditure on consumption goods and
services
DNFA = household saving, measured as the change in net financial
assets of households, NFA, during the period (NFA. is the
end—of—period net stock of financial assets); DNFAt_i was
called Si in P—W

DYD = change in disposable income from the previous to the
current period

YD =

The Plan—Adjustment Equation

We have worked previously (Portes et al., 1983) with a model of
the form (l)—(3), supplemented with a plan—adjustment equation
specified as

C*jti = cSiC_iI_2 +

62't—l + cS3Ct 2

+ S4RNFAt2

+ y(CD — CS) + u4

(4)

where u4 N(O,).
We justified this by reference to the discussion of plannerst
behaviour in Gacs and Lacko (1973) and Kornai (1971).
Single—equation models of plan formation involving only previous plans
and realizations are discussed by Yeo (1983).

Different schemes

yield relationships including the first three terms of equation (4),

with differing interpretations of (&, 2' 53).

We added responses

to observed "excess" household liquidity (RNFA) and to excess demand.
We justified the period t excess demand term in (4) with a "planners'
rational expectations" argument, while recognizing that period (t—1)
excess demand might have been preferable, were it not for the
intractable likelihood function which it generates in the complete

model of equations (1) —

(4).

An alternative approach to the specification of the plan equation
is to construct a model of optimizing behaviour by the planners.

The

full optimizing problem facing the planners of a CPE in drawing up a
macroeconomic plan is extremely complicated.

Performance relative to plan in the current

period gives the planners additional information about future
performance, and they adjust accordingly the perceived costs of
deviations from the long—run growth path.

If X2>O,

the planners

find that a plan for next period above the growth path is less costly.
Similarly, if the plan in period t was underfulfilled (

X2<0

),

then

the planners find a plan below the growth path again more acceptable

than otherwise. On the other hand, when X1 and X2 have opposite signs
this increases the cost of planning above or below the long—run growth

path. The interaction term, X1X2, therefore enters negatively into

the loss function, so a2 < 0.

The effect of this term is similar to

that of making the weights i.i1and u2 a function of plan fulfilment.

The second main argument of the loss function is future excess
demand for consumption goods.

There is a large literature about the

planners' attitude to excess demand and supply of consumption goods

because the repercussions of both excess demand and excess supply

cumulate from period to period. If excess demand persists households
accumulate cash balances, their frustration increases and labour

supply incentives diminish. Similarly, successive periods of excess

similar to equation (4) above. The chief difference is the absence

in (4). Following our previous work (see beginning of this Section),
this term has in fact been included in the estimated plan equation.

The persistent insignificance of its coefficient (see below) supports
the approach taken here.

The plan equation (9) contains terms in excess demand. To
make this operational, it must be embedded in a model of the form of
equations (l)—(3), where current excess demand

First, although it is

theoretically possible to derive the likelihood function of this type
of model with lagged dependent variables (Quandt, 1981), it is still

computationally intractable unless u4 is identically zero.

Thus

only one of the excess demand terms in equation (9) can be included
in the estimated equation.

The other will have to be proxied by an

alternative measure of excess demand.

The second problem concerns

Note also that long—run stability requires I(St<l (Portes et al.,
1983).

There are several different ways of Interpreting the excess

demand terms in equation (10) so as to make It operational.
Model 1:
One relatively simple way of incorporating disequilibrium into
the plan formation equation is to take account of liquid asset

holdings of the population. In this model, to maintain comparability
with our previous work, we consider the formation of the plan for year

t at the end of year t—l. We therefore take a lagged version of
equation (10), which is similar to equation (4). The variable

RNFA2 measures

the deviation from trend of net financial assets

at the end of period t—2 or the beginning of period t—1. The planners

FLDABK

13

know this variable when they formulate the year t plan at the end of

t—l. Our plan formation equation would therefore be

that since no current endogenous variables appear on the 1UIS of (11),

simultaneous estimation of the plan equation is unnecessary and will
yield the same results as estimation by OLS.

Model II:

We prefer to introduce disequilibrium explicitly into our model
in a manner consistent with the optimizing model developed above.
Taking again the formation of the plan for year t at the end of year
t—l we would have

(12)

As remarked above, it is computationally infeasible to include both
current and lagged excess demand terms, and we therefore seek proxies
for the lagged excess demand term.

One possible measure of excess

demand in year t—l is the behavior of financial assets held by the
population, and we take the deviation from trend of net financial

assets at the end of year t—2 or beginning of year t—1, RNFAt2•

Both models introduce restrictions

across the parameters of the equations of the full model.

The strong informational requirements of Model I may be relaxed
in another way as well — by shifting the timing of the plan formation
equation one period forward relative to models I —

That is, we

return to the original timing of the plan equation as the plan for

In this model, the planners respond to current disequilibrium

(CD_CS) at the time they are making the plan for t+l. They also
respond to the deviation from trend of assets at the beginning of
period t, since this would be known at the beginning of year t.
This formulation of the model is to some extent more natural in that
it mimics the recursive nature of the planning process in which the

announced plan

is determined before CDt and CS. It should

be noted, however that the equation for

The Plan Data

We believe this to be the first study of the macroeconomic
behaviour of a CPE which includes consistent and comparable
time—series data on plans drawn from original sources.

The data

themselves throw light on the abilities of the planners, events in
Poland, and planning as a process of prediction.
We have used plan data from the mid—1950s to 1980 on four time
series for this paper: consumption, NMP, gross investment and defence.
All variables are defined in constant zloties.

The data on both

plans and realizations (actuals), together with detailed discussion of
methods and sources, are given in Portes et al. (1983).

Table 1

shows the absolute deviations (in percent) of planned growth rates
from actual growth rates.

Viewed in this way, the planners'

performance varies markedly over the period.

The worst year in

terms of accuracy is 1972, when investment, which was planned to grow
at 9.6%, in fact grew at 23.017g.

Thereafter actual investment was

The 1978 plan reduced investment by 5.3%.

Actual

investment rose slightly that year but fell in both 1979 and 1980.
The 1972 plan substantially underpredicted consumption as well.
Then, starting with the plan for 1976, the consumption plans were
underfulfilled for five successive years, with a remarkably large
shortfall in 1978.

The NMP plans, too, were all underfulfilled from

1975 onwards, with a progressive deterioration in the performance
both of the planners and of the economy itself.

Of the 19 observations 1957—75, 9 consumption plans were

underfulfilled and 10 exceeded; for NMP, 7 and 12 fell in these
respective categories.

Thus there was no clear pattern of excessive

pressure on the economy by the planners (or overoptimism), nor of

consumption and NMP plans were consistently underfulfilled, reflecting
the continuous deterioration of performance (as Mr. Gierek's economic
strategy disintegrated) and the planners' inability to come to grips
with it (Portes, 198lb).

Investment and defence expenditure plans

show quite different pictures.

The former were consistently

overfulfilled during the period (19 out of 24).

The latter were

underfulfilled in all but two of the years 1957—67, overfulfilled in
all but one thereafter (through 1980)!

In relation to the mean planned growth rates, the average
absolute deviations given in Table 1 show a fair degree of planning

inaccuracy, if the plans are treated as predictions. Perhaps a better
measure of the predictive power of the planners Is in terms of levels.
Table 2 gives some comparisons.

If the standard errors of the

deviations of planned levels from actuals are compared with the

18

FLDABK

standard deviations of the residuals from second—order autoregressive
processes fitted by OLS to the whole sample, we find the planners
out—perform the time—series regression for investment and defence but

not for consumption and NMP. Our consumption function [equation (1)]
estimated by OLS over the whole sample has a standard error of the
residuals under half that of the AR2 process and a third of the
"standard error of the plan'.

Results
The likelihood functions for the models specified in Section 3

are derived in Appendix B. We used the Davidon—Fletcher—Powell
algorithm to obtain maximum likelihood estimates, with numerical first
derivatives.

We tried variants of each of the models discussed.

Model IV

performed poorly, so we do not report estimates from it.
Model lib (unequal ys) gives no significant improvement in the
likelihood over Ila (which is nested in it), whereas Va is rejected
against Vb.

Thus we report results from Models I, ha, III and Vb.

All the results we give are from estimation with the restriction

= 1.

Our theory regards C* as the ex ante supply plan, with

equation (2) representing the planners' adjustment of actual supply
away from that plan in response to new data.

The planners may

consciously intend excess demand or excess supply.

The restriction

assumes only that when they announce the plan, that is what they do
intend to offer to get their intended outcome.

The restriction

= 1 is accepted by the data for the three models cited and for most
other runs.

The estimates are given in Table 3.

We see immediately that a

FLDABK

19

likelihood ratio test rejects Model I against ha, in which it is
nested.

On the whole, the correspondence with prior beliefs about

the coefficients is good. The demand equations for Model I

and III satisfied all conditions; those for Models ha and Vb give c
the right sign, but somewhat too small in absolute value (though not
significantly so), and both also make ct slightly but significantly

less than its theoretical value of unity. The long—run savings ratio
implied by the estimates for Model I is 2.1% in an economy growing at
5%.

The supply equation is less satisfactory; although the
equation's standard error is reasonable, the plan must be doing most
of the work in explaining supply (which is of course not inconsistent
with the deviations of actual from plan shown In Table 1).

The NMP

deviation term is significant only for Models I and III, with the
correct sign.

But both

and

appear to take the wrong sign consistently. We

discuss this below.

The plan equation performs well.

The second—order lag on

actual consumption, which we included because of previous work by
others and ourselves but does not appear in the theory of Section 3,
also does not appear in the data:

is insignificant throughout.

The signs of other coefficients are as predicted, and the results seem

fairly stable; this equation is probably "best" in Model Vb. Note
that in Model I, the plan equation is decoupled" from the rest of the
model, and results obtained for it by OLS are identical within the
limits of numerical approximation to those shown in Table 3, which

confirms that our optimization programme is working properly. As in

FLDABK

20

our previous paper, we can calculate what constant growth rate of C
would be consistent with exact realization of plans in the estimated

version of equation (4). The answer ranges from 5.7% p.a. in Model
Vb to 7.4% in Model I, quite close to the observed 6.3% p.a. growth
of actual consumption in 1957—80.

As noted in Section 3, we can identify the parameters of our loss
function from the estimated plan—adjustment equation.

0.5, a4 in the range 1.4—1.9, and —1.8 < a2< —0.7 for 0.25

0.75.

The smallest absolute values for a2 come in Model Va when p is large,

giving higher weight to C than to C1

in defining the path on

which the planners are trying to keep the economy. The growth rate on
that path is implied to lie between 5.7% and 7.2%. The signs of all
these parameters accord with our hypothesis, and the magnitudes seem
reasonable.

In addition to examining the point estimates, it is useful to
evaluate the model's ability to forecast actual consumption, C.
Ideally forecasts both from within and outside the sample are of
interest.

In an ordinary linear regression model, it is natural to

compare the point estimate of a forecast with its confidence interval.
Some procedures, such as that of Chow, take into account the sampling
errors of the estimated coefficients.

Others, such as that of

Davidson et al. (1978), confine themselves to the ratio of forecast
variance to residual variance.

In the present models, since the predicted value of C is the

output of a mm. function, it is not straightforward to calculate its

FLDABK

21

confidence interval.

It appears that the simplest method of

evaluating the standard error of the predicted value of C is by
stochastic simulations (for details see Appendix A).

Table 4 shows the predictive performance of the disequilibrium
models.

We use Model Vb, estimated through 1978, to give an ex post

forecast for 1979, and Models I, ha, and III, estimated through 1979,
to give an ex post forecast for 1980. In each case, the prediction is

the minimum of the supply and the demand forecasts. For 1979, the
disequilibrium model is less than one standard deviation from the
actual (see the notes to the Table for interpretation of these

standard deviations). Indeed, it is closer (from below) to the actual
than was the plan, the forecast from an AR2 process on C, or that from
an OLS estimate of equation (1), all of which substantially

overpredicted. For 1980, Model I significantly underpredicted, but
Model ha came within two standard deviations and Model III within
one.

This was a creditable showing in view of the extraordinary

circumstances, in which the output plan proved wildly overoptimistic
(though both the AR2 process and equation (1) do as well as

disequilibrium Model III and somewhat better than I and ha.)
There are various criteria by which we can assign each

observation to an excess demand or excess supply regime. In past
work, we have used the estimated marginal or conditional (on the

observed C) probability

that CDt > CS (Burkett, 1981 showed that

the marginal and conditional probabilities were very close for Poland
in the original P—W study).

Here we report in Table 5 the average

simulated excess demands generated by each model for each year.
The simulation procedure is described in Appendix A.

The

FLDABK

22

average excess demand for a given year is in practice positive if and
only if more than 50 of the 100 simulations for that year show excess
demand, but the correlation with the estimated conditional

probabilities is not perfect.t A more discriminating standard is set
by classifying an observation as excess demand or supply only if the
absolute value of the difference between the average simulated demand
and average simulated supply exceeds twice the standard deviation of
the simulated transacted quantity; in practice, this occurred only
when the proportion of cases in the favoured regime exceeded 75%.

A fairly consistent pattern averaged from applying all these
criteria with the three selected models.

1959, 1961, 1968, 1971—72,

1975, and 1979 were selected as years of clear excess demand. On the
other hand, 1958, 1960, 1962—64, 1967, and 1976—78 appeared to be

periods of excess supply In the consumption goods market. An overall
(though not unambiguous) judgment suggests 1965—66 were also excess

supply years, while 1974 and 1980 were probably excess demand. This
leaves 1957, 1969—70, and 1973 as impossible to classify. The models
themselves do not often disagree, though Vb differs distinctly from
the other three for 1957 and 1965—66, while Models I and III differ
from the other two for 1973—74.

This pattern Is broadly consistent with the development of the
Polish economy since the mid—1950s, and It is undoubtedly more
plausible than the classification (using estimated probabilities) in
Portes and Winter (1980).

The dominance of excess supply in the

earlier years and excess demand in the 1970s accords with the
dominance of tight money wage control until Gierek replaced Gomulka at

t The estimated conditional rr suggest excess demand in 1963 and 1965

all of which show negative average simulated excess demand.

FLDABK

23

tremendous investment boom, 1968 political disquiet.

The excess

supply shown in 1976—78 may reflect the plannerst efforts to satisfy
consumer pressures after the political explosion of mid—1976, while
tightening up their control of money wages and letting inflation
accelerate to soak up purchasing power.
The large estimated excess supply in 1978 appears to be the
consequence of a wildly overoptimistic plan,

which our models do not

scale down sufficiently in response to the considerable shortfall of
NHP from its plan in 1978.

This points out the relative weakness of

the supply equation, which may in part be due to the absence here of

any treatment of foreign trade and borrowing. For example, the
consistently "wrong" sign on 86 was explained in our earlier paper by
a supposed structural change around 1972, when the foreign borrowing
constraint was relaxed.

Then investment need no longer have crowded

out consumption, and indeed the planners might have allowed for some
multiplier effects of investment on consumer demand and accommodated
them with additional imports.

The surprising but small negative coefficient on RNFAt

in the

supply equation must be viewed in the light of the rather large

positive coefficient on the RNFA term in the plan—adjustment equation.
A sustained departure of NFA from trend will give a total effect on

supply, acting through C as well as directly, of

0.05, our estimates

give a range between 0.72 (in Model Vb) and 1.06 (in Model ha).

24

FLDABK

These suggest the planners do indeed seek market clearing: in
response to a sustained increase in household NFA, they would increase
the supply of consumption goods by roughly the same amount.
Judging only by the equation variance, the supply equation
appears to perform better than the demand equation in Models I and

III, whereas we have the converse in Models ha and Vb. This would
suggest that Models I and III would tend to put a higher proportion of
observations on or near the supply curve —

i.e.,

more excess demand in

those models (see P—W, p. 151). Yet in fact the opposite is true,
which may suggest that the classification of observations between
regimes is not merely the consequence of the relative strength of the
specification of the demand and supply equations.

6.

Conclusions

We believe we have taken substantial steps towards answering the
questions posed in Section 1 and demonstrating the applicability of
the C—Q model.

Estimation has shown that it is both feasible and

informative to use plan data, and to model the regularities in the
process of plan construction.

The plan depends upon planned and

actual consumption and excess demand.

These announced plans are

embodied in a supply function which reflects, in addition, unforeseen
subsequent developments in the economy.

The planners do appear to

try to adjust announced plans and actual supply in order to reduce
excess demand.

The disequilibrium macroeconomic framework, with

fixed prices and planned quantities, can be estimated for centrally
planned economies and seems to provide insight into their behaviour.
The pattern of excess demands revealed by the data appears broadly
consistent with economic events in Poland.

25

FLDABK

We

have data sets which permit application of the model to at

least two other countries, and there are various extensions of the

analysis which we shall explore in future work. Moreover, we intend
to apply a similar approach to other macro variables and markets —

e.g.,

investment, the labour market or NMP itself.

Appendix A: Description of the Stochastic Simulations

We performed stochastic simulations for several of the models.
The basic steps in these simulations are as follows:

1) Define the vector 4 =

as (CD,CSt,C) for

models I to IV and as (CD,CS,C+i) for model V. We then can
write the structural equations (excluding the nun

Ay w ÷ u
where w =

condition)

as

(A.1)

(wit,w2,w4)

represents the exogenous and predetermined

variables and their coefficients from the right hand sides of these

equations, u =

(ui,u2,u4)

the corresponding error terms and where

A is a square matrix of coefficients.
2) For each observation, t =

1,

..., T and for each simulation i

substitute in A the values of the estimated coefficients and

substitute in w the estimated coefficients of the predetermined and
exogenous variables and the values of these variables for the tth

observation. Note that A and w do not vary across the simulations i.
3) For each observation t =
i =

1,

...

1,

...,

T, and for each simulation

100 generate three independent normal variables with mean

zero and variances a, o, a, where the latter are the estimated
error variances; denote these simulated normal errors by u for
simulation 1.

4) Obtain simulated solutions

by solving
(A.2)

Al(w + ui)

5) Obtain simulated values of the actual level of consumption
and the simulated forecast error for simulation I from

6) Repeat steps 2 through 5 for simulations I = 1, ... 100
7) For each t =

and f across the simulations I.

It is possible to introduce three sources of random variation in
a stochastic simulation: variations in the estimated coefficients, in
the exogenous variables and in the equation error terms. We have only

introduced variation in the error terms u1 in the work reported here,
but we hope to investigate full stochastic simulations in later work.

Models I and II:

It is convenient to derive the likelihood function for Model lIb first,
since the results for models I and [Ia then follow as special cases.

Model [lb can be written

We assume that ui, u2 and u4 are serially independent normal variates
with a diagonal covariance matrix. The pdf of CDt, CS, C is immediate from
(B.1) to (B.4):

Models Involving Expected Excess Demand (III and IV):
The likelihood functions for the models involving expected excess demand
in the plan adjustment equation can be obtained as follows:

36

The structural equations include (B.l), (B.2), (B.3), but the plan
equation is now

Ck1

=

z3

(B.1O)

+ yEt_i(CDt—CSt) + u4

where z1, z2, z3, z and z5 are as defined for Model II. For simplicity we
again denote C1_1 by C and Et_i(CD_CS) by Er_i in what follows. Because
Et_i itself depends only on predetermined and exogenous variables, the density
function of the observable random variables is the product of the pdf for a
simple disequilibrium model corresponding to (B.1), (B.2) and (B.3), and the
pdf of the single equation model given by (B.1O):

should be noted that the model does not decouple into two independent

sub—models because in general, Et_i will depend on the parameters in the other
equations, thus introducing cross—equation restrictions.

The likelihood function in (B.11) cannot be used directly, since we have
not specified how the term Er_i is to be evaluated. Substituting from (B.1)

and (B.2) into the expression for Et_l yields

where the expectations E are all taken at time t—1.
We assume that E(ui) = 0 in model III and model IV. This is consistent
with our assumption that the disturbances are serially uncorrelated, which

37

implies that the conditional mean at t—l will equal the unconditional mean.

Model III:

One very simple assumption is that the z variables in the expression for
are all known with certainty at time t—1 and are thus effectively

non—random. If we replace each expectation Involving zs with the corresponding

realized value, and if we take E(z4tu4) =

E

This

z4E(u4)

= 0 we have from (B.12)

t

zlt_ z2t (12z4 )z3
1 + y(i+2z4)

(B.13)

assumes that the planners know the realizations of these variables

when they draw up the plan In period t—1. Since some of these are period t
realizations, this Is a fairly strong assumption.
Model IV:
An alternative method is to evaluate this expectation based on an

information set more likely to be available to planners at t—1. We proceed as
follows:

We assume E(uit) = 0 as before. We also assume that the expectations of

the deviations from plan are zero, giving E(z4) = 0 and E(z2) = 4R11FAt_i
which we take to be zero.
We then have to evaluate the following:

(a) E(zi). This variable consists of current and lagged income and lagged
savings. The logic of our model suggests that we should use the realizations of
lagged income and savings and the plan for income for period t. We have not yet
been able to construct a suitable series of income plans and we therefore make
the assumption that the planners know at time t—l what Income at time t will

be. We therefore assume E(z )
it

=z
lt

(b) E(z3): We set this equal to z3 since it is known (or nearly known) at
time t—l.

(c) E(z4z3): This is the correlation between the (proportional) deviation of

38

NMP from plan and the non—endogenous variables in the plan equation. Since
is known when the NMP plan is formed, an assumption in the spirit of the
expectations literature would be that deviations from such plans represent
"surprises" which are orthogonal to the information set on which the plan is

based. Thus we assume z3 to be orthogonal to z4
(d) E(z4u4): This is the correlation between the deviation of NMP from plan
and the residual in the consumption plan equation. We will assume this to be

zero. If Is not z4 is essentially an endogenous variable. We recognize that
while there may be no feedback from actual consumption to actual NMP within one
period, consumption plans and NMP plans (like all plans of macro variables)

will be mutually dependent. We could, however, assume a two—stage process
in which the planners plan NMP, investment and defence and then plan
consumption.

These assumptions give us

Since the determinants of the matrices on the left—hand sides of (B.20) and
(B.21) have the same sign, we can establish that the model is coherent.

From (B.20) and (B..21) we can immediately obtain the pdf's of CDt,CSt and C1.
Completing the square, integrating out CS for (a) and CDt for (b) and adding

we obtain the pdf of C, C1 as
