Optimal Bond Trading With Personal Taxes:
Implications For Bond Prices and
Estimated Tax Brackets and Yeild Curves

ABSTRACT

The assumption that bondholders follow either a buy-and—hold or a
continuous

realization trading policy, rather than the optimal trading policy,

is at variance with reality and, as we demonstrate, may seriously bias the
estimation of the yield curve and the implied tax bracket of the marginal
investor. Tax considerations which govern a bondholder's optimal trading
policy

include the following: realization of capital losses, short term if

possible; deferment of the realization of capital gains, especially if they
are short term; changing the holding period status from long term to short
term by sale of the bond and repurchase, so that future capital losses may be
realized short term; and raising the basis through sale of the bond and
repurchase in order to deduct from ordinary income the amortized premium.
Because of the interaction of these factors, no simple characterization of the

optimal trading policy is possible. We can say, however, that it differs
substantially from the buy-and-hold policy irrespective of whether the

bondholder is a bank, a bond dealer, or an individual. We obtain these strong
results even when we allow for transactions costs and explicitly consider
numerous IRS regulations designed to curtail tax avoidance.

1. Introduction

The yield curve implied by the prices of Treasury notes and bonds and
corporate bonds is of interest to economists and practitioners alike: it
reflects the investors' beliefs about the future course of the short term

interest rate. In calculating the yield curve, the tax bracket of the
marginal bondholder is either taken to be some given number or is estimated

simultaneously with the yield curve. The implied tax bracket of the marginal
investor is of independent interest. It provides a direct (but incomplete)
test of Miller's (1977) theory on the optimal capital structure of firms. It
may also be useful for determining fair prices for other assets.

There are two major problems in estimating pure discount rates (the yield

curve of zero coupon bonds) and the implied marginal tax rate. The first
problem is that of differing clienteles, studied in detail by Schaefer (1981,

1982a). For a given investor some bonds of particular maturities and coupon
rates may

be

dominated by combinations of other bonds. In this case tax

clienteles naturally arise.

If there is no one clientele for which every bond

remains undominated, then the concept of the "marginal taxable investor" who
"sets" all prices may well be meaningless.

The second problem is that of the assumed investment horizon. This is
the focus of the present paper. By necessity we ignore the problems of tax
clienteles. Extant estimation procedures assume either that the bond is held
to maturity, without intermediate realization of capital gains and losses (the
buy—and—hold policy), or that capital gains and losses are realized every

period as they occur (the continuous realization policy). Both the buy-andhold policy and the continuous realization policy lead to relatively simple

bond pricing formulae. This facilitates the estimation of the yield curve and
the implied tax bracket of the marginal investor.

2

The assumption that bondholders follow either a buy—and-hold or a
continuous realization trading policy, rather than the optimal trading policy,
is at variance with reality and, as we demonstrate, may seriously bias the
estimation of the yield curve and the implied tax bracket of the marginal

investor. Perusal of the Wall Street Journal provides convincing evidence
that investment advisors——and presumably their clients are aware of the
optimal trading policies which frequently differ sharply from a buy-and—hold

or continuous realization policy. By definition, the marginal bondholder is
an economic agent (or group of agents) of sufficient stature to set bond

prices at the margin. It is illogical then to assert that the marginal
investor follows a suboptimal trading policy through ignorance.

The present paper unifies two recent strands of research, the pricing of
bonds with stochastically varying interest rates and investment opportunity

set and the pricing of stocks in the presence of personal taxes. Cox,
Ingersoll and Ross (1981, 1983) presented an equilibrium theory of bond
pricing and the term structure of interest rates, in particular explaining the
valuation of. a deterministic stream of cash flows but with a stochastically

varying interest rate and investment opportunity set. Constantinides (1982,
1983) and Constantinides and Scholes (1980) discussed the optimal trading of
stocks and options in the presence of personal taxes and presented an
equilibrium theory of stock pricing, in particular explaining the effect of
optimal realization of capital gains and losses on the pricing of stocks.

Tax considerations which govern a bondholder's optimal trading policy

include the following: realization of capital losses, short term if possible;
deferment of the realization of capital gains, especially if they are short
term; changing the holding period status from long term to short term by sale
of the bond and repurchase, so that future capital losses may be realized

3

short term; and raising the basis through sale of the bond and repurchase in

order to deduct from ordinary income the amortized premium. Because of the
interaction of these factors, no simple characterization of the optimal

trading policy is possible. We can say, however, that it differs
substantially from the buy-and-hold policy irrespective of whether the

bondholder is a bank, a bond dealer, or an individual. We obtain these strong
results even when we allow for transactions costs and explicitly consider
numerous IRS regulations designed to curtail tax avoidance.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we outline the tax
provisions in four representative tax scenarios which may apply to the elusive

marginal bondholder. The formal model is presented in Section 3. Closed—form
solutions for the prices of consol bonds and the value of the timing option

are presented in Section 4 for a special case. In Section 5 we derive the
optimal trading policies under more general conditions and in Section 6 we
illustrate the effect of taxes on the prices of bonds and on the value of the

timing option. The estimation of the yield curve and the tax bracket of the
marginal investor is grossly biased if the value of the timing option is

ignored. This point is illustrated in Section 7. In Section 8 we discuss
municipal bonds. Concluding remarks are offered in Section 9.

2. The Tax Environment

To avoid

a profusion of details in our discussion we abstract from many

of the nuances of the regulations governing the taxation of income, as defined
by the tax code and its interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service and the

courts. We do emphasize, however, certain important aspects of the code,
which, though largely ignored in finance, may materially affect bond prices

and the estimation of the yield curve and the marginal tax rate. We also
provide some historical perspective to familiarize the reader with major

4

changes in the tax code which may be reflected in a time series of bond
yields.

At least four broad classes of potential marginal investors warrant

examination: individuals, banks and bond dealers, corporations, and tax—
exempt institutions. Consider first the tax rules applicable to individual
investors.

Coupon income (net of interest expense) is taxed at the individual's
marginal tax rate on ordinary income, the maximum rate being currently 50%.
Between 1970 and 1980, coupon income was classified as "unearned income" and

was taxed at a maximum rate of 72%. Prior to the seventies, the top marginal
tax rate varied from a low of 7% in 1913 to a high of 95% in 1945. In our
calculations we assume that the marginal tax rate on coupon income for an

individual is t =

if

c

The taxation of capital gains is complex. Unrealized gains and losses
remain untaxed. Gains and losses are taxed in the year that they are
realized. A realized gain or loss is the difference between the sales price
(less cost of sale) and the basis. For most assets the basis is just the
purchase price (plus cost of purchase), but for some bonds the purchase price
is subject to adjustment.

We consider only original issue par bonds, defined as such by the IRS if
the original issue discount does not exceed 1/4 of 1 percent multiplied by the

number of full years to maturity. For these bonds, if the purchase price •in
the secondary market is below par, no adjustment is made and the basis is just

the purchase price. If the purchase price is above par, this difference is

1/

Miller (1977) shows that, under simple tax rules, the marginal
bondholder is in the corporate tax bracket, and provides partial justification
for our choice of the tax rate. In any case, our qualitative results are
insensitive to the assumed rate.

5

is allowed as a deduction against ordinary income and the bond's basis is

correspondingly reduced. There is no specific limitation on this deduction.
In our calculations the amortized amount is (negatively) taxed at the rate

T = .5.
C

Realized capital gains and losses are either short term or long term.
The required holding period for long term treatment is currently one year.

This has varied many times since capital gains were first differentiated from

ordinary income in 1922. In the years 1942—1977 the holding period was six
months. Prior to that time there were three or more categories of long term
capital gains with required holding periods as long as ten years.

Net short term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income. Net long term
capital gains are currently taxed at 40% of the investor's marginal tax rate

on ordinary income. This treatment has also been changed. The tax rate on
long term gains has varied from 20% to 80% of the tax rate on ordinary

income. In addition there have been periods in which alternate treatment
could be elected (or, was required for large capital gains).

Net short term capital losses and 50% of net long term capital losses are
deducted from ordinary income and may jointly reduce the taxable ordinary

income by a maximum of $3,000 (until 1976, $1,000). Unused losses are carried
forward indefinitely. Short term losses and long term gains, incurred in the
same year, offset each other dollar for dollar, instead of being taxed at
their respective rates.

—2/amortization

is optional for Treasury and corporate bonds. Since for
practically all individuals the marginal tax rate on ordinary income is no
less than the capital gains tax rate, amortization of the basis dominates
foregoing this option. The amortization method need not be straight line, but
may be that customarily used by the individual, if it is deemed to be
reasonable. If the bond is callable, the basis is amortized to the call price
at the call date or to par at maturity, whichever yields the smaller
amortization. If there are alternate call dates the rule is complex.

6

We define r

to be the marginal tax rate on short term capital gains

arid losses. This rate is not necessarily equal to the marginal tax rate on

ordinary income: if the investor has net short term losses and the deduction

limit is binding, r = 0;

if the investor has net short term losses but

larger long term gains, t

is 40% of the marginal tax rate on ordinary

income. Likewise, we define

TL to be the marginal tax rate on long term

capital gains and losses.

If an asset is sold at a loss within thirty days before or after the
acquisition of "substantially identical" property, the IRS can disallow the

loss deduction under the "wash sale" rule. An investor has a high probability
of circumventing this rule by purchasing instead another bond with a slightly

different coupon or maturity. In any case, this rule is not applicable to
dealers or individual taxpayers who are in the business of trading bonds.
Consequently we ignore the wash sale rule throughout this paper.

We consider three representative tax scenarios for an individual
bondholder and one scenario for banks or bond dealers, as defined by the

marginal rates t, t, and
I. The marginal investor is an individual. Coupon income is taxed at

the rate T = .5.
C

Realized short term and long term gains and

losses are taxed at the rate t =
s
L

= .25.

The deduction limit is

not binding.

This scenario is plausible if the individual is periodically forced to
sell some of his portfolio assets by factors beyond his control (or, of more
importance than the tax consequences) and, on average, realizes large long

term gains. Then the deduction limit is not binding. Since short term losses
must be used to offset the long term gains, the marginal tax rate is the long

7

3/

term gains rate.

We take the long term gains rate to be half of the

investor's marginal tax rate on ordinary income, as it was between 1942 and

1979. We also assume that the investor can always defer the realization of
short term gains until the holding period exceeds one year and then realize
the gains long term.

II. The marginal investor Is an individual. Coupon incom is taxed at

the rate t = .5.

Realized short term gains and losses are taxed

at the rate

= .5.

at the rate

=

.25.

Realized long term gains and losses are taxed
The deduction limit is not binding.

Scenario II is the least plausible one because it ignores both the

deduction limit and the (unfavorable for the taxpayer) offsetting of long term

4/
gains with short term losses.

Since investors have a tax incentive to

realize losses and defer gains (at least, short term gains), the assumption
that the deduction limit is not binding may be tenuous and is relaxed in the
next scenario.

—3/Similarly

the right to deduct half of long term losses from income,
even under the current 40% rule for long term capital gains, could not be
used. Losses could only be deducted from other capital gains. Thus, the
effective tax rate on both long term gains and losses is the same.

—4/The

individual may mitigate this offset provision of the tax law by
realizing long term gains and short and long term losses in alternate tax
years; however, we do not explicitly model this. See Constantirtides (1982).
This procedure may also help to avoid the unfavorable long term gain and loss
offset.

the rate t

—

Short and long term gains and losses remain

untaxed, i.e., t =

L

= 0.

One justification for this scenario is to assume that the individual

realizes losses and defers gains. At the margin losses can only be carried
forward

as the deduction limit is

binding. The only tax "game" permitted

under this scenario is to realize a gain on a bond in order
above

to raise its basis

par and start deducting the premium amortization against ordinary

income. As we shall see, this policy is profitable.
Although

regulations

related

corporations are taxed differently from individuals, the tax

on nonbank

corporations that hold bonds for reasons not directly

to their business purposes are sufficiently similar to those applying

to individuals that the previous scenarios remain at least qualitatively

correct. The primary distinction is that a net capital loss (short and long
combined) cannot be deducted in any amount from ordinary income, but may

be

carried back for three years and forward for five years as a short term loss

to offset gains. Banks and (corporate or individual) bond dealers are taxed
differently, however.

For banks and dealers, bond coupons and all realized capital gains and
losses are treated as ordinary income or loss without explicit limitation.

Net operating losses of banks are carried back for ten years and forward for

five years. In the following scenario we effectively assume that the bank has
positive net earnings in every ten year period so that loss benefits are

earned immediately. Corporate earnings and losses are taxed at the corporate
rate of 50%. (The current corporate tax rate is 46% on earnings in excess of

$100,000. In the past it has been as high as 54%.) The same scenario applies

to

a bond dealer with marginal personal or corporate tax rate on ordinary

income equal to 50%.

IV. The marginal holder is a bank or bond dealer. Coupon income and all
capital gains and losses are taxed at the rate 'r =

ts =

L

= .5.

There is no deduction limit.

In each of the scenarios, I-IV, the tax rates r c,

t

S

and

t

L

are

assumed to remain constant over time because we wish to focus on the long run

effect of taxes on bond prices. Certain trading policies not examined here
would become optimal at the timethat tax provisions were about to change.
For example, when the effective maximum rate on long term capital gains was
changed from 28% to 20% by the 1978 Tax Revenue Act, individuals paying the
28% rate should have deferred realizing their capital gains, ceteris

paribus. Similarly if an investor's income were to change sufficiently to
place him in a different tax bracket, the optimaltrading policy might be
affected.

We also examine bond prices in each of the four tax scenarios under

the

assumption that the bondholder is (artificially) constrained to follow a buy—
and—hold policy and compare the bond prices, tax timing option, and yields to

the case when the investor follows optimal policies. The buy—and-hold economy
is taken as our primary benchmark in which there are no price effects induced
by tax trading.

We do not explicitly examine a scenario in which the marginal bondholder

is exempt from all taxes. This might be considered a serious omission because
tax-exempt intermediaries currently hold more than one-third of all the
outstanding government and corporate bonds and account for an even greater

proportion of the trading volume. Furthermore, liberalized tax-deferred
retirement plans provide growing opportunities for taxable individuals to

defer the tax on coupons, dividends and capital gains until retirement. If
the marginal investor is tax—exempt, then there are obviously no tax—induced

10

in bond prices. 5/

However, since the no—trading policy dominates any

other for a tax—exempt investor (in a perfect market), we may assume the buy—

and-hold

and

policy. Consequently bond prices should equal the benchmark values,

standard estimation techniques, such as McCulloch's (1975), should verify

that the marginal tax bracket is zero.

r(Y, t). The single period bond is perfectlj divisible and may be bought or

in this case, however, when taxes do not affect bond prices, taxed

respectively) is indifferent between buying the coupon bond or investing in

the single—period bond. That there exists some tax bracket (t c, T s ,

L

with the property that an investor in this tax bracket is indifferent between

the two investments over a time interval dt,

is a weak assumption. The

strong part of our assumption is that investors in the same tax brackt are

the margin throughout the bond's term tomaturity.

In a richer model (beyond

our present scope) one might allow for the possibility that the bond is passed
from one tax clientele to another as it approaches maturity or as it becomes a

premium or discount bond due to shifts in interest rates. Since we wish to
focus on the already complex problem of the optimal realization of capital
gains and losses, we abstract from issues related to changing tax

7/
clienteles.

We make the (perhaps unnecessarily strong)

assumption that all

marginal investors are in the same tax bracket.

We present first a discussion of the issues relating to the determination
of the equilibrium bond prices and the value to a marginal, investor of holding
a particular bond with an established

cost basis. In the next section we use

a specific model to discuss the valuation problem

from the point of view of

investors not at the margin.

7/

Tax clienteles for bonds is an important issue which has been
extensively discussed by Schaefer (1981, 1982a, 1982b) under the assumption
below, under tax laws
that bonds are held to maturity. As we demonstrate
similar to those in the U.S., a buy-and-hold policy is inferior to trading
schemes which involve (among other things) early realization of capital
losses. Under British regulations1 which imposed no long term capital gains
tax on "gilt" securities prior to 1962 or after 1969, such trading schemes
have no direct benefits, so a buy—and-hold policy is not necessarily
inferior. Neither need it be correct, however. Even in Schaefer's world,
future changes in interest rates or the introduction of new bonds may cause an
existing bond to become dominated for its current clientele. The anticipation
of such events should be reflected in the bond's price, and this may mask some
selling at a discount that
clientele effects. For example, any bond currently
which time
appears to have a high tax clientele was originally a par bond at
it probably appeared to have a lower tax clientele.

.12

The price of a coupon bond, P, is defined to be such that an investor

in the given tax bracket (t ,
c

S

, t L) is

indifferent between purchasing the

coupon bond now or investing p dollars in the single period bond over the
time interval dt. This equilibrium condition is formalized below as the
after-tax version of the local expectations hypothesis. After purchasing the
coupon bond, the investor follows the derived optimal trading policy as
opposed to a continuous realization or a buy—and—hold policy.
If an investor's cost basis differs from the prevailing bond price, he
may be unwilling (or more than willing) to sell it at that price and thereby

realize a capital gain or loss. His reluctance (or eagerness) to sell has

nothing to do with the bond price being "unfair." If his cost basis were
equal to the price, the same investor would be indifferent to selling at that
price because, by definition, the bond price is such that he is indifferent
between purchasing the bond (and establishing a basis equal to the price) or

investing in the short-term dicount bond.
There may be instances when all investors have cost bases such that

nobody is willing to sell the bond at the "prevailing price." To avoid this
purely technical difficulty, we assume that the government supplies any
existing bond at the above—defined price with infinite elasticity. This
assumption assures that the market price is well defined and trades may always
take place at the reservation price of a marginal purchaser as previously
8/
stated.

8/
Alternatively, we could assume that bonds are fixed in supply and some
investors are occasionally forced to trade for reasons unrelated to optimal
tax trading. "Liquidity purchasers" will never pay above their reservation
price because the discount bond is available. "Liquidity sellers," however,
may not be able to hold out for their reservation price.

The value of the bond to an investor, V(Y, t; C, T; P, t), is defined
as the present value of the stream of cash flows associated with the bond,
assuming that the optimal policy in realizing capital gains and losses is

followed. The symbols p and t denote the current cost basis and the time
at which the bond was purchased.

At those "stopping times" at which the investor either by choice or by
force sells the bond and realizes a capital gain or loss, the value to the

investor is simply the after—tax proceeds from its immediate sale. The bond's
maturity date is an obvious stopping time for all investors. At maturity, the
capital gain or loss is unavoidably realized, hence

The smooth-pasting condition is not imposed at those stopping times which

signify forced realizations. Forced realizations are assumed to be caused by
events exogenous to the model, e.g., an unanticipated and unavoidable need for

consumption or portfolio revision. Forced realizations are formally modelled

as Poisson arrivals with a constant force A. The Poisson process is
independent of the process which generates the movements of the state
variables.

For a marginal investor the time of purchase is also an optimal stopping

time since, by definition, he is indifferent to the purchase. Thus,

This condition of indifference provides the link between the value of the bond

and its market price. It may also be interpreted as an alternative description of the marginal investor. As we see below, (4a) need not hold for non—
marginal investors who either receive a surplus by purchasing the bond at the
prevailing price or find buying the bond to be dominated by lending at the
short—term rate.

At all other times, the investor's value of the bond exceeds the aftertax proceeds from immediate sale, and the investor optimally defers the

realization of a capital gain or loss. The set of states and times {,

4. An Example
In this section we begin to examine the value of the timing option regarding
the realization of capital gains and losses on bonds and to analyze the effect of

the capital gains tax on their pricing. To discuss these issues in the simplest
possible setting and through closed—form solutions, we make a number of
simplifying assumptions.

We assume that there is only one state variable, the short term rate of

interest, r, with movements determined by the stochastic differential equation

dr =

ctr2dt + sr3'12dw(t)

where dw(t) is the increment of the scalar Wiener process w(t).

short term interest rate, r, but is independent of the current time, t,
because the process generating interest rate movements is stationary.
We also assume that the. tax rates on all capital gains and losses are equal,

i.e., t =

r.

Thus the length of time over which the bond has been held is

irrelevant, and the consol's value to an investor, V(r; C; p), is also

independent of the current time, t. Finally, we assume away forced

realizations, i.e., A = 0.
It is easy to prove that any investor's optimal policy is to realize capital

losses immediately and defer capital gains indefinitely.
Given the basis,

P, the continuation region is defined by the range of interest rates such that
P(r; c) > P. In the continuation region the differential equation (9) becomes

Equation (21) shows that the price of a consol bond is increasing in the

capital gains tax rate of the marginal investor. A high capital gains rate
does not hurt the investor because he is never forced to realize gains and hi

optimal policy is to defer indefinitely the realization of capital gains. In
fact a high capital gains rate is a benefit because it enables him to obtain
larger tax rebates by realizing a capital loss whenever such a loss occurs.

Provided that forced realizations are not too frequent, the same conclusion
also applies to a finite maturity par bond, as indeed is demonstrated in the

numerical solutions of Section 6. If the bond currently sells at par, the
investor can be neutral to the capital gains tax by following the naive policy

of deferring both gains and losses. The intelligent policy of deferring gains
and realizing losses can only turn the taxation to his advantage, and he
therefore benefits by a high capital gains tax rate.

We observe that the bond price is increasing (decreasing) in the ordinary

income tax rate, if capital gains (losses) are expected. This indeterminancy
is due to the light taxation of capital gains relative to interest and coupon

income in this model. If capital gains are expected, the consol's current
coupon yield is less than the interest rate, and an increase in tc
represents a greater loss for potential holdings in the instantaneous bond
than in the consol.

We use two benchmarks to measure the value of the tax timing option. The

first is the price of the consol, H' in an economy where the marginal

investor follows a buy-and-hold policy. This benchmark is also the consol's
price in an economy with zero capital gains tax.

The buy—and—hold price is unaffected by the capital gains tax rate of
the marginal investor for the simple reason that no capital gains tax is ever
paid. This result differs from that reported in Constarttinides (1983) for
stocks. Although the tax liability is also postponed indefinitely for
equities, the expected rate of growth in price, adjusted for risk, equals the
discount rate so the present value of the tax liability is not negligible. In
our problem, the expected rate of growth in price ,yr, must be smaller than

Non—marginal investors need not value a potential purchase at the

price they pay for it. The valuation can be either more or less. Of course,
if they do buy, they must value the bond in excess of its price.

Since the bond's price is set by the marginal investor, only two
coefficients need to be determined for the non-marginal investor's problem.

These are determined by (13) and (18) giving

optimal trading. Thus, whefl the investor sells, he values not only the after
tax proceeds of the sale (p under the optimal strategy) but also the future
benefit in using this money to buy another bond. As in most problems with
heterogeneous taxes the non—marginal investor must be restricted in some
fashion to keep his tax liabiity above zero (or minus infinity if rebates are
given). The assumption here is that short term borrowing to finance the
purchase of consols is not permited, nevertheless the expectations hypothesis
holds.

(29)

There are two distinct tax effects. First, the larger the investor's
capital gains tax rate the greater is the surplus since losses provide larger

benefits. Second, when capital gains (losses) are expected, y > 0 (y < 0),
the larger (smaller) his ordinary tax rate, the greater the surplus. This
effect is the standard one of high tax investors' preference for capital

gains, observed even in buy—and—hold economies. Since the two tax rates are
positively related in a cross section of investors, the effects are enhancing
when capital gains are expected and opposing when capital losses are expected.
If the marginal holder of bonds is tax exempt, then there are no tax

effects on the consol's price. Nevertheless, even in this case equations (28)
and (29) reveal that many taxed investors may have a valuable timing option.
To measure the magnitude of the timing option we require estimates of the

parameters a and s and the marginal tax bracket. The current annual
riskless rate is approximately 11%. In using the Ibbotson and Sinquefield
(1982) study the reported annualized standard deviation of changes in the

short rate over the period 1926—1981 is 2.2%. Using equation (10) we. set s =

(0.022)(0.11)3/2 = 0.604.

In the same study the reported standard deviation

of annualized returns on long term U.S. Treasury bonds is 5.7%. If we take

this number as an estimate of the standard deviation of returns on a consol,

then using (23) we can approximate s

(0.O57)//.11 = .172.

Ibbotson and Sinquefield do not report the average change in the interest

rate so we somewhat arbitrarily examine the two cases a =

0

and a =

which correspond to no expected change in the interest rate and in the consol
price, respectively. If we choose to interpret a as a risk premium measure,
then under the assumption of no drift in the interest rate, the expected rate

of return on a consol is r(1 + ci).

Ibbotson and Sinquefield estimate that

investors expected on average a premium of 131 basis points on twenty-year

bonds. This gives an estimate for a of 0.44 based on the average interest
rate.

Table 1 displays the value of the timing option as a percentage of price

for these parameter values (equations (29a, b)). It also presents the surplus
to non—marginal investors as a proportion of price. The values presented are

for the marginal tax rates tC

For the higher variance process the timing option contributes a significant portion of the bond's value as measured against either benchmark. For
the lower variance process the timing option remains important except in the
case when large capital losses are expected and the continuous realization

Ibbotson and Sinquefield estimate based on a portfolio of long—
term bonds may be a downwardly biased estimate of the standard deviation of a
consol's rate of return for two reasons:
(a) They considered a portfolio of bonds with an average maturity of 20
years (not infinite).
(b) The variability of a portfolio of bonds generally underestimates the
return variability of each bond. For example, a shock in the economy which
raises the price of ten—year bonds and lowers the price of thirty—year bonds
may leave the portfolio's price essentially unchanged and contribute little to
the variability of the portfolio's return. The same shock, however, may have
a significant impact on the consol's return.
Both of our estimates of s, particularly the first, may also be
negatively biased because the interest rate was substantially less than 11%
for most of this period.

trading

on bond prices cannot safely be ignored in practice.

Examination of the levels of investor surplus indicates that clienteles
can be either sharp or weak, depending on the parameter values of the

stochastic interest rate process. The first column illustrates a very precise
marginal clientele when large capital gains are expected and the two tax

effects are strongly enhancing. The final column shows a somewhat weaker
clientele structure with a reversed ordering when the two tax effects are

opposing. The impact of the ordinary tax is greater in this case because the

(,tira1 Bond Trading--the General Case
We examine a discrete-time version of the model outlined in Section 3,

focusing

on the distinction between

short and long term gains and losses, the

effect of the amortization deduction and transactions costs. Since our
primary concern is on how optimal trading affects the bond prices, we confine

our

attention to the marginal bondholder.
19/

We assume that the trading interval is one year. If an asset is sold
one year after purchase, we assume that the holding period is short term or

long term at the investors discretion. Since the cutoff point is one year
after purchase, the investor can make the holding period long or short term,

19/
The choice of one year is primarily a matter of convenience,
coinciding with both the maximum holding period for short term losses and the
tax year.
If the holding period were shorter, as it was until recently, and
the offset provision is assumed to be binding, then an additional complication

results. The value of short—term losses in the first part of the year cannot
be determined until it is known
there are later offsetting long term
capital gains. This problem affects only tax scenario II, below.

if

27

by delaying or advancing the bond sale by only one day. By a simple dominance
argument, all capital gains are realized long term. Similarly whenever the
investor realizes a capital loss one year after purchasing the bond, he does
so short term.

We maintain our assumption that there are no forced realizations. On
each trading date the investor either holds his bond, deferring the
realization of a capital gain or loss, or sells his bond and immediately
repurchases it, thereby realizing a capital gain or loss and re-establishing a

short term status. The following set of factors determines whether the
investor holds his bond or executes a wash sale:

(a) If the bond price is below the basis, the investor would like to
sell the bond and receive the tax deduction immediately. The reason becomes
more compelling if the bond was purchased one year earlier, so that this is
the only chance to realize the capital loss short term.

(b) If the bond price is above the basis, the investor would like to
defer the realization of the capital gain and thereby defer the tax

liability. As stated previously, he never realizes a short term gain because
he can wait one more day. Nevertheless, he may wish to realize a long term
gain as explained in (c) and (d).

(c) A short term holding status is beneficial to the investor. This
status helps when he realizes a capital loss, because he realizes it short
term, and it never hurts, even when the investor realizes a capital gain,

because he can always wait one more day and convert to the long term status.
The short term status turns out to be a very important factor governing the

optimal liquidation policy. Under certain realistic conditions, an investor
may realize a capital gain solely to convert to the beneficial short term
status.

28

(d) The peculiar amortization rules on bonds introduce another twist to
this already complex problem. If the bond's basis is above par, this
difference is linearly amortized over its remaining term to maturity with the

"loss" applied against the investor's ordinary income. The present value of
this tax deduction is high for short maturity bonds, but decreases with longer

maturity, because of the linearity of the amortization rule. For short
maturity bonds the benefit in establishing a basis above par may be
sufficiently large to make it optimal to realize a capital gain.

We assume that the short term rate of interest, r, is the only state
variable and that it follows a driftless binomial random walk with two

reflecting barriers. We consider two specifications for the interest rate
process. In the low—variance process, the interest rate takes one of the
twenty—one values ,

.04,.05,.06,

...,

• 24.

If the interest rate equals any

of the interior values then at the next date it has the value r

.01, each

with probability one half. If the interest rate is equal to one of the endpoint values .04 or .24 then at the next date it remains unchanged or takes on

the value .05 or .23, respectively with probability one half. The reader may

verify that the unconditional distribution of r is uniform over the twentyone points. The standard deviation of changes in the interest rate is
std(r(t +

1)Ir(t))

= .01

per year, independent of the state (except in

the end-point states).. In the high-variance process, the interest rate takes

one of the eleven values,.04,.06,...,. 24. The probabilities are as in the
low—variance process and the reflecting barriers are at the levels .04 and

.24. The standard deviation of the changes in the interest rate in the high—

variance process is a = .02 per year. From the Ibbotson and Sinquefield
(1982) study, the annualized standard deviation of the short term rate is

.022. The low—variance process then underestimates the interest rate

29

variability, while the high-variance process reflects the average variability
in the period 1926—1981.

As we shall see, the low—variance process implies, on average, that the
standard deviation of the annual rate of return of 20—year Treasury Bonds is
5.66%, if priced under

the

buy—and-hold policy, and 5,82% if priced under

optimal policy with t = .25

the

(scenario I). For the high—variance process,

the corresponding numbers are 9.47% and 8.73%, From the Ibbotson and
Sinquefield (1982) study this standard deviation is 5.7% for long term

Treasury bonds over the 1926-1981 period. Therefore the low—variance process

Equivalently and more directly we obtain the bond price and the value of a

Equations (30) and (31) establish the bond price and value of a bond to

The value of the bond to an investor is the after—tax sale proceeds. By the
maturity date, the bond basis cannot exceed one, because the excess will have

however, the caveat in footnote (18). In addition, when the low—
variance process is used, the simulated volatility of a 20—year bond over its
life will be lower than the historic average because in the last part of its
life its price is more strongly affected by the short term rate so the
volatility is underestimated.

maturity, and the appropriate capital gains tax rate is the long term rate.
Thus,

(31)

•

With the terminal values established, the bond's price and its value to a
given investor at points in time prior to maturity can now be obtained through

dynamic programming. We distinguish between the cases in which amortization
is and is not utilized.

The bond price is what a marginal investor is willing to pay for it. His
alternative is investing in the short term asset over the next year in which

case his investment increases at the prevailing after-tax interest rate. He
is indifferent to buying the bond, therefore, only if the after-tax coupon and
amortization benefit plus the expectation of the value function next period is
greater than the current bond price by exactly the after tax foregone interest.
If the bond is selling today for less than par, then its price is the appropriate

basis in the value function. If the bond is priced above par, then (P -

t)

1)/(T

will be amortized in the next year, and the basis in the value function next

year is less than the prevailing price by this amount. Thus at time t

realization of a capital loss. If both the basis and the bond price are less
than one, the amortization feature is not in effect and the simple trading

rule is to realize a loss and defer a gain as indicated by daggers. If the
basis or the bond price exceeds one, the amortization feature becomes relevant
and complicates the rule.

For one—year bonds, if the bond sells at a premium, P > 1,

and the

basis is below the bond price, p < p, the investor realizes a capital gain
in order to establish a higher basis and benefit from the amortization of the

basis. For five—year bonds, the amortization benefit Is reduced and large

capital gains may be deferred. For example, if P = 1.10

and p = .8

.9, the investor realizes a capital gain; but if P = .7

the investor defers

or

the capital gain. The amortization benefit becomes negligible for twenty-year

bonds. For example, if P = 1.25

and p ( 1.2,

the investor optimally

defers the realization of a capital gain and thereby foregoes the amortization

benefit of increasing the basis to 1.25. In fact, if P

.88 and

p = 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3 the investor foregoes the amortization benefit and
realizes the capital loss.

Some of the entries in this table as well as those in Table 3 give the
value fmction for states which could never arise along the optimal path. For
example, since losses are always realized when the basis is below par, the
basis can never be substantially in excess of the current price in this
situation. These entries, therefore, give the value of changing to the
optimal policy from a suboptimal position.

Table 3 reports the bond price and values, V, for the high variance
interest rate process, for a range of interest rates and bases, and for

maturities 1, 5, and 20 years. Asterisks, daggers and double daggers mark the
states where the optimal policy is to perform a wash sale. Panel A reports
results when the bond has been held for longer than one year, t —

t > 1,

while panel B reports results when the bond has been held for just one year,

t = 1.

Note that the value function in the two panels can differ only

realized,

it is presumed to be long term so the taxes paid are the same. When

no wash sale occurs, the ensuing status must be long term regardless of the
current status.

These tables indicate that the investor performs a wash sale of long term
bonds practically every year in order to revert to the short term status.
This is emphasized by the double daggers which mark states in which a wash

sale is executed to this end alone. The desirability of the short term status
seems to dominate all other considerations.

III. Treasury bond held by a high-tax-bracket individual with 1 =

The optimal trading policy is quite simple and need not be illustrated in

a table. Whenever the bond price is above par and the basis, the investor
makes a wash sale to establish a higher basis and deduct from future ordinary

income the premium amortization. The investor has no tax incentives to
perform any other trades.

Again the optimal policy can be described without a table. The Investor
optimally realizes all capital losses and defers the realization of capital

gains. He never realizes a capital gain in order to establish a higher basis
with the benefit of the amortization deduction. The tax rate on ordinary income
is the same as that on capital gains so amortization "losses" at best exactly

offset the capital gain and occur later. Neither does he defer the realization
of a capital loss in order to maintain the benefit of the amortization
deduction.

6. Bond Prices and the Tax Timing (tion

Table 4

displays simulated Treasury bond prices that would be established

by the marginal investor, following the optimal trading policy under each of
the four tax scenarios. We assume that the current value of the short term
interest rate is 14%. For comparison, the 14% coupon bond would be priced just
above par if the marginal investor followed a buy-and-hold policy. The exact
buy—and—hold prices range from 1.002 to 1.071 for the high—variance process and

23/
from 1.001 to 1.030 for the low—variance process.

The prices which prevail under tax scenario II are uniformly higher than
those under scenario I since investors are not subject to the restrictive offset
provision of the tax code but can exploit in full their short term losses.
Furthermore, except for the bonds of five-year maturity, tax scenario II

— Buy-and—hold
23/

prices are computed with the formula (35) below. Even
though the interest rate is not expected to increase or decrease from 14%, the
yield curve is slightly downward sloping due to Jensen's inequality, and
prices are above par. For these and other premium bonds the buy—and—hold
policy assumes that the excess above par is amortized and deducted year by
year. Thus no capital losses (or gains) are earned on premium bonds under the
buy—and—hold policy. Therefore this benchmark price is the same for all
scenarios.

typically results in the highest price. We would expect the second scenario to
yield high prices because short

reasons.

First, for discount bonds the buy-and-hold price is highest under tax

scenario III since the guaranteed capitalgain escapes all taxation.

Second,

amortizable basis. For sufficiently short maturities these two effects

dominate.

A comparison of the pricing under scenarios I, III, and IV is also of

interest.

While their interpretation is radically different, they actually

differ in only one respect. The capital gain tax rates, both long and short

term, are .25, 0, and .5 respectively. All other taxes are the same. Scenario
III with the lowest tax

rate

has prices which are uniformly highest;

nevertheless, the high tax rate in scenario IV does not always induce the lowest

price. Again there is a tradeoff between the value of capital losses and the
cost of capital gains. The former is more important for the volatile longer
maturity bonds. The latter is more important for the shorter maturity bonds,
particularly those selling below par.
It is frequently asserted that discount bond prices are higher than what is
justified by the term structure of interest rates, reflecting the fact that a

portion of the return is realized as a lightly taxed capital gain. Our
discussion of Table 4 demonstrates that the above is just one of several tax

effects

on bond prices. The direction and magnitude of

the tax effect depends

36

critically on the tax scenario applicable to the marginal investor and on
whether the marginal investor follows a passive or optimal trading policy.
We now turn our attention to the tax timing option, defined as

the

difference between the bond prices under the optimal and buy-and-hold

24/
policies.

Table 5 reports the value of the timing option as a percentage of

the bond price under the optimal policy. In each case the buy-and-hold price is
calculated using the corresponding long term capital gains tax rate (.25, .25,
0, .5). If this price is above par,. the amortization is deducted every year.
Thus no capital losses (or gains) are earned under the buy—and-hold policy for

premium bonds, and the benchmark price is the same for all scenarios. For
discount bonds the buy—and—hold prices vary across the scenarios and are

inversely related to the long term capital gains tax rate. The timing option
varies widely for different coupon rates, maturities, and tax scenarios, but in
most cases it represents a substantial fraction of the bond price just as the
example in section 4 illustrates.

The one exception is deep discount bonds.under tax scenario III. Here the
timing option is worth little since there is only a small probability of ever

amortizing a premium and no other tax trading benefit is possible. For bonds
selling near or above par, however, the timing option is more important under

tax scenario III than under scenarios I or IV. The binding deduction limit
under scenario III is a mixed blessing. On the one hand the individual may not
obtain tax rebates from the government by realizing capital losses. On the

— An
24/

alternative definition of the timing option is the difference
between the bond prices under the optimal and continuous realization
policies. The two definitions are compared in the example of Section 4.
Since the interest rate dynamics employed here are without drift, the results
are most similar to the case a = 0 in the continuous time model. The buy—
and—hold benchmark resulted in smaller timing options in that case so our
choice is conservative.

37

other hand he can costlessly realize capital gains in order to raise the basis
and take advantage of the amortization deduction.

The reported values show that the tax timing option is typically increasing

in maturity. This is due to both the increased value of standard options when
their maturities are lengthened and the greater volatility of the longer

maturity bonds underlying these options. This feature explains why the 25- and
30—year 10% coupon bonds are mor.e expensive than those with 10— to 20—year

maturities even though the interest rate is above the coupon rate at 14% and the
yield curve is essentially flat.

Although longer maturity bonds generally have more valuable timing options,
it does not follow that a larger tax subsidy flow is available on long bonds.
For example, holding two 15—year bonds in succession may provide greater total

tax benefit than a single 30—year bond provides. One way to compare the
benefits of different maturity bonds is to express the timing option on an

annualized basis. The maturity of bonds with the largest annualized benefits
would then represent the natural "habitat" of investors particularly concerned

with tax benefits. The annualized tax subsidy on a T-year bond is

approximately r(1 -

t)/[1

— exp(—r(1 —

t)T)]

per dollar value of the tIming

option. Using this approximation we establish that the lowest annual subsidy is
on short maturity bonds. On bonds with ten or more years to maturity the
benefits are fairly constant, regardless of the tax scenario.
Annualizing the timing option also permits us to normalize the tax benefits

relative to the rate of return earned on the bond. For example, under the four
scenarios tax benefits provide on average 7, 32, 18 and 10 percent,
respectively, of the total return expected on the 25—year, 14% coupon bond.

We have so far ignored transactions costs. A bid—ask spread or other costs
of trading will reduce the value of the timing option since the optimal policies

38

involve

substantially more trading than the buy-and-hold policy. Constantinides

has examined the optimal tax trading policy on stocks in the presence of
proportional transactions costs.

25/
In a simple continuous—time lognormal model

he found that investors should not realize losses immediately, but should wait

until the price falls to a specific fraction of the basis. A similar rule
applies to our

model in section 4. The modifications to the optimal trading

policies of the models here are more complicated, but the basic idea remains the

game: Trades are deferred until capital gains and losses are larger than in the
absence of transactions costs.

Table 6 displays the value of the timing option when trading is costly.
The round—trip transaction cost is represented by a bid—ask spread of 0.2, 0.5
or 1.0 percent of par.

26/
The timing option retains a large fraction of its

value even with sizeable transactions costs. Bonds of ten or more years to
maturity retain at least half of the original timing option even with one

percent transactions costs. The reduction may

not

be as large as we might have

expected because transactions costs are not entirely a dead weight loss. The
cost of purchase is added to the basis while the cost of sale is deducted from

the sales proceeds. Effectively, the taxing authority subsidizes the costs of
trading.

never give up more than 40 percent. At thirty-year maturities the examined

The Tax—Adjusted Yield Curve

and Implied Tax Bates

We demonstrated that bond prices set by the marginal investors following
the optimal trading policy are markedly different from those set under a buy—

and—hold or continuous—realization policy. In this section we explore the
inlications of these differences when interest rate and tax bracket estimates
are inferred from market prices.

Previous authors typically have assumed that a particular marginal investor

Given a set of bond prices, the resulting set of equations (35) can be

Their estimates of the marginal tax bracket for the year 1968 range from 37.5%
to 50%, depending on the pair of bonds used (and disregarding the cheapest
flower bond).

McCulloch (1975) also assumes t

L

however, he does not require

a flat term structure. Instead, he estimates the tax bracket and a cubic
spline

for the discount function to minimize a weighted sum of the squared

deviations between actual and modeled prices. Using data from 1963-1966 he
concludes

that "the effective tax rate that best explains the prices of U.S.

Treasury securities lies somewhere in the range .22 to .33." For new data
from 1973 the best estimate of the tax rate is only .19.

Pye (1969) estimates the tax bracket of the marginal bondholder using
various combinations of discount and

par, taxable and exempt bonds. The

analysis closest to ours compares par and moderately discounted taxable

bonds. Pye

concludes

that the effective tax rate at the margin varies between

10% and 36% over the period 1967—1968.

Our

analysis

provides a possible explanation of this finding. If bond

prices are set by investors who follow an optimal trading policy, estimates of
the yield curve and the margi nal tax bracket obtained under the assumption of

a naive buy—and-hold policy may

be

biased. To test for bias, we generate a

sanple of simulated bond prices under the assumptiOn of optimal trading

policies with known tax rates and yield curves. We then estimate the yield

tax rate is estimated to be negative.

The errors are usually smaller for the low—variance process, as wewould
expect, since the timing option then has less value and buy-and-hold prices

are more accurate. For the same reason, errors are smaller when the deep
discount bonds are used in the estimation.

The estimates are generally most accurate under tax scenario I. Again
this corresponds to the case when the timing option has the least value. Tax
scenario II yields very poor results as does scenario III when near par bonds

used. Tax scenari.o IV i.s interesting because the Implied tax bracket Is

While the errors in the forward rates are often large, the computed

numbers

are almost invariably within one standard deviation of both the

true forward rate and the single—period rate expected to prevail at the

forecast time. Consequently, verifying the induced tax trading bias i.n the
forward rates would require a large sample of data. Furthermore, even with

large amounts of data available, the errors probably could not be

error in the estimated forward rate is the deviation between the

Municipal Bonds
The

Treasury

tax treatment of municipal bonds differs from the tax treatment of
and corporate bonds i.n two important respects. First, coupon income

on municipal bonds is exempt from Federal tax. Second, if

the

purchase price

in the secondary market is above par this excess must be amortized but the
amortized amount is not allowed as a deduction, even though the bond's tax
basi.s is correspondingly reduced. In effect the taxation of bond coupons and

of premium amortization are symmetric: for Treasury bonds, the coupons and
premium amortization are taxed at the individual's marginal tax rate on

ordinary

income; for municipal bonds the coupons and premium

amortization

remain untaxed.
Coupon income on municipal bonds

calculations

may be

subject to state tax, but in

our

we ignore state taxes. We consider this a good first approxi-

mation for two reasons. Many states exempt from state tax the coupons on
bonds issued by municipalities within the state so the marginal holders of
such bonds may well be exempt front taxes. Also, while state tax rates vary
widely across states, they are generally very low relative to the Federal tax
30/
rates of investors who would consider holding municipal bonds.

30/
—
As of 1980 seven states had no individual income tax on interest. More
than half the states had maximum marginal tax rates at or below 7%. In only
three states was the maximum tax rate above 11%. The highest rate was

Minnesota's

16%.

44

The main difference between the optimal trading policies for municipal

and taxable bonds is that no trades are ever made at a price above par since

there is no advantage in establishing an amortizeable basis. Since this is
the only trading advantage of taxable bonds under tax scenario III, the value
of the timing option on municipal bonds l.s zero i.n this scenario. At the

opposite extreme is tax scenario IV. In this case it is never optimal to
establish an above par basis ona taxable bond, so the right to amortize such
a basis contributes nothing to the value of the timing option. Thus under
scenario IV, the value of the timing option on a municipal bond is equal to
that on a taxable bond with the same after—tax coupons (i.e., before-tax

coupons 1/(1 —

r)

times as large). Under tax scenarios I and II the timing

option on municipal bonds is less valuable than the option on couponequivalent taxable bonds.

Table 9 presents the value of the timing option on municipal bonds. When
municipals are deep discount, the timing

option under scenarios

I and II is

nearly as valuable as on coupon—equivalent taxable bonds. The same i.s true on
short maturity municipals even if the di scount is small. These, of course,

are the cases when the right to amortize the basis In the future has

negligible value. On premium municipal bonds the timing option is substantially smaller than on coupon equivalent taxables, especially if the

comparison is made between short maturity bonds. For example, under tax
scenario II the timing option on short-maturity municipals is one—third as
large as the timing option on short—term taxables; the timing option on longterm municipals is one—half as large as the timing option on long—term

taxab].es.

concluding

Remarks

This paper extended the work of Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1981, 1983) on
valuing bonds

and

combined it with the work of Constantinides (1982, 1983) and

Constantinides and Scholes (1980) on optimal trading policies. We determined
that of the tax timing option is an important fraction of the bond price.

We also discussed how the price distortion affects standard estimation
techniques for extracti.ng interest rates and marginal tax brackets from

observed bond prices. We found the implied errors to be substantial.
Although we focused on the value of the timing

bondholder, we did

illustrate

option

to the marginal

in one case that the optimal trading policy

differs from the buy—and—hold or continuous realization policy for all taxed

investors. Thus, even if the marginal investor is tax exempt, the timing
option has positive value to other bondholders.

Our paper only examined the case when the tax bracket of the marginal

bondholder remains unchanged. That Is,

investo may buy and sell the bond

in the course of the optimal trading policy, but the bond remains In the hands

of investors in the same tax bracket throughout its term to maturity. The
next step should be to recognize the existence of tax clienteles as in
Schaefer (1981); but unlike Schaefer, to explore the implications of the
bondholders' following optimal trading policies and of the bond being passed
from one tax bracket investor to another as its maturity shortens or as it
changes from a discount to a premium bond.

the high—variance process with standard deviation of 0.02 per year. Asterisks,
daggers, and double daggers mark the states in which the optimal policy is to
perform a wash sale. In each case, one of the benefits is reestablishing a
short term holding status. Asterisks and double daggers indicate the realization
of .a long term capital gain. The former also denote the establishing of a new or

higher amortizable basis. Daggers Indicate the realization of a long or short
