The Economy of Israel

ABSTRACT

The paper

Israeli

opens with

a description of the salient features of the

economy. These consist of a large government sector

(the governnnt

budget has absorbed riore than 80% of GNP in some recent years); high levels

of defense spending; a large government budget deficit; a large current
account deficit (about 20% of GNP); triple digit inflation; and extensive
indexation of beth wages and long
nodel

term financial

conimitrrents. A descriptive

of the econany is then presented, which includes the particular

asset menu of the Israeli economy, and its properties examined. Finally,

the rrodel is used in analyzing aspects of the Israeli inflationary experience.
The currency liberalization of 1977, which increased the access of Israelis

to

foreign assets, shares respensibility for the high rate of inflation. The

pessibilities

of ending

the inflation are discussed.

THE ENCM{ OF ISRAEL

Stanley Fischer*

From 1953 to 1973 real GD? in Israel grew at an annual rate of

nearly 10%; over the next nine years the grewth rate us only 3%, as
Table 1 shows.' Fran 1953 to 1973, the average inflation rate (CPI)
was 7.1%; fran 1973 to 1979 the inflation rate averaged iore than 40%;

arid in the last three years the annual inflation rate has been in

the

triple digit range.
The aims of this paper are to describe the structure and
pert ornnce of the Israeli economy, and to account for the worsening 01

its inflation perfonnce over the last decade. We begin with a
description of the current state and structure of the economy.

The Inflationary Economy.
GNP per capita in Israel at the end of 1981 s about $5500, 45% of
the United States level, roughly at the levels of Greece, Singapore, and
Ireland
level.

2 Per capita consumption is also about 45% of the United

States

P is around $22 billion.

The Structure of Dennd: Table 2 provides a first perspective on
some special features of the Israeli economy. The consumption and
investment shares in GNP are not out of the ordinary. But government
consumption

is extremely high; the average for the

OEXD countries is

30%. The

17%, with the share even in the case of Sweden being less than
openness of the economy is shown

by the large shares of both exports and

imports in GNP, and the balance of trade problem by the rrgnitude of the
import

surplus.3

The dominant role of government and the magnitude of the government

budget deficit are clearly revealed by Table 3,

which is based

data. Over the past five years government has on

more than 70% of

average disposed of

GNP and received more than half of GNP in revenues.

The budget deficit has

averaged

more than 20% of GNP. Fiscal year

shows the effects of the war in Lebanon, with government

expenditures reaching an extraordinary 90% of GNP, and

tax

revenues

exceeding half of GNP as a result of revenue measures imposed in mid—
1982.

It can

be seen that defense spending accounts for most

government consumption. The

is that

resources devoted to defense may be 50% more than the amourt estimated

in the accounts.4

Israeli residents ny hold assets with returns indexed to either the
price level or the exchange rate. They have also been entitled since
the 1977 liberalization to hold foreign bank accounts and foreign

liabilities corresponding to most of the non—equity financial assets
owned by the private sector. Thu reserve requirement for the banks
against foreign currency linked deposits is 90%; and the indexation
provided by private institutions is based on their holdings of
government indexed liabilities. Thus the government's daninance in the

allocation of resources extends to the capital markets; indeed, most
private investment is financed with government assistance.

Wage iudexatioa is included as part of

the

contract negotiated

between the Histadrut (trade union organization) and the Manufacturers'
Association. These agreements, typically biennial, cover most of the

labor force. The frequency and

details

of cost of living adjustments

have varied over the years. Currently the adjustments are made
three months, with compensation for inflation varying with the

every

inflation rate. For instance, if the quarterly inflation rate is less
than 20%, there is 80% compen.tion for inflation; if the inflation
rate

is more than 30%, compensation is 90%. It is also agreed that

ther: will be nego1tions between the Histadrut and the umployers if
the real wage falls.8

5This is iinly defense spending. Note that total government
pirc'iases of goods nd services, (l+12)447 01 GNP, is well
above the 33% recorded as government consumption in Table 1.

The difference is accounted for by government investment

activities, and by the fact that government consumption in
1.981 s 39.1% of GNP.

6 Transfers to the national institutions, such as the Jewish
Agency, equal to 2.1% of GNP, not recorded as foreign income
of the government.

5

Subsidies recorded in line 3 are for the purchase of goods and
services.
In addition, the government provides extensive subsidies to

borrowers, scrne recorded in line 4. However, the major subsidization
of credit has occurred through the provision of low nominal

interest

loans; the Bank calculates the subsidy element in such credit during
1981 at nearly 7% of GNP. This amount is noted in Table
included

6, but

not

in any of the budget totals. The provision of low nominal

interest rate credit since 1979 has been in the process of being phased
out and replaced

by indexed

loans.11

The government finances its activities mostly through taxation.
The largest revenue generators are the income tax and value added tax,
which in 1981 raised 18.1% and 5.2% of GNP respectively. National

GNP. There is an impressive

other taxes. In addition, as Table 6 shows, U.S. government

grants provide a substantial

proportion of

the financing for government

spending.

At this point, the logical step is to explain how the deficit of
19.4% of GNP in Table 6 was financed in 1981, through external
borrowing, domestic borrowing in the form of both price level and
exchange rate linked assets, and the creation of high—powered money.

Regrettably

data difficulties now become significant. The IMF presents

the data contained in Table 7a, for fiscal year 1981/2, which begins

April 1. The deficit before foreign grants in that period was nearly

23% of GNP. Foreign grants and loans financed more than half of that

amount. Domestic borrowing amounted to 10% of GNP, a large jrt of
that

from the Bank of Israel. The difference between entries 7 and 8

Table 7b presents Bank of Israel data on government finance. The
data are much less clean than those of the IMF. The Bank does not
present a comprehensive table on the financing of the government
deficit,

concentrating instead on financing of the domestic component

of the deficit, defined as the deficit that arises from the
government's activities in the domestic economy. As can be seen, there
is a significant difference between the estimates of the domestic
deficit

in

Tables 6 and 7b. Bather than dwell on these difficulties, I

note that it appears that sales

of

both bonds and foreign exchange,

in

approximately equal amounts, provide most of the financing for the

domestic deficit. Nonetheless, the increase in the money base accounts
for the financing of a significant component of government spending-—
about 2.5% of GNP.1 2 Even though the monetary base in 1931 was under
3.5% of GNP, large amounts of

revenue can

inflation 13
Part B of Table 7b attempts to account for the foreign component
of

the deficit. The government sector borrowed heavily abroad, using

the

proceeds both to pay for government imports and to sell to domestic

residents. In this account too

there

remains a sizeable discrepancy,

part of which may result from capital gains on the Bank of Israel's
holdings of foreign reserves. Adding parts A and B of Table 7b, we

find the general outlines confirm those of Table 7a, which applies to

fiscal year 1981. In both Table 7a and 7b it appears that foreign and

The service account is large on both the import and

export side, and is close to being balanced. Note that the balance on
goods and services in 1981 was just less than gross investment. It can
be said——though not accurately——that Israel's investment spending is

financed from abroad.

Table 9 examines the financing of the current account deficit and

details of aid. Unilateral transfers, governmental and private, cover
most of the deficit on net goods and services account. Unilateral
transfers

to the government are American government grants. About half

a billion dollars is received by the national institutions, primarily

the Jewish Agency, as a result of donations by world Jewry. Farther

dollars; these restitution payments are made directly to individuals.

rate has since 1977 been on a very dirty 'float. The

Bank of Israel intervenes in the market continuously, and occasionally
attempts to stabilize the inflation rate by causing the exchange rate

to appreciate. The reform of 1977 liberalized

the capital

account,

permitting free capital flows and also the holding of 'foreign assets by

danestic residents.15 Subsequently the authorities have intervened to

affect capital movements. Qe intervention took the form of a tax on
capital imports, imposed in 1979 when domestic tight monetary policy
raised interest races and caused an undesired (by the authorities)
capital inflow.

Monetary Policy: Monetary policy in Israel is constrained by two
factors: first, real interest rates on index bonds are inflexible and
determined legislatively; and second, political pressures make it

difficult to allow the real exchange rate to move freely. Neither
constraint is absolute. First, it is only the yield on new bonds that
is fixed by legislation, and the Bank of Israel can intervene in the

secondary

market to attempt to move the yield on bonds. In

practice

interventions are directed chiefly to stabilizing the price of
bonds. Second, the real exchange rate is sometimes allowed to
its

change 16

Given

the

the constraints under which it works, the

Bank has not in

recent inflationary period pursued money growth targets. It has

pursued credit targets, by limiting the amount of credit banks can

provide

their customers. Strict credit targets and controls were in

9

effect in 1979. At that time the targets were partially specified in
Israeli

the

currency terms, and partially in foreign

currency. This meant

nominal targets adjusted automatically for exchange rate changes.

But this was not the major hole in the credit constraint; it was

instead the availability of subsidized export credits. Up to the time
of the' 1979 credit freeze and squeeze, the export credits had not been

fully utilized.

The Goals of Policy: Israeli policyinakers have generally given

first
over

priority to reducing

the balance of payments deficit. Cbncern

inflation has mounted in recent years, but has not been sufficient

to induce tough anti—inflationary policies. There were in the 1970's
two major episodes of contractionary policy, in 1975—76 and 1979—80,
each of which was aimed mainly at the balance of payments deficit, but
with the implied effects on the inflation rate clearly being welcome.

In both cases there was

a

significant reduction in the balance of

10

payments

deficit, but less effect on the inflation rate.

The liberalization of foreign exchange holdings in 1977 was

followed a year later by the transition to triple digit inflation. The
role, if any, of the liberalization in the increase in the inflation
rate will be discussed below.
The most ambitious attempt to reduce the payments

deficit

and the

inflation rate was undertaken in 1979 by a newly appointed finance

minister, who

partly

directed

his

efforts at

reducing the budget deficit,

through freezing government employment and partly through

removing purchase subsidies. At the same time, the Bank of Israel was

to constrain credit growth. The policy began to work by increasing
unemployment in early 1980, the balance of payments deficit narrowed,

but there was no quick impact on the inflation rate. The restrictive
policies were extremely unpopular, and with an election expected, the

finance minister was replaced by the present minister.
The new minister argued that supply side policies would reduce the

inflation rate, and claimed to iiçlement

them

by reducing import

tariffs and increasing subsidies. In the judnent of political
observers, the policies were successful at turning around an election
that had seemed lost by the government. There has been no subsequent

sign that the government is willing or interested in reducing inflation
if there is a price-—in terms of forgone output—-to be paid.
The prolonged period since Qtober 1982 during which the real
exchange rate has been appreciating as part of an anti—inflationary
policy
been

is unusual

in that the balance of payments goal of policy has

sacrificed to the inflation goal. The preference for attempting

to stabilize

inflation by manipulating the exchange rate without

11

pursuing other contractionary policies reflects the

unwillingness

of policy—makers in the period since

general

1973 to stabilize

the inflation rate by reducing aggregate demand and causing
unemployment.
Model

In this section I outline a descriptive model of the Israeli
economy based on the post—1977 strucutre of the financial system, that

I believe captures the main mechanLsn in the operation of the economy.

The model is presented both as an attempt to provide a concise

description of the economy, and because it is used in Section III to
guide the discussion of the causes of the current inflation and
pcsuible methods o1

reducing

the inflation rate.

The Structure of the Model.

The Assets I&.rkets: There are four assets: money; domestic price
level (CPI) indexed bonds; foreign currency denominated securities; and

equity claims to the returns on physical capital. Money is denominated

in shekels and pays no interest. In the model v assume all money is a
government liability; we thus omit inside shekel-denominated
deposits.17

Index bonds are liabilities of the government. We assume

linkage is 100%, although formally some bonds have less than complete

linkage.18 1iysical capital (or the equity claims on capital's
returns) is assumed to be a perfect portfolio substitute for index
bonds.19
Israeli

domestically
latter

residents may hold both foreign securities and
issued exchange rate linked securities. In form, the

are bank liabilities but because the reserve requirement against

such deposits is 90%, v, treat them as a liability of the government.

currency linked securities.

Equations (1) througi (3) are suppi equals den.nd conditions for

assets respectively. The stock budget constraint ensures that the
three equations are linearly dependent. The assets are assumed to be

13

An

increase in output increases the demand for money for

transactions purposes and therefore must, by

constraint,

the

stock budget

reduce the demand for at least one of the other assets.

Since foreign—currency linked deixsits are sneLiiiies

used as

medium

of

exchange, we assume that the demanJ for bonds and capital falls when
the level of output rises, sthile the effect on the demand for foreign

currency linked securities of a rise in output is allowed to be either

positive or negative. The demand for each asset increases with
wealth.

Fquatton

(4)

states that the expected real yield on capital is

to the real yield on index bonds. This condition reflects the
assumption that the two assets are perfect portfolio substitutes. The
equal

marginal

stock

product of capital is assumed to decrease with

the capital

and increase with the level of output.

The Goods Market: There is a single domestically produced good,

with aggregate supply function:

The term following the coefficient a1 represents the effects of
indexing: actual past inflation affects today's rate of wage increase.

So too does anticipated inflation, to an extent that depends on how
much compensation will occur through indexation. Indexed wage
adjustments in practice take p!.ace every three months.

The third term on the right hand side represents the pressure of
demand on the wage. When output is expected to be above the full
employment level, y*, wages rise more rapidly.

When there has been unanticipated inflation in the past, with the

coefficient a1 less than unity, some catch-up of real wages will ocur.
These catch—ups occur mainly at the bargaining over base wages between
the Histadrut (Labor Federation) and the employers. We represent them

Although a change in the stock of bonds has an uncertain effect on

the real

exchange rate that clears the assets markets (4-

words, expansionary rionetary policy causes

the exchange rate to depreciate. A swap of domestic
currency

for foreign

denominated bonds, increasing B while reducing F, reduces q

and increases e/p. This open market operation corresponds to

sterilized intervention in the foreign exchange market.
Under the assumption that bonds and capital are perfect portfolio
substitutes, an open market swap of bonds for capital can have real

effects only if the return on capital differs depending on whether it

arises because an increase in

output

increases the

demand for money, thereby causing a currency appreciation

through the assets markets, and a reduction in production costs. We
assume this effect is not large enough to cause the AS curve to be
negatively sloped.

On the aggregate demand side, all the channels through which an
increase in the price level affect aggregate demand operate in the same

direction: an increase in the price level reduces aggregate demand. We
assun that an increase in output creates an excess supply of goods,
despite some ambiguities arising from asset market effects of an
increase in output.26

The intersection of the aggregate demand

and supply curves

determines the price level and domestic output. Given expectations,
the foreign interest rate, and the stock variables, the joint

equilibrium

of

the

assets and goods markets

determines the price level

(p) and output (y), the exchange rate (e), the relative price of
installed capital (a), and the rca'. interest rate (rB).
The exchange rate is accordingly determined by the interaction of

the goods and assets markets, without direct reference to the external

sector. But of course expectations of future exchange rates and the

levels of stocks of foreign assets affect the current exchange rate,

An

q both increase aggregate demand, shifting the AD curve to

which has so

by concentrating on

goods and assets markets. The government budget constraint implies
that a money stock increase has to be accompanied by some other policy

change.28 For instance, the change could be an increase in government

spending, or cut in taxes. In this case, output and

An Open Market Purchase: An open mat ket purchase of bDnd3 has the

saii qualitative effects as are shown in Figure 5. Both q and

rise

in the assets markets, shifting the aggregate demand and supply curves
as shown. Both output and

the

price level rise.

In discussing such an operation, we assume that expectations of

inflation, of the rate of change of the exchange rate, and of the rate
of change of q, do not change. But given the change

in

the composition

of the government debt, expectations will adjust. These effects are
discussed below.

liberalization thus need not have created any major short—run

disturbances to the economy except——and this is a major exception-—

through expectaions. But the liberalizatio..i a carried out dd affect
the goods markets directly. The liberalization was accompanied by the
removal of tariffs and export subsidies and by a 50% devaluation that
was intended to maintain the effective exchange rate fixed. Assuming
the effective exchange rate unchanged, the supply curve would not have

shifted as a result of the devaluation. But because there were preexisting foreign currency denominated assets, the 50% devaluation had a
large wealth effect, shifting up the aggregate demand curve and causing

the

price level to

rise. There was thus an iirnediate expansionary

from the liberalization—cum--devaluatiofl.

In addition, and not less important, the liberalization by causing

required higher rates of inflation to produce the same amount of
revenue from seigniorage.

The External Sector: The trade account is completely determined

within each period by the level of output and the real exchange rate.
The service account is predetermined. An open market purchase that
causes a depreciation and expansion of output has ambiguous effects on

the trade account: the real depreciation tends to increase net exports
while the rise in domestic income tends to decrease net exports.
A fiscal expansion (not studied above) unambiguously increases the

current account deficit.

with given ratios of real balances to bonds and government issued
foreign currency liabilities. These ratios can be assumed to be

Similarly, the relationship between the growth rate of output and

was in Israel up to 1972——there is no difficulty

borrowing generates ever increasing burdens on the budget over time.

period at about 12%, roughly the ratio

that was maintained from 1955 until the implementation of the

liberalization in 1977. Table 10 shows a sharp reduction in the ratio
of monetary base to income-—which is the base of the inflation tax——

starting in 1979. This shift followed the liberalization with a lag.

it possible that the current amount of seigniorage—about 2% of

GNP—could be obtained at a lower inflation rate? In other words, is
the economy on the slippery side of the laffer curve? That obviously
depends on the inflation elasticity of the demand for the monetary

base. If the ratio of base to incat

financial sophistication has increased rapidly since 1977, it is
doubtful that the system would return to a base to income ratio of 10%,
nearly double the current U.S. ratio.
Thus a reduction in the inflation rate would have

to be

accompanied by a reduced reliance on seigniorage by the government.

Is the Inflation Tax Negative? It is often asserted that the
inflation tax

in

Israel is negative. Table 11 shows the calculation:

the tax on the holdings of monetary base is more than offset for the
private sector by the fall in the value of its nominal liabilities to

the government. The point made by the table is that a marginal 1% of
inflation increases private sector wealth. The effect was at a maximum
in 1979 and is gradually becoming less important as the government
stops providing non—indexed loans to the private sector.

Table 11 shows that the real balance effect would be negative in

Israel. That is, if economic agents regard their liabilities to the

government as liabilities, then their wealth wou increase wh€n the
price level increases. It does not necessarily follow that an increase
in the money stock would produce negative revenue for the government.32
An increase of one shekel in the money stock would in the first
instance provide one shekel's worth of resources to the government.
The subsequent negative effects, suimnarized in Table 11, would have to

be deducted from the initial positive effect. But it does appear from

table that

the effect through subsidized credit is so large—or was

so large until

recently——that an increase in the money stock would have

reduced the present discounted value of government revenue.

This

of course

brings to the fore the basic question about the

29

Israeli.

inflation: why

does

the government persist in policies that

produce such high rates of inflation? With nothing obviously gained by
continuing inflation, why not stop it? We return to this question
below.

The Balance of Payments and the Foreign Debt.
The

balance of

payments has

been the

major preoccupation

of

Israeli policymakers for the past three decades. Figure 6 and Table 12
show net exports for the period since

The foreign deficit has

been in the range of 20% of GNP for most of the period, with a sharp
increase taking place following the Ycn Kippur War and associated oil
shock.

As noted by i.rni(1979), there are two

standard

argurients for the

case that the large import surplus is undesirable. The first is that
the accompanying accumulation of foreign debt places an undue burden on

future generations. The second is that the magnitude of the deficit
and the need to rely on external financing, some of it in the fona of
grants, makes or excessive vulnerability to outside pressure, economic

and political.
Table 13 presents data on the extent of the external debt. The
gross debt passed the $20 billion mark in the third quarter of 1982.
The net debt at the end of 1982 was equal to 63% of GNP or 1.4 times

the value of exports. With a real interest rate of 5%, the annual
interest cost of the debt would be above 3.0% of GNP. This would be

a

amount in steady state. But the ratio of the net foreign
debt to GNP is growing because of the size of current account deficits

financed through borrowing. By the end of 1982 net debt service
amounted

to

nearly 25% of exports and more than 10% of GNP.

significant increase in the import surplus in the mid—7OTs was defense

related (the rest was oil). Borrowing would be optimal if the current

defense burden were transitory. But if the current rate of defense
spending were to continue, it would become necessary to curtail
borrowing

The

concern over vulnerability to foreign pressure resulting from

the import surplus and the magnitude of the foreign debt is a real one.

It

is also a very old concern. (See Halevi and Kiinov—Malul (1968)).

Such pressures have been

brought

to bear

in the past, though the abrupt

cut—off of aid that has been the primary fear of policymakers has not

happened. If it were to happen, the access of the Israeli government
and private sector to international capital markets would be curtailed;
there would be major disruption o the economy anc a reduction in the

standard of living.
At least for this reason, successive Israeli governments have
sought to bring about a reduction of the import surplus.36 The level
of exports has risen rapidly relative to GNP, as Figure 6 and Thble 12
show. The economy succeeded in moving resources into the export sctor

through a variety of incentives, including subsidized export credits,
and recently, exchange rate insurance. Although the level of Imports
has risen along with exports, and the basic 20% of GNP import surplus

renains, the private sector import surplus has been reduced—defense
imports have risen as a share of GNP.

Inflation and Other Trends in the Israeli Economy.
•..

The

economy described in the first part; of this paper is very

different from the Israeli economy in, say, 1960. In that year
government expenditure was less than 30% of GNP, the government budget

deficit (IFS definition), was 4% of GNP the CPI was 2% higher than in
the previous year; only the import surplus, at 18% of GNP, was at a
modern level. It was the import surplus that was the radn cause of the

restrictive fiscal and monetary policies that produced the 1966—67
recession, which as we have seen in Figure 6 did improve the current
account. The question is, what happened after 160?

1973, the Israeli economy

also experienced much slor growth than before. Part of the

decline in the growth rate is a result of slower accumulation of

factors of production (Bruno, 1983) and part a result of a fall in
productivity growth. The heavy pressure of defense and government

spending has resulted in a reduction in investment spending, and the

labor force hui be growing slowly. But productivity growth has
fallen more rapidly in Israel than in other countries. The reason for
this is not clear, though doubtless some blame attaches to the high

inflation

that

has moved resources into the financial sector.37

Stabilization Policy: The model presented above indicated that

there is nothing particularly mysterious about the operation of either
monetary or fiscal policy in a heavily indexed economy like the Israeli

one, with its unusual menu of assets. Restrictive monetary or fiscal

that a big

Similarly, the attempt to use subsidies to stabilize scme nominal
prices leads to large increases in the budget deficit, and eventually
to the lifting of the subsidies and more inflationary pressure.

There is one final question. The inflation rate is not a major

issue in Israel. It is talked about, but there is no grounds1l of

public

insistence that the rate be reduced. Indexation of pensions,

long term savings, and wages, cover most of the difficulties that

would

face an unsophisticated economic agent living in an economy with a high

37

and variable rate of inflation. The question is: why disinf late?

recession during %thich unemployment reached double digits and

there as net emigration has burned as deep a concern about
unemployment in the memory of policymakers and the public as the Great

Depression did in the United States.

The arguments for undergoing the .in of disinflation have not
been established. It has frequently been asserted that the low growth

of

the seventies in Israel is a result of the high and variable

inflation, which draws resources into non—productive activities like

banking, and which distorts the price mechani. But the productivity
slowdown

is a worldwide phenanenon, which has take.a place in low

inflation as 1l as high inflation countries. A convincing
demonstration that it is indeed the inflation that is responsible for
low growth would make the case for disinflation.

In

1982 the

banks were encouraged to offer high nominal interest rate

time deposit accounts to increase the dnand for nominal assets. At
the name time, the tax treatment of nominal interest was adjusted to

ensure only real interest s taxed. Accordingly the share of non-4ft
nominal assets rose from 1.3% to 2% of financial assets. In April
1.983 a 1% tax

was imposed on the turnover of foreign currency linked

assets, also with the aim of increasing the dnand for shekel
denominated assets.

net wealth of

the non—financial private sector for the end of

1981 was estimated by the Bank of

Israel to be a little above 4 times

housing stock and value of plant and equipnent account for most of the

excess of net wealth over financial wealth as recorded in Table 5.

39

8The less than 100% compensation for inflation was introduced on the

grounds that nominal wages should not be adjusted in response to
external shocks.

The lack

of full indexation has

led to

continuing

attempts by labor to restore real wages in mid—contract, and thus to
increased

labor

strife. Some

Israeli economists now argue that wage

indexation should be complete, frequent, and put in place as soon as
possible following each change in prices——on the grounds both that
this

would ininiinize labor trouble and

that it would

help the

disinflation process.

10The Bank of Israel data differ in several respects from those of the

are difficult to reconcile, in part because Bank data are typically

would be for the U.S. There were nonetheless until 1981—2 rJor

25These curves embody the assumption of asset market clearing, since
the functions q( ) and h( ),

(13) and (14), are used to substitute for

q and e/p wherever they appear in (6) and (7).
26

These ambiguities arise only because

an increase in output is

assumed to increase q, thereby increasing demand both through a wealth
effect

and by raising investment. Ibwever, as noted in the discussion

of Figure 4, this effect is assumed to be snall.
27 The graphical analysis raisen the possibility that the su'pl:T side
exchange rate effect could lead to a fall in output when the money

stock rises. This possibility can be ruled out by noting that if the
price level were to rise in the same proportion as the money stock,

with output at its original level, the assets markets would be in
equilibrium, the demand

for goods would be at its original level, but

supply would exceed demand.
28

In a more detailed model, an l money stock increase could result

from a change in reserve requirements that would not necessarily
affect the government budget.

42

29Such a variable would perform for foreign currency linked

securities

a role almost identical to that of q for capital: the value of the
stock of such assets (the left hand side of the market clearing
equation) would
