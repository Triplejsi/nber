The Scots may be Brave but They are Neither Healthy Nor Happy

ABSTRACT
On almost all measures of physical health, Scots fare worse than residents of any other region of the
UK and often worse than the rest of Europe. Deaths from chronic liver disease and lung cancer are
particularly prevalent in Scotland. The self-assessed wellbeing of Scots is lower than that of the
English or Welsh, even after taking into account any differences in characteristics. Scots also suffer
from higher levels of self-assessed depression or phobia, accidental death and suicide than those in
other parts of Great Britain. This result is particularly driven by outcomes in Strathclyde and is
consistent with the high scores for other measures of social deprivation in this area. On average,
indicators of social capital in Scotland are no worse than in England or Wales. Detailed analysis
within Scotland, however, shows that social capital indicators for the Strathclyde area are relatively
low. We argue that these problems seem unlikely to be fixed by indirect policies aimed at raising
economic growth.

SCOTLAND THE BRAVE
Hark when the night is fallin, hear, hear the pipes a'callin
Loudly and proudly callin' down thru the glen
There where the hills are sleepin', now feel the blood aleapin'
High as the spirits of the old highland men!
Towering in gallant fame,
Scotland the mountain hame!
High may your proud standards gloriously wave!
Land of the high endeavour, land of the shining river,
Land of my heart, forever, Scotland the brave!1
1. Introduction
The principal policy objective of the Scottish Executive is to increase Scotland’s rate of
economic growth.2 Yet, as Oswald (1997), points out “economic performance is not intrinsically
interesting. No-one is concerned in a genuine sense about the level of gross national product last
year or about next year’s exchange rate.”

The proposition that measures of economic

performance are not valued in themselves is very plausible. It is therefore reasonable to ask why
economic growth is elevated above all other policy objectives by the Scottish Executive.
Economists’ usual response is that growth increases gross national income which in turn
leads to increases in “wellbeing”, “welfare” or “life satisfaction” among the population. Growth
is therefore a means to an end. It permits higher levels of consumption which in turn leads to
higher levels of wellbeing among the population. Put simply, more growth leads to more haggis
(or, better still, more rounds of golf) being consumed, which in turn makes people feel more
satisfied with life.

This policy was agreed in May 2003 by the Liberal-Democrat/Labour coalition. At this time, it was believed that
Scotland’s growth rate lagged well behind that of the UK as a whole. But data revisions published in 2004 show that
differences in growth rates between Scotland and the rest of the UK over the last four decades have been negligible.

Until recently, economists have tended not to question the link from measures of
economic performance to individual wellbeing or happiness. But with the advent of surveys
which question individuals about their views of “life satisfaction” or “happiness”, a substantial
literature on these links has built up. There is even a world database on happiness.3 For a
summary of this literature, see Blanchflower and Oswald (2004a, 2004b). The questions asked
in the Eurobarometer survey are fairly typical. In a majority of the Eurobarometer surveys
respondents have been asked the question: On the whole, are you very satisfied, fairly satisfied,
not very satisfied, or not at all satisfied with the life you lead?

For the years 1975-1986

respondents were also asked about their happiness – Taking all things together how would you
say things are these days, would you say you’re very happy, fairly happy or not too happy these
days? Even though such questions have been asked for a considerable time in Scotland, to our
knowledge there has been no attempt to analyze such data. This paper is the first to examine
these data for Scotland in detail.
Most of the recent literature has focused on the analysis of subjective measures of
wellbeing. There is however, a wealth of objective indicators of wellbeing in Scotland other than
those that are commonly rehearsed in the economics literature. These relate to issues such as
health, crime and lifestyle. For example, if the self-assessed wellbeing data are meaningful, one
might expect to see correlations between these measures and objective measures of mental
health, at least at an aggregate level, and this is what we find. There is also a growing literature
on social capital and its impact on growth and wellbeing.
As well as making a broad assessment of its relation to a variety of socio-economic
indicators, this paper extends the previous literature on wellbeing by including information on
3

individuals’ assessments of their own mental health. It also discusses an extreme manifestation
of mental ill-health – suicide. It also extends research on the association between individual
wellbeing and social capital. The geographical context for these developments is Scotland.
Thus we report how Scotland fares in relation to standard indicators such as the labour
force participation rate, employment and unemployment rates, income inequality, poverty, the
performance of its schools as well as to indicators of health and wellbeing. Our conclusions are
generally pessimistic. The self-assessed wellbeing of Scots is lower than that of the English or
Welsh, even after taking into account the differences in the characteristics of the Scots, Irish and
Welsh. Scots also suffer from higher levels of self-assessed depression or phobia, accidental
death and suicide than those in other parts of Great Britain. This result is particularly driven by
outcomes in Strathclyde4 and is consistent with the high scores for other measures of social
deprivation in this area.
Crime is lower in Scotland than in the UK as a whole although it does have a higher
homicide rate. The contrast between Scotland and the UK as a whole is also much greater on
these health and wellbeing measures than it is on measures of poverty or income inequality.
Real household incomes in Scotland have risen dramatically over the last decade or so, even for
those at the lowest quintile of the income distribution. Scotland also scores relatively well on
social capital compared with the rest of Great Britain. Scotland’s main problems are its low
levels of health and wellbeing.
Arthur Herman (2001) argues in his book How the Scots Invented the Modern World that
at the turn of the twentieth century
“Scotland had finally arrived – at least as far as Great Britain was concerned.
Glasgow was now the industrial workshop of the empire…Its iron and steel
4

This is the area of western Scotland centered round Glasgow, Scotland’s largest population centre.

foundries and shipbuilding yards turned out close to one third of the nation’s total
output in each industry. It supplied locomotives and boxcars to Canada, South
America and the rest of Europe as well as India and Asia Shipbuilding firms
along the Clyde…turned out one fifth of the world’s total shipping tonnage ”
(2001, p.347-348).
Adam Smith fathered Economics. James Watt invented the steam engine, John Boyd Dunlop the
bicycle, and Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, while George Stephenson built the first
modern railway. Sir Walter Scott, Robert Louis Stephenson and Arthur Conan Doyle, to name
but a few, had written great literature. In the years before the First World War the Scots had
dominated British politics – from 1894 to the outbreak of WW1 three of the five prime ministers
were Scottish (Rosebery, Balfour and Campbell-Bannerman) and Asquith was married to a
Scotswoman and sat for a Scottish constituency for his thirty-five year career.
This was all to change.
“As the nineteenth century waned, the intellectual capital of the Scottish
Enlightenment waned with it. …Scotland’s days as the generator of Europe’s
most innovative ideas were over. However, she had done her work: the future
direction of the modern world which Scotland had done so much to chart and
establish, was now set. What still hung in the balance was the fate of Scotland
itself.” Herman (2001, p.347)
Herman notes that even at the peak of Scotland’s industrial and intellectual power poverty and
ill-health remained a major problem. Not much has changed in a hundred years. At the start of
the twentieth century infant mortality was high and disease and malnutrition was rampant
particularly in Scotland’s major cities. During the twentieth century Strathclyde experienced
significant industrial decline due to the almost complete demise of heavy manufacturing
including steel-making, engineering, shipbuilding and coal mining.

Housing conditions

continued to be generally poor, leaving a legacy of ill-health. Local authority policies aimed at
improving housing conditions resulted in the creation of large “peripheral estates” of socially
rented housing, particularly around Glasgow. In time these estates themselves became focal

points for unemployment, ill-health and disability. The latest data available at the time of
writing for September 2005, when the unemployment rate in the UK was 4.7%, the
unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.4% and 7.8% in Glasgow City.5
We begin by reviewing some relevant literature. We then look at some descriptive
statistics which compare how Scotland compares with other areas in respect of subjective
wellbeing and in relation to objective health and welfare-related measures. We estimate some
econometric models to explain these phenomena in the penultimate section, while the final
section draws together some policy lessons from what has gone before.
2. Literature Review
The simplest way to measure wellbeing is to ask individuals how they feel about their
lives. In the literature on subjective wellbeing, psychologists have traditionally preferred lifesatisfaction questions to most others. It is believed that (compared to questions about happiness
levels, for example) such questions translate more readily across languages and cultures.
Introductions to the psychology literature on the interpretation of wellbeing data are contained in
Campbell (1981) and Argyle (1987).

An overview paper written from the economist’s

perspective is Oswald (1997), while Easterlin (1974) made an early influential contribution.
A number of objections have been raised to the use of data on self-reported wellbeing.
One is that such data are unreliable and of no value in discussions of economic welfare. Another
is that they are accurate and reliable guides to comparisons between societies at a single point in
time, but that comparisons through time are invalid because individuals’ understanding of the
language describing happiness or wellbeing changes and evolves. Of course, this assumes that
comparisons across cultures are also meaningful, and there are reasons to be cautious about this –
5

for example, the Japanese may view very positive responses to life satisfaction questions as
impolite.
However, studies which analyze individual’s reports about their level of life satisfaction
have found a number of consistent results – both through time and across countries. These
include:
a) For affluent Western economies, there is a rather weak link between self-reported wellbeing
and income. Income does buy some happiness but much less than most economists would
probably have expected – non-money items such as marriage, sex and employment provide a lot
of happiness (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004b). Conversely, divorce and unemployment bring
much unhappiness (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004a).
b) Employment is a key determinant of self-reported wellbeing. The self-employed report higher
levels of wellbeing than the employed and in turn than the unemployed (Blanchflower, 2004).
Although not previously discussed in the literature, we are also able to show here that the
inactive – those of working age who have lost contact with the labour market - also report lower
levels of wellbeing than the employed. This is an important result for our final policy discussion,
bearing in mind that inactivity has grown rapidly in recent years. Bell and Jack (2002) point out
that the number of households where no adult was active in the labour market increased from
241 thousand to 364 thousand between 1991 and 2001. In Strathclyde in 2001, 27 per cent of
households had no adult active in the labour market, while in the Rest of Scotland the proportion
of households with no active adult was only 18 per cent.
c) Relative things matter. Individuals compare themselves to others. In happiness equations
both income and relative income have effects. Individuals appear to get happier the closer their
incomes come to that of rich people around them. There is also some evidence that people do

not want to be far above the poorest people (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004a). Paterson (2002)
argues that social attitude surveys suggest that Scots’ identity is closely linked to notions of
egalitarianism and equity. Alesina et al (2004) find evidence that inequality adversely affects the
happiness of the European poor. Luttmer (2005) finds for the United States that controlling for
an individual’s own income, higher earnings of neighbors are associated with lower levels of
self-reported happiness.
The literature on the relationship between economic wellbeing and mental ill-health is
less developed. This is not surprising since a fundamental tenet of conventional economic
analysis is that consumers behave rationally.

Thus, while some studies have attempted to

measure the economic costs of mental illness, very few have considered individual
characteristics, including economic characteristics, which are associated with self-reported
mental ill-health. An exception is Gardner and Oswald (2003), who show that mental wellbeing
has a “U” shaped relationship with education. Those with degrees or relatively low levels of
education experience higher rates of mental stress than those with intermediate qualifications.
However, for those with similar incomes and economic status, more education is associated with
less stress.
Some may query the subjectivity inherent in analyzing self-reported mental stress data,
again because respondents may interpret such questions differently through space and time.
However, one objectively measurable manifestation of extreme mental ill-health is suicide. The
classic paper on the economic interpretation of the increase in youth suicide is Cutler, Glaeser
and Norberg (2001). Suicide rates in the US among those aged 15-24 have tripled in the last
fifty years. In the past, suicide rates increased with age, but between 1950 and 1990, suicide
rates among the elderly in the US fell by 30 per cent.

In the US, youth suicide has not been centered on deprived inner cities although social
stresses and drugs appear to be influential. Social interactions are important: teenagers are more
likely to attempt suicide if they know someone else who has attempted suicide. The most
important aggregate variable explaining the increase in youth suicide is the increase in the
numbers of young men staying at home with a divorced parent.

Divorce rates are better

predictors of suicide rates than is the share of children staying in single parent families or with
step-parents. When modeling the factors which might explain unsuccessful suicide attempts
using micro-data, Cutler et al find that poor interaction with parents and activities such as drugtaking, sex and violence significantly increase the risk that a young person will attempt to
commit suicide (unsuccessfully). But establishing the direction of causation among activities is
problematic.
Links between health and economic outcomes are also unclear. Poverty and inequality
have long been associated with relatively poor health outcomes (Kawachi et al 1999). However,
recent evidence from Deaton and Paxton (2003) has cast doubt on these arguments, at least as far
as recent US and British history is concerned. Deaton and Paxson use data on age-specific
mortality in Britain and the United States from 1950. Of the decline in these mortality rates, they
argue that
“neither trends in income nor in income inequality provide plausible explanations.
Britain and the US had different patterns of income growth but similar patterns of
mortality decline. Patterns of income inequality were similar in both countries, but adult
and elderly mortality rates declined most rapidly during the period when inequality
increased.”
Instead they suggest that improvements in mortality have largely been driven by technical
improvements in treatment. This argument suggests that any assumptions that increased

incomes and/or reduced inequality will have a direct impact on health outcomes are perhaps
misplaced.
We conclude this section with a discussion of social capital and its relationship to
wellbeing and health. Putnam (1993) defines social capital as “features of social organizations,
such as trust, norms and networks that can improve the efficiency of society by facilitating
coordinated actions”. He argues that it comprises the "networks, norms, and trust that enable
participants to act together more effectively to pursue shared objectives" (Baron et al. 2000).
Measures of social capital tend to focus measures of community organisation, engagements in
public affairs, community volunteerism, informal sociability and trust. There is general
agreement that higher social capital is associated with lower crime rates and better health.
Education is positively related with social capital (Putnam 2000). Helliwell (2003) argues that
individual wellbeing is positively associated with both individual and societal indicators of social
capital. Perhaps poor health, addictive behaviours and high levels of violent crime are associated
with low levels of social capital. Parkes and Kearns (2004), using the Scottish Household
Survey, argue that poor health outcomes are caused by perceptions of adverse neighbourhood
characteristics such as unfriendly or unhelpful neighbours and lack of community involvement.
While causality is more difficult to assign than they suggest, there is value in investigating, as we
shall subsequently, whether social capital indicators align with those from the labour market and
with data on mental and physical health.
3. Descriptive Statistics
We continue our investigation by establishing some basic social and economic facts
about Scotland. Table 1 includes a series of key comparisons between Scotland and the United
Kingdom as a whole. Scotland’s position at the start of the twenty first century relative to the

rest of the UK is not very different than that described by Herman a hundred years earlier at the
start of the twentieth century. In general Scotland ranks behind most of the rest of the United
Kingdom on wages, incomes and unemployment and, on many measures of health and
wellbeing, below both Wales and Northern Ireland. The gap between Scotland’s unemployment
rate and that of the UK as a whole appears to have widened over the last decade. In 1994 the
unemployment rate in Scotland of those aged 16 and over was 9.9% and in 2004 was 5.9%
(Scottish Economic Statistics, 2004, Table 4.2) compared with rates for the UK as a whole of
9.8% and 4.8% in 1994 and 2004 respectively (Annual Abstract of Statistics, 2005, Table 7.1).
There are some high points: Scottish schools appear to be of high quality, based on the
proportion that obtain passes at the GCSE level and overall crime rates are lower than in the rest
of the UK. Economic activity and employment rates are about the same as in the rest of the UK.
However, the proportion of those individuals who are out of the labour force (OLF) reporting
that the reason is because of long-term sickness or disability is particularly high in Scotland,
whether such individuals wanted a job or not. Moreover, the proportion saying they wanted a
job but had not looked for work in the last four weeks – the truly discouraged – was especially
high in Scotland (31.7%) than in Wales (21.5%), Northern Ireland 17.6% or England 24.0%.
(Source: Labour Force Survey 2004).
The percentage of households earning under £150 per week in the UK is only slightly
lower than it is in Scotland (18% and 21% respectively).

There are also relatively small

differences in the proportion of households classified into bottom income quintile before and
after housing costs are included. The proportion of taxpayers with annual taxable incomes less
than £5000 is the same in Scotland as in the UK (2.7%) although the proportion earning over
£30,000 is lower in Scotland (13.9% and 11.2% respectively). There is also evidence that real

incomes in Scotland have increased – “overall median income in Scotland has risen by 3.3% per
annum in real terms since 1996/7, growth has been highest for those in households in the second
quintile of the income distribution (4.2% per annum)” (Scottish Economic Statistics, 2004,
p.157). This group is likely to include households with low income earners, who will mostly
have benefited from income-related benefits such as tax credits.

In 2003, 22 percent of

households in Scotland lived in low-income households – defined as incomes below 60% of the
Great Britain median - down from 24 per cent in 1996/7.
Overall 17% of the working age population in Scotland, (29% in Glasgow), at February
2004 were in receipt of one or more state benefits.

Moreover, 11% of the working age

population in Scotland reported being sick and disabled compared with 18% in Glasgow City
(Scottish Economic Statistics, 2004, Table 5.3). The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation
(2004) shows that deprivation is highly concentrated in Strathclyde and Glasgow. The index
measures deprivation in terms of health, income, education, labour market experience, housing
and access to facilities and telecommunications. Deprivation scores are formed for each of 6500
areas. Of the 500 areas with the highest deprivation scores, 423 are in Strathclyde and 282 of
these lie within Glasgow. By contrast, Scotland'
s other major city, Edinburgh, has only 36 areas
within the 500 highest deprivation scores.6 Now we consider some of these socio-economic
indicators in greater depth.
Crime against households in Scotland is low compared with the rest of the UK (Table 2).
Data from the relevant British and Scottish Crime Surveys show that, although burglaries are
relatively high in Scotland compared to Wales and Northern Ireland, both vandalism and vehicle
thefts are sharply lower in Scotland than elsewhere. As a result, the rate of offences against
6

households in Scotland, at 2,374 per 10,000 households, is 44 per cent lower than in England and
Wales. Table 2 provides further information on the crime rate. Although it has the lowest
overall crime rate of 2,374 per 10,000 households, Scotland has a very high prison population.
Individuals are slightly more likely to be put in jail in Scotland than in the rest of the UK. There
were 6.4 thousand individuals locked up in Scotland in 2002 out of a total of 66 thousand in the
UK as a whole.
Although the Scottish population comprises only 8.6 per cent of the UK population
(Table 1), the number of prisoners in Scottish jails is 9.6 per cent of the UK total. This is partly
because crimes of violence, including murder, are more common in Scotland.

The male

homicide rate in Scotland is 70 per cent above that in England and Wales. Female murder rates
differ little across Great Britain. Homicide using sharp instruments (knives) and hitting or
kicking by males known to the victim are particularly prevalent. (Scottish Executive 1999a).
Again, the distribution within Scotland is instructive. Recorded crime data for 2003 show that
for many crimes, rates of offending in Strathclyde and the Rest of Scotland are quite similar.
These include burglary, motor offences and crimes of dishonesty. But the violent crime rate in
Strathclyde is twice that of the rest of Scotland.7
There is a vast array of statistics showing that Scots are relatively unhealthy. Recent
investigations have shown that Scots have higher rates of obesity8 and asthma9 than in other parts

See Chin and Rona (2001).

See Masoli et al (2004) in a report presented by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) at the World Asthma
meeting in Bangkok, Thailand on February 16th 2004 show that more than a third of 13-14 year olds in Scotland had
suffered symptoms of the disease in the last year compared with 30% in England and 34% in Wales. Overall more
than 18% of all Scots experience symptoms compared with 17.0% in Wales, 15.3% in England. Switzerland has a
rate of 2.3% and Greece 1.9%. The UK has twice as many adults with some degree of asthma (25%) as France
(triple the Italian figure). UK children are up to three times more likely to suffer from asthma than children in

of the UK and indeed Europe. Diabetes in Scotland is 24 per 100,000 per year in the under 15
year old population and is one of the highest incidence areas in the world. Scottish men and
women have among the highest premature mortality rates from coronary heart disease and one of
the highest rates of stroke in the Western World. It is estimated that half a million Scots have
coronary heart disease, of which 180,000 require treatment.
Table 3 reports the numbers of deaths, by cause, in England and Wales and separately for
Scotland in 2003 along with the proportion of British deaths accounted for by Scottish residents.
Overall Scotland accounts for 8.74% of the population but 9.8% of all deaths. The table indicates
that Scottish death rates are particularly high for reasons of alcohol abuse, drug dependency and
to a lesser degree for lung cancer and chronic liver disease. Deaths due to suicide and intentional
self-harm, accidental falls and homicide are also particularly prevalent in Scotland. Indeed, the
incidence of chronic liver disease is more than double the incidence found in the United States
while deaths from lung cancer were over 40 per cent higher in Scotland.10
More than half of middle-aged Scots are overweight. The middle-aged Scot also has a
blood pressure which rates as one of the highest in the Western World. The Scottish Executive
acknowledges that the Scottish diet is, next to smoking, the most significant reason for Scotland'
s
poor health record - premature death is twice as likely in Scotland as in many western countries
(Scottish Office 1999b).

France, Germany or Italy. The report suggests that more than 1200 people died of asthma in Scotland between 1990
and 1999 of which 43% were under the age of 65.
10

Source: US Statistical Abstract of the United States, 2005, Table 103 shows that the death rate by ‘chronic liver
disease and cirrhosis’ in the United States in 2002 was 9.3 per 100000 population compared with 23.1 in Scotland in
2003. The figures for deaths from ‘malignant neoplasms of trachea, bronchus and lung’ were 54.9 and 77.0 per
100,000 population respectively.

Table 4 provides information for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland on
mortality, fertility and birth rates plus self-reported health, smoking and alcohol consumption.
The main findings are as follows.
1) Infant mortality rates and perinatal mortality rates are a little higher in Scotland than for the
UK as a whole.
2) Overall mortality rates are particularly high in Scotland for cerebro-vascular disease,
bronchitis and cancer.
3) Cancer rates in Scotland are relatively high for both men and women but are the same as the
rest of the UK for breast and cervical cancer.
4) The population in Scotland is declining. The UK population has increased 5.9% since 1971
compared with a decline of 3.5% in Scotland (Regional Trends, 2004, Table 3.1).
5) Suicide rates are high in Scotland.
6) Heavy cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption are particularly prevalent in Scotland.
7) The proportion of the population who report that their health is good is lower in Scotland for
men, for all age groups, than it is in England. In the case of women the reverse is true for those
over 44 years of age.
Although death rates from heart disease and, to a lesser extent, cancer have been falling
in recent years, the incidence of these diseases is well above both UK and European averages.
The immediate causes of poor health and high mortality rates may be well understood, but the
underlying causes are much less clear. It was thought that Scotland’s excess death rate was
associated with high levels of deprivation, but recent evidence (Public Health Institute for
Scotland 2001) shows that while deprived areas in Strathclyde have the highest rates of excess
deaths in the UK, all other parts of Scotland experience death rates above the English and Welsh

median during the 1990s. For example death rates per 1000 population in the UK in 2002 were
10.2%; they were 13.1% in South Ayrshire; 13.5% in the Western Isles and 12.0% in the Scottish
Borders (Regional Trends, 2004 Table 16.2). No clear cut causal explanation of the economic,
social and psychological factors that underlie this outcome has been forthcoming.
Scotland also has high accident rates from road accidents, from falls and from assaults.
For males according to the General Register Office Scotland and the Office of National Statistics
deaths by falls in 2002 for males in Scotland were 10% (16%) compared with 4% (4%) for
England and Wales and 4% (2%) for Europe.11 In the case of deaths by assault the figures for
males in Scotland were 4% (1%) compared with 1% (1%) for England and Wales as well as for
Europe. Each of these causes is probably influenced by excessive use of alcohol in Scotland
which we document below.
Figure 1 shows that the suicide rate in Scotland is significantly higher than that of other
English speaking countries including the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland and
higher than the Scandinavian countries, with the exception of Finland. However, it is lower than
many of the transition economies of Eastern Europe, which have among the highest suicide rates
in the world. Figure 2 reports the change in the rate of deaths by both ‘intentional self-harm’ and
‘undetermined cause’ in Scotland, 1980-2004. It is clear that there has been a rise in the
incidence over time for men but not for women. Though the absolute rates of suicide for women
are lower, there is a sevenfold differential in their suicide rates between deprived and affluent
areas. Because deprivation is concentrated in Strathclyde, this suggests higher suicide rates in
this part of Scotland. In 2003, male suicide rates in Strathclyde were 9 per cent higher than in
Scotland as a whole. In Glasgow the male rate was 40 per cent higher, while that for females was
11

Figures in parentheses are for females.

53 per cent higher than that in Scotland as a whole. As can be seen from Table 5, there is also a
high incidence of suicides in the more rural areas of Scotland including the Highlands, Shetland
and the Western Isles.12
Suicide rates are especially high for men ages 35-44 which in Scotland in 2004 were 47.2
per 100,000 population. Cutler et al (2001) suggest that the variability of individual welfare has
increased through time. This may be the result of family breakdown, with children having less
access to family relations as a “buffer” to deal with emotional upheavals. More variability
implies more individuals with very low perceptions of their own wellbeing and consequently
more predisposition to attempt suicide. At the 2001 Census, 11.3 per cent of the adult population
of Glasgow were divorced or separated compared with 8.9 per cent in Strathclyde and 8.3 per
cent in Scotland as a whole.
Overindulgence in alcohol and smoking are prevalent in Scotland. Table 4 shows that
28% of men in Scotland drank more than 8 units in the previous week compared with 21% in
England and 20% in Wales. Females in Scotland also reported drinking slightly more than those
in the rest of the UK, but the differences were smaller than was the case for males. In a study of
European drinking patterns and suicide rates, Ramstedt, (2002) argues that there is a relationship
between alcohol consumption and suicide rates which is strongest in those countries with
traditionally low levels of alcohol consumption. However, the UK as a whole is classed as
having medium consumption levels. Links between suicide and alcohol consumption are less
clear for countries in this consumption category.
Table 4 also shows that a higher proportion of both men and women in Scotland are
heavy smokers – that is they smoke more than 20 cigarettes a day. In England in 1998 10% of
12

girls ages 11-15 and 17% of boys of these ages smoked. In Scotland 14% of girls ages 12-15 and
19% of boys smoked (Drever et al, 2000). According to the 2003/2004 Scottish Household
Survey 27% of adult Scots smoked with the highest rate in Glasgow City (33%) and the lowest
in East Dunbartonshire (18%).13 This likely explains the very high prevalence of lung cancer
among the causes of death.
There is also evidence from Table 3 that Scotland accounts for a considerably higher
proportion of deaths from drug dependence and non-dependent abuse of drugs than is true in the
rest of Great Britain. Scotland’s share of deaths by this cause has shown a strong increase since
1997-8. According to the Scottish Crime Surveys, however, there has been some decline in the
use of drugs in Scotland.14 It appears that drug misuse, particularly among the younger age
groups, increased in the mid 1990s but fell at the end of the 1990s. Looking at use in the last
year (the most reliable indicator of change), there was a significant decrease in respondents
reporting the use of any drug from 9% to 6.6%. There was also a significant decrease in the
proportion of respondents who had ‘ever’ used drugs, from 22.5% to 19.2%.
These indicators together paint a fairly depressing picture of the overall health of the
Scottish population. On almost all measures of physical health, Scots fare worse than residents
of any other region of the UK and often worse than the rest of Europe. High suicide rates are
also indicative of poor states of mental health. Scottish men in particular are less likely to report
that their health is good than is true in the rest of the UK. Many of the adverse health outcomes
are avoidable in the sense that they are the result of lifestyle choices made by Scots. These
inevitably reflect societal and cultural pressures – but they also depend on the economic

environment. The labour market is key to this interaction and we now consider how labour
market experiences differ between Scotland and other parts of the UK.
4. Econometric Analysis
The Labour Market
To see how Scots fare in the United Kingdom labour market we conducted an
econometric analysis using data from the quarterly Labour Force Surveys for the period January
1992-May 2005. To do this we merged together 39 separate quarterly surveys. We include
every quarterly survey since 1995 and exclude spring and fall quarters in 1993-1995 only to be
consistent with later analysis on depression which is only asked in these quarters. Nothing of
importance hinges on these sample exclusions. We thus have a large, recent dataset with
approximately four million observations in which all of the questions in which we were
interested were asked in a consistent fashion.
We first restricted our analysis to individuals of working age between the ages of 16 and
64. We conducted separate econometric analyses where we examined the rankings of Strathclyde
and the Rest of Scotland compared with the other regions in the UK: we report separate results
also for Wales, Northern Ireland, Inner London, Outer London and the Rest of England with the
Rest of the South East as the excluded category. First, we model the probability of an individual
being unemployed (relative to being employed or self-employed) followed by the probability of
an individual reporting being ‘inactive due to long term sickness or disability’ compared with
everyone else in our sample. Table 6 models the probability of an individual in the labor force
being unemployed15 and now use a relatively recent sample from March 1997 to May 2005 of
just over two million individuals.

excluded (OLF); the dependent variable is set to one if the individual is unemployed and zero if
working as an employee or as self-employed. Robust standard errors are used. The equations
control for age, gender, race, schooling, month of interview, an annual time trend and region of
residence. The probability of an individual being unemployed, holding constant this host of
personal characteristics, is higher in Strathclyde than in any other region of the country and
especially so for men. The Rest of Scotland fares a little better. Unemployment is also high for
men living in Inner London. Unemployment trends down in Scotland and Strathclyde.
The next analysis models those who are inactive due to ‘long-term sickness or disability’
and tells a further depressing tale. Table 7, which has a sample size of nearly 3.5 million as it
includes the employed, the unemployed and those out of the labour force; the dependent variable
is set to one if the individual is OLF due to '
sickness or disability'and zero if employed,
unemployed or OLF for other reasons, with robust standard errors. The full time-run of data are
used from January 1992 through May 2005 in column 1 and for the period 1992-February 1997
in column 2 and for the period March 1997 through May 2005 in column 3.16 There is evidence
in column 1 that a higher proportion of individuals in Strathclyde have withdrawn from the
labour force for reasons of sickness or disability. The coefficient on the Strathclyde dummy of
.07 is large, given that it has an overall unweighted mean in the data of .06. There is evidence
also that the gap is widening over time as the coefficient grew from .065 in the earlier period to
.077 in the second. The coefficient is also increasing in the Rest of Scotland, which has a higher
proportion of individuals who have withdrawn from the labour force because of sickness than is
found in the Rest of England, Outer London and the Rest of the South East. In contrast to the
evidence on unemployment presented above, the proportion of individuals reporting that they are

The choice of time periods is designed to be consistent with the analysis of depression in the next table where
there was a change in the health question from March 1997. Nothing crucial hinges on this choice of date.

inactive due to long-term sickness is rising over time. Interestingly despite the fact that there has
been an overall rise in the incidence of reporting being inactive due to sickness the trend is
downward in Scotland and Strathclyde, for which there is no obvious explanation.
Many of the long-term disabled are likely to be discouraged workers who have failed to
escape unemployment and then have moved onto different types of social security benefits.
Scotland accounts for 8.7 per cent of the GB population, but 11.7 per cent of incapacity benefit
claimants, 11 per cent of disability living allowance claimants and 10.5 per cent of income
support claimants in May 2005. Thus the benefits data are consistent with the weakness of the
labour market revealed by the econometric analysis of unemployment and long-term sickness or
disability.
The local authority data also reveal the same consistency between benefit claims and
labour market status. Strathclyde accounts for 43 per cent of the Scottish population, but 52 per
cent of the unemployment, while Glasgow, which accounts for 11 per cent of the population had
17.5 per cent of Scotland’s unemployed in May 2005. The rate of claims for disability living
allowance (DLA) in Strathclyde is 32 per cent above that for Scotland as a whole, while the rate
in Glasgow it is 202 per cent higher. DLA claims increased by 12 per cent between 2002 and
2005 both in the UK as a whole and in Scotland.
Thus our relatively simple comparisons of labour market and social security benefit
statistics and the more robust econometric results from large samples drawn from the Labour
Force Survey reveal a weakness in the Scottish labour market that is particularly focused on the
Strathclyde area in general and Glasgow in particular. These findings are reasonably well known.
We now attempt to tie this analysis both to considerations of mental health and to life satisfaction
and happiness.

Mental illness
In the Labour Force Surveys a series of questions have been asked since 1992 about an
individual’s health and the extent to which any health problems limit that individual’s ability to
work, to get about and generally how their daily lives are affected. The questions have been
asked in each quarter from Spring 1992 to Winter 1992, Summer and Winter quarters only from
Summer 1993 to Winter 1995 and then each quarter from Spring 1996 to Winter 96.17 The
respondents are asked whether they have health problems or disabilities which ‘limit the kind of
paid work they can do’. Respondents are not asked about the extent of the limitation. Each
quarter to Winter 96 respondents reported that they had '
depression, bad nerves'and reported up
to three '
health problems which affect you the most'
. From Winter 1996 on respondents reported
on their most important health problem with the classification now changed to '
depression, bad
nerves or anxiety'
. The focus and number of questions on health and disability further changed
in Spring 1997 to reflect the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. In particular,
the new questions are concerned with all health problems, whilst until spring 97 the emphasis
had been on problems which affect respondent’s work. Since that time there has been a dramatic
increase in a number of the health problems reported, including in the incidence of ‘depression,
bad nerves or anxiety’. Its (unweighted) incidence has nearly doubled since 1998, as is shown in
Table 8.
More disturbing, however, is the high incidence of self-reported depression in
Strathclyde, which was over 3% using the latest estimates for mid-2005. Table 9 shows the
results of an analysis which estimates the probability that an individual reports being depressed,

17

the Fall quarter is September, October and November and the Winter quarter December and January and February of
the following year.

given their personal characteristics. It shows that the incidence in Strathclyde is high even after
controlling for individual characteristics. For the period before February 1997 the dependent
variable is set to one if the respondent reported that they were depressed on any one of the three
health variables. After February 1997, the dependent variable uses the response to the single
health variable covering the “most important illness”. The first column is for the whole period
1992-2005 while the second column is for the period up to February 1997 using the first
definition of the health variable where three possible options are available and the response
relates to a condition limiting their ability to work. Column three uses the single variable where
respondents reported the single most important health problem; column 4 is for Scotland and
column 5 for Strathclyde only. In all five equations there is an upward time trend (1992=1 and
so on) which is especially large in Strathclyde (.0018 compared with .0011 for the UK), despite
the fact that the proportion of individuals reporting being inactive due to disability and sickness
in Table 6. Even after allowing for differences in age, race, gender, month of interview and level
of education, those living in Strathclyde are significantly more likely to report depression, bad
nerves and anxiety than is the case in any other area in the UK and the gap is rising over time
which is a cause for concern.
Taken together, this evidence suggests a picture of ill health – both physical and mental –
in Scotland in general and in Strathclyde in particular. The evidence comes from objectively
measured health outcomes – such as mortality data - and from self-reported health measures. We
have also seen that labour market outcomes – such as inactivity and unemployment are linked to
health status. Attributing the direction of causation is extremely difficult with such relationships.
This is not an area that we investigate here. However, one point we would wish to make is that a
number of the health conditions from which Scots particularly suffer are associated with lifestyle

choices including drug-taking, alcohol consumption and diet. Such choices are properly of
interest to economists as well as to other professional groups. An economists’ explanation of
why they occur would centre around two possibilities. The first is that perhaps Scots are poorly
informed about the future implications of the choices they make. This argument is difficult to
support since there is no obvious reasons why information on the implications of lifestyle
choices should be any different in Scotland from the rest if the UK. The second reason is that
Scots may discount the future more than people in other parts of the UK. That is, their choices
are more dominated by short-term than long-term considerations. If this were the case, then
short-run choices that might lead to long-term adverse health consequences might seem rational.
Unfortunately, economics is not very adept at explaining why individual discount rates vary.
There is an extensive literature on the potential effects of differences in discount rates, but little
to explain why they might arise. A plausible proposition is that high discount rates are linked to
low self-esteem, which in turn has been linked to other potentially adverse behaviours such as
smoking, drinking, drug-taking and obesity.

This would be consistent with the objective

evidence which we have collected, particularly in relation to Strathclyde. Third, there is a legacy
of the past that has been very difficult to overcome. Herman (2001) noted that poverty and
disease existed in and around Glasgow at the beginning of the twentieth century and it appears
that this is also true at the start of the twenty first century, although its manifestation in the form
of lung cancer, heart disease and poor mental health is seemingly different. We see few signs
that there will be a marked improvement any time soon.
Social Capital
Another hypothesis that we have sought to test is that the adverse indicators for Scotland
and Strathclyde are due to low levels of social capital. For this test we used the social capital data

collected with the 2000-01 General Household Survey which highlights five dimensions of social
capital: these comprise civic engagement, neighbourliness and reciprocity, social networks,
social support and views about the local area.18 These are intended to capture individuals’ views
of: the neighbourliness of their area; their views of local social facilities; whether they feel that
they have an adequate network of friends; whether they feel that they have an adequate network
of family and whether they are “civically engaged”. There were 8200 observations in Great
Britain as a whole, 730 of which were in Scotland. No subdivisions within Scotland were
available. We tested whether there is a significant “Scotland effect” associated with these six
summary measures of social capital.
Table 10 shows the value of the Scotland dummy (with England as the base case) for our
five index measures of social capital. Some of the dependent variables are continuous while
others are dichotomous. We therefore use a mixture of OLS and probit estimators. In each
equation we include age, gender and marital status as controls. Both on neighbourliness and on
views of local facilities, the Scotland dummy is not statistically significant, implying no
difference between Scotland and England in these categories. But Scots tend to have better
friendship and family networks. This is implied by the significance of the dummy variables for
the relevant equations. Finally, using the variable that ONS argue is most closely aligned with
Putnam’s concept of social capital, namely “lack of social engagement”, there is again no
statistically significant difference between Scotland and England. These findings suggest that
social capital levels in Scotland are certainly no lower than in the rest of Great Britain. Thus, a
low level of social capital is not a strong contender as an explanation of low levels of well-being
in Scotland as a whole.
18

For details see Coulthard, Walker and Morgan (2002)

There were two findings. First, there were no significant differences between Scotland,
England and Wales in perceptions of neighborliness, local problems or local facilities. Second,
Wales and Scotland had substantially higher scores than England on closeness to friends and
family. For Wales the relevant p value is 1 per cent, while for Scotland it is somewhat weaker at
7 per cent. These findings were robust to the addition of variables measuring household income,
economic activity and housing tenure.
The preceding analysis did not investigate social capital within Scotland. We now rectify
this by using data from the Scottish Household Survey for the two years (2001/02 and 2002/03)
to model some indicators of social capital collected by this survey.19 These capture similar
concepts to the General Household Survey. Hope et al (2003), which is the main source book on
the data, show that overall 51% of adult Scots report that their neighborhood is a ‘very good’
place to live compared to a low of 33% in Glasgow City and a high of 70% in both Orkney and
the Western Isles (Table 4.28).
Specifically we use the micro data to model whether respondents feel that they live in a
neighbourhood with “friendly people”, how they rate their neighbourhood as a place to live and
whether they feel safe when walking after dark. Using the appropriate ordered logit or probit
estimator, these indicators are regressed on age, economic status and a set of dummy variables
that distinguish thirteen areas within Scotland. Table 11 shows the coefficients on these
estimated area effects. Edinburgh City is the excluded category.
The results imply that some parts of Scotland are perceived as friendlier than Edinburgh,
including the Highlands and Southern Scotland. Within Strathclyde, Lanarkshire is perceived as
more friendly, Ayrshire less friendly and Glasgow not significantly different from Edinburgh.
19

See Hope et al (2003).

Again the Highlands and Southern Scotland are rated by their inhabitants as better places to live
than Edinburgh, but all parts of Strathclyde are perceived as worse, with the strongest effect in
Glasgow, followed by North Lanarkshire. Glasgow residents feel least safe venturing out after
dark. Indeed all parts of Strathclyde perform poorly on this indicator, while Tayside, Southern
Scotland and particularly the Highlands are perceived as safe.
Our first analysis showed that Scotland has levels of social capital at least as high as
those in England. However, our second analysis shows that there is wide variation within
Scotland and that again the areas which comprise Strathclyde are not seen as either particularly
good or safe places to live. Again, this evidence accords with our previous analyses of health,
crime and the labour market.
The final link in our puzzle is to relate the foregoing evidence to information on life
satisfaction. That is, we now present some data on how individuals in Scotland respond to
questions about how satisfied they are with the life they lead.
Life satisfaction and happiness
Data on life satisfaction are available in a number of sweeps of the Eurobarometer
survey. We make use of data for the period 1973-2003 excluding the years 1974, 1996 and 1999
when no data were available.

Data for a shorter number of years for Great Britain was

previously examined in Blanchflower and Oswald (2004a). Life satisfaction for Great Britain is
tabulated below. It appears from these data that the Scots report lower levels of satisfaction than
those in Great Britain as a whole
As we noted above data are also available on happiness in the Eurobarometers for the
years 1975-1979 and then again for 1982-1986. Individuals also report their life satisfaction;
below we tabulate responses from both happiness and life satisfaction for 14,341 respondents

from Great Britain and then separately for 1,536 observations from Scotland. We report the
overall percentages in each cell so 17% means that 17% of the sample said both that they were
very happy and were very satisfied with their life. It is clear from both measures of wellbeing
that the Scots are less happy and less satisfied with life than is the case for the British population
as a whole. Overall 31% report being very satisfied with life compared with 24% in Scotland
while 26% report being very happy overall compared with 21% of Scots. The vast majority of
the sample is on the main diagonal, suggesting the two measures are highly correlated.
We now focus on life satisfaction as this is available for a long run of years as well as for
the recent period: it also includes data from Southern Ireland. Table 10 reports ordered logit
models of life satisfaction and for males and females separately in columns 1-3; columns 4-6
separates Scotland into five separate components – Strathclyde, Borders, Highlands and Islands,
Grampian. It is only possible from 1989 on to identify the regions within Scotland so for the
years prior to 1989 we include only a Scotland pre 1989 dummy. Table 10 reports results for the
UK as a whole and includes controls for age and its square, gender, schooling, labor market
status and a time trend. Confirming findings in Blanchflower and Oswald (2004a) there is an
upward trend in happiness. Males are less satisfied with their lives than females though the trend
for men is upward, while females’ life satisfaction shows no distinct trend. Married people are
happier than single people and happiness is U-shaped in age. Individuals who are married are
more satisfied than individuals who are living together. Separated individuals are especially
miserable. After allowing for these influences, it is still the case that residing in Scotland has a
negative and significant effect on life satisfaction whatever time period is used. Residents of
Strathclyde are particularly unhappy and this is true both for men and women. In two recent
papers Blanchflower and Oswald (2005, 2006) also found that happiness, and other measures of

wellbeing including job satisfaction, and suicide were correlated in Australia; happiness was low
in Australia compared with other English speaking countries but it also has the highest suicide
rate.20
Our wellbeing results do not control for social capital. Nevertheless our previous
regressions with various measures of social capital suggest that, on average, indicators of social
capital in Scotland are no worse than in England or Wales. However, the detailed analysis within
Scotland shows that social capital indicators for the Strathclyde area are relatively low. This is
consistent with the lower self-reported wellbeing in this part of Scotland.
5. Conclusions & Policy Lessons
Let’s now return to the issue of economic growth, which is where we started. Our paper
paints a relatively depressing picture of Scotland over a range of objective and subjective
indicators of health, welfare and wellbeing. Interestingly, the wellbeing indicators are all telling
a consistent story; Scotland has low levels of wellbeing whether we look at suicide, depression or
life satisfaction. Some of these indicators may stem from economic factors, while others have a
basis in the social and cultural environment and possibly even the Scottish gene pool (in respect
of some diseases which have a strong inherited predisposition). Economic factors are likely only
to make a difference at the margin to these welfare outcomes. Nevertheless, as mentioned above,
economic growth is accorded the highest priority in terms of the policy ambitions of the Scottish
Executive. Increased growth will involve some combination of more workers and/or higher
incomes. How will this impact on welfare outcomes?
It is clear from our analysis that incomes among the employed in Scotland are not
substantially lower than in other parts of the UK. And household income has been increasing
rapidly in real terms, particularly among those households with employed people on low
20

Leigh and Wolfers (2006) argue that Australia’s ranking on happiness is higher using an earlier dataset.

earnings. As a consequence poverty levels have been declining. Indeed, the proportions of
households on low incomes or in receipt of social security benefits is not that much different than
in the rest of the UK (Table 1). However, though employment levels in Scotland are high, there
is still a substantial pool of inactivity, often associated with poor health, and particularly
concentrated in Strathclyde in general and Glasgow City in particular. Our results show that
higher incomes for this group will not necessarily improve their wellbeing. And Deaton and
Paxson’s work implying that there is not necessarily a strong link between mortality rates and
income levels in the UK does not suggest that higher incomes will necessarily improve health
outcomes.
There is no prima facie evidence that public goods provision enhances individuals’
wellbeing. Further, public spending has increasingly focused on those areas with high levels of
deprivation. Yet our analysis shows no discernible improvements of outcomes in Strathclyde
compared with the rest of Scotland in recent years. Indeed, some indicators, such as violent
crime, appear to be worsening. This suggests that the economic levers on health and wellbeing
are much less powerful than economists and politicians have imagined. In consequence, the
solutions to the many problems we have described may have more to do with institutions and
social structure rather than higher public spending and increased private income. Part of the
lesson must be that the economic policy cannot be divorced from social and health policy as well
as from institutional change. Although inactivity and unemployment have adverse effects on
wellbeing, it would also be wrong to focus development strategies simply on trying to get the
inactive and unemployed back into work, since this does not address the mechanism whereby
these individuals have very low wellbeing outcomes.

The paper has also shown that economic, health and social problems in Scotland have a
geographic focus. The difficulties experienced in Strathclyde especially may have their roots in
the demise of production industries in recent decades, but the consequences in terms of poorer
lifestyle-related physical and mental health, more adverse labour market outcomes and lowered
wellbeing seem both persistent through time and resistant to policy initiatives aimed at reducing
inequalities in health and labour market outcomes. Based on our analysis it seems that policies
aimed at raising economic growth, such as those advocated by the Scottish Executive, are
unlikely to be successful in raising the overall wellbeing of the Scots. Policies targeted at
lowering suicide, improving the diet of Scotland’s citizens, reducing alcohol consumption and
cutting cigarette smoking are more likely to be successful. Scotland'
s fate still hangs in the
balance.

Dprobit reports marginal effect rather than coefficients. That is, it gives the change in the
probability for an infinitesimal change in each independent, continuous variable and reports the
discrete change in the probability for dummy variables.

Notes: region is based on residence. Excluded categories are white and employee. Ages 16-64. Source: Labor Force Survey: March
1992-May 2005. Each quarter from Spring 92 to Winter 92. Summer and Winter quarters only from Summer 93 to Winter 95. Each
quarter from Spring 96 to Winter 96. The respondents are asked whether they have health problems or disabilities which limit the
kind of paid work they can do. Respondents are not asked about the extent of the limitation. Each quarter to Winter 96 respondents
reported that they had '
depression, bad nerves'and reported up to three '
health problems which affect you the most'
. From Winter
1996 on respondents reported on their most important health problem with the classification now changed to '
depression, bad nerves
or anxiety'
. Robust standard errors. All equations also include 47 schooling dummies and 11 month dummies.
