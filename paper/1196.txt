Management in an Overlapping Generations Economy
Optimal

ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes exchange rate management in a simple overlapping

generations model. This framework is used to evaluate alternative policies

in terms of their implications for the welfare of individuals in the economy.
The analysis identifies two objectives of monetary

policy,

desirable store of value and collecting seigniorage. When

providing a
the

chief

concern

is to provide a desirable store of value (as when the monetary authority's
major constituency consists of the asset holders of the economy), a policy
of fixing the exchange rate does better when shocks are primarily of domestic
origin while floating becomes more desirable when foreign shocks predominate.
When seigniorage concerns are paramount (as when the authority's constituency
is the young generation) flexible rates do

are paramount

better.

When seigniorage concerns

and when the monetary authority cannot establish a reputation

for conducting monetary policy in a way that makes the currency a desirable

store of value, a national currency may not be viable

in

the absence of

exchange controls. Such controls may be justified in this situation.

1. Introduction
The design
that has

BUiter

received

of

monetary policy and exchange rate management is a topic

considerable attention in the last five years. Papers by

(1979), Turnovsky (1983), Buiter and Eaton (1980), Eaton and

Turnovsky

(1980) and Frenkel and Aizenman (1982) are examples of models that consider

the optimality of alternative stabilization rules. The models used to
evaluate alternative monetary and

exchange

optimal policies suffer from

deficiencies that this paper attempts to

four

rate policies and to derive

address.
First, models

are constructed on the basis of a number of aggregate macro-

economic relationships that are not derived from underlying preferences and
technologies. Their usefulness for policy evaluation is therefore questionable
for the reason given by Lucas (1976): changes in policy may

lead

to changes in

these aggregate relationships. Output supply and asset demands are examples of
functional relationships that may be sensitive to policy changes.

Second, po1cy evaluation is based upon ad hoc objective functions of the
government rather than upon a comparison of the welfare of individuals in the

economy under alternative policies. Assuming that the government is responsive
to the welfare of its citizens its policy objectives should derive from the

preferences of individuals in the economy. When individual objective functions
are specified alternative policies can then be evaluated in terms of their
effects on individuals' utilities.

Third, discussion of optimal monetary policy in open economies has typically
ignored the role of national monies in generating seigniorage for their govern-

ments. Fischer (1982) has recently discussed seigniorage as an objective of

2

monetary

policy but provides no formal analysis. In fact, in some countries

seigniorage constitutes a major source of revenue, possibly because it constitutes the administratively least expensive and least distortionary form

of

taxation.
Fourth, optimal policies are typically derived from the class of closed

-

loop

policies. As Kydland and Prescott (1977) have emphasized, such policies

may not be time consistent. For many of the models discussed above the
optimal closed loop and optimal feedback policies coincide.' Once seigniorage
considerations are introduced, however, they diverge.

This paper develops a model of an open economy derivative of the Samuelson
(1958) pure consumption loan model.2 Individuals have available to them as a

store of value a

rate

foreign currency which depreciates in value at a stochastic

that is exogenous to the economy under consideration. The population

growth rate of this economy is also an exogenous stochastic process.

The government of this economy has the ability to provide its own currency

as a store of value. Individuals choose their first period consumption and
•

allocate their savings between the two currencies to maximize the expected

utility of consumption over two periods. There is no individual bequest motive.
New money issue is used to finance government expenditure which is assumed to

benefit only the younger generation. It is assumed that foreigners do not
hold the domestic currency, possibly because of exchange controls or the fear

of

exchange controls in the future. Otherwise the exchange rate would be

indeterminate, as demonstrated by

store of value is an additional goal. The objectives of monetary policy to
major goals

a desirable store of value and to

run.

3
-

When the primary objective of the monetary

authority is to provide a
desirable store of value, one insight of the previous literature
reemerges:

a policy of predetermining the exchange rate each period tends to yield
higher welfare when the foreign price level is stable relative to domestic
output and conversely. A policy of having no national currency at all,
relying solely upon the foreign currency as a store of value, can in some

circumstances

dominate a policy of having a currency fixed in value in

terms of the foreign currency or freely floating against it. When the
primary

function

of the monetary authority is to generate seigniorage, however,

a policy of pure floating always dominates a fixed exchange rate policy or a
policy of having no national currency.

When seigniorage considerations are present, a government that attempts
to maximize the welfare only of the current young

generation cannot sustain

a currency. The only time consistent policy leads to a nonmonetary economy.
Introducing the expected utility of future generations as a public good can

reverse this result, however. Alternatively, when earning seigniorage is not
an objective3'

time consistent policy can correspond to the optimal

closed loop policy.4
Section 2 derives the optimal savings and portfolio behavior of each

atomistic individual in the economy under consideration. Section 3 imbeds
this behavior in a simple, aggregate model to derive the behavior of the
domestic price level and the exchange rate as functions of exogenous vari-

ables and policy parameters. The expected welfare of each generation in a
nonmonetary economy is derived In section 4, and is compared with expected
welfare under fixed and flexible exchange rate regimes for a monetary economy.
Section 5 considers optimal feedback policies under alternative social welfare

and individual utility functions. Section 6 discusses the role of reputation
as a means of enforcing a monetary economy and the optimal closed loop policy.
Some concluding remarks appear in section 7.

2. Optimal Consumption and Portfolio Behavior
Consider an economy of the Saxnuelson (1958) pure consumption loan

variety. Individuals live two periods, earning an amount Y in the first
period of their lives and nothing in the second period. An individual
i entering the labor force in period t seeks to maximize a utility function
of the form:

+ 8 log C0+ 1 + w Ct

log

(2.1)

where C1 denotes i's consumption in the working period, CO+ in the retirement period, and G denotes per worker government spending in the working
period. Individuals are assumed not to derive utility from government spend—
'ing

in

their retirement period. The parameter w indicates the weight placed

on government spending relative to private consumption.

Individuals have available to them as stores of value a domestic money

and a foreign money. There is a single traded good, the price of which, in

period t, is P in terms of domestic money and

in terms of foreign money.

Exact purchasing power parity (PPP) obtains so that

This section has characterized the optimal consumption and portfolio
behavior of a single individual facing a given level of government spending

and distributions of the foreign and domestic price levels and the exchange

behavior of the domestic price level and exchange rate from aggregate
characteristics of the economy and from government policy.

Following much of the previous literature on exchange rate intervention
this model assumes that the only contemporaneous variable that the government

observes is the exchange rate. (See, e.g. (Buiter (1979), Turnovsky (1983),
Buiter and Eaton (1980), Eaton and Turnovsky (1980), Frenkel and Aizenman (19E2)).
On the basis of information available at the end of the previous period the

government sets a monetary growth rate g that is subject to revision in
response to new information embodied in the exchange rate. The actual money
growth rate is therefore

The only cost to establishing a currency with ixed rates relative to a no
currency situation is the variability in seign.orage. This cost increases
with the variance of the foreign price leveland the domestic growth rate.
The benefit is the ability either to earn seigniorage on domestic currency or

else to establish the Golden Rule interest rate. Either bnef it increases with
the term 11* + n, or the difference between the world interest rate (_fl*) and the
domestic growth rate.

In view of this complication it is considerably simpler to focus on two

particular special cases, one in which seigniorage effects are negligible (W=O),
and one in which they are paramount (wW=oo).

Each is treated in turn.

(4.19)

Since both (4.17) and (4.19) are positive, while in a nonmonetary economy
seigniorage is zero, when seigniorage dominates the welfare function a monetary
policy with flexible rates always yields higher expected utility than a non-monetary economy.

Under fixed rates seigniorage earnings are stochastic because of the need
to intervene in the foreign exchange market to stabilize the currency.

The

appropriate comparison,then, is between expected seigniorage under
the two regimes. Normalizing (4.8) by dividing through by Lh note that maxirnum
expected seigniorage under fixed rates as w goes to infinity is

E(S)

[fl* + —

(2 ÷ a2)]W

(4.20)

By comparing (4.20) with (4.17) and (4.19) it can be shown that maximum

expected

seigniorage is necessarily higher under perfectly flexible exchange

rates. When rates are perfectly flexible disturbances in the foreign price
level affect neither the domestic price level nor the amount of money creation.
They consequently do not affect real per capita seigniorage. Disturbances in
the domestic population growth rate create domestic price level disturbances

in the opposite direction. The two cancel each other to the point where, as a

18

first—order approximation,real seignorage

capita is non—stochastic.

When exchange rates are fixed, however, variation in the domestic price
level and population growth rate are no longer perfectly negatively

correlated. As a consequence of Jensen's inequality, expected real
seignorage per capita is lower. This effect is not offset by the fact

under

that

fixed rates more money can be created, on average, without

leading to substitution into the foreign currency. Under fixed rates

5. Optimal Feedback and Closed Loop Policies
The last section compared expected utility in a situation in which the

monetary

authority

pegs the exchange rate each period with one in which it

sets the money supply independently of the exchange rate. It was assumed that

the monetary authority could precommit itself to a monetary response that
maximizes the expected utility of each generation.
The monetary authority may,

however, respond only to the wishes of

generations present at the time the monetary policy is implemented. At this

point

the money holdings of the old generation are a bygone, while the demand

for money of the young geieration depends upon its expectations of policy in a

later period. If current policy has no effect on expectations of future policy
the monetary authority will establish a level of monetary growth each period
taking as given monetary policies in other periods and existing asset
holdings.
In period t, then, the authority selects

and a to maximize

a weighted

average of the old and young generation.' utilities. Let a denote the weight

assigned to the young generation's utility and 1—a the weight to the old
generation's utility.

A time consistent policy is a choice of g and a that maximizes

When seigniorage earnings do not affect utility ( = 0) the young

generation is unaffected by current policy. Situations in which séigniorage
effects are absent (w = 0) and in which the old generation dominates the
social welfare function (a = 0) thus imply equivalent welfare criteria.
Similarly, equivalent welfare criteria emerge when seigniorage effects are

paramount (ô = co) and when the young generation dominates the social
welfare function (a = 1).

One result of this section is that when the young generation dominates
•the social welfare function or when seigniorage dominates the individual
utility function (i.e., when a = 1 when °F w = co) then time consistent (or

optimal feedback) policy cannot sustain a monetary economy. The consequent
equilibrium is in general inferior to the optimum that would emerge if the
monetary authority could precommit itself to an alternative policy (i.e.,

to choosing the optimal closed loop policy). A second result is that when
the old generation dominates the social welfare function or when seigniorage
does not appear in the individual utility function (i.e., when a = 0 or u = 0)
then time consistent policy may also yield a nonmonetary economy or it may yield
the optimal closed loop policy.

An intuitive explanation for the optimality of this equilibrium is that the
larger the share of domestic currency in portfolios, the closer are the expected

domestic interest rate facing consumers and the expected growth rate. A lower value of
A thus brings the economy closer to the Golden Rule, thereby raising welfare.

The

reduce risk. The incentive that the monetary ruthorities have to minimize the
risk associated with domestic currency each period leads them to stabilize the
exchange rate in an optimal way.

6. The Role of Reputation in Enforcing a Monetary Economy
A conclusion of the previous section is that when earning seigniorage
is the predominant concern of the monetary authority, or that when the
utility of the young generation dominates the social welfare function,
then a time consistent policy cannot sustain a monetary equilibrium. It

was assumed that the only objective of the monetary authority is
to maximize

a

weighted average of the expected utilities of generations currently present.
An alternative objective is to maximize a weighted average of the expected

utilities of current and all future generations. A reason for the monetary
authority to take into account the welfare of future generations is that their
welfare constitutes a public good to current generations, i.e., the utility of
future generations as a group affects the welfare of the current generations,

but no atomistic member of •a current generation has an incentive to provide
a bequest to any member of the subsequent generation. In'this context the
monetary authority's incentive to maintain the reputation of its currency to
allow future generations to earn seigniorage can lead to the time consistency
of a monetary economy.

7. Conclusion
This paper has analysed exchange rate management in avery simple
overlapping generations model. The purpose has been to evaluate monetary
policy in an open economy on the basis of its implications for the welfare

of individuals in the economy. While this paper has used

a micro—

economic framework for analysing monetary policy, it has done so at the
expense of omitting a number of important features of open economies that

have received attention elsewhere. For example, in this model government
debt provides th2 oaiy store of value. There is no productive capital and
no distinction Letween assets that are held as stores of value and for

transactions purposes. The implications of policy for output and employment
are not considered. The lack of a consensus about the microeconomic causes
of these phenomena makes

their

incorporation into an analysis of this sort
-

difficult.

The analys:.s in this paper identifies two objectives of monetary policy:
to provide a desirable store of value, i.e., one with a high and stable rate
of return, and to collect seigniorage. Despite the difference in approach

between

this and other studies some similar results emerge.7 In particular.

While having a national currency may be desirable from a national welfare
perspective, tine consistent policy on the part of the monetary authority may

be unable to sustain a currency. This result is most likely to emerge when the
primary concern of the monetary authority is the extraction of seigniorage (as

when its

major

constituency is the young

generation) and when It is unable to

28

develop a reputation (as when the monetary authority is not perceived as a

continuous, infinitely—lived organization). The fact that seigniorage provides a major source of revenue in some countries suggests why these are also

countries that must institute exchange controls: the police power of the state
is used to maintain the viability of domestic currency faced with competition

from foreign currencies. When seigniorage provides the least distortionary
source of government revenue at the margin, such policies may be optimal.

This paper has considered government liabilities that take the form of

currency. Introducing a coupon on this liability would not affect the analysis.
Hence the model applies to government borrowing generally rather than simply to
monetary issue.

Introducing a distinction between

monetary and non—monetary

debt would require introducing a transactions motive for holding money. This

aspect of the microfoundatjons of exchange rate management has been explored
by Stockinan

(1980) and Helpman (1981). An integration of 'the portfolio con-

siderations examined

here and the transactions motives treated in this other

literature constitutes an important topic for future research.

FOOTNOTES

1. See Kydland (1977) for a discussion of the distinction between
closed loop and feedback policies. See Calvo (1978) for
a discussion of optimal and time consistent monetary policies
in a non—stochastic closed economy context.
2. Exchange rate policy has also been examined in an overlapping
generations context by Lapan and Enders (1979, 1980), Aizenman
(1981) and Hsieh (1982). These papers assume that private
individuals are unable to hold foreign assets. Exchange
rate intervention therefore creates a scope for capital mobility
that otherwise would be absent. A comparison between exchange
rate regimes therefore, implicitly, involves a comparison
of different degrees of capital mobility. In contrast this
paper assumes that private individuals can hold foreign assets.
Hence the degree of capital mobility is fixed across regimes.
Heipman and Razin (1979) provide a discussion of this point.
3. Lapan and Endérs (1983) and Nickelsburg (1981) show, in general how
actual and potential capital controls can lead to a unique
exchange rate.

4. This paper considers monetary policy ma single small open
economy in which collection of seiiorage isa pOlicy goal.
Buiter and Eaton (1983) have analysed the interaction of
the monetary policies of' several countries in a deterministic
overlapping generations context, also focussing on the sei1iorage
issue.

5. An equivalent assumption for the purposes of this analysis
is that other revenue sources are inelastically supplied
in some amount T and that the utility function (2.1) is of
the form:

log C +

8 log

+ w

( + Gt)

Alternatively, the utility function could incorporate deadweight
losses from other sources of tax revenue as well as the benefits
from government spending.

6. The optimal value of the intervention parameter a, when seigniorage
considerations are absent, is derived in Section 5 below.
7.

In

principle, seigniorage considerations could be introduced
into a much wider class of macroeconomic models to derive
optiinai. policy rules. A number of' conclusions derived in
the simple overlapping generations model used here are likely
to emerge in more general models.
