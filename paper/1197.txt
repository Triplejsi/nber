The Profitability of Currency Speculation

ABSTRACT

This paper presents the results of a post—sample simulation of a
speculative strategy using a portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts.

The main new
filters

to

features of the speculative strategy are (a)

the use of Kalman

update the forecasting equation, (b) the allowance for transactions,

costs and margin requirements and (c) the endogenous determination of the
leveraging

of the portfolio. While the forecasting model tended to overesti-

mate profit and underestimate risk, the strategy was still profitable over a
three year period and it was possible to reject the hypothesis that the sum of
profits was zero. Furthermore, the currency portfolio was found to have an
extremely low market risk. Combinations of the speculative currency portfolio
with traditional portfolios of U.S. equities resulted in considerable
improvements in risk—adjusted returns on capital.

DITRODUCT EON

In an earlier

study, Bilson (1981), a strategy for speculating ifl the

foreign—exchange forward market was described. The strategy involved using
econometric techniques to evaluate the forecasting efficiency of forward
exchange rates, and financial techniques to estimate

portfolios of forward contracts. The econometric

mean—variance optimal

analysis suggested that a

composite forecast which included both the spot rate and the forward rate
provided a statistically superior forecast of the future spot rate than did the

forward rate by itself. In addition, it was not possible to reject the hypothesis that the weight given to the forward rate in a composite forecast should
be zero, a result which implies that the

spot exchange—rate evolves as a random

walk. Since the difference between the forward rate and the spot rate at any
point in time is directly related to the difference in nominal interest rates,
the econometric analysis suggested a speculative strategy which involved

in low—interest—rate currencies and lending in high—interest—rate
currencies. Since movements in foreign—exchange rates are correlated, the mean
borrowing

variance

portfolio technique was employed to determine the optimal positions in

the set of nine currencies considered. The

results demonstrated that a specu-

lator who had employed the model would have realized an extremely high ratio of
profit to risk.

The research reported here is a part of the NBER's research in
International Studies. Any opinions expressed are those of the authors and not

Jorion for research assistance on both the theoretical and empirical aspects of
the paper.

These results have recently been confirmed by a number of other Studies.
Hodrick and Srivastava (1983) consider an extended model in which the composite
forecast includes the premiums or discounts on all of the currencies in the

sample. Their estimates of the profitability of speculative trading in

foreign

currencies are slightly less favorable than those reported in the earlier

paper, but they are nevertheless large and statistically significant. Fama
(1983) and Korajcyzk (1983) also find that spot rates out—perform forward rates

as forecasts of future spot rates. Furthermore, studies by Silson (1983),
Levich (1981), and Meese and Rogoff (1982) demonstrate that the spot rate forecasts are generally superior to forecasts generated by standard academic
exchange rate models and by commercial foreign exchange forecasting serices.

The consensus appears to be that exchange rates evolve as a random walk, and
that nominal interest rate differentials do not reflect market expectations of
changes in the exchange rate.

The apparent profitability of currency speculation may be interpleted in a

number of ways. First, it could be the case that the results are specific to
the particular sample and

that

the apparent profits would fail to be realized

in post—sample speculations. Second, it could be the case that the actual risk
of the activity has been understated, either because of the failure of a low
probability outcome to occur in the sample, or because the measure of risk
employed (the standard deviation of the profit on the portfolio) is not an
accurate estimate of the! 'market' risk of the activity. Finally, it could be
the case that the market is 'inefficient.' Taken at face value, the results

suggest a world in which interest rates are basically determined by domestic
conditions, including the expected rate of inflation of domestic commodity

prices and domesticmonetary policies, and in which there is 'insufficient'
uncovered interest arbitrage (Mclcinnon (19791, chapter 7). If it is true that

If the forward—parity model is correct, the regression coefficient '8' should

not he significantly different from zero. On the other hand, if the random
walk model is correct, the estimate of '8' should not be significantly differ-

ent from unity. The purpose of the econometric analysis is to determine an
appropriate estimate of the weights in the composite forecast. In addition, an
estimate of the covariance matrix of the forecast errors is also required.
There are a number of issues that must be addressed in the estimation of

the regression coefficients. First, in order to control for heteroscedas—
ticity, we assume that the variance of the residuals is proportional to the

square of the spot exchange rate. Hence we adjust the equation by dividing
through by the spot exchange rate. Second, we take account of the correlation
in the forecast errors through the use of the seemingly unrelated regression

procedure developed by Zellner (1962]. Third, we take account of the colinear—
ity between the spot and forward rates by imposing the constraint that the
weights in the composite forecast sun to unity.
Other

of

the

aspects of the estimation procedure have been dictated by

the nature

data. Since the variance of the residuals is large relative to the sam-

ple variation in the exogenous variables, it is extremely difficult to obtain

precise estimates of the weihts in the composite forecast. We increase the
signal to noise ratio by imposing the constraint that the weights in the com-

posite forecast are the same for all currencies. By combining low—interest—
rate

currencies like the Swiss

franc

with high—interest—rate currencies like

—3—

exchange rates evolve as a random walk, then nominal interest rates on assets

denominated in different currencies should be approximately the same. In a
world in which speculators used the random walk model, it is more likely that
both exchange rates and interest rates would be more stable (Bilson [1982] ).

Our purpose in this paper is to investigate the above—mentioned issues.
We consider the problem of sample specificity by examining the post—sample

performance of the earlier model over a three—year period, We address one of
the sources of excessive profitability by allowing for transactions costs in
both the estimation of the optimal portfolios and in the statistical evaluation

of the strategy. Finally, we examine both the absolute risk and the market
risk of the strategy by examining the correlation between the return on the

currency portfolio and the return on the s&P 500 index. Furthermore, we
introduce an extended mean—variance portfolio algorithm that allows for the
endogenous determination of the leverage on the portfolio.

I. &ONOI4ETRICS

Our forecasting etluation may be considered as a synthesis of two popular

characterizations of asset price—movements, the first is the forward parity
model in which the best forecast of the spot price in any future period is the

forward rate for that maturity. The second is the random walk model in which
the best forecast of the spot price in any future period is the current spot

price. In this study, we shall be concerned with forecasting spot exchange
rates over a four week horizon. In order to do so, we create a composite forecast from the spot rate and the one—month forward rate)

The use of a one month forward rate with a four-week horizon was dictated
by our data source. Similar results have been obtained with other data. See,
for example, Korajczyk [1983]; Hansen and Srivastava (1983).

the Italian lira, we increase the sample variation in the right hand-side variables and lower the variance of the estimated coefficient. Finally, we take
account of the tact that extremely large values of the right hand—side variable

occur on occasion. In the

original

sample of 666 observations (9 currencies by

74 time periods), there were 55 instances, or approximately 8 percent of the
sample, in which the value of the regressor exceeded 10 percent per annum in

absolute value. In order to avoid having the results biased by these extreme
values, we allow for separate weights for values that exceed 10 percent in
absolute value.

The data for the original study consisted of observations taken on the
Friday

of every fourth week on the spot rate and the one month forward rate.

The data covered nine currencies——Canadian dollar, British pound, Belgian

franc, French franc, Deutsche mark, Italian lira, Dutch guilder, Swiss franc,
and Japanese yen——over the period from July 1974 to January 1980. Further
details may be found in Bilson 119811. For present purposes, all that we
require are

the

final results.

results offer strong support to the random—walk model of exchange—

movements. For small values of the forward premium or discount, the opti-

mal forecast

of the future spot rate assigns 74 percent of the weight in the

—6—

composite to the spot rate. The 26 percent weight assigned to the forward rate
is not significantly different from zero at the 5 percent significance level.
The results are even more extreme for the large values, where the weight on the

forward rate is negative. For both large and small values,

the forward—parity

model is decisively rejected: the weight given to the forward rate in the
composite forecast is significantly less than unity in both cases.

As was mentioned above, these results are not new. They were initially
distributed as an NBER Working

Paper in

April 1980, and subsequently published

in the Journal of Business in 1981. They consequently offer an opportunity for
examining

the post—sample performance of the forecasting equation. For our

The end of sample estimates (.8892, 1.1707) are not greatly different from the

original estimates. We also update the covariance matrix of the forecast
errors. In each period, we compute a covariance matrix using the past 16 forecast errors. This adjustment is important since changing monetary arrangements, including the "snake," the "tunnel,' and the European Monetary System,

have a definite influence on the covariation between exchange rates. While the
16—period moving window is an extremely simple way of accounting for these
changes, it is certainly superior to the alternative of no adjustment at all.

U. THE SPECtJLArtv STRATEGY
The econometric analysis yields forecasts of the spot exchange rate
for
four weeks hence for each of the nine currencies and of the covariance
matrix

the forecast errors. In this section, we describe a technique which uses
this information as an input and creates a vector of positions (long or short)
in each currency. In our context, a position is a forward contract to buy or
sell the currency. The speculator offsets the forward contract at its maturity
of

by buying or selling an offsetting amount of currency in the spot market. Hence

the gross profit on the transaction is equal to the difference between the

forward rate at t, F(n, t), and the subsequent spot rate, S(n, t + 1),
multiplied by the quantity of foreign currency purchased or sold. For ease of
interpretation, we value all of the forward positions in U. S. dollars at the
current spot rate, S(n, t). Hence

(3)

Gross Profits =

[(S(n,

t + 1) —

F(n,t))/S(n,t)J

S(n,t)Q(n,t)

where Q(n,t) represents the amount of foreign currency purchased or sold in
the forward market. We simplify our notation by writing this definition as

(4)

Gross Profits =

r(n,t)q(n,t)

—8—

where r(n,t) =

(Sn,

t+1) —

F(n,t))/S(n,t)

and q(n,t) =

S(n,t)Q(n,t).

The

quantity, q(n,t), represents the dollar value of the position and r(n,t)
represents the profit per dollar of position. It is also the endogenous variable in the econometric forecasting equation.
One important feature of the speculative model is that it takes account of

transactions costs in assessing the optimal positions. The transactions costs
are assumed to be 0.1 percent for the major currencies (CD, BP, DM, SF, fiG, J)

and 0.2 percent for the less—traded currencies (BF, FF, IL). Thus we assume
that it costs US$1000 to purchase one million dollars worth of British pounds,

and US$2000 to purchase one million dollars worth of Italian lira. Allowance

transactions costs is of particular importance during periods in which two
or more currencies are highly correlated because of monetary arrangements.
for

Under these conditions, small differences in the premium or discount against
the

dollar would lead to extremely large spread positions if transactions costs

not accounted for.

The speculator is assumed to choose a vector of positions in order to
maximize a utility function defined over expected profits, E(w)

The

IJ[E(7r), V(ir)J = E(7T) —

(jx)v(1r)

The 'A' parameter represents the speculator's degree of risk aversion. The
'A' may be interpreted in the following way. If the speculator is offered the
opportunity to multiply the outcome of a drawing from a normal distribution
with a mean and standard deviation of unity by a certain number of dollars, and
if the speculator receives the product if positive or pays if the product is

negative, then 'A' represents the number of dollars by which that outcome

—9—

will be multiplied.3 In the following simulations, we assume a value for 'A1
of $100. This assumption is inconsegential, since the positions and profits

are all proportional to this parameter. The rate of return, and the ratio of
profit to risk (standard deviation), are independent of the assumed degree of
risk aversity.

The expected net dollar profit on the portfolio is defined as

(6)

E(TT) =

where 'q' is an N x 1

qr —

gc

vector whose typical value is the dollar value of

the position taken in the nth currency. The typical element of the N X

1

vector 'r' is the expected bias in the forward rate, expressed as a fraction
of the current spot rate, r(n, t). The second term in equation (6), Jg'c,
represents the allowance for transactions costs. The costs are assumed to be
the product of the absolute value of the position and the transactions cost per

dollar purchased or sold, 'c'.
The variance of profits is defined is equation (7)

V(1r)qaq

(7)

2 represents the N X N covariance matrix of the forecast errors.
Substituting the definitions of expected profit and the variance of profit
into the utility function allows for the level of utility to be expressed as a

function of the vector of control variables, q. It is, however, difficult to
maximize the function directly with respect to these variables because of the

level of profits when the_distribution is N(1,1). More generally, kE(ir)

This formulation demonstrates that the effect of the transactions costs is
to add a positive diagonal terms to the covariance matrix. Since the transactions costs reduce the apparent correlation between

the returns, allos.iing for

transactions costs will reduce spread positions and bias the estimated optimal
positions towards zero.

Differentiating U(•) with respect to the vector q and setting the
resulting first order conditions equal to zero, yields the following solution
for the optimal portfolio.

q = [2+C] —1 Ar
The only difficulty with the estimation of the positions from this

equation is that the transactions cost matrix C depends upon the value of the
positions. We solve this problem iteratively. In the first iteration, the

elements of C are set equal to zero. We then use (11) to estimate q* and
we then use q* to estimate the elements of C.
the position estimates stabilize.

This process continues until

In Table 1, we illustrate, the optimization procedures by providing a

detailed description of a particular portfolio. This portfolio is not representative, since it has both the highest expected and highest actual
but it offers a clear demonstration of the speculative

profit,

strategy. The position

was taken on May 22, 1981, and realized on June 191 1981. At that time, French
and Italian interest rates were high relative to Swiss, German and Dutch inter-

est rates. Hence the optimal portfolio basically consisted of long positions
in French francs and Italian lira offset by an equally valued short position in

the Dutch guilder. It is noticeable that the program avoided a short position
in the Japanese yen despite the large (13.62 percent per annum) premium on this

currency, and that the net dollar position was small. Because of the higher
correlation between the seven European currencies than between the dollar, yen
and the Europeans, most of the positions taken by the program consist of

spreads between the European currencies. This fact will become 'more important

when the market risk of the speculative strategyis evaluated.
The illustrative portfolio can also be used to demonstrate the concept of

the return on the portfolio that we shall use. Since the forward market positions do not require the placement of capital, it is often said that' the return

on forward contracts is either plus or minus infinity. However, even when a
large corporation obtains a foreign—exchange guideline from a bank, the bank
will typically require some deposits with the bank in order tc ensure delivery.
In addition, the transactions costs may be considered as an initial investment.

We assume a margin requirement of 10 percent of the absolute value of the
position, and we define the capital investment as being equal to the margin

plus the transactions cost. In calculating the return on the investment, we

assume that the speculator earns the Treasury Bill rate on the
margin. Hence
the total profit is equal to the profit front the

speculative activity plus the

interest on the margin minus the transactions costs.

Using this definition,

our most successful portfolio earned a return of almost 10 percent over the
four-week period.
In Table

2,

summary statistics relating to the performance of the port—

folio over the period from February 1980 to December 1982 are presented. The

table offers an excellent example of the endogenous determination of the lever-

aging of the portfolio. The 'safety ratio,' defined as the ratio of expected
profit to the expected standard deviation of profit, is the most important determinant of the degree of leveraging. The scale of the position in the market

is proportional to the square of the safety ratio.4 When the safety ratio is
around unity, the expected gross profit is around $100; when the safety ratio
is increases to around 5, the expected gross profit increases to around $2500.
It is noticeable that a large part of the total actual profits were made in a
few periods when the safety ratio was high.

The fact that the expected profits are proportional to the square of the
safety ratio implies an important difference between the econometric and the

financial analysis of speculative efficiency. In the econometric evaluation,
concern is taken to ensure that the residuals in the regression are serially
uncorrelated and hognoscedastic. However, a speculator using the econometric
results will weight the observations by the square of the safety ratio so that

the unanticipated profit series will be strongly heteroscedastic. It is
straightforward to demonstrate that the expected variance of profit is

Since the validity of equation (12) is an important component of both the
evaluation of the speculative strategy and the econometric tests used in the
evaluation, we begin by examining this relationship in the post sample
simulation.

In order to test equation (12), we posit an extended model of the variance
of profits which includes both the level and the square of expected profits.

In the absence of other information, it appears reasonable to assume that the
variance of profit would be proportional to the square of expected profits

rather than the level. Hence this model constitutes a natural alternative to
the relationship predicted by the speculative strategy. The alternative is
tested against the maintained model by regressing the square of the error in

forecasting profit, minus the value predicted by the maintained model, on the
additional variables. The results of the estimation are presented below.

Although the individual parameters in equation (13) are not stastistically

significant, the F—statistic demonstrates that it is possible

to

reject the

hypothesis that all of the coefficients are zero. Furthermore, since all of
the parameters are positive, the variance predicted by the alternative model is
greater than the variance predicted by the maintained model.

—16—

The underestimation of the variance of profits is quite significant. In
order to illustrate the dimensions of the problem, we provide standard summary
statistics for the standard deviations forecasted by the maintained and alternative models.

On average, the alternative estimate is twice that predicted by the maintained

model. The extent of the downward bias appears to be greatest for the small
values.

The underestimation of the risk of the speculative strategy has two major

consequences for the evaluation. First, if the speculator had known the true
risk of the strategy, the scale of the position would have been reduced. Using
the maintained estimates, expected gross profits summed to $8,446 over the
sample

period. If the positions were re—estimated with the alternative risk

estimates,

expected profits would have summed to $2308. Hence the major part

of the profit realized from the positions taken was due to the fact that the

51n footnote 3, it was demonstrated that kE(Tr) = 82A. Since 32 = E(IT)2/V(lr),
the effect of the underestimation of the variance can be described by the

relationship

VA(W)

where

VE(71)

represents the maintained

estimate of the variance and VA(w) the alternative estimate. The average
value of VA(w)/vA(ir) is approximately .5, hence the underestimation of risk
caused the average scale of the position to be twice as large as the speculator
would have taken with full information.

—17—

speculator underestimated the true risk of the strategy. Second, the underestimation of the risk implies that the maintained estimates should not be used in
tests of the hypothesis that the actual profits realized are either signif j—

cantly different from zero or from the expected value. In

correcting for the

heteroscedasticity in the profit series, we shall use the alternative estimates
of the variances.

The first test of this type relates to the ability of the model to fore-

cast situations in which currency speculation is profitable. We exatne this
issue by testing whether expected profits provide unbiased forecasts of actual

profits. Our results are based on the estimates of the following regression
equation.

This equation was estimated using

weighted

least squares. The weights were the

reciprocals of the alternative estimates of the standard deviations. We
observe first that the coefficient on expected profits is significantly greater

than zero at standard significance levels. The t—statistic for testing if the
slope coefficient is unity is 1.935. With 37 degrees of freedom, we are unable
to reject the hypothesis that the true slope coefficient is unity at the five

percent level, but we are able to reject at the ten percent level. Furthermore, the constant term in the regression is negative. These considerations
lead to the presumption that the model is tending to overestimate the profits

from the trading strategy. If we use an F—test to test the joint hypothesis
that the constant term is zero and

the

slope coefficient is unity, the value of

—18—

the statistic turns out to be 3.74. The value is below the five percent critical value of the F—distribution with 1 and 37 degrees of freedom. We are
consequently unable to reject the hypothesis that the model is providing unbi-

ased forecasts of actual profits. It is, however, true that the most likely
direction of bias is towards overly optimistic estimates of expected profits.
It was mentioned above that, had the speculator known of the overestimation of the variance, he or she would have reduced the total expected gross

profits from $8,446 to $2,308, by reducing the scale of the position. The
knowledge that the model tended to overestimate the expected profits would also

a contraction in the scale of the position. Combining both the adjustment to the variance and the adjustment to expected profit, the total expected
induce

gross

profit would have been reduced to $841.6 The same point can be made from

the point •of view of the certainty equivalence value of the strategy. With the

utility function that we have posited, the certainty equivalence value of the

strategy is equal to one—half of the expected profit.7 That is, given the
degree of risk aversion, the speculator would be willing to pay up to one-half

of the expected profit in order to partake in the speculative strategy. Given
the

maintained estimates of expected profit and the variance of profit, our

speculator would be willing to pay up to $4223 to own the strategy. With the
actual estimates, the maximwn payment would be reduced to $420, and the scale
of the position would have been reduced in proportion to the reduction in

profits. In this sense, the post—sample performance of

the strategy

is disappointing.

While the

profits

from the strategy were

less

than predicted, and while

the risk was greater than predicted, it is still the case that the strategy was

profitable on average. Losses were realized on only eight of the 39 portfolios1 and the largest loss, $476, was considerably smaller than the largest gain

of $3049. We now examine the hypothesis that the sum of the actual profits is
zero. In testing this hypothesis, the variance of the sum is

sun

assumed to be the

of the variances predicted by the regression model presented in equation

(13). Since these estimates are typically larger than the maintained estimates, their use lessens the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis. We
test the hypothesis by computing the statistic

T
(15)

z=

t=1 t/

t

Under the assumption that the true residuals are normally and independently
distributed, this statistic follows a t—distribution with 38 degrees of

freedom. The computed value of the test statistic is 3.298. This value
exceeds the one percent critical value of the t—distribution with 38 degrees of

freedom. We consequently reject the hypothesis that the true sum of profits is
zero. This test is probably the most important test for purposes of testing
the efficiency of the forward exchange market. In addition, we may wish to
test

if the sum of realized profits is significantly different from the

sum

predicted by the model. The test statistic for this hypothesis is —1.64. This
statistic lies within the critical values of the t-distribution at the ten percent significance level. We are

consequently

unable to reject the hypothesis

—20—

that

the difference between actual and expected profits is due to sampling

variation.

It is interesting to compare this test with the test used in Bilson [1981)
and ilodrick and Srivastava [1983).

In their tests, the individual values of

actual and expected profits are divided by the predicted standard deviation in
order to create a series of standardized actual
test if the mean of the distribution of actual

and expected profit. They then
standardized profits is signif-

average standardized expected profit.

The average standardized actual profit is .2732, and the standard deviation of

the average is .1622. The test statistic is computed to be 1.6841. Under the
null hypothesis that the true average standardized profit is zero, this
statistic

falls within the acceptance region of the t—distribution with 38
degrees of freedom. We are consequently unable to reject the null hypothesis.
We are also unable to reject the hypothesis that the true mean of the
distribution is equal to the average standardized expected profit.
The difference between the two tests again relates to the timing element

in the speculative strategy. The speculator is not as concerned with the
average value of the standardized profit variable as with the ability of the

standardized expected profit to predict the standardized actual profit. By
scaling up the portfolio when the expected profit is high, the speculator

changes the distribution of the outcomes. In the case that we have considered,
most of the profits were made in two of the 38 periods. This is the reason why

—21—

the total profits are significantly different fran zero while the average
standardized profits are not.8
In this section we have considered the speculative strategy as an isolated

activity. We found that while the strategy did not perform as well as it was
expected to do, the actual profits were still significantly different from

zero. The main defect with the evaluation of the strategy as an isolated activity is that the risk is measured by the variance of profits. When considered as a part of a wider portfolio, the risk should be measured in terms of
the contribution of the activity to the risk of the portfolio.

IV. THE MARKET RISK OF THE SPECULATIVE STRATEGY

In the previous section, the speculative strategy was evaluated as an Iso-

lated investment activity. In this section, we re—evaluate the strategy from
the perspective of an investor whose wealth is initially held in a diversified

equity portfolio. We represent the returnon this portfolio by the capital
appreciation of the S&P 500 index. while the index does not include dividends,
the return on this portfolio should be representative of the risk/return trade-

off front conventional U.S. equity portfolios. We shall also assume that the
expected capital appreciation of the S&P is equal to the Treasury risk—free

return Bill rate. Over the period from 1970 to 1981, Ibbotson and Sinquefield
(1982) report that the average capital appreciation of the s & p 500 index was

7.87 percent per annum. Over the same period, the average yield on U. S.

8The statistic reported in equation (15) can be written as
Z =

E (t/at)kt

N

where N represents the degrees of freedom. The test used by Bilson and
Hodrick and Srivastava sets kt equal to unity. The test described in

equation (15) sets kt equal to NUt/,iza. This weighting obviously gives a
larger influence to observation with larger positions.

—22—

Treasury

Bills was 7.43 percent. The main question that we will investigate is

the following: given the opportunity to divide a fixed initial stock of
capital between the S&P and the currency portfolio, what would be the Optimal
allocation between the two instruments?

Furthermore, what is the effect on the

risk and the return of the composite portfolio from the allocation of a
part of
the initial capital to currency speculation?
Since we are dealing with the allocation of capital between two investment
activities, we begin by restating the role of capital investment in the
currency

portfolio. In order to implement the

investor

requires capital in order to cover margin requirements and transac-

tions

speculative strategy, the

costs. Although forward contracts do not typically require explicit

margins,

a bank

may require that the investor maintain a security deposit in

to ensure against default. We assume that the deposit amount to 10
percent of the absolute value of the position taken and that the interest
earned on the deposit is equal to the Treasury Bill rate. Both of these
order

assumptions

are conservative. The largest loss incurred in the simulation was

less than 2 percent of the absolute value of the position, and margins on

exchange futures are

around 5 percent of the value of the
position. Furthermore, the deposit would typically be held in the form of a
foreign

typically

certificate of deposit. The yield on a certificate of deposit typically
exceeds

the yield on U.S. Treasury Bills. We define the investment as the

margin plus the transactions cost, and the revenue as the profit from the speculative activity, plus the interest on the margin, minus the transactions
costs.

For an investor whose initial wealth is solely in equities, the derivative
of the variance of end—of—period wealth with respect to a marginal allocation

of wealth to the currency portfolio is determined by the 'beta' of the currency

—23—

portfolio. Following standard practice, we first estimate the 'beta' by
regressing the returns from the currency portfolio on the return on the

S&P 500. After presenting these results, we shall discuss some problems that
arise with this approach in the present instance and present some alternative
formulations.

Estimation of the traditional market model led to the following results.
(16)

RC — TSR = .0235 ÷ .0390 (RP TSR] + u

In equation (16), IC =

return on the currency portfolio, TSR = the

Treasury Bill rate, K? = the return on the S&P 500, and u = the
residual.
Standard errors are presented in pirentheses beneath the coefficient esti-

mates. In interpreting these results, the first important point is that the
slope coefficient, which measures the market risk of the currency level of

market risk is small and not significantly different from zero. The low level
of market risk is also evidenced by the low value of the R2 statistic. In
fact, the adjusted K2 for the regression reported in equation (16) is nega-

tive. The low market risk of the currency portfolio is not surprising, since
the most common activity consists of spreads between the European currencies.
The second important point is the size and significance of the constant term.
In annual percentage terms, the constant term implies a return of 28.2 percent

per anntn above the Treasury Bill rate. the estimate is 1.9 standard devia-

tions from zero. While this value is not large enough to pass conventional
statistical tests, the probability that the true constant term is zero is less

than ten percent. The initial impression, then, is that the currency portfolio
offers

a substantial rate of return and an extremely low level of market risk.

—24-

There

are, however, a number of problems with the regression

equation (16). The first is that the residuals in the regression

reported in
are likely to

be heteroscedastic. We have already seen that the series of speculative
profits are very heteroscedastic because of the leveraging of the portfolio.
While some of this heteroscedasticity

may be eliminated by dividing the profits

by the investment, there is no necessary connection between the size of the

investment and the variance of profits. For example, if two currencies are
highly correlated, a spread position may imply a large margin, and hence a

large investment, but little risk. In order to account for this problem, we
reestimate the market model by weighted least squares. The weights are equal
to the ratio of the investment to the standard deviation

of profits, and the

standard deviations are computed from the alternative model of the variance of

profits introduced in the previous section. The revised estimates are
presented in equation (17).

RC — TBR

(.01175)

u

(.26294)

While the estimate of the market risk is still small and insignificant, the new
estimates result in an increase in the size and significance of the constant

term. The risk—adjusted return is now over 3 percent per month, or 40 percent
per annum, over the risk free rate, and it is possible to reject the hypothesis
that this coefficient is zero using standard significance tests.
The second problem with the traditional market model analysis is that the

expected

rate of return is assumed to be constant throughout the sample

period.

The econometric analysis demonstrated that the risk and return on the

currency portfolio is not constant, and it would be useful to take this finding
into account in the assessment of the market risk of the activity. We do this
by introducing the difference between the expected rate of

return on the

—25—

currency portfolio and the risk free rate as an additional

right hand side

variable.9 In this formulation, the risk adjusted return is allowed
to vary
throughout the sample period. As in the previous

estimation, weighted least

squares is employed to account for the heteroscedasticity in

the residuals.

The results are reported in equation (18).

(18)

RC — TSR = —.03273 + 1.1957[RE —
TBRJ + .300197(J.p — TSR] + u
(.03285) (.5568)
(.27036)

In this equation, RE =

the

expected return on the currency portfolio. This

series is created using the same procedures as were used to compute the actual

return. From this regression, we observe that the coefficient on the expected
return is significantly different from zero, but not significantly different
front unity. We consequently cannot reject the hypothesis that the model is

providing unbiased forecasts of actual returns. When the expected returns are
included in the regression, the estimate of the market risk of the activity is
increased, but it is still small and not significantly different from zero.
These results suggest that the currency portfolio would be a valuable

addition to a U.s. equity portfolio since the risk adjusted return is large and
statistically significant and since the incremental risk of the activity

appears to be small. We shall now explore this conjecture in

greater detail by

simulating the performance of a combined equity/currency portfolio. This
simulation is subject to the following limitations.

First, we do not allow the

composition of the currency portfolio to be influenced by the fact that it will

be combined with equities. In other words, our investor is envisaged to face
the decision of dividing beginning of period wealth between an equities fund

9Since we assume that the expected capital appreciation on the equity
portfolio is equal to the Treasury Bill rate, there is no need for an
additional term representing the difference between the expected equity return
and the risk free rate.

—26-.

and a currency fund. The fund managers do not take account of the activities
of other funds in selecting their own positions. Second, the investor assumed

that the

returns on the two funds are uncorrelated. This assumption can be

relaxed, but it is roughly consistent with the evidence, and it avoids

problems

associated with the use of ex post information. Although we shall use the
sample data to estimate the variance of equity returns, all other

information,

including the expected return and the expected variance of the currency portfolio, were available at the time that the investment decisions would have been

made. As was mentioned above, we approximate the expected capital appreciation
on the s&p portfolio by the Treasury Bill rate.
We describe the investor's optimization process in the following terms.
At the beginning of each period, the investor divides his capital between the

two funds. At the end of the period, the returns are realized and the new
stock of capital is re—allocated. The information set available to the
investor includes the expected return and the variance of the return on the
mean/variance utility function specified in (19).

(19)

U(E(R), V(R)1 = E(R) —

(1/(2A)Jv(R)

Since we are now dealing with the allocation of capital between two portfolios,

this utility function is specified to be a function of the expected rate of

return, E(R), and the expected variance, V(R), of the composite portfolio.

The risk aversion parameter, A, is set equal to .04 per month. This estimate

—27-.

is broadly consistent with the evidence on risk aversion by Friend and Blwrte
[19751

The expected return and expected variance are defined in equations (20)
and (21).

(20)

E(R) = wE(R1) + (1 — w)E(R2)

(21)

V(R) = w2V(R1) + (1 — w)2V(R2)

In these equations, Ri represents the return on the equity portfolio and
P2 represents the return on the currency portfolio. The investor sets the
share of equities in the portfolio, w, at the value that maximized expected
utility. In equation (21), the covariance between the returns is assumed to be
zero. The optimal value of the portfolio share is defined in equation (22).
w =

(22)

V(R2)/(v(R1)

+

V(R2)) + A(E(R1) — E(R2))/(v(R1) + V(R2))

The first term in this equation is the minimum variance allocation between the

two portfolios. The second term causes the actual share to deviate from the
minimum variance value as the expected returns on the two portfolios diverge..
As in the previous simulation, we have attempted to restrict the infor-

mation set available to the investor to information that was available at the

time that the decision would have been made. In particular, the expected
returns and the variance of the return on the currency portfolio are the prior

values from the simulation analysis. We have already demonstrated that these

10Friend and Blume use IRS data on asset holdings and conclude that the
behavior of investors can be described by the utility function U(W) =
where w represents wealth. Brown [1976] demonstrates that this function can
be approximated by a negative exponential utility function, U(R) = -exp(—R/A),
with A = .0416. Maximizing the utility function specified in equation (19) is
equivalent to maximizing a negative exponential utility function. See Jorian
[1983).

this excessive optimism will lead to an underestimate of the weight of equities

actual outcomes from the currency portfolio. These results do not imply,
however, that the investor would never allocate capital to the

currency port-

folio because the expected ratio of return to risk is not constant.

We will illustrate this point by repeating the portfolio allocation decision for a choice between a risk free asset bearing the Treasury Bill rate and

the currency portfolio. The simulation results are presented in Table 4. For
most of the periods, the investor holds between 60 percent to 100 percent of

capital in the form of Treasury Bills. However, there are five periods——
associated with large differences in nominal interest rates——when urn percent
of capital is allocated to the currency portfolio and there are a number of

other periods in which the currency share is substantial. These occasional

of capital to currency speculation substantially improved the
return on the portfolio. On an annualized basis, the pure Treasury Bill
portfolio had an average yield of 12.68 percent. The combined portfolio had an
allocations

average

yield of 25.35 percent per annum.

We conclude this section by examining the

various

end of period wealth from the

strategies. We assume an initial capital of $1000 and allow for re-

investment of returns in each period.

These values demonstrate that the currency portfolio had the largest average

rate of return over this sample period. An investor who had taken the
positions suggested by the currency
wealth

portfolio would have had

an end—of-period

which would be more than twice that yielded by the traditional

—31—

investment instruments. Furthermore, the low correlation between the currency
portfolio returns and the return on U.S. equities implies that the addition of
a currency portfolio to a U.S. equity portfolio will tend to diversify the risk

of that portfolio. Over the sample period, an investor who had divided capital
between the two portfolios in the way suggested by our analysis would have
obtained a substantially higher average rate of return in exchange for a
moderate increase in risk.

There

are a number of conclusions that can be drawn from this study.

First, there does appear to be a strong in—sample bias in tests of market

efficiency in the foreign exchange market. In particular, we find that standard regression procedures tend to underestimate the variance and overestimate

the mean of trading profits. As a consequence, speculators are likely to be
disappointed if they follow the rules outlined in this and other papers on
trading strategy.

On the other hand, the strategy was profitable despite the allowances made

for transactions costs and margin requirements. Most of the profits were made
in a small number of instances when interest rate differentials were large.

Since these periods correspond to situations of unstable international monetary
arrangements, the profits could be associated with central bank intervention
(Taylor [1982]) or with a peso problem (Krasker [1980]) in which a small

probability adverse outcome has not occured in the sample. It should be
noticed, however, that the realization of the major part of profits in a small
number of

periods is a consequence of the trading strategy, rather than being a

consequence of unanticipated outcomes.

In the final section of the paper, composite portfolios of equities and
currencies, and equities and Treasury Bills, were considered. Although the
share

of currencies in the composite portfolio was typically small, it is

probabily greater than existing investments by pension fund managers in forward

contracts. Furthermore, there were a number of periods in which the allocation
of capital to currency speculation was large, and these investments did

substantially improve the risk/return characteristic of the portfolio. It is
consequently unlikely that the failure of investment managers to engage in
currency speculation is due to risk aversion.
