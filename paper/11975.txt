Health Insurance and the Wage Gap

ABSTRACT

Estimates of labor market inequality usually focus only on wages, even though fringes account for
almost one-third of total compensation. Using data from the Current Population Survey, I analyze
coverage by own-employer health insurance coverage among full-time workers for women versus
men, blacks versus whites and Hispanics versus whites. I find significant gaps in coverage for each
of these groups. About two-thirds of the gap for blacks or Hispanics is explained by differences in
observable characteristics (primarily education and occupation). The gap for women is not explained
by controlling for observables. Looking over the 20 year period from 1980 to 2000, I find that the
adjusted gap in own-employer coverage for women has been relatively flat over this period and is
consistently much smaller than the male/female wage gap (about half as large), so that measuring
inequality in wages plus health insurance would result in a smaller estimate of male/female
compensation inequality than measuring wages alone. The same is generally true for blacks although
their health insurance gap is much closer in magnitude to their wage gap. For Hispanics, the health
insurance gap is nearly identical to the wage gap and both are increasing over time.

1. Introduction
Women and racial or ethnic minorities have consistently lower wages than do white men.
The male/female wage gap, the black/white wage gap, and the Hispanic/white wage gap have
been the subject of much research (for a review, see Altonji and Blank 1999). Nearly all of this
research, however, omits the potential contribution of fringe benefits to these gaps, even though
fringes are almost one third of total compensation (U.S. Department of Labor 2004).
Compensation inequality may be larger or smaller than wage inequality, depending on how the
distribution of fringes compares to the distribution of wages.
A number of recent papers have analyzed gender, racial or ethnic differentials in health
insurance coverage. In this paper, I build on earlier work in five ways. First, I look at all three
types of gaps (male/female, black/white and Hispanic/white) among workers using a consistent
data source and methods. Second, I apply two types of decomposition analysis to each gap. The
first is a simple analysis of whether gaps in coverage are due to gaps in offering, gaps in
eligibility, or gaps in takeup; the second is a Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition that breaks down the
raw gaps in coverage, offering, eligibility and takeup into portions explained by differences in
observable factors (like education and industry) and unexplained portions. Third, I look at gaps
in coverage from other sources, to see whether these offset or exacerbate gaps in own-employer
health insurance coverage. Fourth, I analyze how gaps in coverage have changed from 1980
through 2000, a longer time period than has been analyzed in other studies. Finally, I compare
the estimated health insurance gaps to wage gaps for the same groups, and consider how an
estimate of the “compensation gap” that included the prevalence of health insurance would
compare to estimated wage gaps.

1

I find significant gaps in coverage for each of these groups. The gaps for blacks and
Hispanics relative to whites are driven by lower rates of employer offering, while the
female/male gap is driven by lower rates of takeup among women who are eligible for coverage.
About two-thirds of the gap for blacks or Hispanics is explained by differences in observable
characteristics (primarily education and occupation). The gap for women is not explained by
controlling for observables; but for women, coverage from other sources – primarily employersponsored coverage as a dependent rather than as a policyholder – more than makes up for their
lower rates of own-employer coverage, so that overall female workers are less likely to be
uninsured than male workers. The same is not true for blacks and Hispanics: their rates of
coverage from other sources are also lower than rates for whites, so that they are significantly
more likely to be uninsured even after adjusting for observables.
Looking over the 20 year period from 1980 to 2000, I find that the adjusted gap in ownemployer coverage for women has been relatively flat over this period and is consistently much
smaller than the male/female wage gap (about half as large), so that measuring inequality in
wages plus health insurance would result in a smaller estimate of male/female compensation
inequality than measuring wages alone. The same is generally true for blacks although their
health insurance gap is much closer in magnitude to their wage gap. For Hispanics, the health
insurance gap is nearly identical to the wage gap and both are increasing over time. Thus, I find
no evidence that adding health insurance to estimates of labor market compensation inequality
would widen disparities for women versus men, blacks versus whites, or Hispanics versus
whites.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews the existing literature on gender, racial
and ethnic disparities in wages, health insurance, and other fringe benefits. Section 3 discusses

2

the data used in the analysis and section 4 presents the methods of analysis. Section 5 presents
results. Section 6 discusses directions for future research, and concludes.

2. Background and review of existing literature
Few authors have considered the potential contribution of fringe benefits to labor market
inequality. Solberg and Loughlin (1995) use data from the NLSY-1991 on fringe benefits
among young workers (ages 26 to 34) including health and life insurance, paid vacation, dental
insurance, training/education subsidies, profit sharing, maternity/paternity leave, flexible hours,
employer-subsidized child care and retirement benefits. For this subpopulation, using an index
of the value of compensation rather than just wages reduces the overall male/female gap from 16
percent to 11 percent, but that the male/female gap remains significant. Race and ethnicity gaps
in total compensation were insignificant after controlling for other characteristics. Pierce (2001)
and Chung (2003) both find using different data sets that the dispersion of total compensation
(measured as the difference between percentiles of the compensation distribution [e.g. the 90th
versus the 10th] rather than differences across demographic groups) exceeds the dispersion of
wages, and that compensation inequality has grown more in recent years than has wage
inequality.
A related literature considers how the inclusion of non-pecuniary job characteristics other
than fringe benefits – for example, the risk of a workplace injury – affects male/female wage
gaps.

Filer (1985) uses data from 1977 and concludes that the inclusion of nonwage

characteristics that might be expected to create a compensating wage differential (e.g. does a job
offer variety; is the worker exposed to physical hazards) increase the fraction of the male/female

3

wage gap that is unexplained by about a third. Schuman, Ahlburg and Mahoney (1994) reach a
similar conclusion.
In addition to papers that explicitly consider the potential contribution of fringes to
compensation inequality, a number of authors have examined disparities in fringe benefits for
their own sake. Even and Macpherson (1994) analyze the gender gap in pensions and find that
about two-thirds of the gap is explained by differences in observable worker characteristics.
Buchmueller (1996/97), using the Employee Benefits Supplement to the April 1993 CPS, finds
that women have lower rates than men of health insurance coverage from their own employers,
and that this difference is driven primarily by lower takeup of insurance among married women.
Monheit and Vistnes (2000) analyze changes in insurance coverage by race, ethnicity and gender
using the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey and the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel
Study. They find that for most groups, declines between 1987 and 1996 are not explained by
changes in observable variables; for Hispanic men, however, 5.2 of the 13 percentage point
decline is explained. They also analyze the reasons for the static gap between Hispanic and white
men in 1996 and find that the majority of it (17.7 of 29.1 percentage points) is explained by
differences in observable characteristics – primarily wages, family income, and education.
LoSasso et al. (2004) analyze the gap in health insurance between immigrants and nonimmigrants using the Employee Benefits Supplement to the April 1993 CPS. They find a large
gap that is driven by low rates of coverage among noncitizen immigrants; the gap is primarily
attributable to low rates of health insurance offering among immigrants, and two-thirds of it is
explained by observable characteristics. Dushi and Honig (2005) use the 1996 Survey of Income
and Program Participation to analyze differences in coverage by race and ethnicity; they find that
minorities have significantly lower rates of insurance coverage and that, in particular, Hispanics

4

are less likely than non-Hispanic whites to be offered employer-sponsored insurance. All of
these results confirm the existence of between-group gaps in health insurance which may make
compensation gaps larger or smaller than wage gaps for the same groups, depending on the
relative size of the health insurance and wage gaps.

3. Data
The data for the project come from two different supplements to the Current Population
Survey: the February Contingent and Alternative Employment Arrangement Supplements in
1995, 1997, 1999 and 2001 and the March Annual Demographic Files for 1981 – 2001.
The Current Population Survey Contingent and Alternative Employment Arrangement
Supplements (February 1995, 1997, 1999 and 2001)
The Contingent Work Supplements ask a subsample of workers in the February CPS
detailed questions about their employment, including whether they are covered by employersponsored health insurance from their own employer. If workers are not covered by their own
employer they are asked whether the employer offers coverage to any workers; whether they
were eligible for such coverage; and whether they have coverage from another source, such as a
family member’s employer-sponsored policy or a public program. The supplements also include
information on industry and occupation, job tenure, hours of work, and basic demographic
characteristics such as race, ethnicity and education. For data from 1995, 1997 and 1999, I can
construct a measure of hourly wages using responses to the questions asked of the Outgoing
Rotation Groups in the basic survey.1 These questions refer to the current job; workers are asked
if they are paid hourly and if so, they report an hourly wage. All workers are then asked about
1

In 1995, 1997 and 1999, the Contingent Work Supplements were administered to workers in all rotation groups,
but in 2001 it was administered only to rotation groups other than 4 and 8 (so that in 2001 there is no one from the
outgoing rotation groups in the Contingent Work Supplement).

their usual weekly earnings and usual weekly hours; I use responses to these questions to
construct usual average hourly earnings for non-hourly workers. I restrict the sample to full-time
workers (35 hours/week or more) in the private sector.
The March Annual Demographic File
In March, the Current Population Survey supplements the basic questionnaire with
questions about income, work and health insurance in the previous calendar year. I use these
supplements from 1981 to 2001 to look at health insurance and earnings for full-time, full-year
workers. The health insurance questions in March are about health insurance coverage from a
variety of sources, including employer-sponsored coverage; no questions are asked about
whether an uninsured worker’s employer offers insurance, however. My measure of the wage for
this sample is wage and salary earnings from a worker’s main job in the previous calendar year
divided by the product of weeks worked last year and usual hours per week. I restrict the sample
to full-year, full-time workers (35 hours/week or more) in the private sector.2
In all cases, wages are inflated to real 2000 dollars using the Consumer Price Index for all
urban consumers (BLS series CUUR0000SA0 for recent data and MUUR0000SA0 for older
data).
4. Methods
I analyze gaps in coverage using two different types of statistical decomposition. The
first decomposition breaks down the gap in health insurance coverage between two groups into
components attributable to offering, eligibility, and coverage. Following the analysis in Farber
and Levy (2000), note that the rate of own-employer coverage for group i (women, for example)

2

The full-year restriction is necessary because my measure of average hourly earnings is unreliable for workers who
did not work a full year. The full-year restriction is not imposed in the February data since the February questions
refer to a worker’s current job, rather than main job last year.

6

is the product of the offer rate, the eligibility rate conditional on offering, and the enrollment rate
conditional on eligibility (“takeup”):
Covi = Oi ⋅ Ei ⋅ Ti

i = 1, 2

(1)

The difference in the coverage rate between groups 1 and 2 is therefore:

Cov 2 − Cov1 = (O2 − O1 ) ⋅ E 2 ⋅ T2 + (E 2 − E1 ) ⋅ O2 ⋅ T2 + (T2 − T1 ) ⋅ O2 ⋅ E 2 + covariance term (2)
Or, in more compact notation, using

to denote the difference between group 2 and group 1:

∆C = ∆O ⋅ E ⋅ T + ∆E ⋅ O ⋅ T + ∆T ⋅ O ⋅ E + covariance term

(3)

The three terms on the right hand side are the percentage point differences in the coverage rate
due to differences in the offering rate, the eligibility rate, and the takeup rate, respectively.3 I
perform this decomposition separately for women versus men, Blacks versus Whites, and
Hispanics versus Whites.
I also apply standard Blinder-Oaxaca decompositions to gaps in wages and different
types of insurance coverage in order to determine how much of the raw gap can be explained by
observable characteristics (see Oaxaca and Ransom, 1999, for an explanation of this approach).
To determine whether considering health insurance in addition to wages would yield
compensation gaps that are greater than wage gaps, I begin by considering the potential
consequences of omitting health insurance from a calculation of compensation inequality across
groups.4 For simplicity, I assume that compensation has only two components, wages and health
insurance, and that there are again two groups of workers, type 1 and type 2.

Average

compensation for type 2 workers is defined as:

The covariance term is ∆O ⋅ ∆E ⋅ T ⋅ + ∆O ⋅ E ⋅ ∆T ⋅ +O ⋅ ∆E ⋅ ∆T ⋅ + ∆O ⋅ ∆T ⋅ ∆T , where an unsubscripted
term represents the mean for group 2. In practice, the covariance term is negligible and is not presented in the
analysis.
4
This discussion is adapted from Pierce (2001) who considers the case where information is available on the total
cost of nonwage benefits. I have modified his framework to consider a single discrete benefit (health insurance).

C 2 = W2 + HI 2 ⋅ Π

(4)

Where W2 is the average wage, HI2 is the fraction of the group that has health insurance and

is

the cost of health insurance per covered worker (assumed to be the same for type 1 and type 2
workers).
In order to derive an expression relating the compensation gap between type 1 and type 2
workers, divide expression (4) by C1:
C 2 W2 H 2 ⋅ Π
=
+
C1 C1
C1

(5)

Manipulation of the right-hand side yields:
C 2 W2 W1 H 2 ⋅ Π H 1 ⋅ Π
=
⋅
+
⋅
C1 W1 C1 H 1 ⋅ Π
C1

(6)

This expression reduces to:
∆C = (1 − S1 ) ⋅ ∆W + S1 ⋅ ∆HI

where the operator

(7)

represents the gap between groups 1 and 2 and S1 is the share of group 1’s

compensation that is devoted to health insurance.
The interpretation of this expression is that the compensation gap is the weighted sum of
the wage gap and the health insurance gap.5 Therefore, if the health insurance gap is the same as
the wage gap, considering only wage gaps and not health insurance gaps does not bias the
estimate of the compensation gap. On the other hand, if the proportional gap in health insurance
is larger than the gap in wages, omitting health insurance biases the estimate of group one’s

5

This expression generalizes to additional fringe benefits. Suppose there are j = 1, …, J fringes. The compensation
gap is the weighted sum of the wage gap and the individual benefit gaps, weighted by each of their shares in
compensation:

∆C = 1 −

S j ⋅ ∆W +

compensation premium toward zero. If the health insurance gap is smaller than the wage gap,
the reverse is true and omitting insurance overstates the between-group differential.
The relevant question, then, for determining the implications of omitting health insurance
from the measured compensation gap is whether the proportional health insurance gap is larger
or smaller than the proportional wage gap.

5. Results
A. Basic Decomposition Results

Table 1 presents descriptive statistics on health insurance and other characteristics of fulltime, full-year workers in the February CPS supplements. On average, 71.6 percent of these
workers have health insurance coverage from their own employer. The coverage rate is higher
for men than for women (74.1 percent versus 68.0 percent) and for whites than for blacks or
Hispanics (74.1 percent versus 70.1 percent and 55.8 percent, respectively). Thus there is a six
percentage point male/female coverage gap, a four percentage point black/white gap and an 8
percentage point Hispanic/white gap.
The fraction of workers offered health insurance is between 85 and 89 percent for all
groups except Hispanics, only 69.9 percent of whom work for employers offering insurance.
Eligibility rates are high for all groups; 95 to 96 percent of any group of workers in a firm where
health insurance is offered are eligible for coverage. (This fraction would be lower if the sample
included part-time workers.) Takeup among eligible workers is 86.2 percent on average, with
men having the highest rate (89.1 percent) and women the lowest (82.0 percent); by race and
ethnicity, whites have the highest rate (86.5 percent), followed by blacks (85.7 percent) and
Hispanics (84.2 percent).

9

Applying the statistical decomposition described above in equation (3) shows that the
male/female gap in coverage is almost entirely explained by the gap in takeup; these results are
presented in table 2. Indeed, since women have slightly higher rates of offering and nearly
identical eligibility rates, this is not surprising. The results are quite different for racial and
ethnic gaps, however. Three-quarters of the black/white gap (3 of 4 percentage points) is
explained by lower offer rates for blacks, with smaller contributions from lower eligibility and
takeup rates for blacks explaining the rest. The results are similar for Hispanics; 16 percentage
points of the 18.3 percentage point coverage gap relative to Whites are explained by lower
offering rates. The story that emerges from this part of the analysis, then, is quite clear: the
male/female coverage gap is explained by women’s lower takeup, while Black and Hispanic
gaps relative to Whites are due to lower offer rates for minorities.
The next question is how much of these gaps can be explained by observable individual
and job characteristics. Table 1 shows that on average, blacks and Hispanics have lower levels
of education than whites, which will likely account for some of the observed differences in offer
rates. Not surprisingly, Hispanics are much more likely to be non-citizens or naturalized citizens;
fewer than half of Hispanics are native-born citizens, compared with 96.5 percent of whites or
91.4 percent of blacks. Another important way in which blacks and Hispanics differ from whites
is that they have lower average tenure on the job by a year or two, and are a couple of percentage
points more likely to have been on the job for less than a year. Women, also, have on average
1.2 fewer years on the job than men. For other characteristics that may determine health
insurance coverage, however, it is not clear that women are at a disadvantage. For example,
women have a more compressed distribution of education than do men, with fewer women being
high school dropouts or college graduates, and they are slightly more likely to be native citizens.

10

As a result it is not clear a priori how much controlling for education or citizenship will affect
male/female gaps. Table 3 presents the results of five separate regressions corresponding to
different dependent variables: own employer health insurance coverage, offering, eligibility,
takeup, and ln(wages).6 Independent variables include race, ethnicity and gender dummies; a
marital status dummy and its interaction with the female dummy; age and age squared; a set of
dummies for job tenure (the omitted category is tenure less than three months); a set of dummies
for education (the omitted category is less than high school); and dummies for citizenship (the
omitted category is a native-born citizen). The regressions also include 12 occupation dummies,
12 industry dummies, state dummies and year dummies, although these coefficients are not
reported in table 3. These regressions show that gender, race and ethnicity gaps may or may not
be significant once other factors have been controlled for. All of the male/female gaps are
significant.7 Black/white and Hispanic/white gaps, in some cases, are not significant. In
particular, while coverage and wage gaps are significant in the regression for both groups,
offering gaps for blacks relative to whites are not significant and takeup gaps for Hispanics
relative to whites are not significant. Eligibility gaps are not significant for either group.
Table 4 presents the results of a set of Blinder-Oaxaca decompositions for the same five
outcomes and for three comparisons: male/female, black/white and Hispanic/white. The first
panel shows the male/female decompositions.

None of the male/female coverage gap is

explained by observable characteristics. In fact, women’s observable characteristics suggest that
6

The sample size for the wage regression is 19,913 or about 1/5 of the sample size for the coverage regression since
as noted above wages are available only for a subsample of observations in 1995, 1997 and 1999, and not at all in
2001.
7
Following Buchmueller (1996/97), I include the interaction term married*female, which separates the male/female
gap into a gap for single women and a gap for married women. All gaps are significant for both groups except for
the eligibility gap and the takeup gap for single women; however, in the case of coverage and offering, the gaps for
single and married women have opposite signs (and are both significant). These results are consistent with
Buchmueller’s. If the interaction term is omitted, the coefficient on the female dummy is approximately the average
of the two coefficients reported in table 3 (since as seen in table 1 about half of the sample is female), and all are
significantly different from zero.

11

their coverage and offering rates should be higher than they are (hence the negative signs on the
explained portions of the gaps for those two outcomes). About one percentage point of the seven
percentage point gap in takeup can be explained by occupation and tenure. In contrast, about one
fifth of the male/female wage gap (4.6 percentage points of a 22.4 percent gap) can be explained
by the decomposition.
In contrast to the results for women, observable characteristics do a very good job of
explaining health insurance gaps for blacks and Hispanics compared to whites. Almost three
percentage points of the four percentage point coverage gap for blacks are explained by
observables: primarily tenure, education, and occupation. For Hispanics, almost two-thirds of
the gap in coverage is explained (11.8 of 18.3 percentage points); the main culprits are tenure,
education, industry and occupation. Table 5 summarizes the results of both types of
decomposition side-by-side, to convey the main reasons for differences in coverage and how
much can be explained by observables.

B. What about other sources of coverage?

Table 6 shows other sources of coverage for different groups. Thanks primarily to
coverage as dependents, women actually have higher overall rates of coverage than men. For
blacks and Hispanics, however, their lower rates of own-employer coverage are exacerbated by
lower rates of coverage from other sources, so that overall blacks are almost twice as likely as
whites to be uninsured (18.6 percent versus 10.6 percent), while Hispanics are more than three
times as likely to be uninsured (34.8 percent). Thus, while women’s low takeup may in some
sense be “explained” by the availability of other coverage, for blacks and Hispanics lower rates
of own-employer coverage translate into higher rates of uninsurance.

12

C. Comparing health insurance gaps to wage gaps over time

Concern about the uninsured is only one reason for being interested in gaps in employersponsored health insurance. Another is the desire to measure correctly between-group
differentials in employee compensation and to understand the contribution of nonwage
compensation to these differentials over time. Figure 1 plots real wages for men, women, all
whites, all blacks, and all Hispanics from 1980 to 2000 based on the March CPS data. Figure 2
plots the fraction of each group of full-time, full-year workers who have their own health
insurance. Figure 2 reflects the well-documented gradual decline of own-employer coverage
over this period.8
Recall from section 3 that the relevant question for determining the implications of
omitting health insurance from the measured compensation gap is whether the proportional
health insurance gap is larger or smaller than the proportional wage gap. Figure 3 plots the
health insurance and wage gaps for male and female full-time, full year-workers in each year
from 1980 to 2000, calculated using the March CPS. Two set of gaps are presented for each
group: unadjusted gaps (the percent difference in health insurance or wages) and adjusted gaps
based on a regression controlling for a simple set of human capital characteristics (female, black
and Hispanic indicator variables; a dummy for married; a set of dummies for education, industry,
and state of residence) estimated separately in each year. The adjusted gap is the ratio of
predicted health insurance if the entire sample were male compared with it if were female, minus
one.
Several things are evident in Figure 3. First, the wage gap is always larger than the
health insurance gap. Omitting this fringe benefit, at least, leads to an overstatement in the labor
8

Appendix tables A1 – A5 contain the data on which the figures are based.

13

market inequality between men and women. Second, the fraction of the wage gap that can be
explained declines steadily until about 1993, when it becomes stable. Third, only in 1980 and
1981 can even a small fraction of the male/female health insurance gap be explained by
observable factors. Our inability to understand the male/female coverage gap is a longstanding
phenomenon.
Figure 4 presents a comparable analysis for black/white wage and health insurance gaps.
The adjusted health insurance gap in any year is between 0 and 10 percentage points smaller than
the same year’s wage gap. Whites’ wages are about 14 – 18 percent higher than blacks; but
whites are only 3 – 14 percent more likely than blacks to have health insurance. Thus, as was the
case for women, omitting health insurance and focusing only on wages overstates black/white
labor market inequality. Wage and health insurance gaps for Hispanics, in contrast, have been
nearly identical to each other since the late 1980s (figure 5). This suggests that omitting health
insurance does not bias estimates of Hispanic/white labor market inequality. Another interesting
result in figure 5 is that the adjusted Hispanic/white gap in health insurance has increased
steadily, from 6.6 percent in 1980 to 19.5 percent in 2000. The adjusted Hispanic/white wage
gap increased over the same period from 15 percent to 19 percent.

6. Discussion

This study has a number of limitations. First, there is a long list of additional variables
that should be included in the wage regressions. As noted above, job characteristics such as
physical hazards have been shown to affect measured wage gaps. To give just a few other
examples, actual labor market experience (Blau and Kahn 1997), the quality and/or content of
education rather than just degree completed (Card and Krueger 1992; Brown and Corcoran

14

1997), and aptitude test scores (Neal and Johnson 1996) have all been shown to matter for race
and/or gender gaps.
An omitted variable that may be particularly important in this context is employer size,
which is known to affect both wages and health insurance offering (see Brown and Medoff 1989
for evidence on the employer size wage effect and Monheit and Vistnes 1999 for evidence on
how firm size affects health insurance). While there is no information on employer size in the
February Contingent Work Supplements, establishment size is available in the March CPS
supplement since 1989. Analysis of these data, presented in table 7, suggests that the distribution
of establishment size is similar for men and women, so that controlling for establishment size
would do little to explain the male/female coverage gap. Blacks, on the other hand, tend to work
in larger establishments than whites, so that controlling for establishment size in the black/white
analysis would actually make the gap in offering less easily explained. Finally, Hispanics do
tend to work in smaller establishments than Whites, so that omitting establishment size from the
Hispanic/white decomposition omits a potentially important explainer of the gaps in coverage
and offering. Analysis using the March survey data, however, suggests that in practice
establishment size explains a negligible amount of the Hispanic/white gap in coverage (results
not shown).
Another obvious limitation of this study is that I have not considered other fringe
benefits. Fringes accounted for 28.6 percent of private sector compensation in 2004; health
insurance was only 6.6 percent of the total, or about a quarter of all fringes (U.S. Department of
Labor 2004). Other fringes – paid vacations, pensions, legally required benefits, etc. – therefore

15

made up 22.0 percent of compensation, or more than three times as much as health insurance.9 If
gaps in other fringes are sufficiently large, then, including them in the compensation gap might
more than offset the narrowing effect of including health insurance, and the overall
compensation gap might in fact be larger than the wage gap after all. To be more precise: if the
gap between other fringes and wages is at least one-third as large in absolute value as the gap
between wages and health insurance, including other fringes in the calculation will yield an
estimate of compensation inequality larger than measured wage inequality, in spite of the
offsetting effect of health insurance.
Finally, one limitation to bear in mind is that the analysis includes only full-time workers
(and in the analysis of March data, only full-time, full-year workers). Including part-time
workers in the analysis would lower average rates of health insurance; how it would affect gaps
in wages or health insurance between groups is unclear. Moreoever, the analysis is not one of
race, ethnicity or gender gaps in insurance coverage in the population as a whole. The
differential probabilities of working across groups would certainly yield a different result from
that yielded by this analysis of workers only.

7. Conclusion

I find that gaps in own-employer health insurance coverage between male and female
full-time workers are largely due to differences in takeup among eligible workers and that these
differences are mostly unexplained by differences in men’s and women’s observable
characteristics. However, these differences do not translate into higher rates of uninsurance
among female workers because of coverage from other sources (primarily group coverage as a
9

Subtracting legally required benefits (8.7 percent of total compensation) means that health insurance represents
about a third of non-required benefits (6.6/19.9). To the extent that legally required benefits are proportional to
wages, they contribute nothing to any difference between the compensation gap and the wage gap.

16

dependent). Moreover, these gaps are smaller than wage gaps and would therefore reduce
male/female compensation inequality compared to inequality measured using wages alone.
For blacks and Hispanics, the story is quite different. Gaps in own-employer coverage
for both groups, relative to whites, are due to lower offering rates among minority workers, and a
substantial fraction of the gap in each case is explained by differences in observable
characteristics like education and occupation. Because minority workers are also less likely than
whites to have insurance coverage from other sources, these gaps translate into higher rates of
uninsurance for black and Hispanic workers. As was the case for women, health insurance gaps
for blacks relative to whites are smaller than wage gaps, so that the black/white wage gap
overstates the black/white compensation gap measured using wages plus health insurance. For
Hispanics, the health insurance gap and the wage gap are very similar in size, so that
Hispanic/white compensation inequality may in fact be very similar to Hispanic/white wage
inequality.
These results should prompt different reactions from labor economists and health policy
analysts. Labor economists may be more interested in the failure of observable characteristics to
explain the gender gap in health insurance, which parallels their failure to explain the gender gap
in wages and deepens the mystery of why men and women appear to be so differently
compensated in the labor market. The result that health insurance gaps narrow the compensation
gap (compared to the wage gap) for women, blacks and Hispanics should encourage further
consideration among labor economists of what role other fringe benefits might play, in order to
be able to say definitely whether compensation gaps are larger or smaller than wage gaps.
Health policy analysts, on the other hand, may be more interested in the result that for Hispanics
and blacks, gaps in employer coverage exacerbate gaps in other kinds of coverage and contribute

17

to higher rates of uninsurance for these groups. The fact that a substantial fraction of these gaps
can be explained by observable characteristics also suggests policy “levers” that might lead to
higher rates of insurance coverage for these currently disadvantaged groups.
