A Technique for Indicating Comparative Costs
and Predicting Changes in Trade Ratios

ABSTRACT

This paper estimates relative differences in factor prices (and thus
industry comparative cost differences) between the United States and each
of eight country groups by relating differences in factor—use requirement

and actual bilateral export/import ratios across industries. Predictions
concerning changes in industry export/import ratios are also made (and
tested against actual subsequent changes) by comparing these trade ratios
with those expected on the basis of the estimated average differences in
factor costs and assuming that adjustment lags are the major reason for

the differences between these ratios.

In

Introduction

determining industries of unusual strength or weakness in inter-

national competitive terms, past practice has been to look at actual trade

performance. However, in a world characterized by market imperfections,
this approach can be misleading, especially in the short run. The method
suggested here tries to improve upon the standard revealed—comparative--cost

approach by using estimated relative factor price differences between two
countries to calculate relative cost differences between the countries for

the products of each industry. A country is revealed to be highly competitive
in its trade with another country for the products of a particular industry
if its estimated production costs are significantly below those of the
other country.

Future "winners" and "losers" can also be predicted in the sense that
an industry's future export growth rate is expected to be either higher or

lower than the growth rate of its imports. The procedure for this purpose is
to compare an industry's ratio of exports to imports that is predicted on the
basis of the estimated unit cost difference for a particular year with the

actual export/import ratio for the industry in that year. Sectors where the
actual ratio is much lower than the predicted trade ratio should, if adjustment lags are an important cause of such differences, exhibit a rise in this

ratio over time. The opposite should occur when the actual ratio is above
the predicted one.

2

II. An Outline of the Technique

A. Production Costs, Factor Prices and Trade Flows
Although variations among countries in relative factor endowments,
states of technology and tastes shape the direction and composition of
international trade, the immediate cause of commodity flows across national
borders is differences among countries in the costs of producing tradable

goods. In a two—country rld, if one country can produce a particular
standardized item more cheaply than the other and the transportation
cost is less than the production cost difference, the first country will
export the item to the second country.
Considerations that make the framework more realistic complicate the

relationships but the basic point about cost differences remains. For
example, in most manufacturing industries each firm produces goods that are
similar.but not identical to those provided by other domestic or foreign

firms in the sector. One consequence of this is that two—way trade may take
place in the same industry between countries. However, differences in production costs would still play an important part in determining the size of the
ratio of exports to imports in each commodity category.
The existence of more than two countries also complicates the situation.
The ability of (say) country A to produce and ship an item to country B at a

cost below that at which B can produce the good is only a necessary (and not
sufficient) condition for trade. This is because some third country (C)
may be able to deliver the product in country B at an even lower cost than

country A can. However, given the existence of differentiated products,
one would still expect some net exports of the item from country A to B

3

and the difference in production costs to be an important determinant of
the size of exports compared to imports.

If countries share a common linearly homogeneous technology, differ-

ences in their unit costs of producing various goods depend solely upon the

differences among the countries in the prices of the factor inputs. For n
commodities, m factors and two ëountries, A and B, the relationship between
the unit costs of producing the same good with the same technology in A and

B and the differences between A and B in factor prices can be expressed as
follows:

m
(1)

UC. =

E

i=l

O..w.1 ,
J

where UC. stands for the relative difference for the unit cost of the •th

good, Oi. is the 1th factor's share of unit costs of the th good, and w•
is the relative difference in the return to the th factor between A and B.1
Let UC. be positive if the unit cost is greater in B than in A and let w1 be

positive if the return to the th factor is greater in B than in A.

B. Estimating Factor Price Differences
Since factor shares can be obtained from published data fairly readily,

it is possible to determine relative unit cost differences between two
countries, provided factor prices (or their differences) can be ascertained

for the two countries. While the determination of factor price differences
by direct observation might seem to be a relatively simple exercise, obtaining
data that accurately represent the cost of a particular factor is, in fact,

a difficult task. For example, only the advanced industrial countries
systematically collect earnings data for various types of labor. Even when
earnings data are available, intercountry differences in classification

4

systems and in fringe benefits received by factors that are often unknown

to the investigator cause serious measurement problems. Ascertaining
differences in capital costs and retital returns to land and natural

resources also is very difficult.2

Another quite different approach developed by Hiaton (1981) is to
estimate bilateral differences in factor prices on the basis of observable

trade patterns. If country A exports a particular product to country B,
this implies that the relative difference in unit costs between B and A, UC.,,
is positive. If A imports the item,UC. is negative,.

In a world of identical goods and production functions together with
perfect knowledge, the relationships between the direction of trade, relative
unit cost differences, and the weighted average of factor shares (where the
weights are relative differences in factor prices) are completely deter-

ministic and therefore not suitable for estimation. Furthermore, all
commodity trade would be unidirectional. However, aggregation of product
data within a particular industry as well as differentiated products will
lead to two—way trade in most of the sectors identified under standard

classification systems. Furthermore, imperfect factor and product markets,
adjustment lags, relative differences in the state of technology between two
countries, etc. can cause the weighted average of factor shares only to
approximate relative differences in unit costs and can affect net trade

flows. If one assumes that the various conditions preventing an exact
relationship between factor prices and unit costs on the one hand and unit
costs and net trade flows on the other are randomly distributed, an estimable

model can be derived.3

5

Assuming the greater the relative cost advantage of one country over
another in any product group the higher the ratio of exports of these

products from the first country to imports from the second country, the
following relationships are posited:
(2)

ln(X./M.) =

(3)

ln(X,/M.) =

l

+

•UC. + e.

+

•

O.w.

+ e.

where X. is the value of export: from country A to B in the th product
class, M. is the value of imports into A from B in this product class,

and 2 are constant terms, and e. is a normally distributed random
component. From a knowledge of factor shares, that is, the Us, and actual
trade flows between two countries in every industry, one can obtain

estimates of the rank order of relative factor price differences between
the two countries.4

III. Analyzing U.S. Bilateral Trade Flows

In implementing the model empirically the industry breakdown used is
that

of

the 367 sectors of the 1972 U.S. input/output table published by

the Department of Commerce. Excluding nontraded—goods industries and
aggregating industries in agriculture and mining to a 2—digit (rather than

4—digit) basis yield: 296 separate industries. Trade between the United
States and each of eight countries or regional groups (as well as an "all

country" group) was analyzed for each of these industries. The countries
or regions are:

(1) Canada; (2) the United Kingdom; (3) France; (4) Germany;

(5) Italy; (6) South Asia (India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh);

(7) East Asia (South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong); and (8) Japan. The value

6

of each U.S. industry's output was divided into the following five factor
shares:

(1) unskilled labor; (2) skilled labor; (3) physical capital;

(4) land; and (5) natural resources.5

The return to U.S. unskilled labor is measured as the 1972 average
annual income of a full—time worker with less than eight years of education.

Multiplying this return by the total number of employees in each industry
and dividing by the total value of industry output yields the share of

output representing compensation to unskilled labor. The factor shares for
skilled labor were calculated as the difference between the published

industry factor shares for all labor and the calculated shares for unskilled

labor. The output shares received by capital, land, and natural resources
were estimated by subdividing the property income share, as reported in
the input—output table, according to capital—stock, land, and natural

resource information based on various reports from the Commerce, Agriculture

and Interior.Departments. Finally, trade data for each industry and
country group was obtained by reclassifying exports and imports as reported
by the Commerce Department first to a 4—digit SIC basis and then into the
4—digit I/O industrial breakdown.

The estimated coefficients reported in Table 1 for the two labor
groups, physical capital, land and natural resources indicate the comparative magnitudes of differences in relative factor prices between the United

States and each of the eight country groups.6 Thus, for example, in trading
with Western European countries and Japan the United States has the greatest
comparative factor price advantage in either land or natural resources.
The relative size of the coefficients for physical capital and skilled labor

7

also indicates that the former is the relatively cheaper factor when

comparing the United States with other developed countries (France is the
exception), whereas skilled labor is the cheaper when the comparison is with

less developed countries. Except for Southeast Asia where the coefficient
on land is unexpectedly low, unskilled labor is the relatively most expensive
factor in U.S. trade with Europe, Japan, and the developing countries.

U.S.—Canadian trade reveals that the factor price difference most favorable
for the United States is the one that exists for physical capital and
the least, the one for natural resources.7

By multiplying the factor shares of each industry by the appropriate
coefficients in Table 1, it is possible to calculate the bilateral export!
import ratio for each industry that is predicted for each region on the

basis of relative differences in factor prices (up to.a uniform factor of

proportionality) and a common constant term. The higher (lower) an
industry's predicted trade ratio the more (less) competitive in comparative
factor cost terms the U.S. industry is revealed to be in its trade with the
appropriate region.

The results of these calculations reveal, as expected, that the U.S.
is particularly strong in comparative factor cost terms vis

vis most

countries or regions in agricultural products, manufactured foodstuffs, tobacco,
lumber and wood products, chemicals, plastic and synthetic materials, drugs,

and computing equipment. A somewhat surprising result is the narrowness of
the 'U.S. relative factor cost strength in the machinery and equipment

categories. Though the U.S. export surplus in these sectors is still
significant, it is only with developing countries where the United States has

8

a strong cost advantage. (The same holds for the various metal products.)
Moreover, the United States is now at a significant factor cost disadvantage
in its trade with Japan in many of the machinery and equipment categories.

Other than the revealed strength of the Japanese over a very wide
range of products there are few surprises on the least—competitive list.

The breadth of the U.S. comparative disadvantage in apparel, miscellaneous
fabricated textile products, and footwear and leather products is well known.

Although the fabric and textile goods sectors are often lumped with the
apparel industry, the textile sectors are not nearly as weak as apparel.

Another point that emerges from the analysis is that other than in the
apparel and footwear fields, the United States is not as yet at a
significant factor cost disadvantage in its trade with developing nations.

IV. A Test of the Model's Ability to Predict Changes
in Export/Import Ratios

If comparative cost conditions and other determinants of trade flows
are reasonably stable between two periods and there are lags of adjustment
in export/import ratios, the model can be used for the purpose of predicting

changes in trade ratios across countries. A test on how well this technique
works was undertaken by regressing changes in the export/import ratio from
1972 to 1979 on the residuals of the estimated equation (3), which are
measures of the deviation of the actual 1972 export/import ratio from its

predicted level. Specifically, the regression equation is:

(4)

[ln(X/M)1979 -

ln(X/M)1972]

=

a1

+ a2e + u

j=l,2,. .

.n,

9

where the .i3 are the residuals from the estimated equation (3), u. is
a normally distributed random term, and

and a2 are unknown constants.

A positive and significant result for a2 will suggest the technique is useful

for predictive purposes. Table 2 indicates the results of this test.
As the t statistics in this table indicate, actual and predicted changes

are significantly related in the expected direction, On average, the actual
change between 1972 and 1979 in the log of the trade latio equalled a constant
term plus between one—third and one—half of the amount by which the predicted
1972 ratio differed from the actual 1972 ratio.
Another test undertaken was to examine changes in actual trade ratios

between 1972 and 1979 for only those bilateral industry relations where the
difference between the log of the 1972 predicted trade ratio and the log of
the 1972 actual trade ratio was absolutely "large", specifically, either

greater than +2 or less than —2. In both sample sets, about 75 percent of
the bilateral industry trade relationships moved in the expece4 direction.8
The country distribution of these predicted shifts in trade ratios is indicated in the first two columns of Table 3,

There are several other interesting features of this analysis. One is
the wide range of industries covered in both sample sets. The two—digit
industries within which the number of predicted increases in bilateral trade
ratios at the four—digit level not only exceeds the number of predicted

declines but where this excess amounts to at least 20 percent of all the
bilateral four—digit relationships in the industry are as follows;
(1) livestock and livestock products; (2) forestry and fishery products;
(3) stone and clay mining and quarrying; (4) wooden containers; (5) household

furniture; (6) other furniture and fixtures; (7) chemicals and selected

10

chemical products; (8) rubber and miscellaneous plastic products;
(9) primary iron and steel manufacturing; (10) electric lighting and wiring

equipment; and (11) optical, opthalmic and photographic equipment and
supplies.

Included in this list of predicted "winners" are not just competitively
strong industries such as livestock and livestock products, chemicals, selective
lighting and wiring equipment, and optical, opthalmic and photographic
equipment, but also industries that are comparatively weak in relative cost

terms, e.g., household furniture, and other furniture and fixtures. Either
recent (and not as yet fully exploited) technological developments had
brought a narrowing in the cost—disadvantage position of these latter sectors
or they had been burdened by policies that reduced their trade ratios below

their equilibrium levels. But for whatever reason, their inclusion on the list
emphasizes the point that industries with sizable trade deficits can also
have the potential for significant improvements in their trade ratios.

Shifting to the "losers" side, at the four—digit level the net number
of predicted declines in bilateral trade ratios exceeds 20 percent of the

pairwise trading relationships in the following two—digit sectors: (1) paper
and allied products except containers and boxes; (2) paperboard containers
and boxes; (3) paints and allied products; (4) heating, plumbing and fabricated
structural metal products; (5) construction, mining and oil field machinery
and equipment; (6) metalworking machinery and equipment; (7) service industry
machinery; (8) electronic components and accessories; and (9) aircraft and parts.
This list also brings out the point that an industry's current status in terms

of its relative cost strength is not a good predictor of the sector's future

prospects. For example, the paint and aircraft industries both are among

ii-

our most competitive industries in terms of comparative costs. However,
their strong positions seem to be eroding and lower export/import ratios are

predicted. The predicted widespread decline in the trade position of the
various machinery and equipment sectors is also worthy of special note.

As mentioned previously, Japan is now more competitive in cost terms in

these industries. However, predicted declines in this sector cover not only
trade with Japan but with both other developed and developing nations.

The last two columns in Table 3 show for each country or region the
percent of trade ratios predicted to increase or decrease that changed

between 1972 and 1979 in the predicted direction. The variations among the
percentages could indicate differences in the degree to which trade is

restricted between the United States and the specified countries.9 For
example, the comparatively low percentage of correctly predicted increases
for South Asia, East Asia and Italy may reflect higher barriers against U.S.

exports in these areas. Similarly, the lower shares of correctly predicted
declines in trade ratios in the cases of the United Kingdom, Japan, Italy
and Germany may indicate that the United States restricts the importation of
goods from these nations relatively more than for the other countries listed.

V. Conclusions

On the basis of an analysis of changes in industry—by—country export!
import ratios for the United States between 1972 and 1979, the technique
set forth in this paper seems to be useful as a means of predicting changes

in a country's bilateral trade ratios. However, one would want to examine
other time periods and other sets of bilateral trade ratios before making

any strong statement along these lines. There are, moreover, several

12

improvements that should and can be made in any further studies based on

the technique. One is to introduce explicit differences in tariffs and
transportation costs as sources (besides factor—price differences) of

differences in unit costs)0 Future investigations should also deal more
directly with the problem of interpreting the estimated coefficients that
arises because of the existence of imported intermediate products.
Hilton (1981) outlines some ways of handling this problem and also indicates
the data requirements and methodology for estimating a truly multicountry

model. Even nore difficult problems to de.l with in the guture concern
taking into account the differences in technology, in the extent of scale
economies, and in levels of nontariff distortions that exist between countries
and industries.
