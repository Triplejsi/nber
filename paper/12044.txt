Offshore Financial Centers: Parasites or Symbionts?

NBER Working Paper No. 12044
February 2006
JEL No. F23, F36
ABSTRACT
This paper analyzes the causes and consequences of offshore financial centers (OFCs). Since OFCs
are likely to be tax havens and money launderers, they encourage bad behavior in source countries.
Nevertheless, OFCs may also have unintended positive consequences for their neighbors, since they
act as a competitive fringe for the domestic banking sector. We derive and simulate a model of a
home country monopoly bank facing a representative competitive OFC which offers tax advantages
attained by moving assets offshore at a cost that is increasing in distance between the OFC and the
source. Our model predicts that proximity to an OFC is likely to have pro-competitive implications
for the domestic banking sector, although the overall effect on welfare is ambiguous. We test and
confirm the predictions empirically. OFC proximity is associated with a more competitive domestic
banking system and greater overall financial depth.

1. Introduction
Offshore financial centers (OFCs) are jurisdictions that oversee a disproportionate level
of financial activity by non-residents. Financial activity in OFCs is usually dominated by the
provision of intermediation services for larger neighboring countries. In this paper, we ask two
distinct questions concerning the causes and consequences of OFCs. First, why do some
countries become OFCs? Second, what are the consequences of OFCs for their neighbors?1
What makes a country likely to become an offshore financial center? We approach this
question with both bilateral and multilateral data sets. Using bilateral data from over 200
countries in the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS), we examine the determinants
of cross-border asset holdings for 2001 and 2002 using a gravity model. We confirm these
results using a probit model applied to a multilateral cross-section of over 200 countries for the
same time period. Unsurprisingly, tax havens and money launderers host more assets and are
more likely to be OFCs. These results are intuitive; one attraction of moving assets offshore is
the ability to pursue activities that are prohibited in source countries.
Do OFCs make bad neighbors? One might expect proximity to an OFC to be bad for the
neighborhood, since OFCs encourage tax evasion and other illegal activities. However, the
presence of nearby offshore financial centers may also have beneficial effects. Most
importantly, the presence of an OFC with an efficient financial sector may increase the
competitiveness of a source country’s banking sector, though this benefit is tempered by
transactions costs. The tradeoff between the positive and negative externalities of OFCs lies at
the heart of our paper.
To analyze this tradeoff, we develop a model where OFCs have this benign effect, even
though shifting assets offshore is costly. In our model a home country monopoly bank faces a

1

competitive fringe of OFCs that survive by offering tax advantages, subject to a fixed cost of
moving assets offshore. We use the model to examine the impact of OFC proximity on the
distribution of assets between the home country bank and the OFC. In general, proximity to an
OFC has ambiguous effects on welfare and asset distribution. When we simulate our model, we
find that OFCs have strong pro-competitive effects on the domestic banking sector. We then
take the predictions of the model to the data, and examine the impact of OFC proximity on
banking-sector competitiveness and financial depth. We robustly confirm the prediction that
OFCs have a pro-competitive impact on their neighbors. Proximity to an OFC also has a
positive effect on financial depth.
To summarize, we find that countries identified as tax havens and money launderers are
likely to be OFCs, encouraging tax evasion and nefarious activity in neighboring source
countries. Nevertheless, OFCs still provide substantial offsetting benefits in the form of
competitive stimulus for their neighbors’ financial sectors. This benign impact on local banking
conditions tends to mitigate the adverse effects of OFCs on tax evasion and illegal activity.
The next section analyzes OFC determination, using both bilateral and multilateral data
sets. Section 3 develops a theoretical model of OFCs that compete with a domestic monopolist
bank by providing tax benefits. Simulations of the model allow us to gauge the offsetting effects
on assets and welfare; these predictions are tested in section 4. The paper concludes with a brief
summary.

2. Determinants of Offshore Financial Centers
The costs of shifting assets offshore have fallen over time; but they remain non-trivial.
Why do assets get shifted offshore? More generally, why do offshore financial centers exist?

2

We begin our study by showing that OFCs are created to facilitate bad behavior in source
countries such as tax evasion and money laundering.
The small literature of relevance leaves little doubt that offshore financial centers
encourage tax evasion. Indeed, in their survey of OFC activity Hampton and Christensen (2002)
use the terms tax haven and OFC interchangeably; see also Masciandaro (forthcoming).
Recently, steps have been taken to mitigate the opportunities for tax evasion afforded by OFCs.
In 2000, the OECD identified over thirty countries as engaging in harmful tax evasion practices,
including countries such as Andorra, Bahrain, Cook Islands, and Dominica. Countries on the list
were given deadlines to change their policies and avoid sanctions.2 Most nations complied with
the OECD.3 The G7 has also pursued initiatives against money laundering practices, including
the creation of a Financial Action Task Force.4 Hampton and Christensen (2002) predict that
such initiatives will eventually erode OFCs’ advantages and push capital back “onshore.” Still,
the facilitation of tax evasion remains one of the most obvious determinants of OFC status.

2a. A Bilateral Approach to Cross-Border Asset Holdings
We begin by taking advantage of the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS)
data set. This data set is useful for studying the generic behavior of cross-border asset holdings.5
While there is no special place for offshore financial centers in the data set, all the conventional
OFCs are included in the data set (more on this below). This data set has its flaws; for instance,
certain areas (e.g., Aruba) have a large number of missing entries. Still, investigating these
bilateral asset stocks seems a good place to begin identifying why assets are held overseas, the
essential feature of offshore financial centers. This data set has been used by a number of other
scholars, including most prominently Lane and Milesi-Ferretti.6

3

The CPIS data are freely available at the IMFs website at year-ends for 2001 and 2002.7
In particular, we use Table 8, which provides a geographic breakdown of total portfolio
investment assets. These data form a bilateral matrix; they show stocks of cross-border holdings
of assets, measured at market prices. Thus, one can determine that e.g., at the end of 2001,
Argentine residents were reported to hold $29 million in total portfolio investment assets in
Austria.
Since the CPIS data set is bilateral, it is natural to use the well-known “gravity model” of
trade as a baseline. The gravity model explains activity between two countries as being a
positive function of the economic masses of the countries, and a negative function of the distance
between them. Variants of gravity models have been widely used in the literature by e.g.,
Alworth and Andresen (1992), Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2004), and Portes and Rey (2005). In
practice we use population and real GDP per capita to proxy economic mass, and great-circle
distance and a few other measures to proxy economic distance. After controlling for these
influences, we then investigate whether there is any additional role for institutional measures.
We use CPIS data for both 2001 and 2002. We drop a few insignificant areas because of
data difficulties.8 We are left with a bilateral data set with data from 69 source and 222 host
countries.9 (A list of the countries is provided in appendix table A1.) We then merge in a host of
bilateral variables taken from the gravity literature in international trade. These include: source
and host country population and real GDP per capita (both taken essentially from the World
Bank’s World Development Indicators). We also include colonial history, geographic features,
and measures of bilateral distance, common language, and common currency. The latter data are
mostly taken from Glick and Rose (2002). Further details and the datasets are available online.

4

To all these conventional variables, we add three sets of additional variables. First, we
add dummy variables for source/host countries that are tax havens and/or money launderers.10
For the former, we combine three indicators on tax havens, provided by the OECD, CIA, and
Hines and Rice (1994).11 For the latter, we use the June 2000 OECD Report from the Financial
Action Task Force on Money Laundering.12 Second, we add variables (again, for both source
and host countries) that measure the rule of law, political stability, and regulatory quality. These
are continuous variables (where higher values better governance), and are taken from
“Governance Matters III” by Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi (2003).13 Third, we add variables
for the legal origins (of both source and host countries), focusing on countries with legal origins
in common, civil, and French law.14
We estimate the following equation:

ln ( X ijt ) = β 0 + β1 ln ( Dij ) + β 2 ln (Yit ) + β 3 ln (Yij ) + β 4 ln ( Popit ) + β 5 ln ( Pop jt )
+ β 6Contij + β 7 Langij + β 8CU ijt + β 9ComColij + β10Colijt + β11 Island i

+γ 14Civil j + γ 15 Frenchi + γ 16 French j + ε ijt
where i denotes the source country, j denotes the host, t denotes time, ln(.) denotes the natural
logarithm operator, and the variables are defined as:
•

Xij denotes cross-holdings from i held in j, measured in millions of dollars,

•

D is the distance between i and j,

•

Y is annual real GDP per capita in dollars,

•

Pop is population,

•

Cont is a binary variable which is unity if i and j share a land border,

5

•

Lang is a binary “dummy” variable which is unity if i and j have a common language and
zero otherwise,

•

CU is a binary variable which is unity if i and j use the same currency at time t,

•

ComCol is a binary variable which is unity if i and j were both colonized by the same
country,

•

Col is a binary variable which is unity if i and j are colonies at time t,

•

Island is the number of island nations in the pair (0, 1, or 2),

•

Landl is the number of landlocked countries in the country-pair (0, 1, or 2),

•

Area is the area of the country (in square kilometers),

•

Taxh is a binary variable which is unity for tax havens,

•

Moneyl is a binary variable which is unity for money-launderers,

•

Rule is a measure of the rule of law,

•

Pol is a measure of political stability,

•

Reg is a measure of regulatory quality,

•

Common is a binary variable which is unity for common-law countries,

•

Civil is a binary variable which is unity for civil-law countries,

•

French is a binary variable which is unity for French-law countries,

•

β is a vector of nuisance coefficients, and

•

εij represents the omitted other influences on bilateral exports, assumed to be well behaved.

We estimate this equation with conventional OLS, using a robust covariance estimator to
handle heteroskedasticity, adding year-specific fixed effects. Rather than drop the observations
for which the stock of cross-holdings is zero, we substitute a very small number for zero (and the
occasional negative) values.15 The coefficients of interest to us are {γ}.
Our baseline results, excluding the institutional variables, are tabulated in the extreme left
column of Table 1. The model delivers sensible estimates. For instance, higher population and
GDP per capita in either the source or host countries encourage greater cross-holdings. Second,
geography matters, in the sense that more distance between the two countries lowers cross-

6

holdings, while a shared land border, language, or money raises them. All these effects are
sensible, economically large, and statistically significant at conventional significance levels.
Further, the model fits the data well, accounting for over half the variation in an essentially
cross-sectional data set. The results also seem robust to splitting the data into individual years,
and to dropping the zero values of the regressand (these sensitivity checks are tabulated in
successive columns).
We then add institutional details in the fifth column. The coefficients are collectively
significant and have sensible interpretations. Host countries that are tax havens and/or money
launderers are more likely to attract cross-holding; comparable source country effects are present
but smaller. Neither the rule of law nor the political stability of host countries seems to be
relevant. But politically unstable countries and those with a strong rule of law are both more
likely to send funds overseas. Finally, while regulatory quality in the source country has little
effect on cross-holdings, host countries with higher regulatory quality are much more likely to
attract assets. All this make sense.
Finally, in the last column (on the extreme right) of Table 1 we add dummy variables for
the legal origins of both source and host countries. These are of only minor relevance.
Common- and civil-law countries are more likely to be the source of cross-holdings; countries
with French law are less likely to be hosts.
We take two primary results from the bilateral sample: First, geography plays a
significant role in the determination of cross-border flows, even after conditioning for other
factors that may be correlated with distance that could affect cross-border flows. While a role
for geography would be obvious in the case of flows of goods, the role of distance in asset flows
is less obvious, but appears to be important in the data. Second, identification as a tax haven or

7

money launderer is associated with an increase in cross-border flows, suggesting that the desire
to circumvent local taxes or other local laws plays a role in the decision to move assets offshore.
Both of these considerations are addressed in the model introduced below.

2b. Multilateral Evidence on Offshore Financial Center Determination

We now corroborate our key findings from the bilateral CPIS data set with a multilateral
approach. In particular, we test for the importance of e.g., being a tax haven, using the common
law, or having political stability on the likelihood of being an offshore financial center.
Our multilateral approach is cross-sectional in nature. Since we are interested in
determining which countries have chosen to become OFCs, it is important first to identify the
OFCs themselves. Rather than develop our own methodology to identify OFCs, we gather these
data from three basic sources (which have considerable overlap). We use the dummy variables
indicating either “Financial Centre with Significant Offshore Activities” or “Major Financial
Centre with onshore and offshore activity” from Report of the Working Group on Offshore
Centres of the Financial Stability Forum.16 We also include “Countries and Territories with
Offshore Financial Centers” from Errico and Musalem (1999). Finally, we include
“International and Offshore Financial Centers” from IMF (2004), whether “Contacted – Module
2 Assessment” or “Contacted under the FSAP”.17 We further impose the requirement that the
OFC host at least $10 million in total assets, and that it not be an OECD country.18 This delivers
our default set of forty OFCs, which are listed in appendix Table A2. As can be seen from the
table, OFCs are clustered regionally; notable groupings are in the Caribbean and Europe.
Consistent with our results, they tend to be clustered around places with high taxes and a high
demand for nefarious financial activity.19

8

Our default set of OFCs is a 0/1 binary variable; a country either is or is not an offshore
financial center. To check the robustness of our results, we also construct a continuous variable.
This is derived by combining the three dummy variables above with two others. The first is a
dummy that is one if and only if the CIA mentions that the country is an “offshore financial
center” in its discussion of illicit drugs in the World Factbook.20 The second is derived by
aggregating (across source countries) the residuals from the default pooled model of Table 1.21
We then combine the variables by using the first principal factor from the five underlying
variables.22 This gives us a continuous version of our default binary variable. The two variables
are highly correlated (the correlation coefficient is .84).23
We gathered data on 223 countries (listed in appendix Table A3), including our default
set of forty OFCs. We use data averaged from 2001 and 2002, both to smooth the data and to
stick as close to our bilateral data set as closely as possible. We condition on the natural
logarithms of both population and real GDP per capita throughout (again, taken mostly from the
World Bank’s World Development Indicators). We then sequentially add: a) dummy variables
for tax havens and money launderers, b) the three institutional measures (rule of law, political
stability, and regulatory quality), and c) the three legal regimes. In panel A of Table 2 we use
our default dummy variable measure of OFCs, estimated using probit. Panel B is the analogue
that uses OLS (with robust standard errors) on our continuous measure of OFC activity.
The most striking results in Table 2 are in column (2), where we consider the first two
institutional features: tax haven and money laundering status. Being either a tax haven or a
money launderer has an economically and statistically strong effect in raising the probability of
being an OFC.24 This confirms our findings from the bilateral results that sinful countries are
strongly associated with offshore financial centers. On the other hand, our other measures of

9

institutional quality and the legal regime have no strong consistent effect on OFC determination.
Conditioning on population and GDP per capita seems to have little consistent strong effect.
We have engaged in extensive sensitivity analysis with respect to the determination of
OFCs; part of it is reflected in Table C. This shows the results of adding ten different variables
to the specification of column (2), which includes tax haven and money laundering status. Two
estimates are supplied: the middle column is the result of adding the variable to the probit
estimation for the default binary measure of OFCs, while the right column tabulates the OLS
coefficient from adding the variable to the continuous OFC specification.
We have successively added: a) a dummy variable that is unity if the country is Englishspeaking; b) the official supervisory power aggregate from Barth, Caprio and Levine (2001)25; c)
a dummy variable for the presence of capital controls taken from the IMFs Annual Report on
Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; d) the corporate tax rate, essentially taken
from Ernst & Young26; e) the country’s average Polity IV score27; f) average openness, the ratio
of exports plus imports to GDP, taken from the WDI; g) the UNDPs human development index28;
and lastly h) measures of political rights, civil rights, and freedom, all provided by Freedom
House.29 None of these variables are consistently strongly tied to our measures of OFCs despite
our best attempts. We also tabulate the p-values for the joint significance of two sets of dummy
variables: a) a set of regional variables; and b) a set of variables for colonial history (so that the
British variable is unity for all ex-British colonies, and so forth). We have also experimented
with a large number of other variables with a similar lack of success.30
Our most robust results from our probit estimation mirror those of the bilateral sample
above. The main characteristics of those countries identified as offshore financial centers are
identification as either tax havens or money launderers. This corroborates the bilateral results

10

from section 2a; a primary motivation for investors in moving assets offshore is circumvention of
domestic tax laws or other illegal activities. None of this seems terribly surprising to us; OFCs
seem to facilitate bad behavior. The more interesting question is whether they also provide
positive externalities as well; we now turn to that issue.

3. Consequences of Offshore Financial Centers

The evidence presented in section 2 indicates that tax havens and money launderers are
likely to be offshore financial centers. OFCs offer the advantage of e.g., lower taxes to domestic
investors that can bear the costs of shifting assets. That is, they compete with the domestic
banking sector. While OFCs lower the costs of unsavory practices such as tax evasion, they also
provide a benefit in the form of competition for the domestic financial sector. We now develop a
model that focus on the tradeoffs that OFCs present for source countries.31

3a. A Simple Theoretical Model of OFC Activity

We assume that the domestic (source) country is populated by a continuum of depositors,
indexed by i=1…m. Depositors are endowed with initial wealth, w(i). We number the depositors
such that the initial wealth of depositor i is less than or equal to the initial wealth of depositor
i+1. Depositors allocate their wealth to maximize their after-tax income. They can hold three
assets: onshore deposits; offshore deposits; and an outside alternative. All the assets we consider
below are risk-free.
We assume that the alternative asset (perhaps a government bond) yields an exogenous
rate of interest; r* is defined as one plus the interest rate on this asset. We define rH as one plus
the contractual rate of interest paid by the domestic bank on deposits and rO as one plus the

11

offshore contractual rate of interest on deposits. Since depositors allocate their savings to
maximize disposable wealth, each faces two arbitrage conditions, one for offshore deposits and
one for home deposits.
We assume that there is a fixed cost, denoted ax, of making an offshore deposit, where a
is a constant and x represents the “distance” from the home country to the offshore country. This
is modeled as an “iceberg” cost that melts away with offshore financial activity. This cost can be
offset by the tax advantage of offshore deposits, since we assume that offshore deposits are taxed
at a lower rate than the true tax rate. Onshore deposits, by way of contrast, are less costly but are
taxed at a higher rate.
If a representative depositor i places his deposits in the offshore bank, his final after-tax
wealth satisfies (1 − τ ) ⎡⎣θ rO w ( i ) − ax ⎤⎦ , where τ represents the nominal domestic tax rate and θ

is a parameter representing the tax advantage of the offshore nation, 1 ≤ θ ≤ 1/ (1 − τ ) . It follows
that depositor i will prefer to place his funds in the offshore bank relative to the risk free asset if
and only if

rO ≥

r *w ( i * ) + ax

θ w (i* )

(2)

The smaller are a, x, and r*, the more likely that depositor i is to take his assets offshore rather
than place them in the risk-free asset; ditto the larger are θ, rO, and w(i). We define i* as the
depositor that satisfies (2) with equality, i.e. as the depositor who is indifferent between taking
assets offshore and placing them in the risk-free asset. Since w(i) is positively monotonic in i,
(2) shows that all depositors i > i * will also take their assets offshore.
Alternatively, suppose that depositor i places his deposits in the domestic bank. We
model this as a monopoly; an extreme assumption to be sure, but one that allows us to focus on

12

the competitive effects easily (an alternative derivation using the assumption of a
monopolistically competitive domestic banking sector is provided in the appendix). The
depositor’s final wealth earns a return of (1 − τ ) rH . Thus depositors prefer the home bank if

rH ≥ r * . We demonstrate below that the profit-maximizing deposit rate for the home monopolist
bank is when this condition just binds, i.e. rH = r * . It follows that when condition (2) holds with
equality, depositor i is indifferent between taking his assets offshore and holding them in the
home country bank. The offshore bank then lends out all its deposits, LO , which equal
m

LO = ∫ w ( i ) di

(3)

i*

Borrowers in the model are assumed to obtain funds from banks under standard debt
contracts, taking the home-country demand for loans as given. Borrowers are indifferent
between bank sources, so a single lending rate will prevail in the home country. Let R represent
one plus the contractual interest rate on lending. We assume that R is decreasing in aggregate
lending, L, which is the sum of home bank lending, LH and offshore bank lending, LO, where
R ' < 0 , and R " < 0 .

The offshore bank acts as a competitor and a Stackelberg follower. The offshore bank
faces diseconomies of scale in lending because of the fixed cost of moving assets offshore. The
minimum interest rate consistent with any value of i * is that which induces all depositors i * and
greater to take their assets offshore. Having exhausted this segment of the population, however,
the offshore bank can only further increase its deposits by attracting depositors that are less
wealthy. The fixed cost of moving assets offshore bites these poorer depositors more intensely,
as the fixed cost is spread over a smaller deposit. As a result, the offshore bank must offer a

13

greater premium over the domestic risk free rate to increase its deposits. This effectively results
in an upward-sloping supply of funds facing the offshore bank.
Taking domestic lending as given, the offshore bank raises deposits at rates where (2) is
binding and issues loans until it satisfies its zero profit condition

θ w ( i * ) R = r *w ( i * ) + ax .

(4)

Totally differentiating (4), the comparative static relationship between LO and LH
satisfies

θ w ( i* ) R '
∂LO
=
<0
∂LH (θ R − r * ) w '− θ w ( i * )2 R '
2

(5)

Equation (4) demonstrates that lending by the domestic bank crowds out lending by the
OFC. However, note that dLO / dLH < 1 , which implies that crowding out is less than one for
one, so that an increase in LH increases overall lending levels.
We next turn to the lending decision of the home country bank. The domestic bank acts
as a profit-maximizing Stackelberg leader. It takes in deposits equal to LH , which results in an
end-of-period liability of rH LH . Domestic profits are equal to

π = [ R − rH ] LH

14

(6)

As profits are decreasing in rH , it follows that the profit-maximizing decision of the
home country bank entails setting rH = r * and maximizing with respect to the choice of LH . By
the envelope theorem, the first-order condition of the home country bank satisfies

R − r * + R ' LH = 0

(7)

Equations (4) and (7) form a system of equations in two unknowns, LH and i * . In the
appendix, we conduct some comparative static exercises to evaluate the properties of the model.
We demonstrate that an increase in the OFC tax advantage, θ , increases offshore lending, LO ,
and reduces home country bank lending, LH , but less than one for one, resulting in an increase in
overall lending. We also demonstrate that OFC lending is decreasing in distance to the home
country, x . We again find a crowding out effect, as decreased OFC distance reduces home
country lending, but again by less than the primary effect of increasing lending by the OFC.
Effectively, proximity to the OFC increases the competitiveness of the domestic banking market.
We take the latter result to the data below.
An alternative strategy for the home country bank to the interior solution above is to
“limit-price” by issuing sufficient loans that the OFC can not compete in the home market. By
(4), the home bank can limit-price by issuing an amount of loans that satisfies

R ( LH ) ≤

r * w ( i * ) + ax

θ w ( i* )

15

(8)

Satisfaction of equation (8) with inequality implies that the OFC would lose money upon
entry. Note that as x (the distance between the OFC and the home country) grows, (8) implies
that the domestic loans necessary to achieve limit-pricing becomes arbitrarily small. Indeed, it
may fall below the pure monopoly solution for the home country bank in the absence of the
OFC, which is the solution to (7) given LO = 0 .
It follows that as x increases from 0, the solution for the home country bank passes
through three distinct ranges: First, it follows the interior solution to (7), competing head-tohead with the OFC. As distance between the OFC and the home country grows further, the
home bank switches to the limit pricing strategy in (8). Finally, when the OFC is sufficiently
distant, the limit pricing solution falls below the monopoly optimum, which is the level of LH
that satisfies (7) conditional on LO = 0 , and the domestic bank switches to the pure monopoly
solution. These transitions are illustrated in our simulations below.
Finally, we turn to the question of the impact of the OFC on home country welfare. We
assume that taxes are redistributed lump sum, so that home-country welfare is invariant to the
level of government revenues.32 Home country welfare can therefore be measured in terms of
the net gains from intermediation relative to placing all deposits in the alternative asset. This is
the sum of borrower consumer surplus, home bank profitability and depositor revenues, net of
taxes and the cost of moving funds offshore. Adding these together and simplifying yields:

L

W = ∫ ( R − r * )dl − ( m − i * ) ax

(9)

0

Equation (9) demonstrates the welfare tradeoff associated with proximity to an OFC. On
one hand, the OFC induces the home country bank to behave more competitively, increasing
16

lending and overall welfare. On the other hand, depositors are partially motivated to take their
funds offshore for purely redistributive reasons, in particular to lower their taxes. While the
redistribution does not affect welfare, the resource cost of moving those assets offshore is a
deadweight loss. As a result, the overall impact on domestic welfare of OFC-proximity is
ambiguous.

3b. Simulations

To gauge the impact of the OFCs’ proximity and tax advantage on overall activity in the
home country, we now simulate the model. For simplicity, we model w(i) as a linear function,
setting w to an exogenous constant. We also assume that the domestic interest rate is a
(negative) linear function of domestic lending, L that satisfies

R = R + R'L

(10)

where R and R ' are constants R > 0 , R ' < 0 .
Given these assumptions, we derive the expressions for (4) and (7) in the appendix. This
yields a system of two equations in two unknowns, LH and i*. The solution allows us to
determine both the equilibrium loan rate and aggregate welfare.
We parameterize the model by setting the return on the alternative asset r* equal to 1.2.
We set the tax advantage of the OFC, θ, to 1.2 (though we have also examined alternative values
without any large change in results). We set the cost of moving assets offshore, a, to 1.33 We set
w equal to 2 and m equal to 1. This normalization implies that the equilibrium value of i*

represents the share of depositors who do not take their assets offshore, as depositors 0 through
i* leave their assets in the home country. Finally, we normalize local interest rates by setting R

equal to 2 and R’ equal to -0.85, although we entertain other values of R ' below.

17

While numerical values are a necessary part of our simulations, we concentrate on their
qualitative results. Figure 1 plots home-bank lending ( LH ) , total lending ( L) , interest rates ( R ) ,
and welfare as a function of distance to the OFC ( x ) , for different values of R ' . It can be seen
that proximity to the OFC has the pro-competitive impact that we anticipated. It can also be seen
that there are three distinct ranges, with discrete jumps in all values when the home bank
switches from competing head-to-head to a limit pricing strategy.
It is useful to consider the impacts on all of the endogenous variables as x increases.
Beginning at x=0, we are first in the range where the monopoly bank competes with the OFC
head to head. As distance to the OFC increases, the home country bank expands its lending,
taking advantage of the deterioration in competitiveness of the OFC. Nevertheless, the increase
in LH is more than offset by a decline in LO , so that overall lending is declining. It can be seen
that over this range R increases with distance, so that increased proximity to the OFC has the
expected impact of increasing the competitiveness of the domestic banking sector.
Note that welfare falls dramatically with increased distance within this range, even
relative to the pure monopoly solution. Welfare losses with increased distance come from two
sources: the decreased competitiveness of the banking sector , and the increased cost of moving
assets offshore. Of course, the latter eventually reduces the amount of offshore activity taking
place.
As x increases beyond xLP , the home country bank switches to a limit-pricing strategy,
lending the amount necessary to keep the OFC out of its market. It can be seen that there is a
discrete increase in both home and overall lending at this point, resulting in a discrete decline in
R, as well as a discrete increase in overall welfare. As x increases within the limit pricing

18

range, overall lending and welfare decline, as the amount of home bank lending necessary to
preclude entry by the OFC decreases.
Finally, when x reaches xM the minimum level of lending to achieve limit pricing
matches the pure monopoly solution. At this point, home country lending, as well as the other
variables, are invariant to further increases in x.

4. Evidence on the Impact of OFCs on their Neighbors

We now take the theoretical predictions of the previous section to the data. Our model
suggests that home country bank profits are declining in proximity to the OFC, while overall
local lending is increasing in OFC proximity.34 Accordingly, we use our multilateral data set to
address two questions. First, is OFC proximity actually associated with increased domestic
banking competitiveness? Second, is OFC proximity also associated with greater financial
intermediation? We use different measures of both banking competitiveness and financial
intermediation that are common in the literature, and control for a number of auxiliary
explanatory variables.
We use the multilateral data set that we developed and employed in section 2b above.
This is a cross-section from 2001-02 that includes 40 OFCs (tabulated in Table A2) among the
223 countries in our sample (tabulated in Table A3). Our measure of OFC proximity is (the
natural logarithm of the) distance to the nearest OFC.35 This serves as the regressor for our
coefficient of interest.
Our base specification conditions on the natural logarithms of both population and real
GDP per capita, as well as a dummy variable for countries that are OFCs themselves. In
subsequent specifications, we add a number of additional conditioning variables to check the

19

sensitivity of our results. These controls include dummy variables for legal regimes based on
Civil or French Law, hours of latitude, a landlocked nation dummy variable, and the percentage
of population that is Christian or Muslim. Remoteness for country i is defined traditionally, as
the average (log) distance between i and (log) GDP in the rest of the world; this variable is
intended to serve as an indicator of overall remoteness, rather than the remoteness associated
with distance from an OFC.36 We also add a variable for openness, measured as total trade as a
percentage of GDP. We also tabulate simple bivarate regression results, without any controls at
all (except a constant). Finally, we provide instrumental variable results, motivated by the
results of Table 2. As instrumental variables for distance to the closest OFC, we use: 1) OFC
remoteness; 2) distance to the closest tax haven; and 3) distance to the closest money launderer.
Our estimating equation takes the form:

y i = β ln(min DistOFC ) i + γ 0 + γ 1OFC i
+ γ 2 ln( Pop) i + γ 3 ln(Y / Pop ) i + Controls + ε i

(11)

where the notation follows that of equation (1), and the coefficient of interest is β.
We first test the effect of OFC proximity on domestic banking competitiveness. Thus for
the regressand, y, we use three measures of the degree of competitiveness of the local banking
sector: a) the interest rate spread (loan-deposit) charged by commercial banks, b) the
concentration ratio of the domestic banking industry, measured as the industry share accounted
for by the top five commercial banks, and c) the number of commercial banks in a country
divided by the log of domestic GDP.37 The coefficient of interest to us is β1, the effect of OFC
proximity on domestic banking competitiveness; we expect this to be positive for the first two

20

regressands (interest spread and concentration ratio) and negative for the last (banks/GDP). We
estimate our models with OLS/IV, employing standard errors robust to heteroskedasticity.
Our results are shown in Panel A of Table 3. All of our estimates suggest that OFC
remoteness is associated with an increase in monopoly power at statistically and economically
significant levels. The standard deviation of the minimum distance from OFC variable is 1.07, so
our point estimates suggest that a one standard deviation increase in distance to an OFC is
associated with, e.g., between an increase of 1.41 and a 2.21 percent in the interest rate spread
and an increase of 1.77 to 8.22 percent in the share of the banking industry controlled by the five
largest commercial banks. The results for interest rate spreads and bank concentration are
statistically significant at standard significance levels when controls are included (only the
second is clearly significant with IV). The effect of OFC proximity on the number of banks
(scaled by log GDP) is more marginally significant, but improves with the number of controls.
It seems that OFC proximity is in fact associated with more competitive domestic banking.
We next turn to the impact of distance from an OFC on the depth of domestic financial
intermediation. We use three measures of intermediation commonly used in the literature: a)
credit to the private sector, b) quasi-liquid liabilities, and c) M2, all three measures normalized
by GDP.38 We now expect the coefficient of interest, β, to be consistently negative, since OFC
proximity should increase domestic financial intermediation.
Our results are shown in Panel B of Table 3. The effect of distance to the closest OFC on
financial intermediation is consistently negative. Moreover, it is significantly different from zero
at conventional statistical levels for two of our three proxies, the ratios of quasi-liquid liabilities
to GDP and M2 to GDP. Distance from OFC has a negative but insignificant effect on credit to
the private sector as a percentage of GDP, except for the (less interesting) bivariate regression.39

21

Again, these results are robust to a number of alternative specifications. The point estimates also
indicate that proximity to an OFC is consistently of economic significance.40
In summary, we find evidence that distance from an OFC is associated with a lack of
competitiveness in the local banking sector as indicated by our theory. Moreover, financial
depth is positively associated with OFC proximity. While the results are not always of strong
statistical significance, we interpret them as broadly confirming the prediction of the model.41

5. Conclusion

This paper examines both the determinants of offshore financial centers and the
consequences of OFCs for their neighbors. Using both bilateral and multilateral samples, we
find empirically that successful offshore financial centers encourage bad behavior in source
countries, since they facilitate tax evasion and money laundering. At first blush, it thus appears
that OFCs are best characterized as “parasites,” since their attraction stems in part from allowing
their source-country clients to engage in activities detrimental to the well-being of their homes.
Nevertheless, offshore financial centers created to facilitate undesirable activities can still
have unintended positive consequences. In particular, the presence of OFCs enhances the
competitiveness of the local banking sector. Using a model of a domestic monopoly bank facing
a competitive fringe of OFCs, we demonstrate that OFC proximity enhances the competitive
behavior of the monopoly bank and may increase overall welfare. This is true despite the fact
that deadweight losses are borne when funds are transferred offshore to an OFC. We test these
predictions using a multilateral data set, and show that proximity to an OFC is indeed associated
with a more competitive domestic banking sector, and greater financial intermediation. We
tentatively conclude that OFCs are better characterized as “symbionts.”

Appendix 1: A Monopolistically-Competitive Model

In this appendix, we examine a monopolistically-competitive domestic banking sector.
We make the same assumptions concerning domestic depositors and the offshore bank, so that
equation (4) still represents the zero-profit condition for the offshore bank.
To introduce monopolistic competition, we assume that there are a large number n of
homogeneous monopolistically-competitive banks who paid a fixed entry cost, c . The
representative domestic bank takes n, lk

( k ≠ j ) , and

LO as given and faces an individual

downward-sloping demand curve R , which is assumed to be more elastic than the overall
demand curve faced by the offshore bank, i.e. R ' > R ' . Moreover, the elasticity of demand
faced by the representative domestic bank is assumed to be an increasing function of n ; the
greater is n , the greater is the capacity to improve market share from local rivals.
Representative bank profits satisfy

π j = ⎡⎣ R ( n, l j + ( n − 1) l j + LO ) − r * ⎤⎦ l j
The representative bank maximizes its profits with respect to its choice of l j . The firstorder condition of the representative domestic bank satisfies
⎡ R ( l j + ( n − 1) lk + LO ) − r * ⎤ + R ' l j = 0

In equilibrium, all domestic banks are assumed to be identical, and the overall demand
curve is assumed to be the same as that faced by the offshore bank, so that the first order
condition becomes
⎛m
⎞
R ⎜ ∫ w ( i ) di + nl ⎟ − r * + R ' l = 0
⎜*
⎟
⎝i
⎠

It is convenient to rewrite the zero profit condition for the offshore bank in terms of
individual domestic bank lending levels and n :

⎛m

⎞

⎝ i*

⎠

θ w ( i* ) R ⎜⎜ ∫ w ( i ) di + nl ⎟⎟ − r * w ( i* ) − ax = 0
Finally, banks will enter until their zero profit condition is satisfied:
⎡ ⎛m
⎞ *⎤
⎢ R ⎜⎜ ∫ w ( i ) di + nl ⎟⎟ − r ⎥ l = c
⎠
⎣⎢ ⎝ i*
⎦⎥
The last three equations form a system in three unknowns, i * , n , and l :
⎡ w ' (θ R − r * ) − θ w ( i * )2 R ' θ w ( i * ) R ' n
⎢
⎢
− w ( i* ) R '

The determinant of the system satisfies:
D = w ' (θ R − r * ) ( R ' l ) ⎡ R ' l − ( R − r * ) ⎤
⎣
⎦
2
−∂ R '/ ∂n ⎡ w ' (θ R − r * ) ⎡⎣( R − r * ) + R ' nl ⎤⎦ − θ w ( i* ) R ' ( R − r * ) ⎤
⎢⎣
⎥⎦

Since R ' > R ' by assumption, ( R − r * ) + R ' nl < 0 by the domestic bank’s first order
condition. A sufficient (but not necessary) condition for signing the determinant is then that
∂ R '/ ∂n is not too large.
The comparative statics for a change in x then satisfy:
di * 1 ⎡ ⎡
= a R ' l − ( R − r * ) ⎤ ( R ' l ) − ( R − r * + R ' nl ) ∂ R '/ ∂n ⎤ > 0

Note that l and n move in opposite directions with a change in x . For example, with closer
proximity to an OFC, n declines as there is exit from the domestic banking sector in the face of
heightened competition from the OFC. However, the declines in domestic lending is partially
offset by the increase in l , lending per bank. The change in overall lending satisfies:

Since overall lending increases as x declines, it is easy to show that domestic interest

Appendix 2: Comparative Statics and Simulation Details for the Monopolistic Model

1. Comparative static exercises
We first examine the impact of changes in the tax advantage enjoyed by the OFC, which
is proxied by changes in θ . By equations (4) and (7), the system of equations satisfies:
⎡ w ' (θ R − r * ) − θ w ( i * )2 R ' θ w ( i * ) R ' ⎤ ⎡ di * ⎤ ⎡ w i * R −a ⎤ dθ
⎡ ⎤

⎥
⎢ − w ( i * ) ( R '+ R " L )

2 R '+ R " LH ⎥⎦ ⎣ dLH ⎦ ⎢⎣ 0
H
⎣

The determinant of the matrix of the system satisfies:
D = w ' (θ R − r * ) ( 2 R '+ R " LH ) − θ w ( i* )

( R ')

The comparative statics for a change in θ satisfy:

(

di *

w ( i * ) R ( 2 R '+ R " LH ) < 0
dθ

dLH

which implies that

dL 1

dθ D

The comparative statics for a change in x satisfy
di * 1
= a ( 2 R '+ R " LH ) > 0
dx D

dLH

= aw ( i * ) ( R '+ R " LH ) > 0
dx
D
which implies that
dL

2. Simulation solution
Given the assumption that w ( i ) = wi , the deposit rate paid by the OFC satisfies
rO =

r * wi + ax
θ wi

and by (3) OFC lending given i * satisfies
LO =

w 2 *2
(m − i )
2

so that overall lending satisfies
L = LH +

w 2 *2
(m − i )
2

Given the functional form for R in (10), the equilibrium condition for OFC lending
given LH in (4) satisfies:

θ wi* ( R + R ' L ) − r * wi* − ax = 0
By (8) the first-order condition of the home country monopoly bank satisfies

( R + R ' L) − r

*

+ R ' LH = 0

The above two equations form a system of two equations in two unknowns, LH and i * .
Finally, our welfare measure satisfies

(

W = R − r* L +

R ' L2 − ( m − i * ) ax

Alworth and Andresen (1992) is an antecedent of our work that estimates the determinants of cross-country bank
deposits using BIS data between 17 source and 23 host countries for 1983, 1986, and 1990. They find a significant
role for bank secrecy in attracting deposits, presumably to facilitate tax evasion and/or money-laundering. Portes
and Rey (2005) focus instead on equity using a bilateral panel of data between 14 rich countries (including Hong
Kong and Singapore) from 1989 through 1996; they find a strong role for information in explaining asset flows.
6
For instance, Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2004) conduct an analysis that is complementary to ours. While we both
use gravity models, our analysis includes all assets for 2001-02 and focuses on the role of OFCs. In contrast, they
analyze portfolio equity for 2001 using the CPIS data set and exclude OFCs.

In particular, the CPIS data show no cross-border holdings for e.g., the British Indian Ocean Territory (Diego
Garcia), Christmas Island, and others; we drop them from our sample. We also drop areas with small holdings but
other data problems, such as the French Southern Territories (Iles Crozet, Iles Kerguelen, Ile Amsterdam, and Ile
Saint-Paul), and Niue.
9
We use the word “country” to denote any territory or area for which we have data (of relevance); these need not be
e.g., diplomatically recognized sovereign states with UN seats. Thus we include: territories (e.g., American Samoa);
physical disparate parts of countries (e.g., Aruba); self-governing areas (e.g., Cook Islands); special administrative
areas (e.g., Hong Kong); dependencies (e.g., Guernsey); commonwealths in political unions (e.g., Northern Mariana
Islands); disputed areas (e.g., Taiwan) and so forth.
10
Huizinga and Nielsen (2002) provide a related theoretical analysis of the differences between information
provision and withholding taxes in the context of taxing interest across national boundaries. See also OECD (2000).
In future work it would be interesting to treat tax havens and money launderers endogenously.
11
Further details and the underlying data themselves are available at the sources. The OECD identifies tax havens
on the basis of underlying policies. For instance, pp 9-10 of the OECDs’s 2000 Report to the Ministerial Council
Meeting Towards Global Tax Co-operation lists the four main factors that are used to 47 tax havens identified by
the OECD: 1) low or no nominal taxes on the relevant income; 2) a regime that is ring-fenced from the domestic
economy; 3) low transparency about the regime’s disclosure, regulatory supervision, tax details and/or application,
and 4) no effective exchange of information. More details are available at
www.oecd.org/dataoecd/9/61/2090192.pdf. The CIA also provides (a little) more information on its data, at
http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/fields/2116.html.
12
We use the 2000 data since it was the first review by the FATF, and use jurisdictions either reviewed or reviewed
and deemed non-cooperative countries or territories. More details are available at
http://www1.oecd.org/fatf/pdf/AR2000_en.pdf. For an analysis that treats money laundering as a choice variable
determined by the national authorities, see Masciandaro (forthcoming).

The “offshore financial centers” that are caught by the latter requirement since they are OECD countries are:
USA; UK; Austria; Luxembourg; Netherlands; Switzerland; Japan; Ireland; Australia; and Hungary. In our analysis,
we label these as non-OFCs, but retain the in the sample. Of the potential OECD OFCs, we consider only
Luxembourg to be a potentially serious issue.

OFCs also tend to be largely absent from places with poor banking systems (such as Africa and Central Asia),
consistent with the results we present below.

The aggregated residual has at the top: Cayman Islands; British Virgin Islands; Netherlands Antilles; Liberia; and
Tuvalu. While this – and the set of countries ranked slightly lower down – makes sense, the countries at the other
end are more suspicious. They include: Faroe Islands; French Polynesia; Greenland; Puerto Rico; and Isle of Man.
The last entry and a few others towards the bottom (e.g., Macau, Malta, UAE, and Aruba) make us take this measure
with a grain of salt.
22
Each of the five has positive factor loadings and scoring coefficients; the first factor explains essentially all of the
variance of the five variables.
23
The continuous variable has at the top: Cayman Islands; British Virgin Islands; Panama; Bahamas; and Singapore.
The countries at the other end include: Faroe Islands; French Polynesia; Greenland; Martinique; and Syria.
24
This result is consistent with the approach of Huizinga and Nielsen (2002) who treat policies like withholding
taxes and information provision as substitute policies.

30
We have also a) redefined our OFC dummy to include the ten OECD countries sometimes as identified as OFCs;
and b) dropped these same ten countries from our analysis. Nothing of substance changes when we do this
sensitivity analysis.
31
The logic of our approach is similar to that of Claessens and Laeven (2004).
32
One could easily imagine an extension of the model where taxes had a distortionary impact and the loss of
revenues to the home country government resulted in higher tax rates and therefore welfare-reducing increases in
domestic distortions.
33
Note that the value of a effectively only determines the normalization for x (the distance parameter) as x only
enters into the cost function in conjunction with a.
34
Our model predicts this behavior within the range where the home country bank was not engaged in limit-pricing,
which we perceive to be the norm.
35
Our concentration on the nearest individual OFC is in the spirit of constant returns to scale in the banking
technology of the OFC in our theoretical model. We also examined the sum of distances in miles to all of the OFCs
as a robustness check. These results were very similar to those reported below.
36
Thus the most remote countries are the Cook Islands, New Zealand, Niue, and French Polynesia, while the least
remote countries are Croatia, Slovenia, Italy, and Austria.
37
Data for local bank concentration and the number of commercial banks come from Demirguc-Kunt and Levine
(2001).
38
The first measure is obtained from Levine, Loayza, and Beck (2000) and is the average over 1980-1995. The
latter are obtained from Barth, Caprio, and Levine (2001).
39
The distance from OFC variable does robustly enter significantly as a determinant of credit to the private sector
when the GDP per capita variable is omitted from the specification. However, this yields a rather uninteresting
specification because it is well-documented that GDP per capita is highly correlated with measures of financial
depth, e.g. Demirgüç-Kunt and Levine (2001).
40
We have searched for a scale effect by interacting our measure of OFC proximity with the natural logarithms of
either real GDP or the population. However, the coefficients on these terms are consistently economically and
statistically small and insignificant. We have also attempt to link the Claessens and Laeven (2004) measure of bank
competitiveness to our determinants without success. This is almost surely a result of the much smaller sample size;
while their Table 3 provides estimates of H-statistics for fifty countries, that is still less than a third the size of the
sample in our Tables 3 and 4.
41
It is possible that channels other than the pro-competitive impact stressed in our model are also at work generating
this result. In particular, it is possible that proximity to OFCs changes government policies towards its financial
system, which may alter the cost of conducting intermediation for domestic banks.
