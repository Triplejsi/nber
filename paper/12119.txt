ABSTRACT
While many studies have looked at innovation and adoption of technologies separately, the two
processes are linked. Advances (and expected advances) in a single technology should affect both
its adoption rate and the adoption of alternative technologies. Moreover, advances made abroad may
affect adoption differently than improvements developed domestically. This paper combines
plant-level data on U.S. coal-fired electric power plants with patent data pertaining to NOx pollution
control techniques to study these links. I show that technological advances, particularly those made
abroad, are important for the adoption of newer post-combustion treatment technologies, but have
little effect on the adoption of older combustion modification techniques. Moreover, I provide
evidence that adaptive R&D by U.S. firms is necessary before foreign innovations are adopted in the
U.S. Expectations of future technological advances delay adoption. Nonetheless, as in other studies
of environmental technologies, the effect of other explanatory variables is dominated by the effect
of environmental regulations, demonstrating that the mere presence of environmental technologies
is not enough to encourage its usage.

In recent years, economists have paid increasing attention to the links between
environmental policy and technological change. More stringent environmental regulation can be
expected to both increase levels of innovation directed at environmentally-friendly technology
and encourage increased adoption of such technologies. While many studies have looked at
environmental innovation or diffusion separately, these processes are clearly linked – adoption of
a new technology cannot take place until innovation has taken place. This paper explores
linkages between available technologies and adoption of one of two air pollution control
technologies by coal-fired electric power plants, considering both the availability of technologies
developed at home and abroad, as well as expectations about future technological progress.
The diffusion of a new technology is a gradual, dynamic process. New technologies are
not adopted en masse. Rather, adoption usually begins with a few early adopters, followed by a
more rapid period of adoption, with the rate of adoption leveling off once most potential users
have adopted the technology. This process generates the well-known S-shaped diffusion curve.1
Early attempts to explain this process focused on the spread of information (epidemic models,
such as Griliches 1957) and differences among firms (probit models, such as David 1969).
Recent models combine these explanations while adding potential strategic decisions of
firms.2 Karshenas and Stoneman (1993) discuss three potential dynamic interactions. The rank
effect derives from probit models – potential adopters are ranked by their gross benefits, and
those with the greatest benefits go first. Stock and order effects relate to the cumulative number
of adopters. Both deal with strategic interactions – those who adopt faster face less competition
and receive first mover advantages. As a result, early adopters gain greater net benefits than later
adopters. For example, both Karshenas and Stoneman (1993) and Kerr and Newell (2003) find

that the percentage of firms already adopting the technology negatively affects the probability of
adoption, which they attribute to these first-mover advantages.
These explanations, however, ignore a potential benefit of waiting. Those that adopt later
receive the benefit of technological advances and may adopt technologies superior to those
chosen by early adopters (see, for example, Rosenberg 1976). While previous models implicitly
consider such advantages (such as through falling costs, which are often modeled as qualityadjusted), few empirical studies of diffusion consider the potential benefits of improved
technology.3 One exception is Weiss (1994), who uses survey data to show that expectations of
more rapid technological change to come delay adoption. In contrast, this paper uses publiclyavailable patent data to measure technological progress.

As such, the methodology used

potentially allows the study of technological progress and diffusion across a wide range of
technologies.
This paper uses patent data to examine the role that technological advances play in the
adoption of technologies designed to reduce nitrogen dioxide (NOX) emissions at coal-fired
electric power plants in the United States. This adoption decision is of interest for several
reasons. Most importantly, unlike most other pollutants, U.S. NOX regulations have historically
lagged behind those of other nations, particularly Japan and Germany. As a result, the path of
innovations in each country differed (Popp 2006). To meet the more stringent regulations in
Japan and Germany, post-combustion emissions treatment techniques were developed.

In

contrast, innovations in the U.S. focused on modifications to the combustion process. Such
modifications are cheaper, but do not reduce emissions as well as post-combustion treatment.
Thus, combustion modifications are more useful when NOX regulations are less stringent. Over

Examples of theoretical models including technological expectations include Balcer and Lippman (1984), Ireland
and Stoneman (1986), Tsur et al. (1990), and Lissoni (2000).

time, as NOX emission rules have been tightened in the U.S., more U.S. plants have adopted
post-treatment techniques.
As a result, the study of NOX abatement technology choices allows us to examine how
changes in the available knowledge, developed both at home and abroad, affect the adoption
decision. In particular, I ask whether firms take advantage of foreign technologies directly, or
must first perform additional research to adopt these technologies to domestic markets. For
example, Popp (2006) shows that patents granted in the U.S. for post-combustion treatment by
Japanese and German inventors increased when strict NOX regulations were enacted in those
countries in the 1970s and 1980s. Despite the ready availability of these technologies, there is a
similar spike in patents from U.S. inventors once U.S. regulations catch up in the 1990s.
However, Popp (2006) also shows that these U.S. patents are much more likely to cite earlier
foreign patents than are U.S. patents for other air pollution control technologies, even after
controlling for differences among the number of foreign and domestic patents available.4 This
suggests that domestic R&D was needed, but that the foreign patents served as an important
building block for this R&D. This paper extends that work by asking whether this additional
R&D was necessary for adoption to take place.
Another advantage of using the adoption of technology by coal-fired electric power
plants is that many operate in regulated markets, and most serve dedicated areas with little
competition. Furthermore, the choice to adopt environmental technology is driven by regulatory
pressures (Gray and Shadbegian 1998, Kerr and Newell 2003, Snyder et al. 2003). The benefit
that firms receive from adopting an environmental technology is increased compliance with
regulation. For these reasons, strategic considerations, such as first-mover advantages, are less
4

Unlike the post-combustion treatment of NOX, there was significant inventive activity in the U.S. for most new
abatement technologies, as other U.S. environmental regulations tended to be as strong, if not stronger, than those in
foreign nations.

important here than for other technologies. Thus, we can study the links between technological
advances and adoption in isolation, without concern for the more strategic stock and order effects
often considered in the literature. Doing so avoids potential multicollinearity problems between
the knowledge stocks of previous patents and stocks of previously installed capacity.
The lessons from this research should be of interest to a wide range of economists. For
environmental economists, the links between environmental policy and technological change
have become important research areas.5

For long-term problems such as climate change,

understanding the potential role that technology will play as part of any policy solution is
important. Moreover, since climate change is a global problem, understanding the flow of
environmental technologies across nations is important.6 For economists studying technological
diffusion more generally, the paper offers new empirical methodologies designed to explicitly
model the benefits of delaying adoption in return for the opportunity to adopt a better technology
in the future. It also addresses potential links between domestic R&D and knowledge spillovers.
For example, both Cohen and Levinthal (1989) and Griffith, Redding, and van Reenen (2003)
find positive links between R&D and the ability of firms to absorb knowledge spillovers.
However, these papers focus more generally on the ability of firms to absorb knowledge
spillovers, rather than on the decision to adopt new technology. Thus, this paper adds to the
discussion on the absorptive capacity of R&D by addressing one specific avenue in which
knowledge may be absorbed, via the adoption of foreign technologies.

5

Jaffe, Newell, and Stavins (2003) provide a review.
One paper that addresses this question is Lanjouw and Mody (1996). They find that many environmental patents
in developing countries come from foreign inventors, and that those patents that are granted to domestic inventors in
developing countries typically represent smaller inventive steps, such as modifying a technique to fit local
conditions. However, they look at aggregate patent data, and do not directly address the decision to adopt the
technologies in question.

I. NOX Regulations and Technology
NOX emissions are produced by the combustion of fossil fuels, when nitrogen contained
in the fuel combines with oxygen during the combustion process. NOX emissions can be reduced
either by making modifications to the combustion process or by using post-combustion control
techniques. This section reviews major legislative efforts to combat NOX emissions from power
plants, as well as the technologies used to do so.

A. Regulations7
In the United States, NOX is one of six criteria pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Acts
(CAA). However, NOX emissions were primarily seen as a local issue until the 1990 Clean Air
Act. NOX emissions results in two major environmental problems – the formation of groundlevel ozone and acid rain. As such, U.S. NOX regulations have focused on areas where these two
problems are primary concerns – California (ozone) and the eastern United States (acid rain).
For NOX, the 1970 CAA established a limit of 0.7 lbs/mmBtu of NOX for power plants. The
1977 CAA tightened the standard slightly, lowering the limit to 0.5-0.6 lbs/mmBtu.8 In addition,
removal of at least 65% of NOX emissions was required.
It was not until the 1990s that NOX regulations were strengthened, and even then the
focus was on regions of primary concern. The 1990 CAA established the Ozone Transport
Commission (OTC), designed to address the regional problem of acid rain in the eastern U.S.
The resulting plan, implemented in phases, called for reductions in affected eastern states to 0.2
lb/mmBtu beginning in May 1999, and reductions to 0.15 lb/mmBtu by May of 2003, and

(2003).

Different limits applied depending on the type of coal burnt. The higher 0.6 limit applied to bituminous coal,
which is most commonly used at U.S. coal-fired electric plants.

allowed trading of NOX emission permits across plants in the region.9 The 1998 NOX SIP Call
expanded NOX reductions to 22 eastern states, and required that emissions reductions be in place
by 2004. At the national level, the 1990 CAA tightened emission standards to as low as 0.4-0.46
lb/mmBtu by 2000.10 Unlike previous legislation, these reductions applied to both new and
existing plants.
In comparison, stringent NOX regulations have existed elsewhere as far back as the
1970s. Japanese NOX regulations have been stricter than the U.S. since the 1974 amendments to
the Air Pollution Control Law. Those amendments set a standard of 0.5 lbs/mmBtu, making
Japan’s NOX standard nearly 30% stricter than the limits in place in the U.S. at the time. These
regulations were tightened further in 1987, with a new limit of just 0.33 lbs/mmBtu. Moreover,
unlike in the U.S., where older plants are grandfathered from new emission standards, these
standards apply to both new and existing plants. Finally, Germany did not set specific limits for
NOX emissions from power plants until June 1, 1983. However, once put in place, its regulations
were stricter than either Japan or the U.S, limiting emissions to just 0.16 lbs/mmBtu.

B. Technologies to Reduce NOX Emissions
NOX emissions can be controlled via modifications to the combustion process or by
treatment of flue gas after combustion. The primary post-combustion techniques are selective
catalytic reduction (SCR) and selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR). In both processes, an
ammonia-based reagent is injected into the flue gas stream. A chemical reaction between the

Affected states are Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, and the District of Columbia.
10
This regulation was phased in, with slightly higher standards between 1996 and 1999. Also, note that the
requirements vary by plant. The standards presented apply to tangentially-fired boilers and dry bottom wall-fired
boilers respectively. These are the most common boiler types in the U.S.. Other boilers are allowed more NOX
emissions.

Adoption of NOX Control Technologies at U.S. Power Plants

NOX gases and the reagent produce nitrogen and water. SCR uses a catalyst to produce this
reaction, allowing it to work at lower temperatures than SNCR technology. SCR has a higher
capital cost than SNCR, but can reduce emissions by as much as 80-90%, compared to just 3040% reduction from SNCR technologies (Wu 2002, Afonso et al., 2000). As such, SCR is the
technology of choice for plants facing tight NOX emissions restrictions, such as in Germany and
Japan.
The complexity of retrofitting SCR on an existing plant depends on both the level of
reduction required and the quality of the coal burned. For example, higher flue gas sulfur and
ash loadings make retrofitting more difficult in Germany than Japan (Frey 1995). This also
suggests that innovations in one country need not apply to plants elsewhere.
In contrast to post-combustion techniques, combustion modification techniques are less
costly, as they do not require add-on equipment. Rather, they involve changing the combustion
process to reduce the amount of NOX formed by combustion. Typically, such modifications
work by adjusting the mix of air and fuel used in combustion, which reduces the peak flame
temperature and results in lower NOX formation. Commonly used techniques include low-NOX
burners and overfire air, in which combustion air is separated into primary and secondary flows.
These techniques reduce emissions by 30-40% from uncontrolled levels (Wu 2002, Afonso et al.
2000). Other techniques used include flue gas recirculation, in which some of the flue gas is
recirculated and mixed with combustion air, and fuel staging techniques such as reburning,
which use a secondary fuel directed at a section of the furnace to burn remaining waste gases. In
addition, different combustion techniques can be combined to achieve greater reductions (Wu
2002, Afonso et al. 2000).

II. Estimating the Determinants of Adoption
To consider the effect of knowledge on the adoption decision, we consider a coal-fired
electric plant, i, facing NOx emission regulations. In each period t, the plant must decide whether
or not to install one of two pollution abatement equipments: combustion modification (CM) or
post-combustion emission treatment (PT). Its gross profits in any given year τ, denoted giτ, are a
function of the level of regulation at time τ, Ri(τ), a vector of fixed firm characteristics Ci, and a
vector of time-varying firm characteristics Xi(τ). In addition, the effectiveness of any pollution
abatement equipment installed depends on the quality of the technology at the time in which it
was installed (period t). I use Kj(t) to represent the quality of technology at time t for technology
j, where j = CM or PT. The present value of installing technology j at time t is then:
(1)

∞

{

}

Gi , j (t ) = ∫ g i , j C i , X i ( τ ), Ri (τ ), K j (t ) e −r (τ −t ) dτ
t

Following Karshenas and Stoneman (1993), define the net present value of adoption as
Zi,j(t), where
(2)

Zi,j(t) = Gi,j(t) – Pj(t)

Here, Pj(t) represents the price of technology j at time t.
For simplicity, consider first the decision to adopt a technology for which there is no
substitute. Adoption is profitable11 if:
(3)

11

Zi,j(t) = Gi,j(t) – Pj(t) ≥ 0

Note that the model need not imply that a plant operate in an unregulated environment where only profit
maximization matters. While many plants operate in regulated environments, all that matters here is that the plant
adopts a technology if it perceives it will be better off with the technology than without. In practice, different
regulatory environments could be included as part of the variable R. However, regressions including the status of
deregulation for the plants included in this paper found that regulatory status did not affect the adoption decision.

Adoption of NOX Control Technologies at U.S. Power Plants

At the same time, adoption must meet the arbitrage condition. This states that not only is
adoption profitable today, but that it is not more profitable to postpone adoption until some
future date. Formally, this is expressed as:
(4)

yi , j (t ) =

∂Z i , j (t )e − rt
∂t

≤0

To derive an expression for y, first define p(t) as the expected change in price over time,
r(t) the expected change in regulations over time, and k(t) as the expected change in the
knowledge stock over time.12 Taking derivatives yields
(5)

∞

yi , j (t ) = rP(t ) − p(t ) − g (t ) + ∫ g (τ ) ⋅ {k (t ) + r (t )}e −r (τ −t ) dτ
t

From (3) and (5), we observe that adoption is a function of firm characteristics, current and
expected regulations and knowledge, and current and expected prices for the technology in
question. At any given time, some firms will find adoption profitable, while others will not.
Over time, we expect that adoption will become more desirable, even if other firm characteristics
remain the same, as technological advances improve the profitability of the technology. Thus,
firms for which adoption is most desirable will adopt first, while additional firms adopt as the
benefits of adoption rise. In the adoption literature, this is known as the rank effect (Karshenas
and Stoneman 1993). In these models, firm heterogeneity leads to a distribution of expected
return from adopting the new technology. From this, I define the hazard function, hi,j(t), which
captures the conditional probability that firm i will adopt technology j in time t, given that it has
not previously adopted the technology, as
(6)

hi,j(t) = f{Ci, Xi(t), Ri(t), ri(t), Kj(t), kj(t), Pj(t), pj(t)}
This approach, while similar to other models in the adoption literature, differs in that I

12

For simplicity, we assume that expectations for future firm characteristics are the same as current characteristics.
That is, firms do not anticipate future changes in operations or revenues.

Adoption of NOX Control Technologies at U.S. Power Plants

10

explicitly model the possibility of technological improvements. As in other models, only firms
above a threshold great enough to justify the costs of adoption will choose to adopt the
technology at any given time. Over time, the technology gets cheaper, and its quality improves,
so that more firms cross the adoption threshold. However, this decrease is typically modeled
exogenously.13 In the empirical work that follows, I use instrumental variables to control for the
endogenous links between innovation and regulation.14
Now, consider a plant that can choose between either of the two technology options. In
addition to the profitability and no arbitrage conditions (equations (3) and (5)), it must also be
the case that it is more profitable to adopt technology j than the competing technology, l. For
example, using data on the adoption of multiple machine tool technologies, Stoneman and Kwon
(1994) and Stoneman and Toivanen (1997) find significant cross-technology effects – changes in
the price of one technology affect adoption rates for both technologies. In addition, since a plant
may decide against investment in technology j if it anticipates major advances in the competing
technology, the arbitrage condition should include expectations for both technologies. From
equation (6), note that only prices and knowledge are technology-specific. Thus, to know
whether technology j is more profitable than technology l, we must also consider knowledge and
prices for technology l. When faced with competing technologies the adoption decision is:
13

Ireland and Stoneman (1986) provide a theoretical example of such a model. They consider both supply and
demand of a new technology, and consider how adoption changes when expectations over future prices occur.
However, costs fall exogenously over time, and improvements in the quality of technology are only considered
implicitly, by assuming prices to be quality-adjusted. Similarly, Tsur et al. (1990) use the possibility of learning by
using to model the evolution of technology. Modeling technological progress via learning by using leads to opposite
conclusions about timing. If experience is necessary to improve the technology, firms may find it beneficial to
adopt technologies that result in short-term losses in hopes of long-term benefits. Here, firms may decide to
postpone adopting beneficial technologies if future benefits, due to technological progress, will be even greater.
14
As noted earlier, models of adoption often explore stock effects and order effects, in addition to rank effects. Both
are related to the cumulative number of adopters in an industry. Both address strategic advantages early adopters
receive. Given that most electric plants face little competition, and many operate as natural monopolies in a
regulated market, such strategic effects are likely to be unimportant in this study. However, for other applications,
the model can be generalized to include stock and order effects by including variables relating to the number of
adopters, as in Karshenas and Stoneman (1993).

A. An Econometric Model
Empirical studies of technology adoption have traditionally used one of two approaches.
The epidemic model of diffusion proposes that information is the primary factor limiting
diffusion. Adoption is slow at first, as few people (or firms) know about the technology.
However, as more people adopt the technology, knowledge of the technology spreads quickly,
leading to a period of rapid adoption. Economists often use the analogy of a contagious disease
to describe this period of adoption – the more people “infected” by the technology, the more
likely that others will also be “infected”. Eventually, few potential adopters remain, as nearly
everyone has adopted the technology, so that the rate of adoption levels off again. Using this
framework, Griliches (1957) noted that the rate of diffusion is at least partially determined by
economic factors, such as the expected rate of return for adoption. Other work using the
epidemic model, such as Mansfield (1968), Davies (1979), and Oster (1982), typically focus on
firm characteristics, such as firm size, to explain variations in the rate of diffusion. The second
approach to studying diffusion is the probit model (David 1969), which focuses on heterogeneity
among firms. These models are the basis for the rank effects described above.
Recent work on diffusion use duration models to combine features of both of these earlier
methods (e.g. Hannan and McDowell 1984, Rose and Joskow 1990, Karshenas and Stoneman
1993, Kerr and Newell 2003, Snyder et al. 2003). These models begin with the hazard function,
which can be written as:
(8)

h(t , Xt , β ) =

f (t , Xt , β )
1 − F (t , Xt , β )

Adoption of NOX Control Technologies at U.S. Power Plants

12

Here, f is the continuous probability function of a random variable (such as the time to adoption),
F is the cumulative probability function of this variable, Xt is a vector of explanatory variables, β
is the vector of parameters to be estimated, and t represents time. Thus, like the probit model,
adoption depends on individual firm characteristics captured by Xt. By separating the hazard
function into two parts, Karshenas and Stoneman (1993) combine features of the epidemic model
with the hazard model by including a baseline hazard function, h0(t), that does not vary by firm.
Combining the baseline hazard function with a hazard model that varies by firm characteristics
yields a hazard function to be estimated of the form:
(9)

h(t,Xt,β) = h0(t)exp(Xt′β).
To estimate equation (9), the baseline hazard h0 must be specified. Various specifications

have been used in the adoption literature.

Among the most common are the exponential,

Weibull, and Gompertz distributions. The exponential distribution assumes the baseline hazard
is constant over time, whereas the others assume that the baseline hazard is a function of time.
Thus, the exponential distribution assumes that learning effects are insignificant. In the results
that follow, the exponential distribution is used.15
Once the baseline hazard is specified, estimation of equation (9) is completed using
duration data techniques.16 Of particular importance is that, since not every observation ends in
a decision to adopt, the data are censored. That is, we either observe that a plant adopts the
technology, and thus leaves the data, or survives through the data period without adopting. We
15

I also estimated models using the Weibull and Gompertz distributions. Both the signs and magnitudes of the
knowledge variables change dramatically (and have unrealistic magnitudes) under these specifications, and the
models do not always converge, suggesting that collinearity between the stocks, which grow over time, and the
baseline hazard is a problem when the baseline hazard is a function of time. The results for variables other than
knowledge are unchanged, and remain unchanged even if the knowledge stocks are omitted. Given that the
technologies discussed have been well-known for some time, the assumption that learning effects are small seems
reasonable. The key assumption of such a model is that the remaining explanatory variables capture any timevarying incentives to adopt. In similar work, Kerr and Newell (2003) find learning effects to be insignificant for the
adoption of isomerization technologies by oil refineries during the U.S. phasedown of leaded gasoline.
16
For an introduction to duration data see Cox and Oakes (1985), Kiefer (1988), and Lancaster (1990).

Adoption of NOX Control Technologies at U.S. Power Plants

13

do not know, however, whether the plant will choose to adopt at some future point. Thus, the
likelihood function used considers both adopters (denoted by α) and non adopters (denoted by 1-

α) as follows:
L(β) = f (t ; X, β )α (1 − F (t ; X, β ))1−α

(10)

A plant contributes to the likelihood function in each year prior to adoption via 1-α, and during
the year of adoption through α. After a plant adopts, it is dropped from the data.
Equation (7) suggests the variables to include in Xt. However, some modifications are
necessary due to data constraints.

Most importantly, the data set used does not contain

information on the cost of technology, so that Pj is not observed directly. Instead, as I discuss in
section III, the costs of NOX control technologies are plant specific. Thus, plant characteristics
help to control for variations in cost. Moreover, I assume that cost changes over time result from
changes in technology, so that the effects of cost changes over time are picked up by the
knowledge variables. Finally, since expectations of future knowledge are not observed, I use the
current growth rate in knowledge as a proxy.17

III. Data
A. Constructing the Knowledge Stocks
The main contribution of this paper is to add knowledge stocks to the traditional
empirical models of technology adoption. To construct these stocks, I use counts of patents
granted in the United States. Economists have found that patents, sorted by their date of
application, provide a good indicator of R&D activity (see, for example, Griliches 1990). Unlike
17

While other work including expectations, such as Karshenas and Stoneman (1993) use the change between current
and future variables to proxy for expectations, doing so here is not possible without removing the last year of data
from the regressions. Since much of the adoption of NOX combustion treatment technologies occurs at the end of
the sample, this is undesirable.

Adoption of NOX Control Technologies at U.S. Power Plants

14

R&D data, patent counts are available in highly aggregated form. This makes it possible to
distinguish between advances in combustion modification and post-combustion techniques. In
addition, historical records of patent data are available for longer periods than R&D data, making
it possible to construct a complete history of the development of these technologies. Popp
(2005) discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using patent data when studying
environmental technologies.18
When patents are granted, they are given technology classifications and subclassifications
by various patent offices. These classifications can be used to identify patents pertaining to each
of the technologies described in section I. Relevant patents were identified using the European
Classification System (ECLA).19 Using esp@cenet, the EPO’s on-line database, I obtained a list
of all patent numbers in relevant technology classes granted in the U.S. since 1920. I construct
separate list of patents for combustion modification technologies and post-combustion treatment
technologies.20 Appendix B lists the technology classifications used and their definitions. I
merged these patent numbers with additional data from Delphion’s on-line database and the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) website to obtain descriptive data on these patents, such
as the country of origin and their application date. All patents assigned to U.S. inventors are

18

Among the disadvantages, note that not all successful innovations are patented, as inventors may choose to forgo
patent protection to avoid disclosing proprietary information. Levin et al (1987) report significant differences in the
propensity to patent across industries. Fortunately, this is less problematic when studying the development of a
single technology than when using patents to study inventive activity across technologies, as the only assumption
needed is that the propensity to patent within the industry has remained similar. Moreover, note that the quality of
individual patents vary greatly. Thus, the results of this paper are best interpreted as the average effect of all
accumulated knowledge, rather than the effect of any specific invention.

The ECLA is based upon the well-known International Patent Classification system (IPC), but provides additional
detail necessary to distinguish between the types of pollution controlled by various technologies. For example, IPC
classification B01D 53/86 includes catalytic processes for pollution control. ECLA class B01D 53/86F2 specifies
catalytic processes for reduction of NOX, and B01D 53/86B4 specifies catalytic processes for reduction of SO2.
Moreover, as new classifications are added, the European Patent Office (EPO) updates the ECLA of older patents in
its database. This is important, as classifications distinguishing pollution control techniques for specific pollutants
were not added until recently.

considered domestic, and all others are considered foreign patents. Figure 1 shows U.S. and
foreign patent applications for each technology. Of particular importance, note that foreign postcombustion treatment patents peak in the mid-1970s, after passage of NOX regulations in Japan,
and again in the mid 1980s, after passage of even more stringent NOX regulations in Germany.
As is traditional in research using patent data, I sort patents by their application year.
Using the application year avoids differences in the length of time it takes to process a patent
application, which varies both over time and across inventors from different countries.
Moreover, the application year tends to corresponds with the date actual inventive activity (see,
for example, Griliches 1990). Because patents were only published in the U.S. upon grant until
2001, no public record exists of unsuccessful U.S. patent applications. Thus, the data only
include patent applications that were subsequently granted. Since many recent applications have
yet to be granted, data for later year are scaled to avoid truncation problems.21
Using these patent data, I create separate stocks of knowledge for combustion
modification and post-combustion technologies. Within each field, I create separate stocks of
foreign and domestic patents.

I use a rate of decay, represented by β1, to capture the

obsolescence of older patent and a rate of diffusion, β2, to capture delays in the flow of
knowledge. Defining s as the number of years before the current year, the stock of knowledge at
time t for technology j is written as:
(11)

21

K j ,t =

∞

∑ e −β ( s) (1 − e −β ( s+1) ) PAT j ,t −s .
1

2

s =0

I do this by first calculating the average grant lag for patents in the data set. Separate scales are created for foreign
and domestic patents. From this, I estimate the percentage of pending patents for each year, and augment the data
by this percentage. This scaling is only significant for patents from 2001 and 2002. However, as we will see below,
these patents receive little weight in the knowledge stocks, as their diffusion process is just beginning.

Adoption of NOX Control Technologies at U.S. Power Plants

16

The rate of diffusion is multiplied by s+1 so that diffusion is not constrained to be zero in the
current period.

To check whether domestic R&D is needed before adopting foreign

technologies, I also create a stock of patents that interacts domestic patents with foreign
knowledge:
K INT

(12)

=

∞

∑ e −β ( s) (1 − e −β ( s+1) ) PAT jUS,t −s ⋅ K Fj ,t −s−1 .

s =0

The base results presented below use a decay rate of 0.1, and a rate of diffusion of 0.25 for each
stock calculation.22 In previous work, I have used similar knowledge stocks to estimate the
effect of energy-saving technology on industrial energy consumption (Popp 2001) and to
estimate the effect of sulfur dioxide scrubber technology on coal-fired electric plants (Popp
2003).

B. Power Plant Data
Data on individual power plants comes from the Energy Information Administration
(EIA), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and Compustat. I use the results of
an EIA survey of power plants, EIA Form 767, to get information on plant characteristics. This
survey includes data on fuel usage, electricity production, NOX emissions standards, and
pollution control equipment. The survey asks which techniques, if any, have been adopted to
reduce NOX emissions, and lists 11 possible technologies that may be used. Of these, nine
qualify as combustion modification, and two are post-combustion techniques (SCR and SNCR).
In addition to plant characteristics, several studies of diffusion suggest that financial

22

These rates are consistent with others used in the R&D literature. For example, discussing the literature on an
appropriate lag structure for R&D capital, Griliches (1995) notes that previous studies suggest a structure peaking
between 3 and 5 years. The rates of decay and diffusion used in this paper provide a lag peaking after 4 years.
Appendix A presents sensitivity analysis with respect to the rates of decay and diffusion.

Adoption of NOX Control Technologies at U.S. Power Plants

17

characteristics of the firm matter. As such, I augment the data from EIA Form 767 with financial
data on individual plants. FERC Form 1 provides this data for plants owned by regulated electric
utilities. EIA Form 412 provides financial data for municipal, federally-owned, and unregulated
entities. Finally, because of shifts in ownership due to deregulation, data from Compustat are
used to obtain financial data of the parent companies for plants owned by private corporations,
such as Entergy or Duke Energy Corporation. The final unit of analysis is individual boilers
within a plant. Each plant contains multiple boilers. These boilers are often of different vintages
and may face different regulations, so that adoption of pollution abatement equipment is not
uniform across boilers at a specific plant. The resulting data set includes observations for 996
coal-fired power plant boilers from 1990-2002.
Table 1 provides descriptive data for the variables used in the regressions. Two dummy
variables indicate whether a boiler has either combustion modification or post-combustion
treatment technologies to reduce NOX emissions. Figure 2 shows the percentage of boilers with
each technology by year. The first panel shows overall trends, and the remaining panels separate
the data by states that are part of the OTC and NOX SIP call. Note that the percentage of boilers
with combustion modification technologies grows steadily over the period analyzed, from 16
percent in 1990 to 76 percent in 2002.

In comparison, no post-combustion treatment

technologies were adopted until 1992. Most adoption occurs in recent years, as a result of recent
increases in regulatory stringency. This does not simply represent a switch from one technology
to the other, as adoptions of combustion modification technologies also increase at this time. In
fact, about half of the post-combustion installations occur at boilers also using combustion
modification (Popp 2006).

Overall, fewer than 10 percent of boilers use post-combustion

treatment. Usage of post-combustion technologies is greatest in OTC states, where 23 percent of

Adoption of NOX Control Technologies at U.S. Power Plants

18

boilers use the technology by 2002. However, there is some adoption of post-combustion
technologies in other states, with 5 percent using post-combustion techniques in SIP states, and 2
percent in states that are neither OTC or SIP states.23
Descriptive data for the knowledge stocks shows how the value of the stocks faced by
any firm varies throughout the sample period (1990-2002). While mean values of the stocks of
post-combustion patents are higher than for combustion modification, levels across technologies
are not directly comparable, as the number of patents depends on the number of relevant patent
classifications for each technology. Of greater importance is that foreign stocks are, on average,
larger than domestic stocks for post-combustion treatment, but smaller than domestic stocks for
combustion modification. Figure 3 presents the trends in these stocks over time. Finally, to
control for expectations of future knowledge stocks, I include a variable for the growth rate of
each stock, defined as (Kt – Kt-1)/Kt-1. Average growth rates range from 2.8 to 7.7 percent,
depending on the technology and source of the innovation.
Of the other explanatory variables, perhaps most important are those variables measuring
regulatory levels.

Previous studies of diffusion of environmental technologies show that

regulatory stringency matters (Gray and Shadbegian 1998, Kerr and Newell 2003, Snyder et al.,
2003). Since NOX emissions technologies provide no benefit to the plant other than reducing
emissions, they are of little use unless a boiler is required to reduce NOX emissions. Moreover,
since post-combustion techniques reduce a greater percentage of emissions, but cost more than
combustion modification techniques, the technology chosen should vary depending on regulatory
stringency.
23

Note that while most plants do install one of these techniques to comply with regulations, EPA rules allow utilities
additional options to comply with federal standards. First, a plant may average the emission rates of two or more
boilers. In the data, this most often appears as older vintage boilers being less likely to use any NOX reduction
techniques. Second, plants can apply for less stringent emission standards if the plant can demonstrate that it
wouldn’t meet the emissions limit using standard NOX reduction techniques (EIA, 1997).

Adoption of NOX Control Technologies at U.S. Power Plants

19

Note that boilers may face regulations at federal, state, and local levels. Form 767
includes the level of the most stringent of these regulations.24 Because standards from various
jurisdictions vary in the units by which they are defined, I include dummy variables for the
presence of three types of regulations. Most common are regulations specifying a maximum
level of NOX emissions per million Btus of fuel burned (lbs/mmBTU). Nearly half of all boileryear observations in the sample face such a limit. Other regulation types include pounds per
hour of service (lb/hour) and parts per million of NOX at the stack (ppm at stack). Because each
regulation type has different levels, each regulation type enters the regression separately. In
addition, I create a dummy variable for boilers affected by either the OTC regulations or the
1998 NOX SIP call. In both cases, such boilers face the expectations of tighter regulations in the
future. Thus, boilers facing the need to install new abatement equipment now might invest in
better equipment in anticipation of forthcoming stringent regulations. In addition, recall that
OTC boilers face more stringent regulations during the summer months, beginning in 1999.25,26
Boiler characteristics considered include details about the boiler and the plant owner’s
finances. Whereas many studies of diffusion include the price of a technology as an explanatory
variable, here costs vary by boiler. Boiler characteristics help to determine the cost of NOX
reduction strategies. For example, coals with higher sulfur content reduce the service life of
catalysts used in SCR units, making SCR more costly for boilers that use high-sulfur coal. As a
result, most SCR units worldwide have been used at boilers burning coal with less than two
percent sulfur content (Wu 2002). Costs also increase with boiler size. To control for the type of
24

This is important, as it provides variation in the regulations faced by similar boilers in different jurisdictions at a
given point in time.
25
The OTC standards only apply between May 1 and September 30. As such, they are not included as the standards
reported in the EIA Form 767 database. However, as these (typically) more stringent standards will be relevant for
the adoption decision of boilers, I replace the standard reported in the Form 767 database with the OTC standard if
the OTC standard is more stringent.
26
While it was part of the OTC commission, Maryland did not join the agreement to reduce emissions until 2000.
As such, the OTC dummy equals 0 for Maryland in 1999.

Adoption of NOX Control Technologies at U.S. Power Plants

20

boiler used, I include a dummy variable for boilers that use tangential firing.27 I also include
dummy variables for the boiler’s vintage. Vintage is defined based on the year in which the
boiler began service. The vintage dummies control both for the age of the boiler and for any
differences in the construction of boilers from a given era that might affect retrofit costs.28
Much empirical work on diffusion suggests that firm size is an important influence.
Larger firms have better access to credit and are more likely to be able to afford larger, riskier
investments. As a measure of the plant owner’s finances, I use annual operating revenues of the
plant’s parent utility. After deregulation, ownership of some plants shifts to unregulated entities.
To control for this, I create a dummy variable equal to one if the plant owner’s information
comes from the Compustat database, which is the only database to include unregulated entities.
Because the other databases specifically report operating revenues for electricity generation,
while the Compustat database includes revenues from all sources of diversified companies, the
scale of revenues is different for plants in the Compustat database. Thus, I also interact the
Compustat dummy with revenues. Finally, since the exponential distribution of the hazard
assumes no other learning, it is important to control for any other learning that may take place.
An important source of learning is within-firm experience. Utilities that have experience with a
specific device at other plants may be more likely to install it elsewhere. To control for this, I
define utility experience as the total number of boilers owned by a utility using each technology
in the previous year.

27

Most U.S. boilers use either tangential-fired or wall-fired boilers. Retrofit costs are higher for tangential-fired
boilers (Wu 2002).
28
The vintage dummy variables are generally defined in five year intervals, with exceptions for the youngest and
oldest plants, as shown in Tables 2, 3, 5, & 6.

Adoption of NOX Control Technologies at U.S. Power Plants

21

IV. Estimation
Using the data described above, I proceed with estimation of the hazard function. I
estimate separate equations for adoption of each technology. To begin, define the following
variables. Ci is a vector of time-invariant boiler characteristics, Xi(t) is a vector of time-varying
boiler characteristics, di,r(t) is a dummy variable equal to one if a boiler has regulation type r at
time (t), Ri,r(t) is the level of regulation type r faced by plant i at time t. OTCi(t) and SIPi(t) are
dummy variables equal to one if the boiler is affected by OTC or SIP regulations. K(t) represents
the respective knowledge stocks for each technology, and k(t) is the growth in each knowledge
stock. The index s below represents the source of knowledge: domestic or foreign. HASCMi(t-1)
and HASPTi(t-1) are dummy variables equal to one if the boiler used the other technology option
in the previous year. These dummies control for the fact that adoption of post-combustion
treatment is less likely for a boiler that already has combustion modification (and vice versa).29
Using these variables, the two hazard functions are:
(13)

hi,CM(t) = f{Ci, Xi(t), di,r(t)Ri,r(t), dr(t), OTCi(t), SIPi(t), KSCM(t), kSCM(t),
KSPT(t), kSPT(t), HASPTii(t-1)}

(14)

hi,PT(t) = f{Ci, Xi(t), di,r(t)Ri,r(t), dr(t), OTCi(t), SIPi(t), KSPT(t), kSPT(t),
KSCM(t), kSCM(t), HASCMii(t-1)}

As in Kerr and Newell (2003), I normalize all continuous variables so that a one unit change in
the normalized variable is equivalent to a ten percent change from its mean value, so as to aid
interpretation of the effects on the hazard function.30 Because the regressions include repeated
observations on individual boilers, it is unlikely that the error terms are independently and
29

Although combustion modification techniques do not achieve reductions necessary to meet the most stringent
regulations in isolation, a boiler with existing combustion modification techniques may choose to add a second
combustion modification technique. In combination, these technologies achieve emission reductions comparable to
post-combustion treatment techniques (Wu 2001).
30
The normalization first divides each continuous variable by its mean, multiplies by 10, and then takes deviations
from the mean by subtracting 10. As in Kerr and Newell (2003), this results in normalized variables that have a
mean of 0. Note that because company experience is a count variable (with many zeros for post combustion
technology), it is not normalized in this fashion.

Adoption of NOX Control Technologies at U.S. Power Plants

22

identically distributed. As such, robust standard errors are calculated using the Huber/White
correction.
Before proceeding, two econometric issues need to be addressed. Most importantly, note
that the domestic knowledge stocks are likely endogenous, as they are influenced by the
stringency of U.S. NOX regulations.31 To control for this, I use a two-stage procedure. For
patents applied for between 1990 and 2002, I regress patent applications on federal NOX
emission standards, a dummy for the years in which OTC regulations are in force, lagged values
of the foreign knowledge stock, and a time trend. I then use the predicted values in place of
actual patent counts from 1990-2002 when constructing the stocks.
Second, note that some boilers adopted combustion modification techniques before the
first year of data availability.

In fact, the first boiler to install combustion modification

techniques in the U.S. did so in 1974. Thus, the likelihood function must control for boilers that
adopt early (that is, that do not survive until 1990) (Cox and Oakes 1985). This adds an
additional term to the likelihood function used to estimate the hazard function for combustion
modification:
(15)

L(β) = f (t ; X, β)α (1 − F (t ; X, β))1−α F (0; X, β) γ

Here, α equals 1 for boilers that adopt in year t, conditional on not adopting before. γ
equals 1 for boilers that adopted combustion modification technologies before 1990, and 0
otherwise. Boilers that did not adopt before 1990 contribute to the likelihood function in each
year prior to adoption via 1-α, and during the year of adoption through α. Boilers that did adopt
prior to 1990 contribute through γ. After a boiler adopts, it is dropped from the data.32

31

Note that Popp (2006) shows that the same is not true for foreign patents for NOX control technologies.
The term F(0;X,β)γ is not needed for post-combustion technology, as the first adoption occurs in 1993. Thus, the
likelihood function described in equation (10) is used for post-combustion technology.

32

Adoption of NOX Control Technologies at U.S. Power Plants

23

A. Adoption of Combustion Modification Techniques
Tables 2 and 3 present regression results for combustion modification technology. The
tables present estimated coefficients from the maximum likelihood regression. To interpret these
coefficients, note that the effect of the hazard ratio for each coefficient is calculated as exp(β).
Table 2 begins with a naïve model, which assumes myopic adoption decisions and ignores the
availability of competing technology. This model, presented in column 1, ignores knowledge
stocks for post-combustion technology and growth in either technology’s knowledge stocks. In
column 2, I consider expectations by adding the growth of combustion modification technology
knowledge. Columns 3 and 4 consider the interaction between domestic and foreign knowledge,
as defined by equation (12), both with and without the growth variables.
The results suggest that available knowledge has just a small effect on the adoption of
combustion modification techniques. In all cases, a likelihood ratio test of the joint significance
of the knowledge variables rejects the null hypothesis that these coefficients are zero. However,
the magnitude of the effect of knowledge is small. In the base model, both domestic and foreign
technologies have a statistically significant effect on adoption. However, these effects tend to
offset each other, so that the net effect of technology is near zero. While a 10 percent increase in
the stock of domestic knowledge raises the hazard rate by 51 percent, a 10 percent increase in the
stock of foreign knowledge lowers the hazard rate by 43 percent. As expected, expectations of
future technology advances, proxied by the growth rates of knowledge, negatively influence
adoption, although the effect is only significant for domestic knowledge, and only at the ten
percent level. The interaction terms (columns 3 & 4) are significantly positive, and the net effect
of both domestic knowledge is positive.

24

Adoption of NOX Control Technologies at U.S. Power Plants
Table 3 presents results that consider the availability of both technologies.

Here,

however, one adjustment must be made. When including both foreign and domestic stocks of
each technology, multicollinearity is a problem. Thus, in Table 3, only a combined stock,
including both foreign and domestic patents, is used for each technology. Column 1 repeats the
naïve model with just the one knowledge stock. Here, knowledge has almost no effect on
adoption, as the coefficient is insignificant, and the increase in the hazard rate from a ten percent
increase in knowledge is just 1 percent. Adding expectations to the model in column 2, we get
the surprising result that expectations of future technological gains increase the hazard rate. In
addition, the level of knowledge now has a significant positive effect, with a ten percent increase
raising the probability of adoption by 12 percent. Column 3 considers stocks of both combustion
modification and post-combustion treatment. Here, the signs are the reverse of expectations:
increased knowledge for the competing technology encourages more adoption, while increased
combustion modification knowledge decreases adoption. However, the results of column 4
suggest these unexpected results come from a misspecified model. Most importantly, once both
technologies and expectations are considered, both the level and growth of the competing NOX
technology have a negative effect on adoption. In contrast, the level of combustion modification
knowledge has no effect on adoption. This suggests that combustion modification serves as a
“default” technology for firms that must adopt pollution control technology.

Once better

alternatives are available, the likelihood of adopting combustion modification falls.33
To help put these results in perspective, it is useful to consider the combined effect of
increases in knowledge during this time frame. Table 4 shows such calculations. The table
presents the average increase in the adoption probability resulting from new knowledge in each
33

However, it is still the case that expectations of future growth in combustion modification technology increase
adoption. Since the level of technology itself does not affect adoption, this may suggest that expectations capture
expectations of other variables that might influence adoption.

25

Adoption of NOX Control Technologies at U.S. Power Plants

year for both combustion modification and post combustion technologies.34 For combustion
modification technologies, note that the average net impact of knowledge ranges from just a
0.07% increase to a 3.26% decrease in the likelihood of adoption. In some models, particularly
those without the competing technology, knowledge does have a larger impact in the beginning
of the sample, at which time patent counts for these technologies were highest.
Turing to other variables, the results are as expected. Moreover, the results for other
variables are consistent across specifications. By far the most important predictor of adoption is
regulatory stringency. Boilers subject to OTC or SIP regulations are twice as likely to adopt
combustion modification technology. Similarly, the presence of lb/mmBTU regulation increases
adoption by a factor of six.35 Note also the negative sign for regulatory levels – adoption is more
likely when fewer emissions are allowed. However, this effect is small. A ten percent more
stringent than average regulation never increases the likelihood of adoption by more than two
percent. That the simple presence of regulation is more important than the level is important
because combustion modification is of less use when regulations are very stringent. Thus, tighter
regulations need not induce additional adoption.
Turning to boiler characteristics, boilers that already have post-combustion treatment are
seventy percent less likely to adopt combustion modification. This is not surprising, as postcombustion treatment is both more effective and more expensive. Plants are unlikely to invest in
such technology if it is insufficient to meet regulatory hurdles.

Company experience is

important. For each additional existing boiler with a combustion modification unit operated by
the utility, the likelihood of adoption at a different boiler increases by four percent. As for other

34

The calculation is the average of exp(X(t)’β) – exp(X(t-1)’β ), where X is a vector of the relevant technology
variables in each model (including the growth rates), and β is the vector of coefficients.
35
Results for other types of regulations are similar. Because these affect fewer boilers, they are omitted from the
table to conserve space.

Adoption of NOX Control Technologies at U.S. Power Plants

26

characteristics, boiler size, sulfur content of coal, and the vintage dummies are significant.
Larger boilers are more likely to adopt combustion modification techniques. In addition, the
probability of adoption generally rises in later vintage years, although it is smallest for boilers
established sine 1996. As shown in the next section, these very new boilers make less use of
combustion modification because they instead install post combustion techniques, which are
state of the art at the time these newest boilers are built. Of particular importance is that all
financial variables are insignificant.

As I discuss with the results for post-combustion

techniques, it is unlikely that this result occurs because many utilities operate in regulated
markets, but rather because it is regulatory pressure that provides the initial impetus for adoption.
Once faced with regulation, plants do not have the option to delay option until conditions are
more favorably financially.

B. Adoption of Post-Combustion Treatment
Tables 5 and 6 present the results of estimation for post-combustion treatment
technologies.

Once again, Table 5 ignores the availability of competing technology, but

considers both foreign and domestic sources of knowledge separately. Here, some interesting
patterns emerge. Domestic knowledge is insignificant in each model presented in Table 5, and
foreign knowledge is only significant in columns 2 and 4. However, except in column 1, the
joint effect of all knowledge variables is significant (although only at 7 percent in column 3). In
column 3, note that interaction term is strongly significant, and that the net effect of domestic
knowledge is positive in this model. Recall that NOX post-combustion techniques were first
developed and installed abroad. These results suggest that developments made abroad are
important to potential U.S. adopters, but that domestic R&D is necessary to adapt foreign

Adoption of NOX Control Technologies at U.S. Power Plants

27

innovations to the U.S. market. This is consistent with results in Popp (2006), which shows that
U.S. post-combustion patents are much more likely to cite foreign patents than other U.S.
pollution control patents, suggesting that these post-combustion patents primarily serve to build
upon foreign innovations. While similar results are also found in the more complete model in
column 4, multicollinearity is a problem. Although the net effect of knowledge is not much
greater for this model (as shown in Table 4), the magnitude of the individual coefficients varies
widely.
Table 6 presents results for a single knowledge stock for each of the two competing
technologies.

Results are generally as expected, although the results are not as statically

significant as the combustion modification results, as the lower adoption rates result in less
variation in the data. Note also that the joint effect of knowledge is less significant when using
the combined knowledge stock, suggesting that the capturing the variation in the timing of
foreign and domestic knowledge, as in Table 5, is important. Referring to the likelihood ratio
tests at the bottom of Table 6, the joint effect of all knowledge variables is significant at the 10
percent level in columns 1, 2, and 4.36 The combined post-combustion stock increases adoption,
with a 10 percent increase from average levels increasing adoption by 60 percent. Moreover,
expectations of technological advances (column 2) delay adoption. As before, the sign on the
competing knowledge stock in column 3 is reverse of expectations, although insignificant.
However, this problem disappears in the completely specified model in column 4, which
considers both technological alternatives and expectations. Here, advances in post-combustion

36

That the t-statistic on knowledge in column 1 suggests that the knowledge variable is significant at the five
percent level, while the likelihood ratio test suggests that it is only significant at the 10 percent level, results from
the robustness correction of the standard errors. Because the knowledge variables change over time, but not across
boilers, the robustness correction provides slightly overoptimistic standard errors for the knowledge variables.
In contrast, the log-likelihood statistics, and hence the likelihood ratio tests, are not affected by the robustness
correction.

Adoption of NOX Control Technologies at U.S. Power Plants

28

technology increase adoption, and advances in combustion modification technology decrease
adoption.

Expected advances in either technology delay adoption, although the effect is

insignificant.
Finally, note that, compared to combustion modification techniques, knowledge plays a
more important role for post combustion techniques, as shown in Table 4. In the naïve models
(column 1 in each table), technological progress increases adoption by 9 percent each year. This
percentage increases to over 20% in the more complete models.37 In contrast, new knowledge
only increased combustion modification adoption rates by less than one percent per year. The
importance of technological progress for the newer post-combustion technology, but not for the
more established combustion modification techniques, suggest that a competing technology must
evolve sufficiently before plants will choose it over a well-established technology.38
Turning to other variables, note that once again the coefficients on other variables are
consistent across models. There are, however, several differences between technologies. First,
whether a boiler has or does not have existing combustion modification technologies has no
effect on the adoption of post-combustion control. Indeed, post-combustion techniques can be
paired with combustion modification techniques to increase effectiveness, which may be
necessary to meet strict emissions standards. Moreover, the costs of SCR systems are lower
when combined with combustion modification, as less catalyst is needed if the remaining NOX
concentrations to be removed are lower (Wu 2002). Thus, boilers that had previously installed
combustion modification (perhaps to comply with earlier, less stringent regulations) may still
choose to add a post-combustion device as regulations become stronger. This result suggests an
37

While the percentage is even higher in the models including growth rates for foreign and domestic knowledge,
large changes in the magnitudes of key parameters in these models suggest multicollinearlity problems.
38
Lissoni (2000) provides a theoretical model supporting such a conclusion. His paper presents both a theoretical
model and a case study of electronic color pre-press printing equipment that firms may choose older “intermediate”
technologies if new cutting edge technologies do not provide sufficient advantages.

Adoption of NOX Control Technologies at U.S. Power Plants

29

important lesson for new technologies: to avoid lock-in when developing a new, otherwise
superior technology, it may be helpful to work with existing technologies, rather than simply
serving as a substitute.
Note that by far the most important of the regulatory variables are the dummy variables
indicating boilers covered by OTC regulations. Boilers affected by OTC regulations are 25-40
times more likely to install post-combustion treatment, and boilers subject to the NOX SIP call
are generally about six times more likely to install post-combustion treatment. This reflects both
the increased stringency required in OTC states beginning in 1999, and expectations of future,
more stringent regulations, as OTC rules specified that NOX standards would be further tightened
in 2003, and the NOX SIP call included stringent regulations beginning in 2004. As a result of
the strong effect of these variables, the effect of other regulations is insignificant.39,40
Finally, I consider the effect of other boiler characteristics. Company experience is
significant in half of the specifications. Additional experience with post combustion technology
within the parent utility increases the likelihood of adoption by 22 to 36%. Interestingly, the
vintage effects are non-linear. While the oldest boilers are less likely to adopt, the boilers most
likely to adopt post combustion technique are those brought on line during the 1970s or 1990s.
While the increase in the 1990s is likely attributable to technological change, it is more likely
that the increase for boilers from the 1970s stems from the lack of emissions equipment that
would have been in place on these boilers. As such, they may need more advanced technologies
to come into compliance with new NOX regulations. Unlike combustion modification, boilers

39

Once again, results for other types of regulations are omitted to save space, as these affect few plants. The one
exception to insignificant results is a strong negative effect on “has lb/hour reg,” which is driven by the few boilers
(just 17, representing 157 observations) that have such regulations. Only one boiler adopts post combustion
technology while facing such regulations, and it is also affected by the NOX SIP call when it does.
40
Other regulatory variables do have significant effects if the OTC and SIP dummy variables are dropped from the

Adoption of NOX Control Technologies at U.S. Power Plants
that use tangential firing are less likely to adopt post-combustion treatment.

Because of the

large installation costs of post-combustion treatment, the financial strength of plant owners is
also important. A 10 percent increase in revenue increases the hazard rate by about 4 percent.41
In comparison, recall that adoption of combustion modification techniques was not sensitive to
revenue.

Financial strength gives firms the option to invest in better technology, but all

regulated firms must invest in some technology. This is similar to results in Rose and Joskow
(1990), who find that firm size is more important for the adoption of more advanced supercritical
boilers than more conventional units.

V. Conclusions
This paper examines the adoption of two separate NOX pollution control technologies by
boilers at coal-fired power plants: combustion modification and post-combustion treatment of
emissions. As in previous work on the adoption of environmental technologies, I find that
regulations are the driving force behind adoption. This paper extends the existing literature on
adoption by considering competing technologies and by considering the role of available
knowledge in the adoption decision.
Of the two technologies considered, combustion modification is cheaper and more wellestablished in the U.S. However, it is not as effective as reducing emissions as post-combustion
treatment. Because U.S. NOX regulations only recently caught up with countries such as Japan
and Germany, combustion modification has been the technique of choice in the U.S.

In

comparison, much early innovation on post-combustion treatment was completed in Japan and
Germany. I find that, even after controlling for increased regulatory stringency over time,

41

The negative interaction with the Compustat dummy simply controls for larger revenue levels of these plant
owners, who are large, diversified energy corporations, rather than dedicated electric utilities.

advances in post-combustion technology lead to increased likelihood of adoption. Moreover,
while advances from abroad are important, domestic R&D to adapt foreign innovations is
required. There is some evidence that expectations of future advances slow adoption, although
not all expectation variables are statistically significant. In comparison, because combustion
modification serves as a “default” technology, the state of its available knowledge has little
effect on adoption of combustion modification techniques.
While the results linking adoption and technological progress should be of interest to a
wide range of economists, the paper also offers additional lessons specific to the field of
environmental economics. In particular, while much attention has been recently paid to links
between environmental policy and technological change, this study suggests two limitations to
the ability of technological change to act as a panacea. First, note that even when a more
advanced technology is available, it will not diffuse without regulatory incentives to do so. For
those concerned with environmental problems in developing problems, this suggests that
diffusion of environmental technology is not independent from the problem of diffusion of
environmental regulations themselves.42 Second, it suggests that technologies developed in one
country may not diffuse to additional countries without additional R&D to adopt the innovation
to local conditions. As this comes with opportunity costs, models that ignore this cost may
overstate the benefits of new technologies.

42

One caveat is that, for climate change, emission reductions currently focus on reducing combustion of fossil fuels,
rather than cleaning emissions from a smokestack. As such, incentives for diffusion of these technologies exist via
savings in energy costs.

The table shows the average change in the hazard ratio resulting from changes in the technology variables over time. The
values are the average of the additional contribution from new technology each year. The additional contribution is
calculated as exp(β*X(t)) - exp(β*X(t-1)), where X(t) is a vector of the various technology variables (both levels and
growth rates) in each year.

Appendix A – Knowledge Stock Sensitivity Analysis
In this appendix, I examine the sensitivity of the regression results to changes in the rates
of decay and diffusion used to calculate the knowledge stock. I focus on interpretation of the
knowledge variables, as there are no significant changes to the parameters of other variables
when the rates of decay and diffusion are changed. In addition to the base rates of decay = 0.1
and diffusion = 0.25, I consider three alternative sets of decay and diffusion rates. To aid in
interpreting these rates, I also note the number of years it takes for a patent to have its maximum
effect on the stock under each set of assumptions. For comparison, patents have their maximum
effect after 4 years using the base rates.
•

decay = 0.25, diffuse = 0.5 (peak = 1 year)

•

decay = 0.05, diffuse = 0.5 (peak = 4 years)

•

decay = 0.05, diffuse = 0.1 (peak = 10 years)

Tables A1 – A4 present the estimates for the knowledge stock coefficients for each of the
model specifications.

Note that there are few changes in sign or significance of individual

parameters. Most of the changes that do occur are in the model including growth rates of both
foreign and domestic knowledge stocks.

As noted in footnote 37, the results suggest that

multicollinearity is a problem for this specification. Other than that, only the model assuming fast
diffusion differs much from the base results.
Table A5 presents the tests for joint significance of the knowledge variables.

For

combustion modification, these results are also unchanged across the various assumptions of decay
and diffusion. For the post combustion technologies, the alternative assumptions about decay and
diffusion increase the joint significance of the knowledge variables. This result is particularly
striking for the slowest diffusion assumption. However, slower diffusion of the post-combustion

Adoption of NOX Control Technologies at U.S. Power Plants

techniques occurs because the U.S. adopted stringent NOX regulations more slowly than other
countries. The base case decay and diffusion are chosen to be consistent with other studies in the
literature of knowledge flows. As regulatory differences appear to be the main influence on
adoption, there is no theoretical reason to a priori impose slower rates of decay and diffusion on
the spread of knowledge itself.
To better interpret the differences, Table A6 reproduces the net technology effects shown
in Table 5 of the main text for each of the decay and diffusion assumptions. Comparing the
magnitude of the net effects is important, as the magnitude of the coefficients vary in part because
the magnitude of the stocks themselves varies as the rates of decay and diffusion are changed.
Here, we see a few cases where the effect of knowledge varies. One, as discussed before, is in the
model including growth rates for both domestic and foreign technology. A second is in the model
using only the overall technology level for NOX post combustion. Here, the average net effect of
technology ranges from 2.5% with rapid diffusion to 19.0% with slow diffusion. However, these
differences are smaller in the more complete models for this technology, with a range of 11.5%26.2% in the most complete model.
