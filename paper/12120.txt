ABSTRACT
This study examines the effect of the introduction of new laboratory procedures and other
medical goods and services on the health of Americans during the period 1990-2003. We
hypothesize that, the more medical innovation there is related to a medical condition, the greater the
improvement in the average health of people with that condition. To test this hypothesis, we estimate
models of health outcomes using longitudinal disease-level data. We measure innovation in five
types of medical procedures or products: pathology & laboratory procedures, outpatient prescription
drugs, inpatient prescription drugs, surgical procedures, and diagnostic radiology procedures.
We examine two kinds of (inverse) indicators of health: mortality and disability. The
mortality indicator we analyze is the mean age at death of people whose underlying cause of death
is medical condition i. The disability measures we analyze are the fraction of people with medical
condition i who (1) missed work, or (2) spent one or more days in bed, due to that condition.
Our estimates indicate that conditions with higher rates of lab and outpatient drug innovation
had larger increases in mean age at death, controlling for other medical innovation rates and initial
mean age at death. The 1990-1998 increase in mean age at death attributable to use of new lab
procedures is estimated to be about 6 months. This is 42% of the total increase in mean age at death
(1.18 years) in our sample of diseases. New laboratory procedures introduced during 1990-1998 are
estimated to have saved 1.13 million life-years in 1998. Expenditure per life-year gained from new
lab procedures is estimated to be $6093. Treatments that cost this amount are generally considered
to be quite cost-effective.
In the analysis of disability, when we don’t control for the initial level of disability, we find
that conditions with higher rates of lab and outpatient innovation had greater declines in the
probability of missing work during 1996-2003. This suggests that the use of new laboratory
procedures reduced the number of work-loss days in 2003 by 42 million. When we control for initial
disability, the inverse relationship between lab innovation and disability changes disappears. This
is because there is a significant inverse relationship between initial health and the extent of
laboratory innovation. But due to errors in measuring initial health, controlling for this variable may
cause the impact of innovation on health to be underestimated.

Economists believe that the development of new products is the main reason why
people are better off today than they were several generations ago. In their 1993 book,
Innovation and Growth in the Global Economy, Grossman and Helpman argued that
“innovative goods are better than older products simply because they provide more
‘product services’ in relation to their cost of production.” In their 1996 book, The
Economics of New Goods, Bresnahan and Gordon stated simply that “new goods are at
the heart of economic progress.” And in a recent paper, Measuring the Growth from
Better and Better Goods, Bils (2004) makes the case that “much of economic growth
occurs through growth in quality as new models of consumer goods replace older,
sometimes inferior, models.”
New goods do not emerge ex nihilo. They are usually the result of investment in
research and development (R&D). National Science Foundation data reveal that the
medical equipment and supplies industry is one of the most research-intensive industries
in the economy. As Figure 1 indicates, the ratio of R&D expenditure to sales is two and a
half times as high in this industry as it is in the average American industry.
In this paper I will examine the impact of a subset of the new products generated
by this industry—clinical laboratory products—on the longevity and quality of life of
Americans. FDA data indicate that, in the last decade, about 100 of these new products
have been introduced. I hypothesize that these new products have improved the quality
of information physicians and patients have about patients’ medical conditions, and have
therefore enabled more appropriate and effective treatment of those conditions. This may
be illustrated by two new kinds of tests: HIV tests, and genetic tests related to dosing of a
widely prescribed anti-blood clotting drug.
For almost two decades, HIV tests had two glaring flaws. They did not detect the
earliest stage of infection, when people are more likely to spread the virus. They also
took days to produce results, and many people never returned to learn whether they were
infected. New generations of tests can largely eliminate either the long waiting time for
results, or the failure to find early infections (but not both) (New York Times (2005a)).
About two million Americans take warfarin (Coumadin) each day to help prevent
blood clots because of problems like a heart attack, an abnormal heart rhythm, a stroke or
major surgery. Establishing a proper dose of warfarin as patients start taking the drug is

4
one of the peskiest problems in medical practice. Misjudgments in doses can critically
affect the clotting mechanism, leading to potentially fatal bleeding. At present, doctors
rely on costly blood tests that must be repeated frequently over a period of months to
adjust the dose to ensure that the drug will work safely. But a recent study suggests that
it may be possible to develop a standard genetic test that would allow doctors to quickly
and precisely choose a safe starting dose of warfarin (New York Times (2005b)).
This study will examine the effect of the introduction of new laboratory
procedures and other medical goods and services on the health of Americans during the
period 1990-2003.

Econometric specification
We hypothesize that, the more medical innovation there is related to a medical
condition, the greater the improvement in the average health of people with that
condition. To test this hypothesis, we will estimate the following model, using
longitudinal disease-level data:
H_ENDi – H_BEGINi = α + ∑j βj INNOVji + γ Zi + εi

(1)

where
H_ENDi = a measure of the average health of people with medical condition i at the
end of a period
H_BEGINi = a measure of the average health of people with medical condition i at the
beginning of the period
INNOVji = a measure of innovation of type j in the treatment of condition i during the
period
Zi = other attributes of medical condition i
We will measure innovation in five types of medical procedures or products (j = 1,…,5):
pathology & laboratory procedures (henceforth referred to as lab procedures), outpatient
prescription drugs, drugs administered by providers (e.g. chemotherapy; henceforth
referred to as inpatient prescription drugs), surgical procedures, and diagnostic radiology
procedures.

5
We will examine two kinds of (inverse) indicators of health: mortality and
disability. The mortality indicator we will analyze is the mean age at death of people
whose underlying cause of death is medical condition i. Data on mean age at death (and
the number of deaths), by cause, were obtained from the Multiple Cause-of-Death
Mortality Data from the National Vital Statistics System of the National Center for
Health Statistics. Each record in the micro data is based on information abstracted from
death certificates filed in vital statistics offices of each State and District of Columbia.
Causes of death were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision 1979-1998. The average number of records (deaths) per year is about 2.3
million.
The disability measures we will analyze are the fraction of people with medical
condition i who (1) missed work, or (2) spent one or more days in bed, due to that
condition. These data were constructed from the Medical Conditions files of the 1996
and 2003 waves of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).
Eq. (1) will be estimated via weighted least-squares, where the weight is equal to
the mean number of observations from which the dependent variable was computed
((N_BEGINi + N_ENDi)/2). In the mortality analysis, the weight is the mean of the
number of 1990 and 1998 deaths due to underlying cause i. In the disability analysis, the
weight is the mean of the number of records in the 1996 and 2003 Medical Conditions
files associated with condition i. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the
variance of (H_ENDi – H_BEGINi) is inversely proportional to ((N_BEGINi +
N_ENDi)/2). Figure 1 depicts the relationship across conditions between the 1990-1998
change in the mean age at death and the mean number of deaths. The variance of the
change in the mean age at death is much lower for conditions causing a larger number of
deaths.
Measures of innovation in the treatment of a condition during a period were
constructed as follows:
INNOVji = ∑p FREQpji NEWp / ∑p FREQpji

(2)

where
FREQpji = the number of times procedure p of type j was performed on patients
with diagnosis i in the last year of a period

6
NEWp = 1 if the CPT code for procedure p was established by the AMA after the
beginning of the period
= 0 otherwise
Data on utilization of medical procedures and products, by diagnosis (FREQpji),
were obtained from the MEDSTAT Marketscan database. MEDSTAT contains data on
outpatient and inpatient services (procedures) and outpatient prescriptions of hundreds of
thousands, or even millions, of individuals. Each outpatient and inpatient service record
contains one procedure code (usually a CPT code), one or more ICD-9 diagnosis codes,
and the amount paid for the procedure. Hence, we can compute the frequency of
procedures performed (and expenditure), by CPT code and ICD-9 code, in each year
(1990-2003).
The year in which CPT codes for laboratory, surgery, and radiology procedures
were first established by the American Medical Association was determined from the
AMA’s publication CPT Assistant Archives 1990-2003. To illustrate the data contained
therein, here is information about the first seven hematology and coagulation procedures
(a subset of lab procedures) listed:

A similar method was used to determine the vintage of drugs administered by
providers (e.g. chemotherapy), which are also reported in outpatient and inpatient
services files. However the codes for these procedures are not CPT codes established by
the AMA, and the dates the codes were established are not reported in CPT Assistant
Archives 1990-2003. These codes are Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System

7
(HCPCS) Level II Codes.1 We used Multum’s Lexicon database
(http://www.multum.com/Lexicon.htm) to determine the active ingredients of the drugs
corresponding to each of these HCPCS Level II Codes. We used data from the
Drugs@FDA database (http://www.fda.gov/cder/drugsatfda/datafiles/default.htm) to
determine the year in which each active ingredient was first approved by the FDA.
MEDSTAT outpatient prescription drug claims do not include diagnosis codes, so
we used a different source of data on outpatient prescription drugs that links prescriptions
written with diagnoses: the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS).

Sample characteristics

We have data on utilization of medical procedures and products during the period
1990-2003. However, the sample period for the mortality analysis is restricted to 19901998, and the sample period for the disability analysis is restricted to 1996-2003.
The initial year for the mortality analysis is 1990 because the data on the dates at
which CPT codes were established are left-censored: if a CPT code was established
before 1990, we can’t determine the year in which it was established. The final year is
1998 because the disease classification system used to code underlying cause-of-death for
deaths that occurred after 1998 is different from that used to code underlying cause-ofdeath for deaths that occurred earlier and from that used to code patient diagnoses in
MEDSTAT, NAMCS, and MEPS.
The disease classification system used to code underlying cause-of-death for
deaths that occurred in the United States during 1979-98, and to code patient diagnoses in
MEDSTAT, NAMCS, and MEPS data, is the Ninth Revision of the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD-9). The Tenth Revision of the ICD (ICD-10) was used to
1

Level II of the HCPCS is a standardized coding system that is used primarily to identify products,
supplies, and services not included in the CPT codes, such as ambulance services and durable medical
equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) when used outside a physician's office. Because
Medicare and other insurers cover a variety of services, supplies, and equipment that are not identified by
CPT codes, the level II HCPCS codes were established for submitting claims for these items. The
development and use of level II of the HCPCS began in the 1980's. Level II codes are also referred to as
alpha-numeric codes because they consist of a single alphabetical letter followed by 4 numeric digits, while
CPT codes are identified using 5 numeric digits. See

code underlying cause-of-death for deaths that occurred in 1999 and later years. The
ICD-9 and ICD-10 classification systems are quite different. The ICD-9 system has a 4digit numeric structure and about 5,000 categories for classifying cause-of-death. The
ICD-10 system has a 4-digit alphanumeric coding structure and about 8,000 categories
for classifying cause-of-death. Comparison of ICD-9 and ICD-10 shows that new
chapters have been added to the ICD, old chapters have been rearranged, causes of death
have been regrouped, and titles have changed. As a result of these changes, the two
classification schemes are different enough to make direct comparisons of cause-of-death
difficult.2
The sample period for the disability analysis is restricted to 1996-2003, because
1996 was the first year in which the MEPS was conducted.
We will analyze data at the 3-digit ICD-9 level.3 We exclude medical conditions
due to injury and poisoning (ICD-9 codes 800-999). The models we estimate will be
based on data on about 400 diseases.

Descriptive statistics

Table 1 shows data on procedures performed in 1998, by type and vintage. In
1998, the MEDSTAT data covered 92 firms. About 22 million outpatient and inpatient
lab, surgical, drug, and diagnostic radiology procedures were performed on the people
covered by these firms’ health plans. The total cost of these procedures was $1.94
billion. About 22% of the laboratory procedures performed had CPT codes that were
established by the AMA after 1990. The average cost of new lab procedures was only $1
higher than the average cost of old lab procedures ($24). For other types of procedures,
the average cost of new procedures was 1.8 to 11.0 times as high as the average cost of
old procedures. Lab procedures account for 60% of the total number of procedures
performed, but only 17% of total expenditure on these procedures.

About 1100 distinct lab tests (CPT codes) appear in the 1998 MEDSTAT data.

Table 4 shows summary mortality and innovation statistics for the sample of 3digit ICD-9 diseases during the period 1990-1998. Table 5 shows mortality and
laboratory innovation data for the 30 largest causes of death. Note that the extent of
laboratory innovation varied considerably across diseases. For some diseases, less than
16% of lab procedures were post-1990 procedures. In contrast, 33% of the lab
procedures for prostate cancer, and 41% of the lab procedures for HIV, were post-1990
procedures.

Mortality results

Estimates of models of the 1990-1998 change in mean age at death are presented
in Table 6. We estimated four different models. All models include five innovation
measures (lab procedures, outpatient rx, inpatient rx, surgical procedures, and diagnostic
radiology procedures), and the 1990-1998 change in the log of the number of deaths.
HIV is included in models 1 and 2, but excluded from models 3 and 4. As shown
in Table 5, among high-mortality diseases HIV is an outlier in terms of both laboratory
innovation and increase in mean age at death. It is therefore of interest to assess the
sensitivity of the estimates to the inclusion of this observation.
Eq. (1) may be viewed as a special case of the following equation, in which the
restriction π = 1 is imposed:
H_ENDi = α + ∑j βj INNOVji + γ Zi + π H_BEGINi + εi

(3)

H_ENDi - H_BEGINi = α + ∑j βj INNOVji + γ Zi + (π − 1) H_BEGINi + εi

(4)

or

Inclusion of H_BEGIN in eq. (4) is referred to as “baseline adjustment”. Arguments can
be made both for and against baseline adjustment. The argument for is that mean age at
death may be subject to regression to the mean: diseases with high initial mean ages at
death are likely to experience smaller increases in mean age at death (π < 1). If this is

10
true, and innovation is correlated with initial mean age at death, imposing the restriction
π = 1 may result in biased estimates of the β’s. In particular, if innovation is inversely
related to initial mean age at death—there is more innovation for diseases with the worst
initial health—then the β’s may be overestimated.
In our sample, there is a significant inverse relationship between initial health
(e.g. mean age at death) and the extent of laboratory and inpatient rx innovation: the rates
of innovation (% of new procedures) are highest for diseases with the worst initial health.
Initial health is uncorrelated with the rates of outpatient rx and diagnostic radiology
innovation, and positively correlated with surgical innovation: there was more surgical
innovation for diseases with high initial mean ages at death.
If H_BEGIN were measured without error, estimates of βj’s from the unrestricted
model (4) would be more reliable than estimates from the restricted model (1). In
practice, however, H_BEGIN is measured with error. In the presence of measurement
error, the estimate of π is biased towards zero: the estimate of π will be significantly less
than 1 even when true π = 1. Moreover, the bias will be transmitted to estimates of
coefficients on other regressors that are correlated with H_BEGIN. In particular,
coefficients on other regressors that are negatively correlated with H_BEGIN will also be
biased towards zero.
Previous investigators have recognized the potential pitfalls of baseline
adjustment. Campbell and Kenny (2002) argued there “are instances when problems are
actually created, instead of solved, by ‘correction’ for regression toward the mean.” And
Glymour et al (2005) concluded that
In many plausible situations, baseline adjustment induces a spurious statistical
association between [the treatment measure] and change in [outcome]. More
generally, when exposures are associated with baseline health status, this bias can
arise if change in health status preceded baseline assessment or if the dependent
variable measurement is unreliable or unstable. In some cases, change-score
analyses without baseline adjustment provide unbiased causal effect estimates
when baseline-adjusted estimates are biased.
Models 1 and 3 do not control for initial health (mean age at death in 1990);
models 2 and 4 do. The true effect of innovation on health may be bounded between
estimates from models that don’t and do control for initial health.

11
Consider the estimates of Model 1 in Table 6. The coefficients on laboratory,
outpatient rx, and inpatient rx innovation are positive and highly significant: diseases
with above-average rates of these types of innovation had above-average increases in
mean age at death. The coefficient on diagnostic radiology innovation is only marginally
significant (p-value = .16), and the coefficient on surgical innovation is not significant.4
The positive coefficient on the 1990-1998 change in the log of the number of deaths
indicates that diseases with larger percentage increases in the number of deaths tended to
have larger increases in mean age at death.
Model 2 controls for initial mean age at death, and (like Model 1) is based on a
sample including HIV. Not surprisingly, the coefficient on initial health is negative and
highly significant: mean age at death increased more for diseases with low initial ages.
Controlling for initial health has little effect on the outpatient rx coefficient. However, it
reduces the magnitude of the lab innovation coefficient by about 50%, and the coefficient
on inpatient rx innovation is no longer significant. The lab innovation coefficient is now
significant at the 6% level.
Model 3 excludes HIV and does not control for initial health. The estimates are
similar to the estimates of Model 1, but the coefficients on lab and outpatient rx
innovation are about 20% smaller when HIV is excluded. Model 4 excludes HIV and
controls for initial health. The estimates are similar to the estimates of Model 2.
To summarize the estimates, in all four models, the coefficients on lab innovation
and outpatient rx innovation are positive and significant at at least the 6% level; in some
models these coefficients are much more significant. Controlling for initial health
reduces the magnitude and significance of the lab and (especially) the inpatient rx

4

Measuring surgical innovation using CPT code changes may be problematic. Closer inspection of the
data on surgical procedures reveals that some “new” procedures are probably just relabeled or reclassified
old procedures, rather than true innovations. For example, the three procedures whose codes were added in
1997 which were most frequently performed in 1997 were 98940, 98941, and 98942, which correspond to
different types of chiropractic manipulative treatment of the spine. Undoubtedly, this type of treatment was
performed well before 1997. A new CPT code should therefore be considered a necessary condition for a
medical innovation, but not a sufficient condition: all innovations have new CPT codes, but some new CPT
codes are not innovations. The fraction of procedures with new CPT codes exceeds the fraction of truly
innovative procedures, perhaps by a significant amount, and the degree of overstatement varies across
diseases. In the future, I hope to develop a reliable method of distinguishing between truly innovative
procedures and old procedures with new CPT codes.

12
innovation coefficients, but if poor initial health stimulates innovation, controlling for
initial health may bias these coefficients downward.
Now we will assess the implications of the estimates of Model 2, which has the
lowest lab innovation coefficient and the second lowest outpatient rx coefficient. As
shown in Table 4, 20% of the lab procedures performed in 1998 were post-1990
procedures. The 1990-1998 increase in mean age at death attributable to use of new lab
procedures is estimated to be 0.49 years (= 2.44 * 0.20). This is 42% of the total increase
in mean age at death (1.18 years) in our sample of diseases. There were 2.31 million
deaths in the U.S. in 1998. If each of the 2.31 million people who died in 1998 lived 0.49
years longer due to 1990-1998 laboratory innovations, then these innovations saved 1.13
million (= 0.49 * 2.31 million) life-years in 1998.
The following table shows U.S. laboratory revenues during the period 199720035:

Total laboratory revenue was $30.6 billion in 1998. The data shown in Table 1 imply
that 22.5% of 1998 expenditure on laboratory procedures was spent on post-1990
procedures. Hence, about $6.9 billion (= 22.5% * $30.6 billion) was spent on post-1990
lab procedures in 1998. Expenditure per life-year gained from new lab procedures is
therefore $6093 (= $6.9 billion / 1.13 million life-years). Treatments that cost this
amount are generally considered to be quite cost-effective.

Due to the DRG reimbursement structure, estimation of revenues for hospital labs is difficult.

Disability results

Table 7 shows summary disability and innovation statistics for the sample of 335
3-digit ICD-9 diseases during the period 1996-2003. The disability statistics are based on
a much smaller number of individual-level observations than the mortality statistics: the
combined number of condition records in the 1996 and 2003 MEPS Medical Conditions
Files with non-missing disability data is 182,689. The rate of lab innovation during
1996-2003 was similar to the rate of lab innovation during 1990-1998. Nineteen percent
of the lab procedures performed in 2003 had CPT codes that were added after 1996. But
the other rates of innovation were lower: 19% of outpatient rx’s consumed in 1998 were
for drugs introduced after 1990, but only 12% of outpatient rx’s consumed in 2003 were
for drugs introduced after 1996.
Estimates of models of the 1996-2003 change in the fraction of people who
missed work or had bed days due to a condition are presented in Table 8. We estimated
models both excluding and including the level of disability in 1996. All models include
five 1996-2003 innovation measures (lab procedures, outpatient rx, inpatient rx, surgical
procedures, and diagnostic radiology procedures), and the 1996-2003 change in the log of
the number of people with the condition.
In Model 1, the dependent variable is the 1996-2003 change in the fraction of
people who missed work, and we don’t control for the level of disability in 1996. The
coefficient on lab innovation is negative and significant at the 2% level, and the
coefficient on outpatient rx innovation is negative and significant at the 6% level. This
implies that conditions with higher rates of lab and outpatient innovation had greater
declines in the probability of missing work during 1996-2003. Lab innovation during
1996-2003 is estimated to have reduced the probability of missing work in 2003 by .0092
(= 0.048 * 0.19). The average probability of missing work during this period was about
13%, so this represents about a 7% (= .0092 / .13) reduction in the probability of missing
work. The CDC estimates that there were about 598 million work-loss days in 2003
(Lethbridge-Çejku and Vickerie (2005, Table 17)). This suggests that the use of new
laboratory procedures reduced the number of work-loss days in 2003 by 42 million (=
7% * 598 million).

14
In Model 2, the dependent variable is the 1996-2003 change in the fraction of
people who had any bed days, and we again don’t control for the level of disability in
1996. The lab innovation coefficient is somewhat smaller, and is significant at the 7%
level. This suggests that conditions with higher rates of lab innovation during 1996-2003
had greater declines in the probability of having bed days.
Models 3 and 4 control for the level of disability in 1996. When we control for
initial disability, the lab and drug innovation coefficients are all statistically insignificant.
In this sample, as in the mortality sample, there is a significant inverse relationship
between initial health and the extent of laboratory innovation: the % of new lab
procedures is higher for diseases with the highest initial rates of missed work and bed
days. Due to errors in measuring initial health, controlling for this variable may cause the
impact of innovation on health to be underestimated.

Summary

This study has examined the effect of the introduction of new laboratory
procedures and other medical goods and services on the health of Americans during the
period 1990-2003. We hypothesized that, the more medical innovation there is related to
a medical condition, the greater the improvement in the average health of people with
that condition. To test this hypothesis, we estimated models of health outcomes using
longitudinal disease-level data. We measured innovation in five types of medical
procedures or products: pathology & laboratory procedures, outpatient prescription drugs,
inpatient prescription drugs, surgical procedures, and diagnostic radiology procedures.
We examined two kinds of (inverse) indicators of health: mortality and disability.
The mortality indicator we analyzed is the mean age at death of people whose underlying
cause of death is medical condition i. The disability measures we analyzed are the
fraction of people with medical condition i who (1) missed work, or (2) spent one or
more days in bed, due to that condition.
Our estimates indicated that conditions with higher rates of lab and outpatient
drug innovation had larger increases in mean age at death, controlling for other medical
innovation rates and initial mean age at death. The 1990-1998 increase in mean age at

15
death attributable to use of new lab procedures is estimated to be about 6 months. This is
42% of the total increase in mean age at death (1.18 years) in our sample of diseases.
New laboratory procedures introduced during 1990-1998 are estimated to have saved
1.13 million life-years in 1998. Expenditure per life-year gained from new lab
procedures is estimated to be $6093. Treatments that cost this amount are generally
considered to be quite cost-effective.
In the analysis of disability, when we didn’t control for the initial level of
disability, we found that conditions with higher rates of lab and outpatient innovation had
greater declines in the probability of missing work during 1996-2003. This suggested
that the use of new laboratory procedures reduced the number of work-loss days in 2003
by 42 million. When we controlled for initial disability, the inverse relationship between
lab innovation and disability changes disappeared. This is because there is a significant
inverse relationship between initial health and the extent of laboratory innovation. Due to
errors in measuring initial health, controlling for this variable may cause the impact of
innovation on health to be underestimated.
