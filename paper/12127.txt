JEL No. F3, G3
ABSTRACT
We find an empirical regularity that stronger creditor protection reduces the volatility of stock market
prices. We analyze two distinct mechanisms that characterize equity price volatility: government
guarantees and creditor protection. Using a Tobin q model, we demonstrate that weak creditor
protection that gives rise to government guarantees and tightens credit constraints, increases stock
price volatility. Empirically, accounting for the probability of financial crises, we find that
government guarantees and weak institutions that tighten credit constraints increase aggregated stock
price volatility.

Introduction

The paper addresses links between cross-country differences in institutional strength and macroeconomic
performance. Specifically, we ask how creditor protection and government guarantees affect the volatility of
stock market prices.
A series of works have studied the impact of creditor protection on the firm’s external finance availability.
La Porta et. al. (1997) examine a sample of 49 countries and find that countries with poor creditor protection
have, on average, smaller debt markets. Levine (2004) confirms these findings after including a variety of
additional control variables. Djankov, McLiesh, and Shleifer (2005) expand the external finance volatility
analysis to 129 countries. Again, they find that creditor protection is associated with higher ratio of private
credit to GDP. Better creditor protection has also been shown to lower the firm’s borrowing cost. La Porta
et al. (2000) find that the cost of capital is higher, and the firm valuation lower, in countries with weak
property rights. Bae and Goyal (2003) use data from 37 countries to examine how creditor rights affect loan
spreads (over the LIBOR or the prime rate) in international bank loans. They find that banks charge higher
loan spreads when property rights are weak.
Creditor protection affects also other aspects of the economy. Nenova et al. (2000) analyze more than
11,000 firms in 46 countries and find that stronger creditor rights reduce the cash-flow risk, operating income
variability, and the operating leverage. Galindo (2001) studies the impact of creditor rights on the credit
cycle. He finds that creditor rights play an important role, by exacerbating credit risk in countries where
creditor rights are weakly protected, and hence inducing an over-reaction of credit markets to exogenous
shocks. Burger and Warnock (2004) examine foreign participation in 49 local bond markets, and find that
countries with strong creditor rights have on average more developed local bond markets, and they also rely
less on foreign-currency-denominated bonds. Moreover, more developed bond markets have a distribution of
returns characterized by high variance and negative skewness, factors eschewed by U.S. investors. Shleifer
(2003) further argues that for sovereign debt market to survive, the rights of creditors need to be protected
effectively.
However, most of these studies focus on the credit market and much less on the stock market. In this
paper, we try to fill a gap by looking at how creditor rights and government guarantees affect the stock return
volatility for market aggregates. As a theoretical rationale behind the empirical link between institutional
features and asset price volatility, we analyze two distinct mechanisms. First, we consider government
2

guarantees that lead to moral hazard. Such moral hazard may increase stock price volatility. Second, we
argue that creditor protection that may relax credit constraints is also associated with equity price volatility,
and the institutional weakness in the credit market exacerbates the volatility. There have been earlier studies
on how corporate control affects the dispersion of stock prices with a market. For example, Morck, Yeung
and Yu (2000) look at the stock price co-movement within a country. They find that co-movement is more
pronounced in poor economies than in rich economies, which they contribute to cross-country differences in
property rights. Our work is not concerned with the idiosyncratic dispersion of stock prices, but rather with
the instability in the aggregate. We expect that better creditor protection could reduce market volatility.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 examines empirical regularities associated with the link
between creditor rights and stock market volatility. Section 3 analyzes two candidate mechanisms behind
the empirical regularities: government guarantees and institutional features which affect credit constraints.
Section 4 attempts to empirically separate these two mechanisms in the data. Section 5 concludes.

Empirical Regularities

2.1

Data

In this section, we look at the correlation between creditor rights, stock price volatility and credit growth
volatility . Our creditor protection index comes from La Porta, et al. (1998).1 The creditor rights index
ranges from 0 to 4 and is formed by adding one when the country imposes restrictions, such as creditor
consent or minimum dividends to file for reorganization. In addition when secured creditors are able to gain
possession of their security once the reorganization petition has been approved (no automatic stay); secured
creditors are ranked first in the distribution of the proceeds that result from the disposition of the assets of
a bankrupt firm; and the debtor does not retain the administration of its property pending the resolution of
the reorganization. Therefore, higher creditor rights index is associated with better protection for creditors.
In some analysis we also use the index of shareholder rights from La Porta et al. (2000). This index
ranges from zero to six and is formed by adding one when: the country allows shareholders to mail their
proxy vote to the firm; shareholders are not required to deposit their shares prior to the General Shareholders
Meeting; cumulative voting or proportional representation of minorities in the board of directors is allowed;
1 See

an oppressed minorities mechanism is in place; the minimum percentage of share capital that entitles a
shareholder to call for an Extraordinary Shareholders Meeting is less than or equal to 10 percent (the sample
median); shareholders have preemptive rights that can only be waved by a shareholders vote.
We also use the index for law and order from La Porta, et al. (1998), which ranges form zero to ten,
with higher number associated with better law implementation. Table 1 reports these three indexes for 20
countries in our sample. These indexes do not vary over time and are assessed as of early 1990s, close to the
beginning of our sample.
The data for stock market indexes come from Global Financial Data. We have monthly data (end of
month closes, as calculated by central banks, national statistical agencies, or stock exchanges themselves).
We study 20 developed and developing countries over the sample period from 1991 to 2000. The country
coverage includes emerging economies (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Hong Kong, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand,
Singapore), as well as developed economies (Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Japan,
New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, UK and US).

2.2

Creditor Rights and Stock Price Volatility

To measure the stock return volatility, we use the Officer’s method (Officer (1973)). The Officer method
estimates the stock return standard deviation for month 1 to month 12; next estimate the standard deviation from month 2 to month 13; and then repeat the procedure, rolling the sample forward continuously. A
potential problem with Officer’s approach is that the use of overlapping observations will create a correlation
between standard deviations at different points in time. An alternative is to use non–overlapping observations. That is, to compute the standard deviation using, say, months 1 through 12, 13 through 24, and so
forth. The problem is that this procedure results in relatively few data points. We tried both methods and
obtain similar results.
We estimate the equation:
ln (σit ) = α0 + α1 Di + εit
where σit is the stock return standard deviation estimated from our Officer’s non-overlapping method,2 α0 is
the constant term, and the vector Di includes the indexes for creditor protection and law and order. Owing
to data limitation, Di is however not time–varying.
2 Thus

we use only month 12 of each year.

4

Table 2 demonstrates the link between credit protection and stock return variability. We can see that
better law and order and credit rights protection are associated with lower stock price volatility. We also
find that the coefficient of multiple correlation between these two indexes and the variance of the stock price
volatility is quite high. In the regression which excludes time fixed effects we obtain an R2 of 0.30.

2.3

Creditor Rights and Credit Growth Volatility

It is possible that creditor protection reduces stock volatility because it reduces the volatility of private
credit. In this subsection, we examine this explanation. We measure the annual standard deviation of the
private credit growth as in Schwert (1989). For most countries, we have only annual private credit estimates
for the period from 1980 to 2000. We therefore implement the following procedure:
First, we estimate a 2nd-order autoregression for the private credit growth rate mt , using all the annual
data available:
mt = k1 + φ1 mt−1 + φ2 mt−2 + µmt
where µmt is the disturbance term.
We then estimate a 2nd-order autoregression for the absolute values of the errors from the above regression,
|µ̂mt | = ρ0 + ρ1 |µ̂mt−1 | + ρ2 |µ̂mt−2 | + ζt
The fitted values, |µ̃mt |, from this regression measure the conditional standard deviation of mt , given
information available before time t.
We then regress |µ̃mt | onto the creditor protection index, as well as the law and order index :
ln (|µ̂mt |) = β0 + β1 Di + ηit
Results are presented in Table 3. We indeed find that both law and order and creditor protection are
associated with lower volatility of private credit. This time the R2 in the regression without time fixed effects
is lower than before, 0.23, but still respectable. Thus, it is indeed possible that law and order and creditor
protection affect stock market volatility only through credit volatility, a possibility we explore next.

2.4

Creditor Rights, Credit Growth Volatility and Stock Market Volatility

Finally, we estimate how the volatility of private credit affects stock return volatility. We follow Schwert
(1989) by estimating a regression equation of the form

ln (σit ) = α0 + α1 Dit + α2 ln (|µ̂mt |) + εit .
Note that since |µ̂mt | is a linear prediction based on |µ̂mt−1 | and |µ̂mt−2 |, the above equation is essentially
a regression of ln (σit ) onto |µ̂mt−1 | and |µ̂mt−2 |; which helps control for the potential endogeneity of credit
volatility.
The estimation results are presented in Table 4. We find that credit growth volatility is indeed positively
associated with stock price volatility. Moreover, creditor protection now is no longer significantly associated
with stock market volatility (the associated P-value is now 0.33). Thus we find that one potential channel
through which creditor protection may depress stock volatility is through reducing the volatility of private
credit.

Theory

We analyze two Tobin-q models that demonstrate potential links between creditor rights and government
guarantees and stock price volatility. We first present a model with government guarantees and we then
proceed to a model with an institutional mechanism.

3.1

Credit Guarantees

Consider a small open economy, producing a single aggregate tradable good. The production function for
that good, Y , is Cobb-Douglas:3
Yt = At Kt1−ρ ,
3 The

model is based on Krugman (1998) and Frenkel and Razin (1996, Chapter 7).

6

(1)

where At , 1 − ρ, and Kt denote the productivity level, the distributive share of capital, and the capital stock,
respectively. We assume that productivity levels follow a first-order autoregressive stochastic process:

ln(At+1 ) = γ ln(At ) + εt+1

(2)

where εt+1 follows a uniform distribution over the region [−1, 1]. Using small letters to denote logs of cap
letters, we get
at+1 = γat + εt+1 .

(3)

Firms maximize the expected value of the discounted sum of profits subject to the available production
technology and to a cost-of-adjustment investment technology. According to the latter, gross investment
(Zt ) is specified as

µ
¶
1 1 It
Zt = It 1 +
,
2 v Kt

where It = Kt+1 − Kt , and

1
v

(4)

denote net capital formation (assuming zero depreciation) and a cost-of-

adjustment coefficient, respectively. In the presence of costs of adjustment, gross investment typically exceeds
net capital formation, because of the additional costs of the reorganization and retraining associated with
the installation of new capital equipment.
Denote r as the world interest rate, a representative firm will maximize the following Lagrangian:
·
L = E Σ∞

(1 + r)

´¸
At Kt1−ρ − Zt + qt (Kt + It − Kt+1 ) ,

(5)

where the Lagrangian qt could be interpreted as Tobin’s q.
Maximizing the Lagrangian gives two first order conditions. The first one is with respect to It :
1+

1 It
= qt .
v Kt

(6)

Denoting ln (Kt ) as kt and linearizing ln (υ (qt − 1) + 1) gives
kt+1 = kt + v (qt − 1) .

+ Et [qt+1 ] ,

(8)

where Rt+1 is the capital rental rate. The optimal-investment rule in equation (8) implies that the cost of
investing an additional unit of capital in the current period must be equal to the expected present value
of the next period’s marginal productivity of capital, plus the next period’s induced fall in the adjustment
cost of investment resulting from the enlarged stock of capital, plus the continuation value in the capital
remaining for the entire future.
Note that from equation (1):
−ρ
Rt+1 = (1 − ρ) At+1 Kt+1
.

(9)

Linearizing ln (Rt+1 ), and denoting π ≡ 1 + ln (1 − ρ), yields:
Rt+1 = π − ρkt+1 + at+1 .
For simplification, assume that

is relatively small compared with other two terms on the right

qt = B0 + B1 at + B2 kt .

From equations (7) and (13), we get

Et qt+1 = B0 + B1 (γat ) + B2 (kt + v (qt − 1)) .

(14)

Substituting equations (13) and (14) into equation (12), we solve B0 , B1 , B2 by comparing coefficients

Credit Guarantees

Now suppose that the government guarantees the investment if at+1 < g. That is, if at+1 < g, the net payoff
to the firm will be
Net Payoff = 0.

(16)

However, if at > g, the net payoff to the firm will be
Et Rt+1 + Et qt+1 − (1 + r)qt .

(17)

Then equation (11) becomes

(18)

(1 + r)qt
= (1 + r)qt ∗ Pr (at+1 < g) + Et [π − ρkt+1 + at+1 + qt+1 | at+1 > g] ∗ Pr (at+1 > g) ,

where Et [.|at+1 > g] is the expectation conditioned on at+1 > g. Combining equations (7) and (18) generates
qt =

π + ρυ − ρkt + Et [at+1 + qt+1 |at+1 > g]

Substituting equations (7), (20), (21) and (22) into equation (19),we solve B00 , B10 , B20 by comparing
coefficients for at and kt :

Note that with more government guarantees s is larger, and B00 is also larger. Thus as expected government guarantees raise the stock price qt .
The stock return volatility, conditioned on information available at time t (i.e., at , kt , qt0 ), is:

V art [B10 at+1 + B20 kt+1 − B10 at − B20 kt ]

V art [B10 εt+1 ]

A rise in s increases B10 and therefore causes larger stock return volatility for any given realization of
at+1 . Since countries with better creditor protection tend to have smaller social demand for government
guarantees, better creditor protection could then lower stock return volatility.
5 Note

that conditioned on at , at+1 has a uniform distribution over [γat − 1, γat + 1].

3.2

Creditor Protection and Credit-Constrained Investment

We now analyze an alternative Tobin Q mechanism that evolves around credit constraints.6
Assume that the firm has to borrow from the creditor a durable input Wt , where Wt ∈ [0, 1]. At the
end of the period t, the firm needs to return Wt . For simplicity, assume that the interest rate paid on the
durable input is zero. Then the firm will borrow up to 1. However, there are some chances that the firm is
not willing, or able, to return Wt , and the creditor has to go to a costly court procedure to claim back the
durable good Wt . Therefore, the creditor imposes an ex ante constraint on how much the firm can borrow.
More specifically,
Wt ≤ min[ωAt , 1].

(25)

The borrowed input is constrained by the firm’s productivity level At : as At decreases, the firm will have
to borrow less. Finally, higher ω is associated with better creditor protection.7
Assume that production function is:
Yt = At Wt Kt1−ρ .

(26)

Therefore, if Wt = ωAt , then Y = At ωAt Kt1−ρ . However, if Wt = 1 , Y = At Kt1−ρ .
A representative firm will maximize the following Lagrangian:

(27)

where the Lagrangian multiplier, qt , is interpreted again as Tobin Q.
Maximizing this Lagrangian will again gives us equations (7) and (8), although now the form for Et [Rt+1 ]
is different. At time t, the firm needs to take into account whether the constraint will be binding or not at

the literature on credit constraint and financial accelerator, the constraint tends to be based on a firm’s market value
qt kt . However, if both qt and kt are endogenous as in Mendoza (2005), then no tractable solution is available. By using At
rather than qt , we are able to provide tractable closed-form solutions.

Note that Et [π − ρkt+1 + 2at+1 + ln ω | Wt < 1] is the expected Rt+1 when the constraint is binding, while

As ω increases, B100 decreases, which lowers V art qt+1
− qt00 . Therefore, better creditor protection reduces
the price volatility. Note that as ω increases, B000 increases, so Tobin qt00 increases rather than decreases.
Having established two channels that connect institutional features to asset price volatility, we proceed
with empirical analysis of these channels.

4

Evidence

We now attempt to determine which of the two channels presented in the model (government guarantees or
credit constraints), if any, is responsible for the transmission of the creditor protection to the stock market
volatility. To do so, we first estimate a benchmark model of the stock price volatility to which we add, one
at a time (and also together), our proxies for the degree of government guarantees and tightness of credit
constraints.

4.1

Empirical Approach

In recent literature, financial crises are triggered not only by fundamental shocks, but also by the degree to
which market expectations about these fundamentals are coordinated. In the absence of common knowledge,
an individual market participant receives only an independent and noisy signal about the fundamentals
but also must have some uncertainty about the other market participants’ expectations. Morris and Shin
(2000) show how the market participants’ knowledge about the statistical distributions of the signals and
the market fundamentals (but not the actual realization of the fundamental and its idiosyncratic signals)
helps to coordinate the behavior of market participants. The coordination of expectations induces a unique
8 Note

that (1 − ln $) is positive in the model. Therefore, as $ increases, (1 − ln $)2 decreases.

13

equilibrium in such a set up, in which there exists a unique threshold level of the fundamental.9
This recent theory of financial crises can guide us as to how to design our empirical approach. Financial
crises are cast in terms of self-fulfilling expectation games. Self-fulfilling expectations games played by market
participants have elements of a “beauty contest” (Allen, Morris and Shin, 2003). Market participants must
care not just about acting in the way that conforms with current fundamentals, but also about acting similarly
to the way other do. Institutional features determine the stochastic distribution of the fundamentals and the
effect of the market fundamentals on the performance of institutions. Thus, for example, deposit insurance
exerts not only a direct effect on stock return volatility, through the government guarantees mechanism, but
it could also have an indirect effect on the volatility, through its impact on the probability of financial crises.
That is, the deposit insurance can reduce the probability of bank runs (Diamond and Dybvig, 1983) and
thereby reduce the probability of financial crises.
We define financial crisis as an event of a big increase in the real interest rate of over 3 percentage points
in one year, which corresponds to highest 10% of annual changes in real interest rate in our sample. We also
define an alternative measure, to be used for the robustness tests, where crisis is defined as an increase in the
real interest rate of over 7.1 percentage points in one year, or top 5% of annual real interest rate changes.
Table 5 presents a list of countries and years for which our financial crisis indicator is equal to 1 along with
the value our more strict indicator takes and the changes in real interest rate.
Following the methodology in Razin and Rubinstein (2006), we use a financial crisis indicator to estimate
the following model.


 1 if yit > 0
,
I(crisis)it =
 0 if y ≤ 0
it

where y is a latent variable and a function of our independent variables:
0
yit = Xit
β + εit ,

and ε have either normal or logistic PDF. We also estimate linear probability model
0
I(crisis)it = Xit
β + εit .
9 In

a limiting case when the signal’s residual approaches zero.

14

We then construct a measure of the probability of financial crisis as a predicted value from the above
estimation, which we use in the analysis of stock market volatility. We first estimate a benchmark model
0
ln(σit ) = αi + γ ∗ Pr(crisis)it + Zit
δ + ωit ,

where ln(σit ) is our measure of the stock market volatility, for December of each year; αi is a set of country
fixed effects, Zit is a set of control variables, errors ωit are allowed to be serially correlated and heteroschedastic. We use GLS in order to estimate this regression.
Given high level of autocorrelation in errors, we are concerned about the specification of our model. We
estimate, alternatively, the dynamic panel regression, using Arellano and Bond (1991) method:
0
ln(σit ) = α1 ln(σit−1 ) + α2 ln(σit−2 ) + γ ∗ Pr(crisis)it + Zit
δ + υit ,

where we specify the size of the stock market as exogenous and the probability of the crisis as predetermined
variables.
We then proceed by adding our proxies of government bailouts and credit constraints to see whether they
have an effect on stock market volatility.
Actual government bailouts are highly endogenous and crisis dependent, we are therefore more interested
in the potential government bailouts. To proxy for this we use an indicator of whether the country had an
explicit deposit insurance, financed by either government or private funds. We include deposit insurance
financed by private funds, because in most cases these funds would themselves expect to be bailed–out by the
government. The data for the deposit insurance comes from the World Bank Deposit Insurance Database.
Credit constraints are notoriously difficult to measure. At the aggregate level, we assume that the
availability of foreign financing for the country is highly correlated with aggregate availability of funds, since
domestic resources are limited by aggregate savings, which are usually not very volatile. In the spirit of
Klein, Peek and Rosengren (2002), we use country’s sovereign rating from Standard & Poors as a proxy
for the country’s aggregate credit constraint.10 When the sovereign rating is poor, government, banks and
non–financial firms find it expensive to borrow abroad and therefore compete for domestic resources. In the
countries with weak institutions, lending to the private sector would be squeezed first, leading to the credit

constraints.
Evidently, one cannot possibly account by institutional variables for all the cross–country differences that
would account for the variations in the stock market volatility between countries. Thus, we employ country
specific fixed–effects regression analysis. Since our creditor rights measures do not vary over time, they drop
out from some stages of our analysis.

4.2

Results

We now report the results of the two stage estimation procedure: probability of crises and stock price
volatility.
4.2.1

Probability of Financial Crises

Table 6 shows our first stage estimation of the probability of financial crises. Since fixed effects Probit
regressions are not identified due to incidental parameters problem, we use pooled specification which also
allows us to include our measures of creditor rights protection. Since our proxies of government guarantees
and credit constraints might also affect the probability of financial crises, we include them in the regression
as well. Changes in banking system reserves and in commercial bank credit to the private sector (corrected
for inflation) could also be indicative of the financial crisis. Finally, since the United States interest rates
tend to be transmitted to credit conditions in other countries, we include US 3-year Treasury rate.
As we would expect, better shareholder and creditor rights protection lowers the probability of financial
crisis, while sovereign credit risk increases the probability of crises. We expected deposit insurance to reduce
the probability of the crisis (see Diamond and Dybvig, 1983), and indeed we find that it has a stabilizing
effect. We also see that financial crises are more likely when domestic commercial banks decrease their
lending to private sector and increase their reserves. But we interpret these as feedbacks rather than causes
of financial crises, because we do not have available good instruments. Finally, as we would expect, financial
crises are more likely when US Treasury rate is high.
Since column (4) seems to provide the best fit, we use it to predict the probability of financial crisis to
be used in our second stage.

4.2.2

Stock Price Volatility

Benchmark results of the GLS estimation of our second stage regression are reported in column (1) of Table 7.
We can see that higher probability of financial crises increases the stock price volatility, while higher GDP
growth rate (which we lag by one year) lowers it.11 We also control for the size of the domestic stock market,
by including the (log of) number of firms listed on the market. As expected, larger markets are less volatile
than thinner markets.
The predicted crisis probability is of course a function of our measures of deposit insurance and credit
constraint proxies. In order to see whether the effect of the crisis probability on stock price volatility is
due to either of these variables, we include them one at a time (columns (2) and (3)), and also together
(column (4)). In columns (2) and (4) the coefficient on the credit rating is significant while the coefficient
on the probability of the crisis is reduced, significantly. We therefore find that credit rating (our proxy for
the severity of credit constraints) indeed accounts for some, although not all, of the effect. The deposit
insurance, on the other hand, does not seem to have any effect. We temporarily conclude that the credit
constraints seem to be a more likely channel affecting the volatility of the stock market than government
guarantees.
The results of the dynamic panel regression (as in Arellano and Bond (1991)) are now reported in Table 8.
We can see that credit rating still enters significantly, however, including it no longer reduces the effect of the
predicted crisis probability. Interestingly, deposit insurance now enters significantly, when included by itself.
However its presence does not have an effect on the crisis probability coefficient. Thus, we conclude that
while credit constraints and government guarantees do indeed affect the stock price volatility, as predicted
by the theory, these are not the only channels through which financial conditions and stock market volatility
are linked.

A Concluding Remark

The paper may have an interesting implication for the literature on the ”equity premium” puzzle. To the
extent that institutional weaknesses raise the variance on stock returns, they may also contribute to the

(December), while the rest of the variables are either flows over the year or average for the year.

spread between the mean return and the safe return on bonds. We conjecture that the introducing of
elements of risk aversion to the models on credit guarantees and credit constraints may explain part of the
equity puzzle and the variations of the equity puzzle across economies of different institutional characteristics.
