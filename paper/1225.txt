Optimal Stabilization Rules in a Stochastic
Model of Investment with Gestation Lags

ABSTRACT

This paper considers the problem of calculating optimal policy rules
to stabilize fluctuations in investment in an economy where firms' invest-

ment behavior can be described by a dynamic optimization model. In the
optimization model, the dynamics of investment are generated by heterogeneous
gestation lags between the start and completion of capital projects, rather

than by adjustment costs in the installation of capital. A procedure is
derived for calculating policy rules for an arbitrary autoregressive process

generating fluctuations in firms sales. Through stochastic simulation we
investigate the effects of using certain suboptimal policy rules in cases
where there are constraints against using the optimal rules.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the dynamic investment modal is presented and an investment demand equation is derived. In

derived for an arbitrary autoregressive process generating the

2. An investment model with heterogeneous gestation lags
Suppose that firms use ii different types of capital inputs. Let the
stock of capital of type i at the start of time period t be denoted by
i =

1,... ,n.

The types of capital differ in their gestation times;

that is the time it takes to build a unit of capital. Capital of type i

is assumed to take i periods to build. Let s be the value of capital
projects of type i started at time t. Then we have

k.
it-h.

(1)

where h. is a constant proportional depreciation rate for each type of

capital. According to equation (1) capital projects of type i started at
time t are completed and added to the capital stock at time t + i.

Depreciation of the amount h1k÷1_i is subtracted from gross completions
to get the net increase in capital.1
Invesient expenditure, or "value put in place," during the gestation
period of each project depends on the technology of construction. Let
be the value put in place on a capital project of type i during period t.

Let

be the fraction of the project of type i put in place during the

th period following the start of the project. Then total investment
expenditures on projects of type i are given by the distributed lag

The variable y is assumed to follow a known

univariate stochastic process exogenous to the firm. As will be explained
below the variables c., -which are also exogenous to the firm, will be

policy determined as a function of y. The interpretation of (3) is
that a firmts production process calls for capital of each type in a
fixed ratio V.

to

total sales y, and that it is costly for the firm

to deviate from that amount of capital in either a positive or a negative

direction. This approach is similar to assuming a fixed coefficient
production function with capital input coefficients equal to
but it permits more flexibility in that the firm can deviate (at some cost)

from these input coefficients. Note that we assume that there are no
interaction affects in the costs of deviating from these input coefficients
for different types of capital: one type of capital deviating from its
appropriate level, neither increases nor decreases the costs of another

type of capital deviating from its appropriate level. The lack of
interaction makes possible a convenient analytical solution of the model,
and seems reasonable given the f.ixed coefficient production interpretation
of the objective function.

equation (4) indicates that the resulting investment demand function
depends explicitly on technological parameters and on expectations of
future variables, a general property of demand functions obtained from
intertemporal investment models mentioned in the introduction.
In the special case where the depreciation rates h. = 0 and the
discount factor is equal to 1, the optimal level of starts depends on
a distributed lead in the expected changes in the cost of investment

goods. In the case where depreciation rates are h. =

1, the distributed

lead is in the level of the costs of investment goods.

Optimal Policy Rules

The model has been designed so that y is a correlated disturbance

that causes fluctuations in investment. We view

as driven by an

—6

exogenous

time series process representing, for example, business cycle

fluctuations. One objective of policy is to reduce the fluctuations in
investment by using investment incentives to offset the influence of this

disturbance. Investment incentives affect the actual cost paid by firms
for investment goods which we have represented by c. in the model.
Hence, the optimal control problem we consider is that of choosing a

sequence of policy instruments c. so as to minimize the fluctuations in

the target x. The optimal choice of c. depends on the stochastic
process

for y. As with most optimal control or regulator problems the

effect of the disturbances can be completely offset if there are a
sufficient number of instruments. As indicated by (4), the number of
instruments needed for complete offset is equal the number of
types

different

of capital. In principle, therefore, it is necessary to have

investment incentives for each type of capital so 'that each of the

can be set independently. In practice, tax incentives have differed
for capital with different useful lives, but not for capital with
different gestation periods.-'
In order to offset the effects of demand fluctuations on investment
it is necessary that the cost variable c respond to y in such a way

that the forecasts of future values of c. exactly
of future

offset

the forecasts

in equation (4). That is, c. needs to be set so that

will eliminate the effect of the distrubance y on starts and thereby on

these optimal c.1.

Assume that y is determined by the following th order autoregressive
process.

where u is an uncorrelated random variable with a zero mean. Equation
(6) can be used to generate predictions of the future values of y that

appear in equation (5) using results from prediction theory. See
Anderson (1971, ch. 5).

In order to obtain the optimal rule for the

determination of the c. we start with the general linear form

(7)

where the coefficients g1 through g. are as yet undetermined. Predic-

tions of future c. can be obtained using (7) and the predictions of
generated by (6). The problem of finding the optimal

rule

is thus

reduced to the problem of finding the values of the coefficients that

satisfy equation (5) for all t. These values can be found by substituting

into (5) the forecasts of y and c. using (6) and (7), and finding the
values of g.1 through g. which bring the coefficients of

through

to equality on both sides of (5). We now show how this procedure
results in a set of linear equations in g. through g. which are
straightforward to solve, even for fairly large values of ii and p.

The procedure has some similarities to the feedforward control schemes
proposed by Box and Jenkins (1970, ch. 12) for conventional linear
regulator problems.

Note the equations in (22) are equivalent to the equation in (16) for 1=1,

Hence, the entire set of optimal control coefficients g., i=1,. .. ,n

can

be computed. Since the dimension of the matrix A. is equal to the
order of the autogressive model generating the disturbances (yhich will
usually be relatively small) and is not influenced by the length of the
gestation lag (which could be quite long), computation costs should be low
for this procedure.

. Properties

of Optimal Policy in a Second Order Cyclical Model

In this section we examine the properties of the optimal rules for the
case where sales disturbances y follow a second order process (.p=Z).

A second order model permits a fairly close approximation to the stochastic
properties of business cycles observed in most countries, if

y

interpreted as proportional to detrended fluctuations in real GNP or
some other measure of the state of aggregate economic activity.
For the second order model the optimal policy rules have the
form

(23)

cit =

+

i=l,...

which is a special case of equation (7). The control coefficients
and g.2 completely characterize the policy and of course are different
for each type of capital i.

The policy coefficients associated with i=l, the single period
projects, are obtained by solving equation (15) and are given by

(24)

g11 =

(25)

g12 =

If depreciation occurs in one period (h1=l) then the policy rules can be

characterized easily. In that case the policy reaction coefficients
are proportional to the parameters of the autoregressive process
For example if y is proportional to real GNP and

if real GNP has been

growing. For parameter values =l and v1d1=l, (24) and (25)

Cit

Note that it is never optimal to react only to current y unless
in which case the model is first—order model. As we show in the next
section failure to react to lagged y as in (26) can lead to

a policy rule which destabilizes output. According to equation (26)

invesent costs should be raised by an extra amount if the real GNP

has been growing.
The results are different if depreciation rates are smaller. The
proportionality of the g1. andcL. will no longer hold, and the size of

the reaction coefficients will be larger. Consider, for example the

opposite extreme where h0. The stabilization rule becomes

ci =

(27)

+ 5(y—yl).

The reaction coefficients are much larger than in (26) and the size of
the coefficient on the first difference of y is larger relative to the
size of the coefficient on the level of

Stochastic Simulation Results with Suboptimal Policies
The

optimal policy rules derived and examined in

sections have

the previous two

which are not usually characteristic of

stabilization policy in practice. First, the policy is dynamic:

seems to have been a- factor in the determination of

policy.

In practice only the

investment stabilization policy. Second, the policy instruments vary
tinuously

with the values of y. In practice the policy instruments are

likely to

be set discretely —

they are either on or off depending on the

state of the business cycle. Third, the policy instrument must be targetted
at the components of investment, distinguishing between different types of

capital by gestation time. If the instrument is not targetted to each type of
capital-, perhaps because of the restriction that

=

c.

for ij, then

there will be an insufficient number of instruments and a constrained opti—

mation approach is necessary. The methods developed in Chow (1980) might
be used in such a situation. In this section of the paper we examine through
the

to

use of

some simulation experiments what happens when policy is restricted

be suboptimal either because lagged values are omitted or because the

instrument

settings are limited to discrete values.

Omission of Lagged Variables

Consider the case where n1 and p2, and it is therefore optimal
for g12 to be nonzero. Suppose, however, that g12 is restricted to be
zero. In order to determine the possible impact of such a restricted
investment policy on the stability of investment, we performed stochastic

simulation for the set of parameter values for the intertemporal model

calculated in Taylor (1982). These values are v1=.2, d1=.07, h1=.026

and '.94. We also set al.4 and c2—.5 as in the previous section.
The variance of investment was then calculated by performing 1000

Monte Carlo simulations of 30 periods eacb, with the shocks u being
drawn from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1 and with

the path of investment being determined by the model. The simulations

—16—

were started from k1

=
0

o

The variance of investment was found to be

an increasing function of g11 for this set of autoregressive parameter

values. In the steady state (approximated at t=30), the variance of x1 was
equal to .00033 when g11 =

0, increased to .00047 at g11 = .002, and

increased further to .00076 when g11 = .004.

Hence, this type of

suboptimal policy could actually lead to perverse destabilization of
investment.-1This particular suboptimal policy is worse than no policy

at all. Note that for this example the optimal values for g11 and
are .090 and — .048 respectively.

Discrete Values for the Instruments

Consider the case where n=l and p=l. The optimal policy rule

then has the form c1 =

117.

Suppose, however, that only discrete

changes in c1 are feasible in practice, and

that

c1 is therefore

set according to the rule

c*

(28)

c

ify>0
0

For this policy the forecasts of investment Costs are not linear functions
of

as with the forecasting rules used in Section 2. Nevertheless

the forecast of c11 conditional on y, which is necessary for evaluating
the decision rule (4), can be evaluated for the case where u is normally

distributed. Using this conditional expectation for c11 and the rule
in (28) we stochastically simulated the model with the same parameter
values used for the previously described set of stochastic simulations.

—17—

The results are shown in the first column
in

Table

rule

1

of

Table 1. (The other columns

marked by the parameter 3 signify a different discrete policy

described

below). The results indicate that while there is some

reduction in the variance of investment with the discrete model, it is

very small. Moreover when the step size (c*) increases beyond some small
value the variance of investment begins to increase rapidly, indicating

the potential for some destabilization. The restriction of

c1 to a

discrete set of values results in a serious deterioration of theperfor—
mance

of

the policy.

One of the reasons for the poor results with this suboptimal policy

is that c1 moves by a large amount when y.deviates only slightly from
0. An improvement would therefore be expected if the rule

were modified

so that

(29)

cit =

With rule (29) small movements in

will

not

trigger a large response

in c1. Clearly equation (29) reduces to equation (28) when 3=0. The
simulation results for this alternative are shown in Table 1 in the
columns marked with different values of 3.

As expected there is some

reduction in the variance of x1 but not as much as would be possible
With the completely continuous optimal rule. Note also that Table 1

suggests that the best policy of the form (29) has 6 between .2 and

.3 and c* near .002. These values depend on the parameters used in

— 18 —

the simulation experiment, but they indicate the advantages of choosing
the step—size and trigger points Optimally even if policy is restricted to

a discrete set of values. To the extent that such constraints are important
in practice, further research to characterize how the best step—size and

trigger values depend on the parameters of the model in this and more
complicated examples would be useful.

6. Concluding Remarks
This paper has

considered

the problem of obtaining optimal control

rules for stabilizing investment fluctuations in a model where investment

demand depends on expected future values of the policy instruments. Simple
expressions for evaluating the control rules were derived using results

from prediction theory. These expressions were used to characterize some
of the main properties of the control rules. In addition, the loss from
using certain suboptimal rules was investigated. While

suboptimal

rules

are clearly inferior to optimal rules, aiid in some cases inferior to no

feedback rule at all, practical constraints on economic policy could lead
to the use of such rules.

Although

the formula for the control rule

was derived for

a particular

dynamic investment model, the prediction theory approach that was employed

could be used

in

other similar problems. The essential characteristic of

the control problem studied here is that the target variable depends on
forecasts of future values of the control instruments and on future exo—

genous variables. In the traditional control problem, the target variables
depend on current and lagged values of the control instruments and the

exogenous variables. This difference indicates why prediction theory is
particularly useful for the type of problem studied in this paper.

FOOTNOTES

1. See, for example, Lucas and Prescott (1971), Sargent (1979), Ch. 14,
and Kydland and Prescott (1980).

2. Policy questions relating to investment in dynamic models have been
addressed by Sargent (1979, p. 344), Kydland and Prescott (1980),

Suiers (1981), Hayashi (1982), and Taylor (1982). Lucas (1976)
addresses similar policy issues in a more general setting.

3. This approach to investment demand which emphasizes heterogeneous
gestation lags was applied to a Swedish investment problem in Taylor
(1982).

4. Where confusion does not arise, we generally omit a coiia between the
different indices in the double subscripts. No multiplication of subscript indices appears in this paper.

5. For example, in the United States the investment tax credit depends
on the useful

life

of the capital equipment purchased.

6. Christiano (1982) has shown analytically that such perverse destabilization can occur when

follows an ARNA(1,l) process. Baumol (1961)

and Howrey (1966) have investigated similar problems with suboptimal
policy rules in models where anticipations of future policy do not
affect decisions explicitly.
