The Lending Channel in Emerging Economics: Are Foreign Banks Different?

NBER Working Paper No. 12340
June 2006
JEL No. E51, G21
ABSTRACT
This paper assembles a dataset comprising 1,565 banks in 20 Asian and Latin American countries
during 1989-2001 and compares the response of the volume of loans, deposits, and bank-specific
interest rates on loans and deposits, to various measures of monetary conditions, across domestic and
foreign banks. It also looks for systematic differences in the behavior of domestic and foreign banks
during periods of financial distress and tranquil times. Using differences in bank ownership as a
proxy for financial constraints on banks, the paper finds weak evidence that foreign banks have a
lower sensitivity of credit to monetary conditions relative to their domestic competitors, with the
differences driven by banks with lower asset liquidity and/or capitalization. At the same time, the
lending and deposit rates of foreign banks tend to be smoother during periods of financial distress,
albeit the differences with domestic banks do not appear to be strong. These results provide weak
support to the existence of supply-side effects in credit markets and suggest that foreign bank entry
in emerging economies may have contributed somewhat to stability in credit markets.

I. INTRODUCTION
Foreign bank entry into emerging market economies has become an important component of
financial globalization since the mid-nineties. Facilitated by financial liberalization and the need
to recapitalize banking systems in the aftermath of financial crises, the volume of cross-border
mergers and acquisitions (M&As) targeting banks in emerging markets surged from about US$6
billion between 1990-1996, to almost US$50 billion—roughly one-third of the global amount—
between 1997-2000 (BIS 2004). The increase in foreign bank presence in emerging markets has
been uneven, entailing significant changes in the structure of bank ownership in many recipient
countries such as Mexico, where the share of banking system assets controlled by foreign
institutions increased from 2 percent in 1990 to 82 percent in 2004.
The speed and depth of foreign bank entry has potentially important implications for financial
and macroeconomic stability in recipient countries, and arguments have been made in both
directions. On the one hand, it has been argued that foreign banks could play a stabilizing role on
the supply of credit and deposits through upstream financing from their mother companies and
reputation effects, particularly during periods of financial distress. On the other, foreign banks
might be quick to pull out from emerging markets and could transmit external shocks into host
countries. Empirical evidence on the implications of foreign bank entry for financial and
macroeconomic stability in emerging markets, however, is limited to a paper by Dages,
Goldberg, and Kinney (2000) analyzing the behavior of domestic and foreign banks in Mexico
and Argentina during the Tequila crisis, and a paper by Detragiache and Gupta (2004), using
data for Malaysia during the Asian crisis. Overall, these two papers find mild support to the first
view. On the other hand, evidence from the 2002 crisis in Argentina seems to be more mixed,

2

with some foreign banks opting to exit in the context of a broader international asset relocation,
and others reducing their lending activities in line with the behavior of domestic banks.
At a more general level, the view that banks may play a non-trivial role in the transmission of
shocks into credit markets, via supply-side effects, has received considerable attention in the
literature of monetary policy transmission. Early work includes Bernanke and Blinder (1988),
Kashyap, et al. (1993), Bernanke and Gertler (1995), Kashyap and Stein (1995). The basic idea is
that financial constraints on banks impair their ability to offset negative shocks to deposits with
alternative financing sources, generating supply-side effects in credit markets, and amplifying
economic fluctuations. While the evidence seems to be broadly consistent with this proposal,
identifying suitable proxies for unobserved financial constraints on banks has been a key
challenge.
This paper builds on the idea that differences in bank ownership can serve as a proxy for
unobserved financial constraints on banks, and combined with other observable bank
characteristics (such as asset liquidity and capitalization) to identify changes in credit supply. To
implement this, it uses a panel dataset of 1,565 banks in 20 Asian and Latin American countries
during 1989-2001 and tests for systematic differences in the sensitivity of loans, deposits, and
bank-specific lending and deposit rates, to various measures of monetary conditions, across
domestic and foreign banks. It also looks for systematic differences in the behavior of domestic
and foreign banks during tranquil times and periods of financial distress, exploiting various
definitions of banking and currency crises available in the literature. The regions studied here are
relevant to the issues at hand, as they endured several financial crisis during the 1990s. In

3

addition, Latin America concentrated 48 percent of all cross-border M&A targeting banks in
emerging markets between 1991-2005, followed by Asia, with an additional 36 percent.
The results indicate that domestic and foreign banks behave roughly similarly along the
dimensions considered, providing only weak support to the existence of supply-side effects in
credit markets. In particular, loan and deposit growth are highly sensitive to economic activity, in
a manner that does not differ significantly across domestic and foreign banks. At the same time,
periods of tighter monetary conditions are associated with lower loan and deposit growth, with
foreign banks displaying a somewhat lower sensitivity. This finding is driven by banks with
relatively less liquid assets and/or lower capitalization, suggesting that it is not entirely
attributable to potential differences in the characteristics of the borrowers and depositors of
foreign banks. The results also show slight differences in the cross-sectional behavior of interest
rates. Lending and deposit rates of foreign banks tend to react less during periods of financial
distress. Taken together, these results indicate that foreign bank participation in emerging
economies has not lead to increased instability in credit markets, and may have even played a
beneficial effect.
The main contributions of the paper are as follows. First, it adds to the literature on the effects of
foreign bank entry on financial stability, exploiting a comprehensive bank-level panel dataset
that covers the main Latin American and emerging Asian countries during the nineties. The
paper tracks the evolution of bank ownership by crossing the sample of banks with a complete
list of mergers and acquisitions during the sample period. Second, it adds to the literature on the

4

lending channel outside the United States, particularly in emerging markets1 by exploiting
differences in bank ownership to identify supply-side effects in credit markets. As a by-product,
the paper provides a novel dataset on reserve requirements for the countries in the sample using
information from central bank reports.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II places the paper in the context of the
literature. Section III discusses the methodology and the hypotheses tested, as well as potential
endogeneity problems and sources of bias. Section IV describes the data. Section V compares the
response of selected financial variables (including loan growth, deposit growth, and bank-level
lending and deposit rates) to various measures of monetary conditions, across domestic and
foreign banks. Section VI focuses more closely on the response of loan growth to monetary
conditions across domestic and foreign banks after splitting the sample by capitalization and
liquidity levels. Section VII explores for systematic differences in the behavior of domestic and
foreign banks during tranquil and crises periods. Section VIII concludes.
II. RELATED LITERATURE
Most studies comparing the behavior of domestic and foreign banks in emerging economies
focus on the efficiency effects of foreign bank entry.2 An incipient strand of the literature, to
1

Studies in this area include: Edwards and Vegh (1997), who address the role of banks in the
transmission of nominal shocks in Mexico and Chile, Agung (1998) who examines Indonesia, a
volume edited by the BIS (1998) that looks at the lending channel in a sample of developing
countries, and a cross-country study by Vázquez (2001).

The evidence seems to indicate that competitive pressures caused by foreign entry have led to
improvements in banking system efficiency; for example, Barajas, Steiner, and Salazar (2000),
Claessens and Glaessner (1999), Claessens, Demirgüç-Kunt, and H. Huizinga (2001), and
Crystal, Dages, and Goldberg (2001).

5

which this paper belongs, looks at the effects of foreign bank entry on financial stability and the
response of credit markets to domestic and external shocks. Dages, Goldberg, and Kinney (2000)
compared the behavior of bank lending across domestic and foreign banks in Mexico and
Argentina during the Tequila crisis and concluded that foreign banks exhibited stronger and less
volatile loans growth than domestic banks, but differences in asset quality, rather than
ownership, appeared to be decisive in explaining the behavior of bank credit. Using data for
Malaysia, Detragiache and Gupta (2004), found evidence that foreign banks with sufficient
international diversification played a stabilizing role during the Asian crisis, while the behavior
of foreign banks with operations concentrated in Asia was roughly similar to the behavior of
domestic banks.
This paper is also related to the literature on the lending channel of monetary transmission,
which focuses on the potential role of banks propagating shocks via loan-supply effects. The
basic hypothesis is that capital market imperfections may prevent (at least some) banks from
freely substituting away a negative shock to deposits with other sources of funding. In
consequence, financially-constrained banks may optimally choose to cut lending in response to a
shock to deposits, thereby affecting the availability of funds to bank-dependent firms. The chief
obstacle in testing the lending channel is disentangling whether the response of credit to
monetary shocks originates from loan demand—as implied by interest rate channels—or from
changes in loan supply.
To get around the identification problem, empirical studies now generally resort to bank-level
data, testing for cross-sectional differences in the response of bank lending to monetary shocks
across banks with different degrees of financial constraints. Since financial constraints are not

6

directly observable, they have been usually proxied by bank characteristics such as liquidity,
size, and capitalization (for example, Jayaratne and Morgan (2000), Kishan and Opiela (2000),
Kashyap and Stein (2000)). Financial constraints have been also proxied by bank ownership.
Houston et al. (1997) explored the role of internal markets in banking in the U.S. and found that
the loan growth of bank subsidiaries is sensitive to the financial position of their holding
companies. A similar approach was implemented by Ashcraft (2000), who exploited a panel
database of U.S. banks and used bank affiliation with multi-bank holding companies to proxy for
financial constraints. In the international context, Peek and Rosengren (1997) looked at data on
Japanese banks operating in the United States and found that binding risk-based capital
requirements associated with the Japanese stock market decline of end-1980s translated into a
decline in lending by their U.S. branches.
This paper follows a similar approach, exploiting the presence of internal capital markets as a
source of cross-sectional variation between domestic and foreign banks. To the extent that
foreign banks are less financially-constrained than domestic banks, comparing the sensitivity of
loan growth to monetary conditions across domestic and foreign banks may identify supply-side
effects in credit markets. This test, however, hinges on the validity of two assumptions. First, all
else equal (i.e., capitalization, asset liquidity, and other bank characteristics), foreign banks have
to be less financially-constrained than domestic, either because they can resort to funding from
their parent institutions, or because they enjoy a more stable deposit base. Second, the loan
demand facing domestic banks cannot be systematically different than the loan demand of
foreign banks.

7

This identification strategy is implemented with the use of bank-level fixed effects regressions,
splitting the sample of banks between domestic and foreign with the use of a dummy variable. A
baseline exercise compares the response of selected balance sheet components to monetary
conditions across domestic and foreign banks, after controlling for changes in loan demand,
proxied by GDP growth, and observable bank characteristics such as size, liquidity and
capitalization. A second, more restrictive set of tests further explores systematic differences in
the response of loan growth to monetary conditions across domestic and foreign banks, in the
subsets of banks with lower liquidity and capitalization with respect to other banks in the same
country. Lastly, a third test uses various definitions of currency, banking and debt crises and
compares the behavior of domestic and foreign banks throughout crises and tranquil periods.
A few comments are convenient to place this paper in context. While the literature on the lending
channel focuses on the role of banks in the transmission of monetary policy to the credit market,
this paper takes a broader approach. It studies the effects of changes in monetary conditions on
the credit market, regardless of whether changes are induced, or not, by monetary policy. This
difference in emphasis is necessary since the paper focuses on emerging markets, where
monetary conditions are typically affected by an open capital account. Consequently, monetary
conditions here not only include money market rates, as usual in the lending channel literature,
but also international interest rates and the change of the foreign exchange rate, exploiting the
uncovered interest parity condition. The justification for the latter is straightforward, since
currency depreciation increases the opportunity cost of holding bank deposits denominated in
local currency, affecting their stability. Monetary conditions in this paper also include reserve
requirements which are safely ignored in the lending channel literature as they are not longer

8

used as a monetary policy tool in the United States. In contrast, reserve requirements as still are a
commonly used policy instrument in many emerging markets.3

III. METHODOLOGY
A series of tests were implemented to explore the response of selected balance sheet and income
statement components to changes in monetary conditions, across domestic and foreign banks,
after controlling for some observable bank characteristics. More specifically, the tests comprised
six separate specifications sharing the general form:
r

q

s =1

s =1

yi , c , t = α i + ∑ β s xc , t − s + ρzi , c , t −1 + ∑ δ s mc ,t − s + uit

[1]

where i=1,...,N refers to individual banks (panels), c=1,...,C to countries, and t=1,...,Ti to the time
dimension (the sample is unbalanced, so Ti varies across banks). The constants, αi, are the banklevel fixed effects.
Each specification used a different (bank-level) dependent variable, yict. A first set of regressions
employed quantity-related dependent variables: LOAN GROWTH, DEPOSIT GROWTH, the ratio of net
LOANS TO DEPOSITS.

A second set of regressions employed price-related dependent variables:

LENDING RATES, DEPOSIT RATES,

and LENDING MINUS DEPOSIT SPREADS. Loan and deposit growth

were computed by first differencing the logarithm of the corresponding series, measured in
constant (1995) local currency units. Bank-specific lending and deposit rates were estimated by
combining information from income statements and balance sheets. Specifically, lending rates

requirements in a small open economy.

9

were obtained by dividing interest revenues over average loan volume, and deposit rates were
obtained by dividing interest expenses over average deposit volume. The spreads between
lending and deposit rates were computed as the difference between these two. Admittedly, these
variables are noisy indicators of the target series, as interest revenues include interests received
from investments, while interest expenses are affected by interests paid on liabilities other than
deposits. These, however, seem to be the best available indicators of bank-specific interest rates.
The vector x contains country-level variables, aimed to control for changes in loan demand. Here
the specification includes GDP GROWTH, also measured in 1995 local currency. The vector z
contains bank-level characteristics to control for financial constraints. Following a standard
practice in the monetary transmission literature, three indicators were used: a measure of bank
size, an indicator of asset liquidity, and an indicator of bank capitalization. Regarding bank size,
the presumption is that bigger banks face lower external finance premiums and are thus better
equipped to substitute away a negative shock to deposits with other sources of financing. To
eliminate possible trends in bank SIZE, the estimation uses a relative measure, computed as the
difference between the log of assets of a bank in a given year (in 1995 local currency) and the
average computed over all banks in the same country and year:

Sizei, c,t = ln( Assetsi, c,t ) −

∑i∈c ln( Assetsi,c,t )
N c, t

, for c=1,...,C

Where Nct stands for the number of banks in country c in year t. Therefore, the resulting measure
is a normalized variable with zero mean for each country and year. The second variable, asset

10

LIQUIDITY,

was computed as the proportion of liquid assets to total assets.4 The inclusion of this

variable follows the presumption that banks with more liquid assets are better positioned to meet
loan demand in the face of unexpected shocks to deposits. The third variable, CAPITALIZATION,
was defined as equity capital over total assets. The presumption is that better-capitalized banks
tend to pay lower risk premiums on non-insured debt and, therefore, face lower financing
restrictions. These two variables were normalized with respect to the sample averages of each
country. For example, the transformation applied to liquidity was:

Liquidityi , c ,t = Liquidityi , c ,t −

∑ ∑ Liquidity
t

i

i ,c,t

Nc

Where Nc is the number of observations in country c over the whole period. Capitalization was
treated similarly. Potential endogeneity problems and sources of bias associated with these
variables are discussed below.
Going back to the specification, the vector m contains two measures of monetary conditions.
First, the evolution of liquidity in the banking system was captured by the interest rates on shortterm lending between financial institutions, MONEY MARKET RATES. Second, the evolution of
required reserves was tracked with RESERVE REQUIREMENTS, an indicator variable constructed on
the basis of central bank reports (see Appendix 1 to 3 for details). This indicator was allowed to
vary on a scale from 1 to 5, with a larger number indicating higher reserve requirements.5 A

4

Liquid assets include cash and reserves, government bonds, and other marketable securities.

5

The indicator relied on judgment, as the structure of reserve requirements can be quite
complicated (i.e., they can be defined on marginal vs. average deposits, and differentiated by
deposit types).

11

comparison between these two variables on a country-by-country basis suggests that they convey
complementary information on monetary conditions (Figures 1 and 2).
As a robustness check, an alternative set of monetary conditions were used exploiting the
uncovered interest parity. In particular, MONEY MARKET RATES were replaced by two variables:
the yearly percent change of the average market exchange rate, DEPRECIATION, and the threemonth U.S. Treasury bill rate, T-BILL. The inclusion of these two variables follows from the fact
that all countries studied here are small open economies, and the stability of bank deposits may
be influenced by developments in the foreign exchange market.
In all the regressions, the target parameters are the coefficients of the monetary conditions (i.e.,
the δ’s). Differences across domestic and foreign banks were tested by interacting each
explanatory variable with a dummy FOREIGN, which equals one for foreign banks and zero for
domestic. An additional, more restrictive test was also implemented by further splitting the
sample by bank characteristics. In particular, dummy variables were created to separate banks
with lagged capitalization above the 75th percentile with respect to the sample of banks operating
in the same country. Similarly, another set of dummy variables was created to separate banks
with lagged liquidity above the 75th percentile with respect to the rest of banks in the same
country. As a by-product, the coefficients associated with GDP growth (the β’s) also allow to
explore for systematic differences in the cyclical behavior of the selected endogenous variables,
across domestic and foreign banks.
Separate regressions were estimated for Asia and Latin America on the notion that differences in
macroeconomic performance and banking practices between these two regions render the
population parameters different. It is well recognized, for example, that foreign bank entry into

12

emerging markets has led to the emergence of "regional evolvers", that is, banks that use their
relative advantages in a region (i.e., historic and cultural links with host countries) to focus their
international expansion, as in the case of Spanish banks in Latin America and Japanese banks in
East Asia.

A. Expected Results

Consider the set of regressions dealing with quantity-related endogenous variables (i.e., loans
and deposits). The first specification provides a test for the sensitivity of LOAN GROWTH to
changes in monetary conditions. Under the lending channel hypothesis, financially-constrained
banks are expected to be more sensitive to monetary conditions, implying that the coefficients
associated with domestic banks are higher in absolute value (i.e., more negative) than those for
foreign banks. The second specification further explores for differences in the sensitivity of
DEPOSIT GROWTH

to monetary conditions across domestic and foreign banks. If banks have the

capacity to adjust their deposit rates to partially offset a negative shock to deposits, the lending
channel hypothesis would imply a lower sensitivity of deposits to monetary conditions for more
financially-constrained banks—as they are less capable to substitute them with other sources of
funds. The third specification is a combination of the previous two. It checks for the sensitivity
of LOAN TO DEPOSIT ratios to changes in monetary conditions. The lending channel hypothesis
implies that the associated coefficient has to be non-significant for more financially-constrained
banks, and positive for less financially-constrained banks, since the later would tend to finance a
lower proportion of loans with customer deposits in response to tighter monetary conditions.

13

Consider now the models with price-related endogenous variables (i.e., deposit rates, lending
rates, and lending minus deposit spreads). The lending channel hypothesis implies that
financially-constrained banks display a larger response of lending and deposit rates to monetary
conditions. Moreover, the lending minus deposit spread is expected to increase under tighter
monetary conditions for financially-constrained banks. This is because, in response to a negative
shock to deposits, banks would try to resort to alternative forms of financing, increasing their
premium on non-insured debt and, by cost minimization, their equilibrium deposit rates. This
increase would tend to be translated more than proportionally into lending rates due to the taxlike effect of reserve requirements on insured deposits and the cost of maintaining precautionary
liquid assets.
B. Sources of Bias and Endogeneity Problems

As with any reduced-form estimations, there are potential endogeneity problems and bias
associated with the use of bank characteristics (i.e., size, liquidity, and capitalization). Regarding
size, there is possible joint determination since a bank may actually become larger precisely
because of large deposit (and loan) growth. Regarding capitalization, a financially-constrained
bank may choose to be more capitalized, eroding the usefulness of this indicator as a measure of
financial constraints. In fact, as shown below, balance sheet data indicates that capitalization
decreases systematically with bank size, suggesting that it may be a poor indicator of financial
constraints on banks. A similar problem arises with the use of liquidity ratios. A bank may
optimally choose to have a more liquid asset structure to compensate for higher financial
constraints. Again, it is unclear whether a less liquid asset structure is a clear-cut indicator of

14

higher financial constraints. To reduce these endogeneity problems, the regressions use lagged
values of bank-level characteristics.
A related problem, spurious correlation induced by mean-reversion may arise from the use of
liquidity ratios as defined. To see why, suppose that bank assets are composed only of liquid
instruments and loans. In this simplified balance sheet, a bank with higher-than-average liquid
assets in period t-1 will tend to display a higher-than-average loan growth in year t. Thus
interacting monetary conditions with a liquidity indicator will tend to erode the power of the test,
biasing the results in favor of the lending channel hypothesis (i.e., banks with more liquid
balance sheets having a lower sensitivity of loan growth to monetary disturbances). This problem
can be avoided by choosing a different scaling variable. For example, liquid assets could be
scaled by total deposits, which in fact seems to be the relevant measure if deposits are the main
source of shocks to bank's liabilities. For comparative purposes, this paper computes liquidity in
the usual way (scaling liquid assets by total assets), but an additional exercise was implemented
using deposits as the scaling variable with similar qualitative results.

IV. DATA

Macro data come from the International Financial Statistics. The series include MONEY MARKET
RATES

(series 60b), the yearly percent change of the average market exchange rate,

DEPRECIATION (series

rf), the three-month U.S. Treasury bill rate, T-BILL (series 11160c), and

15

GDP GROWTH (series 99b), expressed in constant (1995) local currency units using consumer
price indexes (series 64).6
Bank-level data (i.e., financial statements) come from the Bankscope database. Series are yearly,
covering a sample of 1,565 banks in 20 countries during 1989-2001. The sample of countries
includes all major Latin American and Southeast Asian countries.7 Comparing the behavior of
domestic and foreign banks in this sample offers a rich experiment, since it covers pre- and postentry years, as well as several banking and balance of payment crisis. In total, the sample has
8,574 observations, distributed across time and countries as shown in Table 1. The decrease in
the number of banks in Asia after 1997 reflects the consolidation process following the Asian
crisis.
Using the Bankscope database has two major advantages. First, the coverage is fairly
comprehensive, with sampled banks accounting for about 90 percent of total assets in each
country, according to the source. Second, the accounting information at the bank level is
presented in standardized form, after making adjustments for differences in accounting and
reporting standards across countries. On the other hand, the data has some limitations. First, there
is a sample-selection bias in favor of large banks which weakens somewhat its usefulness, as
small banks may tend to be more financially constrained than large banks. Second, the data do
6

For countries with incomplete or unavailable information on money market rates, an alternative
indicator was used. Deposit rates (series 60L) were used for Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Panamá,
Paraguay, and Venezuela; the call money rate (series 60) was used for India; the one-month
average interbank offer rate for Hong Kong; and the interbank rate for Taiwan.

7

For Latin America, the list of countries includes: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia,
Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. For East Asia: Hong Kong, India,
Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Taiwan.

16

not provide a breakdown of loan portfolios by sectors or by borrower types, precluding the use of
controls for bank-specific changes in loan demand. Third, the data do not provide information on
the currency composition of loans and deposits, which could be a potentially useful source of
cross-sectional variation in the open economy context.
While in many cases Bankscope reports both consolidated and unconsolidated financial
statements, this paper uses unconsolidated figures to the extent possible, to reduce variations
arising from changes in subsidiaries' ownership and to work with comparable accounting data.
From the original source, unconsolidated figures were available in all but 73 cases. For the
purposes of the exercises below, balance sheet figures were converted into constant 1995 local
currency using consumer price indexes (series 64 of the IMF: International Financial Statistics).
Series in constant 1995 US$ were also computed using the average market exchange rate for
each country (series rf of the IMF: International Financial Statistics).
Outliers were identified through the application of several filters, including limits on the yearly
change in total assets, on the yearly growth rate of loans and deposits, and on the ratio of net
loans to deposits. Few cases with other data deficiencies and with negative equity were also
removed.8

8

Specifically, the following filters were used. First, 31 observations where yearly asset growth in
constant US$ exceeded 200 percent in absolute terms were removed. Second, 57 cases where the
yearly loan growth exceeded 300 percent in absolute terms, and 77 cases where the yearly
deposit growth exceeded 300 percent in absolute terms were also removed. Third, 27 cases
where loans represented more than 100 times the value of deposits were removed. Finally, 66
cases with negative deposits and 94 cases with negative equity capital were also removed. In
total, 316 observations were eliminated, as some of the filters affected the same observations.

17

The identification of foreign banks in each country was achieved through several complementary
steps aimed to minimize misclassifications. A bank was classified as “foreign” in a given year if
it had at least 51 percent of its capital in the hands of residents of industrial OECD countries (i.e.,
excluding Mexico and Korea). The ownership structure at the end of 2001, for each bank in the
sample, was obtained from Bankscope and from central banks. To reconstruct backwards the
chronological evolution of ownership throughout the period, the list of banks was intersected
with a comprehensive list of mergers and acquisitions targeting financial institutions in the
sampled countries (a detailed description is given in Appendix 4). Due to data limitations, no
distinction was made between subsidiaries and branches of foreign banks—an otherwise relevant
separation, to the extent that subsidiaries’ access to capital from their parent institutions may not
be automatic, as in the case of branches.
Descriptive evidence on the structure of balance sheets across regions and bank sizes is presented
in Table 2. No clear patterns arise in the balance sheets of banks operating in Latin America. On
the other hand, banks operating in Asia display some regularities similar to those reported in
Kayshap and Stein (1994). In particular, larger banks tend to have a higher proportion of loans to
assets, and they rely more on non-deposit financing, and less on equity. These patterns have been
interpreted as consistent with the presence of imperfect substitution between deposits and other
sources of financing, especially for smaller banks. If small banks cannot completely offset
shocks to deposits with other financing sources, they will optimally hold a buffer stock of liquid
assets to reduce the costs of early loan liquidation. In equilibrium, they will also tend to rely less
in non-deposit financing and more on internal capital.

18

This presumption can be further checked by splitting the sample across domestic and foreign
banks. Foreign banks could be more aggressive in lending if they have access to internal
financial resources from their mother institutions. Also, they could have systematic differences in
the liability structure of their balance sheets with respect to domestic banks. Table 3 presents
summary statistics on loan growth, deposit growth, and several indicators of the structure of
balance sheets for domestic and foreign banks, and by regions. On average, foreign banks in
Latin America have higher rates of deposit and loan growth than domestic banks, but the
opposite holds true for Asia. In general, there are not strong differences in the structure of
balance sheets structure across domestic and foreign banks, so the data does not seem to fit into
the hypothesized pattern.
V. BASELINE RESULTS

The results of baseline regressions for the Asian and Latin American sub-samples are presented
in Tables 4 and 5. Given the nature of the data, which combines a cross-section and a time-series
dimension, the equations were estimated with Generalized Least Squares (GLS) to accommodate
possible autocorrelation within panels and heteroscedasticity across panels. The estimation
allowed for panel-specific AR(1) processes. Cross-sectional correlations between panels were
not considered since the number of panels is much larger than the time series dimension.
For each sub-sample, six regressions were computed, using identical specifications except for the
dependent variables. Those presented in the first three columns are quantity-related (LOAN
GROWTH, DEPOSIT GROWTH,

and LOAN TO DEPOSIT ratios), and those in columns four to six are

price-related (LENDING RATES, DEPOSIT RATES, and LENDING MINUS DEPOSIT spreads). To
facilitate reading, the explanatory variables are divided in two panels. The upper panel includes

19

GDP GROWTH and the bank-level controls, while the lower panel groups the monetary
conditions. To compare the responses across domestic and foreign banks, all the explanatory
variables were interacted with a dummy variable, FOREIGN, which equals one for foreign banks
and zero otherwise. Robust standard errors are reported in square brackets.
In the first two columns, the results show that loan and deposit growth tend to be highly
procyclical (especially the former), with no statistically significant differences across domestic
and foreign banks. A similar result was obtained in Dages, Goldberg and Kinney (2000) for
Mexico and Argentina. In addition, banks with higher asset liquidity or capitalization at the end
of the previous year tend to display stronger loan growth, with some indication that the response
is larger among the subset of foreign banks. Going to the lower panel, loan growth decelerates in
response to tighter monetary conditions, with some support for the view that loan growth of
foreign banks tends to be less sensitive to changes in money market rates. Interestingly, the
results in the third column indicate that loans and deposits move one-for-one at the one year
frequency, independently of the economic cycle, monetary conditions, and bank characteristics,
including ownership.
Going to columns four to six, the upper panel shows that deposit rates tend to be countercyclical,
with some evidence suggesting that this is less intense in the case of foreign banks in the Asian
sub-sample. Banks with higher liquidity tend to pay lower deposit rates and also charge lower
interest spreads, a result that appears to be mainly attributable to changes in lending rates.
However, no significant differences arise between domestic and foreign banks. In the lower
panel, periods of tight monetary conditions are associated with higher lending and deposit rates,
with inconclusive results in terms of spreads (for example, spreads go up for the Latin American

20

sub-sample, and decrease for the Asian sub-sample). In the Asian sub-sample, foreign banks tend
to display a lower sensitivity of lending and deposit rates to changes in monetary conditions.
Overall, the results tend to provide only weak support to the lending channel hypothesis. In
particular, loan growth of foreign banks is less sensitive to money market rates in both Asia and
Latin America, and some evidence suggests that deposits on foreign banks are also less sensitive
to monetary conditions (in the Latin America sub-sample). On the other hand, the results show
no statistically significant differences in the response of loan growth to changes in reserve
requirements across domestic and foreign banks. All these results were qualitatively robust to the
removal of 58 banks changing ownership during the period.
VI. A CLOSER LOOK TO LOAN GROWTH

This section focuses more closely on the response of loan growth to monetary conditions given
its importance in the monetary transmission mechanism. The regressions parallel those presented
before, but adding interacting terms between bank ownership and other bank characteristics. In
particular, besides partitioning the sample across domestic and foreign banks, the sample was
first split by capitalization, separating banks with capitalization above (and below) the 75th
percentile with respect other banks operating in the same country.9 Second, the sample was split
by asset liquidity, separating banks above (and below) the 75th liquidity percentile with respect to
other banks operating in the same country. Subject to the caveats discussed above, banks with
stronger capitalization and more liquid assets could be considered to be less financially-

9

In other words, the percentiles of capitalization were computed on a country-by-country basis,
and the sample was partitioned between banks above (and below) the 75th percentile.

21

constrained, and therefore better equipped to isolate loan growth from changes in monetary
conditions. Therefore, the differences between domestic and foreign banks reported before are
expected to be larger in the sub-samples of banks with lower liquidity and/or capitalization.
Summary results of three sets of regressions, using LOAN GROWTH as dependent variable, are
presented in Tables 6 and 7. To facilitate the reading, the only coefficients reported are those
associated with the monetary conditions (i.e., MONEY MARKET RATE and RESERVE
REQUIREMENTS).

The upper panel displays the results of the regressions covering the whole

sample (and are therefore identical to those presented before). The regression in the middle panel
splits the sample by bank ownership and capitalization, and the regression in the lower panel
splits the sample by bank ownership and liquidity. Each panel displays the coefficients of
domestic banks alongside the matching coefficients for foreign banks, and the p-values for the
null(s) of coefficient equality between square brackets.
Going to the upper panel, the coefficients associated with the money market rate are statistically
significant and have the expected (negative) sign for domestic banks, but are not different from
zero in the case of foreign banks. As discussed before, the null of coefficient equality across
domestic and foreign banks can be rejected in both the Latin American and the Asian subsamples. The results in the two lower panels indicate that loan growth of banks with lower
capitalization and/or liquidity tend to be more sensitive to changes in money market rates in the
two sub-samples. While this applies to both domestic and foreign banks, the coefficients of the
latter are not significantly different from zero in most cases. A stricter comparison indicates that
the null of coefficient equality across domestic and foreign banks can be rejected only when the
sample is partitioned by liquidity, but not by capitalization, with the evidence providing some

22

support to the lending channel hypothesis. On the other hand, a look at the coefficients
associated with reserve requirements indicates that, while they have the expected negative sign,
their standard errors are too large and the null of coefficient equality between domestic and
foreign banks cannot be rejected in most cases.
As a complementary exercise, parallel regressions were computed using an alternative set of
indicators of monetary conditions. The new set also included reserve requirements, but replaced
money market rates with the nominal exchange rate depreciation and international interest rates
(proxied by the federal funds rate). The results, presented in Tables 8 and 9 are roughly
comparable to those reported above, providing some evidence in support of the lending channel
hypothesis. In both sub-samples, loan growth decelerates with exchange rate depreciation, with
foreign banks generally displaying a lower sensitivity. Moreover, the differences appear to be
driven by less liquid and/or less capitalized banks.
The coefficients associated with reserve requirements and the federal funds rate are less
conclusive. For the Latin American sub-sample both coefficients have the expected (negative)
sign but the standard errors are too high to be conclusive, and there are no significant differences
across domestic or foreign banks. For the Asian sub-sample, foreign banks display a larger
sensitivity to reserve requirements than domestic, which runs contrary to expectations, while the
coefficients of the federal funds rate are either not significant or have the wrong sign. Similar
results were obtained using the money market rates of Japan and Australia as alternative
measures of international interest rates, possibly reflecting the fact that Asian countries were
mostly non-reliant on foreign capital inflows.

23

Summing up, the results indicate that loan growth of well capitalized and/or more liquid banks is
less sensitive to changes in monetary conditions. While in most cases the differences between
domestic and foreign banks are not statistically significant, a few exceptions tend to support the
lending channel hypothesis.
The results obtained so far implicitly assume that the behavior of domestic and foreign banks is
regular during tranquil times and during periods of financial distress. Differences in the behavior
of domestic and foreign banks (and their depositors), however, could be magnified during
periods of financial distress. The next section provides a closer look into this.
VII. ARE FOREIGN BANKS DIFFERENT DURING CRISIS PERIODS?

A related comparison between domestic and foreign banks can be performed by separating
tranquil periods and episodes of financial distress. Arguably, the latter entail larger financial
constraints on banks, as well as changes in depositors’ behavior that may induce relocations of
deposits toward larger or sounder banks. Therefore, potential asymmetries in financial
constraints across domestic and foreign banks would tend to increase during crises periods,
especially if foreign banks are perceived as safer than domestic. The sample of countries
included in this study offers a rich information set to address this issue, since half of them
undergo some type of financial crisis during the nineties.
To implement this exercise, three types of (related) crises are considered: currency, banking, and
debt crises. The definitions of each type of crises, and the series, are borrowed from previous
studies. A first exercise exploits the currency and banking crises defined in Kamisnsky and

24

Reinhart (1999),10 and the debt crises provided in Detragiache and Spilimbergo (2001).11 As in
the original series, each crisis variable is a dummy that takes the value of one at the crisis year
and zero elsewhere.
A first pass at the evidence is provided with the help of a set of crisis windows spanning three
years and centered around banking, currency, or debt crisis. The close relationship between these
three types of crises—both within and between countries—tends to produce clustering, and
therefore the size of the window exceeds the three-year period in many countries. For example,
the Mexican currency crisis of 1994 was preceded by a banking crisis in 1992, and therefore the
associated crisis window spans over five years (1991-1995). Similarly, the Venezuelan currency
crisis of 1994-1995 was preceded by a banking crisis that started in 1993, and thus the crisis
window also spans over five years (1992-1996). In other cases, such as Malaysia and Philippines
during the 1997 Asian Crisis, the currency and banking crises occurred simultaneously, and the
crisis window covers three years (1996-1998).

10

In Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999), the dating of currency crises is based on an index of
currency market turbulence, computed as a weighted average of exchange rate changes and
reserve changes. A currency crisis occurs when the index reaches (or surpasses) three standard
deviations above the mean. In turn, (the beginning of) a banking crisis is defined by two types of
events: (i) bank runs that lead to the closure, merging, or takeover by the public sector of one or
more financial institutions; or (ii) if there are no runs, the closure, merging, takeover, or largescale government assistance of an important financial institution (or group of institutions) that
marks the start of a string of similar outcomes for other financial institutions.

11

In Detragiache and Spilimbergo (2001), a debt crisis occurs when either (or both) of the
following conditions occur: (i) there are arrears of principal or interest on external obligations
towards commercial creditors (banks or bondholders) of more than 5 percent of total commercial
debt outstanding; (2) there is a rescheduling or debt restructuring agreement with commercial
creditors as listed in the Global Development Finance (World Bank Debt Tables).

25

Figure 3 presents the behavior of loan growth across domestic and foreign banks for each
country, both during crises and tranquil periods.12 The graphs illustrate two results. First, not
surprisingly, loan growth decreases sharply at the beginning of the crisis window and tend to
recover toward the end. Second, the behavior of loan growth across domestic and foreign banks
is remarkable similar, even during periods of financial distress .
A more systematic test comparing the behavior of domestic and foreign banks across crises and
tranquil periods was performed by running panel regressions with bank-level fixed effects, and
splitting the sample of banks between domestic and foreign with the use of a dummy variable.
The results, presented in Tables 10 and 11 are qualitatively similar for the Asian and Latin
American sub-samples. The first two columns indicate that both loan and deposit growth
decrease during crises periods, with mild or not significant differences between domestic and
foreign banks, with the exception of deposit growth in Asia, which shows a larger contraction for
the subset of foreign banks. The third column, which uses the ratio of loans to deposits as
dependent variable, indicates that the proportion of loans financed though deposits remains
roughly constant during crises periods. In other words, changes in loans are matched one-for-one
by changes in deposits both during crises and tranquil periods, and this tends to apply equally to
domestic and foreign banks.
Interestingly, differences across domestic and foreign banks during crises periods appear to be
related to the behavior of interest rates. The regressions presented in the fifth and sixth columns
indicate that bank-specific deposit and lending rates increase during crises periods, with a
12

Loan growth was computed as the median taken over all banks operating in the same country
in a given year.

26

smoother patterns for foreign banks. The behavior of bank spreads during crises periods,
however, is less conclusive, and the results in all cases show no differences between domestic
and foreign banks.
A potential drawback of these results is that they are obtained from a crisis window that may be
too large, as differences in the behavior of domestic and foreign banks may tend to disappear as
the size of the crisis window increases. To take this into account, the same regressions were
computed again using a slightly richer set of crisis variables. Specifically, three yearly dummy
variables were created to isolate potential differences in bank behavior around crisis episodes.
The first variable, CRISIS T-1, equals one for the year preceding the crisis and zero elsewhere, the
second, CRISIS T, equals one in the year of the crisis and zero elsewhere, and the third, CRISIS
T+1, equals one for the year immediately after the crisis and zero elsewhere. The behavior of
domestic and foreign banks around, and during crisis periods, was then compared.
The results displayed in the first two columns of Tables 12 and 13 indicate both loan growth and
deposit growth tend to be slightly above average in the year preceding the onset of the crises, and
sharply collapse immediately after, with mild evidence indicating a less pronounced decline of
credit in the case of foreign banks operating in Latin America, but the opposite in Asia. Looking
at the third column, the ratio of loans to deposits tends to decrease during and after crises
episodes, but the differences with tranquil periods tend to be insignificant. In other words, the
data strongly indicates that loans and deposits of both domestic and foreign banks move one-toone during tranquil and crises periods.
Going to the last three columns, lending rates increase above average one year before the crises,
and remain high thereafter (within the crises window considered). Deposit rates, on the other

27

hand, appear to react more sluggishly, since they do not increase significantly during the year
preceding the crises.
To check the sensitivity of the results, the regressions were computed again using two alternative
definitions of banking crises: Frankel and Rose (1996), and Caprio and Kinglebiel (1996).
Summary results of these regressions, provided in Tables 14 and 15, support the previous
conclusions, in the sense that no systematic differences in loan and deposit growth arise between
domestic and foreign banks, regardless of the operational definition of crises employed. On the
other hand, the behavior of deposit and lending rates across domestic and foreign banks tends to
differ during crises periods, with foreign banks displaying, in general, a somewhat lower
sensitivity to market conditions.

VIII. CONCLUDING REMARKS

The increase of foreign bank presence in emerging markets has generated debate on its potential
effects on financial stability and the transmission of domestic and external shocks into credit
markets. The results reported in this paper tend to fall on neutral grounds. There is some
evidence that loan growth of foreign banks is less sensitive to changes in monetary conditions in
host countries, a result driven by banks with lower asset liquidity and/or capitalization. Among
the group of banks with stronger balance sheets, however, there is a strong similarity in the
response of loans and deposits to monetary conditions across domestic and foreign banks.
These findings offer some evidence supporting the existence of supply-side effects in credit
markets, provided that differences in bank ownership are a good proxy for financial constraints
on banks, and that no systematic differences arise in loan demand across domestic and foreign

28

banks. While the latter may be unlikely, the fact that the differences are driven by less liquid
and/or less capitalized banks offers an additional support.
At a more general level, the results indicate that foreign bank participation in emerging markets
has not led to increased instability in credit markets. The response of credit to economic activity
and monetary conditions seems to be roughly similar across domestic and foreign banks.
Differences, if any, appear to be more closely related to the behavior of interest rates. In
particular, deposit and lending rates of foreign banks tend to be less sensitive to changes in
monetary conditions, and smoother during periods of financial turmoil in host countries, which
suggest that foreign banks may have an advantage over their domestic peers in attracting
deposits.

This Table presents the results of GLS panel regressions with bank-level fixed effects, and allowing for panel-specific AR(1) errors. The sample comes from the
Bankscope database and covers banks operating in selected Latin American countries from 1989-2001. Robust standard errors are reported between square
brackets. Statistical significance at one, five, and ten percent level, are indicated by ***, **, *, respectively. Six models are considered, each one presented in a
separate column. Each model uses a different dependent variable, specified in the first row of the Table. All models share the same set of explanatory variables,
including country-level controls (GDP growth), bank-level controls (bank size, bank liquidity, and bank capitalization), and two indicators of monetary conditions
(an index that tracks the evolution of reserve requirements, and the money market rate). The sample is split across domestic and foreign banks with the use of a
dummy ("Foreign") which equals one for foreign banks and zero otherwise.

(an index that tracks the evolution of reserve requirements, and the money market rate). The sample is split across domestic and foreign banks with the use of a
dummy ("Foreign") which equals one for foreign banks and zero otherwise.

This table presents selected coefficients from six sets of fixed-effects panel regressions. In all cases, the dependent variable is
loan growth in constant local currency units. The reported coefficients are those associated with monetary conditions, measured
by money market rates and an indicator of reserve requirements (which goes from 1 to 5 where a higher number indicates higher
reserves). Controls, not reported here, include GDP growth and a set of bank characteristics (size, asset liquidity and
capitalization). The table is divided in three panels. The upper displays the results of the regression based on the whole sample.
The middle panel reports the results of two regressions, splitting the sample between banks with capitalization above (and below)
the 75 percentile relative to other banks operating in the same country. The lower panel follows a similar structure, but the
sample is split by liquidity levels. The estimation is based on GLS, allowing for panel-specific AR(1) processes.
Standard errors between parenthesis. * significant at 10%; ** significant at 10%; *** significant at 1%. The p-values
coresponding to the null of coefficient equality across domestic and foreign banks between [square] brackets.

This table reports selected coefficients from a set of 18 panel regressions that compare the behavior of bank loans, deposits, and
interest rates, across domestic and foreign banks, around periods of financial crises. The sample covers 11 Latin American countries
during 1989-2001. Each column covers 3 separate regressions that share the same dependent variable, described in the first row, and
the same set of (unreported) bank-level controls: size, liquidity, and capitalization. Bank-level controls were lagged one period to
reduce potential endogeneity problems. The reported coefficients correspond to a set of dummy variables, generically labeled as "T1", "T", and "T+1". Those labeled with "T" equal one during banking crises and zero elsewhere. Correspondingly, "T-1" equal one a
year before financial crises and zero elsewhere, and "T+1" equal one a year after banking crises, and zero elsewhere. To provide
sensitivity analysis, three alternative definitions of banking crises were used: Caprio-Kinglebiel, Frankel-Rose, and KaminskyReinhart. These are reported in the upper-, middle-, and lower-panel, respectively.
In order to compare the behavior of domestic and foreign banks, each explanatory variable was interacted with a "foreign bank"
dummy. All regressions were computed with bank-level fixed effects and robust standard errors, reportes between square brackets. *,
**, ***, indicate significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent level, respectively.

HOW DO WE ASSIGN THE FINAL SCALE?

1)

For each country, we specify the policy instrument used to construct the reserve requirement index. Most cases use the reserve requirement on
demand deposits (first criterium).

2)

During years with one or more changes in reserve requirements, the index reflects the weighted average of its intra-year values, using the relative
time of the policy regimes as weights.

3)

In cases where reserve requirements on demand deposits in domestic currency were not applicable, or did not show variation, a parallel policy
instrument (such as liquidity requirements, reserve requirements on foreign currency deposits, etc.) was also used (second criterium). The list of
policy instruments used for each country is presented in Appendix 2.

Reserve Requirements
To stabilize the money markets and reduce fluctuations of short-term interest rates, the BOT
modified the computacional procedure of commercial bank's reserve requirements.
In August, non-resident bath deposits with maturity of less than one year are subject to a 7%
minimum reserve requirement in the form of deposits (with no interest) with the BOT.
While reserve requirements on domestic deposits were also 7%, they could be held in the form
of interest-bearing public bonds.
In September, the BOT reduced the liquidity requirement ratio on total deposits from 7 % to 6%.
For finance companies the liquidity requirement on total domestic and foreign borrowing was
reduced from 7% to 6%. This was also applied to non-resident deposits, or foreign borrowing
with maturity of less than one year.
The BOT announced new rules on liquidity reserve requirement composition and procedure,
but not changes in rates.
No changes.

APPENDIX 4. ALGORITHM TO TRACK THE EVOLUTION OF BANK OWNERSHIP

This Appendix describes the algorithm used to reconstruct the evolution of bank ownership.
Ideally, the objective is to identify foreign institutions involved in retail banking and with
access to upstream financing from their mother banks.13 This is the case of branches of
foreign banks, which can obtain resources from their mother institutions as needed. This may
also be the case of subsidiaries of foreign banks, although the availability of upstream
resources in this case is not guaranteed. In this paper a bank is considered "foreign" if it is a
branch of a bank incorporated in a foreign country, or if it has shareholders settled in a
foreign country, holding together at least 51 percent of the bank capital.
The above operational definition was applied in four steps. First, the Bankscope search
engine was used to identify subsidiaries of banks from OECD countries. Those with more
than 51 percent of ownership in the hands of foreign banks were selected. This search
identified 304 banks at least partially owned by banks from OECD countries. Of those, 189
had more than 51 percent in the hands of banks headquartered in OECD countries. Second, to
verify the above list, the search engine of Bankscope was used to identify the shareholders of
the sampled banks. Specifically, banks with shareholders settled in OECD countries, holding
together at least 51 percent of the bank capital were filtered. In cases with no available
information on percentage ownership, banks with one or more shareholders from OECD
countries, and with local shareholders holding together less than 50 percent of the bank's

13

In practice, both the nature of the services provided by foreign banks, and their access to
upstream resources, depend on the institutional modality of entry. The most commonly used
are representative offices, branches, subsidiaries, and joint ventures.

capital, were also selected. These filtering criteria produced 313 cases. Of those, 171 were
common to the 189 mentioned above, and taken as foreign banks without further check. The
remaining 18 were checked individually by looking at their web pages. All of them were
included in the final list of foreign banks.
Third, as the information on ownership is not available for all the banks included in the
Bankscope database, a list of banks with unknown dependence was produced. The search
matched 801 banks. This information was crossed out with a list of transnational banks
headquartered in OECD countries or the Cayman Islands, gathered from the web site
www.transnationale.org. In addition, the list of banks in the sample was intersected with the
lists of foreign banks available from the Central Banks' web pages of Hong Kong, Brazil,
Singapore, and Thailand. On a case-by-case basis, 168 additional branches of foreign banks
were also identified.
The list produced by the above criteria provides information on ownership as of end-2000 (in
some cases end-2001). In the fourth step, to obtain chronological information on changes in
ownership throughout the period, the sample of banks was intersected with a comprehensive
list of mergers and acquisitions targeting financial institutions in the sampled countries taken
from the SDC Platinum database. Specifically, the list includes all transactions announced
between January 1, 1985 and December 31, 2000, targeting institutions classified under
industrial (SIC) codes 6000, 6081, 6029, 6021, and 6712 (to be on the safe side, these codes
include a broad category of target financial institutions). The search produced 1,227
transactions involving 804 target institutions. Of those, 404 were matched with the sample of
banks. In order to track acquisitions by financial institutions exclusively, the list ignored

61

operations were the acquirers and their nationalities were unknown. Using the description of
each operation, nine categories were created, indicating the nationality of the buyer (foreign
OECD, foreign non-OECD, government, domestic resident), and the resulting ownership
position after the transaction (public, domestic, foreign OECD, and foreign non-OECD).14
With the help of this code, it was possible to replicate the evolution of bank ownership
throughout the period. In total, the algorithm identified 58 institutions changing ownership.

14

In cases where the acquirer is a public company (there are several cases involving
government-owned companies based in China), we classify the acquirer as government.
