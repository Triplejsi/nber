Outsourcing Jobs? Multinationals and US Employment

JEL No. F16,J01
ABSTRACT
Critics of globalization claim that US manufacturing firms are being driven to shift employment abroad
by the prospects of cheaper labor. Others argue that the availability of low-wage labor has allowed
US based firms to survive and even prosper. Yet evidence for either hypothesis, beyond anecdotes,
is slim. Using firm-level data collected by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), we estimate
the impact on US manufacturing employment of changes in foreign affiliate wages, controlling for
changing demand conditions and technological change. We find that the evidence supports both perspectives
on globalization. For firms most likely to perform the same tasks in foreign affiliates and at home
("horizontal" foreign investment), foreign and domestic employees appear to be substitutes. For these
firms, lower wages in affiliate locations are associated with lower employment in the US. However,
for firms which do significantly different tasks at home and abroad ("vertical" foreign investment),
foreign and domestic employment are complements. For vertical foreign investment, lower wages
abroad are associated with higher US manufacturing employment. These offsetting effects may be
combined to show that offshoring is associated with a quantitatively small decline in manufacturing
employment. Other factors, such as declining prices for consumer goods, import competition, and
falling prices for investment goods (which substitute for labor) play a more important role.

Introduction

During the last three decades, domestic manufacturing employment of US-based multinationals
has fallen steadily. 1 Between 1982 and 1999, foreign manufacturing employment of US multinationals
increased from 26 percent to nearly 40 percent of their labor force. These parallel developments have led
critics of globalization to conclude that US firms are shutting down factories at home and shifting
employment abroad in order to lower labor costs. Concerns about offshoring have intensified as newly
released data indicate a further decline in manufacturing employment both by US-based multinationals
and for the US economy as a whole.
The public outcry motivated Congress to take action. On October 22, 2004 the US Congress passed
the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The Act contains a provision to encourage profit repatriation
back to the US by domestic multinationals--explicitly for the purpose of job creation at home. Yet the
evidence linking offshore activities to falling domestic labor demand is, in fact, contradictory. Several
studies suggest that there are no employment losses from offshoring activities. The first important
research to illustrate this point is Brainard and Riker (1997), who showed that employment in low and
high income affiliates of US multinationals is complementary for manufacturing activities. Borga (2005)
and Desai, Foley, and Hines (2005) also find that expansion of US multinationals abroad stimulates job
growth at home. Reviewing these studies, Mankiw and Swagel (2006) conclude that “foreign activity
does not crowd out domestic activity; the reverse is true.”
A second set of studies (Brainard and Riker (2001), Hanson, Mataloni and Slaughter (2003),
Muendler and Becker (2006)) reaches the opposite conclusion: jobs abroad replace jobs at home, but the
effect is small. These different answers are problematic for policymakers who are left uncertain about
how to respond to the growing ranks of US firms setting up shop abroad. How can we reconcile these
two different sets of findings? We believe that the answer lies in understanding the different motivations
for foreign investment.

See Table 1, which shows a four million worker decline between 1982 and 1999.

Theoretical models of trade and foreign investment imply that different types of foreign
investments will be associated with opposite effects on domestic labor demand. Markusen and Maskus
(2001) separate multinationals into vertically- and horizontally-integrated types.

They show how

different incentives for foreign investment lead to different organizational structures, which in turn
produce different degrees of substitution between employment at home and abroad.

Horizontal

multinationals, which are defined as firms which produce the same products in different locations, are
primarily motivated by trade costs to locate abroad. 2 For these types of firms, investment abroad
substitutes for exports. One implication is that foreign affiliate employment should substitute for home
employment. For vertically-integrated firms, however, trade and foreign investment are complements.
Vertically-integrated enterprises are motivated by factor endowment differences (and consequently factor
price differences in a world where there is not factor price equalization) to locate different components of
production in different locations. As pointed out by Brainard and Riker (1997), one implication of this
kind of multinational activity is that parent and affiliate employment should be complementary.
More recent work by Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2006) draws on insights from Autor, Levy
and Murnane (2002) to develop a framework in which falling costs of offshoring can lead to wage gains
for workers at home.

Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2006) use Autor, Levy and Murnane’s

differentiation between routine and non-routine tasks to build a theoretical model of trade in tasks.
Advances in technology (such as improvements in communication) make offshoring of routine tasks less
costly, leading firms to shift production abroad. What is surprising is that offshoring of routine tasks for
vertically-integrated multinationals (there is no horizontal motive for foreign investment here) leads to
ambiguous predictions for domestic wages. The intuition behind this result is that falling costs of
offshoring act like a positive productivity shock, reducing costs of intermediate goods production.
Although the primary motivation for offshoring is to reduce labor costs, low-skill workers at home may
still gain if terms of trade effects and labor supply effects are not too large.
In this paper, we develop an empirical framework which is flexible enough to allow different
elasticities of substitution (or complementarity) between home and affiliate employment for firms that
have different motivations to engage in foreign activities. With this framework, we are able to identify
2

For the purpose of simplicity, we will occasionally refer to horizontally-integrated firms as horizontal firms, and

3

the separate effects of horizontal versus vertical foreign investment on home employment, and also allow
for different degrees of substitution (or complementarity) in high- and low-income affiliate locations. At
the same time, we control for other confounding changes, such as other factor price changes, demand
shocks, and technological change. To address the possibility that methodological differences might be
driving the conflicting results described above, we adopt a variety of different approaches to estimating
labor demand and a range of econometric techniques.
We find that the insights derived from trade theory go a long way towards explaining the apparently
contradictory evidence on the relationship between offshoring and domestic manufacturing employment.
For US parents involved in primarily horizontal activities, affiliate activity abroad substitutes for domestic
employment. For vertically-integrated parents, however, the results suggest that home and foreign
employment are complementary. Foreign wage reductions are associated with an increase in domestic
employment. The results differ across high- and low-income affiliate locations, in part because factorprice differences relative to the US are much more important in low-income regions. Nevertheless, the
negative effects for horizontal foreign investment are small: a 10 percent reduction in wages in affiliate
locations is associated with only a 0.2 percent reduction in US parent employment.
We also show that offshoring is not the primary driver of declining domestic employment of US
manufacturing multinationals between 1977 and 1999. In fact, there is some evidence that operating in
low-income affiliate locations preserves jobs, instead of destroying them.

We show that declining

domestic employment of US multinationals is primarily due to falling prices of investment goods (such as
computers, which substitute for labor), falling prices of consumption goods, and increasing import
penetration. Our research highlights both the importance of heterogeneous firm responses to opportunities
for direct investment abroad and the need to account for other avenues through which international
competition affects US labor demand.
Our results are consistent with the literature that focuses on the impact of international trade on US
jobs. Revenga (1992) finds a negative impact of changes in import prices on US employment growth.
Katz and Murphy (1992) also find that increased import competition negatively affected relative labor
demand in the US, particularly in the 1980s with the growing of the US trade deficit. Borjas, Freeman
vertically-integrated firms as vertical.

4

and Katz (1997) find that increased trade with developing countries depresses wages at the bottom of the
income distribution. Bernard, Jensen and Schott (2006) examine the impact of US imports on both the
survival and employment of US manufacturing firms. They find that imports only harm US
manufacturing employment when those imports are from low wage countries.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we describe the Bureau of
Economic Analysis data on outward direct investment and our choice of sample. Section III describes the
empirical framework and discusses econometric issues. Section IV presents the results and Section V
concludes.

II.

The BEA Data

We analyze firm-level surveys on US direct investment abroad, collected each year by the Bureau
of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the US Department of Commerce. The BEA collects confidential data on
the activities of US-based multinationals, defined as the combination of a single US entity that has made
the direct investment, called the parent, and at least one foreign business enterprise, called the foreign
affiliate. We use the data collected on majority-owned, non-bank foreign affiliates and non-bank US
parents for the benchmark years from 1982 and 1999. These benchmark years (1982, 1989, 1994 and
1999) include more comprehensive information than the annual surveys. 3
Creating a panel using the benchmark years of the BEA survey data is a nontrivial task for several
reasons. First, not all firms are required to report to the BEA and reporting requirements vary across
years. Second, we must consider the implications of the changes to the Standard Industrial Classification
(SIC) codes in 1972 and 1987 and the switch from SIC codes to the North American Industrial
Classification System (NAICS) codes in 1997. The fact that parents are allowed to consolidate
information for several affiliates in one country on a single form calls for special care in the aggregation
and interpretation of affiliate level data.
All foreign affiliates with sales, assets or net income in excess of a certain amount in absolute
value must report their data to the BEA. This amount was $3 million dollars in 1982, 1989 and 1994 and

5

rose to $7 million dollars in 1999. In addition, a new reporting requirement was imposed on parents in
1999. Parents whose sales, assets or net income exceeded $100 million (in absolute value) were required
to provide more extensive information than parents whose sales, assets or net income fell below that
level. 4 To determine whether the changes in reporting requirements biased made small firms
overrepresented in our sample in the early years, we imposed a double filter on the data using the uniform
cutoff for affiliates (based on the strictest reporting requirement of $100 million in 1999) of $5.59 million
in 1982 US dollars and $79.87 1982 US dollars for parents. As it turns out, the reporting requirements
were large enough that imposing the filter on the data makes little difference on our initial results.
Therefore, we use all of the available data.
Finally, we face selection issues with our sample of “manufacturing” firms. 5 We keep those
parents whose primary industry of sales is manufacturing since our goal is to determine whether
manufacturing jobs at home are being replaced by manufacturing jobs abroad. However, some parents
were reclassified from manufacturing to wholesale trade and services. To account for this, we keep all
parents that were ever classified in manufacturing and their manufacturing affiliates. 6
3

While the BEA collects annual data on US direct investment abroad, these data do not include all the variables we
need and can find in the benchmark years.
4
Parents who do not meet this cutoff but who have affiliates that meet the $7 million cutoff are still required to
provide extensive information for affiliates.
5
To document what has happened within industries in manufacturing over time, we created a concordance that
allows us to assign SIC codes to NAICS codes. This was necessary because in 1999 the BEA collected data on
NAICS codes and not SIC codes. We chose to convert SIC codes to NAICS codes since all future information will
be collected on the basis of NAICS codes. For example, data for the benchmark year 2004 will be available shortly
and firms report based on NAICS codes. The 1977 and 1982 benchmark years are based on the 1972 SIC codes.
The 1989 and 1994 benchmark years are based on the 1987 SIC codes. The 1999 benchmark data are based on the
1997 NAICS codes. In addition to the fact that the industry codes are not directly comparable across all benchmark
years, the BEA industry codes have been slightly modified to reflect the fact that these are enterprise data and are
called, respectively, SIC-ISI and NAICS-ISI. Working with these codes, we created a program (available upon
request) that assigns the SIC-ISI codes for the years 1977-1994 to NAICS-ISI codes. Both parents and affiliates are
classified into their primary industry of sales using the following algorithm, which tracks the algorithm used by the
BEA: the top five industries by parent or affiliate sales are used to assign to each parent or affiliate one of the 22
aggregates. Sales are collapsed into the top five industries of sales and then the maximum sale by industry is
identified. A parent or affiliate is classified as being in manufacturing if its maximum sales across the top five
industries of sales is in manufacturing.
6
There are a number of parents who have been reclassified from manufacturing to wholesale trade and
services. For example, several firms were in manufacturing but are now classified in wholesale trade because almost
all of their manufacturing is done overseas and not in the United States. To account for this, we chose our sample in
two different ways. First, we included parents who either were classified in manufacturing or had previously been
classified in manufacturing and their manufacturing affiliates. Next, we included only parents who were currently in
manufacturing in any given year and their manufacturing affiliates. Since the results are not sensitive to this
distinction, we use the larger of the two samples, keeping all parents that were ever classified in manufacturing and
their manufacturing affiliates.

6

Table 1 reports the number of employees of US manufacturing parents both in the US and in
foreign affiliate locations. US employment of manufacturing parents declined from nearly 12 million in
1982 to slightly below 8 million in 1999. The second row of Table 1 shows the employment coverage of
our sample after we perform the cleaning procedures described above. The sample size remains almost
the same, particularly in the later years.

The following two rows report the breakdown of US

employment for horizontal versus vertical multinationals (discussed in more detail below and defined in
Table 2). US employment declines are twice as large for horizontal versus vertical multinationals. While
US employment of both types of multinationals declined, foreign affiliate employment increased. Almost
all the increase in foreign affiliate employment occurred in low-income affiliate locations, and affiliate
employment gains in vertically-integrated firms were twice as large as for horizontally-integrated firms.
The fact that US employment of vertical multinationals fell by less but (low-income) affiliate employment
increased significantly more is consistent with the idea of complementarity between home and foreign
employment for vertical multinationals, as suggested by Markusen and Maskus (2001) and Grossman and
Rossi-Hansberg (2006).
The share of US multinational employment concentrated in affiliates increased from 26 percent in
1982 to 39 percent in 1999. Although total affiliate employment increased by more than one million
employees, the foreign employment gains did not fully offset the domestic losses. This suggests that
there are other important determinants of falling domestic employment for US multinationals. Alternative
explanations, which shall be incorporated into our empirical framework, include changing prices of
capital, labor-saving technical change, changing terms of trade, and increased import competition.
Manufacturing multinationals reporting to the BEA accounted for the majority of economic
activity in US manufacturing during the sample period. Appendix Table A.1 (based on Mataloni and
Fahim-Nader (1996) and Mataloni and Yorgason (2006)) reports the coverage of the BEA data for
benchmark years 1982 through 1999. In 1982, gross product by these enterprises accounted for over 80
percent of total manufacturing and 77 percent of manufactured exports in the United States. By 1999, the
BEA’s coverage had declined slightly: these enterprises accounted for only 63 percent of US exports and
about half of manufacturing employment. These firms also accounted for more than 80 percent of total
private US research and development expenditures throughout the sample period (Mataloni and Fahim-

7

Nader (1996)). Appendix Table A.1 also shows that the proportion of services firms accounted for by the
BEA sample is extremely small. During the sample period, the BEA sample accounted for only between
6 and 8 percent of total gross product in services.

Consequently, we restrict our analysis to

manufacturing, which we believe provides a more representative sample.
How reliable are these data? These are the only data officially collected by a US government
agency on affiliate activity abroad. We have initiated a number of data checks to analyze the reliability of
the coverage. 7, 8 We were able to cross-check the employment numbers for US affiliate activity reported
by the BEA with data on inward foreign investment reported by the official statistical agencies in
Germany and Sweden. These checks are reported in Appendix Table A.2. We report total employment in
both countries as indicated by the BEA database and show that it is quite close to the same numbers
collected by the national statistical agencies. Although there are some discrepancies between BEA and
German and Swedish data, this may be, at least partially, accounted for by variation in reporting based
upon fiscal year vs. calendar year. The BEA classifies a firm in 1999 if its fiscal year ends in 1999—this
could be for any month in 1999. Although most firms have their fiscal year ending in December, enough
have earlier end dates that some of the 1999 BEA employment figures correspond to a mix of the 1998
and 1999 employment figures reported by the statistical bureaus for Sweden and Germany.

III.

Empirical Framework

Previous work has used very different econometric models to specify the impact of foreign
affiliate activity on labor demand at home, making it difficult to identify whether the conflicting results
stem from different approaches or different datasets and time periods. Brainard and Riker (1997) estimate
labor demand as a function of wages in different locations, Desai, et al. (2006) estimate a reduced form
7

We are particularly grateful to Marc Muendler and Karolina Eckholm for helping us do this cross-checking. They
provided the data on the activities of US multinational affiliates in Germany and Sweden.
8
We also contacted Statistics Canada to check whether they record information on affiliates of US multinationals in
Canada, which would allow us to cross-check US data on foreign affiliates there with Canadian data on inward

8

equation with log labor at home as a function of log labor abroad, and Brainard and Riker (2001),
Hanson, Mataloni and Slaughter (2003) and Muendler and Becker (2006) use a translog cost function
approach to derive factor shares as a function of wages in different locations. Katz and Murphy (1992)
and Card (2001), focusing on the effects of immigration and trade, both use a CES functional form to
derive an equilibrium relationship between the ratio of employment at home to employment abroad and
the ratio of wages at home to wages abroad.
We chose as our primary specification to derive labor demand from a generalized cost function.
Our preferred approach is attractive for several reasons. It puts minimal restrictions on the nature of the
production function, unlike the CES specification which imposes a constant elasticity of substitution
across different factor inputs.

In the translog approach, we worry that identifying elasticities of

substitution or complementarity and calculating standard errors is a less transparent process (depending,
among other things, on the choice of factor shares) than estimating a labor demand equation. Previous
approaches in the offshoring literature have imposed a short-run cost function and kept capital inputs
fixed, which would make it difficult for us to compare our results to earlier coefficient estimates.
However, for completeness we also derive estimating equations using a generalized translog and CES
function approach. We shall see that the implied elasticities of complementarity (or substitution) are
remarkably robust across these different specifications.
Modifying Hamermesh (1993), let us consider a firm using N domestic factors and N* foreign
factors of production X1…XN , X1*…XN* . We begin by assuming there are only two locations (domestic
and foreign) but will generalize to j locations in the empirical specification which follows. Let the
production function for a US multinational firm i producing total aggregate worldwide output Yi and using
N domestic and N* foreign inputs Xi and Xi* be

(1) Yi = f ( X 1i ,...., X Ni X 1i* ,...., X Ni* ), fi > 0, fii < 0
Output Y can include production at home and abroad and production could be exported or sold on
domestic markets. Then the associated cost function, based on the demands for X1 through XN and X1*
through XN* is given by
foreign investment. Statistics Canada informed us that they do not gather data on affiliates because it is too difficult
to define a foreign affiliate and referred us to the BEA.

9

(2) Ci = g ( w1i ,...., wNi , w1i* ,...., wNi* , Yi ), gi > 0
where the wi’s and wi*’s are the N and N* input prices at home and in the foreign affiliate location. One
can use Shepard’s lemma to derive the factor demand for the nth input for US multinational firm i:

(3) X ni = X nid ( w1i ,...., wNi , w1i* ,...., wNi* , Yi ), n = 1,..., N , n* = 1,..., N *

Our first approach will be to estimate a log-linear version of equation (3), focusing on US labor demand
and extending (3) to allow for three locations. With three locations, there are three types of labor inputs:
home labor, foreign labor in low-income affiliates, and foreign labor in high-income affiliates. This
framework is flexible enough to allow for a range of production technologies, including Brainard and
Riker’s (1997) assumption that production is vertically decomposed across high-wage and low-wage
regions. We will also allow for two other types of inputs, making the total number of inputs N in each
location equal to three: labor, physical capital, and research and development inputs. As with wages, we
allow physical capital and research and development inputs to be separately identified depending on
location.
One estimation issue which arises is that global output Y for firm i is jointly determined with
domestic US employment. If we were to estimate (3) directly, we would have a significant simultaneity
problem. We solve this by assuming that aggregate worldwide output Y for firm i is a function of
domestic and foreign prices:

Yi = Y ( P, P*)

Substituting this into (3) yields:

(4) X ni = X nid ( w1i ,...., wNi , w1i* ,...., wNi* , P, P*), n = 1,..., N , n* = 1,..., N * .

10

Our first set of estimating equations is based on log-linearization of (4), generalizing to j
locations, and takes the following form:

(5) ln Liht = β 0 + ∑ α j ln Pjt + ∑η j wijt + ∑ ω j rijt + ∑ χ j tijt + dt + f i + ε ijt .
j

The dependent variable lnL is the natural logarithm of net annual employment by the US parent in the
United States, the P’s are final goods prices, w is the wage in location j and time t, r is the price of capital
in location j and time t, and t is the price of research and development goods. We allow for time effects d
and a firm-specific (common to the parent and its affiliate) fixed effect fi, which takes into account both
firm-specific productivity differences and other non-varying firm characteristics, while j indexes location
and t indexes time.

Defining Horizontal and Vertical Multinationals

Markusen and Maskus (2001), in their comprehensive survey of general equilibrium approaches
to the multinational firm, define horizontal multinationals as “firms that produce the same product in
multiple plants, serving local markets by local production.” This definition of horizontal integration
implies that intra-firm trade will be low, since foreign investment substitutes for US exports. Vertical
firms are defined as “firms that fragment the production process into stages based on factor intensities and
locate activities according to international differences in factor prices.” An important finding of
Markusen and Maskus is that foreign investment replaces trade in the case of horizontal multinationals
but is positively correlated with trade in the case of vertical foreign investment. Although we cannot
directly test the motivation for foreign investment with our data, we can use the different implications for
intra-firm trade as a way to distinguish vertical from horizontal foreign investment.
We construct intra-firm trade as the sum of exports to foreign affiliates for further processing plus
imports from foreign affiliates as a share of sales. We then define firms as vertical if they have a high
share of intra-firm trade and firms as horizontal if they have a low share. Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg
(2006) also use intra-firm trade to quantify the increase in vertical activities of multinationals, pointing
out that intra-firm trade “mostly reflects the international division of labor within multinational

11

enterprises.” We measure high intra-firm trade in two ways. First we run a regression of intra-firm trade
on industry dummies, and define firms as vertical if the industry dummy is statistically significant. As
reported in Table 2, this is equivalent to selecting those industries with a high average share of intra-firm
trade during the sample period as vertical multinationals.
The results in Table 2 suggest that the following industries may be characterized as vertical:
chemicals, plastics, primary and fabricated metals, machinery, computers and electronics, electrical
equipment, and transportation equipment. The remaining industries are classified as horizontal: textiles
and apparel, food, beverages and tobacco, leather products, wood and paper products, petroleum products,
non-metallic metals and furniture. While it may be surprising that apparel is classified as horizontal and
not vertical, potential vertical activity in that sector is limited by high trade costs. Much horizontal FDI is
motivated by trade barriers (such as tariffs or quotas). Textiles and apparel and beverages and tobacco are
typically the most protected sectors in both industrial and developing countries (for developing countries,
see Hanson and Harrison (2001)). To make this point more clearly, we have also listed in the last three
columns a summary measure of tariffs for China, an average for all developing countries, and tariffs in
the United States. The average tariffs by sector for developing countries and China is for 1999 and is
taken from the World Bank’s trade database. The measure of tariffs for the US includes tariffs and
transport costs for each sector for the US in 1979, based on Bernard, Jensen, and Schott (2006). For the
United States, we selected an earlier year to indicate more clearly the differences in the pattern of
protection across sectors; in more recent years, tariffs in the United States have been reduced to very low
levels. Trade frictions are highest for textiles and apparel, beverages and tobacco, leather, and nonmetallic minerals (cement). This implies that firms in highly protected sectors (textiles and apparel) or in
sectors with high costs of transportation (cement) must frequently engage in horizontal investments in
order to access domestic foreign markets.
It is also instructive to compare our classification of horizontal versus vertical with the
classification used by Autor, Levy, and Murnane (2003) to categorize workers into routine and nonroutine tasks. They argue that computers are likely to substitute for labor in the case of routine tasks,
which could be either cognitive or manual, and most likely to be complementary with labor in the case of
cognitive non-routine tasks. As pointed out by Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2006), “routine” tasks are

12

more likely to be offshored via vertical foreign investment (there is no motivation for horizontal foreign
investment in their framework). We posit that the type of routine tasks that are important in
manufacturing are manual rather than cognitive. We pick a measure of non-routine manual tasks which
measures eye-hand-foot coordination (EFT). It is possible to use the Autor, et al. data to classify
industries according to their EFT level, by merging CPS worker and occupation data with their industry
affiliation. In Table 2, firms defined as vertically-integrated on the basis of high intra-firm trade measure
poorly in the EFT scale. So our measure of vertical versus horizontal could also be interpreted as a
measure of distance from non-routine manual tasks.

Data and Estimation Issues
To estimate equation (5) we need data on US employment, capital prices, wages, final goods
prices, and research and development prices. We need factor prices and output prices for each of the j
locations in which the multinational firm has operations. We measure US employment as the (log)
number of individuals employed by the parent in the US, since hours or even employment broken down
by skill levels are not collected for US parents. Domestic prices of investment are defined at the
disaggregated industry level and are taken from the NBER’s manufacturing database. Domestic US
wages are also taken from the NBER’s manufacturing database, and are available at the disaggregated
industry level.
While in principle there could be as many factor and final goods prices as there are countries in
the BEA database, in practice the number of j locations is limited by data availability and the need for
parsimony in estimation. We restrict our j locations to 3: domestic (US) activity, high income locations,
and low-income locations. One problem is that many firms, especially small enterprises, do not have any
operations in low-income countries. To permit us to include these firms in the estimation, we set wages
for these firms equal to zero and add a dummy variable indicating whether or not the firm has a missing
observation for low-income affiliates.
For foreign prices P* we use the prices of consumption goods, taken from the Penn World
Tables. We also rely on the Penn World Table measures of foreign investment prices to capture the
impact of the price of foreign capital. While in principle all foreign factor prices should be broken down

13

into low-income foreign and high-income foreign affiliate locations, collinearity in investment and
consumption prices have led us to aggregate these prices across foreign affiliate locations. Because both
capital and goods are significantly more mobile than individuals, the factor price differentials across high
and low-income affiliate locations are much larger for labor inputs.
In US manufacturing, international competition plays an important role in price determination, so
we proxy for US industry-level prices using both industry dummies and import competition. These data
were made available at the 4-digit ISIC level by Bernard, Jensen, and Schott (2006). We also include a
measure of import penetration from low-wage countries, also computed by these authors. Alternative
specifications reported later in the paper use industry-level aggregates of output as alternative measures of
output shocks, with separate industry-level measures of Y calculated for parents and affiliates.
We do not have adequate measures of prices for research and development goods. However, we
believe that these are important inputs into production and could account for a significant impact on
manufacturing employment, particularly if research and development inputs are associated with laborsaving technical change. Consequently, we proxy for prices of research and development goods with the
share of research and development employment in total employment at the firm level. These are
separately available for both the parent and affiliates in each location.
Since wages are calculated at the country level using BEA aggregates of the firm-level measures,
we assume that wages are exogenously determined. However, we also test for the validity of this
assumption by using wages collected by UNIDO. Our wage measure is defined using the following
formula:

wijt = ∑ Wct
c∈ j

Lic ,to

∑

c

Lic ,to

where w is the wage facing the ith firm at time t in country c in affiliate location j, and the Wct’s
are country-time specific wages either computed using the BEA data on worker compensation aggregated
to the country level or the UNIDO wages. Wages are employment-weighted averages of wages in highand low-income affiliates, where the weights are given by the parent’s initial share of employment within
countries belonging to each high- and low-income category. We use initial period employment weights to

14

avoid endogeneity problems. Affiliate country locations are defined as either high- or low-income based
on the World Bank’s country classifications (see Table 3).

Results

We report sample means in Table 4. The US employment share in worldwide parent activity
averaged 83.4 percent for horizontally-integrated and 80.7 percent for vertically-integrated firms. Affiliate
labor expenditure shares accounted for between 14 and 17.2 percent of expenditures, while low-income
affiliate shares only accounted for the remaining two percent. During this period, the US parent share of
worldwide labor expenses fell 4 percent, with most of the 4 percent drop in US parent shares going to
low-income affiliate locations.
US parent employment shares fell considerably more than expenditure shares, falling from 74 to
61 percent of worldwide parent employment (see Table 1). The reason why the employment changes
were large but expenditure share changes were small is because wage trends offset the employment
developments: real wages in the sample went up in the United States but fell in high-income and lowincome affiliate countries. The real wage declines abroad were large, particularly in low-income
locations. One explanation which is consistent with these wage trends is a change in the composition of
employment: US parents (and their high-income affiliates) are retaining relatively high-skilled workers
and shifting relatively low-skilled jobs to low-income countries where labor is less expensive. This was
particularly true among vertical multinationals, where domestic wages increased by nearly 20 percent in
real terms over the sample period and low-income affiliate real wages fell by 27 percent.
Research and development employment as a share of total parent employment averaged 3.1
percent for horizontal and 9.1 percent for vertically-integrated US multinationals. The significantly
higher R&D shares and much larger domestic (US) wage increases for vertical multinationals is
consistent with the hypothesis that these types of firms divide their activities between foreign and
domestic locations, performing the most skill-intensive activities at home. R&D employment as a share
of total employment rose in the US but fell in both high- and low-skill affiliate locations, suggesting that
US parents chose to increasingly concentrate R&D activity in the United States.

15

Average import penetration in the four-digit SIC sector over the period was 12.7 percent for
horizontal firms and 17.8 percent for vertical firms. Import penetration increased by 8.2 percentage
points for horizontal firms and 14.6 percentage points for vertical firms, which reflects an enormous
increase in the exposure of US manufacturing firms to import competition. Import competition from lowwage countries also increased for both types of enterprises, increasing by 9.9 for horizontal firms and 6.2
percentage points for vertical firms. While the price of investment goods in the US fell for both sets of
enterprises, prices fell faster for vertically-integrated firms, reflecting, in part, the importance of falling
computer-related costs for these firms. The real price of consumption goods, as reported by the Penn
World Tables, also fell for both sets of enterprises reflecting not just changes in demand but also advances
in productivity and increased competition from lower wage countries.

Fixed Effect Results for Labor Demand
We report the results of estimating equation (5) in Table 5. The log of US employment is our
dependent variable and we use a within transformation of the data to eliminate firm fixed effects. All
specifications include time dummies to control for year-specific shocks. The first column of Table 5
reports coefficient estimates when we pool horizontal and vertical enterprises. The results suggest that
employees in low-income affiliates are substitutes for parent home employment and employees in highincome affiliates are complements. The point estimate of 0.017 on low-income affiliate wages indicates
that a 10 percent fall in foreign wages would lead to a 0.17 percent fall in US parent employment. The
point estimate on high-income affiliate wages suggests the opposite: that a 10 percent increase in highincome affiliate wage increases would be associated with a 0.31 percent fall in parent employment. In
columns (2) and (3), we allow the slope coefficients of our explanatory variables to vary according to
whether firms are vertically or horizontally integrated. Formal F-tests of equality of coefficients are
presented in column (4); in most cases, we reject that the coefficients are the same across the two types of
enterprises. Consequently, we separately report results for vertically and horizontally integrated parents
throughout the remainder of the paper.
Column (2) reports the results for vertically-integrated multinational enterprises.

The coefficient

on low-income affiliate wages, at -0.032, suggests that a 10 percent fall in affiliate wage levels would lead

16

to a 0.32 percent increase in domestic (US) labor demand. For these types of firms, employment in lowincome affiliates is complementary with home employment. The coefficient on high-income wages, while
also negative, is smaller in magnitude and statistically insignificant. These results suggest that falling
wages abroad should boost US manufacturing employment for vertically-integrated firms, consistent with
the predictions in Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2006). Their model suggests that for vertical
multinationals, lower wages abroad could act as cost savings that translate into higher employment at
home.
The results are different for horizontal foreign investment, as reported in column (3) of Table 5.
The coefficient on both high- and low-income affiliate wages is now positive and statistically significant.
The coefficient on low-income affiliate wages, at 0.027, suggests that a 10 percent fall in affiliate wages
would be associated with a 0.27 percentage point fall in parent employment. The coefficient on highincome affiliate wages is also positive and statistically significant. These results suggest that affiliate
employment in horizontally-integrated multinationals substitutes for parent employment. However, the
magnitudes are very small: even an implausibly large decline of 50 percent in foreign affiliate wages
would result in only a 1.5 percent fall in parent employment.
The own-wage elasticity, which varies between -0.34 and -0.52, suggests that a one percent
increase in the domestic US manufacturing wage reduces labor demand by 0.34 to 0.52 percent. The
magnitude is in line with the dozens of studies cited in Hamermesh (1993), who reports that most studies
find that the own-wage elasticity for labor lies between 0.3 and 0.7. The coefficient on the industryspecific home price of investment is positive for both types of enterprises, suggesting that reductions in
the price of domestic investment goods reduce domestic labor demand. The coefficient on investment
abroad has the opposite sign, suggesting that reductions in the cost of investment abroad are associated
with increased labor demand at home. The coefficient estimates on the domestic price of investment
goods imply that in the US, investment and labor are generally substitutes. This is consistent with a story
in which less skilled workers are being replaced by capital (computers) and consistent with previous labor
demand studies on capital-labor substitution cited in Hamermesh (1993).
Increases in import penetration (arms-length trade) and foreign demand shocks also affect
domestic labor demand. A 10 percentage point increase in import penetration during the sample period

17

would imply a decline in US manufacturing employment of 3.5 percentage points for vertical firms. For
horizontal enterprises, import penetration from low-wage countries significantly and negatively affected
labor demand. The point estimates imply that a 10 percentage point increase in import penetration from
low-wage countries was associated with a 6.1 percentage point fall in labor demand. The different effects
for horizontal and vertical firms across different types of import competition reflect the fact that there was
significantly more import competition from low wage countries in the industries which we characterize is
horizontal, including textiles and apparel, leather products, pulp and paper, and woods products. A one
percent increase in the prices of consumption goods in affiliate locations is associated with a 0.58
percentage point increase in employment for vertical multinationals and a 1.15 increase for horizontal
multinationals.
Big negative employment effects are also associated with our domestic proxy for the prices of
technology inputs, the share of research and development employment in total parent employment. The
results indicate that a ten percentage point increase in the parent research and development employment
shares would be associated with a 3.5 percentage point decline for vertical firms and 9.1 percentage point
decline for horizontal firms. For horizontally-integrated firms, parent research and development
employment as a share of total employment increased by 4.3 percentage points between 1977 and 1999,
implying a reduction in home employment of 4 percent. However, the coefficients on affiliate R&D
employment are either insignificant or positive, suggesting that R&D activities in affiliates are associated
with positive employment gains for the US parent.
The critical parameters of interest in Table 5 are the coefficients on affiliate wages, which
indicate whether affiliate employment substitutes for or is complementary to home employment. In Table
6, we explore whether our results are robust to the definition of affiliate wages. Instead of constructing
country-level wages from the BEA sample, we use country wages reported by UNIDO. Wages are
calculated based on surveys administered by UNIDO, supplemented with secondary sources (such as
national statistical agencies) gathered by UNIDO as well. Wages are calculated as compensation divided
by number of employees, collected at the 3 digit ISIC level (Revision 2). All values are converted to US
dollars using the IMF exchange rate series rf. As in Table 5, we weight country-level wages using the
parent’s initial distribution of employment across affiliate locations when the parent first appears in the

18

sample. The results in Table 6 are consistent with our earlier results, suggesting that the source for
country-level wages does not affect our coefficient estimates. The coefficients on high- and low-income
affiliate wages are the same sign and close in magnitude to the previous results. As before, the results
indicate that home and foreign employment are complements for vertical multinationals but that home
and foreign employment are substitutes for horizontal multinationals.

Alternative Specifications
We face potentially important selection problems. Between each benchmark year, roughly 20% of
the parents drop out of our sample and do not reappear. If some of these firms relocate all operations
abroad and close down their US operations, then our estimates of the employment costs of multinational
activity could be downward biased. Following Wooldridge (2002, p. 581), we test for survivorship bias
by including a lead of the selection indicator, si, t+1, in our estimating equations, where si,t+1 is equal to zero
for firms that do not exit the sample and switches from zero to one in the period just before attrition. The
results of this test are reported in the third to last row of columns one and three of Appendix Table A5.
The coefficient on the lead of the selection indicator is negative and significant for both vertically- and
horizontally-integrated firms. The significant and negative sign on the selection variable is a possible
indicator that firms which relocate abroad are those most likely to contract employment. To address this
potential criticism, we correct for selection bias below.
To obtain consistent estimates of our parameters, we use the inverse probability weighting
scheme outlined in Wooldridge (2002) which consists of the following two-step procedure. In each time
period, we estimate a binary response model for the probability of survival for the group in the sample at
time t-1. Using the fitted probabilities from the first step, we obtain the following weights:
∧

∧

∧

∧

p it = π it * π i ,t −1 * ...π I ,1 .
where hats denote fitted probabilities. This methodology allows us to choose covariates in the probits that
are essentially everything we can observe for units in the sample at time t-1 that might affect attrition. In
our case, we include all of the regressors in our original model plus firm size, firm profitability and the
firm’s share of employment in low-income countries.

19

Columns (2) and (4) of Appendix Table 5 report the estimated coefficients and standard errors
obtained using the weighting procedure described above. In columns (1) and (3) we report the unweighted
estimates for purposes of comparison. In general, the point estimates in the weighted regressions are
larger for home prices and smaller for foreign prices: the implication is that small firms are more sensitive
to domestic price movements and less sensitive to foreign price movements than large firms. However, in
most cases the point estimates are not very different from those in Tables 5 and 6.
One serious drawback to using the weighted estimates is that the weighting scheme gives an
inordinate amount of importance to the small firms in our sample. The correction is problematic for the
following reason: if we define “small” as a firm for which the size of the capital stock is less than the
mean of the capital stock of all firms, then the “small” firms in our sample account for only 23.8% of
employment while the large firms account for the remainder. Since small firms are much more likely to
drop out of our sample, our weighting scheme assigns larger weights to firms with a relatively small share
of total employment. From this standpoint, it might make sense to weight firms by firm size rather than
the inverse of firm size. The problem is that we would still be left with inconsistent estimates. For all of
these reasons, we prefer to use as our baseline the unweighted estimates reported in the previous tables.
We also test for the robustness of our results to two alternatives: a framework based on a translog
cost function and a framework based on CES production functions. The translog approach has been
adopted by Brainard and Riker (2001), Hanson, Mataloni and Slaughter (2003) and Muendler and Becker
(2006). This alternative approach has the advantage that the translog cost function approximates many
well behaved cost functions. The translog total variable cost (TC) function (omitting time and parent
subscripts) for wages W, investment prices r, research and development input prices t and output Y is
given by:

20

Differentiating ln TC with respect to ln Wj according to Shepard’s lemma, and allowing for a firm fixed

where LSHARE is defined as the cost share of labor expenditures in location j for parent i in time t,
relative to expenditures on labor and capital across all locations.
We report coefficient estimates for equation (6), substituting our price measures for output Y to
avoid endogeneity concerns, and the implied Allen elasticities of substitution from the translog cost share
approach, in Appendix Table A.6. The coefficients on affiliate wages imply that foreign labor in
horizontal multinationals substitutes for home labor in both high- and low-income affiliate locations. The
magnitudes for high-income affiliates are consistent with our first two approaches: in both vertical and
horizontal firms, workers in high-income locations are substitutes for domestic employees. In lowincome affiliates, however, employment is complementary with US employment. As expected, the ownprice elasticity is negative.
For completeness, we also consider aggregating capital and labor across locations using a CES
function (Katz and Murphy (1992) and Card (2001) use this approach). Thus we define L as follows:
σ

⎡

Equations (14a) and (14b) underscore the fact that as long as there is some substitution (or
complementarity) between domestic and foreign labor, the cost of labor abroad plays an important role in
determining the demand for US labor. In addition, one of the restrictions of the CES specification is that
the Allen elasticity of substitution between parent and low-income affiliates should be the same as the
elasticity of substitution between parent and high-income affiliates.
The estimates are reported in Appendix Table A7. The implied Allen elasticity of substitution,
which is the negative of the reported coefficient estimate on wages, is positive for horizontally-integrated
multinationals. For horizontal firms, a one percentage point increase in the ratio of US to foreign affiliate
wages would lead to a decline in US employment of between 0.16 and 0.19 percentage points. The CES
approach corroborates the results in Tables 5 and 6 showing that affiliate labor in horizontal
multinationals substitutes for parent employment. For vertical multinationals, labor in low-income
affiliates is complementary with US parent employment but labor in high-income affiliates substitutes for
US parent employment.

Comparing Elasticities of Labor Demand Across Specifications
All three approaches yield coefficient estimates which can be used to derive elasticities of factor
demand η and Allen elasticities of substitution σ . In equation (5), the key parameters are the elasticities
of factor demand η . Typically, inputs i and j are referred to as p-complements if ηij is less than zero,
and p-substitutes if ηij is greater than zero. The key parameters in equation (6) are the ξ j ’s. To convert

23

these into Allen partial elasticities of substitution between locations, we can calculate the following based
on observed labor shares sj :

(15) σ jk = (ξ jk + s j sk ) / s j sk
σ jj = (ξ jj + s j s j − s j ) / s j s j
The Allen partial elasticity of substitution σ jk gives us the percentage change in the ratio of Lj to Lk with
respect to the percentage change in the ratio of wk to wj. The Allen partial elasticity of substitution is
directly estimated as the coefficient on relative wages using the CES approach (equations (14a) and
(14b)). To convert the Allen partial elasticity of substitution into an elasticity of factor demand, we
multiply by the factor share:

(16) ηij = s j σij = ∂ ln Li / ∂ ln w j

We report both Allen and factor price elasticities of substitution for each of the three estimation
strategies in Table 7. Factor shares are typically computed by taking the sample means of the data. 10
Recall that a negative elasticityηij implies that an increase in foreign wages reduces the demand for US
labor, while a positive sign indicates that US and foreign labor are price substitutes. The different
approaches suggest that home and affiliate employment are substitutes for horizontal multinationals but
complements for vertically-integrated firms. The price elasticity of demand ηij is positive and significant
for horizontal multinationals across all specifications, consistent with substitution between home and
foreign affiliate employment. The price elasticity appears to be between 0.02 and 0.03 in low-income
affiliates and averages around 0.10 for high-income affiliates. In high-income affiliate locations, a 1
percentage point increase in affiliate employment is associated with a 0.1 percentage point decline in US
employment. The point estimates for horizontal multinationals are similar to those derived by Muendler,
et al. (2006) and Brainard and Riker (2001) for low-income locations but higher in high-income affiliates.
For vertical multinationals, the point estimates are consistently negative in low-income locations but not
10

Confidence intervals could be computed using bootstrapped standard errors.

24

precisely estimated for high-income locations. The results imply that low-income employment is
complementary with domestic employment in vertical multinationals, but again the magnitudes are not
large: a 10 percentage point decline in foreign wages would be associated with a .3 percentage point
increase in US employment.
We summarize the effects of factor price changes, trade, and technical change on US
manufacturing employment in Table 8. We combine the coefficient estimates presented in Table 5 with
the actual mean changes in wages, investment prices, trade, research and development employment, and
goods prices taken from Table 3. We see that the major determinants of contraction in US manufacturing
parent employment are (1) falling real prices of consumption goods (2), falling prices of investment goods
(which incorporates the falling prices of computers), which makes it cheaper to substitute capital for
labor, and (3) increasing import competition. While the increase in home wages relative to affiliate wages
has played a role for both vertical and horizontal multinationals, that effect is quantitatively small. For
horizontal foreign investment, the combined effects of higher domestic wages and falling foreign wages
only account for a 4.5 percent decline in US employment. In comparison, falling consumption prices
account for an 11 percent decline, falling investment prices at home account for a 9 percent decline, and
increasing import competition from low-wage countries accounts for a 6 percent decline in home
employment.

For vertical multinationals, falling prices in low-income countries boosted employment by

a small percentage, but falling domestic investment prices and import competition again played a much
more important role. These figures suggest that high US labor costs are not the primary force behind the
significant reduction in US employment of American multinational firms.
We have not allowed for the possibility that hiring workers abroad prevents a parent from
shutting down operations. Borjas, Freeman and Katz (1997) study this counterfactual by asking what
would have happened to low wage workers if imports from developing countries had been produced by
US firms. In a similar spirit, we would like to know what might have happened to US workers if the
parent had not hired workers in developing countries. Our dummy for employment in developing
countries suggests that low-income affiliate activities have, in fact, preserved some jobs. Table 8 shows
that firms which expanded operations in low-income affiliate locations on average increased parent
employment by 2 (for horizontal) to 3 (for vertical) percentage points. On the other hand, the gains from

25

operating in low-income countries were not sufficient to offset the negative effects on domestic parent
employment of falling investment prices, falling consumer prices abroad, and increasing import
competition.

VI. Concluding Comments
This paper measures the impact of different forms of globalization on manufacturing employment
by US multinationals in the United States. Over the period 1982 to 1999 manufacturing employment of
US multinationals contracted by 4 million jobs, possibly foreshadowing the overall reduction in US
manufacturing employment that accelerated from 1999 onwards. During this period, the number of
workers hired by affiliates in developing countries increased while wages paid to these workers declined.
these facts are consistent with the hypothesis that US parents are exporting low-wage jobs to low-income
countries. In this paper, we show that this hypothesis is only partially supported by the evidence.
The expansion of manufacturing employment in developing countries amounts to only one-quarter
of the jobs lost at home. Our research shows that other factors—including technological change, and
international trade—are much more important determinants of US manufacturing employment. Moreover,
the results also suggest that job losses would have probably been even greater in the absence of expanded
offshoring by US multinationals.
Using data on US based multinationals from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), we
estimate the impact on US manufacturing employment of changes in foreign affiliate wages, controlling
for changing demand conditions, import competition and technological change. We find that the evidence
on the links between offshoring and domestic employment is mixed, and that the effect depends on both
the type and the location of foreign investment. We conclude that the heterogeneity in effects is one
reason why previous research on this topic has yielded such apparently contradictory results. For firms
most likely to perform the same tasks in foreign affiliates and at home (“horizontal” foreign investment),
foreign and domestic employees appear to be substitutes. For these firms, lower wages in affiliate
locations are associated with lower employment in the US. However, for firms which do significantly
different tasks at home and abroad (“vertical” foreign investment), foreign and domestic employment are
complements. The complementarity between domestic and foreign activities for vertically-integrated

26

firms is consistent with theoretical models developed by Grossman, Markusen, Maskus, and RossiHansberg. For vertical foreign investment, lower wages abroad are associated with higher US
manufacturing employment.
However, even for horizontal multinationals, the negative impact of offshoring on US labor
demand is small. For horizontal foreign investment, the combined effects of higher domestic wages and
falling foreign wages only accounts for a 4 percent decline in US employment. In comparison, falling
consumption prices account for an 11 percent decline, falling investment prices which have allowed firms
to replace workers with computers or machines account for a 9 percent decline, and increasing import
competition from low-wage countries accounts for a 6 percent decline in home employment.

For

vertical multinationals, the gains from operating in low-income countries were not sufficient to offset the
negative effects on domestic parent employment of falling investment prices, falling consumer prices
abroad, and increasing import competition.

For a detailed description of which industries are included in miscellaneous see:
http://www.census.gov/epcd/naics/NAICS33C.HTM#N339. Intrafirm trade is defined as the sum of exports to
foreign affiliates for further processing plus imports from foreign affiliates, divided by sales.
EHF is a measure of eye-hand-foot coordination required to perform manual tasks. The higher the value, the less
“routine” the tasks performed by manual labor.

Notes: Coefficients taken from Tables 5 and 6 and Appendix Tables A.6 and A.7 in the text. Factor shares used to compute elasticities taken from sample means
(see Table 4). See equations (15) and (16) for formulas to convert elasticities of labor demand into Allen elasticities of substitution and vice versa. The Allen
partial elasticity of substitution σjk gives us the percentage change in the ratio of Lj to Lk with respect to the percentage change in the ratio of wk to wj.

DESCRIPTION OF VARIABLES AND DATA SOURCES

Variable Name
Log Wage (Industry level)

Source
US Bureau of
Economic Analysis

Description
Wages and salaries of employees and employer expenditures for all
employee benefit plans in parents computed separately for parents,
high-income affiliates and other affiliates and averaged across
industries.

Log Wage (Industry level)

UNIDO

Wages calculated based on surveys administered by UNIDO,
supplemented with secondary sources (such as national statistical
agencies). Wages calculated as compensation divided by number
of employees at the 3 digit ISIC level Revision 2. All values
converted to US dollars using the IMF exchange rate series rf. Data
taken from INDSTAT3, published in 2006 by UNIDO.

Log Employment

US Bureau of
Economic Analysis

Log of the number of full-time and part-time employees on the
payroll at the end of the fiscal year in all affiliates. However, a
count taken during the year was accepted if it was a reasonable
proxy for the end-of-year number. Computed separately for parents,
high-income affiliates and other affiliates.

R&D Share
R&D Share (High-income Affiliates)
R&D Share (Low-income Affiliates)
US Investment Price

US Bureau of
Economic Analysis

Number of employees in research and development as a percentage
of total employment. Computed separately for US parents, affiliates
in high-income locations and affiliates in low-income locations.
This is the variable PIINV in the NBER’s manufacturing
productivity database. It is set to 1 in 1987. It combines separate
deflators for structures and equipment, based on the distribution of
each type of asset in the industry. This is a deflator for new
investment flows, not the existing capital stock. See
www.nber.org.
PPP price of domestic investment calculated from the PWT 6.1.
See Appendix for PWT 6.1 for more details, or
http://pwt.econ.upenn.edu.
PPP price of consumption goods calculated from the PWT 6.1. See
Appendix for PWT 6.1 for more details, or
http://pwt.econ.upenn.edu.
Imports into the US divided by imports into the US plus total
production in the US less exports from the US by year by 4-digit
SIC 1987 revision code industrial classification.
