The Forecasting Ability of Money Market Fund
Managers and Its Economic Value

ABSTRACT

The model proposed by Merton(1981) to determine the
value of' forecasting ability is adapted to investigate
whether money market fund managers successfully anticipate
changes in the yield curve by adjusting the average maturity
of their portfolios in the right direction. The potential
economic value of' such behavior is assessed, and it is shown
that if the portfolios of all money market funds were
aggregated it would appear that managers are good forecasters
even if individually they possess insignificant forecasting
ability. At the same time, the economic value of' the aggregate
portfolio will be diminished because of the reduced net change
in average maturity. Thus, diversifying into many money market
funds will not attain the gain that could be realized if' an
individual manager had a forecasting ability equal to the
quality of the average forecast.
A sample of 34 money market funds is investigated. Analysis
suggests that a small fraction of the funds exhibited forecasting
skills, but even theygenerated negligible economic value because
the changes in their portfolios average maturity were too small.
There appears to be no relationship between forecasting ability
and economic success of money market funds as measured by asset
size and growth.

THE FORECASTING ABILITY OF MONEY MARKET FUND MANAGERS
AND ITS ECONOMIC VALUE

I. INTRODUCTION
The performance of investment managers encompasses two elements: (1)
Microforecasting: the ability to forecast price movements of individual

stocks and (2) Macroforecasting:

the ability to forecast the performance of

equities relative to fixed income securities.

Merton (1981) motivates the study of macroforecasting by demonstrating the
staggering value of macroforecasting ability; using monthly returns of
Treasury—bills and a portfolio invested in the NYSE for the period 1927—1978

he demonstrates that a manager who started with 1OOO in January 1927 and
switched funds between these two assets every month with perfect foresight,
would have produced by December 1978 a fund valued at approximately

5,4OO,OOO,OOO compared with approximately 67,OOO when consistently invested
in the NYSE index. Such numbers explain the zeal of practitioners in
attemptiong to tap this potential reward and attempts by students of finance
to identify above—average macroforecasting talents.

Studies of macroforecasting prior to Merton's (1981) work1 used the
capital asset pricing model (CAPM) to identify the element of macroforecasting

in the overall performance. Merton (1981) and Henriksson and Merton (1981)
develop a more general approach to measure macroforecasting ability.
All of these studies, however, share one common assumption, namely that
managers allocate their funds to one risk—free asset and a portfolio chosen

from a universe of risky securities. The nominally risk—free asset is

commonly taken to be a Treasury—bill of maturity equal to the portfolio

rebalancing interval. A large number of individual and institutional
investors use money—market funds as proxies for risk—free investments.2 The

keen competition among these money—market funds (MMF) for the investor's
dollar inevitably leads to the question of another kind of macroforecasting

ability, i.e., the prediction of short—term movements in the yield curve. The
measurement and economic value of interest rate forecasting by MMF managers is
the subject of this paper.

Two approaches to the study of this question have appeared in print so

far, both by Fern and Oberhelrnan (1981a, 1981b). In the earlier paper Fern
and Oberhelman (1981a) use the CAPM framework to measure the performance of

MMFs as they would have with any other portfolio. The trouble with this
approach when applied to MMFs is that it is quite sensitive to the choice of

benchmark as discussed in Roll (1979). Roll raised the problem with reference
to the identity of a benchmark risky portfolio when the performance of equity

fund managers is measured. In analyzing the performance of MMFs the more
relevant question is the identity of the efficient zero—beta portfolio and its

expected return. The robustness of using T—bills as the benchmark zero—beta
portfolio in the evaluation of the performance of (very low beta) portfolios
of MMFs is unclear at this point.

In their later study, Fern and Oberhelman (1981b) use an alternative,
indirect approach. They argue that the attempt of MMF managers to apply yield
curve forecasting to their portfolio decison results in a continuous

adjustment of their portfolios' average maturity. Accordingly, they correlate
changes in average maturity with subsequent changes in short—term interest

rates to judge the forecasting ability of fund managers. Their conclusion is

—2—.

that, on average, MMF managers exhibit a significant ability to forecast

changes in interest rates. In developing their methodology, however, Fern
and Oberhelman fail to avoid a number of important pitfalls which might be
responsible for their results as will be discussed below.

The present paper uses Merton's (1981) methodology to test the MMF

managers' ability to forecast interest rates. We take special care in
identifying the nature of the changes in interest rates, the forecast of which
is implied by changes in average maturities of MMF portfolios. In contrast to

Fern and Oberhelman (1981b), we do not use the aggregate MMF portfolio.
Rather, we explore the change in average maturity of individual MMF portfolios
relative to subsequent changes in interest rates.
In developing the methodology we estimate the potential earnings to MMFs

from interest rate forecasting using 1—bill and CD data for the 1978—1981

period. We find that the performance of the majority of the MMFs in our
sample of 34 funds did not exhibit a significant ability to forecast
in interest rates over the test period of 1978—1981.

changes

At the same time,

however, we find that a few funds exhibited such ability to a statistically

significant degree. Still, because of the low magnitude of the actual changes
in their portfolio maturities, even those funds could not achieve anywhere
near the potential economic performance (in terms of rates of return earned)
that would have been possible with such ability.3
We also explain how the aggregation procedure can account for the upbeat

results of Fern and Oberhelnian (1981b). Section II develops the methodology
of the tests. Results are presented in section III.

Section IV concludes.

II. METHODOLOGY
In this paper we take the approach that the forecasting ability of MMF
managers manifests itself in the changes they make in the maturity structure

of their portfolio. "Forecasting changes in interest rates, however, is not
a clearly defined concept. MMF managers are, at least implicitly, concerned
with changes in the whole relevant range of the term structure of interest
rates (i.e., up to maturity of 1 year) and thus their appropriate response
consists of changes in the full—blown maturity structure of their portfolios.
In empirical research it would be next to impossible to correlate changes in
the entire maturity strucutre of portfolios with the subsequent change in the

entire yield curve. In restricting the nature of the test to some practical

measure one jeopardizes its validity. Thus we first turn our attention to
this issue.

11.1 RELATING CHANGES IN AVERAGE MATURITY TO SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN INTEREST
RATE S

Fern and Oberhelman (1981b) measure changes in average maturity which
take place over the last one and two weeks of every month. They go on to
measure changes in the yield to maturity of 90—day securities4 over the next

one and two months. A successful prediction is recorded if a rise in the
90—day yield was preceded by a shortening of the MMF average maturity and vice

versa. This experiment is perfectly valid if the yield curve always remains
flat over the MMF's maturity range. Since the yield curve is, in general,
neither flat nor affected by a mere shift upward or downward, such an
experiment, henceforth referred to as the yield experiment, is

of

limited

validity. In particular it is possible that the current forecast of a MMF

—4—

manager is for 90 day rates to go up over the prediction horizon, yet
lengthening the average maturity of the portfolio would still yield a better

rate of return than leaving it unchanged. Two possible cases are shown in
Figure 1.

In both cases, 1(a) and 1(b), the initial yield curve, y0(t), is

flat and in both cases 90—day yields in the subsequent yield curve y(t)

and y(t), are actually higher. However, the nature of the change in the
entire yield curve for bonds of initial maturity

a

b

M0 and M0,

respectively, is such that they could improve their holding period return by

lengthening their average maturity to M and M.
An alternative experiment restricts the changes in the yield curve over

the holding period to a more general class. Denote the price, at time s, of a
pure discount bond with maturity, 1, by P(s,T). With a holding period, t, the
final price is P(s+t,T—t) and the holding period return is

— P(s+t,
R' + -r' —
/

P(s

T.-t)

—

1)

The alternative experiment requires that changes in the yield
curve during
the interval (s,s÷t) are such that the rate of return on any pure discount
bond with maturity, T, will be equal to that of a two—bond benchmark portfolio
with maturities Ti,, 12 so that

R(s+t,T) =

xR(s+t,11)

÷ (1—x)R(s+t,T2)

where

returns be
For this condition to hold it is necessary that holding period
linear in maturity, i.e.,

R(s,T) =

a5b5T

In order to see the restriction on changes in the yield curve imposed by this
assumption, denote the annual, continuously compounded yield to maturity at

time s for any maturity by Y(s,T). Then:

P(s,T) = exp[—Y(s,T)T]

and

R(s+t,T) =

exp[Y(s,T)T

-

Y(s+t,T-t)(T-t)]

- 1

(3)

The linearity of R(s+t,T) in T, together with (3), requires that

Y(s+t,T-t)

=

Y(s,T)

-

log(a+bT)

(4)

Thus the validity of the experiment requires that changes in the yield curve
will be limited to a two—parameter shift given by:5 -.-log(a+bT) and
forecasters are required to forecast the parameters (a,b). This experiment is

—6—

more general than the yield experiment which restricts b=o and accounts for
the initial maturity so that it does not suffer pitfalls as demonstrated in
Figure 1.

For this experiment in the present study (henceforth called the rate of
return experiment) we chose for the benchmark portfolio the maturities T1=30

days, 12=90 days and the holding period t=7 days. Thus we recorded a
successful prediction whenever a decrease in average maturity for a MMF over a

given week was followed by R(7,30) >

R(7,90) for the next week and vice versa.

We undertook to measure the importance of the nature of the experiment by
correlating the weekly indicated change in average maturity under these two

alternative experiments. To reiterate, if one uses the yield experiment, then
a successful prediction is recorded when an increase (decrease) in

90—day

yields over a given week is preceded by a decrease (increase) in the average

maturity of a MMF portfolio. If, on the other hand, one uses the rate of
return test (on 30-. vs. 90—day bonds), then a successful prediction is

recorded when a higher (lower) rate of return on 30—day bonds (relative to
90—day bonds) over a given week is preceded by a decrease (increase) in the
average maturity of a MMF portfolio.

Analysis of the indicated direction of the change in average maturity for
the two experiments over the sample period is presented in Table 1. As Table

1 indicates, the two methods of measuring changes in the yield curve
prescribed identical maturity changes (in direction) for 173 out of 206 weeks
(84.0 percent) for 1—bill portfolios and for 101 out of 163 weeks (62.0

percent) for Certificates of Deposit portfolios. Since CDs constitute the
larger share of MMF holdings in the sample (see Table 2), the 62 percent

agreement is more indicative of the possible loss of validity in

—7—

concentrating

on only one of these experiments above. One could seriously misjudge the
prediction of MMF managers from average maturity changes by choosing,
arbitrarily, one of these two possible experiments (as well as, perhaps,

others). In the study we use only periods (weeks) for which both measurements
of interest rate changes would have led to the same direction of the change in

average maturity. It is assumed that when these two measurements agree it is
unlikely that the nature of the actual changes in the entire yield curve over
these weeks were such that they would have indicated opposite changes in
average maturity in preceding weeks.

We now turn to the issue of the types of securities acutally held by the
MMF s.

11.2 THE INTEREST BEARING SECURITIES USED TO MEASURE CHANGES IN THE YIELD
CURVE

MMFs hold, for the most part, three types of securities: Treasury bills
(TB), bank certificates of deposit (CD), and commercial papers (CP). These

securities are not identical, as evidenced by their risk premia. Figure 2
shows the risk premia of 90—day CDs over TBs of equal maturities. The graph
demonstrates that the type of bond used to measure yields is important.

The

relative holdings of these securiteis by MMF5 has been changing markedly over
time, as is indicated in Table 2.

In order to examine how important it is to use the appropriate bonds when
recording successful and unsuccessful changes in maturities, we contrast the
prescribed direction of the change in average maturity when the yield (or the
rate of return) method is applied to any of the three types of bonds. Table 3
presents the results for the yield experiment, which were similar to those of

—8—

the rate of return experiments. Comparing the consistency of prescribed
changes with the most widely held MMF securities, Table 3(a) indicates that
24.7 percent of the weeks provide conflicting results. The consistency of
measurement using TB yields vs. CP and CD is even worse, with 34.4 percent and

27.1 percent, respectively, conflicting prescriptions. These results raise

another problem with Fern and Oberhelman's (1981b) study which uses CDs
only. In order to avoid the loss of validity due to different

security

holdings by various MMFs, we concentrate on periods for which the indicated
changes in average maturity (as measured with both alternative ways) for all
three security holders agree.

So far we opted to restrict the observations to weeks when a successful
change in average maturity is indicated by both the yield and the rate of
return experiments (section 11.1) and to those when the same successful change

applies to all three major securities: TB, CD, and CP. Table 4 summarizes
the number of available observations and reemphasizes the pitfalls from using
observations indiscriminately.

The analysis of maturity changes by MMFs that was conducted by Fern and
Oberhelman concerns the average portfolio of all MMFs in their sample.
Consequently they argue that their favorable conclusion applies to the average

fund. The validity of this assessment is addressed next.

11.3 SHOULD MMF PORTFOLIOS BE AGGREGATED IN AN EXPERIMENT TO DETERMINE OVERALL
FORECASTING ABILITY BY MANAGERS

Consider a population of N forecasters who are trying to predict the
outcomes of a binomial process,

In order to determine the properties of the

In particular, the correlation coefficient between any two forecasts at time t

so that when em = e 1/2, the correlation is perfect, etc. Under these

This result gives us the first idea about results from aggregate forecasts. A
small forecasting ability of individual managers can generate a powerful

average forecast when many forecasts are used. Since most investors
diversify MMF holdings among many funds,

the performance of the average

forecasts might be a misleading statistic.

For concreteness, consider the

(1981b). They report a measure of

direction of change in 90—day CD

of association, Q, is defined as:6

With a single forecaster's ability, e, the correlation between the forecast,

and the realization, X, is

(12)

and hence

= 1 1 2.4/2
Thus, for Q = .28 we arrive at p

(13)

= .14.

If we assume, again, that the

individual managers are identical and issue conditionally independent
forecasts we can use (9) to infer the individual

forecasting ablity, e.

The number of MMFs in Fern and Oberhelman's study varies over the sample
period 1975—1980. If we take a reasonable average number of N = 50 MMFs, then
(9) produces a low individual forecasting ability of

—13—

e = .01,

i.e.,

= p1+P2_1 =

1.02.

As we will show later, such ability has

little economic value. In our sample of 34 MMFs with weekly data for the

period 1978—1981, the sample average *

for

all MMFs was 0.11 and assuming

symmetry and identical ability it implies e = .055.

Using (9), we expect a

correlation coefficient for the average forecast of p

= .54,

and * = 0.54.

implying e = .27

The actual statistic for the average portfolio was p* =

0.43.

To check whether the actual lower figure is due to the heterogeneity of the
sample we assumed it consists of two classes of identical superior and

inferior forecasters. Out of 34 MMF5, the best four exhibited an average

0.38,

P =

all significant at the 1 percent level. The best eight exhibited an

average *

= 0.31,

all significant at the 5 percent level or better. Table 5

presents the implied quality of the average forecast and demonstrates that the
actual lower average forecast quality is probably not due to the assumption of

homogeneity. Another cause might be some positive conditional dependence of
the MMFs forecast —— an issue which is left to a later section.
All in all, the foregoing analysis shows that measuring aggregate
performance may serve as a powerful test to discover weak forecasting ability

among many forecasters. It should not, however, be misinterpreted as
indicative of strong individual ability from the quality of the average

forecast. In the present study we concentrate on the individual ability of
MMF managements.

We now turn to the discussion of the economic value and the measure to be
used for the individual forecasting ability of MMFs.

11.4 THE PERFORMANCE MEASURE AND EcONqMIc VALUE OF MMF MANAGEMENTS' YIELD
F OR E CA ST r NG

The state of the art of the determination of the economic value of
forecasting ability (applied to stock market timing) is found in Merton

(1981). The case examined by Merton involves a portfolio manager who limits
his activity to the allocation of investment funds between a risk—free

security and a prespecified risky asset, say, the market portfolio. At any
time, t, with a horizon of T periods, the manager compares the known gross
yield to maturity on the risk—free asset, R(t) =

1+r(t),

the gross rate of return on the risky portfolio, Z(t) =

with his forecast of

1+z(t).

Defining

perfect foresight as the ability to choose the security with the higher
ex—post rate of return, Merton shows that a dollar invested by a manager with
perfect foresight yields a rate of return identical to that of a portfolio
consisting of a dollar invested in the risky security plus a call option,

valued at c(t), on a 1 share in the risky portfolio, with maturity T and
excercise price R(t)7. Therefore, the economic value expressed as a rate of
return premium to perfect foresight is given by,8

c(t) =

the cumulative standard normal distribution function,

(14)

is

the standard deviation of the rate of return on the risky portfolio and the
formula (14) is a simplification of the Black—Schole's call option valuation

formula when the exercise price equals the risk—free rate.
For our purpose we need to adapt the model to a case where the MMF manager
chooses between two prespecified risky securities, say a 30— and a 90—day

—15—

1—bill. Let Z(t) correspond to the rate of return on the longer term and R(t)
to the stochastic rate of return on the shorter term bond. With perfect
foresight defined as before, a dollar invested by the manager will yield a
rate of return identical to that of a portfolio consisting of 1 invested in

the short term bond plus a call option on a 1 position in the long term bond
with the call maturity T and stochastic exercise price R(t). The economic
value of perfect foresight under these conditions is therefore derived from

the value of a call option with a stochastic exercise price [Merton (1973),

Fisher (1978)]. Suppose that the price dynamics of the short term bond is
described by:9

dB(t) = B(t)czRdt + B(t)aRdWR

The actual gross holding period rate of return on the bond over the interval
(t,t+T) is

The stochastic exercise price for the

call on the longer term bond is exp[R(t)—1] which, following Merton (1981), we

approximate by R(t). The realized holding period rate of return on the longer

where s2(t) is the variance rate of the difference between the rates of

c(t) =

2N[s(t)TU2]

- 1

To measure the economic value of perfect

(15)

foresight management by MMF

managers, we first observed actual weekly 1—bill prices over the period

1978—1981. Specifically, we observed maturities as close as possible to 23,
30, 83 and 90 days so that, for example, the

continuously compounded holding

period return on a 30—day 1—bill over week t is:

log B(t,23)/B(t_1,30)

then computed the annual realized rate of return for three strategies:

.

We

(i)

hold the 30—day 1—bill, (ii) hold the 90—day bill, (iii) hold the bill
which yielded the higher ex—post rate for each week. The results of this
experiment for the overall period and two sub—periods are presented in Table

6. For the overall period of 1978—1981 the realized annual rates of return on
30— and 90—day bills were 10.26 and 10.80 percent, respectively, and we assume
that the difference of .56 percent per annum represents risk adjustment. On

the other hand, the return of 12.28 percent to the perfect foresight strategy

reflects a risk—free premium of 2.02 percent per annum to perfect foresight
management.
It is well known [Bodie, Kane and McDonald, (1983)] that interest rates

became more volatile (to date) since October 1979, a fact which is also

reflected in the table. Commensurately, the premium that would have been
realized with perfect foresight over the period 1980—81 is 3.24 percent per

year. Note that the standard deviation for the difference between the
realized rates on 30— and 90—day bills is .72 percent and .94 percent per
annum for the overall period and the 1980—81 subperiod, respectively. These

standard deviations reflect a correlation coefficient between the rates of

0.75. Substituting these estimates for s(t) in (15), we obtain a theoretical
estimate of the premium to perfect foresight as 2.11 percent for the overall
period and 2.75 percent for the 1980—81 period.

The theoretical estimates of

the premia from (15) are more reliable than the measured premia because the
latter depend on the variance estimate alone (see Merton, 1980), while the

empirical ex post measures assume that the period averages equal ex ante means.
We repeated the same experiment for CD strategies.

This experiment has

the empirical problem of lack of data for the 23— and 83—day maturities.
Thus, we approximated BCD(t,23) and BCD(t,83) by BCD(t,3O)

and

BCD(t,9O). Because of these less reliable estimates, we only report here
that the estimate of the theoretical premium to perfect foresight with CDs is
2.75 percent over the 1978—81 period (compared to 2.11 percent for 1—bills),
reflecting a slightly greater variance of CD rates and therefore greater
forecasting value.

It is interesting to speculate on the value of perfect foresight if, for

—18—

the longer bond, managers used a 180—day instead of a 90—day rnaturity)0 We
use the assumption underlying the validity of the rate of return experiment,
stated by (2) and (4), i.e., that the 180—day 1—bill rate is given by:

R(t,180) = —1.5R(t,3o) +

2.5R(t,90)

Thus, using the variance and correlation estimates for R(t,30) and R(t,90), we
obtained a standard deviation for the difference R(t,180) —

R(t,30)

of 1.72

percent for the 1978—81 period. Substituting this figure into (15) yields a
perfect foresight premium of 5.07 percent per year.'1 Between 1978—79 and
1980—81 periods, MMFs shortened their average maturities reflecting, at least,
a recognition on their part of less than perfect foresight ability which led
them to forego the larger potential gains.

Merton (1981) goes on to prove that with less than perfect foresight, the
conditional probabilities:

P1 =
=

Pr(lengthen maturity

Pr(shorten

maturity

ex—post justified)
ex—post justified)

provide sufficient information to assign economic value to their forecasting

ability. In particular, P* =

P1+P2.....1

is a sufficient statistic for that

value which implies that the symmetry in ability (P1=P2) is of no
importance, as well as the symmetry in realization, i.e., whether one outcome

is more frequent. Thus the value of the forecast in (15) adapted to a
specific forecasting ability is p*c(t).

Finally, Merton considers the value of forecasting ability when not all

—19—

funds are switched according to the forecast. Specifically, when XR is
invested in the short bond when the forecast is favorable to it (and l_Xk in
the less favorable long bond) and Xk is invested in the short bond when the
forecast favors the long bond, then the value of the forecast becomes:12

m(t) =

where A(t) =

A(t)P*c(t)

Xh(t)_Xk(t).

(16)

In our case by (2),

Xm =

(Tk_T2)/(Tl_T2)

Hence Xh_Xk =

(TR_Tk)/(Tl_T2)

for m =

h,k

and thus the value of forecasting

ability is prportonal to the change in average maturity as a proportion of the
maturity difference in the bench mark bonds.13
Armed with these results we are able to analyze the actual data from our
MMFs sample.

III. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF THE MONEY MARKET FUNDS OVER THE PERIOD
1978 — 1981

111.1 The Sample Data
The MMF maturity data were obtained from the Donoghue Money Market Fund

report for the period 1978—1981. We kept in the sample all MMFs (34 funds)

for which the average maturity was included in all reports. The Report also
lists, in addition to the average maturity, the market value of the portfolio
of the MMFs.

—20—

As explained earlier, the weekly observations had to be trimmed down to
include only weeks for which the favorable change in average maturity is

unambiguous by our assumption about the nature of the change in the yield

curve. The overall number of weeks which qualified for performance

measurement is given in Table 4. The overall number of avaialble weeks (69)
is not distributed evenly over the period. Table 4 also shows the breakdown

for the two—year subperiods, 1978—79 and 1980—81. The relatively low number
of available weeks for the period 1978—79 (24) renders estimates for this
subperiod less reliable.

Weekly 90—day yields—to—maturity and realized rates of return on T—bills
and CDs of 30— and 90—day maturities were taken from the Wall Street Journal.
The 90—day CP yields were obtained from Business Week.

111.2 Forecasting Ability
Before we present estimates of forecasting ability we should qualify the
results by stating that it is not established that all

funds change maturity

solely in an attempt to exploit yield curve forecasts. The need for liquidity
and risk preference may, for some periods at least, be an important

consideration. To this extent, estimatates that derive forecasting ability
from maturity changes may be noisy and thus biased downwards in statistical
signficance.

Table 7 summarizes the estimates of the conditional

probabilities, P1

and P2, for the 34 MMFs in the sample for the overall period (1978—81) and

the two—year subperiods. The bottom line of the table shows that, taking the
aggregate portfolio of all MMFs, the combined forecast is potentially

valuable. The statitistic P* =

P1+P2—1 for the aggregate portfolio over

—21—

the period is .43, which means that if all funds were to be switched between
the short and long maturity benchmark securities, these forecasts would retain

43 percent of the value of perfect foresight management. As was argued in
Section 2.3, however, these results might be driven, at least in part, by the
The two

sheer number of the MMFs with even marginal forecasting ability.
lines next to the bottom of the table show that the simple average

for

of *

the 34 MMF5 in the sample is .11, and, when weighted by asset size,

.17. (The

difference is not statistically significant and the question of the

relationshiup between * and asset size is discussed below.)
The estimates for the overall period show 8 MMFs with *

statistics

which

are significantly different from zero, ranging from .63 to .22. (Note that
the aggregate portfolio performed better than the second best MMF.)

111.3 The Consistency and Symmetry of the Estimated Forecasting Ability

The rank correlation for * between the two subperiods is quite low (.04)
and not significantly different from zero. Because the low forecasting
ability of most MMF5 in the sample may be introducing noise into the
correlation estimate, we also use a 2x2 chi—square test to check for

consistency of * over the subperiods. The chi—square value from the test was
.72 with 1 degree of freedom suggesting that there is no consistency in

performance over the two subperiods. This result, however, has to be
qualified due to the small number of observations in the early period
(1978—79).

Another interesting question is the symmetry of the estimated forecasting

ability. Here, too, the problem with the aggregate portfolio shows up. The
aggregate portfolio exhibits a signiicantly better ability to forecast yield

—22—

curve changes which favor a reduction in average maturity, i.e., P1 =
compared to those that favor an increase in average maturity,

P2 =

.81,

.61.

But

the estimates for the average MMF tell a different story. The difference
between P1 and P2 is smaller and in the opposite direction. For the
simple average, P1 =

.50 and P2 = .61, and the difference is smaller for

the weighted average (P1 =

.54,

P2 =

.62).

These numbers suggest that MMF

managers might be able to forecast better yield changes which favor
lengthening the portfolio average maturity.

11.4 Does the Sample Suggest that MMF Managers Are Able Forecasters

The most important question concerning the estimates of * for various
MMFs (and their statistical significance) is:

To what extent can these

results be attributed to sampling phenomena. To be specific, Table 7
indicates that 9 MMFs exhibit P greater than .2, i.e., the potential value of
their forecast is 20 percent (or better) of the value of perfect foresight.
For each MMF the distribution of the P* statistic is hypergeometric

(Henriksson and Merton, 1981). Suppose that for the i—th MMF we estimate
= Pr(P*>Q=.2 p*0), i.e., the probability that with no forecasting ability
a

sample of observations will yield P*>.2. Using the 34 estimtes of
have the expected number, n, of MMFs with P*>=.2 (under

H0

we

P. = 0;

for i=1,...,34) as E(n) =

The heavy line in Figure 3 represents the number of MMFs for which the
estimated value exceeds various levels of *

The dashed line (the lowest

line) represents the expected number of MMFs at each level of P* assuming no

forecasting ability on the part of all MMFs in the sample. From these two
graphs one has to conclude that the nuber of "able" MMFs is beyond expectation

—23—

under the null hypothesis of no forecasting

ability. For Q=.2, for example,

we have 9 MMFs which exceed it compared with 2 MMF5 which could be expected to

do so. To assess this inference we construct a graph for a 95 percent
confidence interval above the expectation line in Figure 3 assuming that MMF

forecasts are independent. This line, while lying well above the expectation
line, still shows that some MMF managers have to be considered able

forecasters. For Q=.2, the 95 percent confidence bound is only 5 compared to
the actual (9).

One may question the assumption of independent forecsts, however. To
establish the confidence interval with dependent forecasts we need to estimate

Var(n) = Var( c) when Corr(ct1c) =
a2 + a2

+ 2a

0.

In this case, Var( ctj) =

The correlation coefficient, r. 13.,

is

a complex two

two stage linear transformation of the correlation between forecasts, ir

Corr(Y1V).

First because

=

is a statistic with a binomial

distribution and second because the

statistics (underlying the aj)

is hypergeometrically distributed. Thus it requires a stretch of the
imagination to use the forecast correlation matrix,

to infer r1. As

a first step we consider the foundation of the independence assumption. This
would require the independence of the conditional forecasts:

=

Corr(Y1Y

=

Corr(YY

lengthening maturity is favorable)
shortening maturity is favorable)

Table 8 indicates that both sets of conditional correlation coefficients
appear to be distributed normally with a mean of .05, which is statistically

significant. It is interesting to check whether the conditional correlation

—24—

coefficients are different among the top 8 MMFs.

In Table 8 the mean of p(—)

is .08 and for p(+) is .03. In both cases the means are not significantly
different from those of the overall sample. The correlation coefficients
between the unconditional forecasts have a mean of .04 with a standard

deviation of .082 (somewhat surprisingly) similar to those of the conditional

forecasts. These correlation coefficients could be used to estimate the
correlation between the

statistic (r) only if the transformation were

linear. Yet, since the data suggest that the

must be correlated, we use

these means as justification to present the range of .05—.10 for r1 in

constructing the confidence limits as our best guess. The remaining two lines
in Figure 3 show the 95 percent confidence limits based on

.10. The higher line of the two (for

r1 = .10)

= .05 and

traces the actual graph

almost exactly except for the single, top MMF which logged P* =

.62.

Thus the

question of whether the forecasting ability demonstrated by the MMFs is just a
sample phenomenon cannot be answered with confidence although the evidence
seems to favor the hypthesis that a small number of MMF managers did exhibit
superior forecasting skills.

111.5 The Actual Economic Value of the MMFs Forecasting Ability
It is tempting to try to relate the actual rates of return for the various

MMFs to their demonstrated forecasting ability. A priori, the difficulties in
this approach are mainly two: First, a good number of these funds use the
amortized premium accounting method which would obscure any distinction of
performance which is attributable to forecasting ability.

Second, the

constant change of the MMFs' portfolio composition in terms of the various
securities would make it impossible to separate the timing from the selection

—25—

skills, if any. Finally, using actual returns would imply that ex post
returns can be taken to reflect ex ante means.

Thus we have to resort to the

indirect method explained in Section 2.4, where we made additional use of
Mertori's (1981) model. We showed that under our assumptions, with the

benchmark securities being T—bills of 30— and 90—day maturity, the economic
value of their forecasting skills is given by p*c(t).

We have shown above

that c(t) is of the order of magnitude of 2 percent premium to the annual risk

adjusted rate of return. There are 8 MMFs which exceed p*.22 with
statistical significance and hence could potentially realize 22—62 percent of

that premium. What factor, , should be used for this potential annual gain
of p*c(t) =

.5 — 1.5 percent Table 9 presents the average change in maturity

(in days) over the sample period. The first column shows the averages for the
weeks used to measure performance. The first panel accounts for the overall
period. These numbers show that the best four MMFs behaved similarly to the
other 28. Using 3 days as the average change in maturity yields

=

.05, which is so low as to practically eliminate any potential gain

3/60 =
from

forecasting ability. Note also that the aggregate portfolio average change in
maturity (1.73 days) reflects the interfund forecast variability and assures
that whatever advantage one obtains from forecast averaging (P*=.43) might be
lost by averaging the intended maturity change, since

.03.

We are led to conclude that even if some of the MMF managers have any
forecasting ability they either lack in confidence or in recognition of their
own skills or, more likely, are prevented by institutional constraints from

taking advantage of them. The second column in Table 9 is presented for a
good reason. It shows that the weeks used to measure performance are not
significantly different in terms of maturity decisions from other weeks, and

—26—

if at all, the changes during these weeks are actually smaller. Recall that
the weeks used for performance evaluation

are those for which the 90—day yield

changes and the realized rate of return differential between 30— and 90—day
securities of the three bond types (TB,

CP, CD) all favor the same directional

change in maturity. One expects these weeks to coincide with relatively
severe changes in the yield curve. Table 10 shows that this is indeed the
case. The changes in yields and rate of return differentials are double or
more for the weeks used to measure performance. If it is easier to forecast
more severe changes in the yield curve, then our performance measurement in
the preceding section is biased in favor of
probably not the case since changes in

MMF managers. This, however, is

average maturity are not larger during

these weeks, indicating that managers, at least, do not feel that way.

111.6 The Relationship Between

Forecasting Ability and Asset Size and Growth

As Table 8 indicated, the weighted average of P for the MMF sample (.17)
is higher than the simple average (.11). This raises the question of whether
the managers of larger MMFs possess better forecasting skills. Since the

management fee is proportional to asset size, one would expect that larger
MMFs will be able to allocate more

resources to yield curve forecasting and

thus, if it is at all possible, should perform better.

Table 11 suggests that

this propostiion is not supported by the evidence, either because larger MMFs
do not allocate more resources to

forecasting or that additional resources do

not result in better forecasts. The simple and Spearman rank correlation

coefficients between * and asset size either at the end of 1978 or 1981
are
low and not significantly different from zero.
A related question is whether revealed

—27—

forecasting ability results in the

success of a MMF as a business, when measured by the rate of growth in asset

size over the period 1978—81. The simple and rank correlation coefficients
between P and the magnitude of assets growth as show in Table 11 indicate
that the answer to this question is also negative. This could be a result of
the fact that investors recognize, as we showed earlier, that even MMFs with

revealed forecasting ability did not generate any significant economic value.
Of course, one cannot reject the conclusion that forecasting ability goes
unrewarded in the market place which, in turn, explains why the larger MMFs
would not try harder, which in turn explains why there is no correlation
between size and performance.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Previous investigation suggested that money market fund managers
demonstrated ability to anticipate changes in short term yields by changing
their portfolio average maturity in the direction considered consistent with

subsequent changes in the yield curve. This paper demonstrated that the
question was inadequately addressed by (1) aggregating the sample MMF
portfolios, (ii) measuring their performance with inadequate statistics,
(iii)

determining the adequate direction of change on the basis of

subsequent changes in the 90—day yield to maturity and (iv) using CDs as
representative of the money market fund portfolio composition.

We proceeded

to observe the maturity behavior of individual money markt funds and adopted
Merton's (1981) model to measure the forecasting skills and economic value of
yield curve management by money market fund mangers.
We recorded the adequacy of changes in portfolio maturity in a way which
is valid up to a two parameter shift in the yield curve.

—28—

We used only weeks

when the favorable direction of change in portfolio maturity is consistent for
1—bills, CDs and CPs whether the benchmark is the subsequent change in the
90—day yield to matuirity or the difference in the realized rate of return on
30— vs. 90—day securities.

Results show that some funds do demonstrate forecasting ability.
Measuring the average weekly change in maturity, however, shows that these
were sufficiently small to devoid the demonstrated skills of any economic

value. It was also shown that larger money market fund mangers do not
demonstrate better forecasting skills and that, in turn, revealed forecasting

skills are not rewarded by faster growth in the money market fund assets.

Footnotes

1. See Merton (1980) and I-ienriksson and Merton (1981) for references.

2. For example, as of June 1981 the total market value of short term
financial assets (i.e., T—bills of up to 6 month maturity, CPs, CDs and

bankers' acceptances) was 574.5 billion dollars and the total market value
of the assets held by money market funds amounted to 126.4 billion

dollars, dispersed among slightly more than 100 funds.

3. We do not confront the question of whther MMFs should even attempt to do
so. One can argue that MMF5 should precommit themselves to specific
maturities and short—term instruments and leave the interest rates
forecasting theatre to managers of interest futures funds. It is also

possible that these funds restricted themselves in changing their
portfolio maturity due to risk consideration.

4. We relegate the discussion of the identity of the bonds to a later section.
5. This restriction of the nature of the change in the yield curve implies,
implicitly, the expectation hypothesis, for if the yield curve
incorporates liquidity premia,. then the

lefthand side in (4) must include

the adjustment term for the liquidity premium.

6. See Kendall and Stuart (1977, pp. 536—538), as cited by Fern and
Oberhelman (1981b).

7. This portfolio is also identical to a 1 share in the risky portfolio plus
a put option on that share with a maturity T and exercise price R(t).

8. The expression in (14) assumes that the manager collects fees (if any) at
the end of the period. Merton assumes that in equilibrium, fees equal to
the economic value are decucted up front, so that per dollar invested by
client, the value is c(t)I[1+c(t)].

9. If the holding period, T (which is in our case one week), is short
relative to the maturity of the bond (30 or 90 days in our case), then the
assumption of a constant mean and variance rates (c&,a2) for the price
dynamics is reasonable.

10. Note that over the period 1978—79 the average maturity of the MMFs in the
sample was around 70—90 days, which was reduced to around 25—35 days
during the next subperiod.

11. Merton's results for the market portfolio with, say, 20 percent annual
standard deviation is 43.7 percent.

12. This result requires the assumption that securities are priced to satisfy
the security market line.

13. Note that changing the benchmark bonds will also change the variance of
the rate difference in c(t) and leave the economic value of the forecast
unchanged —

if the assumption of the linearity of rates in maturity is

preserved.
