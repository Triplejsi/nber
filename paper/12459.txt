Science and Industry: Tracing the Flow of Basic Research Through Manufacturing and Trade
James D. Adams and J. Roger Clemmons
NBER Working Paper No. 12459
August 2006
JEL No. D2, O3
ABSTRACT

This paper describes flows of basic research through the U.S. economy and explores their
implications for scientific output at the industry and field level. The time period is the late 20th
century. This paper differs from others in its use of measures of science rather than technology.
Together its results provide a more complete picture of the structure of basic research flows than was
previously available.
Basic research flows are high within petrochemicals and drugs and within a second cluster
composed of software and communications. Flows of chemistry, physics, and engineering are
common throughout industry; biology and medicine are almost confined to petrochemicals and
drugs, and computer science is nearly as limited to software and communications. In general, basic
research flows are more concentrated within scientific fields than within industries.
The paper also compares effects of different types of basic research on scientific output. The
main finding is that the academic spillover effect significantly exceeds that of industrial spillovers
or industry basic research. Finally, within field effects exceed between field effects, while the
within- and between industry effects are equal. Therefore, scientific fields limit basic research flows
more than industries.

1. Introductory Remarks
Using a new body of evidence, this paper describes flows of basic research through the U.S.
economy and explores their implications for scientific output in industries and fields. Besides
the description of basic research flows, the analysis specifies the role of industry and field
barriers in limiting R&D spillovers to industries and fields. To undertake the study we use data
on scientific papers written in firms and universities as well as citations made and received by
the papers. This article differs from others in its examination of flows of scientific knowledge,
rather than flows of applied technology.
Findings are as follows. Basic research flows are most intense in a cluster of petrochemicals
and drugs and in a second cluster composed of software and communications. Flows of
chemistry, physics, and engineering are general throughout industry; biology and medicine are
almost confined to drugs and petrochemicals, and computer science is nearly as limited to
software and communications. In general, basic research flows are more concentrated within
fields than within industries.
In addition we assess comparative effects of different basic research flows, primarily R&D
spillovers, on output of scientific papers in an industry and field. The measure of effect is the
elasticity of scientific papers with respect to basic research flows. We find that the academic
spillover elasticity exceeds the industrial spillover elasticity and the elasticity of the industry
R&D stock. For academic and industrial spillovers we find that the within field elasticity
exceeds the between field elasticity. Finally, the within and between industry elasticities for the
industrial spillover are roughly equal. These findings form the basis for our claim that field is
more a barrier to knowledge flows than industry is.

Both descriptively and in terms of the explanation of scientific output, we find that aggregate
R&D spillovers are a more comprehensive measure of knowledge flows than citation rates. This
is because spillovers capture frequency of citation events as well as size of the cited R&D stock.
All this is despite much recent emphasis on citation rates as a measure of knowledge flows.
The prior literature mostly consists of studies of flows of applied research among industries
and technologies. Terleckyj (1974) and Griliches (1979) emphasize the importance of
interindustry flows for productivity growth. Using data on patents and R&D performed in lines
of business owned by large U.S. firms in 1974, Scherer (1982a) computes a matrix of
interindustry technology flows. Using this he reassigns firms’ patents from industries where
R&D is performed to industries of use, in order to calculate flows of R&D dollars between
industries. The results indicate that most R&D is used outside the industry. Scherer (1982b)
shows that R&D “used” has a significant effect on labor productivity while R&D “performed”
does not. Using a different sample and method Griliches and Lichtenberg (1984) find similar
results, though with a larger role for R&D performed. Mueller and Culbertson (1986) find
something similar, that extra-industry innovations drive productivity gains in food processing.
Interindustry flows of technology play a significant role in industrial organization, economic
history, urban economics, and management. General Purpose Technologies or GPTs (Bresnahan
and Trajtenberg, 1995) are a dramatic case of interindustry technology flows. GPTs are defined
as having wide applicability to downstream sectors and as increasing the returns to both earlier
and subsequent technologies. Rosenberg (1963) offers an example of an early GPT, the machine
tools industry in the 19th century U.S. economy. In a related study Rosenberg (1979) confirms
the broad role of capital goods and materials suppliers as sources of technology flows to user
industries in the past.

2

Jacobs (1969) emphasizes the flow of ideas across industries within cities, as well as the
guiding role of industry diversity in urban prosperity. Glaeser et al. (1992) and Henderson et al.
(1995) find empirical support for this view, in that initially diversified cities exhibit faster growth
of employment and wages. In management studies, Klevorick et al. (1995) find that half the
industries in the Yale Survey on Industrial Research and Development report sizable in-flows of
technology from other industries. Likewise Von Hippel (1988) finds that innovation often
begins with customers and suppliers located in different industries from the manufacturer.
Other research explores limits to knowledge flows thrown up by industries, technologies, and
sciences. Differences in scientific employment bound R&D spillovers between industries in
Adams (1990). Even within firms technology groups are barriers to idea flows in Adams and
Jaffe (1996) and Adams (1999). Patent classes limit rates of patent citation in Jaffe and
Trajtenberg (1999), and science fields limit rates of science citation in Adams, Clemmons, and
Stephan (2004 and forthcoming). Industry and field barriers to knowledge flows also arise in
this paper’s study of basic research flows through the U.S. economy1.
The rest of the paper consists of four sections. Section 2 discusses measurement of mean
citation rates to basic research and aggregate spillovers of basic research. In comparing the two
statistics it argues for the spillover as the more comprehensive measure of the influence of ideas.
Next the section discusses data that we have collected to measure citation rates and spillovers.
The section concludes with descriptive tables that characterize and compare academic and
industrial science. Section 3 presents graphs and descriptive tables of the citation rates and
spillovers. The discussion considers flows of basic research to firms that derive from

1

Geographic restrictions on idea flows lie beyond the limits of this paper. Keller (2002) reviews the literature of
international R&D spillovers and analyzes intra- and inter-industry aspects of the spillovers. Peri (2005) studies
resistance to patent citation imposed by region, country, language, and distance. Adams (2002) discusses and
provides estimates of localization of knowledge spillovers within countries.

universities and from other firms. The section concludes with Herfindahl indexes of
concentration of the spillovers. The explanation of scientific output at the industry and field
levels is the topic of Section 4. Output is expressed as a function of industry research, academic
spillovers, and industrial spillovers. Regression analysis is then undertaken using a panel of
industries, science fields, and years. The equations estimate elasticities of scientific output with
respect to industry research as well as the R&D spillovers. A final table tests for equality of the
elasticities. Section 5 concludes.

2. Citation Rates and R&D Spillovers
2.1. Concepts
The analysis relies on papers and citations made by industrial researchers in firms and on
R&D stocks of cited firms and universities. Since we are interested in industry and field effects
we assign citing papers to the primary industry of the employer. This is the industry of largest
sales in Compustat, our source for industrial R&D. We assign cited papers to the primary
industry of employers when a firm is cited and to the academic sector if a university is cited.
Papers are assigned to the scientific field of the journal where they appear. Since citations link
citing and cited papers together, they are able to measure influence only among active
researchers.
In this paper we report two citation-based statistics. First, we report mean citation rates
averaged by industry, field, and year. In the underlying data individual citation rates are
numbers of citations made by papers in a specific citing firm, field, and year, to papers in
specific cited firms or universities, fields, and years, divided by the number of papers in the cited
group. The mean citation rate is the simple average of the individual rates by industry, field, and
year. By analogy with search theory, the mean rate is the average propensity to draw on

4

knowledge stocks of cited institutions. As we have seen, citations require sufficient human
capital and emphasis on science in firms for publication to occur. Besides this, scientifically
driven citations assume sufficient relevance of cited research to make it worthwhile to learn
about the research of others.
However, as a spillover measure, citation rates have several shortcomings. While they
capture the propensity to cite, this is contingent on citations having occurred. Also, the citation
rate fails to capture frequency so the same mean rate can apply once, twice, or a thousand times.
And finally, the citation rate does not consider the scale of the cited knowledge stock.
The aggregate R&D spillover gets around many of these shortcomings. This is the sum
of citation rates by citing industry, field and year multiplied by stocks of R&D in the cited group.
Zero citation rates diminish the spillover and are implicitly taken into account through the
frequency of citation events. The product of the citation rates times the cited R&D stocks
incorporates size of the cited knowledge stock. In this way the aggregate R&D spillover answers
several objections to the mean citation rate.
As a proxy for underlying knowledge, R&D stocks have some advantages. For a start,
they provide an historical record of research. This activity goes beyond patents or papers, since
learning from past research effort could be important whether it is published or not. And besides
R&D stocks capture size of effort in anticipation of future impact and are likely to be correlated
with that impact. R&D gets around nominal shifts in the patent-R&D ratio, a problem that
afflicts citation stocks. The ratio could decline due to a shift towards more important inventions.
If so R&D would remain profitable despite the fall in the patent-R&D ratio (Lanjouw and
Schankerman, 2004). Also, in science the basic research stock is a forecast by granting agencies
of future impact of the research. While these arguments in favor of R&D stocks are not perfect,

5

they help to explain why R&D might perform better in this role than patent counts (Scherer,
1982a). We turn now to definitions of the citation rate and the aggregate R&D spillover.
The individual citation rates in this paper are defined by citing and cited institutions,
fields, and years. Citing institutions are firms; cited institutions are firms or universities. Notice
that classification into industries is immediate from the primary industries of firms.
The raw citation rate is c klf g y g f d yd / n lf d yd . Superscript k stands for the citing firm while l
stands for the cited university or firm. Subscripts f g and y g indicate citing field and year; f d
and y d indicate cited field and year. The numerator c klf g y g f d yd counts citations made by
firm k papers in citing field and year f g and y g to university or firm l papers in cited field and
year f d and y d . This is divided by n lf d yd , the total number of papers in firm or university l in f d
and y d that could in principle be cited.
The mean citation rate U is defined over sets of citing and cited institutions, fields, and
years:

(c klf g y g f d y d / nlf d y d )

The term N is the number of raw citation rates. Examples of the set of institutions are firms in
the same industry and firms not in the same industry. Examples of the set of fields are fields that
are the same and fields that are not the same, and so on. Equation (1) is the average propensity
to cite, given the definitions of citing and citing institutions, fields, and years.
The aggregate R&D spillover from universities to firms is the sum,

This is the sum of individual citation rates times academic R&D stocks R lf d , y d 1 in cited
university l and field f d lagged one year yd  1 . The definition is again flexible; it covers
observations where firms in a specific industry and field cite universities in a specific field, and
so forth.
The source for university R&D is the CASPAR database (National Science Foundation,
various years). We use CASPAR to construct individual R&D stocks by university, field, and
year. In turn we use the stocks and citation rates to construct R&D spillovers from universities
to specific firms and fields. The university data have two advantages over Compustat, our
source for firm R&D. University R&D is available by field over a dependably long period of
time. Second, and consistent with our interest in basic knowledge flows university research
concerns science rather than general R&D.
Compustat records total R&D expense by a firm. It makes no distinction between basic
research and applied research and development; and within basic research it makes no distinction
among sciences. To obtain a rough estimate of the aggregate R&D spillover from industry under
these constraints, we make two adjustments. Since we lack R&D by cited field we use the
citation rate from a citing firm and field to a cited firm averaged over cited fields. In addition we
multiply the total stock of R&D in the cited firm by the ratio of basic research expenditure to
total R&D in its primary industry, since our interest is in basic research. The basic-total research
ratio is about 0.05 in the industries that we study. The aggregate R&D spillover from firms is
therefore:

The bar placed over the citation rate indicates the average over cited fields. Besides this b j is the
basic research ratio in the primary industry j of the cited firm, and R yl d 1 is the total R&D stock
of the cited firm. For example, suppose that engineering papers in firm X, located in
communications services, cite papers of firm Y, located in software and business services.
Then c XY
/ nYyd is the average citation rate by engineering papers in X to papers in Y averaged
f g y g yd
across cited fields, R Yj,1 is the lagged stock of R&D in Y, and b j is the ratio of basic research to
total R&D in software and business services. Equation (3) represents our best measure of the
spillover from other firms, though the fact that we cannot individually measure basic research in
cited fields inevitably introduces errors in the spillover.
Finally, the lagged basic research stock R K , y d 1 of industry K is

2.2. Data Sources
The data consist of 230 thousand papers written in the top 200 U.S. R&D firms in 1998 as
ranked by their R&D, and 2.43 million papers of the top 110 U.S. universities. The papers were
published during 1981-1999. The top 200 firms make about one million citations to papers of
top 110 universities as well as 600 thousand citations to papers of top 200 firms, including
themselves. We remove self citations from a firm to itself from the data.
The source for the papers and citations data is ISI, the Institute for Scientific Information, in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Papers appear in more than 7,000 journals. Each journal is
assigned to one science field. The main alternative to this method is to assign papers according
to authors’ departmental affiliations. But this strategy fails because information on authors’

8

departments is incomplete2.

The database is described in Adams, Black, Clemmons, and

Stephan (2005) and in Adams, Clemmons, and Stephan (2004, and forthcoming).
For the university R&D stocks in the academic R&D spillover (see (2)) we use research
expenditures by university, field, and year from the CASPAR database (National Science
Foundation, various years). We express expenditures in millions of dollars, deflate using the
implicit GDP deflator (1992=1.0), and accumulate the research stocks over the previous eight
years using a depreciation rate of 0.15. For the firm R&D stocks in the industrial R&D spillover
(see (3)) we use total R&D expense in Compustat (McGraw-Hill, various years). We express
R&D expense in millions of 1992 dollars and calculate an R&D stock over the previous eight
years using a depreciation rate of 15 percent. We employ published data on the ratio of basic to
total research by industry from 1985-1999 from National Science Foundation (Research and
Development in Industry, various years) and multiply this times firms’ R&D stocks in each
industry to calculate an indicator of the firm’s stock of basic research as this enters the spillover
(3). The industry stock of basic research (4) is this indicator summed over firms in the same
industry.
To undertake the regression analysis of Section 4 we extract a three-dimensional panel from
the data. The panel consists of 11 industry groups, up to six main sciences, and up to 12 years
ranging from 1988-1999. The industry groups, which include the top 200 R&D firms according
to their primary industry in Compustat, are as follows: petrochemicals (petroleum refining,
chemicals excluding drugs and biotechnology, rubber, and plastics); drugs and biotechnology;
metals (primary and fabricated); machinery (except computers); computers; electrical equipment;

To explore this alternative we assigned all papers of Harvard University to one of the science fields in our data
using address information. About a third of the papers could not be assigned; this caused us to abandon the address
assignment method.

9

instruments; communications services; software and business services; miscellaneous
(agriculture, food & tobacco, furniture, paper, miscellaneous manufacturing, and retail and
wholesale trade). Clearly the industry groups extend well beyond manufacturing.
We have seen that the firm’s primary industry is its industry of largest sales. It is not the
firm’s only industry, since large corporations usually span multiple industries. In work using
plants owned by chemical firms in the Longitudinal Establishment Database of the U.S. Bureau
of the Census, it has been shown that the plants cut across a large number of industries (Adams
and Jaffe, 1996; Adams, 1999). Since this is the norm rather than the exception for large firms,
the fact that companies exceed the bounds of a single industry may explain why industry is a
weak barrier to basic research flows in the empirical work below.
Sciences included in the panel are biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering,
medicine, and physics. These six fields account for nearly all papers in industry. The time
period is 1988-1999. Starting the panel in 1988 allows for a build-up of R&D spillovers and
R&D stocks as described in equations (1)-(4). The regression panel includes the dependent
variable—numbers of scientific papers written in an industry, field, and year; and independent
variables consisting of industry, field, and year fixed effects, the university and industry
spillovers, and industry R&D stock.
Table I reports the distribution of industrial papers by field and compares this with the
distribution of academic papers. Distributions for the 11 industry groups form the rows;
distributions for the entire industrial and academic sectors appear as the bottom two rows.
Columns report total papers in an industry and sector and percentages of the papers in the six
science fields. For the top three sciences in an industry we highlight the data and issue ranks in
parentheses. Drugs and biotechnology publishes the most scientific papers, but petrochemicals,

10

electrical equipment, transportation equipment, telecommunications services, and software and
business services also publish in large amounts. Science publication is notably scarce in metals,
machinery, and in miscellaneous agriculture and manufacturing.
Within drugs and biotechnology, biology, medicine, and chemistry rank first, second, and
third. But this ranking is not representative of industry. Among industries biology is a top three
field only in drugs and biotechnology, and petrochemicals. Medicine is in the top three only in
drugs and biotechnology and instruments. In contrast engineering ranks in the top three in every
industry except drugs and biotechnology with physics and chemistry nearly as prevalent. This
shows up in the second to last row, which reports the science distribution for all industries.
Engineering and physics tie for first; biology ranks third; and chemistry ranks fourth. The
academic distribution differs considerably from this: biology and medicine account for 68
percent of papers. This simply reflects differences in the comparative shares of the scientific
workforce in the two sectors. Engineers, physicists, and chemists dominate industrial papers
while life scientists dominate academic papers. However, this difference is surely an
understatement, because many industrial researchers, and especially engineers, do not publish or
cite3.
Industry and field could both restrict basic research flows. To this end, Table II examines
differences in citation rates and R&D spillovers within and between fields and industries.
Within field, between field, and total dimensions are reported in columns. Rows contain citation
statistics arranged by industry. Across columns, citation rates are higher within fields than
between them. In addition 72 percent of the academic spillover and 60 percent of the industrial

3

See Stephan, Sumell, Black, and Adams (2004), Table 2 for a description of the placement of PhD students to
firms during the years 1997-1999. Forty-nine percent were in engineering, 11 percent were in chemistry, seven
percent were in computer science, and six percent were in physics: thus 73 percent overall were in natural science.
Only 10 percent were in biology and medicine.

11

spillover occur within fields. Citation rates to other firms are higher than to universities,
possibly because industrial papers are more similar and more relevant than academic papers.
Citation occurs at almost the same rate between industries than within them, but R&D spillovers
between industries account for 64 percent of the total. These differences in sources of spillovers
suggest that field may obstruct flows of basic research to a larger extent than industry. It is
noteworthy as well, that academic spillovers are twice as large as industrial spillovers. This gap
would be even larger if the citation rate to industrial science were not the higher of the two.

3. Descriptive Findings
3.1. Interactions with Universities
This section describes the industry and field structure of the citation statistics. To
visualize this structure we rely on three-dimensional column graphs. In graphs of this kind,
discontinuous dimensions (industry and field) map into a continuous variable (citation statistics).
For convenience we abridge the 11 industries in Table I to six. We do so by forming three
aggregates: metals, machinery, and miscellaneous agriculture and manufacturing; computers,
communications, and software; and electrical equipment and instruments. The results for firmuniversity interactions are shown in Figures I and II.
Figure I shows high rates of citation to computer science, intermediate rates to chemistry,
engineering, and physics; and low citation rates to biology and medicine. But as we have seen,
citation rates do not capture frequency or the size of cited R&D. Figure II, which we rotate
slightly in a clockwise direction, shows how important this distinction is. It shows that the
structure of academic spillovers is completely different from the structure of citation rates in
Figure I. The citation rate to computer science is high, but its spillover is low because of a low
frequency of citation rate events and a small R&D stock. Figure II shows that R&D spillovers of

12

biology and medicine are huge in drugs and biotechnology despite the fact that citation rates to
biology and medicine are low. There is thus only a weak correlation between citation rates and
spillovers. Finally note the cluster of secondary peaks of academic spillovers from computer
science, engineering, and physics, to computers, etc. and electrical equipment, etc.
Table III takes a close look at the university-industry spillover structure. It shows the top
four academic spillovers by industry and by citing and cited field. Besides the spike of
biological and medical spillovers as well as their near-confinement to drugs, etc., the table
uncovers spikes in petrochemicals, electrical equipment, transportation equipment,
communications services, and software and business services. Table III indicates that 39 of the
44 top spillovers occur in the same field, showing in a different way the importance of field as a
limiting factor in basic research flows.

3.2. Interactions with Other Firms
We undertook a similar exercise for citation rates and spillovers from other firms. Figure
III, which is again rotated slightly, shows citation rates by citing industry and cited industrial
field. Compared with Figure I overall rates are higher and more nearly equal across fields and
industries. Figure IV presents aggregate R&D spillovers from other firms. Not surprisingly,
compared to Figure II, industrial spillovers are less dominated by biology and medicine.
Another aspect of Figure IV is the significant cluster of industrial spillovers in computers, etc.
and in electrical equipment, etc.
Figures V and VI study interactions among industries. Figure V presents interindustry
citation rates. Citation rates to science-intensive industries—petrochemicals, drugs, etc.,
computers, etc., and electrical equipment, etc.—are low compared with citation rates to metals,

13

machinery, and miscellaneous, a group that does little in the way science4. But Figure VI shows
that spillovers from metals, etc. are quite small compared with other industries. This again
reflects on the deficiencies of the citation rate as a spillover indicator. In Figure VI spillovers
from drugs, etc., show up almost entirely in petrochemicals and drugs. In contrast spillovers
from petrochemicals are flat but widely dispersed. This is also true of spillovers from computers
etc.
Like Table III, Table IV shows the top six industrial R&D spillovers by citing and cited
industry and field. As one would expect this list is dominated by chemistry, physics, and
engineering, with biology and medicine present mostly in petrochemicals and drugs. Withinfield spillovers account for 54 of the top 72 spillovers. This is a smaller proportion than in Table
III and suggests that industrial science is more applied, eclectic, and interdisciplinary than
academic science.

3.3. Concentration of R&D Spillovers
While the figures and tables are helpful in visualizing particular spikes and clusters in
aggregate R&D spillovers it would helpful to quantify concentration of R&D spillovers to
industries. To this end we calculate Herfindahl indexes of concentration based on shares of
R&D spillovers to each industry. To begin with, we compute a field cited index for recipient
industry K :
(5)

H KF

f FdK

s 2fK ,

Smaller bodies of knowledge could readily exhibit higher citation rates. To see why assume that citations to
different sciences yield a marginal benefit that diminishes at a similar rate with respect to search over articles and
assume that the constant marginal cost of making a citation is similar across sciences. Given these assumptions the
equilibrium citation rate to smaller literatures will be higher than to larger ones. Of course, if the marginal cost is
higher for more technical papers then it would follow that small but highly technical literatures would exhibit lower
citation rates.

14

We calculate (5) for both academic and industrial spillovers. Here FdK stands for the set of fields
that K cites and s fK is the share of field f in spillovers to K . Since there are six fields the lower
bound on (5) occurs when all shares equal 1/6|0.17. Squaring and summing the shares, (5) also
equals 0.17.
In the case of industrial spillovers we define an industries cited index for citing industry K :
H KI

(6)

¦

jI dK

s 2jK

Here I dK is the set of industries that K cites; s iK is the share of industry i in spillovers to K . The
lower bound occurs when all shares equal 1/11|0.09. Squaring and summing the shares, (6) also
equals 0.09.
Table V displays the results. Rows indicate citing industry; columns indicate the Herfindahl
indexes. The first two columns use the field-cited index H KF as defined in (5). Drugs, etc. and
machinery, etc. are the two most concentrated industries. In drugs most spillovers derive from
biology and medicine. In machinery most spillovers derive from chemistry and physics. The
third column reports the Herfindahl index H KI (6) of spillovers among cited industries. The two
most concentrated industries are drugs, etc., and communications services. Firms in these
industries receive most of their spillovers from the same or a nearby industry. This is partly
because of their fields of specialization: biology and medicine are concentrated in drugs and
petrochemicals, and computer science, engineering, and physics are concentrated in
communications services and electrical equipment.

4. Explaining Scientific Output in Industries and Fields
Section 3 has described citation statistics and it has mapped points of origin and destination
of basic research flows within the U.S. economy. The rest of the empirical work tries to explain

15

the output of scientific papers using the stock of basic research in an industry, academic and
industrial spillovers, and fixed effects. We estimate the following knowledge production
function, expressed in logarithms:
(7)

ln( papersijt ) D 0  D tc Dt  D Ic D I  D cD F  E R ln( Rit )  E A ln(S A,ijt ) 

E ZA [ Z A u ln(S A,ijt )]  E I ln(S I ,ijt )  E ZI [ Z I u ln(S I ,ijt )]  u ijt

Terms entering (7) are
papers ijt —number of scientific papers (or citation-weighted papers) written in

industry i and field j at time t
Dt , DI , DF —vectors of year, industry, and field fixed effects
Ri ,t 1 —stock of basic research in industry i at time t  1
S Aijt , S Iijt —spillovers of basic research from academia and industry (plus 0.001)

to industry i and field j at time t

Z A —dummy indicator equal to 1 when S Aijt >0 and 0 otherwise
Z I —dummy indicator equal to 1 when S Iijt >0 and 0 otherwise
u ijt —normally distributed error term

Since we fit the logarithm of papers on the logarithms of the R&D indicators, the E coefficients
are elasticities. Also, we add 0.001 to each spillover in order to take logarithms when it is zero.
For this reason we introduce interaction terms involving Z A and Z I times the logarithms of the
spillovers. As we shall see the interaction terms handle cases where the spillover is zero.
We estimate (7) on the panel data set discussed in Section 2. This is arranged according to
industry, field, and year to address the industry and field relationships of interest. After missing
values are excluded the data include 747 observations. We vary (7) by dropping fixed effects, by

16

dropping interaction terms, by varying the sample, and by switching between papers and
citation-weighted papers. Table VI contains basic specifications. Throughout, the regressions
report robust standard errors5. Notice as well that we tag key variables with their E coefficients
for tests of equality restrictions among coefficients later on.
Equations VI.1 to VI.3 omit fixed effects. VI.1 fits a simple regression of the logarithm of
scientific papers on the logarithm of the industry’s basic research stock. This elasticity is
positive and highly significant. VI.2 adds logarithms of the academic and industrial research
spillovers to VI.1. This increases R2 from 0.35 to 0.87 but causes a sharp drop in the elasticity of
industry basic research. The industry stock is however, a crude proxy for past basic research,
and this may result in a downward bias when spillovers are included. The spillover elasticities
are positive and highly significant; the academic spillover has more than three times the effect of
the industrial spillover. To capture zero spillovers VI.3 adds the zero interaction terms that we
have discussed. As expected, coefficients of the interaction terms are negative and roughly
cancel the main spillover coefficients. Or to see this in a different light, the spillover has no
effect when it is zero, since in that event both the main and interaction terms differ from zero.
VI.4 and VI.5 add fixed effects to VI.2 and VI.3, and these are now within group regressions.
The R&D coefficients remain significant and do not change systematically. The elasticity of
industry basic research increases, but the industrial spillover elasticity decreases.
The rest of the table consists of variations on VI.5. VI.6 drops drugs, etc. The reason is this.
The figures and descriptive tables show that spillovers in drugs and biotechnology exceed other
spillovers, so this industry could have an undue influence on the results. But in fact the

. The

exclusion has little effect and the elasticities stay about the same. VI.7 drops metals, machinery,
and miscellaneous from the sample. Since these three industries produce little science, they are
also outliers. Apart from a slight decline in the industry basic research elasticity and a rise in the
elasticity of academic spillovers, the results stay about the same. In VI.8 and VI.9 the dependent
variable consists of citation-weighted papers. Since these are five-year “forward” citations in an
industry and field, the data are missing in 1996-1999 and this causes a large drop in sample size.
Equation VI.8 repeats VI.3 using citation-weighted papers, omitting fixed effects. R&D
elasticities are higher in VI.8, suggesting that the effect of R&D is partly to produce higher
impact research. Equation VI.9 repeats VI.5 including fixed effects. The elasticity of the
industry research stock turns negative: evidently its effect cannot be identified separately from
industry, field, and year. The spillover elasticities remain positive and significant.
Table VII introduces decompositions of the academic and industrial spillovers. We begin
with a few preliminaries. Since the table separates spillovers into within and between
components, we introduce zero interaction terms for each one. As before elasticities of the
interaction terms are negative and cancel main spillover elasticities. Thus spillover components
have no effect when they are equal to zero. Also, the different spillover decompositions have
little effect on the elasticity of industry research, which stays around 0.20. Notice that we tag
key variables with corresponding J coefficients for later tests of equality restrictions. All the
equations use VI.5 as the baseline specification.
Henceforth we focus on the R&D spillovers. VII.1 decomposes these into within and
between field components. Not surprisingly main elasticities are positive, interaction elasticities
are negative, and both are usually significant. The within field component consists of spillovers
where citing and cited fields are the same. The between field component consists of spillovers

18

where citing and cited fields differ. If within field research is more relevant, its elasticity would
be the larger of the two. This is what VII.1 finds: the within field academic elasticity is 0.38,
about twice the between field elasticity (0.18). The within field industrial elasticity is 0.15 and is
about 40 percent larger than the between field elasticity (0.11).
In VII.2 we maintain the within- and between- field distinction for academic spillovers, but
we separate the industrial spillover into within- and between- industry components. As before,
the within industry component consists of spillovers where citing and cited industries are the
same and the between industry component consists of spillovers where this is not true. If basic
research within the same industry is more relevant, then the within elasticity should exceed the
between elasticity. However, VII.2 rejects this hypothesis. It finds that the between industry
elasticity is 0.15, larger than the within elasticity (0.12).
VII.3 considers a four component breakdown of the industrial spillover. In this equation we
consider both within- and between- field and industry dimensions. Making due allowance for
collinearity, VII.3 tells a similar story to VII.1 and VII.2. The within field, within industry
elasticity is 0.10 and the within field, between industry elasticity is 0.09. The two are almost the
same, suggesting that industry has little effect on flows of basic research. The between field,
within industry elasticity is 0.01 and the between field, between industry elasticity is 0.09, on
average falling short of the within field estimates. VII.3 confirms the importance of the within
field component as an impediment to the impact of basic research on scientific output, and it
denies any corresponding role for industry.
Table VIII tests for equality of the elasticities of the R&D indicators in selected regressions
from Tables VI and VII. Using regressions VI.3 and VI.5 the table tests for equality of the
elasticities of the industry basic research stock and the two spillovers. Where E R is the elasticity

19

of the industry basic research stock and E A is the elasticity of the academic basic research
spillover, Test 1 decisively rejects the hypothesis of equality, finding that the academic elasticity
is significantly larger than that of industry basic research. Likewise Test 2 checks for and
rejects, equality of E A and E I . Therefore, the academic spillover elasticity significantly exceeds
the industry elasticity.
Tests 3 to 11 apply to Table VII. Test 3 tests for and rejects equality of the elasticities of the
academic, within and between field spillovers in regressions VII.1-VII.3. Test 4 tests for and
rejects equality of the within field, academic and industrial spillover elasticities. Test 5 accepts
equality of the between field, academic and industrial spillover elasticities. Therefore, the
academic spillover elasticity is significantly greater than the industrial spillover within fields, but
not between fields. This strongly suggests that the stronger influence of universities occurs
within fields, and equally strongly it reflects the more eclectic nature of industry research.
Consistent with this hypothesis, test 6 accepts equality of within and between field industrial
spillover elasticities. Test 7 applies to VII.2 and accepts equality of within and between industry
elasticities of the industrial spillover. This confirms, more formally, that spillovers from the same
industry do not differ in their effect from spillovers outside the industry. Remaining tests apply
to VII.3. Test 8 rejects equality of the within and between field, within industry elasticities,
implying that the within field elasticity is larger. Test 9 accepts equality of elasticities within
and between fields and between industries. Tests 10 and 11 accept equality of the elasticities
within and between industries.

20

The tests yield five statements about the effect of basic research flows on the production of
industrial science. Following (7), recall that the effects are elasticities6. The five statements are:
(1), the academic spillover has a larger effect than either industry basic research or the industrial
spillover; (2), within fields, the academic spillover effect exceeds the industrial spillover effect;
(3), within fields, effects tend to be larger than between fields, so that field is a resistance factor
in the production function for science; (4), within industries, effects are the same as between
industries, so that industry is not a resistance factor; and (5), the within field effect of the
industrial spillover occurs within the industry.
Besides (7) we carried out nonlinear least squares (NLLS) regressions in the style of
Griliches (1986), which allows for arithmetic comparisons of an extra million dollars of different
spillover components rather than one percent changes as in (7). We illustrate this approach by
reporting estimates of a knowledge production function that, like VII.1, includes within and
between field effects:

The equation includes fixed effects for year, industry, and field. Its nonlinearity is clear from the
coefficients for the between field components of the spillovers, which lie inside the logarithms.
The coefficients are less than 1.0. This difference is marginally significant for academic

spillovers. The estimates suggest that an extra million dollars of between-field academic and
industrial spillovers is 60-70 percent of their within-field counterparts.

5. Concluding Discussion
This paper provides new evidence on the transmission of basic research through the U.S.
economy. As indicators of basic research flows this paper distinguishes strongly between
citation rates and aggregate R&D spillovers. Though the citation rate gets at the propensity to
draw from a particular body of knowledge, it does so contingent on the existence of citation.
Furthermore, it takes no account of the frequency of citation events, nor does it consider the size
of cited knowledge stocks. To illustrate, the citation rate to academic computer science is
exceptionally high. But the frequency of citation events to computer science is low, as is its
R&D stock. This principle becomes clear from repeated study of the descriptive figures and
tables. Besides this, the descriptive materials indicate points of origin and destination for the
academic and industrial spillovers.
Likewise we investigate the role of industry basic research and R&D spillovers in the
production of scientific knowledge as evidenced by papers. While it is not easy at all times to
disentangle the industry stock from fixed effects, in general we find that the industry stock as
well the academic and industrial spillover contribute to scientific output. Of the three R&D
inputs academic spillovers have the largest effect, measured by the elasticity of papers with
respect to the input. However, there is reason to think that errors in the industry basic research
stock lead to downward biases in its effect.
Besides the study of total spillovers we decompose the spillovers into within and between
field components for academic and industrial spillovers, and into within and between industry
components for industrial spillovers. In brief, we find that within field effects on scientific

22

output exceed between field effects, but that within and between industry effects are statistically
indistinguishable. Thus field seems to be a barrier to flows of basic research in a way that
industry is not.
Throughout this paper has relied on scientific papers and citations to these papers to gauge
science’s influence in industry. This is a reasonable strategy for assessing the influence of
science on research output, which is the use to which we put it in this paper. But the broader
question perhaps is that of the role of flows of human capital as well as scientific research in the
productivity of final goods and services. That question must await the development of
comprehensive data on stocks and flows of scientists and engineers and their human capital
attributes.
