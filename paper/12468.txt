Fraternity Membership and Binge Drinking

NBER Working Paper No. 12468

JEL No. I12
ABSTRACT
This paper examines the relationship between membership in social fraternities and sororities and
binge drinking among 18–24 year old full-time four-year college students who participated in the
1995 National College Health Risk Behavior Survey. To deal with unobserved heterogeneity in
binge drinking incidence and frequency regressions, I enter as explanatory variables various
measures of situational and overall alcohol use. When these are added, the fraternity membership
coefficient is substantially reduced in size, but remains large and highly significant. This suggests
that fraternity membership increases binge drinking. If not, it identifies a very specific mechanism
underlying the decision to join a fraternity: members drink more intensely than non-members even
while doing so in similar frequencies and situations and for similar lengths of time. Particularly
notable is that behavior by underage students appears to drive the relationship.

1. Introduction
Social fraternities and sororities play a prominent role in the lives of students at many
colleges and universities. Over 18 percent of 18–24 year old full-time, four year college students
sampled by the 1995 National College Health Risk Behavior Survey (NCHRBS) were fraternity
members, while slightly more than 12 percent of 17–25 year old four year college students
surveyed by the 2001 Harvard College Alcohol Study reported fraternity membership.1
Although fraternities serve a variety of functions, the predominant activity with which they are
associated is the consumption of alcohol.
Fraternities often connote a culture of heavy drinking, as famously portrayed in the movie
Animal House. Anecdotal evidence of problematic drinking at fraternity events abounds.
Objective data confirm that fraternity members drink more heavily than do non-members. In the
NCHRBS, for instance, the rate of binge drinking, i.e. consuming at least five alcoholic
beverages within a few hours, at least once in the past month was 69 percent among fraternity
members and 42 percent among non-members. Academic studies using data from the Harvard
College Alcohol Study (Chaloupka and Wechsler, 1996) and the Core Alcohol and Drug Survey
(Alva, 1998 and Cashin et al., 1998) have documented that fraternity and sorority members drink
more frequently and heavily than their non-member peers.
It is tempting to conclude from this descriptive evidence that fraternity membership itself
is the reason that fraternity members drink more excessively than do non-members. But does
fraternity membership truly cause heavy drinking? More specifically, would the incidence or
frequency of drunkenness among students who join fraternities decline in the absence of
fraternities? That is the question on which this study seeks to provide information.

1

Throughout the paper, the term “fraternity” is meant to apply more generally to sororities as well as fraternities.

1

It is probable that students who join fraternities do so at least in part because they like to
drink heavily and perceive that fraternity membership will facilitate such behavior by grouping
them with other students who share these preferences. For example, Sacerdote (2001) found that
among the Dartmouth College senior classes of 1997 and 1998, students who drank in high
school were more likely to join a fraternity than those who did not. Baer et al. (1995), Schall et
al. (1992) and Wechsler et al. (1996) obtain similar evidence, and also report that among students
who drank in high school, those who joined fraternities were more likely to have been heavy
drinkers than moderate drinkers.
In the extreme, imagine that self-selection of heavy drinkers into fraternities is the sole
mechanism underlying the correlation between drinking and fraternity membership, and that
heavy-drinking students would ultimately socialize together even if fraternities did not exist.
Under this scenario, heavier drinking among fraternity members could not be attributed to
membership, i.e. eliminating fraternities would not reduce heavy drinking among students who
would have otherwise joined fraternities.
Contradicting this hypothesis, Borsari and Carey (1999) outline three ways in which
fraternity membership might directly increase heavy drinking. One is by providing social
pressure to drink heavily in order to gain acceptance and avoid social ostracism among fellow
members who are observed to engage in heavy drinking. Another is by elevating perceptions of
peer drinking norms, which already tend to be overestimated by the typical college student. The
third is by providing a physical environment that is conducive to heaving drinking because of the
ready availability of alcohol and insulation from students who are less tolerant of excessive
drinking.

2

Some evidence suggests that fraternity membership does indeed directly increase heavy
drinking. Lo and Globetti (1995) find that students who do not binge drink upon college entry
are three times more likely to start binge drinking if they join a fraternity. Also, Sher et al.
(2001) estimate that fraternity members drank more heavily than non-members during college,
even controlling for previous alcohol use, but that drinking behavior no longer differed across
membership status three years after college.
This study addresses the question of whether fraternity membership causes binge
drinking using a fairly straightforward and non-technical proxy variable approach. Specifically,
it includes a set of potentially endogenous variables as explanatory factors to control for
unmeasured determinants of binge drinking that might be correlated with fraternity membership.
The unique aspect of the paper is that the main proxy variables are measures of alcohol use,
including but not constrained to binge drinking, during the current period. The analysis thus
identifies the effect of fraternity membership on binge drinking using differences between
members and non-members who consume alcohol, not categorized with respect to intensity, in
identical frequencies and situations.
Because it is impossible to determine if proxy variables completely control for the
spurious correlation linking two endogenous variables, it would be overly ambitious to state the
goal of the study as providing a precise estimate of the causal effect of fraternity membership on
binge drinking. In this case, however, the current alcohol use measures specified as proxies
explicitly control for the exact type of unobserved heterogeneity that is expected to contaminate
the relationship of interest. Moreover, this approach attributes a sizable portion of the observed
variation in binge drinking to non-binge alcohol use rather than fraternity membership, even
though the latter might directly influence non-binge as well as binge drinking.

3

Thus, the analysis prospectively provides a conservative estimate of the causal effect of
fraternity membership on binge drinking. At the very least, it isolates a component of the
correlation between fraternity membership and binge drinking that is arguably non-causal, and
outlines the selection mechanisms that would have to prevail to invalidate the interpretation of
the remaining correlation as a causal effect. Namely, for the identified effect to not be causal,
two conditions must hold: fraternity membership must not directly influence non-binge alcohol
consumption, and students who join fraternities must do so because they binge drink more often
than other students who otherwise consume alcohol with the same frequency, in the same
situations and over the same period of time.
The concern about binge drinking among college students is the many potential harmful
effects it can have on others. These include physical and psychological damage from drunken
driving, physical violence, vandalism, and forced or risky sexual activity. Even reduced
educational attainment or academic performance is a legitimate concern, if we believe that the
knowledge obtained from schooling conveys a positive social benefit. The efforts that will most
effectively limit external effects of college student binge drinking depend in part on whether
fraternities play a causal role in such drinking.

2. Data and Empirical Strategy
This analysis aims to estimate the effect of social fraternity and sorority membership on
binge drinking among college students. The main econometric issue that must be surmounted is
the expected presence of unobserved factors that simultaneously determine fraternity
membership and binge drinking. In particular, fraternity members likely engage in binge
drinking with greater likelihood or frequency than non-members at least in part precisely because

4

their preferences for binge drinking led them to join a fraternity. If so, some of the excess
drinking among fraternity members relative to non-members would still be observed even in the
absence of fraternities. The goal of the analysis is to address this omitted variable problem, upon
which it can be established how much of the initial correlation between fraternity membership
and binge drinking remains and whether this remaining correlation is statistically and
economically significant.2
The empirical strategy is to include proxies for the specific type of unobserved
heterogeneity that is expected to bias the estimated relationship between binge drinking and
fraternity membership. Ideally, controls for binge drinking preferences could be included to
break the spurious correlation between fraternity membership and binge drinking that exists
separately from any causal relationship running from membership to drinking. The approach
pursued here is to include observable factors that closely approximate the omitted preference
measures.
What makes this analysis distinctive is the use of several measures of current alcohol use
to reflect unobserved tastes for drinking that might influence both fraternity membership status
and current binge drinking. Current drinking, defined without regard to categorization as
binging, i.e. that includes both binge and non-binge drinking episodes, is clearly related to the
same underlying preferences that determine binge drinking. Simply controlling for current
drinking status, however, leaves open the possibility that the remaining correlation between
fraternity membership and binge drinking simply represents a scenario in which members gain

2

I consider the endogeneity problem to be solely due to omitted variables. One could conceivably also admit the
possibility of reverse causation, i.e. that binge drinking causes fraternity membership. I dismiss this mechanism
because it implies that variations in current binge drinking directly lead to changes in fraternity membership status.
The latter rarely changes for a student except for when the student joins a fraternity, and binge drinking clearly
depends on unobserved preferences. A complete accounting for unobserved heterogeneity, therefore, would seem to
eliminate the potential for reverse causation.

5

more utility from binge drinking than do non-members who are also drinkers. To address this
concern, measures of drinking frequency and duration as well as the incidence of drinking in
various circumstances that are particularly risky are included. Any self-selection that persists
would have to be quite specific, in that it would involve binge drinking differences between
members and non-members who shared the same frequencies and durations of drinking as well
as propensities to drink in several extreme situations. Moreover, this strategy could yield
conservative estimates of fraternity membership effects on binge drinking, because non-binge
alcohol consumption could also be a function of fraternity membership.
These drinking preference proxies are included on top of a baseline model that controls
for many standard individual characteristics and are ultimately accompanied by other proxies for
omitted factors that are not directly related to alcohol use. The vector of controls can therefore
be divided into four groups: an indicator for fraternity membership (F), a set of variables that are
plausibly exogenous with respect to unobserved determinants of binge drinking (X), a set of
alcohol use measures intended to represent omitted factors that influence both fraternity
membership and binge drinking (A), and a set of additional non-drinking covariates that are
included for the same reason as the alcohol use measures (U). A regression equation that
summarizes this empirical approach is

Variants of equation (1) are estimated using data from the National College Health Risk
Behavior Survey (NCHRBS), which was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) and administered during the first half of 1995. As described in CDC (1997),

6

the purpose of the NCHRBS was to monitor a broad range of health-risk behaviors among
college students. A two-stage cluster sample design was used to produce a nationally
representative sample of undergraduate students aged 18 and over. In the first stage, 74 fouryear institutions and 74 two-year institutions were selected, with probability proportional to
undergraduate enrollment size, from 16 strata formed based on the relative percentage of black
and Hispanic students. The second stage consisted of a random sample of undergraduates in the
136 participating institutions, with targets of 56 students from four-year schools and 72 students
from two-year schools. Of the 8,810 students selected, 7,442 were deemed eligible and 4,838
completed the questionnaire, which was sent by mail to students for self-administration.
Responses were voluntary and confidential.
The sample for this analysis is restricted to undergraduate students who were 18–24 years
old when their interviews occurred. As of the survey period, 57 percent of the 12 million
students enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities were ages 18–24, and one quarter of U.S.
residents in this age range were full- or part-time college students. The analysis sample also
includes only full-time students from four-year schools. These restrictions are made because the
excluded group of students who are older, part-time or at two-year schools contains very few
fraternity members. Sensitivity analyses, however, are conducted to verify that these sample
exclusion criteria do not drive the estimation results.
The two dependent variables in the regressions are constructed from information on the
number of days in the past 30 days on which the respondent engaged in binge drinking, i.e.
consumed at least five alcoholic beverages in the span of a few hours. One is an indicator that
any binge drinking occurred, regressions of which are estimated using a probit model. Rather

7

than probit coefficients, the tables report the average marginal effect for sample respondents, as
opposed to the marginal effect at the average explanatory variable values.
The other dependent variable is a measure of binge drinking days. The survey reports
only categorical information, with choices of 0, 1, 2, 3–5, 6–9, 10–19, and 20 or more.
Consequently, this variable is analyzed using an interval regression model. This method handles
the lower bound of zero, and top interval upper bound of 30, identically to a Tobit model. The
interval model departs from the Tobit, however, by recognizing that while values of 1 and 2
represent exact numbers of days, all that is known about observations with values in the
remaining three categories are the lowest and highest possible number of days that the value
could represent.
Like the probit and Tobit models, the interval model is estimated using maximum
likelihood. Rewriting equation (1) as B = Z + , the likelihood function is

The key explanatory variable in the regressions, F, indicates whether or not the student
reports being a member of a social fraternity or sorority. This does not incorporate information
on whether the student resides in a fraternity or sorority house. Only 58 of the 260 fraternity
members in the analysis sample, i.e. 22 percent, also live in a fraternity house.
The vector X of exogenous drinking determinants includes a set of indicators that control
for gender, age, grade level, race, marital status, parental education and school. An indicator is
included for females, each age from 19–24 (age 18 omitted), the sophomore, junior and senior
classes (freshmen omitted), non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, Asians and other non-white, nonHispanics (non-Hispanic whites omitted), married and separated, divorced or widowed (never
married omitted), each parent not finishing high school, graduating from high school, having
some college and graduating from college (“not sure” omitted), and for each institution
represented except one. The school fixed effects are not strictly exogenous, but are potentially
important to include as controls for student selection into schools on the basis of drinking
prevalence and fraternity presence.
As described above, the vector A consists of five alcohol use measures that are intended
to proxy for unobserved tastes for alcohol that might simultaneously influence fraternity
membership and binge drinking. Three of these correspond to the past 30 day period, including
the number of days alcohol was consumed and the number of times alcohol was consumed
before driving and in combination with illegal drugs. All three measures are collapsed from
categorical responses by assigning midpoints and top-codes. Possible choices were zero, 1–2, 3–
5, 6–9, 10–19, 20–29, and 30 for drinking days, zero, 1, 2–3, 4–5, and 6 or more for drunk
driving, and 0, 1–2, 3–9, 10–19, 20–39, and 40 or more for use with drugs. Top-codes of 6.4 for
drunk driving (three percent of the sample) and 40 (0.1 percent) are specified, assuming that

9

positive values have an approximate normal distribution (as is done for all top-codes) and
rounding to the nearest tenth.
The other two alcohol use proxies are an indicator of whether alcohol or drugs were used
before the most recent episode of sexual intercourse, and the number of years since alcohol was
first consumed. The latter is formed by subtracting from respondent age the response to a
question asking the age at which the respondent first had a drink of alcohol other than a few sips.
Choices for the latter question were never, 12 or younger, 13–14, 15–16, 17–18, 19–20, and 21–
24. This was converted to a single variable equaling respondent age for those who had never
consumed alcohol (forcing the resulting years variable to equal zero), 19 year olds reporting 19–
20, and 21 year olds reporting 21–24; 12 for those reporting the youngest category (12 percent of
the sample); interval midpoints for all reporting 13–14, 15–16 and 17–18, 20 year olds reporting
19–20 and 24 year olds reporting 21–24; 21.5 for 22 year olds reporting 21–24; and 22 for 23
year olds reporting 21–24. The latter two assignments represent the midpoint between the lower
bound age of 21 and the age of the respondent.
Alcohol consumption frequency and duration are intended to directly reflect preferences
for drinking. The drinking before sex variable is motivated by the finding in Cashin et al. (1998)
that fraternity members are more likely than non-members to view drinking as a vehicle for
sexual opportunity. Cashin et al. (1998) also show that fraternity members are more likely than
non-members to experience negative consequences from the use of alcohol and other drugs,
while Williams et al. (2004) find that alcohol and marijuana are economic complements among
college students. Meanwhile, if fraternities are primarily non-residential and serve as a location
at which members are likely to consume alcohol, fraternity members might have more
opportunities to drink and drive regardless of any effect that membership has on binge drinking.

10

To reiterate, the central assertion of the study is that these five alcohol use variables
control for much of the unobserved heterogeneity that might contaminate the estimated effect of
fraternity membership on binge drinking. With these alcohol consumption measures included,
the effect of fraternity membership is identified by comparing members and non-members who
have consumed alcohol for the same length of time and, in the past 30 days, drank on
approximately the same number of days, drove and used an illegal drug while drinking about the
same number of times, and had the same drinking status the last time they had sex. If this effect
is not entirely causal, self-selection into fraternities must occur on the basis of very specific
tastes for binge drinking relative to more moderate drinking. One could alternatively argue that
the regressions over-control for drinking that might truly be caused by fraternity membership, so
that the estimated effect on binging is conservative.
Finally, the vector U includes several other covariates that can potentially control for
unobserved heterogeneity in the relationship between fraternity membership and binge drinking.
To separate the effect of the fraternity environment from that specifically attributable to
membership, a set of indicators reflect whether respondents live in a residence hall, fraternity or
sorority house, other institutional housing, off-campus residence, or parent or guardian’s home,
with “other” as the omitted category. Because working might have both substitution and income
effects on fraternity activity and drinking, a variable representing the number of weekly hours
the respondent works for pay is constructed from choices of zero, 1–9, 10–19, 20–29, 30–39, 40,
and more than 40, using interval midpoints and a top code of 45. The number of sports teams on
which the respondent played (intra- or extramural), with a top-code of 3.3 assigned for the “3 or
more” category, and height each might proxy for popularity (Persico et al., 2004), which could

11

influence both membership and drinking. The same is true for bodyweight, which also helps
determine the amount of alcohol necessary to cause inebriation.
Two additional controls are included in the U vector. The number of cigarettes smoked
in the past 30 days, formed by multiplying days smoked and the number smoked per day, proxies
for time preference (Fersterer and Winter-Ebmer, 2003). The days variable is analogous to that
for alcohol, while midpoints and a top-code of 21 are assigned for cigarettes per day categories
of zero, less than one, one, 2–5, 6–10, 11–20, and more than 20. Finally, the number of times
marijuana was used in the past 30 days accounts for the potential interrelationship between
alcohol and marijuana for college students, as cited above (Williams et al., 2004). This is
recoded, using a top-code of 41, from a variable with the same categories as the alcohol and drug
combination variable.
The sample size for the analysis is 1,404, from 66 different schools representing between
four to 48 respondents. This includes only respondents for whom all variables listed above are
observed. Regressions are estimated using NCHRBS sampling weights. To verify robustness,
however, models that also include additional respondents for whom the only missing information
pertains to a U variable and that are unweighted are also estimated. Standard errors are adjusted
to be robust to arbitrary forms of heteroskedasticity.3
Weighted sample means are provided in table 1. Column 1 shows unconditional means,
while columns 2 and 3 show means, respectively, for fraternity members, who comprise 18
percent of the sample, and non-members. Nearly half of respondents binge drank at least once in
the past 30 days. Combined with the binge days mean of 2.5, this implies that students who
binge drank did so an average of more than five of the past 30 days. As expected, binge drinking
3

The precise notation for equation (2), therefore, would have each term multiplied by a weight variable, and add a
subscript to 2 signifying that it can vary across observations.

12

is much more prevalent and frequent among fraternity members than non-members. Among
drinkers, fraternity members binge drank an average of 6.7 days compared to 4.8 days for nonmembers. Fraternity members are more likely than non-members to be male, in the middle of
the age distribution, juniors and seniors, white, and unmarried, and to have mothers who attended
college and fathers who graduated from college. Overall and situational alcohol use is also much
more common among fraternity members. Fraternity housing appears to crowd out primarily off
campus housing rather than dormitories. Compared with non-members, fraternity members
work fewer hours in paid jobs, are taller and heavier, play on more sports teams, and use
cigarettes and marijuana more often.

3. Results
a. Baseline estimates
Results for baseline models that do not control for alcohol use or other heterogeneity
proxies are shown in table 2. Columns 1 and 4 indicate large and highly significant bivariate
relationships between fraternity membership and past 30 day binge drinking, with implied semielasticities at the dependent variable means of .56 for any binge drinking and .83 for days of
binge drinking. Adding exogenous personal characteristics in columns 2 and 5 has only a small
mediating effect on the fraternity coefficient sizes, which are reduced by 18 percent for any
binge drinking and 22 percent for binge drinking days. Moreover, in contrast to the presumption
that school fixed effects would absorb some of the self-selection of heavy drinkers into
fraternities, fraternity coefficients increase slightly when school indicators are added in columns
3 and 6. These estimates predict that, in the previous 30 days compared to non-members,
fraternity members are more likely to binge drink by 23 percentage points (i.e. 47 percent), and

13

binge drink on 1.7 additional days (i.e. 67 percent). Out of hand, these seem too large to reflect
purely causal effects, thus warranting the insertion in subsequent models of the previously
described controls for unobserved confounders.
Columns 2 and 3 also show the coefficients of the included exogenous variables, other
than the school indicators. Binge drinking is more common among males, whites and the
unmarried, but not significantly related to age, grade level, or parental education.

b. Adding alcohol use covariates
Tables 3 and 4 present results for models that include alcohol use covariates to account
for self-selection of students into fraternities based on drinking preferences. The dependent
variable is the binge drinking indicator in table 3 and the number of binge drinking days in table
4. For both, the starting point is the specification in columns 3 and 6 of table 2, i.e. with all
exogenous factors including school indicators on the right hand side. Columns 1–5 add to this a
single alcohol use variable, while column 6 inserts all five of the alcohol use variables at once.
For both forms of the dependent variable, each alcohol use measure enters highly
significantly and reduces the size of the fraternity membership coefficient. The covariate that
has the largest quantitative impact by far is days of drinking in the past 30 days, which enters in
column 1. Adding drinking days as an explanatory factor reduces the fraternity membership
coefficient by 60 percent in table 3 and 72 percent in table 4. In terms of the pseudo R-squared,
i.e. the ratio of the model and constant-only log likelihoods subtracted from one, the drinking
days variable explains an additional 31 percent of the total variation in binge drinking propensity
and 25 percent of the variation in frequency. Six more days of consuming alcohol, which is

14

slightly less than the standard deviation of 6.2, predicts binge drinking increases of 31 percentage
points in the probability of occurrence and nearly two days.
Importantly, however, the effect of fraternity membership remains highly significant.
This is partly because the additional explanatory power of days drinking reduces the standard
errors of the estimates by lowering the regression standard errors (i.e. increasing the pseudo Rsquared). This is especially noticeable in table 4, in which the nearly three-quarters reduction in
coefficient size is accompanied by a t statistic decline of only 45 percent.
Drinking and driving (column 4) is the next most important alcohol use behavior in terms
of both the partial R-squared and the reduction in magnitude of the fraternity coefficient.
Drinking before sex (column 5) follows in importance, having a larger impact in table 3 than in
table 4 perhaps because, as an indicator, it better explains binge drinking occurrence than
frequency. While years since first consuming alcohol (column 2) has the largest t-statistic in
table 3, and in partial R-squared terms its contribution is more important than that of using
alcohol with drugs (column 3) and comparable to that of drinking before sex, it has the smallest
impact on the fraternity coefficient. Years of drinking also has the largest predetermined
component of the alcohol covariates. Fraternity involvement can bring about drinking initiation
only for students who did not drink until entering college, but 58 percent of respondents first
drank by age 16 and another 22 percent did so at age 17 or 18. The relative lack of influence of
years since first drinking on the fraternity coefficient could therefore signal that fraternity
membership directly affects the other alcohol measures. Net of further omitted factors, this
suggests that a model including all of these measures might yield a conservative estimate of the
effect of fraternity membership on binge drinking.

15

Estimates for the model just described are given in column 6. Even when included
simultaneously, all five alcohol covariates are highly significant with the exception of using
alcohol with drugs in table 4, which is marginally significant. But comparing the fraternity
coefficients and partial R-squareds in columns 1 and 6 reveals that the other alcohol use
measures have little further impact once drinking days is held constant. In table 3, the fraternity
coefficient actually grows when the other four drinking measures are added, while in table 4,
over 98 percent of reduction in coefficient size from table 2 is attributable simply to including
the drinking days variable.
The column 6 estimates imply that joining a fraternity or sorority will increase the
probability of past 30 day binge drinking by just under 10 percentage points and days of binge
drinking in the past 30 days by slightly less than one-half. The associated semi-elasticities of
around 0.2 are much more plausible causal effect sizes than are those in table 2.
Does this mean that these coefficients indeed represent causal effects of fraternity
membership? Their large t statistics, even while holding constant various forms of alcohol use
that are highly correlated with binge drinking, suggests that they might be. This is particularly
true given that the main fraternity coefficient mediator is days of any drinking over the same
period as the binge drinking measures that serve as response variables. It is hard to imagine that
alcohol consumption frequency is completely predetermined and not at all influenced by
fraternity membership. Even if this were true, for the fraternity coefficient to reflect merely
spurious correlation in this context, selection would have to simultaneously occur on binge
drinking but be essentially unrelated to the length of time since alcohol initiation and three
specific drinking behaviors that are also highly correlated with binge drinking. This scenario
seems somewhat convoluted as a full explanation of the fraternity membership effect.

16

Yet the pseudo R-squareds, though large by cross sectional data standards, are
sufficiently small to leave unexplained a substantial portion of the variation in binge drinking.
Combined with the reality that it is impossible to know for sure if other types of unobserved
heterogeneity are present, the case for causality can never be unquestioningly made. But this
concern can be addressed at least partially by weighing evidence regarding the presence of
additional unmeasured confounding factors.

c. Adding other unobserved heterogeneity proxies
To further investigate the causality issue, tables 5 (any binge drinking) and 6 (binge
drinking days) add other controls for self-selection into fraternity membership. The format is
identical to that of tables 3 and 4, i.e. columns 1–6 insert single sets of variables on their own
while column 7 includes the entire group of additional variables at once.
The only new heterogeneity proxy that is a meaningful mediator of the fraternity
membership effect is the number of sports teams on which the respondent played during the
school year, which consistently enters with a t-statistic of slightly above 4. Students with greater
sports involvement are heavier drinkers: an additional sports team raises the likelihood of binge
drinking by just under 10 percent and binge days by nearly eight percent. Moreover, when
appearing without the other new selection controls, the sports variable reduces the fraternity
membership coefficient by 13 percent in the propensity equation and 17 percent in the frequency
equation, relative to the specifications in column 6 of tables 3 and 4. This would seemingly
provide evidence against the argument that binge drinking-related self-selection into fraternities
is fully accounted for by holding constant other measures of alcohol use.

17

Several other aspects of tables 5 and 6, however, support a causal interpretation of the
fraternity effect. None of the other additional factors are close to reaching significance except
cigarette smoking, which is marginally insignificant in explaining any binge drinking and
actually raises the fraternity coefficient in both tables. Since smoking and binge drinking are
positively related, the partial correlation of smoking with fraternity membership must be
negative. If variation in smoking behavior truly reflects differences in time preference, then
contrary to expectations, fraternity members discount the future slightly less than do nonmembers. Also, once all the variables listed in tables 5 and 6 are included along with sports
involvement, the coefficient on fraternity membership falls by only 6–7 percent. Further,
playing on sports teams could be a mechanism through which fraternity membership indirectly
influences binge drinking, given that fraternities are often represented in intramural leagues and
having a fraternity-based team might turn sports competitions into binge drinking occasions.4
Still, even in column 7 of each table, the fraternity coefficient falls despite only very
small increases in the pseudo R-squared relative to the models in the final columns of tables 3
and 4. In pseudo R-squared terms, the fraction of variation in binge drinking that remains
unexplained is close to one-half in the probit model and almost two-thirds in the interval model.
This implies that there is scope for other sources of spurious correlation between fraternity
membership and binge drinking. To further investigate, tables 9 and 10 below present estimates
for samples stratified on the covariates listed in tables 3–6.

4

Unfortunately, there is no information regarding whether the teams represented by the sports variable are
intercollegiate or intramural.

18

d. Other sample permutations
Before that, table 7 explores the sensitivity of the fraternity membership effect under
various permutations to the sample inclusion criteria. These and remaining models employ the
specification from column 6 of tables 3 and 4. The additional heterogeneity proxies from tables
5 and 6 are omitted for several reasons. Because the already small sample necessarily shrinks
substantially when it is split along various dimensions in tables 8–10, parsimony is desirable.
Also, as already argued, the estimated effects might be conservative even without the additional
mediators if fraternity membership in reality causes more frequent non-binge drinking, and this
leads to more binge drinking. Plus, as mentioned above, fraternity membership might increase
binge drinking through its effect on sports participation, the only variable in the additional set
which has a tangible impact on the fraternity coefficient when included.
The overall theme of table 7, in which each row represents a different model, is that the
previously estimated fraternity membership effects are robust to a wide array of changes to the
sample. The coefficients for any binge drinking, in column 2, are particularly stable, as they
never deviate by more than five percent from the baseline of 0.96. The estimates for binge
drinking days fluctuate somewhat more, yet are never different from the baseline of .448 by
more than 15 percent.
The smallest coefficients are in row A., which simply re-estimates the main model
without using sample weights. For binge days, removing the roughly one-third of respondents at
schools with sample fraternity membership of less than 10 percent (row I.) has a similar impact.
Incorporating the 157 respondents who are 25–34 years old (row C.) has a comparable effect in
the opposite direction. A similar coefficient is obtained in the days regression when the 74
respondents who have complete information on all variables except those listed in tables 5 and 6

19

are included. Fraternity effects are smaller when students who have attended school for more
years than their class standing would predict are excluded, larger when currently and formerly
married students are excluded, and largely unchanged when part-time or two-year college
students are included or schools with no sample fraternity members (which does not necessarily
imply that the school has no fraternities) are excluded. The latter is unsurprising after observing
earlier that selection on schools is unimportant. Significance remains high in all models, with t
statistics of nearly 3 or above in all cases.

e. Stratifying on exogenous factors
The final three tables present results for samples that are stratified along a number of
different dimensions. In table 8, five separate exercises are conducted in which the main sample
is divided into two distinct sub-samples based on values of an exogenous factor that until now
has served as an explanatory variable. Panel A. shows that fraternity membership effects are
more than twice as large for males as for females. This could be a function of males binge
drinking more often or (male) fraternity activities being more focused on drinking than those of
sororities. Regardless, coefficients for both measures of binge drinking remain significant for
females despite their smaller magnitudes.
Panel B. divides the sample into respondents who are at least 21 years old and thus able
to drink legally, and those who are no more than 20 years old and therefore underage. The
fraternity coefficients are somewhat larger for the younger group than for the sample as a whole,
by around 10 percent for binge days and over one-third for any binge drinking, but are quite
small and highly insignificant for the older group. This is one of the more noteworthy results of
the analysis. Students who can legally drink presumably face fewer barriers to obtaining alcohol

20

by means other than fraternities than do underage students. Consequently, the heterogeneity in
effects by age suggests that the easier access to alcohol provided by fraternities is an important
avenue through which fraternities increase binge drinking.
The results in panel C. support this hypothesis, in the sense that the distinction between
the younger and older classes is less stark, particularly for binge days, than that between the
underage and legal age. Still, the parallel between the estimates in B. and C. might provide
evidence in support of the other two reasons offered by Borsari and Carey (1999) to explain how
fraternities increase binge drinking. Social pressure to drink heavily could be more intense for
new pledges who want to fit in than for students who have belonged to a fraternity for several
years and are more liable to have leadership roles. Similarly, observed drinking activity at
fraternity events might inflate peer drinking norms less as students acquire experience in various
campus social settings and thereby have opportunities to gain a more representative perspective
about drinking behavior at their schools.
Panel D. of table 8 makes apparent that binge drinking is more responsive to fraternity
membership for whites than non-whites, particularly in terms of frequency. Taken together, the
results from panels A., B. and D. imply that the impact of fraternity membership on binge
drinking is particularly problematic for underage white males. In contrast, panel E. indicates that
parental education has little to do with fraternity affiliation-related differences in binge drinking.

f. Stratifying on alcohol use
Table 9 again shows several pairs of estimates derived from splitting the sample into two,
this time based on values of the alcohol use covariates. This is a further check on whether the
fraternity effect is attributable to self-selection of heavy drinkers into fraternities. Consider two

21

groups consisting of respondents with low and high values of a particular drinking measure. If
selection on that variable is important, a substantial component of the relationship between
fraternity membership and binge drinking should be explained by changes from below average to
above average rates of both membership and binging when moving from one group to the other.
The expectation in that case is for coefficients in both corresponding sub-samples to be relatively
small compared with those from the full sample.
If this expectation is correct, then from the table 9 results it remains difficult to argue that
self-selection is a predominant reason for the significant and large fraternity membership
coefficients. To begin with, panel A. divides the sample based on whether alcohol was
consumed on at least three occasions in the past 30 days. The fraternity effect on any binging in
the infrequent drinking group is about 50 percent larger than in the combined sample, casting
serious doubt on an explanation in which unobserved tastes for drinking play a key role. At the
same time, the analogous coefficient is smaller, but still sizable and significant, for frequent
drinkers, among whom fraternity membership has an effect on binge days that is again roughly
50 percent larger than in the full sample.
Panels B. and C. split the sample into groups of more and less experienced drinkers,
based first on age when alcohol was first consumed (B.) and then on years since that event (C.).
In both, among less experienced drinkers fraternity coefficients remain highly significant; they
are smaller than in the baseline models, but only slightly so for any binge drinking. For more
experienced drinkers, the effect of fraternity membership on any binge drinking is akin to the
main estimate when the distinction is according to age at first drink, and slightly smaller than
that for less experienced drinkers but still significant when categorization is according to years

22

since first drink. But in each case, the impact on binge days is close to 50 percent larger than
originally.
Panel D. reveals that engaging in drunken driving over the past 30 days might be a
marker for students among whom fraternity membership has particularly strong effects on heavy
drinking. For these students, who make up slightly less than 30 percent of the sample,
coefficients are nearly three times as large as in the primary specification, indicating that
fraternity affiliates are 28 percentage points (35 percent) more likely to binge and do so on 1.25
(24 percent) more days than non-members. Analogous effects are considerably smaller among
students who did not drive while drinking, but are still significant for the prevalence of binging
and indicate binge drinking increases of non-trivial size, i.e. 17 percent for incidence and 11
percent for days.
Panels E. and F. separate students who did and did not use illegal drugs with alcohol in
the past 30 days and drink before the last time they had sex, respectively. Few students
combined drugs or sex with alcohol. Consequently, results for the samples containing students
who did not engage in the corresponding activity are similar to those from the whole sample,
with coefficients slightly larger in the any binging models and smaller in the binge days models.
The dual samples in each case are too small for estimating the probit regressions, which drop
observations that are perfect predictors of the outcome. However, for the few students who did
use drugs or have sex while drinking, the fraternity coefficients in the binge frequency models
are of comparable size to that for students who drove while drinking. Again, particularly for
these three groups of students but also to a lesser extent for more frequent and experienced
drinkers, if these behaviors drive the link between fraternity membership and binge drinking, the

23

coefficients for these groups should be much smaller, not much larger, than those prevailing for
the full sample.

g. Stratifying on other endogenous variables
Finally, table 10 shows estimates for samples stratified on the unobserved heterogeneity
proxies listed in tables 5 and 6, even though these are not included as explanatory factors in the
regressions starting with table 7. The results for specifications A.–D. are similar to those for
many of the table 9 models. Coefficients are larger than in the full sample regressions for
cigarette and marijuana smokers and the tall and heavy, groups that were candidates to have
greater likelihood of fraternity membership and binge drinking for spurious reasons. In each of
these cases, coefficients are considerably smaller in the residually defined groups, yet are still
practically large and statistically significant. In specification E., fraternity effects are smaller,
but still important, for those who live on campus even though binge drinking prevalence higher,
i.e. 54 percent compared to 43 percent for those living off campus.
Panel F. indicates that the relationship between fraternity membership and binge drinking
is substantially different for students who do and do not work. One hypothesis is that nonworking students are simply more likely to join fraternities (20.5 percent versus 16.4 percent for
working students) and binge drink, particularly with regards to drinking frequency. However, as
fraternity membership and its effect on the probability of binge drinking are still sizable among
non-workers, and fraternity effects are quite large among workers, it seems unlikely that this sort
of selection mechanism drives the relationship.
A much bigger disparity in fraternity membership exists between students who did not
play a sport (13.1 percent) and those who did (27.5 percent). Again, though, the pattern of

24

results makes it difficult to argue that this is a manifestation of an important selection mechanism
that is responsible for the association between fraternity affiliation and binging. Even among
those not participating in sports, the effect of fraternities on whether binge drinking took place is
over three-quarters of that in the baseline model and highly significant. Conversely, though not
quite significant at standard levels in the small sample of sports participants, the effect on binge
drinking frequency is over three-quarters of that in the baseline model. An alternative
explanation, given the prevalence of fraternity-affiliated intramural sports teams, is that sports
participation is a mechanism through which fraternity membership leads to binge drinking.

4. Conclusion
Using data on 18–24 year old full-time four-year college students who participated in the
1995 National College Health Risk Behavior Survey, this study examined the relationship
between binge drinking and membership in social fraternities and sororities. The primary
contribution was to enter various measures of situational and overall alcohol use as explanatory
variables in binge drinking regressions. This directly addresses the specific type of unobserved
heterogeneity expected to inflate the estimated effect of fraternity membership on binge
drinking, i.e. that students who like to drink heavily are precisely the ones who choose to join
fraternities. Indeed, including these alcohol use covariates substantially reduces fraternity
membership coefficients. But the continued significance of these coefficients in both the
statistical and economic sense support the hypothesis that fraternity membership increases binge
drinking.
Again, the main caveat is that the alcohol use explanatory variables and other unobserved
heterogeneity proxies do not necessarily fully control for endogenous self-selection into

25

fraternities. Thus it is impossible to argue with absolute certainty that the fraternity membership
coefficient represents a causal effect. At a minimum, however, a very idiosyncratic selection
mechanism must prevail for these results to be consistent with the absence of a causal effect. In
particular, fraternity members must drink more intensely than non-members, yet consume
alcohol in similar frequencies and situations and for similar lengths of time. Moreover, an
instrumental variables method, which is infeasible with these data, would suffer from analogous
uncertainties regarding the correlation between the instruments and unobservable determinants of
binge drinking.
Also, the analysis does not attempt to correct for measurement error. This could bias
estimates up if binging is over-reported by fraternity members or under-reported by nonmembers. In contrast, if random, measurement error would impart downward bias in the
magnitude of the estimated effect.
From a social perspective, the fraternity membership coefficient is an underestimate of
the total effect of fraternities on binge drinking, because it fails to account for effects on drinking
by non-members. For instance, holding constant fraternity membership status, Chaloupka and
Wechsler (1996) find that the presence of a fraternity on campus increases the likelihood that a
student binge drinks, while Glindemann and Geller (2003) estimate that levels of intoxication are
higher at fraternity parties than at other parties.
The positive impact of fraternity membership on binge drinking suggests targeting
campus alcohol education efforts towards fraternity members. The earlier outlined psychosocial
explanations for causal fraternity effects on drinking suggest that fraternity-wide rather than
individual sanctions for drinking-related violations, efforts to lower peer drinking norms among
fraternity members, and vigilant monitoring of fraternity-house activities might help reduce

26

binge drinking on campus and its external effects. Particular focus should be placed on underage
fraternity members, as they are largely responsible for the observed relationship between
membership and binge drinking.
Also, Sacerdote (2001) found that peer effects among roommates and fellow dormitory
residents are a major determinant of whether Dartmouth students joined a fraternity. Combined
with the conclusion of this study, the implication is that fraternity membership is an indirect way
through which peers influence binge drinking. Assigning incoming freshmen who are
particularly likely to join fraternities, based on observable characteristics, to the same rooms and
dorms might be a way to limit fraternity membership and thus binge drinking.
A problem with this strategy is that increased drinking is only one of many potential
effects of fraternity membership, some of which might be positive. Hunt and Rentz (1994)
report that fraternity membership provides a sense of security and trust that comes from
belonging to a group and identifying with others in the community, which might lead to
advantageous outcomes. De Los Reyes and Rich (2003) propose that fraternity members are
more involved in campus life and more likely as alumni to maintain connections to their alma
mater than are non-members. Indeed, Harrison et al. (1995) found that schools with greater
participation in fraternities and sororities had higher rates of alumni giving. Further, Marmaros
and Sacerdote (2002) found that among the Dartmouth senior class of 2001, fraternity members
and students networking with fraternity members were more likely to obtain a high paying job.
More generally, fraternity membership is important for lifelong friendships that could ultimately
impact various outcomes (Sacerdote, 2001). Thus, it is important to stress that a large leap
would be required to conclude, merely on the basis of a link between fraternity membership and
binge drinking, that fraternities should be banned or even limited in any way.
