The Tradeoff between Mortgage Prepayments and Tax-Deferred Retirement Savings
Gene Amromin, Jennifer Huang and Clemens Sialm
NBER Working Paper No. 12502
August 2006

ABSTRACT

We show that a significant number of households can perform a tax arbitrage by cutting back on their
additional mortgage payments and increasing their contributions to tax-deferred accounts (TDA).
Using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, we show that about 38% of U.S. households that
are accelerating their mortgage payments instead of saving in tax-deferred accounts are making the
wrong choice. For these households, reallocating their savings can yield a mean benefit of 11 to 17
cents per dollar, depending on the choice of investment assets in the TDA. In the aggregate, these
mis-allocated savings are costing U.S. households as much as 1.5 billion dollars per year. Finally,
we show empirically that this inefficient behavior is unlikely to be driven by liquidity considerations
and that self-reported debt aversion and risk aversion variables explain to some extent the preference
for paying off debt obligations early and hence the propensity to forgo our proposed tax arbitrage.

Introduction

Many households are reluctant to participate in financial markets either as lenders or
as borrowers. According to the 2001 Survey of Consumer Finances, nearly half of U.S.
households do not own stocks and more than one third of the households eligible for
employer-sponsored retirement plans do not contribute at all to such plans. Furthermore,
some households are also reluctant to carry debt. At a first glance, this runs counter to
stylized facts on the proliferation of consumer borrowing, especially in unsecured credit
markets. Yet, a surprising number of households accelerate paydowns of their mortgage
loans, which account for a much bigger share of their debt. We show that these choices
generate substantial monetary costs for a significant number of households.
This paper focuses on two of the most important financial decisions of households:
retirement savings and home-ownership borrowing. Many households, at one time or
another, face the trade-off between paying an extra dollar off the remaining mortgage
on their house and saving that extra dollar in tax-qualified retirement accounts. In
a world without frictions, paying off mortgage loans early and investing in retirement
accounts would be equivalent saving decisions. In reality, however, taxes and transaction
costs play a key role in the determination of the effective borrowing and lending rates.
We show that, under certain conditions, it becomes a tax-arbitrage to reduce mortgage
prepayments and to increase contributions to tax-deferred accounts (TDA).1
Mortgage interest payments are deductible from taxable income for households that
1
Throughout the paper, we use the term “mortgage prepayment” to denote extra payments on an
existing mortgage or taking out a mortgage with a maturity shorter than the standard 30 years. Short
maturity mortgages carry higher periodic payments, which can be considered committed “prepayments”
in the same sense as writing extra checks to the mortgage company. We do not include mortgage
refinancing in our definition of “prepayments,” although this interpretation is common in the industry.

itemize their deductions, while investment income in retirement accounts remains effectively tax-exempt.2 Hence, households earn pre-tax returns (rL ) in their retirement
accounts and pay after-tax rates (1 − τ )rB on their mortgage borrowing. Although the
borrowing rate (rB ) on the mortgage is likely higher than the investment rate (rL ) for
an asset with similar risk properties, we show that, as long as rL > (1−τ ) rB , households
are generally better off saving in a TDA instead of prepaying their mortgage. Given the
simplicity of this strategy, it is reasonable to ask whether and to what extent households
recognize this tradeoff in their personal decisions.
Using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, we investigate household choices
between mortgage prepayments and retirement account contributions. While it is not
surprising that some households are not making the right choice, the magnitude of the
overall inefficiency is striking. On the margin, 38% of households who prepay their mortgages could benefit from our proposed arbitrage strategy. Depending on the choice of
the investment asset in the TDA, the mean gain from such a reallocation ranges between
11 and 17 cents per dollar of “mis-allocated savings.” In the aggregate, correcting this
inefficient behavior could save U.S. households as much as 1.5 billion dollars per year.
The finding that a significant number of households make substantial mistakes in their
financial decisions echoes the conclusions of Campbell (2006).
Although there are numerous potential rational reasons for agents either to prepay
the mortgage or not to contribute to their retirement accounts–among them interest rate
risks, liquidity and default risks, credit constraints, and fixed costs of participation–we
show that, given the nature of the tax arbitrage, those reasons are unlikely to explain
simultaneously why households prepay and do not contribute. Hence, it is difficult
to identify rational reasons for the inefficient behavior of forgoing the substantial tax
benefit.
2
Consider, for example, a Roth account where households pay income tax when they contribute and
no more tax is owed upon withdrawal. Also, when tax rates are constant over time, investing in a
401(k) account is equivalent to investing in a Roth account.

2

Rather, these households seem to be influenced by an aversion to take on debt. Empirically, debt aversion and risk aversion explain to some extent the household preference
for reducing their debt obligations in spite of incurring considerable monetary losses in
the process. The propensity of debt-averse households to forgo such tax arbitrages is
related to the findings in Graham (2000), who shows that many corporations forgo
substantial tax benefits by holding too little debt.
Our paper is most closely related to the recent literature on the optimal asset location
choice which considers the tradeoff between savings in taxable vs. tax-deferred accounts.
Dammon, Spatt, and Zhang (2004), Shoven and Sialm (2004), Poterba, Shoven, and
Sialm (2004), Huang (2005), and Garlappi and Huang (2006) show theoretically that,
in order to maximize the tax benefit of retirement accounts, highly-taxed assets should
generally be located in tax-deferred accounts and that lightly-taxed assets should be
located in taxable accounts. The actual behavior of individuals investing in taxable
and tax-deferred accounts is analyzed by Bodie and Crane (1997), Barber and Odean
(2003), Bergstresser and Poterba (2004), and Amromin (2004). These papers find that
many households have significant amounts of money in both accounts and that a large
proportion of them do not appear to take advantage of the potential benefits of optimal
asset location. Similar to this literature, we theoretically compare the tax efficiency of
two forms of savings choices, and then document actual household behavior and evaluate
the extent of losses relative to the theoretical benchmark. Our main contribution is to
introduce mortgage payments as an additional investment option in the tax arbitrage
framework. There is also a vast literature on both the retirement savings decisions3 and
their mortgage choices4 . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to link these
3

For example, Benartzi and Thaler (2001), Madrian and Shea (2001), Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and
Metrick (2002), Cunningham and Engelhardt (2002), Agnew, Balduzzi, and Sunden (2003), Duflo and
Saez (2003), Choi, Laibson, and Madrian (2004, 2005), Mitchell, Utkus, and Yang (2005), Duflo, Gale,
Liebman, Orszag, and Saez (2006), Huberman and Jiang (2006), and Brown, Liang, and Weisbenner
(2006) consider the determinants of individual TDA participation and portfolio choice.

mortgage choices including type of contract, refinancing, and prepayment decisions.

two strands of research by considering retirement contributions and mortgage payments
as two alternative forms of household savings decisions.
Our finding is also consistent with the explanation that households may not treat
these two forms of saving decisions as substitutes. Hoynes and McFadden (1997) find
little substitution between retirement savings and other forms of personal financial asset
saving and housing wealth, and Poterba, Venti and Wise (1995) find that even similar
saving vehicles like 401(k)s and IRAs are not close substitutes.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the tax-arbitrage strategy in
detail and Section 3 discusses the robustness of the tax arbitrage strategy. Section 4
describes the data and Section 5 provides summary statistics for TDA contribution and
mortgage payment behavior. Section 6 calculates the cost of choosing the wrong saving
strategy. Section 7 looks at possible explanations for why households may forgo the tax
arbitrage and Section 8 concludes.

Tax Arbitrage Strategy

This section describes the tax arbitrage strategy between tax-deferred retirement account contributions and mortgage prepayments. We consider a household whose TDA
contributions are less than the statutory maximum and who at the same time makes
additional mortgage payments. Households that make additional mortgage payments
have effectively chosen to save some of their income through a specific savings channel. We analyze the marginal trade-off between contributing to a TDA and building
up home equity to determine whether these households would be better off reallocating
their savings.
There exist several different types of retirement accounts. Because of data limitations, we restrict our attention to traditional employer-sponsored TDAs, such as 401(k)
and 403(b) plans which allow contributions on a before-tax basis. These contributions

4

grow tax-deferred until withdrawal when the household pays taxes both on its original
contribution amount and the cumulative investment returns.
The household is assumed to have a constant tax rate τ over time, and faces a penalty
κt on TDA withdrawals at time t. Currently, withdrawals by individuals younger than
59 12 years of age generally face a 10% penalty. Hence, κt = 10% if t < 59 12 and κt = 0
otherwise.
To derive our main result, we make the following simplifying assumptions. First, the
household has a fixed-rate mortgage with a rate rB and earns a constant rate of return rL
on its tax-deferred savings. Second, the household itemizes deductions and can therefore
effectively subtract mortgage interest from taxable income. Third, the mortgage has a
fixed remaining horizon T , which means that the household never defaults or pays off the
entire mortgage for moving or refinancing purposes. Fourth, each dollar of prepayment
in the current year affects only year T cash flow and reduces the after-tax mortgage
payment by $(1 + (1 − τ )rB )T . These assumptions are useful for illustrating the tax
arbitrage strategy. We discuss their robustness in Section 3.
Under these assumptions, we propose a simple tax arbitrage strategy where the
household makes the following perturbation to its current savings strategy: (i) decreases
the mortgage prepayment by one dollar; (ii) contributes an additional
1

dollars to the tax-deferred account which earns a return of rL ; (iii) receives an immediate
tax credit of τ X dollars for the additional contribution; and (iv) withdraws X(1 + rL )T
dollars from the tax-deferred account in year T .
Since the additional contribution X to the tax-deferred account grows to X(1 + rL )T
by the end of year T , exactly offsetting the withdrawal amount, the new strategy yields
the same wealth in the tax-deferred account as the current strategy. Moreover, the total
proceeds from the withdrawal are X(1+rL )T (1−τ −κT ) = (1+(1−τ )rB )T ,where τ is the
5

tax rate and κT is the penalty upon withdrawal.5 At the same time, we have assumed
that reducing the current mortgage prepayment by one dollar increases the mortgage
obligation by (1 + (1 − τ )rB )T dollars in year T . Hence, the withdrawal proceeds exactly
offset the additional mortgage liability due to the reduced prepayment of the mortgage
loan. Finally, the combination of steps (i)-(iv) implies that the household can walk
away with a net profit of 1 + τ X − X in the taxable account, which can be consumed
immediately. We simplify its expression and term it the “Marginal Arbitrage Profit”
(MAP),

.

(2)

For any household, as long as the MAP measure is positive, it is better off following
the arbitrage strategy of reducing its prepayment and increasing its TDA contributions.
Inspection of equation (2) yields the following intuitive results. First, the arbitrage
profit decreases with rB and increases with rL . A higher mortgage borrowing rate rB
makes it less profitable to stop prepaying, while a higher investment return rL makes
it more attractive to invest in the tax-deferred account. Second, the arbitrage benefit
increases with the investment horizon T as long as rL > (1 − τ )rB , since the money
grows tax-deferred for a longer period of time. Finally, this arbitrage strategy is always
feasible since it is “self-financed.” The only cash outflow implied by the strategy is the
additional mortgage payment on the terminal date, which is exactly covered by the
future withdrawal from the tax-deferred account. As a result, the household never needs
to put in additional money after pocketing the arbitrage profit (MAP).
If households continue to save in the future, this self-financing requirement yields conservative estimates of the arbitrage profit. In particular, if κT > 0, our strategy requires
households to withdraw and pay penalties in order to meet the additional mortgage
obligation at time T . However, if they can use other funds in their taxable accounts or

Note that the household receives $(1 − τ − κT ) for each dollar withdrawn rather than (1 − τ )(1 − κT )
since the penalty is not tax-deductible under the current tax code.

can reduce their future contributions to retirement accounts to satisfy these obligations,
they will be able to delay the withdrawal and avoid the penalty. Even when the penalty
is zero, delaying the withdrawal allows households to shelter assets from taxation for a
longer time period, and hence improves the arbitrage profit.
The MAP further underestimates the benefit of the tax arbitrage strategy if a household does not consume the arbitrage profit immediately. In particular, its current wealth
level is increased by the MAP amount. Without reducing its current consumption level
or altering any part of its remaining portfolio, it can contribute an additional amount
(up to the MAP measure) to its TDA. This additional contribution allows it to further
enjoy the benefit of tax-deferred savings. The proposed arbitrage transaction also ignores employer matches and deductibility of TDA contributions from state income taxes,
which increase its profitability.6

Discussion

We now discuss the robustness of the tax arbitrage strategy by relaxing the assumptions
in the previous section.

3.1

Stochastic Interest Rates

In our derivation of the tax arbitrage strategy in Section 2, both the mortgage borrowing
rate (rB ) and the tax-deferred investment return (rL ) are assumed to be constant over
time. These assumptions work well in the case of a household with a fixed-rate mortgage
that never refinances and that buys and holds to maturity Treasury bonds term-matched
to the remaining lifetime of its mortgage. While this scenario appears restrictive, we
argue below that it likely provides a lower bound on the tax-arbitrage gain.
6

The proposed strategy may also have an indirect benefit of reducing fixed participation costs as
discussed by Vissing-Jorgensen (2002) and encouraging equity market participation. Moving mortgage
prepayments to employer-sponsored TDA accounts introduces some households to an environment with
lower equity participation costs, either because of employer subsidies or simplified investment options.

7

First, since we restrict our empirical investigation to households with fixed rate
mortgages, the assumption of a constant rB is only violated if the mortgage is refinanced
in a year S < T . As long as the refinancing decision is driven purely by interest rate
0
considerations, the new mortgage rate rB
is less than rB . For each dollar following the

arbitrage strategy today, the mortgage obligation is increased by (1+(1−τ )rB )S at time
0 T −S
S, which grows to (1 + (1 − τ )rB )S (1 + (1 − τ )rB
)
at time T . The arbitrage strategy

also yields an extra X(1 + rL )T dollars in TDA, which is equal to (1 + (1 − τ )rB )T by (1),
and is higher than the new mortgage obligation. Hence, the arbitrage profit is increased
after the refinancing.
Second, while buying-and-holding Treasury bonds is generally feasible in the TDA, it
is conservative because interest rates on mortgages at origination tend to be significantly
higher than interest rates on Treasury bonds due to prepayment and default risks. To
get a better sense of the magnitude of the tax benefit, we maintain the overall risk
level of the household portfolio by allowing TDA contributions to be invested in passthrough instruments like a Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS), which pool individual
mortgages. Although there is still a mismatch in the default and prepayment risks
between an individual mortgage and an MBS, the MBS is generally less risky due to the
benefit of diversification. Moreover, an MBS has a variable maturity due to prepayment
and default risks, and its yields vary over time since they are typically sold through
mutual funds, which change their asset composition each year. In this setting, households
are trading off a fixed mortgage liability for an asset with variable rate of return and
maturity, both of which are affected by general movements in interest rates. Yet, we
still expect our estimation of the arbitrage profit to be rather conservative, since interest
rates have an asymmetric impact on the benefit of the tax arbitrage strategy. When
rates increase, households gain since the newly invested amount earns higher rates than
the corresponding liability. On the other hand, when rates go down, households are more

8

likely to exercise their option to refinance, reducing the downside risk of the arbitrage
strategy.

3.2

Moving-Related Prepayment Risks

In addition to falling interest rates, households may choose to pay off their entire mortgages early when they sell their existing homes, either because of relocations or simply
because of changes in tastes and housing needs.
We have shown that the tax arbitrage benefit can actually be improved if the prepayment is driven purely by interest rate considerations. If, on the other hand, interest
rates stay constant over time, the perturbation specified by the arbitrage strategy remains valid for an exogenous moving shock, as long as households are able to roll over
their mortgage debt into the new house.
When both the interest rate and moving risks are present, our tax strategy is no
longer a risk-free arbitrage. While households are clearly better off if they choose to
move when the interest rate goes down, it is also possible that they may need to move
0
when the interest rate goes up and the new mortgage borrowing rate becomes rB
> rB .
0 T −S
As a result, the extra mortgage obligation (1+(1−τ )rB )S (1+(1−τ )rB
)
is larger than

the potential withdrawal from the tax-deferred saving (1 + (1 − τ )rB )T , making it less
beneficial to follow our strategy. Of course, in this case, the overall loss from replacing
a lower-rate mortgage is substantially greater than the change in the value of the tax
strategy. To the extent that moving decisions are somewhat endogenous, households
may delay their moving and prepayment decisions when the interest rate environment
is not favorable. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that, although the combination of
moving and interest rate risks makes the tax strategy risky, its impact on the expected
profitability of the strategy is likely to be small.7
7

Quigley(2002) finds that households do, in fact, delay relocating when interest rates are rising.

9

3.3

Liquidity Risks

Our arbitrage strategy also assumes that households never face large liquidity needs that
may require them to take out additional home equity loans. At a first glance, paying
down a mortgage improves household borrowing capacity almost dollar-for-dollar by enabling higher home equity lines of credit (HELOC). Thus, concerns for future liquidity
needs may prompt households to accelerate home equity build-up and forgo implementing the arbitrage strategy. However, a comparison of relative liquidity characteristics of
HELOCs and TDAs is far from straightforward.
Most HELOCs are re-evaluated annually and may indeed be cancelled in the event
of job loss, making them a poor source of liquidity when it’s likely to be needed. On
the other hand, most households can borrow up to 50% of their TDA assets and in
worst-case scenarios (e.g. job loss or financial hardship) access TDA assets by paying
a 10% penalty. The tax burden on these hardship withdrawals tends to be low since
households will be in relatively low tax brackets under these circumstances.
Since the arbitrage strategy simply reallocates assets between accounts, its effect
on household’s liquidity is summarized by the difference in transaction costs. TDA
withdrawal penalties are likely costlier than the spread on home equity loans.8 Still,
as long as the probability q of liquidity event is low enough, the ex-ante expected cost
(q × 10%) is small relative to the expected arbitrage profit, which is in the range of
11-17% (as shown in Section 6).
Another reason that liquidity risks prove to be less relevant as a rational explanation
for forgoing the tax arbitrage profit is that fluctuations in future housing prices make
mortgage prepayments less effective as a mean to provide liquidity when needed. If
house prices appreciate significantly over time, then the amount of home equity is likely
to be sufficient to meet any liquidity needs even without mortgage prepayment. No
8

In our data set, the home equity loan has a mean interest rate of 9.3%, while the same household
has an average mortgage rate of 7.6%.

10

withdrawal from the tax-deferred account is necessary. On the other hand, if house
prices fall drastically to wipe out most of the equity, it is unlikely that the household
may be able to take out additional home equity loans, even if it has been diligently
prepaying the mortgage. In this case, had the household followed our tax strategy to
save in the tax-deferred account instead of prepaying the mortgage, the funds would
still be available for liquidity-related withdrawals. Hence, our strategy of saving in the
tax-deferred account has the additional benefit of providing a good hedge against the
combination of housing price risk and liquidity risk.

3.4

Default Risks

Default risks are extraordinary liquidity events in the future that may force households
to default on mortgage payments and hence lose their houses. A household may prefer
to pay off its mortgage before saving in retirement accounts in order to reduce the risk of
ever losing the house. Although reasonable on the surface, we argue that this argument
does not justify foregoing the tax-arbitrage either.
First, following the tax-arbitrage strategy is unlikely to increase the probability of
default for a household. Consider the case when the large liquidity event happens after
the household would have paid off its mortgage had it followed the accelerated payment
schedule. By construction, our tax arbitrage strategy is “self-financed” in the sense that
once the original plan would have paid off the mortgage, households rely solely on the
withdrawal from the tax-deferred account to pay for the remaining mortgage. Hence,
following the arbitrage strategy does not cause extra defaults in this case.
If, on the other hand, the liquidity event happens before the household would have
paid off its mortgage even under the accelerated schedule, borrowing or withdrawing from
the tax-deferred account is at least as effective as (if not more than, considering housing
price risks) prepaying the mortgage in meeting this liquidity need. Again, following the
arbitrage strategy does not increase the default risk.
11

Second, in the unfortunate event of personal bankruptcy, households are generally
better off had they followed the tax-arbitrage. As a federal policy, employer-sponsored
retirement savings are exempt from personal bankruptcy.9 On the other hand, homestead exemptions vary by state, with some states (e.g. Florida) allowing nearly unlimited
exemptions and others (e.g. Pennsylvania) only a token amount. In the event of large
liquidity shocks, our tax arbitrage strategy provides households with the additional option of defaulting on the house and claiming bankruptcy while at the same time retaining
their extra TDA savings. While the psychological costs of losing a house may be large,
this free option increases the benefit of the tax arbitrage strategy from a pure monetary
point of view, especially for residents of states with stringent homestead exemptions.10

3.5

Tax Environments

We have also made several simplifying assumptions regarding tax environments, the
most significant one being the constant tax rate over time.11 This assumption excludes
the possibilities of either changing tax laws or changing tax brackets over a household’s
lifetime. Although it is hard to predict the direction of tax law changes, the assumption
of a constant tax rate is likely conservative for estimating the tax benefits of our arbitrage
strategy. The tax rate for a given household is generally lower during retirement since the
taxable income is often lower. According to the 1995-2001 SCF data, 41% of households
are in the top four tax brackets (i.e., at or above 28%) before retirement while only
18% of households are in these top brackets after retirement.12 The household can also
optimally time the withdrawals from its retirement account to minimize the effective tax
9

Since the passage of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act in April 2005,
all IRA assets are fully protected from creditors in the event of bankruptcy. Prior to that, the amount
of IRA assets exempt from bankruptcy estate varied by state.

See, for example, White (1998) and Fay, Hurst, and White (2002) for a discussion of the household
bankruptcy decision.

See, for example, Sialm (2006) for a discussion of historical tax rates on investment income between
1926-2004.

Households are assumed to be retired if they receive positive Social Security, pension, or disability
income in the corresponding years.

12

burden. Hence, tax-deductible contributions are made when rates are relatively high and
taxable withdrawals are made when rates are relatively low, increasing the tax arbitrage
profit. To gauge sensitivity of the arbitrage strategy to changes in tax rates, we evaluate
a number of alternative tax scenarios in Section 6.3.
In this section we have argued that relaxing the assumptions of the illustrative arbitrage example is unlikely to eliminate gains from the strategy. However, whether
households use similar reasoning in practice is an open question. For example, they
may have a different perception of relative liquidity of the two savings choices, or not be
aware of differences in their bankruptcy treatment. We return to this question in our
empirical analysis of Section 7.

Data Sources

We use the 1995, 1998, and 2001 Surveys of Consumer Finances (SCF) to analyze the
actual savings behavior of households with mortgage debt and with the opportunity
to save in employer-sponsored tax-deferred retirement accounts. The surveys are conducted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and cover a substantial
cross-section of U.S. households. They collect data on many aspects of households’ financial situation–their financial, real estate, and pension assets, portfolio composition,
availability and price of credit, and sources of earnings.13
The surveys over-sample wealthy households, since these households own a disproportionate fraction of financial assets. We use a set of sampling weights from the SCF
to compute distributions of survey variables in the population. Unless otherwise noted,
all descriptive statistics utilize population weights.
Since our analysis focuses on evaluating the trade-off between saving in retirement
accounts and through additional mortgage payments, SCF data on real estate holdings,
financing, and on tax-deferred savings choices are of particular interest. For each house13

See Kennickell and Starr-McCluer (1994) for a description of the SCF data set.

13

hold in the sample, the SCF collects exhaustive information on home ownership status
and financing characteristics. Thus, we know whether a household owns its home and
if so, whether it still has an outstanding mortgage. We know the key characteristics
of mortgages such as their current interest rate, mortgage term, remaining as well as
original balance, and whether a mortgage is an adjustable rate or a balloon mortgage.
Moreover, we know whether a household is actively prepaying its mortgage, sticking to
the original payment schedule, or falling behind scheduled payments.
We distinguish between two different methods of prepayments: discretionary and
those due to short mortgages, which are defined as mortgages with a term of less than
30 years. Discretionary prepayments occur if households make payments in addition
to their required mortgage obligations at regular or irregular intervals. We identify
discretionary prepayments from household responses to the SCF question on whether
they are ahead, behind, or on time with their mortgage payments.14
Unfortunately, the SCF does not ask prepaying households for the exact amount or
the frequency of discretionary prepayments. However, they are asked for an expected
date of full repayment. By contrasting this date with the original mortgage term and
assuming a constant prepayment schedule, we are able to estimate the additional annual
mortgage payments.15 We define prepayments due to short mortgages as the difference
between the required payment on the existing mortgage and a required payment on a hypothetical 30-year mortgage that the household could have taken out on the origination
date. Specifically, we derive the average mortgage rates from the Freddie Mac series of
the average initial contract rate on new commitments for 15- and 30-year conventional
fixed-rate mortgages with 80% loan-to-value ratios. For each household with a 15-year
14

Using this method, we classify about 16% of households with 30-year fixed-rate mortgages as “discretionary prepayers.” This number is very similar to the 14% incidence of accelerated repayments
reported by Fu et al. (1997) on the basis of administrative records of Citibank mortgage holders
between 1995 and 1997.
15
We also investigate alternative discretionary prepayment measures, which are based on the comparison of the reported current mortgage balance with the balance expected if only required payments were
made. If the former is smaller, a household is effectively ahead of its mortgage repayment schedule.
Our results remain qualitatively similar if we use this alternative prepayment measure.

14

mortgage, for example, we compute the difference between its mortgage rate and the
average rate on 15-year mortgages taken on the same date. Assuming that this quality spread is independent of the mortgage term, we can add it to the average 30-year
mortgage rate to construct the rate on a hypothetical 30-year mortgage. Hence, our
calculation takes into account the slope of the yield curve that usually implies a lower
15-year mortgage rate than a 30-year rate.
In order to evaluate possible benefits of saving in a TDA, we need to identify TDAeligible households and estimate the extent to which they can increase their TDA contributions. An accurate measure of eligibility can be constructed from a number of
sequential responses to questions about features of employment-related pension coverage. We follow the methodology in Pence (2001) to identify households that are eligible
for (but don’t necessarily participate in) high-limit employer-sponsored defined contribution retirement plans.
Household contributions to employer-sponsored TDA plans are reported separately
for each household member. However, annual limits on household TDA contributions
are less straightforward, as they are determined by the individual’s wage income and
employer policies. In 2001, each TDA participant was limited to a before-tax contribution of $10,500 (IRC 402(g) limit). In addition, the sum of employee and employer
contributions is subject to an additional restriction of the lesser of $35,000 or 25% of
compensation (IRC 415(c) limit). Moreover, many plans impose their own limits on
employee contributions in order to make it easier to pass non-discrimination tests. Since
the SCF has no information on employer-specific TDA plan features, we choose a conservative approach and define the contribution limit in 2001 for each household member
as the lesser of $10,500 or 10% of their reported wages. For 1995 and 1998, we use
the corresponding IRC 402(g) limits, which are $9,240 and $10,000, respectively. Next,
we compute the “TDA contribution gap” by differencing the actual contribution and

15

the imputed limit for each eligible household member. Summing up these gaps for all
household members gives us a measure of the extent to which a given household can
increase its TDA contributions.
A significant number of SCF respondents are self-employed and, under the current tax
code, they have the right to open IRA-type accounts with high contribution limits and
nearly unrestricted investment choices.16 However, since the actual TDA contributions
by the self-employed are unknown, we choose to restrict the definition of eligibility to
households with at least one member that can participate in an employer-sponsored
plan. We also ignore the role of IRAs in defining TDA eligibility. Although IRAs are
broadly available, their contribution limits are small and the SCF has no data on actual
IRA contributions. Both of these choices are conservative as they limit the universe
of households that can potentially benefit from modifying their savings choices and are
likely to bias the contribution gaps towards zero.
For investments in the TDA we consider two scenarios in which households hold
either mortgage-backed securities (MBS) or Treasury bonds with the same maturity as
the remaining mortgage horizon. The yield on Treasury bonds for various maturities
is linearly interpolated between the 10-year yield and the 30-year yield reported by
Bloomberg for each of the three survey years. The MBS returns of different maturity
are also linearly interpolated using yields on 15- and 30-year current coupon agency
MBS (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) as reported by Bloomberg. Note that the average
yield on Treasury bonds is substantially lower than the average mortgage rate in our
sample, primarily because Treasury bonds do not have default and prepayment risks as
individual mortgages. The average investment rate on MBS assets is also lower than the
average mortgage borrowing rate, due to the transaction costs of processing mortgages
and constructing MBS assets. As discussed in Section 3.1, investing in Treasury securities
16

There are several such accounts - Keogh, SEP-IRA, etc. - all of which have high contribution limits.
For example, Keogh plans allow one to save up to $40,000 per year in combined employee and employer
contributions.

16

provides a lower bound on the tax-arbitrage profit, while investing in MBS provides a
better estimate of the magnitude of the tax benefit. We do not consider additional
asset classes (e.g. equities) in our main results, because we do not want to change the
aggregate risk level of the portfolio.
In addition to the variables that describe mortgage characteristics and TDA savings choices, we include a number of controls that reflect household wealth, income,
demographics, measures of financial savvy, liquidity constraints, self-reported reasons
for savings, and levels of risk and debt aversion. All of these variables are available in
the SCF. Finally, our estimates of households marginal tax rates (MTR) are derived
from TAXSIM calculations based on SCF income data.17

Summary Statistics

Homeowners with mortgage debt face the decision of whether to save first by repaying
their mortgage early or by contributing to a tax-deferred retirement account. As discussed in Section 2, this decision depends on numerous individual characteristics, such
as the mortgage interest rate, the investment opportunities, the effective tax rate, the
saving horizon, and additional liquidity and borrowing constraints facing a household.
In this section we divide households into distinct groups on the basis of their TDA and
mortgage prepayment decisions and provide a high-level comparison of key characteristics of these groups to set the stage for the subsequent analysis of their choices

5.1

Household Characteristics by Eligibility and Home Ownership

Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of households according to their savings opportunities. The three columns display characteristics of all households (column 1), of
17

We are very grateful to Kevin Moore and Dan Feenberg for computing these marginal tax rates.
Additional information on this microsimulation model can be found in Feenberg and Coutts (1993).

17

households that are eligible to contribute to employer-sponsored retirement accounts
(column 2), and of those eligible households that own houses and have fixed rate mortgage debt (column 3). Our complete sample over the three survey years includes 13,046
observations that are based on an average of 102.7 million households per year using
the population weights given in the SCF. Slightly less than half of the households are
eligible to contribute to an employer-sponsored TDA. Slightly less than half of these
eligible households have a fixed-rate mortgage on their home. Thus, the average sample
of households that face the TDA-mortgage prepayment tradeoff contains 22.8 million
households per survey.
To describe the distribution of household characteristics in our paper, we summarize
the mean and the inter-quartile ranges (IQR) of the corresponding variables. Households
that are eligible to contribute to an employer-sponsored retirement account tend to be
younger primarily because retired households do not have the opportunity to save in
retirement accounts. Eligible households are better educated than non-eligible households: 43.4% of eligible households have a college degree, while only 24.0% of non-eligible
households have a college degree. This difference occurs because retirement plans tend
to be more prevalent in companies where a large fraction of employees are professionals.
Eligible households receive significantly higher incomes and are in higher tax brackets
than non-eligible households.
The income and wealth distribution is highly skewed to the right, resulting in significantly higher means than medians. For example, the mean normal household income
level for the three survey years sample is $54,211, while the median income level is
just $35,977. The differences are much more pronounced for wealth levels. The mean
household net worth in the SCF sample is $280,689, which exceeds the 75 percentile of
$205,600. These results confirm the well-known observation that the aggregate wealth
is concentrated among a relatively small fraction of the population.18
18

See Poterba (2000) for a description of the wealth concentration in the U.S.

18

Comparing the second and the third columns indicates that eligible homeowners with
outstanding mortgage debt tend to have higher income and wealth levels than all eligible
households. The following sections focus on this last group of households which have
the choice of saving by building up home equity or retirement assets.19
In unreported analysis, we have divided our sample into the three waves of the Survey
of Consumer Finances. Most household characteristics and our main results remain the
same over the time periods. So we do not differentiate among the survey years in the
remainder of the paper.

5.2

Household Characteristics by Saving Behavior

We sort the sample of eligible households with fixed-rate mortgage debt into four different groups according to their TDA contribution and mortgage prepayment behavior.
Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of households for these four groups. The first
sorting criterion depends on the contribution to the employer-provided retirement account. We observe that 34.6% of eligible households with fixed-rate mortgages (7.9
million households per year) do not contribute at all. To economize on space, we average over prepaying and non-prepaying households to report household characteristics by
their contribution decisions. On average, non-contributing households could contribute
an additional $5,640 to their TDAs, while contributing households could increase their
contributions further by $2,814 before reaching the contribution limit.
These results indicate that many households do not take full advantage of the taxqualified retirement savings opportunities. These households might relinquish substantial tax benefits and matching contributions of their employers. This fact is particularly
puzzling as many of these households own substantial financial assets, which they could
effectively transfer to their retirement accounts. Non-contributing households in our
19

In our sample, 89% of households with mortgage debt have a fixed-rate mortgage. We focus on
fixed-rate mortgages because we do not know the exact adjustment pattern and frequency for adjustablerate mortgages. However, households using adjustable-rate mortgages can also use similar arbitrage
strategies as the ones described in our paper if they use floating-rate bonds instead of fixed-rate bonds.

19

sample own, on average, taxable financial assets with a total value of $73,375. This average financial wealth level is skewed to the right as a small number of households own
very large portfolios of liquid financial assets. However, 53.9% of these non-contributing
households own liquid financial assets exceeding $10,000.
The second sorting criterion depends on whether a household accelerates its mortgage
payoff either by making additional discretionary payments or by choosing a short-term
mortgage. We quantify both types of prepayments using the methodology described in
the preceding section. Aggregating over different contribution groups, we find that 46.1%
of eligible households with fixed-rate mortgages (10.5 million households) accelerate their
payments. Prepaying households make, on average, total prepayments of $3,140 per year,
where average discretionary prepayments amount to $1,482 and additional prepayments
due to short-term mortgages amount to $1,658.
Combining the findings between the mortgage prepayment and the non-contribution
decisions, we have identified a substantial group of households that face the tradeoff
between TDA contribution and mortgage prepayments. We can utilize the arguments
in Sections 2–3 to check whether they are acting efficiently. It is particularly interesting
to compare the characteristics of the households in columns two (prepay and not contribute) and three (contribute and not prepay) of Table 2. These households tend to save
similar amounts through prepayments and retirement account contributions. However,
the characteristics of these two groups of households differ substantially. As shown in
Panel B, the prepayers tend to be in better financial shape than the partial contributors,
which makes liquidity and other concerns identified in Section 3 less relevant and their
decision to forgo the tax arbitrage all the more puzzling.
Panel C summarizes the mortgage characteristics of the households. The mortgage
rate tends to be slightly lower for prepayers, because some prepayers have short-term
mortgages that tend to have lower interest rates. Not surprisingly, the prepayers tend

20

to have lower loan-to-value ratios, because many of these households also prepayed their
mortgages in the past, which reduced their outstanding balance.
Finally, Panel D provides information on household credit card balances. While
there exists a statistically significant difference in the share of prepayer and non-prepayer
households with revolving balances, credit card debt is still quite common among prepayers. Among households in the second column (prepay and not contribute) that carry
credit card debt, the median balance is $2,000 and the median annual interest rate
is 12 percent. These households would clearly benefit from curtailing prepayment of
lower-interest (and often tax-deductible) mortgage debt and using the funds to pay off
their credit cards. They could do even better by using some of their highly liquid funds
invested in low-yielding assets like savings and money market accounts. This puzzle,
highlighted by Gross and Souleles (2002) is intriguing, but it remains outside the scope
of this paper.20

Gains from the Tax Arbitrage Strategy

This section computes the gains that households may achieve by following the proper
trade-off between mortgage prepayments and contributions to tax-deferred accounts.
These computations are normative in nature, as they identify households that make
“suboptimal” choices and impute the magnitudes of likely losses. We show that many
households make costly errors with respect to two of their most common financial
decisions–saving in a tax-deferred account and building equity in their home.

6.1

Marginal Benefits of The Tax-Arbitrage Strategy

The data in Table 2 shows that many households face the TDA contribution-prepayment
tradeoff. As discussed in Section 2, whether these households could be made better off
20

See Haliassos and Reiter (2005) for a novel solution to this puzzle based on intra-household decision
making with heterogeneous preferences (the ”accountant-shopper” framework).

21

by decreasing their prepayments and increasing their contributions to the retirement
account depends on households characteristics like available mortgage rate, investment
opportunities, effective tax burden, time horizon, and so on. While the reshuffling of
savings choices may not be optimal for all households, we can estimate the fraction of
households that would be better off by changing their saving strategies.
We start by computing the marginal tradeoffs between accelerating mortgage payments and saving for retirement in the tax-deferred account. This tradeoff is given by
the MAP measure as derived in equation (2). We use the actual mortgage rates of
the households for rB and the current interest rates on mortgage-backed securities or
Treasury bonds for the investment rates rL , as discussed in Section 4. Mortgage interest is assumed to be deductible at the tax rate τ only if the households currently
itemize deductions. For non-itemizing households we assume that mortgage interest is
not deductible. The investment horizon T equals the remaining maturity of the current
mortgage. Finally, TDA withdrawals face a penalty of 10% if the retirement account
holder is younger than 59 21 years.
Table 3 summarizes the measure of MAP for households in our sample. Panel A assumes that the retirement account is invested in MBS with a remaining maturity equal
to that of the mortgage. We demonstrate that a significant share of prepaying households would benefit from our proposed tax arbitrage by transferring the prepayments
to mortgage-backed securities in their retirement accounts. For example, 43.4% of eligible households that make prepayments and do not contribute exhibit positive arbitrage
gains. The mean arbitrage gain from switching $100 from a mortgage prepayment to a
retirement account amounts to $17.20 for this group. The distribution of the benefits
is relatively broad and the inter-quartile range varies between 7.7 and 23.7%. We can
interpret the MAP as the extra return that households can earn on their savings by
simply choosing the proper saving channel. The 17.20% is the present value of extra

22

future returns, which amounts to more than 1% of extra return per year given the average horizon of households of 17 years in our sample. Considering the difficulty for most
mutual funds to generate this level of abnormal performance, our return from the simply
tax-arbitrage strategy is rather impressive.
We obtain very similar results for households that make discretionary prepayments
and contribute to their employer-sponsored retirement accounts. Note, however, that of
the 3.5 million households with positive MAPs in this group, only 2.5 million that are
not bound by the contribution limit would benefit from the proposed tax arbitrage. The
mean marginal gain for such households equals 16.6%.
Panel B summarizes the distribution of the tax benefits if the retirement account
is invested in Treasury bonds instead. As discussed in Section 3.1, this conservative
approach provides a lower bound on the tax benefit. It is comforting that we still obtain
a MAP of about 11% for those households that prepay.

6.2

Total Benefits of The Tax-Arbitrage Strategy

To quantify the Total Arbitrage Profit (TAP) for each household, we multiply the
Marginal Arbitrage Profit (MAP) by the minimum of the total prepayment and the
contribution gap:
T APi = M APi × min(P repaymenti , ContrGapi ).

(3)

The TAP is positive only if the household has a positive MAP and if it is prepaying and
not contributing the maximum possible to the TDA.
In Table 3, we show that, on average, prepaying households that do not contribute
forgo a TAP of $394 per year. The TAP measures are, on average, slightly smaller
for prepaying households that already contribute to a retirement account. Overall, an
average contributing household forgoes a TAP amounting to $375 per year. With a total
of about 4 million households experiencing a positive TAP, we calculate that households
23

can gain about 1.5 billion dollars in tax benefits by following our tax strategy.
Households do not have an option to replace a short-term mortgage with a longterm mortgage without refinancing. On the other hand, it is relatively easy to simply
discontinue the discretionary mortgage prepayments. Therefore, we also report the TAP
separately between the gains that occur from discretionary prepayments and short-term
mortgages. Since a small number of households prepay in both manners and face binding
constraints, the total TAP is slightly smaller than the sum of the two individual TAPs.
We find that the average TAP from discretionary prepayments is larger than the TAP
from short-term mortgages.
In Panel B, we show that even under the most conservative assumption of investing
in Treasury bonds in TDA, we have 2.5 million households with positive TAPs, leaving
an aggregate of $637 million per year on the table by prepaying and not contributing to
the maximum extent.

6.3

Alternative Scenarios

In this subsection, we calculate the forgone arbitrage gains using alternative assumptions
about future tax rates, employer matches, withdrawal penalties, and state taxes.
Our calculation of MAP in (2) has assumed a constant tax rate over time. As
discussed in Section 3.5, tax rates can change over time either due to frequent tax
reforms or due to the change in taxable income throughout the lifetime of a household,
which generally put households in lower tax brackets during retirement. A higher tax
rate in the future has two effects on the arbitrage profit: First, the mortgage interest
payments receive higher tax deduction over time, which improves the arbitrage profit.
Second, the withdrawal from the TDA on the terminal date is worth less after-tax, which
reduces the arbitrage profit. Hence, the least favorable tax situation for a household is
an increase in the tax rate only on the terminal date.
In Table 4, we report the forgone arbitrage profit for several alternative scenarios
24

in which tax rates at withdrawal (T ) and during the remaining mortgage term (T − t)
are allowed to vary from the current reported marginal tax rates. The first row repeats
the forgone arbitrage profits and the number of affected households for our base-case
scenario described in Table 3. We start by considering several scenarios in which the
marginal tax rate changes only at the time of withdrawal, which yields more extreme
results.21
Rows (2) and (3) assume that marginal tax rates will increase or decrease by 25%
for all tax brackets at time T . For example, the marginal tax rate of a household in the
28% tax bracket would either increase to 35% or decrease to 21%. A future tax increase
reduces the number of households with positive MAPs from 3.9 million to 2.7 million and
reduces the average MAPs slightly. Thus, the aggregate forgone tax benefit decreases
from $1.52 billion to $0.86 billion. On the other hand, a reduction in the tax rates at
withdrawal would increase the aggregate subsidy to $2.36 billion. A more extreme 50%
increase in the tax rates across the board will reduce the number of affected households
to 1.5 million. Even in this worst-case tax scenario for our strategy, however, the forgone
tax benefit amounts to about $400 million.
The following four scenarios (rows (6)-(9)), change the progressivity of the tax system
by increasing or decreasing the tax rates of only the top three tax brackets. This setup
is similar in spirit to the 1993 tax increase, which was motivated in part by mounting
budgetary pressures. Furthermore, the scenarios in rows (8) and (9) implement the
change in tax rates five years from the survey date. In the case of tax increases (8),
the negative effect of higher taxes at withdrawal is now counterbalanced by the greater
attractiveness of the mortgage interest deduction in the intervening years (from t + 5 to
T ). On net, the total forgone tax benefit declines to $1.37 billion.
Many employers provide matching TDA contributions. With matches, a household
21

Admittedly, it is difficult to imagine implementation of such tax reform, since it would affect different
households at different points in time. We also consider a more realistic situation in which the tax rate
changes five years from the survey date and remain fixed until the terminal date.

25

can finance the arbitrage strategy by contributing less of each dollar saved from mortgage
repayment. Assuming an employer match of $m for each $1 in contributions, the amount
required to repay the extra mortgage balance at T decreases from X, defined in (1), to
X 0 = X/(1 + m), resulting in a new MAP of 1 − (1 − τ )X 0 , which is higher than
the existing MAP in (2). However, matches are nearly always capped at a certain
percentage of salary and both the cap and match vary across employers. Since the SCF
only reports the product of these two terms (i.e. the total employer match), we assume
a common match rate of 0.5 applied to contributions up to 6% of total salary. This
matching schedule mimics the most common practice of U.S. employers (Engelhardt
and Kumar, 2006). Row (10) of Table 4 shows this scenario applied to households that
report having an employer match component in their TDA. Contributions beyond the
assumed matching cap are valued using the MAP measure in (2).
As conjectured, allowing employer matching substantially increases the attractiveness
of the arbitrage strategy. The mean marginal gain from a re-allocated dollar in mortgage
prepayment jumps to 38%, and the aggregate subsidy value increases to $2.64 billion.
The average gain rises more modestly, as many of the extra 1.7 million households with
positive MAP values find it optimal to contribute only up to the matching limit which
restricts their dollar gains from following the strategy.
The table also reports scenarios that allow deductibility of TDA contributions and
mortgage interest payments from state taxes and eliminate early withdrawal penalties.
In particular, the gains would be significantly higher if households avoid withdrawing
TDA funds early to eliminate the 10% early withdrawal penalty. Since the public SCF
data do not include information on the households’ state of domicile, we do not include
state taxes in our computations. However, row (12) evaluates a hypothetical case of
mortgage interest and TDA deductions from a uniform 5% state tax. Doing so increases
the aggregate forgone tax benefit to $1.93 billion.

26

6.4

Characteristics of Losers and Winners from Arbitrage

To set the stage for further analysis on why households leave money on the table, we
summarize the characteristics of households that benefit or lose from our proposed arbitrage in Table 5. Panel A summarizes the main determinants of the gains of the proposed
arbitrage. Households that gain from our proposed arbitrage tend to be slightly older,
primarily because older households are less likely to face the 10% early withdrawal
penalty. It is not surprising that the winners have lower mortgage interest rates and
lower mortgage spreads than the losers. Finally, arbitrage winners tend to be in higher
tax brackets than arbitrage losers.
Panel B summarizes the wealth characteristics of winners and losers. The average
net worth of the households that currently do not contribute to an employer-sponsored
retirement account and that would gain from our proposed arbitrage amounts to $551,529
and more than 75% of these households have a total net worth exceeding $100,000.
A significant fraction of this net worth is held in liquid non-retirement assets and in
home equity. The average non-retirement liquid wealth equals $142,063. Moreover, only
10% of these households have current loan-to-value ratios exceeding 80%, which might
result in additional mortgage insurance premia. We obtain very similar results if we
focus on households that make partial contributions to their retirement accounts. This
indicates that it is unlikely that a large fraction of the winners face substantial liquidity
constraints, which would induce them to save by paying down their mortgage instead of
saving in a retirement account.

7

An Empirical Analysis of Prepayment and Retirement Saving Decisions

As shown in the preceding sections, a significant number of households fail to make
wealth-maximizing decisions with respect to two of their most significant assets–housing

27

wealth and tax-deferred retirement accounts. In particular, we showed that when faced
with the trade-off between paying off an extra dollar of mortgage and saving that dollar
in a tax-deferred retirement account, households often choose an inferior strategy leading
to large aggregate losses.
Our goal in this section is to provide some explanation for this seemingly inefficient
behavior. We focus on four non-exclusive possibilities–(a) households are constrained
by their liquidity and consumption needs; (b) information required for making a proper
choice is limited or costly; (c) household decisions are influenced by certain institutional
features, such as private mortgage insurance (PMI) and bankruptcy law;22 and (d)
household choices are distorted by specific preferences over the form of saving and perceived differences in risk and liquidity characteristics between the two savings habitats.
A particular form of preferences in (d) is referred to as “debt aversion.” For example,
debt-averse households may find mortgage repayment that directly reduces their debt a
more appealing savings choice, even though it may result in lower net worth than TDA
contributions.
The intuition for each of these classes of explanations is straightforward. Not having
enough current resources may curtail the ability of some households to make decisions on
the infra-marginal level. Moreover, liquidity-constrained households would put greater
emphasis on accessibility of saved assets, and would thus favor savings habitats that they
perceive as more liquid. Limited information may preclude an objective cost-benefit
analysis of the tradeoff.
On the other hand, choosing to forgo the arbitrage strategy may be a rational response to certain institutional factors. As described in Section 3.4, households in high
homestead-exemption states may choose to build up their home equity as a means to
shelter assets in the event of bankruptcy. Similarly, households may be accelerating
22

PMI is mortgage guarantee insurance offered by the private insurance market which protects the
lender from a loss in the event of default. Lenders typically require PMI on mortgages that have
loan-to-value ratios of greater than 80 percent.

28

repayment to bring their loan-to-value ratios below the 80 percent threshold, thereby
obtaining an option to eliminate PMI payments.
Turning to preferences, more risk-averse households may choose to forgo an increase
in expected wealth since the proposed exchange of a mortgage dollar for a TDA dollar
is risky when the latter is invested in, say, an MBS fund. Finally, being motivated by
a “socially acceptable” savings goal like debt-free home ownership may eliminate other
savings vehicles from the set of alternative investment choices.
Our empirical analysis is structured as follows. First, we consider the determinants
of each of the savings choices - having a short maturity mortgage, making discretionary
mortgage prepayments, and contributing to TDA - and analyze whether these choices are
made jointly. We next look at the relative preference for retirement savings, by analyzing
the share of total TDA-mortgage savings that is attributable to TDA contributions. In
particular, we test the hypothesis that households understand the tradeoff between these
two forms of savings and tilt their choice towards TDA contributions when it is more
beneficial to do so (i.e., when MAP is higher). We further test whether the hypothesized
relationship between MAP and TDA-mortgage savings decision varies with household
preferences and knowledge.

7.1

Variable Definitions

Throughout this section, we will be using a vector of explanatory variables based on the
discussion in the preceding subsection. Taking the choice to hold a short mortgage as
an example, we estimate the following probit regression:
ShortM ortgagei = β1 M AP Componentsi + β2 Liq.Constraintsi + β3 Inf ormationi (4)
+ β4 Institutionsi + β5 P ref erencesi + β6 EmployerM atchi + β7 Demographicsi + ui
Regressors that make up the vector of MAP components include (a) the spread
between the existing mortgage rate and the MBS rate at the time of the survey, in29

terpolated over the remaining mortgage term (rB − rL ), (b) the federal tax bracket in
the year preceding the survey, and (c) an indicator variable for households that itemize
deductions.
We define liquidity constraints by combining information from several survey questions. Liquidity-constrained households are defined as those that satisfy at least one of
the following conditions: (i) they were turned down for credit at least once during the
past five years, (ii) were not able to obtain this credit later or were discouraged from
applying again, or (iii) have credit card balances in excess of 75% of their total credit
card borrowing limit. Household wealth is another indicator of liquidity constraints,
measured by the logarithm of household net worth.
We use two binary variables to gauge how easy it is to acquire and to analyze information necessary for making financial decisions. The first is a simple indicator variable for
having a college degree. The second takes on a value of one for households that consult
a professional in “making savings and investment decisions”. The list of suitably knowledgeable professionals includes accountants, bankers, brokers, and financial planners.
About 49% of households in our sample relied on advice from such professionals.
Residence in a high homestead exemption state and presence of PMI serve to describe the institutional setting. About 19% of households in our sample reside in “High
Homestead Exemption”states (defined as states with a statutory homestead exemption
of at least $100,000), and about 22% report carrying PMI.23
One of the measures of preference heterogeneity is the self-reported willingness to take
on financial risk which ranges from 1 to 4, with the value of 4 indicating “unwillingness
to take any financial risks.” Our measure of household tolerance for debt is based on
reported behavior with respect to paying off credit card debt. This binary variable is set
23

High Homestead Exemption states include FL, IA, KS, OK, SD, and TX, which have no limits,
and AZ, MA, MN, NV, and RI, which have exemptions above $100,000. Restricting ”high exemption”
states to those with no limits does not affect the results. We are indebted to Kevin Moore of the Board
of Governors for estimating regression specifications with state-specific variables using internal SCF
data.

30

to one for those that report paying off their balances in full “always or almost always”.
Arguably, such payment behavior reflects not only the household’s ability to pay but
also its determination to restrict its spending to what it can afford. Consequently, we
interpret this variable as an indicator of debt aversion.
The vector of regressors is rounded out by a measure of attractiveness of TDA contributions and simple demographics. We would expect the magnitude of employer match
to affect mortgage prepayment choice only if this form of savings is a substitute or a
complement of TDA contributions.24 The vector of demographic characteristics contains
the number of children in the household, as well as age and marital status. Finally, we
also include survey year and mortgage origination year dummies, where the latter control for exogenous changes in the structure of mortgage markets. Table 6 contains the
moments and the pairwise correlations between the various explanatory variables.

7.2

What Influences Prepayment and Contribution Behavior?

From the outset, we limit the sample to home owners with outstanding fixed-rate mortgages who are eligible to participate in employer-sponsored tax-deferred plans. These
households face an active choice between prepayment and TDA contributions.
Table 7 presents the results of estimating probit regressions (4) for each of the three
savings choices separately. The leftmost column shows the estimated marginal effects of
the regressors on the choice of a short-maturity mortgage. We find that variables pointing
to a higher MAP are associated with a lower likelihood of prepayment, as suggested by
the argument in Section 2. In particular, the likelihood of holding a short mortgage
decreases with the borrowing-lending spread. A lower spread implies that it is more
attractive to decrease monthly mortgage payments by switching to a 30-year mortgage
and to invest the difference in TDA. Of the two tax variables, itemization (which is
24

We also conduct a more formal test of independence between the mortgage prepayment and TDA
contribution decisions, which is discussed later in this section.

31

a necessary condition for writing off mortgage interest expense) has a strong negative
effect, with itemizers being 8 percentage points less likely to hold a short mortgage.
Taking out a short mortgage requires a commitment to higher monthly cash payments. Consequently, we find strong effects for variables that indicate availability of
financial resources. In particular, liquidity-constrained households are found to be 9
percentage points less likely to have a short mortgage. Household net worth is another
key factor behind this decision. The estimated coefficient suggests that each percentage
point increase in net worth leads to about a 5% rise in the probability of prepayment
via a short mortgage. In a similar vein, we find that households making PMI payments
are less likely to take out short-term mortgages. On the other hand, there is no evidence
that residing in a high-exemption state affects the term of the mortgage significantly.
We further find that more risk-averse households are marginally more likely to hold
short mortgages. One of the frequently told stories for mortgage prepayment is the
desire to be “free of debt,” even if it entails sacrificing current consumption to achieve
this goal. Thus, we would expect households that strive to be debt-free to make natural
candidates for committed prepayment in the form of a short mortgage. Consistent with
this conjecture, we find that debt averse households are more likely to choose short
mortgages (and, as shown later, make discretionary prepayments).25
In sum, the decision to have a short maturity mortgage is affected by a number of
variables that conform to rational models of financial decision-making. There is some
evidence that households making such choice have less to gain from the interest rate
deduction, have the financial wherewithal for higher payments (higher net worth and no
liquidity constraints), and are more debt-averse.
25

One could make a case for the endogeneity of our measure of debt aversion, since the decision
to pay off a credit card and make an extra mortgage payment are made simultaneously. However,
as argued earlier, paying off credit card balances in full is an indicator of household consumption and
savings tastes. As such, this variable provides useful information of what otherwise would be an omitted
measure of household heterogeneity, and it is kept in reported regression specifications. For robustness,
we re-estimated all regressions without this variable. Omitting debt aversion makes the effect of net
worth more positive and raises its statistical significance. There are no qualitative changes in any of
the other coefficients.

32

It is more difficult to find influence of such rational factors on the decision to make
discretionary prepayments, however. As shown in the middle column of Table 7, few
factors have statistically significant explanatory power for the household choice to write
additional checks to their mortgage company. We still find that being subject to liquidity
constraints serves as a barrier to making mortgage prepayments, even when such prepayments do not require the commitment associated with short maturity mortgages. Also,
debt aversion increases the likelihood of discretionary prepayments. However, there is
no evidence that a household’s financial position (whether in the form of net worth or
current income as proxied by the tax variables) plays a role in this decision. Nor is there
much support for the motive to eliminate PMI or build up more home equity for possible bankruptcy. Moreover, the estimated coefficient on the borrowing-lending spread
is negative, implying that households for whom the current investment opportunities
are poor (high spread) are nevertheless less likely to pay off their expensive mortgage
obligations.
For completeness, we model the TDA contribution decision as a function of the same
set of factors. The estimation results are shown in the rightmost column of Table 7. We
find that households with high current income (i.e. those in high tax brackets) and those
itemizing tax deductions are more likely to contribute. Once again, we find evidence
of the importance of liquidity constraints, as liquidity constrained households shy away
from making TDA contributions. There is also a strong negative cohort effect in TDA
participation.
Interestingly, more risk averse households are less likely to contribute to TDAs, although risk aversion affects the prepayment decision only marginally. Debt aversion, on
the other hand, fails to show up in TDA contributions even though it features prominently in prepayment decisions. The TDA contribution decision is also strongly positively affected by the size of the employer match, which plays no role in the prepayment

33

decision. These results raise the possibility that the two types of decisions are somewhat
separable.
A better way to assess this hypothesis is to evaluate the likelihood of prepayment
and TDA contributions jointly, by allowing the error terms of these decisions to be
correlated. There may well be some unobserved factors that influence each of these
decisions, biasing the single-equation coefficients. To account for this possibility, we
estimate an unreported bivariate probit model of contribution and prepayment decisions.
Each equation contains one unique regressor to help with identification. The size of
the TDA match is excluded from the prepayment equation, while a dummy variable
identifying PMI-paying households is excluded from the contribution equation. Each of
the excluded variables is conjectured to influence one of the decisions without having a
direct effect on the other.
We cannot reject the hypothesis of independence between the two savings decisions
regardless of the way mortgage repayment is defined. To check whether some households
follow the explicit tradeoff implied by the MAP measure and whether their preference
and knowledge affect this decision, we turn to the analysis of the composition of savings
in the next section.

7.3

Relative Preference for Contributions vs. Prepayments

The dependent variable in this subsection, T DAF raction, captures the fraction of relevant savings that is directed towards tax-deferred contributions rather than prepayments.
T DAF raction ≡

T DAContribution
,
P repayment + T DAContribution

where P repayment is defined in turn as (i) the imputed prepayment from holding a
short mortgage, and (ii) the discretionary prepayment, and T DAContribution is the
total dollar contribution of all household members. T DAF raction is continuous by
34

construction, with values ranging from 0 to 1.
We proceed to estimate a variant of equation (4) using T DAF raction as the dependent variable and modifying the vector of explanatory variables in two ways. First, we
replace M AP components with the M AP itself. Since we are now looking explicitly at
the relative taste for TDA contributions versus prepayments, M AP is the proper measure for capturing the influence of “rational ” factors, in spite of its inherent nonlinearity.
In other words, if households are aware of the tax-arbitrage strategy, the M AP measure
should explain part of the cross-sectional differences in T DAF raction.
Recall that in theory higher M AP values indicate larger tax benefits for substituting
mortgage prepayments for TDA contributions. It is possible that the degree to which
households relate MAP to this tradeoff varies with certain household characteristics. For
instance, debt-averse households may be pre-occupied by the motive to reduce mortgage
debt and thus pay less attention to MAP, leading to a weaker positive relationship
with T DAF raction. To test this, we add interactions of M AP with preference and
information variables to the vector of regressors.
Note that T DAF raction cannot be defined for households that make no TDA contributions and no mortgage prepayments (henceforth, 0-0 households). The resulting
sample truncation opens up the possibility of selection bias. Therefore, prior to estimating a Tobit version of (4) for T DAF raction, we test for sample selection using a
standard Heckman two-step estimator (Heckman, 1976). We use self-reported saving
habits as instruments for identifying the choice to make at least one of the two savings
decisions and thus to be excluded from the 0-0 group. We find that households that save
regularly are indeed more likely to make prepayments or TDA contributions. However,
the estimated inverse Mills ratio is not statistically different from zero, and we therefore proceed to estimate regressions for T DAF raction on the truncated sample without
making adjustments for sample selection bias.

35

Table 8 presents the results for both definitions of prepayments. The comparison of
estimated M AP coefficients across the two prepayment types is quite jarring. Recall
that the intuition for M AP was derived from a hypothetical conversion of a dollar in
discretionary prepayments to a dollar in TDA contributions. Yet, although the tradeoff
between discretionary prepayments and TDA contributions is ideally suited to be made
on the basis of M AP , the estimated coefficient is of the wrong sign. It is surprising
that, on average, households for whom it is more advantageous to channel discretionary
prepayments into TDA contributions do precisely the opposite. In contrast, the revealed
taste for contributions is substantially higher for short-mortgage households with high
M AP values.
Specifications in columns (2) and (4) further decompose the effects of M AP on this
tradeoff. In the case of short mortgage prepayments, having access to better financial
information (either through a financial advisor or through a better education) substantially increases the likelihood of making the right choice, as both M AP interaction terms
on these variables are strongly positive. However, we fail to detect any moderating effect
of better information on making the correct choice in the case of discretionary prepayments. For both types of prepayments we find little evidence that household preferences
influence the mortgage-TDA tradeoff through M AP . There is also no measurable difference for households not subject to TDA withdrawal penalties, for whom TDA savings
have few drawbacks. In the case of discretionary prepayments, this means that nonpenalized households are just as likely to be forgoing the arbitrage, reminiscent of the
results in Choi, Laibson, and Madrian (2005).
Similar to the results in Table 7, we find that characteristics other than M AP influence households’ relative preferences towards mortgage prepayment or TDA savings. As
argued earlier in section 3.3, it is difficult to claim that home equity is unambiguously
more liquid that TDA assets. The results in Table 8 are consistent with this view. In

36

only one of the specifications the liquidity-constrained households are found to have different relative preferences. Even in this case, they display a greater taste for retirement
contributions, contrary to the common view that home equity provides better liquidity.
Notwithstanding the relative strength of the effects of liquidity constraints on prepayments and TDA contributions (see Table 7), both of these forms of savings appear to be
negatively affected by liquidity considerations. This suggests that liquidity-constrained
households may prefer to first build up wealth in liquid taxable accounts instead.
Preference heterogeneity shows up consistently in each of the specifications. We find
that households that are more risk- and debt-averse generally favor mortgage prepayments over TDA contributions. The finding that debt-averse households focus on paying
off their debt obligations is consistent with the hypothesis that preferences for specific
forms of wealth may override the goal of maximizing the overall wealth level.

8

Conclusion

We characterize the optimal tradeoff between contributing an extra dollar of savings
towards accelerating mortgage payments and saving that extra dollar in tax-qualified
retirement accounts. We show that it is often a tax-arbitrage to reduce prepayments
and increase TDA contributions. We document actual household behavior using data
from the Survey of Consumer Finances, and conclude that about 38% of households who
prepay their mortgages could benefit from our proposed arbitrage strategy. Depending
on the choice of the investment asset in the TDA, the median gain from such a reallocation ranges between 11 and 17 cents per dollar of “mis-allocated savings”. Finally,
we show empirically that this inefficient behavior is unlikely to be driven by liquidity or
other constraints, and that self-reported debt aversion and risk aversion variables explain
to some extent the household preference for paying off their debt obligations early and
hence the propensity to forgo our tax arbitrage.

Table 4: Alternative Scenarios for Evaluating Forgone Arbitrage Opportunities
This table summarizes the marginal (MAP) and the total arbitrage profit (TAP) under a number of alternative scenarios.
The sample is limited to households that have not exhausted their allowed TDA contributions. In all “time-T-only” scenarios,
we assume that only the MTR at withdrawal is affected; the current tax rates are used in valuing the tax deduction from
additional TDA contributions and deductibility of mortgage interest payments for tax itemizers. In the “employer match”
scenario, we assume an employer contribution of 50 cents per each $1 in TDA contributions, up to 6% of total salary.

Table 5: Characteristics of Households Which Prepay Mortgage
This table summarizes the characteristics of households from the 1995, 1998, and 2001
Surveys of Consumer Finances depending on whether they have positive or negative
MAPs. Prepayments include both discretionary prepayments and prepayments due to a
short-term mortgage. The number in the first row of each characteristic corresponds to
the weighted mean, where the weights are the population weights provided by the Survey
of Consumer Finances. The two numbers in brackets correspond to the interquartile
ranges of the characteristics.

Table 6: Correlations Between Explanatory Variables
This table summarizes the means, standard deviations and the correlations between the main explanatory variables of
mortgage prepayments and retirement account contributions. The significance levels are abbreviated with asterisks: ‘***’
corresponds to a 1% confidence level; ‘**’ corresponds to a 5% confidence level; and ‘*’ corresponds to a 10% confidence level.

Table 7: Determinants of Prepayment and Contribution Behavior
This table summarizes the determinants of the prepayment and contribution behavior
for households from the 1995, 1998, and 2001 Surveys of Consumer Finances. The dependent variables are indicator variables of (1) whether households have a short mortgage,
(2) whether they make discretionary prepayments, and (3) whether they contribute to a
TDA. The table summarizes the marginal effects of the probit regressions. The regressions also include unreported mortgage origination year fixed effects. The changes in
the probabilities are expressed in percent. The robust standard errors are summarized
in parentheses. The significance levels are abbreviated with asterisks: ‘***’, ‘**’, and
‘*’ correspond to a 1%, 5%, and 10% confidence levels, respectively.

Table 8: Determinants of the Relative Propensity to Contribute vs. Prepay
This table summarizes the determinants of the relative preference for retirement contributions relative to mortgage prepayments for households from the 1995, 1998, and 2001
Surveys of Consumer Finances. The dependent variables are ratios of contributions to
the sum of prepayments and contributions. The prepayments are defined as: (1) the difference between the actual payment on short mortgage and that on a 30-year mortgage,
and (2) dollar amount of discretionary prepayments. The table summarizes the estimated coefficients of Tobit regressions, with robust standard errors in parentheses. The
regressions also include unreported survey and mortgage origination year fixed effects.
The significance levels are abbreviated with asterisks: ‘***’, ‘**’, and ‘*’ correspond to
a 1%, 5%, and 10% confidence levels, respectively.
