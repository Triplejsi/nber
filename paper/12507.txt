ABSTRACT
We report results from economic experiments that provide a direct test of the hypothesis that criminal
behavior responds rationally to changes in the possible rewards and in the probability and severity
of punishment. The experiments involve decisions that are best described as petty larceny, and are
done using high school and college students who can anonymously take real money from each other.
We find that decisions about whether and how much to steal are, in general, rational and responsive
to the variations in tradeoffs, and sometimes, though not always, to the overall availability of criminal
opportunities.

An Experimental Test of Criminal Behavior among Juveniles and Young Adults

I. Introduction
Becker (1968) created the foundation for the economic analysis of criminal behavior.
Since then, economists have extended his basic theoretical framework in several directions,
but the basic argument remains – participation in crime is the result of an optimizing
individual’s response to incentives such as the expected payoffs from criminal activity, and
costs such as the probability of apprehension and the severity of punishment.1 Although some
early empirical research reported evidence suggesting that enhanced deterrence reduces
crime (Ehrlich 1973, Ehrlich 1975, Witte 1980, Layson 1985), other papers found no
significant evidence of deterrence (Myers 1983, Cornwell and Trumbull 1994). The main
challenge in empirical analysis has been to tackle the simultaneity between criminal activity
and deterrence. Specifically, an increase in criminal activity is expected to prompt an
increase in the certainty and severity of punishment (e.g. an increase in the arrest rate and/or
the size of the police force), which makes it difficult to identify the causal impact of
deterrence on crime.2
Recent research has employed three types of strategies to overcome the simultaneity
problem. The first solution is to find an instrument which is correlated with deterrence
measures but uncorrelated with crime. Examples are Levitt (1997) who uses electoral cycles
as an instrument for police hiring, and Levitt (2002) who uses the number of per capita
municipal firefighters as an instrument for police effort. The second strategy is to use high-

frequency time-series data. For example, in monthly data, an increase in the police force in a
given month will affect criminal activity in the same month, but an increase in crime cannot
alter the size of the police force in that same month because of the much longer lag between a
policy decision to increase the working police force and the actual deployment of police
officers on the street. This identification strategy has been employed by Corman and Mocan
(2000, 2005). The third strategy is to find a natural experiment which generates a truly
exogenous variation in deterrence, as in Di Tella and Schargrodsky (2004), who use the
increase in police protection around Jewish institutions in Buenos Aires after a terrorist
attack to identify the impact of police presence on car thefts.
Although these empirical strategies have permitted researchers to refine and improve
upon earlier estimates, a convincing natural experiment is very difficult to find, the validity
of any instrumental variable can always be questioned, and one can argue that if policy
makers have perfect foresight about future crime, monthly data could also suffer from
simultaneity.
In this paper, we use experiments to investigate individuals’ responses to
unambiguously exogenous changes in the rewards and penalties pertaining to criminal
behavior. The experiments involve decisions about actions that can best be described as
petty larceny – taking money from another individual, with a chance of getting caught and
having to repay everything taken, plus a fine. The experiments are done with high school
and college students, and are for real money. We collect information on (nearly)
simultaneous choices made by individuals under a variety of different criminal opportunities.
These choices are used to analyze whether the decisions to steal change rationally in response
to variations in the probability of detection and size of the fine.

2

The data are first used to check for transitivity violations. Since transitivity is a
necessary and sufficient condition for modeling choices as the result of constrained utility
maximization, this provides a direct test of Becker’s framework, which assumes rational
choice by criminals. We then estimate demand functions for stolen loot. In doing so we take
advantage of the fact that in an experimental setting we can induce exogenous variations in
the extent of criminal opportunities, such as the probability that a theft will be detected, or
the fine that ensues if the person is caught. These demand functions allow us to investigate
the responsiveness of the decision to steal and the amount of stolen money to variations in
the extent of attractiveness of criminal opportunities. Specifically, we are able to estimate
elasticities for criminal participation and the amount of money stolen with respect to the
terms of trade (or relative prices) between stolen loot and the probability of detection, and
between stolen loot and the fine.3
Section II provides a brief description of revealed preference theory, and the
experimental methods for testing it. Section III describes the experimental design. Section
IV presents the results on revealed preference and estimated demand for stolen loot, and
section V concludes.
II. Revealed Preference
The basic principle of a revealed preference test can be seen in Figure 1, for the case
of two goods and two constraints. Choosing a from A and b from B is irrational by the
following argument. When a was picked from the budget set A, the alternative b was within
that set, so if the person was choosing rationally then u(a)
3

u(b), where u stands for utility.

Becker (1962) points out that rational choice is not necessary for choices to satisfy the laws of demand.
Aggregate choices may obey the laws of demand even if some individual choices are inconsistent with utility
maximization. Therefore, we expect to be able to provide results about the tradeoffs between prices in the case
that choices occasionally, or even frequently, violate revealed preference tests of rationality.

3

We can strengthen this statement to u(a) > u(b) by using continuity and assuming localnonsatiation, meaning that there is some alternative within any given distance of any bundle
that provides strictly higher utility. Applying the same argument starting with the choice of b
from B implies u(b) > u(a), which is a contradiction. Thus, a person who made these choices
could not have been choosing rationally.
Samuelson (1938a,b), proves that choices which are not irrational by the above test,
i.e. which are consistent with the Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference (WARP), are a
necessary requirement for data that come from maximizing a utility function. The example
above uses only 2 choice sets, allowing direct comparisons. In the experiment conducted in
this paper we collect choices from 10 sets. Therefore we can also test for chains of irrational
choices that involve indirect comparisons, such as when choices reveal that u(a) > u(b) >
u(c) > u(a). Houthakker (1950) showed that choice data which do not reveal these sorts of
intransitivities, that is to say which satisfy the Strong Axiom of Revealed Preference (SARP),
are a necessary condition for rational choice. Varian (1982) further generalized revealed
preference theory to allow indifference curves to have flat spots. His result on the
equivalency of utility maximization and the satisfaction of revealed preference axioms is
known as the Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference (GARP).
These proofs all rely on continuous choice sets. In practice, and in our experiment,
choice sets are discrete. Harbaugh, Krause, and Berry (2001) show that with discrete choice
sets one needs to strengthen the local nonsatiation requirement to strong monotonicity. This
ensures that the discrete alternatives c and d in Figure 1 have higher utility than the choices a
and b respectively. This means that we don’t need continuity to know that choosing a means
u(a) > u(b), because the available alternative d has more of good y and the same amount of x

4

than does b, and so is better by strong monotonicity. Again, we reverse the argument to
show the contradiction, that u(b) > u(a).
Sippel (1997) is the first example of a properly controlled laboratory experiment
applying revealed preference axioms to consumption data. Subjects were asked to choose
among several snacks and time-passing goods, and to pay for these goods using an
endowment of an artificial currency. Choices were made almost simultaneously, and the
“strategy method” was employed, so that one choice was chosen randomly and then
implemented.4 In each of two treatments, nearly half or more subjects had at least one
WARP, SARP, and/or GARP violation. However, the demand analysis supported the view
that subjects did not choose randomly, and typically behaved according to neoclassical
predictions.
Harbaugh, Krause, and Berry (2001) applied the revealed preference test in
consumption experiments with children ages seven to 11, as well as with college
undergraduates. Participants were offered choices among 11 different choice sets, each
bundle consisting of a number of small bags of chips and boxes of juice. Choice sets were
constructed using implicit price and income vectors which formed overlapping budget sets.
They found that about half-to-three-quarters of subjects exhibited at least one violation,
although the average number of violations tended to be relatively small. On average, even
for the youngest children, there were significantly fewer transitivity violations than would be

4

The strategy method involves multiple rounds of the same game, where the experimenter will randomly
choose only one (or perhaps a strict subset) of the rounds to calculate the subjects’ earnings. The strategy
method, which is a common procedure in many experimental settings and also used in this paper, provides an
incentive for subjects to treat each round as a single play of the game, and to maximize expected utility over the
entire random lottery. This may actually mitigate against the problem of changing or evolving preferences
during the experiment.

expected under random choice. These results suggested that even children may be rational
utility maximizers, at least with respect to familiar consumption goods.
Andreoni and Miller (2002) offered individuals opportunities to share an endowment
with another anonymous partner. Implicit prices and incomes were varied across decisions to
create intersecting budget sets, allowing researchers to check for GARP consistency. The
majority of subjects showed altruistic behavior, in varying degrees, and almost half of the
subjects exhibited behavior that was exactly consistent with at least one of the utility
functions estimated, or, equivalently had no GARP violations.
III. Experimental Design
The experiments were conducted in high school math classes in Eugene, Oregon, with
the permission of the school district, principals, and teachers. Following standard
experimental protocols, we provided complete information to the participants, paid them
privately in cash, and there was no deception. Before the experiment, the students read an
assent agreement and allowed to opt out of the experiment, but none did. Because school
attendance rates are high, this procedure provides a fairly representative sample of the area
high school age population. However, the sample is not nationally representative – Eugene is
a medium sized college town with a population that is richer and whiter than the United
States as a whole. Experiments are also conducted with economics and business majors
from two upper-division undergraduate courses at the University of Oregon. These students
differ from the high school students in several dimensions, as will be explained below in
detail.5

5

As Levitt and List (2006) underscore, self-selection of subjects into an experiment may diminish the
generalizability of the results. In our high school experiments there was no self-selection effect, since all the

6

Everyone was given an endowment of money to use in the experiment. The basic
decision is whether or not, and how much of this money to steal from the randomly-assigned
partner (who is anonymous), given specified probabilities of getting caught and specified
fines that must be paid if caught. Everyone made a decision as if they were the criminal, and
we then randomly determined the participants’ actual roles (criminal or victim) within each
pair, for the purpose of determining the payoffs. The subjects knew the other participants.
However, because they were randomly and anonymously matched with a partner, they did
not know who they would steal from, or who stole from them, even after the end of the
experiment.
Subjects made a series of these decisions, each one from different choice set. The
sets were constructed from budgets defined over three goods: stolen loot, the probability of
getting away with the theft, and the amount kept if caught (after paying back the stolen loot,
plus the fine). Each choice set consisted of a list of bundles of these three goods. The
bundles can be thought of as different crimes; that is, some bundles involved taking a little
money, facing a good chance of getting away with it and a modest fine if caught; while
others involved a larger amount of loot, but a lesser chance of getting away with it; and so
on. Taking nothing from the partner is always an option.
The list of bundles for each choice set is constructed with different implicit incomes
and prices. These prices can be viewed as the rates of tradeoff between loot, the probability
of getting away with the theft, and the smallness of the fine if caught. That is, a high implicit
price for loot relative to the price of getting away with it means that, in this particular choice
set, choosing a crime with lots of loot will cost dearly in terms of the chances of getting

students agreed to participate. Selection in terms of being in the classroom was small, because high school
attendance is high. Selection on both counts is more significant with our college sample.

caught. Incomes can be thought of as the overall extent of criminal opportunities available.
A higher income means that, relative to a low income choice set, there are crimes available
that involve not only a lot of loot, but also a low probability of getting away with the crime,
and small fines if caught. In the remainder of the paper we will call this income variable
“opportunity.”
We used two different protocols. Protocol 1 used language such as “person A,”
“person B,” and “take from person B” and provided uniform starting endowments of $5.
Protocol 2 used different budget sets and also used loaded language, such as “criminal,”
“victim” and “steal from the victim.” Additionally, instead of a uniform endowment of $5,
participants were randomly given either $8, $12, or $16. Put differently, in Protocol 2 there
was an explicit emphasis on the dishonest or illegal nature of the act. Also the financial
stakes could be higher in protocol 2. For example, an endowment of $16 is nearly equivalent
to the average weekly spending of a high school student, and it is 1/5th of the weekly
spending for a college student (see Table 2).
Protocol 1 included duplicate choice sets to check for the consistency of choices. To
check for monotonicity of preferences, Protocol 1 included choice bundles that were on the
interior of the budget set, while Protocol 2 included some choice sets constructed using
budget lines that were rays from the origin. The logic behind both tests is to investigate the
extent to which individuals select bundles that are strictly dominated, in the sense of having
less of at least one “good.”
Table 1A presents summary information on the choice sets for both Protocol 1 and
Protocol 2, and Table 1B displays the menu of bundles for a representative choice set from

8

each protocol. As can be seen, the stakes are higher for Protocol 2.6 The complete protocols
are presented in the Appendix.
The opportunities and prices are varied so that the choice sets overlap, with the
intersections of the constraints designed in such a way as to ensure many possibilities for
making intransitive choices. These variations in opportunities and prices also allow us to
estimate demand functions.
The subjects are told that they must choose one bundle from each choice set (like the
ones displayed in Table 1B). After they and their matched partner have made their choices in
all 10 rounds (10 different choice sets),7 we randomly determined who the criminal was, and
who the victim was. Then, one of each criminal’s choice sets (one of the 10 choice sets) was
randomly chosen, and the choice they made from that particular set was implemented. We
used a randomized procedure to determine if they got away with the theft they might have
chosen to commit, or if they were instead caught and had to return any loot to the victim and
also pay the fine. The criminal and the victim were then paid the resulting amounts in cash.
The protocols were designed to make sure that choices are made carefully. First, we
gave the subjects 30 seconds to make a decision on each choice set (to choose a bundle from
6

The null hypothesis for our revealed preference test is that people are rational. Bronars (1987) finds that
power (the probability of not committing a Type II error) is maximized when two-good budgets bisect each
other at arbitrarily small angles (that is, they nearly coincide). The three-good analog is that budget planes
intersect each other such that the area on either side of the intersection is equal in both budgets, and that they
intersect at arbitrarily small angles. In terms of our experimental design, there is a clear tradeoff between
Bronars’ power to detect revealed preference violations and the ability to detect large violations, in the sense of
the Afriat Index. If the choice sets are designed to minimize the chance of a Type II error, we do not present
any opportunities for costly mistakes, so we have little idea about subjects’ likely responses to costlier
mistakes. On the other hand, if we design the choice sets to minimize the chance of a Type I error, we may not
be able to detect any revealed preference violations. While we take maximization of Bronars power as the
starting point for parameter choice, we are forced to relax it to some degree in order to accommodate the other
desirable characteristics, including a balance with the Afriat Index. Andreoni and Harbaugh (2006) discuss
these issues in more detail.
7
Protocol 2 included three additional choice sets constructed from budget lines that were rays from the origin,
so participants made a total of 13 choices in Protocol 2. These additional choice sets were used to examine
monotonicity only, and like the other 10 choice sets, could also have been selected as the choice to be
implemented.

each of the 10 choice sets). We told them not to go on to the next choice set until the 30
seconds were up. We call these 10 choices their “first” choices. For the second choices, we
had them go through the list again, spending a further 15 seconds on each choice set, and
marking any changes they would like to make by crossing out the old and circling the new
decisions.
In Protocol 1 we gave individuals two additional chances to change their minds: First
after the uncertainty was resolved about whether they were the criminal or the victim, and
then again after they were told which choice sheet (from 1 to 10) would count. This
information is used to check whether choices obey the independence axiom, as is explained
in the results section. Protocol 1 also included duplicate budget sets to investigate whether
people were making internally consistent choices. As can be seen in Table 1A, budgets 1 and
5, 3 and 7, and 4 and 8 are the same. In Protocol 2, we do not duplicate any budget sets, nor
do we implement independence checks - the second choice is the final choice in Protocol 2.
Choice sets were always ordered starting with the low income version. In Protocol 1
the order of choices within the choice sets was blocked, with half the participants receiving
forms where the amount of loot that can be taken is ranked from low to high as one goes
down the page (block 1), and the other half of the subjects faced loot amounts that are ranked
from high to low (block 2).
Experiments with Protocol 1 are performed in a total of five high school classes and
one undergraduate class, for a total of 83 high school and 31 college students. The Protocol
2 experiments were conducted in three high school classes and one undergraduate class, for
82 high school students and 34 college students.

10

We collected data on socio-demographic characteristics of the subjects in a postexperiment survey in order to investigate their relationship with the rationality of
participants’ choices.8

Definitions and descriptive statistics of these variables are provided

in Table 2. Oldest Child is a dichotomous variable to indicate if the subject is the oldest (or
only) child in his or her family. Tenure is the number of years the subject has lived in
Oregon. A larger value may be considered as a proxy for enhanced ties to friends and
community, and might be expected to have a negative correlation with stealing. As shown in
Table 2, the college undergraduates have higher GPAs, more money, and are older.
IV. Results
Consistency and Independence
To investigate the consistency of the choices, we analyzed whether subjects made the
same choices when presented with the duplicate choice sets in Protocol 1. There are 114
individuals using Protocol 1, and each person faced 3 pairs of duplicate budget sets (Choice
sets 1 and 5, 3 and 7, and 4 and 8; see table 1A). Thus, we have 342 pairs of duplicate choice
sets. For the first decisions that were made on each choice set, 167 of the 342 pairs (49%)
are the same. For the final decision, 196 of 342 (57%) are the same. The rates of
inconsistent choices are much lower than would be true under the alternative of random
decisions. In addition, the increase in the proportion of consistent choices from round 1 to
round 2 is reassuring as it suggests that thinking about the decision increases consistency.
When we regress the number of matched choices on demographics, nothing is statistically
significant, including whether the subject is a high school student, and the GPA.

8

This survey was not administered to the college students in Protocol 2.

11

To test GARP and to estimate participation and demand equations, we need to argue
that these are the same decisions that would have been made if faced with only one decision
and no uncertainty. This amounts to indicating that choices must obey the independence
axiom.9 In our experiment, independence implies that the chosen bundle should not change
when a person learns his/her role, or when it is revealed which budget set will be
implemented. We find that about 77 percent of participants change at least one choice in
round 2 (21% in Protocol 2), about 17 percent change in round 3, and nobody changes his or
her decision in round 4. We take this as evidence that choice behavior under uncertainty,
which is not resolved until rounds 3 and 4, generally obeys independence.
Protocol differences
As previously noted, there are some differences between Protocol 1 and Protocol 2.
Protocol 1 uses neutral language, while Protocol 2 uses loaded language about crime and
generally larger stakes. Protocol 2 may be less demanding cognitively as it includes fewer
bundles per choice set. The endowments in Protocol 2 vary across individuals. Figure 2
displays the distribution of the number of GARP violations by endowment in Protocol 2. It
appears that there is a slight tendency for those with a larger endowment to have fewer
GARP violations. The Mann-Whitney test confirms that the average number of GARP
violations between those with an $8 endowment (1.97) and a $16 endowment (1.07) is
different at the 5% level. However, the number of GARP violations by those with a $12
endowment (1.66) is not statistically different from the other two groups. The distribution of
the number of non-monotonic choices by endowment is displayed in Figure 3. Mann9

Machina (1987) provides intuition for this axiom, arguing that if people prefer A to B, they should also prefer
a coin-flip between A and C to a coin-flip between B and C. The logic is that if the coin comes up for C, their
choice is irrelevant, but so long as there is some chance it will come up the other way, one gets what one
prefers.

12

Whitney tests demonstrate that there are no statistical differences in monotonic choice by
endowment. The same is true for the amount of stolen loot.
Rationality and Revealed Preference
We check for revealed preference violations using an algorithm from Varian (1995)
which has been modified to handle three goods and discrete bundles. Tests of SARP and
WARP yield comparative results that are very similar to those from GARP, therefore only
results for GARP are reported here. The revealed preference test has no power to detect
irrational behavior if choices are at corners, so we eliminate those subjects who always steal
everything and those who never steal anything from this part of the analysis. Table 3
displays the average number of GARP violations for both high school and college subjects,
and provides a comparison to bootstrap random choice for both protocols. In the bootstrap
random choice, each bundle is weighted by its frequency in the overall choice distribution.
Table 3 demonstrates that each subject group exhibits significantly fewer violations
than would be expected from bootstrap choice. The average number of GARP violations
across all subjects who did not choose at the corners is 4.32 in Protocol 1, and 1.67 in
Protocol 2. In Protocol 1 the average number of violations in round 1 is 4.8 and it is 1.75 in
Protocol 2. This suggests that, on average, the choice modifications made by individuals
move them towards greater rationality. Protocol 2 has a significantly lower number of
bootstrap violations than does Protocol 1, which suggests that in Protocol 2, the ability to
detect violations (in the Bronars’ power sense) is less. However, because the budget sets
intersect at greater angles in Protocol 2, any violations are more serious than they are in
Protocol 1.

13

The fourth column of Table 3 reports average GARP violations for those subjects
who did not choose corner bundles in each and every choice set, and who have at least 8 (out
of a possible 10) monotonic choices in Protocol 1, or at least 2 monotonic choices (out of a
possible 3) in Protocol 2. There are 36 such high school participants and 12 college student
participants in Protocol 1, and 67 high school participants and 31 college student participants
in Protocol 2. Table 3 demonstrates that in Protocol 1 average GARP violations drop
significantly when individuals with non-monotonic choices are excluded. In Protocol 2
average GARP violations for college students is about the same, but it increases slightly for
high school students. In each case the average number of violations is still significantly less
than with bootstrap choices.
Table 3 also presents the calculated Afriat Index (Afriat, 1972) for each sub-sample.
The Afriat Index provides a measure of efficiency relative to perfectly rational choice. One
minus the Afriat Index can be interpreted as the proportion of income wasted through
irrational choice.10 The indices for each protocol and subgroup are quite close to one,
indicating that most violations are trivial in magnitude.
Figure 4 presents frequencies for the number of GARP violations per subject. Note
that, since a minimum of two choices are required to check for a rationality violation, it is
impossible to have just one violation. About 40 percent of the subjects have no GARP
violations in Protocol 1, and 54 percent have no GARP violations in Protocol 2.
There is no obvious standard against which to compare the number of GARP
violations. The revealed preference theorems described above require that choices obey the
axioms without exception. In practice, this standard is seldom met. Sippel (1997) used a
10

However, with our design this interpretation is not strictly true, since we use discrete rather than continuous
choices.

14

similar protocol for eight different consumption goods, using 10 different budget sets. He
found that 24 of 42 participants violated GARP at least twice. Andreoni and Miller (2002)
examined 142 college students’ decisions about how much money to keep for themselves and
how much to share with another, under eight different budget constraints. They found that
nine percent of the participants committed at least some violations of the revealed preference
axioms. Harbaugh, Krause, and Berry (2001) looked at decisions over two consumption
goods and 11 choice sets. Eleven-year-olds and college students had similar patterns, with
about 35 percent displaying GARP violations. The average number of violations was about
two. The task in our experiment is more difficult, in terms of the number of goods, than that
in the Andreoni and Miller (2002) or Harbaugh, Krause, and Berry (2001) experiments, but
simpler than that of Sippel (1997). Although a direct comparison cannot be made, our results
seem generally consistent with those from other experiments.
As in Harbaugh, Krause, and Berry (2001) and Andreoni and Miller (2002), our
revealed preference test requires that preferences be strongly monotonic. Rather than take
this on faith, our experiment is designed to test this assumption. This is accomplished by
including to the choice sets of Protocol 1 dominated bundles – that is, bundles with
simultaneously lower loot and/or higher probabilities of detection and fine than other options
in the choice set.
Table 4 gives the frequencies for the number of monotone choices for our sample
from Protocol 1, and compares this to what would occur with random selection using a
Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 sets of uniform draws from our choice sets. The
average number of monotone choices is 7.0, and 46 percent of our 114 participants made

15

eight or more monotone choices. In comparison, 17 percent have 8 or more monotone
choices in the Monte Carlo simulation.
To test for monotonicity in Protocol 2, we included three upward sloping budget sets,
as in Andreoni and Miller (2002). A subject with monotonic preferences would choose the
bundle at the very top of the budget line. In this protocol only 20 percent of our subjects
made any non-monotonic choices and only 3 percent made the maximum of 3 nonmonotonic choices. It is important to note that non-monotonic preferences are not
necessarily irrational, and can be explained by fairness models.11 For example, “otherregarding” preferences may lead a subject to steal less from an anonymous classmate than
pure self-interest would dictate.
Sippel (1997) reported that most of his participants spent their entire budget, and
those who did not, came very close to spending it all. Harbaugh, Krause, and Berry (2001)
assumed monotonicity, and did not include any procedure for testing it. Andreoni and Miller
(2002) had a larger percentage of monotonic choices (88%) than we find. Our experiment
involved a significantly greater number of alternatives, and our monotonicity test was
integrated into each budget set for Protocol 1, while the Andreoni paper constructed separate
budget sets specifically for the purpose of testing for monotonicity. It seems likely that
Andreoni’s procedure makes the non-monotonic choices more obvious and less likely to be
chosen. Our results from Protocol 2 appear to be consistent with those of the Andreoni
paper.
Because the data are discrete and cardinal, we estimate count data models in an
attempt to explain the number of GARP violations using the socio-demographic variables.

college students by the dichotomous variable “High School”. The second column presents

variables are interacted with the High School dummy. Because socio-demographic data were
not collected on the college students for Protocol 2, one cannot identify the differential
impact of personal characteristics on GARP violations between college and high school
students using Protocol 2.
Column 3 of Table 5 indicates that, among college students, being one year older is
associated with about a half fewer GARP violations. Having lived longer in Eugene has a
smaller effect in magnate on GARP violations. It appears that being the oldest child in the
family is associated with fewer GARP violations. A general conclusion from Table 5,
however, is that the degree of rationality of behavior is not well explained by the available
personal background characteristics of the subjects.
Crime and deterrence
In this section we investigate the determinants of individuals’ specific decisions
regarding whether or not to steal, and the amount of money stolen. As Levitt and List (2006)
describe, individuals’ utility maximization may also involve concerns about “doing the right
thing” or “moral choices.” In our setting, this aspect of the behavior may be exacerbated
even though there is complete anonymity between the partners, because the subjects are
classmates. Thus, not surprisingly, there is evidence that individuals do not simply treat the

17

experiment as a chance to maximize expected value or expected utility. In Protocol 1, the
average expected value (EV) for the sample is 91% of the maximum possible EV, while for
Protocol 2 it is 74%. For expected utility (EU), a simple CARA utility function, u = x ,
where x is the endowment adjusted by loot or the fine, gives very similar results even when
is as low as 0.6. These averages mask a large degree of heterogeneity – some people take
less than the amount that maximizes EV or EU, while others take more.
The hypothesis that people will not steal from others has no support. Table 6 presents
the distribution of the number of thefts. During the experiment each individual had the
opportunity to steal 10 times (ignoring the monotonicity checks in Protocol 2). Thus, in
Table 6, zero thefts means that the individual never stole during the experiment, and a 10
indicates that he or she stole money in every round. As Table 6 demonstrates, there is
substantial variation in the number of thefts. Forty-nine percent of the subjects stole some
amount in every round of Protocol 1, and 52 percent did the same in Protocol 2.
Given these results, demand functions for stolen money can be estimated to
investigate the determinants of the amount of loot stolen as a function of the personal
characteristics of the person who steals, and the characteristics of the choice set. If people
are choosing rationally, then we would expect them to respond to the changes in implicit
prices in ways that are consistent with the laws of demand. For example, we would expect
that participants will respond to an increase in the cost of choosing a crime with high loot (in
the sense of a change in constraints, which makes such crimes involve a higher probability of
detection, or a higher fine) by tending to move toward crimes with less loot, but also lower
probabilities of detection and/or lower fines. An increase in available criminal opportunities
– that is, a change in the constraint which allows people to take more loot, at less risk of

18

detection, and a lower fine, would also be expected to increase loot, assuming loot is a
normal good.
We normalize the implicit prices by dividing through by the price of detection and
eliminating that price from the regressions. We expect to find negative own-price effects (an
increase in the cost of taking loot --in the sense of having to accept higher probabilities of
detection and higher fines-- should reduce the amount taken), and a positive cross-price
effect (an increase in the “fine-discount” should cause people to take more loot).
The decision of how much to steal can be thought of as consisting of two steps. The
first part is the decision whether or not to steal (participation), and the second part is the
decision of how much to steal, conditional on the decision to steal. This process resembles
the one typically used to model decisions about cigarette smoking or alcohol consumption
(e.g. Gruber and Zinman 2001; Farrell, Manning and Finch 2003). The motivation for this
approach is that it allows for variables to have different effects on the decision as to steal, and
the decision about how much to steal. Alternatively, one can estimate an unconditional
demand function for loot using all observations (those who steal and those who do not).
Tables 7A-7D present the results of the estimated unconditional demand,
participation, and conditional demand equations separately for the two protocols, and for
high school students and college students. Unconditional demand is estimated as a Tobit
(individuals can steal, but not give). In the participation equations, the dependent variable is
dichotomous to indicate if the subject stole money in that particular round. Participation
equations are estimated as logits and also as linear probability models with personal
attributes. The demand for loot is estimated with OLS, including personal background
variables. The control variables included in the regressions may not adequately capture

19

unobserved individual heterogeneity that might be correlated with the propensity to steal.
Thus, both participation and loot demand equations are also estimated with individual fixedeffects to control for such unobservables. The key variables of interest are the loot price, fine
price, and opportunity. The manner is which individual heterogeneity is controlled for
should have no impact on the estimated coefficients of these variables because they are
exogenous by design. Standard errors are adjusted for clustering at the individual level. In
Protocol 2 no personal information was collected from college students. Therefore the
regressions that employ data on college students from Protocol 2 do not include personal
characteristics.
The estimated participation equations in Table 7A show that, for high school students
and for the unloaded language (Protocol 1), the propensity to steal increases with age, but it
is otherwise unrelated to other explanatory variables. Unconditional demand estimates reveal
that an increase in the loot price generates a decrease in the amount of loot taken. The loot
price is estimated with less precision in the unconditional demand equation estimated by
tobit, but in this equation in addition to the age effect, height has a positive impact on the
demand for stolen loot. Being the oldest child in the family, on the other hand, is negatively
related to unconditional demand for stolen money.
These results are generally consistent with those obtained from college students in
Protocol 1, reported in Table 7B. Own-price effect (the price of loot) is negative and
statistically significant in both unconditional demand and conditional demand equations.
Among college students, the number of years lived in Eugene, Oregon (Tenure), and the
GPA are negatively related to both the propensity to steal and amount of the stolen money.

20

On the other hand, an increase in the amount of money the individual spends per week
(Money) is positively related to the demand for stolen loot.
For Protocol 2, which uses the loaded language and different choice sets, we find
much stronger evidence of responsiveness to prices across all decisions, for both the high
school and college samples. For example, loot price is negative and significant and fine price
is positive and significant in all models in Table 7C (high school sample). The same is true
for college students, reported in Table 7D. In addition, the coefficients of opportunity are
also positive and significant in all equations, indicating that larger opportunity sets for crime
(i.e. when crime is associated with a lower probability of detection, and lower fines) generate
higher propensity to steal and larger amounts of stolen money. We do not have data on
personal characteristics of college students in Protocol 2, but male high school students have
a higher propensity to steal.
These results underline two points. First, as predicted by economic theory, the
subjects’ decisions regarding whether to steal and how much to steal are, in general,
responsive to the variations in tradeoffs, and sometimes, though not always, to the
availability of criminal opportunities. Second, these responses are larger in Protocol 2, which
uses the more direct language. Inclusion or exclusion of personal background characteristics
does little to influence the estimated parameters, and neither does the inclusion of individual
fixed-effects. This is not surprising as the prices and criminal opportunity are exogenous by
construction.
Table 8 reports the impact of the variation in prices and criminal opportunity on the
decision to steal and the demand for loot from a different perspective. Using Tables7A-7D,
the elasticities for prices and for criminal opportunity are calculated for both participation

21

equation and demand for loot. Elasticities are calculated using the OLS estimates for
participation and conditional demand equations in all sub samples except for Protocol 2
college students, where the Fixed Effects estimates are used (OLS estimates are virtually
identical).
Table 8 shows that an increase in the price of loot always results in a decrease in the
amount of stealing, for both protocols and for both high school and college students. In
Protocol 1 this response seems to be driven by the reaction of the conditional demand
equation, whereas in Protocol 2 both the participation and unconditional demand functions
are responsive to the variation in the loot price.12
The response to a change in loot price among those who steal (the conditional
demand) is about twice as large in Protocol 2 than in Protocol 1. This difference in the
responsiveness can be seen in the “fine price” as well. The subjects in Protocol 1 do not
change their behavior as fine price changes, while the participants in Protocol 2 consistently
increase the amount that they steal from others as the fines for stealing decrease.
The higher degree of responsiveness in Protocol 2 also shows up in the opportunity
elasticity. This should be thought of as the degree to which general increases in the
attractiveness of crime prompt increases in participation and the amounts of money stolen.
The elasticity of criminal opportunity is statistical significance only in the college
participants in Protocol 2. The finding that responsiveness in Protocol 2 is greater is
consistent with the fact that revealed preference violations in Protocol 2 are more costly than
in Protocol 1.

12

The unconditional demand function elasticities can alternatively be calculated as the sum of elasticities
obtained from the participation and conditional demand equations. As can be seen in Table 8, elasticities that
can be calculated this way would be very similar in magnitude to those obtained from estimating the
unconditional demand equations.

22

The elasticities reported in Table 8 do not have real-world counterparts. This is not
critical because the aim of this study is not to provide parameters that could be used for
policy. Rather, the goal is to investigate the extent to which individuals respond to variations
in the costs of criminal activity, and whether or not these responses are consistent with the
economic theory of criminal behavior.
V. Discussion and Conclusion
The extent to which criminals and potential criminals respond to variations in
deterrence is an important issue, both theoretically and from a public policy perspective.
Despite significant progress in recent empirical analyses in identifying the causal effect of
deterrence on crime, objections are still raised on the validity of methods proposed to
eliminate the simultaneity between crime and deterrence in empirical analyses. The issue is
important because it involves fundamental arguments about the rationality of individuals in
their decisions to engage in illegal acts and whether individuals respond to changes in the
costs of crime, such as the probability of punishment and the penalty they face, if caught.
This is the first paper where individuals’ responses to potential criminal opportunities
and the associated costs are analyzed in an experimental setting. We design an experiment
where subjects are exposed to exogenous variations in the relative tradeoffs between three
important aspects of criminal opportunities – the amount of loot they can take from another
person, the probability of detection, and the fine. We conducted the experiment with
juveniles and young adults, age groups that are near the peak ages for participation in petty
crime and who are frequently labeled as “irrational” and “unresponsive to deterrence.”
We find that behavior among this group with respect to petty criminal decisions is not
completely rational. However, it is approximately as consistent with the theoretical

23

requirements of rational choice behavior as are the choice behaviors for consumption goods.
Furthermore, we find that, in aggregate, responses to changes in criminal opportunities are
consistent with the laws of demand. Our estimates indicate that both participation in crime
and the amount of loot stolen respond to exogenous variations in relative prices, with the
response of the demand for loot being stronger.
Caveats are that the participants in these experiments are not necessarily criminals
outside the laboratory, and that the crimes do not involve very large financial gains and
losses. It should be noted, however, that recent evidence indicates that criminals respond to
variations in penalties in the same manner as non-criminals. For example, Bar-Ilan and
Sacerdote (2004) show that drivers who were previously indicted for property or violent
crimes have the same elasticity of traffic violations (red-light running) with respect to the
fine, as those who do not have a criminal record. Given these qualifications, these results
demonstrate that individuals’ decisions to commit crime are consistent with the predictions
obtained from economic models, in that exogenous changes in enforcement and penalties do
alter criminal behavior.

Appendix A – Protocol 1
Welcome:
Today we are conducting an experiment about decision-making. Your decisions are for real
money, so pay careful attention to these instructions. This money comes from a research
foundation. How much you earn will depend on the decisions that you make, and on chance.
Secrecy:
All your decisions will be secret and we will never reveal them to anyone. We will ask you to
mark your decisions on paper forms using a black pen or pencil. If you are discovered looking at
another person’s forms, or showing your form to another person, we cannot use your decisions in
our study and so you will not get paid. Please do not talk during the experiment.
Payment:
Stapled to this page is a card with a number on it. This is your claim check number. Each
participant has a different number. Please tear off your card now and write your claim check
number on the line on the first page. You are also given a packet. Write your claim check
number on top of the first page of that packet, but do not turn the page until instructed to do so.
Be sure to keep your claim check number. You will present this number to an assistant at the
end of the experiment and you will be given your payment envelope.
The Experiment:
You are going to play a game today. In this game there will be two roles – A and B. Everyone
will be randomly assigned one role, and will be matched with another person with the other role.
You will not be told who you are paired with, and they will not be told who they are paired with,
even after the experiment is over.
Person A will start with $5, and person B will also start with $5. Person A will have a chance to
take some of person B’s money. Taking is not without a risk. After person A makes the
decision to take or not to take, there will be a “discovery” phase. During this phase there is a
chance that person A will have to return the money taken from person B, and also pay some
money to the experimenter. The chance that this happens, and the amount paid to the
experimenter if it does, depend on the choice made by person A.
Everyone received one packet, and each packet contains 10 different sheets stapled together. We
will show you an example. We call these Choice Sheets.
On each Choice Sheet you will make a choice as if you are person A. You will declare your
choice of how much money to take from person B by putting a check mark next to one of the
choices with a black pen or pencil.

44

When we play the game the amount of money you will end up with will really be determined by
the choices you make, so you want to consider your choice very carefully. We will give you 60
seconds on the first page and 30 seconds on each subsequent page. Please leave your pencil or
black pen on the desk and do not mark your choice until I ask you to do so. When the time is up
I will ask you to place a check mark using a pencil next to the choice you want. It is important
that you wait until the time is up to mark your choice.
After we go over all 10 Choice Sheets and everyone has made all 10 choices, I will give you a
chance to change your mind. This time you will have 15 seconds on each page. Please leave
your pencil or black pen on the desk and do not mark your choice until I ask you to do so. To
change your choice, clearly cross out (do not erase) your previous choice, and place a check
mark next to the choice you want.
Next, we randomly assign roles of A or B by flipping a coin. If it comes up heads, then those
whose claim check number is even will be assigned the role of person A, and those whose claim
check number is odd will be assigned the role of person B. Should the coin come up tails, then
those whose claim check number is odd will be assigned the role of person A, and those whose
claim check number is even will be assigned the role of person B.
Now we have to pick which one of the 10 Choice Sheets will count. We will pick a random
number from 1 to 10, by having your teacher draw a card from a deck of 10 cards. The Ace will
stand for 1. The number of the card will determine which Choice Sheet counts. We will have
you turn your packet to that choice sheet.
Then we must complete the discovery phase to see if person A will have to return the money to
person B and pay some money to the experimenter. Here is how this will work: We have 5
index cards. On each index card there is a percentage written. They are: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%
and 100%. We will randomly choose one of these index cards. Everybody looks at their choice
on the Choice Sheet that has just been selected. If you are person A, and if the percentage
written on the selected index card is less than the chance of being discovered for the choice you
made on the Choice Sheet, then you are discovered. You will have to return the money you took
from person B and pay to the experimenter the number of money indicated in the choice.
Otherwise you keep the money.
We will collect odd numbered and even numbered packets in separate stacks. Then we will mix
up each stack , and take one from each stack to match people together. The choice made on
person A’s Choice Sheet will be used to determine their payments.
We will proceed through the stacks until we are done. If there is an odd number of people in the
room, then at the end there will be one packet left over. This packet will be assigned the role of
person A, and will be paid according to the decision on his or her choice sheet.
Note that you don’t know which of your 10 decisions will count, if any. This will be determined
purely by chance. So the best thing for you do to is to treat every choice sheet as if it will count,
and make the choice on that sheet that you most prefer.

Appendix A – Protocol 2
Welcome:
Today we are conducting an experiment about decision-making. Your decisions are for real
money, so pay careful attention to these instructions. This money comes from a research
foundation. How much you earn will depend on the decisions that you make, the decisions of
others, and on chance.
Secrecy:
All your decisions will be secret and we will never reveal them to anyone. We will ask you to
mark your decisions on paper forms using a pen or pencil. If you are discovered looking at
another person’s forms, or showing your form to another person, we cannot use your decisions in
our study and so you will not get paid. Please do not talk during the experiment.
Payment:
You have been given a packet. Stapled to this packet is a card with a number on it. This is your
claim check number. Each participant has a different number. Please tear off your card now.
Be sure that your claim check number is written on top of the first page of your packet, but do
not turn the page until instructed to do so. Be sure to keep your claim check number. You will
present this number to an assistant in exchange for your payment envelope.
The Experiment:
You are going to play a game today. In this game you will be randomly and anonymously paired
with another person in the room. One of you will be the criminal, and the other will be the
victim. You will not know who you are paired with, even after the game is over.
Each person will start with some money, but the amount of money each person gets may be
different. You will start with either $16, $12, or $8. Your starting endowment has been
determined randomly. The amount you start with is recorded on your packet.
The criminal will have a chance to steal some of the victim’s money. However, stealing is not
without a risk. If the criminal decides to steal some of the victim’s money, there is a chance that
the criminal is caught. If the criminal is caught, then he or she will have to return the money
taken from the victim, and also pay a fine to the experimenter. The chance that the criminal is
caught, and the amount of the fine, depend on the choice made by the criminal.
Everyone received one packet, and each packet contains 13 different sheets stapled together. We
will show you an example. We call these Choice Sheets.
On each Choice Sheet everyone will make a choice as if you are the criminal. You will declare
your choice of how much money to steal from the victim by putting a check mark next to one of
the choices.

When we play the game the amount of money you will end up with will really be determined by
the choices you make, so you want to consider your choice very carefully. We will give you 60
seconds on the first page and 30 seconds on each subsequent page. Please leave your pen on the
desk and do not mark your choice until I ask you to do so. When the time is up I will ask you to
place a check mark next to the choice you want. It is important that you wait until the time is up
to mark your choice.
After everyone has made a choice on each of the 13 Choice Sheets, you will have a chance to
reconsider each of your decisions just to make sure you have considered each choice carefully.
If you wish to change your decision, please cross out your old decision and mark your new
decision with a red pen. We will give you 30 seconds on the first page and 15 seconds on each
subsequent page. Please leave your pen on the desk and do not mark your choice until I ask you
to do so. When the time is up I will ask you to place a check mark next to the choice you want.
It is important that you wait until the time is up to mark your choice.
Next we have to determine who will be the criminal and who will be the victim. We randomly
assign roles by flipping a coin. If it comes up heads, then those whose claim check number is
even will be assigned the role of the criminal, and those whose claim check number is odd will
be assigned the role of the victim. Should the coin come up tails, then those whose claim check
number is odd will be assigned the role of the criminal, and those whose claim check number is
even will be assigned the role of the victim.
Now we have to pick which one of the 13 Choice Sheets will count. We will pick a random
number from 1 to 13, by having your teacher draw a card from a deck of 13 cards. The Ace will
stand for 1, the Jack, Queen, and King will stand for 11, 12, and 13 respectively. The number of
the card will determine which Choice Sheet counts. We will have you turn your packet to that
choice sheet.
Note that you don’t know which of your 13 decisions will count before you make all of your
decisions, if any. This will be determined purely by chance. So, the best thing for you to do is to
treat every choice sheet as if it will count, and make the choice on that sheet that you most
prefer.
In the final step of the game we have to determine whether or not the criminal is caught. Here is
how this will work: We have 4 index cards. On each index card there is a percentage written.
They are: 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%. We will randomly choose one of these index cards.
Everybody looks at their choice on the Choice Sheet that has just been selected. If you are the
criminal, and if the percentage written on the selected index card is less than or equal to the
chance of being caught for the choice you made on the Choice Sheet, then you are caught. You
will have to return the money you stole from the victim and pay the corresponding fine to the
experimenter. Otherwise you keep the money.
Now we will collect your decision packets and calculate your payments. To calculate your
payments, we will randomly match one criminal with one victim. To get your envelope, we will
ask you to fill out a receipt to be returned to us.
