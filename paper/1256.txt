Occupation, Race, Unemployment and Crime
In a Dynamic System

ABSTRACT

this paper, the relationship between unemployment and property
crime is investigated in the context of dynamic system by using quarterly
In

time series data for the United States during the period of 1973 (I) —
1981 (iv)

The results of Granger's causality tests indicate that unemployment
by occupation (white and blue collars) is significantly associated with

robbery, which is the most serious property crime. Unemployment by
race (white, black, and Hispanic) also supports the above finding. In
general, the linkage between

unemployment rate and property crime seems

to become stronger as the degree of seriousness of crime increases.
The findings of the dynamic system show that blue collar, Hispanic, and
black unemployment rates have persistently positive effects on robbery.
Therefore, these above findings suggest that any attempt to reduce
property

be

crime through alleviation of unemployment would most efficiently

directed towards specific categories of the labor force.

OCCUPATION, RACE, UNEMPLOYMENT AND CRIME
IN A DYNAMIC SYSTEM

Michael Massourakis*,

Tadashi Yamada***

In the 1960s, economists1 attempted for the first time
to explain property crime2 as the outcome of economic behavior

on the part of the individual. Being a rational economic agent,
the criminal is in a position to evaluate relative prices reflecting
costs and benefits of various legal and illegal activities and,

thus, to choose an optimum utility—maximizing "basket." Since
then, economic incentives and disincentives have been emphasized
as policy tools in fighting crime as opposed to rehabilitation
which is the main concern of other social scientists.
In the last two decades, a considerable amount of theoretical
analysis and empirical investigation has been done on the relationship

between unemployment and crime. A review of the literature can
be found in Freeman (1982), Long and Witte (1981), and Thompson
et al. (1981) .

The main focus of those studies has been to explore

the effects of employment opportunities on property crime, even
though other socio—economic variables were included in an attempt to
ensure proper model specification.

The unemployment has the expected impact on property crime

more or less consistently across all time—series studies though
the consensus is weaker with respect to the findings of cross—
sectional studies (Freeman 1982) .

A careful evaluation of these

—2—

studies reveals that, despite the high plausibility of the claim
that unemployment may be the key factor behind property-related
criminal activity, only a moderate link between unemployment and
property crime exists.4 A major methodological problem of these
approaches has been the use of a static rather than a dynamic model.
The advantage of the latter is that it may show not only the correlation
but also the duration of lagged effects of unemployment on property
crime.

In this paper, dynamic time—series techniques developed by

Granger (1969) and Sims (1980) are employed. Because of high
expected collinearity between time and some economic variables, and
limited degrees of freedom, the unemployment rate is adopted as
the only explanatory variable in addition to the lagged dependent

variable. The following relationships are investigated in this
study: First, total unemployment and property crime (total and each
kind of property crime separately) ; second, unemployment rates by

occupation (white and blue collars) and different kinds of property
crime; and third, race—specific unemployment rates (white, black,

Hispanic) and various categories of property crime. The period of
analysis extends from the first quarter of 1973 to the fourth quarter

of 1981. The relative crime rates for the United States used in
this paper are the ones released in the 1982 uniform Crime Reports

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.5 Data on unemployment rates

—3—

are collected from unpublished records of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics.

Section I describes the statistical techniques involved
in the Granger's causality test and the dynamic representation

of a system. Section II reports the empirical results. Finally,
section III gives a summary of the findings of this paper.

I. STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES OF CAUSALITY TEST AND DYNAMIC SYSTEM
Granger (1969) defines causality between two stationary stochastic
time series, U(t) and X(t) ,

within

a set of information in the

universe, as follows: A time series U causes another time series X
if the current value of X is more accurately predicted by using

the information which includes at least the own—past series of X
and the past series of U, than by using the information which
excludes the past series of U.6
By using a logarithmic specification, we estimate the following
linear model:

=

(s)X.(t-s)

+

+

Eb.(s)U.(t-s)

4

+

-'

Dk

+ d T,

(1)

-A'

where a3, ai b1 ckt and d are least—square estimates;
x. represents proprety crime while U represents unemployment rate;

are quarterly dumy variables; and T is a linear time trend.

In order to identify the Granger's causality from U to X
in equation (1) ,
(s) ,

s=l,. .. ,n,

from U1 to

the

null hypothesis is that the set of parameters

should be zero if there is no Granger's causality

—5—

With respect to dynamic relationships between
in equation (1) ,

the

and

estimated coefficients on successive lags

include complicated cross—equation feedback and, therefore,

the summing of distributed lagged coefficients, e.g., the sum of
b.(t—s), s=J.,...,n, is quite misleading (Sins 1980). As suggested,
J

8

we estimate the moving average representation (MAR) of the system.

Let t(t) represent the best linear forecast of Z(t) based
on its past series Z(t—s) ,

s>

0, where Z(t) is an q x 1 vector

stationary stochastic time series. Then, the innovation in ZR)
is defined as follows:

v(t)

=

ZR)

—

-S.

ZR),

(2)

where V(t) is serially uncorrelated and is also a linear combination

of current and past values of ZR) for all t. Then, Z(t) can be
expressed asa linear combination of current and past innovations
V(t—s) ,

s> 0.

However, if components of V are contemporaneously

correlated, it is not possible topartition the variance of Z into
components accounted for by each innovation. Therefore,
an orthogonalizing transformation to V is required to obtain
the identity matrix M(t) = T

V(t) ,

where T is a lower triangular

matrix with zero elements above the diagonal, and which makes
the covariance matrix 14(t) the identity matrix. The final equation
to estimate is as follows:

—6—

Z(t) =

F(s)T M(t-s).

.

(3)

The components of the matrix function F(s)T1 represent
the k+1 step—ahead forecast z, accounted for by the innovation
in

(Eckstein et al. 1981) .

Then, a particular i—th equation

of Z(t) is expressed as follows:

f.(s)

zi =

where

M.(t-s),

(4)

is the i—th equation's components of F(s)T1 for

j=1,... ,q; and M's are the normalized innovations in variables

in the system. In particular, the sum of

from stO to s=k

for the j—th component represents the part of error variance
in the k=l step-ahead forecast of Z.., accounted for by

the innovation in

at s=O (Eckstein et al. 1981) .

Consequently,

the proportion of k quarters ahead forecast error variance in
due to typical random shocks of one standard deviation in
the innovation Z. is expressed as follows 9;

II. EMPIRICAL RESULTS
11—1. Granger's Causality Tests
Granger's causality tests for property crimes and unemployment

rates are performed using quarterly time series data for the United
States during the period of 1973(I) —

l9Sl(IV).

The F—statistics

of the results of four lag distributions in a logarithmic
specification are reported in Tables 1 through 3.
Summarizing the empirical evidence, the following observations

emerge. First, our results largely support the significance of
the lag distributions of each property crime in the determination

of its own behavior. Second, total unemployment is shown to
Granger—cause total property crime and robbery, burglary and
motor vehicle theft in particular, at various significance levels.

Third, white collar and blue collar unemployment are both significant
in affecting robbery whereas Granger's causality could not be
detected with respect to other types of property crime with
the exception of motor vehicle theft where the impact of blue

collar unemployment appears stronger. Fourth, unemployment by
race—specific group is significant in Granger—causing robbery

leaving other property crimes unaffected. Fifth, black and
Hispanic unemployment seem to exert a stronger influence on

robbery than white unemployment. And, sixth, black unemployment
is the only type of unemployment significantly shown to
Granger—cause burglary besides robbery.

—8—

The general picture emerging out of these results seems

to indicate that Granger's causality between unemployment and
property crime becomes stronger as the degree of seriousness of
the crime increases and as the incidence of unemployment
discriminates against blue collar, and non—white groups.

11—2. Dynamic Relationships between Robbery and Unemployment

In the Granger's causality tests, we concluded that serious
property crimes are most likely to be related to unemplyment,

while the relationship between unemployment and less serious

property crimes appears rather weak. Therefore, in this section,
only robbery, being the most serious property crime, has been
investigated in its relationship to unemployment categorized
by occupation and race.

Responses of robbery to positive random shocks of one
standard deviation in the innovation in blue collar unemployment
are shown in chart 4 — A.

The innovation in blue collar has

persistently positive effects on the robbery variable at all
quarters except the third quarter (k3) .

As the chart indicates,

an increase in blue collar unemployment does not increase robbery

much during the first year (k=l through 4). However, the effects
of blue collar unemployment on robbery become stronger during

the second year. On the contrary, the responses of robbery to
typical random shocks in the innovation in white collar unemployment
are not positive at all quarters except the second, third, and
fourth quarters, shown in chart 4 — B.

The charts in Table 5 present the responses of robbery to

Hispanic, black, and white unemployments. In chart 5 — A,
the innovation in Hispanic unemployment generates positive effects

— 12 —

on the robbery variable. The peak of robbery is reached in

the middle of the first year. The responses of robbery to
black unemployment follow the similar pattern to those described
for Hispanic unemployment (chart 5 —

B).

Again, the innovation

in white unemployment does not show positive effects on
the robbery variable (chart 5 — C).
Table 6 reports the results of dynamic relationships
between property crime and total unemployment rate, which show
the percentage of error variance of the dependent variable
(total and each property crime) accounted for by the innovation
in total unemployment rate (TU).
In Table 6 -

1, the total property crime (TPC) in the United

States has 37 percent of its variance accounted for by total
unemployment rate in the first quarter, 50 percent in the fourth

quarter, and 60 percent in the seventh quarter. As more future
quarters are forecasted, the variance of total property crime
tends to be explained more by the total unemployment rate.

The results.for each property crime treated separately in Tables
6 —

2

through 6 -

S

reveal the same pattern as explained for

the total property crime in Table 6 — 1.

Therefore, the results

of Table 6 indicate that the total unemployment rate is a strong

determinant of the fluctuations of property crime in the long run.

— 13 —

To summarize, there exist dynamic relationships between

property crime and unemployment rate. Above all, blue collar,
Hispanic, and black unemployment rates show significantly positive

effects on robbery. On the other hand, white collar and white
unemployment rates do not show positive effects on robbery.

Thus, the average overall unemployment rate hides the existing
differences with respect to the impact of unemployment suffered
by specific groups on property crime and robbery in particular.
One might argue that it is not unemployment per se which causes
property crime to increase, but rather the prolonged structural
unemployment that hits blue collar, Hispanic, and black workers

in general. However, persistently high unemployment rates for
these groups may weaken the legitimacy of legal earning activities
and consequently push these people towards economic crime.
On the other hand, the duration and frequency of unemployment
among white collar and white workers are small in general and,
therefore, these people are less likely to get involved in
economic criminal activities.

SUMMARY

The purpose of this study has been first to investigate

the relationship between the property crime rate and the
unemployment rate in the United States, and then to find
dynamic correlations which might exist between these variables.
The results of Granger's causality tests indicate that
unemployment by occupation (white and blue collars) is

significantly associated with robbery. Unemployment by race
(white, black, and Hispanic) also supports the above finding.

In general, the linkage between unemployment rate and property
crime seems to become stronger as the degree of seriousness

of cirme increases. The findings of the dynamic system show
that blue, Hispanic, and black unemployment rates have significantly
positive effects on serious property crimes, i.e., robbery.

As a concluding remark, unemployment rates are important

for the determination of property crime. It is unemployment
in specific groups in the society which is crime-related.
Therefore, any attempt to reduce crime through alleviation of
unemployment

would most efficiently be directed towards specific categories

of the labor force (blue, black, and Hispanic workers).

their helpful comments on a draft of this paper. All errors

'Here one should mention the pioneering work of Ehrlich (1973,
1974) and the path—breaking innovations in economic analysis
of Becker (1968) .

2Property crime is a general term referring to robbery,
burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft.

For example, Ehrlich (1973) uses the following variables:
a) Economic variables
i. legal and illegal income opportunities.
ii. expected cost of punishment.
b) Demographic variables
i. percentage of males aged 14—24 in the population.
ii. percentage of nonwhites in the population.
iii. percentage of population in Standard Metropolitan
Statistical Areas (SMSA5)
4flowever, Phillips, Votey, and Maxwell (1972) found
relatively large R—squares in their equations. Therefpre,
they concluded that changing labor market opportunities are
sufficient to explain increasing crime rates in the United States.

5The relative crime rate is obtained by setting the crime
rate in the first quarter of 1972 equal to 100 as a base in
the 1982 Uniform Crime Reports.
6"Causality" in Granger's model means "linear causality
between variables within a given set of information in a universe."
See Granger (1969), p.430. Blinder (1982) states that T'Granger—
causation has nothing to do with causation in the usual sense...
It means that X adds to the ability to predict Y, no more and
no less Cpp.15—16)."

7The assumptions of the linearity between X(t) and Uk),
and the set of information consisting of X(t) and UCt) would
give spurious results.of the Granger's causality tests,, if
there is a third variable which is causally and linearly
related with X(t) and Uk) but being not included in the set of
information.

1980) and Eckstein et al. (1981).
