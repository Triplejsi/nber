Baby Boomer Retirement Security: the Roles of Planning, Financial Literacy, and Housing
Wealth

NBER Working Paper No. 12585
October 2006
JEL No. D91,E21
ABSTRACT
We compare wealth holdings across two cohorts of the Health and Retirement Study: the early Baby
Boomers in 2004, and individuals in the same age group in 1992. Levels and patterns of total net worth
have changed relatively little over time, though Boomers rely more on housing equity than their predecessors.
Most important, planners in both cohorts arrive close to retirement with much higher wealth levels
and display higher financial literacy than non-planners. Instrumental variables estimates show that
planning behavior can explain the differences in savings and why some people arrive close to retirement
with very little or no wealth.

1. Introduction
The standard economic model of wealth accumulation posits that consumption
decisions are made in a life-cycle framework, where consumption-smoothing requires
one to save during the working years to support consumption after retirement.1
Specifically, this framework models the consumer as maximizing his discounted lifetime
expected utility such that consumption flows and wealth stocks at each point depend on
his permanent income, i.e., anticipated lifetime resources, as well as preference
parameters. To do so, the consumer must understand present discounted values, the
difference between nominal and real amounts, and be able to project expected future
labor income, pensions and social security benefits, retirement ages, and survival
probabilities, among many other factors. These requirements are inherently complex and
demanding.
Our goal in this paper is to evaluate how successfully individuals plan for
retirement, whether financial literacy is associated with better planning, and whether
retirement preparedness is associated with these behaviors. Specifically, in what follows,
we provide new evidence regarding people’s economic knowledge and planning, and
how these are associated with saving behavior. The analysis uses two cohorts of data
from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) in 2004 and 1992 to evaluate wealth on the
verge of retirement. Three questions are of central interest:
1) What do the level and composition of wealth tell us about the financial position of
the Baby Boomers compared to prior cohorts?
2) Are more sophisticated and financially literate individuals more likely to plan for
retirement?
3) Does planning affect wealth accumulation?

3
To address these issues, we first assess the level and distribution of wealth
holdings of Baby Boomers on the verge of retirement, along with those of a comparable
age group in 1992. Looking at both cohorts, we find that the median Boomer has more
wealth than its precursor cohort a dozen years before, but those in the lowest quartile are
less well off. We also show that housing equity is a key component of retirement assets,
though the concentration of wealth in one asset leaves many Boomers vulnerable to
fluctuations in the housing market. By contrast, holders of stocks, IRAs, and business
equity are concentrated in the top quartiles of the wealth distribution. We next assess
alternative explanations for differences in household wealth, focusing on respondents’
planning efforts and the financial literacy they bring to solving the retirement problem.
We show that financial literacy influences planning behavior and that planning, in turn,
increases wealth holdings, even after controlling for many sociodemographic factors.
Inasmuch as planning is an important predictor of saving and investment success, we
believe we have identified an important explanation for why wealth holdings differ so
much across households, and why some people enter retirement with very low amounts
of wealth.

2. An overview of pre-retirement wealth
Our analysis draws on the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a rich and detailed
nationally representative survey of Americans over the age of 50 (and their spouses of
any age). This survey was designed to track assets, liabilities, health, and patterns of
wellbeing in older households both over time and across cohorts.2 Beginning in 1992, the

2

4
survey has been administered every two years.3 In this paper, we compare and contrast
the experiences of what we call the “Early Baby Boomer” (EBB) cohort, where at least
one household member was born between 1948 and 1953, with an earlier cohort first
interviewed in 1992 (the 1992 HRS cohort). Both cohorts are selected to be in the 51-56
age range at the time of the interview. The older sample totaled 4,580 and the EBB
sample totaled 2,635 after we deleted a handful of households with missing observations
or zero income. All statistics reported use HRS household weights and all values are
expressed in 2004 dollars.
Wealth for these respondents on the verge of retirement is measured in terms of
their self-reported household total net worth; separately we also report home equity and
non-housing/non-business wealth. Total net worth is a broad concept; it includes
respondents’ checking and savings account balances, certificates of deposits and T-bills,
bonds, stocks, IRAs and Keoghs, home equity, second homes and other real estate,
business equity, vehicles, and other assets, minus all debt. Home equity refers to
respondents’ net equity in their homes after subtracting mortgage debt. Non-business-non
housing wealth is obtained by subtracting home and business equity from total net
worth.4
The distribution of total net worth for both cohorts appears in Table 1. The wealth
distribution is very skewed: Boomers’ median net worth is $152,000, while the mean is
two and a half times greater (approximately $390,000). The fact that wealth is distributed

3

A 90-minute core questionnaire is administered to age-eligible respondents and their spouses; in addition,
the “financially knowledgeable” respondent is asked to report information on household finances.
4
Two other important components of total retirement wealth not included here are Social Security and
pension wealth. For a detailed analysis of the importance of pension and Social Security wealth, see
Gustman and Steinmeier (1999). In future data releases, these components may be calculated from
administrative records linked to respondent records, but they are not currently available.

5
quite unevenly is also seen in the fact that Boomers in the third quartile have more than
10 times the wealth ($400,000) of households in the first quartile ($36,000). We also note
that Boomers hold more wealth than the earlier cohort, but the improvement has not been
uniform: in fact, Boomers in the lowest quartile of the wealth distribution have less
wealth than their precursor counterparts.5
One reason Boomers have more net worth is because they have more housing
equity; overall, the median amount of housing equity is $68,000 for the EBB group, with
a mean value twice this amount. At the mean, one-third of the early Boomers’ wealth is
held in the form of home equity, and at the median the fraction is close to half. That is,
many Americans currently on the verge of retirement have accumulated little wealth
outside their homes. Note that housing equity still represents a crucial component of net
worth (close to one-third) for even the wealthiest respondents.6 In the third column of
Table 1, when both housing and business wealth are excluded from the net worth
computation, a sizeable fraction of the Boomers turn out to have either zero or negative
net wealth (for instance, due to credit card and other loans). Indeed, if we focus only on
net worth without housing and business equity, the median Early Boomer holds less
wealth than the prior cohort. A final observation from Table 1 is that the wealthiest
households in both cohorts are disproportionately business owners; when we omit
business equity from net worth, the right tail of the wealth distribution displays much less
extreme values.7

5

This confirms earlier findings (Mitchell and Moore, 1998; Moore and Mitchell, 2000).
Given that home values are self-reported, one may wonder about the accuracy of these reports. Bucks and
Pence (2006) compare household self-reported housing data with lender-reported data. They find that most
homeowners appear to report their house value and rate of house price appreciation accurately.

See also Gentry and Hubbard (2004) and Hurst and Lusardi (2006).

6
The heterogeneity in wealth observed for both cohorts remains large even within
socio-economic groups. For instance, Table 2 (Panel A) depicts total net worth by
educational attainment and highlights the very steep wealth-education gradient; the
median Boomer respondent with less than a high school education has less than $22,000
in total net worth, whereas respondents with a high school degree have almost four times
as much, and respondents with a college degree have fourteen times as much. It is also
important to highlight the dispersion in wealth within given education groups. For
example, considering only those with a high school degree, respondents in the third
quartile hold more than 15 times as much wealth as those in the first quartile. The wealth
gradient is flattest (but still sizable) for the most educated; the third/first quartile wealth
ratio is 5 times among those with a college degree.
Other pronounced wealth differences are also evident in Table 2 where we break
down the results by race and ethnicity, marital status, and sex. One striking result within
the EBB is that the median White household reports close to $200,000 in total net worth,
whereas the Black household’s net worth value is one-eighth as large ($25,000), and the
net worth of Hispanic households is one third as large ($56,000). The third/first quartile
wealth gradient at 7.3 for Whites is much flatter than for Blacks and Hispanics. Another
large difference stands out among different marital status groupings. For instance, the
median married respondent has over four times the total net worth of the median
nonmarried respondent (where the latter group includes separated, divorced, widowed,
and never married individuals). Lack of resources is also a stark concern for the
nonmarrieds, with the bottom quartile having only $3000 in total net worth. Respondents

7
with children (most of the EBB sample) have accumulated more wealth than the
childless, and male respondents report much higher net worth than female respondents.
Comparing Boomers with their predecessors, we see that some demographic
groups are doing worse in terms of their wealth holdings when compared to the earlier
cohorts (Table 2, Panel B). For example, EBBs without a college degree display lower
wealth than the 1992 cohort. Wealth holdings are lower throughout the wealth
distribution. Blacks in 2004 have accumulated less wealth compared to 1992, and so have
those households in the lower quartiles of the income distribution.
Next, we turn to the composition of wealth. Table 3 shows again that one of the
most important assets held by both cohorts is the home. Not only are most EBB and
members of the 1992 cohorts homeowners, but home equity accounts for a third of total
net worth among the EBBs. When we sum together home equity and other real estate (an
asset most prominent among wealthier households), the amount of wealth accounted for
by total real estate is 47 percent for EBB, while it was 43.8 percent for the earlier cohort.
Thus, exposure to the housing market has risen for the EBB group, as compared to the
1992 HRS cohort.
Two other important assets in the portfolios of both cohorts are stocks and IRAs
or Keoghs. However, most households do not hold large amounts of wealth in this form;
the share of wealth accounted for by stocks is 12 percent among Boomers, up from 8
percent among the HRS cohort. The share of IRAs and Keoghs is similar but slightly
lower (10.6 percent for the EBBs and 7.5 percent for the HRS cohort). If all IRAs were
invested in equities, more than 22 percent of EBBs’ wealth would be invested in stocks,
while only about 16 percent of the earlier cohort’s wealth was invested in the stock

8
market. Thus, in addition to holding more housing, Boomers are also more exposed to the
stock market than the HRS cohort.

2.1 Vulnerability to wealth shocks
As just noted, housing wealth emerges as a key component of saving for many
Americans on the verge of retirement. Not only is the rate of homeownership very high
for Boomers, but their homes are also one of the few assets held broadly, across
educational levels and across all ethnic/racial minority groups. In view of the upward
trend in housing prices over the last decades, some have suggested that housing is good
way to finance retirement, particularly for Boomers who have benefited from widespread
appreciation of home equity. 8 Yet macroeconomic and monetary policymakers should
be concerned with this reliance on housing values to finance retirement, since a sharp
interest rate rise could induce a “hard landing” in housing values, and many Boomer
households could then experience substantial wealth losses.
To help evaluate the importance of this possibility, we have modeled what would
happen to Baby Boomers if housing prices in each region were to return to their 2002
levels. Inasmuch as home prices rose substantially over the 2002-3 period, this exercise
would imply an average national housing price drop of 13.5% (Office of Federal Housing
Enterprise Oversight, 2005). Our simulation computes how much wealth would change
for the EBBs if real estate prices (of home, second home and other real estate) declined
by as much as they rose in the respondent’s own Census region over the period. Our

8

For instance, Edmunds and Keene (2005) urge readers to “use your home to finance your
retirement…Forgot to save for retirement, but bought a house? Saved a lot and also bought a house?
Whatever your situation, (we) can show you how to best use your home equity for a long and prosperous
retirement.”

9
results suggest that a shock of this magnitude would be substantial for Boomers; 10% of
their total net worth would be lost. Furthermore, for the median household, net worth
would fall by 13.7%. This finding clearly reinforces the fact that Boomers are quite
vulnerable to housing market shocks.
A related issue to consider when assessing EBB wealth is whether this generation
anticipates using home equity to finance their retirement. Prior waves of retirees have
not downsized their homes at retirement nor have they taken up reverse mortgages (Venti
and Wise 1990, 1991). There is, however, some evidence that home equity is a buffer
used in the event of widowhood and to finance long-term care. And not surprisingly,
whether one includes or excludes housing equity has a substantive effect on measures of
Baby Boomers’ financial wellbeing (Bernheim, 1993; CBO, 1993).
In view of the rise in home equity values for Boomers, the role of housing in
financing retirement has the potential to be even more important than in the past. Of
course, we do not know yet whether and how this cohort will draw down home equity in
retirement, though it may be of interest to ask households what they expect to do. To this
end, we devised a special module for the 2004 HRS,9 where we asked homeowners the
following question:
“On (a) scale from 0 to 100, where 0 equals absolutely no chance and 100
equals absolutely certain, what are the chances that you will sell your
house to finance your [(and your (husband/wife/partner)’s] retirement?”
Answers to the question are reported in Figure 1 which summarizes results for all
respondents aged 50 and over in the 2004 HRS module (not just those in the EBB group);
the results are also similar for respondents age 50-70. Some 60% of homeowners
affirmed that they did not plan to sell their homes to finance retirement, and almost 70%
99

For detail on this module and the questions we have inserted in it, see Lusardi and Mitchell (2006).

10
of respondents felt there was a minimal (10% or less) chance they would sell their homes
to pay for retirement. In other words, most older Americans do not plan to sell their
homes to finance additional retirement expenses, though naturally this store of wealth
helps cover housing consumption needs. In what follows, we both include and exclude
net housing equity in the measures of wealth considered.10
We also analyze the potential distributional implications of a macro shock
affecting the stock market instead of the housing market. Consider, for instance, how a
stock market decline of 10% would influence Boomer wealth. Even if we assume that all
IRA assets are held in stock (in addition to direct stock holdings), only 2% of their wealth
would be lost in this event.11 The drop in median wealth would be even smaller, only
1.1%. Essentially the small impact is explained by the fact that most Boomers do not
hold equities, and those who do, hold small amounts.

2.2. Issues regarding business ownership
Earlier research has shown that business owners are very different from other
members of the population.12 As noted above, business owners are disproportionately
found at the top of the wealth distribution and they are a very heterogeneous group. For
10

Since this question is asked to older respondents, responses could simply reflect that (at least some)
households have enough wealth for retirement and do not need to sell their house. In other words, answers
to these questions may be influenced by the wealth households currently have. Unfortunately, we do not
have data for young respondents.
11
The study by Gustman and Steinmeier (2002) comes to a similar conclusion.
12
See Hurst and Lusardi (2004, 2006) and Hurst, Lusardi, Kennickell and Torralba (2005). As Hurst and
Lusardi (2004, 2006) have shown, business owners are more likely to be male, white, and married, and they
also are more likely to come from families of business owners or highly educated families. They also have
stronger ties with family and relatives; and they are more likely to have received and also to give money to
family and relatives. Most importantly, business owners may display different motives to save than the rest
of the population; they are not only much more likely to state they wish to leave a bequest to heirs but they
are also less likely to be covered by pensions. Business owners may also need to maintain large amounts of
working capital both to deal with necessities of their business and to maintain effective control over the
business. Moreover, if households are compensated for taking greater risks with higher returns, it is again
not surprising that business owners have higher wealth holdings than non-business owners.

11
example, 14% of business owners indicate they have no business equity, but median
business equity is $50,000 and those at the very top hold as much as $20 million.
Moreover, business owners hold a great deal of wealth in their businesses; over 40% of
them hold a quarter or more of their wealth in this form.13
As in the case of housing, it is unclear whether business owners think of their
business equity as an asset they will use to finance their retirement, and whether they plan
to sell off their businesses when they retire. A large fraction of business owners explicitly
state they will never retire completely (Hurst and Lusardi, 2006); since many business
owners are self-employed, it is accordingly difficult to characterize exactly what
“retirement” might entail for this group. There are also important measurement problems
that arise when studying business owners. Tax evasion may drive some to underreport
their income, and legal tax avoidance mechanisms can induce some owners to retain a
portion of their compensation within their business.14 The percentage of business owners
has fallen between the two cohorts, and so too has the share of total wealth invested in
business equity (Table 3). Because we cannot fully account for all the nuances associated
with business ownership, we exclude business owners in the multivariate analysis of
savings.

3. Planning and wealth
One aspect of saving patterns that has received little attention to date is the fact
that saving decisions are complex, requiring consumers to possess substantial economic
knowledge and information. Our previous paper (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2006) used a

13
14

See also Gentry and Hubbard (2004).
Holtz-Eakin et al. (1994) also emphasize the many tax incentives in business ownership.

12
special module covering a subset of 2004 HRS respondents and demonstrated that only a
small fraction (less than a one-third) of older respondents ever tried to figure out how
much they needed to save for retirement. The fraction of older persons reporting they not
only tried but actually succeeded in developing a saving plan is even smaller (18%).15
One presumption of the theoretical life-cycle model of saving is that consumers
are forward-looking and make plans for the future. To assess the empirical evidence for
this point, we now focus on how much people have thought about retirement. The
wording of the question in the HRS is as follows:
How much have you thought about retirement? A lot, some, a little, or hardly at all?
Results for both cohorts are presented in Table 4 (Panels A and B). As many as
28% of the early Boomers report that they have not thought about retirement at all,
slightly fewer than the 32% in the 1992 HRS cohort.16 The fact that few people plan for
retirement is also support by many other studies which show that older workers are
woefully underinformed about their old-age benefits. Indeed in the 1990s, only half of
prior HRS cohorts could identify what type of pension plan they had (defined benefit,
defined contribution, or hybrid) and fewer than half could identify when they would be
eligible for early or normal retirement benefits (see also Mitchell,1988; Gustman and
Steinmeier, 2004). Information about Social Security is also scanty. Only two-fifths of
earlier HRS respondents could venture a guess about their expected Social Security
benefits and many respondents knew little about program rules; over half of current
workers expect to become eligible for full Social Security benefits at younger ages than
15

For additional evidence of lack of retirement planning, see Lusardi (1999, 2002, 2003), Ameriks, Caplin
and Leahy (2003) and Yakoboski and Dickemper (1997).
16
Some households are not asked this question (for example, those who state they will never retire are not
asked this question), so percentages refer to those who were asked. In our multivariate analysis, we add a
dummy for this group of non-respondents.

13
are actually feasible (Gustman and Steinmeier, 2004; 2001 Employee Benefits Research
Institute’s Retirement Confidence Survey). Overall, households are quite uninformed
about many of the key variables that should enter well-reasoned saving plans (Bernheim,
1998).
Also clear in Table 4 is the bimodal relationship between effort devoted to
planning and household net worth. That is, those who report they undertook any planning
– even “a little” – are much better off than those who said they planned “hardly at all.” In
other words, undertaking even a little planning is associated with sizable wealth holdings,
while non-planners display less wealth. The same pattern is present among the 1992
cohort. In other words, regardless of changes in home and stock prices, failure to plan for
retirement for both cohorts is tantamount to having very little retirement savings. To
highlight that planners hold substantially more wealth, we group households into two
types: planners (those who have thought a lot, some, or a little about retirement) and nonplanners (those who have thought hardly at all about retirement). At the median, planners
hold double the amount of wealth of non-planners; differences are slightly less at the
means. This is because there are a number of high-wealth households who do not plan for
retirement.
We also find that nonplanners are disproportionately concentrated among the least
educated, and among Blacks and Hispanics.17 As shown in Table 2, these groups are also
those with the lowest wealth levels. Next, we show that planning may provide an
explanation for the differences in wealth holdings and why some households arrive close
to retirement with little or no wealth.

17

For brevity, tables are not reported. For a detailed analysis of planning across cohorts and demographic
groups, see Lusardi and Beeler (2006).

14

3.1 Planning and financial literacy
One reason people fail to plan is because they are financially unsophisticated.
Our prior research explored whether older respondents display basic financial literacy
(Lusardi and Mitchell, 2006). Those results are not encouraging: half the respondents
surveyed in our module cannot make a simple calculation regarding interest rates over a
5-year period and do not know the difference between nominal and real interest rates. An
even larger percentage of respondents do not know that holding a single company stock is
riskier than holding a stock mutual fund.
To pursue this question further in the present context we turn to the 2004 HRS,
where respondents are presented with several questions that we use to assess financial
and political literacy. 18 Three financial literacy questions are asked, as follows:
1) “If the chance of getting a disease is 10 percent, how many people out of 1,000
would be expected to get the disease”?
2) “If 5 people all have the winning number in the lottery and the prize is 2
million dollars, how much will each of them get?”
For respondents who give the correct answer to either the first or the second question, the
following question is then asked:
3) “Let’s say you have 200 dollars in a savings account. The account earns 10
percent interest per year. How much would you have in the account at the end of
two years?”
For each case, if the respondent gets the answer correctly, we set the answer equal to 1,
and 0 otherwise. These are recoded as “Percentage Calculation,” “Lottery Division,” and

18

Questions are also available on respondents’ success at counting backward and subtracting 7 from 100
five times. The answers to these calculations are highly correlated with the questions we take up in the text.
Because these questions do not refer to economic calculations, we have not included them in our empirical
analysis.

15
“Compound Interest” variables respectively. We also define a “Political Literacy”
variable equal to 1 if the respondent correctly knows the names of the US President and
Vice President; this is likely to capture respondents’ awareness of future tax and
macroeconomic prospects.19
Table 5 summarizes how this group of Boomers answered the economic and
political literacy questions. While more than 80% got the percentage calculation right,
only about half got the lottery division right. Only 18% could correctly compute
compound interest; of those who got the compound interest wrong, 43% undertook a
simple interest calculation thereby overlooking the interest which accrues on both
principal and interest. Also note that a fifth of the sample could not name either the US
President or Vice President.20
Further detail on financial literacy appears in Figure 2, which reports the
distribution of correct responses for respondents in different educational and racial/ethnic
groups. For all four measures, literacy rises steeply with education: the more educated are
much more likely to answer the economic and political literacy queries correctly. These
differences are statistically significant. Blacks and Hispanics are less likely to answer
correctly than Whites (again differences are statistically significant), which may not be
surprising as the former groups report lower wealth levels. Nevertheless, there are also
sharp cross-question variations. For instance, all three racial/ethnic groups score over
50% on the percentage calculation, and all three score low on the compound interest

19

These questions were asked only of respondents who entered the sample in 2004, so we lose
approximately 600 observations when we consider these data.
20
Similar results about lack of financial literacy are reported by Bernheim (1985, 1988), Hogarth and
Hilgert (2002), Hilgert, Hogarth and Beverly (2003), Moore (2003), Mandell (2004), and the National
Council on Economic Education (2005).

16
question. These findings suggest that the HRS questions may be able to capture different
types of financial savvy.
Table 6 reports Probit estimates of the effect of literacy on planning (being a
planner is defined, as mentioned before, as having thought about retirement a little, some,
or a lot). Across the board, financial literacy is important for planning. The most
important variable, quantitatively, is the one reflecting knowledge of interest
compounding, which makes sense inasmuch as it is critical for saving plans. It is also
worth disaggregating those who answer correctly, those who answer incorrectly, and
those who do not know the answers, so we can distinguish between knowledge versus
lack thereof. People who are unable to divide the lottery winnings are less likely to be
planners, and the effect is quantitatively important. Moreover, the knowledge of interest
compounding and the inability to do simple calculations still have an impact on planning,
even after accounting for demographic factors including education, race, marital status,
number of children, retirement status, and sex.

3.2 The role of planning in retirement wealth accumulation
By influencing planning patterns, financial literacy may influence household
saving outcomes. Several explanations might account for the empirical observation that
planning is associated with higher retirement wealth. For instance, planning may be a
proxy for personal attributes such as patience, diligence, or other factors associated with
having a low discount rate – which are also likely to be associated with wealth. In this
case, one might anticipate that controlling for socio-economic and demographic
characteristics in multivariate wealth regressions would produce a cleaner estimate of the

17
planning effect. To investigate the importance of this explanation in our dataset, we
examine whether the positive relationship between levels of wealth and planning
described in Table 4 persists after controlling for factors conventionally thought to
determine wealth. Here we focus on total net worth and also on non-housing, nonbusiness wealth; in addition we examine housing wealth in view of the widespread
pattern of homeownership and the importance of housing in total wealth. We drop
business owners from the sample and trim the bottom and top 1% of the wealth
distribution to exclude outliers.
Our empirical strategy in Table 7 first controls for the conventional determinants
of wealth likely to be associated with household permanent income and preferences.
These include variables measuring respondents’ educational attainment, sex,
race/ethnicity, marital status, age, number of children, retirement status (whether fully or
partly retired), and household income (in natural logs).21 Our strategy then adds to this
canonical set of regressors a new determinant of wealth, namely the respondent’s selfreport of whether he is a planner. The test we perform is whether planning is associated
with wealth outcomes after controlling for the conventional factors associated with
saving. Further, by pooling the EBB and 1992 HRS samples, we can examine the effect
of planning over time. The year dummy and the interaction between the year and the
planner dummy test whether the wealth/planning relationship is changing over time.
Inasmuch as wealth distributions are skewed, we perform both OLS and median
regressions.
The estimates in Table 7 show that planning is strongly positively associated with
higher total net worth in this multivariate framework. Thus, planning continues to have
21

Taking the log of income downweights outliers.

18
an effect on wealth, even after accounting for many demographic factors. The planning
effect in columns 1-2 is sizable and does not change across cohorts: the median
regression estimates indicate that those who plan accumulate close to 20% more total net
worth, while the mean regressions indicate that those who plan accumulate 13% more
wealth. For non-housing wealth (columns 3-4), the impact is larger; the median and mean
estimates indicate that planners accumulate 32% and 19% more wealth respectively.
Turning to home equity (columns 5-6), we note that those who plan accumulate 16%
more wealth in home equity (median estimates). Other variables have the impacts that
might be anticipated: both education and race/ethnicity remain strongly associated with
wealth levels. Specifically, those with at least some college have far more wealth than
those who did not complete high school, and Blacks have far less wealth than Whites, all
else equal. Married couples have higher wealth and so do high income households, other
factors constant.22

3.3. Does planning affect wealth or does wealth affect planning?
These estimates confirm that planners accumulate larger amounts of wealth than
nonplanners. But if planning is correlated with unobservable character traits which cannot
readily be controlled for, the measured planning effect might not be a true measure of the
causal relationship we seek to assess. While this argument has some theoretical merit, it
does not match findings from other studies. For example, Lusardi (1999, 2002, 2003)
adds a long list of controls to wealth regressions to proxy for individual characteristics.
She also adds subjective expectations about Social Security, house prices, and expected
22

We have also tried different empirical specifications. For example, we added controls for risk aversion
and controls for subjective expectations about longevity and Social Security. Our main results remain
unchanged and for brevity, we do not include these results in the table.

19
retirement ages. Her estimates of planning remain positive and statistically significant.
Moreover, when she instruments for planning using the difference between the
respondent’s age and the age of his older siblings (a measure of planning costs), she
concludes that the planning effects are again positive and statistically significant but even
larger. Similar findings are offered by Ameriks, Caplin and Leahy (2003).
Another possible confound is that planning may reduce uncertainty concerning
future asset returns and future income. However, this works in the “wrong” direction, in
that less uncertainty should lead to less rather than more wealth as the precautionary
saving motive decreases. Ameriks, Caplin and Leahy (2003) have data on measures of
subjective uncertainty about income in their TIAA-CREF survey, but find little evidence
that planners display lower subjective uncertainty concerning future income.
Yet another way in which planning may affect wealth is via portfolio choice. For
instance, the financially and politically illiterate, who are less likely to plan, may also be
unlikely to invest in high-return or tax-favored assets. This would lead to low savings, if
combined with an elasticity of intertemporal substitution less than one. This view is
consistent with Lusardi’s (2003) evidence that planning increases stock ownership.
A different explanation about how planning might affect wealth is addressed by
psychological research on self-control. If consumers want to save but simply lack the
self-discipline to do so, planning might help consumers control their consumption
(Ameriks, Caplin, Leahy, and Taylor, 2004). Related work by Gollwitzer (1996, 1999)
demostrates experimentally that people are more likely to achieve goals and translate
their intentions into actions when they develop concrete plans. One striking finding from
the psychological research is that a simple planning activity, such as getting experimental

20
subjects to write down the specific steps they will take to implement a task, can greatly
increase follow-through. These successes may help explain why merely thinking about
retirement can produce wide differences in retirement wealth. Moreover, it may explain
the bimodal distribution of wealth observed in Table 4, and why even “a little” or “some”
planning generates large wealth differences, as compared to those who did not think
about retirement at all.
Nevertheless, the causality may go the other way: for instance, wealthier
households may plan more because they have more to gain by planning. On the other
hand, wealthier households might not plan because they do not need to; they may already
have enough for retirement. To assess the possible importance of such reverse causality
in our sample of households nearing retirement, we first examine a regression where the
dependent variable is being a planner, and then control for the same variables as
examined previously in Table 7, with the addition of wealth. OLS estimates in Table 8
indicate that the scope for such a reverse causality effect is small: indeed, a wealth
increase of $1,000 would be interpreted as boosting the probability of planning only by
less than 0.1 percentage point.
A further test must consider “exogenous” variations in wealth. In other words, we
require an instrumental variable which is uncorrelated with unmeasured unobservables in
the error term but correlated with wealth. We believe that an ideal instrument to assess
the impact of wealth on planning is available from the housing market. In both 1992 and
2004, there were substantial changes in the housing market: in 1992, the economy was at
the end of a housing price bust, whereas in 2004, the economy experienced a housing
boom. In both instances, regional housing prices changed substantially across the US,

21
creating changes in household wealth for reasons unrelated to individual unobservable
characteristics. As an example, home prices rose between 2003 and 2004 by 10.3% in the
Pacific region, but only 3.6% in the South. In 1992, the housing bust was particularly
pronounced in New England, and less serious elsewhere. Accordingly, we use as an
instrument for wealth the regional housing price changes in the previous year (2003-04
for the EBB; 1991-92 for the 1992 HRS cohort). We also note that changes in home
prices affect more than home equity values; with the development of home equity lines of
credit, increased home equity can easily be accessed by households.23
Regional housing price changes are a good predictor of respondents’ net worth.
The first-stage estimate of housing price changes is +12.729 with a standard error of
1.483; this implies that a 1% housing price increase raised wealth by over $12,000.24 Yet
the instrumental variable estimates in Table 8 reveal that the effect of wealth on planning
is not statistically significant. Considering each cohort separately, the effect of wealth is
either statistically insignificant or negative. In other words, when people grow wealthier,
they tend to plan less (and some wealthy households do not plan at all).25 This
underscores the fact that the OLS estimates of planning on wealth reported in Table 7
most likely underestimate the full effect of planning on wealth.

4. Conclusions
This paper takes several new steps in linking workers’ financial literacy to their
success at retirement planning and their accumulation of retirement wealth. First, we
23

Hurst and Stafford (1994) document that households are willing to borrow (and lenders willing to lend)
when capital gains on housing rise.
24
When we perform this regression in each year separately, we find that the first-stage estimate of housing
price changes is +18.619 (s.e. 2.562) in 2004 and -2.936 (s.e. 1.626) in 1992.
25
See Lusardi and Beeler (2006) for detail.

22
compare the net worth of the early Baby Boomer cohort in 2004 with that of another
cohort of the same age (51-56) in another period of time (1992). We find that Boomers
have higher levels of net worth than the previous cohort, principally because they hold
more housing wealth. We also identify key differences in the distribution of wealth and
conclude that the poorest Boomers are actually worse off than their earlier counterparts.
The fact that wealth is very low for Blacks, and Hispanics, and the least educated did not
change over time. In part this may be due to low levels of financial literacy among these
groups.
Second, we show that respondents who report they planned for retirement enter
their golden years with higher wealth levels. We further show that planning is strongly
correlated with financial and political literacy and that the relationship between planning
and wealth remains strong, even after controlling for many sociodemographic factors. We
explore the possibility that it is wealth that affects planning rather than planning that
affects wealth, but our statistical tests indicate this is not the case.
We believe that our research findings are particularly relevant in the current
policy environment. For some time there has been substantial employer interest regarding
ways to enhance worker retirement security. To this end, some firms have offered their
employees retirement seminars (Lusardi, 2004), and financial advice provision has been
made more feasible by the new Pension Protection Act of 2006. While some contend that
such programs cannot do much to enhance retirement savings, our analysis implies that
planning can actually jump-start the retirement saving process. A one-size-fits-all
approach is unlikely to do much to build retirement wealth, and education programs must
be targeted specifically to particular subgroups. Nevertheless, differences in planning

23
behavior do help explain why household retirement assets differ, and why some people
cross the retirement threshold with very low (or no) wealth.
As recently noted by Campbell (2006), it is often difficult for consumers to
exhibit carefully-reasoned and informed economic decisions:
“[F]or many households, the discrepancies between observed and ideal
behavior have relatively minor consequences and can easily be
rationalized by small frictions that are ignored in standard finance
theory. For a minority of households, however, particularly poorer and
less educated households, there are larger discrepancies with
potentially serious consequences.”
Our findings provide support for this statement and highlight the fact that specific groups in
the economy, particularly those with low education, low income and Black and Hispanic
households, are at risk of not preparing adequately for their retirement.
