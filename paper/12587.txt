Volatility in International Financial Market Issuance: The Role of the Financial Center
Marco Cipriani and Graciela L. Kaminsky
NBER Working Paper No. 12587
October 2006
JEL No. F3
ABSTRACT
We study the pattern of volatility of gross issuance in international capital markets since 1980. We
find several short-lived episodes of high volatility. Over the long run, however, volatility has declined,
suggesting that international financial integration has not made financial markets more erratic. We
use VAR analysis to examine the determinants of the time-varying pattern of volatility, focusing in
particular on the role of financial centers. Our results suggest that a significant portion of the decline
in volatility of issuance in international capital markets can be explained by the reduction in the volatility
of U.S. interest rates.

There is a vast literature in international finance arguing that the increase in financial
globalization over the last 30 years has made capital markets more erratic. This literature has
highlighted how sequences of booms and busts in capital flows and in asset prices have become
the norm rather than the exception, often wreaking havoc upon the economies of the affected
countries. As a result, many economists in academia and in policy institutions have argued in
favor of the imposition of controls on the capital account to reduce the volatility of capital flows
and limit the impact that financial turmoil has on real economic activity.1
In this paper, we examine further whether, in fact, international capital markets have
become more erratic. Contrary to most of the studies in this area, we do not focus on net
international capital flows, but on gross issuance. We do so to better capture the ability of
countries to gain access to international capital markets. 2 Moreover, whereas most of the
literature has focused on the analysis of volatility in the access to international markets by
emerging economies and the public sector, in this paper we analyze emerging- and matureeconomy issuance as well as private and public issuance. Also contrary to most of the literature,
we do not restrict ourselves to the bond market, but describe the behavior of issuance in the three
main international financial markets: The international bond, equity, and syndicated-loan market.
The focus of this paper is the behavior of volatility of gross issuance in international
financial markets over the last three decades. We show that, although international issuance has
experienced several episodes of booms and busts, over the last thirty years there has been a
substantial reduction in the degree of market volatility. Markets are more stable now than they
were at the beginning of the 1980s, thus providing a rationale for the elimination of controls on
capital flows.
Our paper also relates to a strand of literature in international finance that emphasizes the
role of financial centers and their monetary and economic policies in affecting capital flows and
price movements in the periphery (see, for example, Calvo, Leiderman, and Reinhart (1993)).
Using VAR analysis, we show that the time-varying volatility of issuance in international
financial markets can be explained in part by the behavior of macroeconomic and financial
fundamentals in the United States. We find that, overall, economic and financial fundamentals in

The evidence provided by net capital inflows presents an incomplete picture of financial integration. For instance,
although zero net capital inflows may reflect no international financial integration, they may also reflect complete
integration with international diversification, where inflows are just offset by outflows.

the United States explain about 25 percent of the movements in volatility of issuance around the
world, whereas volatility of U.S. interest rates alone explains, on average, about 10 percent of
volatility of issuance. Since the volatility of U.S. interest rates has diminished substantially over
the last thirty years, our results suggest that such reduction in interest rate volatility can explain
part of the reduction of volatility of issuance in international markets.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 1 describes the dataset. Section 2
analyzes the pattern of volatility of issuance across countries. Section 3 presents the results of the
VAR analysis. Section 4 concludes.

1 The Data

This section discusses the data sources for bond, equity, and syndicated-loan issuance in
international markets as well as the construction of the volatility of the issuance series used in
our estimations.

1.1 Sources

We use data gathered by Dealogic, a data analysis firm that produces two datasets on
financial asset issuance: Bondware, containing information on issuance in the international bond
and equity markets; and Loanware, containing information on the syndicated-loan market. 3
Both databases start in 1980, although coverage of equity in Bondware only starts in 1983. Both
datasets cover issuance by over 110 countries. For the bond and the syndicated-loan markets, the
databases include borrowing by both the private sector and the government.
Bondware contains information on issuance of bonds and equity, both in the international
and in the domestic markets. In the paper we restrict our analysis to issuance in international
markets. Following the BIS classification, for the bond market, our definition of international
issuance comprises all foreign currency issues by residents and non-residents in a given country
and all domestic currency issues launched in the domestic market by non-residents. In addition,

3

For a more detailed description of the Bondware and Loanware datasets, see Cipriani and Kaminsky (2006).

2

domestic currency issues launched in the domestic market by residents are also considered
international issues if they are specifically targeted at non-resident investors.4
The equity portion of Bondware covers several types of placements: Issuance of common
or preferred equity in the international market, issuance targeted at a particular foreign market,
registered stocks traded in foreign exchanges as domestic instruments (for example, American
depositary receipts (ADRs)), and issuance by residents in the domestic markets. Since in this
paper we focus only on international issuance, we only include the first three types of offerings.
The Loanware dataset contains information on syndicated loans, issued both in the
international and in the domestic market since the 1980s. Syndicated loans are credits granted by
a group of banks to a borrower. In a syndicated loan, two or more banks jointly agree to make a
loan to a borrower. Although there is a single contract, every syndicate member has a separate
claim on the debtor. All participating banks have earnings based on a spread over a floating rate
benchmark (typically Libor). Some of the banks also have earnings related to various types of
fees.5 As for the case of bonds and equities, in our analysis we are only interested in syndicated
loans issued in the international market. According to the BIS classification, international loans
include all syndicated loans where the nationality of at least one of the syndicate banks is
different from that of the borrower.

1.2 Measuring Volatility in International Capital Markets

The focus of our paper is the role of the financial center in determining the pattern of
volatility in international capital markets. Thus, we are interested in the relationship between the
center and the periphery. For the purpose of our analysis, we consider the United States as the
main financial center. The periphery consists of eight groups of countries: The emerging
periphery, including four regional groups of countries (Asia, Latin America, Middle East and

4

This definition covers Euro-market offerings (i.e., bonds issued and sold outside the country of the currency in
which they are denominated, like dollar-denominated bonds issued in Europe or Asia), global bonds (i.e., single
offerings structured to allow simultaneous placements in major markets: Europe, U.S., and Asia), and foreign
offerings (i.e., bonds issued by firms and governments outside the issuer’s country, usually denominated in the
currency of the country in which they are issued. Foreign bonds include Samurai and Yankee bonds.

The description of syndicated loans is based on Gadanecz 2004.

Africa, and Transition Economies); and the mature periphery, consisting of three countries and
one group of countries (Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Other Mature Economies6).
In order to build our volatility series, we aggregate the individual issuance data in
quarterly issuance by the financial center (the United States) and by each of the eight
groups/countries in the periphery. 7 For each country or group, we construct three volatility
measures, one for each financial instrument (bonds, equities, and syndicated loans). Volatility in
each market8 is measured as the annualized9 standard deviation of the quarterly growth rate of
international issuance. The standard deviation is computed over a moving window of four
quarters.

2 Volatility of Issuance: Short- and Long-Run Patterns

Figure 1 reports the behavior of our measure of financial volatility of total world issuance
in the bond, equity, and syndicated-loan markets. As the existing literature on international
capital flows has highlighted, there are several short lived episodes of market turmoil. Some of
these episodes of market turbulence are clearly related to currency crises in emerging economies.
For example, volatility of issuance in the bond and the syndicated-loan market increases sharply
during the Asian and Russian crises. Sharp increases in world volatility are also linked to
heightened volatility in mature economies. For instance, the increase in volatility in the
syndicated-loan market in the late 1980s (shown in more detail in Figure 2) is linked to the
shocks that followed the German reunification in 1989 and the burst of the Japanese bubble in
the late 1980s.
Figure 1, however, also shows that over the long run, there has been a marked reduction
in volatility in the three financial markets that we examine. The first column of Table 2 shows
the average levels of volatility in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s in the three markets. Over this

6

This last group includes all OECD countries with the exception of Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the
United States. Table 1 shows the countries included in each of the five regional groups.
7

To filter out seasonal fluctuations, we take four-quarter moving averages of issuance.

8

In the remainder of the paper, we will use the words “instrument” and “market” interchangeably.

9

As is standard in the finance literature, the annualized quarterly variance is the variance that would be measured
over a year if the quarterly returns were iid; that is, the annualized quarterly variance equals the raw quarterly
variance multiplied by four. The annualized standard deviation is its square root.

period, volatility declined from 16 to 8 percent in the bond market, from 58 to 23 percent in the
equity market and from 15 to 7 percent in the syndicated-loan market. This suggests that, over
the long run, markets have become less, not more erratic. Such decline in issuance volatility
since the 1980s is similar to that observed in many macroeconomic real variables, the so-called
Great Moderation.10 Note that the behavior of issuance volatility contrasts with that of financial
price volatility. While U.S. interest rate volatility has declined substantially since the 1980s
(from an average of 2 percent in the 1980s to an average of 0.05 percent in the 2000s), exchange
rate volatility and stock market volatility have mostly remained unchanged.11
In order to examine in more detail the causes of the time-varying pattern of issuance
volatility around the world, Figures 2 and 3 show issuance volatility by mature and emerging
economies separately, whereas Table 2 summarizes the evidence in these figures by showing the
average levels of volatility in the three markets in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s.
As shown in Figure 2, volatility of issuance by mature economies in the three markets
declines almost continuously for all countries and regions, with the exception of Japanese bond
issuance and U.S. equity issuance. Overall, volatility of issuance in the three markets halves from
the 1980s to the 2000s. Nevertheless, we observe episodes of high financial turmoil. For
example, volatility of German equity issuance increases four-fold around the time of the German
reunification. The combination of an expansionary fiscal policy and a tight monetary policy in
Germany around the early 1990s12 dramatically affected German equity issuance, with issuance
collapsing from 1.8 billion dollars in 1988 to 400 million dollars in 1989. Equity issuance
remained low (on average 700 million dollars per year) until after the 1992-1993 ERM crises. By
1994, issuance had rebounded to about 4.5 billion dollars. Interestingly, turbulences in German
equity-market issuance did not affect issuance by other European countries. Similarly, volatility
of European issuance did not increase dramatically during the crises of 1992-1993.
An episode of extreme volatility of issuance in the syndicated-loan market occurred
during the height of the bubble in Japan. International loan issuance by Japan increased from an

For an analysis of the relationship between asset price volatility and real economy volatility, see the remarks by
Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Roger W. Ferguson, Jr. to the Banco de Mexico International Conference,
Mexico City, Mexico. Note, however, that a decline in volatility has been observed in investors’ forecasts, which
should be one of the determinants of asset price volatility (see Campbell, 2005).

average of 700 million dollars in the mid-1980s to 4 billion dollars in 1989, to then fall to 2
billion dollars in 2000, and to finally collapse to 200 million dollars in 2001. As in the case of
Germany, this episode of volatility did not spill over to other countries.
Finally, let us note that volatility of United States issuance in international bond markets
sharply increased during the 1981-82 recession. On average, volatility during 1981-1982 is
twice as high as volatility in the mid-1980s.
Figure 3 reports volatility of emerging-economy issuance. As in the case of mature
economies, volatility of issuance shows a downward trend. Such a decline in volatility, however,
is less pronounced than that of mature economies. As observed in mature economies, there are
short-lived episodes of high volatility, mostly linked to currency and banking crises in the
various regions. For example, between 1996 and 1998, volatility of Asian issuance increased
from 22 to 44 percent in the bond market, from 26 to 35 percent in the equity market, and from 5
to 25 percent in the syndicated-loan market. During this episode, Asian international issuance
declined 65 percent on average in the bond, equity, and syndicated-loan markets. Volatility in
emerging economies is also related to terms of trade shocks; for example, bond issuance in the
Middle East collapsed during the sharp decline in oil prices in 1986 and volatility in the bond
market increased from 52 percent in 1985 to 142 percent in 1986.
Table 3 complements the findings in Figures 2 and 3. In this table, we formally test for
the presence of clusters of volatility over time. We estimate a GARCH(1,1) model for each of the
issuance series and test the restriction that the GARCH and ARCH coefficients are equal to zero
using a Maximum Likelihood test.13 As shown in Table 3, we reject the null hypothesis of no
heteroscedasticity at all conventional significance levels for all the series with the exception of
those of the bond market in Japan and the Middle East.
Finally, it is important to remark that volatility is significantly higher in the equity than in
the bond and syndicated-loan markets. Over the whole sample, total annualized volatility is on
average 12 percent in both the bond and syndicated-loan markets and 33 percent in the equity
market (see Table 2).14 This observation also holds true if we look at each region and country

13

Autoregressive volatility models, like the ARCH and GARCH models, were first introduced by Engle 1982 and
Bollerslev 1986, respectively.

14

Note, however, that the very high level of volatility in the equity markets at the beginning of the sample (see
Figures 2 and 3) is due to the fact that in those early years the international equity market was very thin.

separately. Such an empirical regularity is similar to what we also observe in price data (where
stock market volatility is higher than interest rate and bond price volatility).

3 The Role of the Financial Center

There is an extensive literature on the role of financial centers, and in particular U.S.
financial markets, in the transmission of international shocks. For instance, Ehrmann, Fratzcher,
and Rigobon (2005) analyze the comovement among stock returns, interest rates, and the
exchange rate in the United States and the European Monetary Union and find that U.S. financial
markets are one of the main driver forces of the euro-area financial markets, explaining, on
average 25 percent of the variance in financial prices. Also, Calvo, Leiderman, and Reinhart
(1993 have shown the importance of developed countries macroeconomic performance (growth
and interest rates) on the fluctuations of capital inflows to emerging markets. More recently,
Kaminsky and Reinhart (2003) have argued that the financial markets in developed countries act
as a transmission mechanism of financial turmoil among emerging economies.
To have a preliminary reading on the role of the financial center on the volatility of
financial markets around the world, we estimate the correlations between the volatility of
issuance by the periphery (both mature and emerging economies) and the volatility of issuance
by the financial center (the United States). As shown in Table 4, the correlation between the
volatility of issuance of all the regional groups and countries in the periphery and that of the
United States is mostly positive and quite high. Interestingly, issuance volatility is much more
highly correlated in the bond market than in the equity and syndicated-loan market (the average
correlation is 0.41 in the bond market and 0.19 and 0.15 in the loan and equity markets,
respectively). Two countries stand out in the table. The first is the United Kingdom, whose
pattern of volatility is very close to that of the United States (the correlation in the bond market
almost reaches 0.70); the other is Japan, with basically no comovement of volatility with that of
the United States.15
Since volatility of issuance in the bond, equity, and syndicated-loan markets in most
countries or regions is positively correlated with that of the United States, in the remainder of
15

Although not shown in the Table, the volatilities of Japanese issuance in all markets are basically uncorrelated
with volatilities around the world. Even in the bond market, the average correlation of each country’s or region’s
volatility with that of Japan is -0.08.

7

this section we try to shed light on which economic links exist between U.S. issuance volatility
and that of the other regions in the world.
There is an extensive theoretical and empirical literature on the determinants of financial
market volatility. A large number of studies have devoted their attention to U.S. monetary policy
and have shown that it plays a key role in explaining fluctuations in asset prices, both in the
United States and in the rest of the world.16 Following this strand of literature, we examine the
effect of U.S. monetary policy on the ability of emerging and developed countries to gain access
to international financial markets.
Monetary policy in the United States can be transmitted directly to the rest of the world
or indirectly by affecting prices of assets in the United States. To capture this indirect linkage
and also to examine the possible spillovers of turbulence in financial markets in the United States
to markets around the world, we include the volatility of U.S. equity prices in our analysis.
The relationship between inflation and financial prices has also been the focus of
attention of both theoretical and empirical research over the past 20 years. Most of this research
relates the uncertainty generated by higher inflation to increases in financial risk and therefore to
lower asset prices. For this reason, we also investigate the spillover effects of U.S. inflation on
financial markets around the world.
Finally, the literature on financial crises has pointed out that turmoil in financial markets
(or at least in emerging economies) often happens during episodes of slowdown in world
economic activity. For example, the debt crisis in Latin America in 1982 occurred in the midst
of a profound recession in the United States and other industrial economies. In contrast, the
empirical research on mutual fund markets suggests that volatility in financial markets may
increase in good times. For example, Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers (1995) examine whether
U.S. mutual funds follow momentum strategies –buying past winners and selling past losers.
They find that mutual funds do in fact buy past winners but do not sell past losers, suggesting
that good news may generate higher volatility in financial markets. Therefore, we also examine
the connection between episodes of higher economic growth and volatility of international
issuance.

See, for example, Ehrmann, Fratzcher, and Rigobon (2005) for a study of the effect of U.S. monetary policy on
asset prices in the European Union and Ehrmann and Fratzscher (2006) for an analysis of the effect of U.S.
monetary policy on equity prices around the world.

Table 5 looks in more detail at the relationship between U.S. economic and financial
variables and volatility of issuance in international markets. Volatility of the U.S. monetary
policy is captured with the volatility of the three-month U.S. Treasury Bill rate, U.S. stock
market volatility is the volatility of the Dow Jones Industrial Index, U.S. inflation is the annual
U.S. CPI inflation rate, and the fluctuations in economic activity in the United States are
captured by the annual U.S. GNP growth rate. As shown in the first column of Table 5,
volatilities of issuance in all markets are positively correlated (and with relatively high
correlation coefficients) with interest rate volatility. Although with smaller coefficients, volatility
of issuance is overall also positively correlated with U.S. stock market volatility, U.S. inflation,
and U.S. growth.
In order to understand better the transmission of volatility shocks from the center to the
periphery, we estimate a Vector Autoregression model separately for emerging and mature
economies.17 We estimate three VARs separately for each market (bond, equity, and syndicatedloan issuance volatilities). Each estimated VAR has five variables: volatility of issuance, interestrate volatility, volatility of U.S. stock market returns, U.S. CPI inflation rate, and U.S. GNP
growth rate. Each VAR model includes two lags of all the variables. The R2 for each of the
VARs that we estimate, reported on Table 6, are all above 0.80.
Figures 4 to 6 show the impulse responses18 of issuance volatility in the bond, equity, and
syndicated-loan market to a one-percentage point shock in the U.S. growth rate, U.S. inflation,
U.S. interest rate volatility, and U.S. stock market volatility. Tables 7 to 9 show the
corresponding variance decomposition.
As shown in Figures 4 to 6, overall volatility of issuance in the three markets increases
with higher volatility of interest rates and of stock prices, as well as with a higher U.S. inflation
rate.19 Overall, volatility of issuance also increases in good times (times of high growth in U.S.
output). Nevertheless, not all shocks in U.S. indicators have statistically significant effects on
17

In the present model, mature-economy issuance volatility includes that of the United States. In order to isolate the
effect of U.S. variables on other mature economies, we also re-estimated the same model having volatility of U.S.
issuance and volatility of the mature-periphery issuance as two different variables. The results are similar and are
available upon request.
18

We use the Cholesky decomposition to identify the shocks. The ordering of the variables is: Output growth,
inflation, stock market volatility, interest rate volatility, and volatility of issuance. We checked for different
orderings and the results do not change significantly.
19

Note, however, that the response of loan issuance volatility to increases in the U.S. inflation rate is hump-shaped.

issuance volatility. For example, shocks to U.S. inflation do not have statistically significant
effects on turmoil in bond issuance of emerging economies.
Shocks to U.S. interest-rate volatility are the ones that affect volatilities of gross issuance
more strongly.

Moreover, they have far stronger effects on emerging than on mature

economies.20 This evidence supports those findings in the international financial literature that
suggest that fluctuations in U.S. monetary policy have triggered dramatic boom-bust patterns in
international capital flows to Asia and Latin America.21
Figures 4 to 6 also show that turbulences in issuance of mature economies are also
affected by U.S. stock market volatility and fluctuations in U.S. economic activity. This is also
the case, but to a lesser extent, for emerging economies. For mature economies, the results
indicate that higher volatility in equity prices fuels turbulence in both bond and equity market
issuance. Finally, the results of these figures suggest that volatility of mature-economy issuance
tends to be procyclical, increasing in times of higher U.S. output growth; this could be due to
positive momentum in investors’ strategies, as suggested in Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers
(1995).
Tables 7 to 9 complement the results in Figures 4 to 6, by showing the variance
decomposition of volatility of issuance in bond, equity, and syndicated loans for mature and
emerging economies. These tables highlight the importance of the volatility of U.S. interest rates,
which explains on average 10 percent of the variance across instruments in both mature and
emerging economies. In contrast, the volatility of the U.S. stock market explains a high
proportion of variance in mature, but not in emerging economies (10 percent versus 2 percent22).
A similar picture emerges for U.S. GNP growth (9 and 4 percent of variance explained in mature
and emerging economies). U.S. inflation, instead, explains a relatively small proportion of
variance both in mature economies and in emerging ones (4 percent and 2 percent).
Overall, as shown in the last columns of Tables 7 to 9, shocks to U.S. real and financial
fundamentals explain a significantly higher proportion of the variance of issuance of mature
economies than of that of emerging economies (34 percent versus 18 percent, on average). This
evidence suggests that domestic shocks and not external disturbances are more important in
20

The exception is the syndicated-loan market.

These numbers are the averages across markets (for all horizons) of the numbers reported in Figures 6 to 8.

explaining the changes in the ability of emerging economies to gain access to international
capital markets. This evidence agrees with the results in Kaminsky (2006), which classifies
crises in a variety of emerging and mature economies. In that paper, it is shown that crises in
emerging markets tend to be of a different variety than those in mature markets. In particular, it
is found that all crises in emerging economies occur in the midst of multiple domestic
vulnerabilities: A fragile banking sector, bubbles in stock and real estate markets, liabilitydollarization, and debt problems. Naturally, a devaluation in these circumstances triggers a
collapse of the economy. In contrast, domestic vulnerabilities are much less pronounced in
mature economies. For this reason, a currency crisis in mature economies tends to promote
growth, as competitiveness improves following the devaluation.

4 Conclusions

In this paper, we have analyzed the time-varying pattern of volatility of gross issuance in
the international bond, equity, and syndicated-loan markets between 1980 and 2005. These are
our main findings:

1. There is a boom-bust pattern in the volatility of issuance over the short run both in
emerging and mature economies. Outbursts of volatility of emerging-economy
issuance in international markets are mostly linked to currency crises.
2. In the long run, volatility of issuance has significantly declined in all the markets and
regions that we study. Such a decline, however, has been more pronounced for mature
economies.
3. There is evidence that the time-varying volatility of issuance around the world can in
part be explained by real and financial developments in the financial center. In
particular, the lower volatility of U.S. monetary policy and interest rates has
significantly contributed to stabilize the pattern of issuance in financial markets
throughout the world.
4. Shocks in the financial center explain a large share of volatility of mature-economy
issuance in international markets. In contrast, most of the volatility of the emergingperiphery issuance in international markets is explained by domestic factors. This

11

result agrees with the findings of the literature on financial crises, which indicate that
financial turmoil in emerging economies is mainly triggered by domestic and
financial vulnerabilities and not by external shocks.

From a policy point of view, the implications of our findings appear to be significant. In
particular, our results indicate that more stable monetary policies in mature economies have
contributed not only to more stable economies in industrial countries23 but also to less erratic
international financial markets.
Nevertheless, our results for emerging economies suggest that in order for these
economies to gain continuous access to international capital markets, they should address
domestic vulnerabilities.

Therefore, international institutions have correctly stressed that

emerging economies should follow conservative macroeconomic policies and reform institutions.
It has also been pointed out that emerging economies tend to follow procyclical macroeconomic
policies,24 fueling increases in the volatility of economic activity and triggering lending booms
that often end up in financial crashes. To avoid instability of the domestic economy, emerging
countries need to find arrangements that will enable policy makers to conduct neutral or even
counter-cyclical policies.25

23

See, for instance, Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000) and Romer and Romer (2002). See also the remarks by Vice
Chairman Roger W. Ferguson, Jr. to the Banco de Mexico International Conference, Mexico City, Mexico.

24

In contrast, mature economies tend to follow countercyclical polices, which tend to stabilize the business cycle.
See, for example, Kaminsky, Reinhart, and Végh (2004).

25

There is some evidence that some emerging economies have been able to “graduate” from the procyclical group
and conduct neutral or even countercyclical fiscal policies (see Calderón and Schmidt-Hebbel (2003)). In the
particular case of Chile, the adoption of fiscal rules specifically designed to encourage public saving in good times
may have helped in this endeavor.

Dotted lines represent 90-percent confidence intervals.

Impulse responses are measured as the response of volatility to a one-percentage point increase in the variable being shocked (e.g., if U.S. growth increases by
one-percentage point, mature economies' issuance volatility increases by half-percentage point on impact).
