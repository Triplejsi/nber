Air Pollution and Lost Work

ABSTRACT

A Poisson

specification of the relationship between atmospheric

pollution and lost work days is

procedure

estimated.

An important feature of the

is control for city—specific effects. A major source of

ambiguity in interpreting the results of observational data on pollution

versus health status or death rates is that pollution in a city may be
with other characteristics of

correlated

that city that affect these

but are not controlled for in the analysis. Or, individual
attributes of residents may be correlated with pollution levels but not
accounted for in the analysis. Our results suggest a statistically
outcomes

significant

and quantitatively important effect of total suspended

particulates on work days lost. A standard deviation increase in total
suspended particulates is associated with approximately a ten percent
increase in work days lost. As a concomitant of our analysis, we also
find a substantial relationship between smoking by others in the
individual's household and work days lost by non-smokers.

AIR POLLUTION

Analysis of the effects of air pollution on health must rely in

large part on observational survey data. While there is growing
evidence on the relationship between air pollution and health, the
observational studies perforce leave considerable doubt about the causal

effects of pollution. The lingering and important question is whether
attributes of individuals or their surroundings other than pollution,
that could have caused the observed relationship, have been adequately

controlled. What is the effect of left out variable bias? Two
advantages of our study we hope will reduce this range of uncertainty.
First, we use microdata that contain information on more individual
attributes than were available to other investigators, helping to reduce

excluded variable bias. Second, we use statistical techniques that
allow us to control for unmeasured site effects. Though the potential
effects of air pollution are manifold, we analyze work days lost to

focus attention on a direct economic cost
attempt to compare the total costs and

of

pollution. We niake no

benefits

of pollution reduction,

however.

Several previous studies have related pollution to mortality

rates. Possibly the most widely cited work is by Lave and Seskin
[19711 ,

who base their analysis on aggregate cross—section data for

standard metropolitan statistical areas. The major reservation about
their work has been the potential effect of unmeasured city
characteristics, a motivation for several subsequent studies that

addressed particular issues. Mendelsohn and Orcutt [1979] paid
particular attention to migration, Crocker et al., [1979] and Gregor
[19771

to

medical care, and Lipfert [1980] to other socieoeconomic

characteristics. Nonetheless, the effect of unmeasured city

characteristics has rnained a mjor source of uncertainty. The
relationship of pollution to morbidity, which is closer to our work days
lost measure, was

addressed

by Crocker et al, [19791 using Michigan

Survey Research Center interview data, by Graves and Krunim [19811 who

analyzed Cook County, Illinois emergency room data, and by Seskin [1979]

who studied visits to health clinics in Washington, D.C. Other
researchers addressing the morbidity effects of pollution have monitored
individuals over relatively long periods of tiine. Lunn et al. [19671

found a significant relationship between respiratory illness and air
pollution among children in Sheffield, England and Ferris 119731 and

—3—

Bouhuys et al. [19T8] found pollution related to respiratory disease
symptoms among adults. The closest to ours is that of Ostro 119831 , who
analyzed the relationship between air pollut ion and work days lost using

the annual data described below, but using a more standard statistical
procedure that did not allow control for city effects.
In short, while the evidence for a relationship between

pollution and health is substantial judgments about the causal effect
are clouded by uncertainty about the effect of unmeasured city—specific
characteristics and the inability to control for differences among

individuals in the same area. For example, more polluted areas may have
more blue collar workers whose occupations are unusually dangerous, or
polluted

areas may also have more firms that offer employee fringe

benefits like sick leave that encourage sick days. Studies that follow
the same individual

over time have been restricted to possibly

unrepresentative samples. While the evidence from epidemiologic data

must by its very nature be circumstantial,

we believe that by

statistical correction for city—specific effects and by better data on
individual attributes, we are able to reduce the range of uncertainty.
Our analysis addresses the relationship between work days lost
and atmospheric air pollution. Estimates are based on a series of
national surveys of individuals conducted weekly during 1976, a

time—series of cross—section surveys. In particular, survey respondents
were asked how many days of work they lost due to illness or injury

—'4 —

during the prior two—week period. Because the number of work days lost

most often zero and always a small integer count, statistical
estimation is based on the Poisson model. To allow for individual
differences, the Poisson (centrality) parameter is specified as a
is

function

of individual attributes and environmental characteristics.

Because we have a number of observations for the same city at several
different times in the year, we are able to control for unobserved city

effects, based on procedures set forth in Griliches,

Hall, and Hausman

[1981].
The statistical model is described in Section I. We begin with
a simple Poisson "regression" model and then extend it to account for

unobserved city effects. Parameter estimates are presented in Section
II. Simple Poisson estimates are presented first, followed by results

based on the fixed effect model. All model specifications indicate an
important effect of air pollution on work days lost. As a concomitant
of our analysis, and consistent with this result, we also find that
cigarette smoking by others in the household also bears a strong
relationship to work days lost by non—smokers in the household.
Concluding discussion is in Section III.

B. A Fixed Effect Specification
One of the major problems of drawing conclusions based on city
pollution variables is that unmeasured city characteristics that are
correlated

with pollution may

health, or persons that live
that determine their

status, or, more specificaLly for our purposes, the likelihood

that they will miss work days. A variance components specification is a
common way to address this problem in regression analysis. The fixed

—T —

effect

version of this specification is often implemented by considering

the deviation of individual observations fran their group (e.g. city)

means. The idea
abstracted

is to

explain differences within the group, having

procedure here, conditioning on the total number of work days lost in

probability that it is incurred by individual j in time period t. Then

Empirical Results
We begin with a discussion of the data and then present

estimates based on the simple Poisson model. The first estimates are
based on annual average pollution levels. Presumably these averages are
the best indication of typical polJiition in a city. Estimates based on

average pollution levels over two—week periods are also presented. The
two—week ,readings allow comparison of the relationships between work

days lost and alternative past levels of pollution, and as we explain

below provide a base for comparison with the fixed effect estimates.6
Before presenting the fixed effect estimates, however, we test the
sensitivity of our results to the Poisson restriction that given X the

variance of n is equal to its expected value. To do this we present

least squares estimates that are ccnsistent, although not
efficient, under rather general assumptions on the variance structure.
non—linear

Having concluded that our results are not unduely affected by the

Poisson variance restriction, we next present the fixed effect results.
Because

these estimates address a major concern inherent in all analysis

based on observational data of this sort, we believe them to be the most
reliable, with the limitation however, that

only two-week

pollution

levels can be used, Thus we also present fixed effect estimates using
several lagged values of pollution, under the assumption that the sum of
the coefficients on past pollution levels provides a reasonable

likely to be specific to particular effects of pollution and is likely
to vary among individuals depending on health status. We have not
attempted to pursue the details of potential mechanisms.

—11—

indication

of the effect of average annual pollution. In addition to

the effect of pollution on work days lost, the estimated relationship

between work days lost and other individual attributes is also of

interest. We discuss these relationships within the context of the
fixed effect specification.

Estimation

is based on individual data collected

through

the

1976 Health Interview Survey (HIS) conducted by the National Center for

Health Statistics. These data were

nrged with 1976 Enviromnental

Protection Agency- (EPA) data on ambient pollution and, with National

Oceanic and Atmoseric Administration (NOAA) data on weather

conditions, and with
The

Census Bureau data on other urban characteristics.

HIS is a stratified randan survey of 50,000 households

comprising about 120,000 individuals. Information is obtained on
economic and demographic attributes of respondents, acute and chronic
Illnesses (identified by dIagnosis), days of medical disability, work
days

missed because of

illness, cigarette consumption, family

income,

occupation, education, and other individual attributes. All respondents
living in 85 medium sized cities were selected for this analysis. The
cities, most with populations between 100 and 600 thousand, provide
geographic distribution and pollut ion levels that span the entire range

among U.S. cities, although they do not represent a random sample of

pollution levels. Our analysis also pertains to men aged 18 to 65 who
are employed, and who do not smoke. About 5500 observations are
included in the analysis.

—12—

The EPA pollution data (SAROAD) provide measures on ambient
levels of several pollutants in these cities, including total suspended

particulates (TSP), sulfur dioxide (so2), and sulfates (son). We use
the particulates measure. Pollutant measurements are based on
recordings from 2k—hour hi—vol samplers intended to measure outdoor

pollution in residential areas. Marr cities have only one
"population—oriented"

monitor. Others have more. Where there is

more

than one, an average of monitor observations is used. In addition,
central city residents were matched with central city monitors and those
in suburban locations were matched with monitors in those areas.

In addition to pollution, we suppose that work days lost may be
affected by personal attributes such as age, health status, family
income, race, occupation and by environmental characteristics such as

temperature. The variables used are defined as follows:

Pollution Annual: Average annual ambient TSP level over the year in the
city of residence, in ug per cubic meter.

onj: Average ambient TSP level over the two-week period
ending n weeks before the time of the interview (e.g. Pollution Lag 1
pertains to the 5th and. 6th weeks before the interview), in ug per cubic
meter.

In years.

Familr Income:

Annual

income in 1000's.

—13—

Married:

One if married (and living with a spouse), zero otherwise.

Sjouse Works: One if man's wife works, zero otherwise.

Blue Collar Job: One if the person has a blue collar job, zero otherwise.

Industry Sick Leave: The proportion of workers nationwide in the
industry in which the individual works who are covered by sick leave

provisions.

Non—White: One if non—white, zero otherwise.

Chronic Conditions: One if the person has a chronic health condition,
zero otherwise.

Household Cigarettes: Total number of cigarettes smoked per day by
others living in the household in which the individual lives.

Population Density: Population (1977) per square mile in the
individual's city of residence, in thousands.

Average Temperature: Average annaal temperature in the city of
residence.

Minimum Temperature: Minimum temperature in the city of residence
during the two—week period prior to the interview.

January—March: One if the two—week period is in January, February, or
March, zero otherwise.

_l14

April—June: Analogous to above.

July—September: Analogous to above.

The means and standard deviations of the variables are shown in

Table l. Recall that our sample includes non—smokers only, so that
household cigarettes are those smoked by other people in the house in
which the individual lives.

B. Poisson Parameter Estimates
Estimates based on the simple Poisson model are shown in Table

2. Average annual pollution is used in the first two specifications.
The second includes seasonal variables, while the first does not. As
shall be explained below, we cannot estimate (two—week) period—specific
effects and still estimate a pollution effect for that period, although

we shall correct for city—specific effects. The seasonal variables can
be thought of as more aggregated period—specific effects. Comparison of
specification 1 with 2 reveals that including the seasonal variables has

little effect on the other estimates. In particular the estimated
pollution coefficient does not change appreciably when the seasonal
variables are added.

The estimated coefficient on annual pollution based in
specification 2 is 0.0071 and is measured very precisely, with a

Tme sample sizes vary somewhat with alternative specifications. The
means reported pertain to the specifications in Table 2.

standard error of about 0.0008. Since mA =

that a unit (ug/m )

X,

this specification

in annual average TSP would

increase the expected number of work days lost

0.7 percent. The mean

of the annual pollution variable is 68.36, with a standard deviation of

16.1; its minimum is 39.5 and its maximum 133.1. Thus a two—standard—
deviation reduction in pollution would reduce expected days lost by
approximately 23 percent, almost one and a half days per year evaluated

at the nan of days lost. The mean of work days lost per two—week
interval is 0.24, or 6.24 per year. Thus according to these estimates,
ambient TSP bears a quantitatively important relation to work days
lost.

If outdoor suspended particulate pollution is associated with
morbidity, one might expect a similar association with indoor air
pollution to which cigarette smoke may be an important contributor.8
The estimated coefficient of .011 on cigarettes smoked by others in the
household implies that an increase of 20 cigarettes per day, a pack, is
associated with a 22 percent increase in work days lost by non—smokers.
An increase of two standard deviations is associated with a 26 percent

increase in days lost by non—smokers. Of course, not all cigarettes
smoked by others in the liousehold are smoked in the house when the nonsmoker is present.

8See Repace and Lowry [19811.

The coefficients on the other variables are also of interest
and we shall discuss them with reference to the estimates below that

correct for city—specific effects. Although the orders of magnitude of
the estimates are righly the same as these, some of the estimates
change noticeably. Since the later estimates should be preferred, we
shall emphasize them.9

The remaining specifications in Table 2 use average pollution

levels over two—week periods, with alternative time lags. These results
provide

a base with which to canpare the fixed effects results presented

below. With this canparison in mind, the population density and average
temperature variables have been deleted and

the two—week minimum tem-

perature variable has been added. City variables that do not change
over time cancelled out of the analysis along with the unmeasured city
specific effect and thus it is impossible to estimate parameters

associated with them. The alternative time lags are motivated by the
possibility that pollution in the past may contribute to illness in the

future. We know of no theoretical rationale for a particular lag

structure, however. Thus we experimented with several. Two are
reported.

While the coefficient on any

individual

two—week value is

considerably lower than the estimated effect of annual pollution, the
sum of

the lagged coefficients in specification 1 is close to the annual

Although we believe that

unmeasured

city effects could be a

potential major source of bias in these results, the Poisson model

itself implies functional form restrictions that also could affect the
results. In particular, the variance of work days lost, given X, is
presumed to be equal to the expected value of days lost. Therefore,
before we proceed we shall test the sensitivity of our

results

to this

constraint, using specification 2 in Table 2 as a base for comparison.

C. Sensitivity to the Poisson Specification
While the Poisson model is in some ways ideally suited to these

data, it also imposes restrictions on the estimates. Given X, the
variance of the outcome is assumed to be equal to its mean. To test the
sensitivity of our estimated pollution effect to this restriction, we
present estimates based on alternative specifications that are not
restricted by this assumption.
To motivate the approach, recall that equation (14)

implies

that

estimates of the Poisson model could be obtained by maximum likelihood,
as we have done, or by a non—linear weighted least squares procedure.

In particular, suppose that the basic model is specified as

standard error is much larger. Given that the Poisson specification is

correct, though, the two estimates have the same probability limit. A
large

sanle test, based on the difference of the coefficient estimates

divided by the standard deviation of the estimated difference, yields a

test

statistic of 0.53, which is far below standard significance

levels.11 However, some of the other coefficients——such as the effect of

cigaretteshave changed markedly, although again the NLLS estimates are
much less precise than those based on the Poisson assumption.
Thus, as another test of our specification we compare jointly

Some details of this weighted

estimation procedure are provided in the appendix.

Estimates based on this specification are shown in column 2 of

Table 3. The estimated coefficient on annual pollution in this case is
0.0079, as compared with the Poisson estimate of 0.0080. Thus the
pollution estimates seem to be reasonably stable with respect to the
variance assumption, although again all parameters are measured with much

less precision than when the Poisson distribution is assumed. When we

3 of Table 2. The coefficient on pollution 14 weeks earlier is now .059,

with a standard error of .007, as compared with .0052 in the simple

Poisson mndel. The specification in column 5 uses three lagged values
of pollution. All are statistically different from zero by standard
criteria. Their sum is .0088, close to the annual pollution coefficient
of .0071 in column 2 of Table 1.

Thus it seems reasonable to conclude that our estimates suggest
that a standard deviation increase in pollution is associated with
approximately a 10 percent increase in work days lost.

As in the simple Poisson model, the results here also suggest a
substantial effect of cigarettes smoked by others in the household on
work days lost. The coefficient in column 3 of Table 14 is 0.0115, with

a standard error of (0.0018). This estimate indicates that 20 more
cigarettes are associated with approximately a 23 percent increase in

days missed. While the effect of smoking has not been the focus of our
analysis here, this result seems to support other evidence that the

effect of cigarette smoking is not limited to the smoker. Recent
literature has suggested a significant health impact from the breathing

of air polluted with tobacco smoke [Repace, 19811. This air, called
passive smoke, is believed to be chemically identical to mainstream

smoke and generally more concentrated [Hoegg, 19721. Past research has
also indicated that passive smoke is associated with greater incidence
of respiratory problems in children [Spiezer et al., 1980; Bonham and

—2 4—

Wilson,

1981; Tager et al., 19791

and greater risk of respiratory

conditions and cancer among non—smoking spouses [Hirayarna, 1981; and
Kauffman, 19801.

The estimates in column 3 also indicate that married men miss

23 percent fewer days than the unmarried. Married men whose wives work
miss 28 percent fewer days than those whose wives do not work. Blue
collar workers miss 18 percent fewer days on average than those in other

occupations. Not surprisingly, those with a chronic health condition
miss about twice as maay days as those who report no such condition.
Non—whites miss about -o

percent fewer days than whites. Some of these

differences, of course, may be due to differences in the types of job

held by different groups. The larger the fraction of workers in the
person's industry that are covered by sick leave provisions, the greater

the number of work days lost. Older workers miss more days than younger
ones.

E. Some Additional Results
In addition to the analysis reported in the paper, we also made
preliminary comparisons using alternative samples and pollution

definitions. For a sample of 763

smokers,

we estimated the same

specification as in Table 2, column 1. The estimated coefficient on
annual pollution was 0.0125 (with a standard error of 0.0032), compared

to the comparable estimate of 0.0071 for non—smokers. This result is

—25—

consistent with the hypothesis that pollution has a greater adverse

affect on smokers than on non—smokers. Medical evidence suggests that
smoking damages the body filters that would otherwise filter out some

ambiant particulate pollution. On the other hand, one might hypothesize
that if an individual smokes himself, the additional effect of the
cigarette smoke from others in the household may not be substantial.

For smokers, we obtain an estimated coefficient on cigarettes smoked by
others that is not significantly different from zero (—.0014, with a
standard error of .00514, versus .011, with a standard error of .0010 for
non—smokers).

We also estimated the specification of Table 2, column 1 for

persons who reported at least one respiratory condition. For this
group, the coefficient on annual pollution was 0.010 (with a standard
error of .ooi14), compared with 0.007 for the whole group.l6 If work days
lost is defined to include only days missed due to illness, and not
injuries, the coefficient on annual pollution is .008 (with a standard
error of .0008).

Because of the number and location of pollution irnitors, our
data for total particulates is much more reliable than the data for
other pollulants or for 'components of the total. Nonetheless, we

—26—

estimated separate coefficients for each. In our data, sulfates
comprise about 13 percent of TSP. The coefficient on TSP in this
specification remained large and significant (O.Oi with a standard
error of O.OOi1), but the coefficient on sulfates was not significantly

different from zero. Further work remains to be done using better data
on individual poiiutants.'T

F. Conclusion
We have estimated a Poisson specification of the relationship

between atmospheric pollution and lost work days. An important feature
of our procedure is control for city specific effects. A major source
of ambiguity in interpreting the results of observational data on
pollution versus health status or death rates is that pollution in a
city may be correlated with other characteristics of that city that

affect these outcomes but are not controlled for in the analysis. Or,
individual attributes of residents may be correlated with pollution

levels but not accounted for in the analysis. Our data set allows us to
control explicitly for many more individual attributes than were

available to st previous researchers in this area. But in addition we
have controlled for othei unmeasured city specific effects that could be

correlated with pollution levels. Thus we believe that our analysis
reduces substantially the uncertainty attendant on standard analysis of
the effects of pollution based on observational data.

lost. A standard deviation increase in TSP is associated with

approximately a 10 percent increase in work days lost. According to
these results if, in areas where pollution is very high, say two
standard deviations above the mean, pollution were reduced to the mean,

work days lost would be reduced by over 20 percent. As a concomittant
of our analysis, we also found a substantial relationship between
smoking by others in the individuals household and work days lost by

non—smokers. Finally, the effect of atmospheric pollution on smokers
appears to be greater than on non—smokers according to our results.

thought more closely matched individuals to monitors typically yielded
higher estimated pollution effects, as errors in variable seasoning
would suggest.
