ABSTRACT
The rate of regional growth of new knowledge in the field of nanotechnology, as measured by counts
of articles and patents in the open-access digital library NanoBank, is shown to be positively affected
both by the size of existing regional stocks of recorded knowledge in all scientific fields, and the extent
to which tacit knowledge in all fields flows between institutions of different organizational types. The
level of federal funding has a large, robust impact on both publication and patenting. The data provide
further support for the cumulative advantage model of knowledge production, and for ongoing efforts
to institutionalize channels through which cross-organizational collaboration may be achieved.

MINERVA UNBOUND: KNOWLEDGE STOCKS, KNOWLEDGE FLOWS AND NEW
KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION
Lynne G. Zucker, Michael R. Darby, Jonathan Furner, Robert C. Liu, and Hongyan Ma
1. Introduction
What factors influence the rates at which new knowledge is produced in technological
fields? The particular study reported in this paper is part of a more general research program
driven by this question, whereby we seek to understand the processes that determine the
productivity of authors and inventors in new technology, as measured by counts of articles and
patents (see, e.g., Zucker, Darby, & Brewer, 1998; Zucker, Darby, & Armstrong, 2002). In the
study reported here, our counts of documents are obtained by statistical analysis of the contents
of NanoBank, an open-access digital library of articles and patents in the field of nanotechnology
(Zucker & Darby, 2006). Our approach is guided by a theoretical conception of the production of
scientific knowledge as an activity that is deeply embedded in a complex network of social
structures and practices, and that the forms taken by these structures and practices are crucial
determinants of the forms taken by knowledge production in later periods in the same place.
While it is conventional to refer to science as cumulative, we argue and demonstrate that there is
a significant cumulative effect even when the knowledge produced is discontinuous and
revolutionary in some respects.
We present the results of tests of two related hypotheses. The first of these is that the
frequency of publication, during a given period and in a given geographical region, of articles
and patents relating to nanotechnology is correlated with the size of the existing “knowledge
stock” of all other (non-nanotechnology) articles and patents in all fields of science previously
published in that region. The second hypothesis is that the frequency of publication, during a

1

given period and in a given geographical region, of articles and patents relating to
nanotechnology is correlated with the extent to which articles and patents in the existing
knowledge stock of the region are co-authored by affiliates of institutions of different
organizational types.
The results of our tests allow us to draw two sets of conclusions. In the first place, we are
able to differentiate the respective merits of two competing kinds of claim about the ways in
which existing knowledge stocks affect the evolution of new fields of knowledge such as
nanotechnology. In the second place, we are able both to evaluate, on the basis of their impact on
productivity, ongoing efforts to institutionalize channels through which cross-institutional
collaboration (or “knowledge flow”) may be achieved, and to demonstrate the utility of a method
by which the impact of stocks of tacit knowledge (as opposed to that of stocks of recorded
knowledge) may be estimated.
In the course of our investigations of the links between knowledge stocks, knowledge
flows, and knowledge production, we are also able to assess the impact (on productivity of
knowledge in nanotechnology) of the cumulative stock of funding dollars awarded by the
National Science Foundation (NSF) to nanotechnology projects initiated by institutions in a
given region.
The paper is structured as follows. Firstly, we contextualize our hypotheses by
considering the impact, on the production of new knowledge, of general knowledge stocks
(Section 2), and of barriers to the flow of knowledge across institutional boundaries (Section 3).
We then provide a justification of our focus on geographically localized knowledge flow
(Section 4), before describing our methods of measuring knowledge (Section 5), of identifying
“nano-relevant” documents (Section 6), and of categorizing those documents by organizational

2

type and geographical region (Section 7). In Section 8, we describe our methods of data analysis;
in Section 9, we present the results of the tests of our first hypothesis, about the impact of
knowledge stocks; and in Section 10, we present the results of the tests of our second hypothesis,
about the impact of knowledge flows. Finally, we draw our conclusions (Section 11).

2. General knowledge stocks: Their impact on the production of new knowledge
Researchers in the economics of scientific knowledge have long been concerned to assess
the impact of knowledge production on economic growth (see, e.g., Stephan, 1996; Foray, 2004).
How closely do measurements of the rates at which new knowledge is produced correlate with
measurements of the rates at which the economy grows as a whole? A number of production
functions have been proposed that model the relationship between output quantities of goods and
services and input quantities of knowledge. Considerable attention has also been paid to the task
of identifying the conditions under which rates of knowledge production (and thus economic
productivity in general) can increase most rapidly. Correspondingly, production functions have
been developed that may be used to predict the rate at which new knowledge will be produced in
the future (see, e.g., Adams, 1990).
Comprehensive functions of this latter kind typically quantify inputs of three principal
types: time, physical resources, and human (i.e., intellectual) resources. In practice, the
intellectual capital accessible to an institution includes both (i) knowledge that is recorded or
codified in documents, and (ii) the tacit knowledge or know-how that is stored only in the minds
of the institution’s scientists and researchers. Research in economics (see, e.g., Griliches, 1990)
suggests that the impact of cumulated general knowledge stocks (i.e., knowledge capital) on the
production of new knowledge is positive. In other words, the larger the existing cumulated stock

3

of general knowledge, the faster new knowledge is produced: rates of production of new
knowledge increase in direct proportion to sizes of stocks of existing knowledge. Such a finding
supports the general claim, widely accepted by economists, that scientific knowledge is strongly
cumulative (see, e.g., Stigler, 1983; Machlup, 1984). According to the cumulative advantage
model of the knowledge production process, having one idea increases the likelihood of having
another: knowledge begets knowledge.
The validity of the cumulative advantage model has been questioned from various
perspectives. On one hand, it is criticized for its reliance on the assumption that the existing
knowledge base consists of propositions about the world that are themselves true. Work in the
history and philosophy of science (HPS) and science and technology studies (STS) tends to
emphasize the sharp continuity breaks in the evolution of fields of knowledge that are observed
to follow breakthrough discoveries (see, e.g., Kuhn, 1962), and thus to suggest that the size of
existing knowledge stocks is either irrelevant for predictions of future knowledge productivity,
or even negatively correlated in the sense that the existence of large stocks of prior general
knowledge actively retards the making and acceptance of discoveries in new fields.
From another perspective, the cumulative advantage model has been attacked for failing
to take into account the gradual obsolescence (and depreciation in economic value) of
knowledge, and the variation in obsolescence rates among fields. Nevertheless, the correlation
between size of existing knowledge stock and rate of production of new knowledge has been
observed even when the value of previously-produced knowledge is discounted (conventionally
by 20% per year) to reflect the way in which older knowledge becomes obsolete over time (see,
e.g., Griliches, 1990).

4

Thirdly, it has been argued that the positive externalities of knowledge in a given field are
most frequently restricted or localized to third parties working in that field -- i.e., that the stock
of knowledge produced in one field has little impact on the rate of production of new knowledge
in other fields (see, e.g., Antonelli, 2001).
The study described in this paper supplies data that can be interpreted as further evidence
of the validity of the cumulative advantage model, addressing in particular the third criticism
mentioned above. We report measurements of (i) the size of prior stocks of knowledge in all
fields, and (ii) the rate of production of new knowledge in the field of nanotechnology, and find
that the correlation between sets of measurements of the two kinds is typically positive. We
believe that this finding reflects the capability of disruptive, breakthrough discoveries in science
still to draw upon, or at least not contradict, some of the concepts, formulae, and machines
developed in pre-existing science. While some elements in pre-existing science may be radically
changed or eliminated, other old elements are imported largely unchanged, while still others are
transformed by their use for new purposes, yielding hybrid elements that mix old and new.

3. Barriers to the flow of knowledge across institutional boundaries: Their impact on the
production of new knowledge
A much remarked property of knowledge as an economic good is that it is capable of
"spillover": it may be acquired and used freely by people working in institutions other than those
in which the knowledge originates, while the originating institution retains access to that
knowledge but receives no further compensation for its diffusion (see, e.g., Arrow, 1962).
Knowledge production is thus said to generate "positive externalities" or benefits for third
parties. Codified knowledge flows through text books, scientific equipment, and lecture hall

5

presentations. Tacit knowledge is embodied in the person and is communicated with great
difficulty, often by doing research together with the person learning. The freedom for tacit
knowledge to flow across institutional boundaries is frequently identified as one of the essential
conditions under which rates of knowledge production can increase most rapidly.
Ideally, the intellectual capital input to a knowledge production function should account
not only for stocks of recorded knowledge but also for stocks of tacit knowledge. Recorded
knowledge may be quantified using counts of publications (and perhaps qualified, more
controversially, by weighting publication counts by counts of the citations made to those
publications by other authors). It has proven more difficult, on the other hand, to measure stocks
of tacit knowledge. Nevertheless, since there is evidence to suggest that researchers’ engagement
in collaborative activity is the principal way in which tacit knowledge is generated and shared,
collaboration contains evidence of likely significant tacit knowledge stocks, once value and skill
differentiation are controlled.
The simplest and most commonly occurring process by which knowledge is transferred
across institutional boundaries involves people from different institutions interacting with one
another, and (more specifically) collaborating on projects whose results include the production of
some new knowledge. Micro-institutional approaches look at the social construction process,
including transmission of knowledge and information (Zucker 1977) and “institutionalization
projects” (DiMaggio 1982a and b).
Co-authoring across institutional boundaries serves to connect the two organizations,
while simultaneously converting each co-author into quasi-members of the other co-authors’
organizations, such that a subsequent promotion of one of the authors may include a letter of
evaluation from an external collaborator (Zucker, 1991; Gartrell, 1987). This process of external

6

evaluation of job performance also occurs in firms, e.g. investment banks where externally
collected survey data from clients is used to determine bonuses and promotions (Eccles & Crane,
1988). Action becomes embedded in the virtual space created by the social network (Powell,
1990). Thus, the deepening of channels or conduits for the flow of knowledge can serve as a
catalyst for changes in the degree and type of social embeddedness of knowledge-production
activity.
As the frequency and number of different scientists working with each other across
institutional boundaries increases, the “gap” between institutions may begin to be converted into
a “glissando” (Tyree, Semyonov, & Hodge, 1979). When this kind of boundary change occurs
repeatedly across institutions of two organizational types (e.g., university and firm), the social
distance between the two types is reduced and institutional differentiation may decrease,
changing the context in which action is embedded. For new knowledge to have an impact, and
perhaps become taken-for-granted, the knowledge not only needs to be produced, but also
transmitted to others. Pre-existing practices of co-authorship and collaboration provide existing
channels along which the new information is likely to flow. These collaborations can be viewed
as micro-joint ventures, where success encourages more joint work, further embedding persons
in cross-organizational contexts. As the number of these “micro-JVs” adds up, the cumulative
effects may operate like an organization-level joint venture, and lead to a move to the other
organization by one of the scientists.
The factors considered by researchers when choosing whether or not to engage in
collaborative knowledge-production activity are various. Whatever the factors that are perceived
by individuals as incentives in particular contexts, the force of such incentives is typically
diminished by the existence of barriers to collaboration, such as the absence (or unreliability) of

7

formalized structures of the kinds that might support cross-institutional interaction. It is clear, for
instance, that the prior lack of channels for cross-institutional communication is a strong
disincentive to collaborate on cross-institutional research, with the result that institutional
boundaries function as knowledge envelopes, preventing knowledge from leaving the institution
in which it was produced (Zucker et al., 1996).
In our prior work, we have examined the effects of direct ties, measured as numbers of
articles co-authored by scientists in universities and scientists in firms, on commercialization of
basic science discoveries made in universities (Zucker, Darby, & Armstrong, 1998; 2002; Zucker
& Darby, 2001). It is not yet equally clear, however, what impact the prior existence of channels
for cross-institutional communication has on the rate at which knowledge is produced in new
fields. It might be hypothesized that the depth of such channels is positively correlated with
knowledge productivity – in other words, that the more frequently cross-institutional
collaboration has occurred (and knowledge has flowed) in the past, the greater quantity of
knowledge will be produced in the immediate future. In this paper, we investigate this hypothesis
in relation to the field of nanotechnology, reporting our findings that the absence of barriers to
the flow of general (i.e., “non-nano”) knowledge in the past has a positive impact on the rate at
which new knowledge is produced in nanotechnology.

4. Geographically localized knowledge flow: A theory of localization
A stream of recent research on innovation in the U.S. has found evidence of “geographically
localized knowledge spillovers” occurring in areas around major universities (Jaffe, 1986; 1989;
Jaffe, Trajtenberg, & Henderson, 1993; Audretsch & Feldman, 1996; Henderson, Jaffe, &
Trajtenberg, 1998). The underlying assumption is that proximity to a major university itself

8

provides technological opportunity; the localization is assumed to be due to the social ties between
university and firm employees or to firm employees’ access to seminars at the university. The
importance of distance is strengthened by Adams and Jaffe’s (1996) finding that geographic
distance is an important impediment to flow of technology even within the firm.
Zucker, Darby, and Brewer (1998) and Darby and Zucker (2001) find that firms are more
likely to begin using biotechnology in U.S. and Japanese regions where and when “star”
bioscientists are actively publishing, respectively. Although these findings have been cited as
evidence of geographically localized knowledge spillovers, we read our results – and those of the
other authors cited above – as only demonstrating geographical localization of knowledge. Zucker,
Darby, and Armstrong (1998; 2002) and Zucker and Darby (2001) show for California, the U.S.,
and Japan, respectively, that university effects on nearby firm R&D productivity are highly
concentrated in the particular firms with bench-science working relationships with top academic
scientists and practically absent otherwise. We identify these academic--firm links by the academic
scientist publishing a journal article that also has one or more firm-affiliated authors. Fieldwork –
supported by analysis of the timing of the academic scientists’ first articles with a firm and its
founding -- indicates that these academic--firm co-publishing relationships most often connote that
the academic scientist was a firm founder or at least presently has a significant financial interest in
the firm. In our view, knowledge localization occurs because high levels of tacit knowledge
characteristic of high-science discoveries require inventor involvement for successful transfer to
firms. The implied temporary natural excludability produces high potential returns which help
motivate the involvement of top scientists in the commercial application of their discoveries.
This paper builds on this literature in two ways: First, we hypothesize that both recently
published and patented knowledge creation will have localized effects on the current production

9

of knowledge. Second, we hypothesize that it will be more difficult to engage in collaborations
across organizational type in a new area like nanotechnology in those local regions where there
is little prior precedent for such collaborations than in those regions with a more extensive
history of such collaborations. That is, the inherited institutional setting of a local region may
limit or enhance the ability of scientists and engineers to engage in productive collaborations
across organizational type.

5. Overcoming difficulties in the measurement of knowledge
The characteristics of knowledge that make it impossible for researchers to measure its
quantity (let alone its quality) directly are well documented (see, e.g., Foray, 2004). In this paper,
we adopt a strategy for measurement that will be familiar to sciento- and bibliometricians (see,
e.g., Hullmann & Meyer, 2003; Moed, Glänzel, & Schmoch, 2004): We use counts of articles
(i.e., articles published in the scientific literature) and counts of patents as separate indicators of
the quantities of knowledge produced in given fields, in given sectors, in given regions, in given
periods.
The limitations of such an approach are also well documented; suffice to say that we are
only too aware (i) that such counts obscure large variations in the quality of the knowledge
recorded in articles and patents, and (ii) that a large but unknown proportion of the knowledge
produced and used by researchers and by developers remains unrecorded in articles and patents.
One common response to the former observation is to weight publication counts in accordance
with counts of the citations received by publications. We have not made use of citation statistics
in this study since the nature of the relationship between citedness and quality is itself unclear.

10

We have been developing an open-access digital library of articles and patents in the field
of nanotechnology, covering all aspects of the science and technology of nanometer-scale
structures and systems (Zucker & Darby, 2006). Nanotechnology is an emergent, highly
interdisciplinary field. The criteria that we use when deciding whether or not to add a new article
or patent to NanoBank are described in Section 6.
Each of the records in NanoBank includes metadata that specify, inter alia, the date of the
article’s publication or the patent’s grant, the institutional affiliation of each of the article’s
authors or the patent’s assignees (and the addresses of named institutions), and any discipline(s)
or subject area(s) to which the article or patent has been assigned in previous acts of
classification. These metadata can then be processed by computer (using procedures described in
Section 7) in order to generate counts of articles and patents tabulated by year, by geographical
area, by organizational type, by subject area, and by type of cross-institutional collaboration.
These counts – indicating the rate of production of new knowledge in nanotechnology –
are then compared with counts of “non-nano” articles and patents that indicate the size of
existing general knowledge stocks. These latter counts are generated in a similar manner from
existing databases of general coverage produced by Thomson Scientific (formerly the Institute
for Scientific Information, Inc. -- ISI), and the United States Patent and Trademark Office
(USPTO).

6. Identifying nano-relevant documents
In order to populate NanoBank with articles and patents that treat topics related to
nanotechnology (i.e., that are “nano-relevant” or, simply, “nano”), we need to filter such
documents from initial universal sets of documents covering all subject areas. Nanotechnology is

11

an interdisciplinary endeavor, and nano-relevant documents may be found inhabiting many
disciplinary spaces, both expected and unexpected. The two universal document sets with which
we began are (for articles) the union of Science Citation Index Expanded™, Social Sciences
Citation Index®, and Arts & Humanities Citation Index® produced by Thomson Scientific, and
(for patents) the database of US patents produced by the Zucker-Darby Knowledge, Innovation,
and Growth Project. Thomson Scientific’s data cover more than 24 million articles from more
than 8,700 peer-reviewed journals; our patent data cover the 3,891,720 patents granted by the
USPTO from 1976 to 2005.
The fraction of the content of these document sets that is nano-relevant is substantial, so
the task of filtering nano-relevant documents is one that can be carried out only with automated
assistance. We use two separate methods of distinguishing documents that are “nano”: (a) Search
for the occurrence of terms in a predefined list of 379 terms identified by subject specialists as
nano-specific to indicate “nano.” We found this method to be less reliable in identifying the
latest and the earliest nano-relevant documents: the latest are more likely to include terms that
are too new to have made it on to our list, while the earliest were written before the terms on our
list were in common usage. (b) Discriminate between nano-relevant documents and others using
a probabilistic procedure for the automatic identification of those terms (Sebastiani, 2002). This
procedure is adaptive in the sense that it requires the computer to continuously learn from the
training data provided by prior sets of judgments of the relevance or non-relevance of
documents, and integrates techniques developed in the fields of information retrieval (IR),
machine learning (ML), and natural language processing (NLP).
We begin by assuming the nano-relevance of the articles that make up the Virtual Journal
of Nanoscale Science & Technology (a.k.a. VJNano; http://www.vjnano.org/), a weekly

12

compilation of the latest research on nanoscale systems whose contents is selected manually,
from a variety of source publications, by the members of an international editorial board. In the
technical vocabulary of IR, VJNano’s selection policy is analogous to the output of a search with
very high precision but potentially low recall: few, if any, non-nano articles are selected, but it is
not known how many nano-relevant articles are not selected.1 Our task is then to identify those
documents that have not been selected by VJNano but that are nevertheless nano-relevant; in
other words, we want to classify the non-VJNano literature into nano (relevant) and non-nano
(non-relevant). The terms that occur most frequently in VJNano (and that do not appear on a
stop-word list of terms that occur frequently in English text in general) are weighted according to
their frequencies and used in a query against a universal document set (Van Rijsbergen, 1979).
The system’s response to such a query is a list of documents ranked in order of their probability
of relevance. In a “blind” feedback process, we then assume the nano-relevance of the topranked documents, use data on the frequencies of occurrence of terms in those newly-identified
documents to modify the previous query, and submit the modified query against the universal
document set (Efthimiadis, 1996). We repeat the process until we converge on a relatively
consistent set of terms that changes little between iterations.
A refinement of this procedure involves the generation of separate ranked lists of highly
discriminating terms for different subject areas. Every journal indexed by Thomson Scientific,
for instance, is assigned to one or more subject categories, and every article appearing in a given
journal inherits the category or categories to which that journal has been assigned. We were able
to match with their counterparts in the Thomson Scientific databases 17,693 of the 22,732
articles appearing by December 2005 in VJNano, and then to generate a separate sub-classifier
(i.e., a relatively stable query that may be used to retrieve nano-relevant documents) for each of

13

the 235 subject categories to which Thomson Scientific’s articles are assigned. Sub-classifiers
can similarly be generated for each of the five categories of patent in the broad science and
technology classification scheme based on the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)
International Patent Classification (IPC) that is used in the USPTO database. Even more specific
sub-classifiers can be generated for every publication year.

7. Categorizing documents by organizational type and geographical region
Each Thomson Scientific record of an article includes fields that supply the name and
address of each of the institutions with which any of that article’s authors is affiliated; each
USPTO record of a patent includes fields that similarly supply the name and usually the address
of the institutional assignee-at-issue, and the home address of each inventor. We analyze the data
contained in these fields in order to categorize the knowledge-producing institutions by
organizational type or sector (i.e., as a firm, university / hospital, government / national
laboratory, research institute / national professional organization, “unclassified” [type not yet
determined]) and by geographical region. Institutions are classified by organizational type using
a sequential application of two methods: (i) the application of look-up tables, developed over
several years of automatic and manual processing, that match variant names to preferred names
and thence to organizational type; and (ii) keyword analysis for remaining unidentified
organizations that infers organizational type from certain of the words, phrases, and
abbreviations contained in an institution’s name (so that, for example, a name that includes
“Inc.” is classed as a firm). Addresses are classified by county and then by geographical region
using the Federal Information Processing Standard database (FIPS55;
http://geonames.usgs.gov/fips55.html) maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey, and definitions

14

of the 179 functional economic areas in the U.S. supplied by the U.S. Bureau of Economic
Analysis (Johnson & Kort, 2004).
Statistical analysis of the contents of NanoBank yields data on the numbers of nanorelevant articles published in each of 235 subject categories and patents granted in each of 5
subject categories, in each of 5 sectors, in each of 179 U.S. regions, in each of the 24 years from
1981 through 2004. If an article or patent is associated with more than one subject category,
organizational type, or region, each count is credited a fraction equivalent to the reciprocal of the
number of associated types or regions. If an article is co-authored by authors affiliated with
institutions of different organizational types within the same region, it is counted as an instance
of cross-institutional collaboration or “knowledge flow.” 2 Corresponding data on numbers of
non-nano articles and patents are derived by analyzing the residual contents (i.e., the contents left
after subtracting nano articles and patents) of the Thomson Scientific and USPTO databases.
Table 1 provides a summary of these data. Table 2 provides further detail on the relative
frequencies of articles whose co-authors span institutional boundaries.

8. Data analysis methodology
Our data analysis is performed on panel data – a time series of cross sections – comprised
of observations for each of the years 1981-2004 for each of the 179 U.S. functional economic
areas (i.e., central urban areas plus their suburbs and exurbs or “regions”) as defined by the U.S.
Bureau of Economic Analysis. Most of these regions have a relatively low rate of publication
and patenting while a smaller tail have much higher rates.
We analyze this data using Poisson regressions with random effects and robust standard
errors estimated using the xtpoisson procedure in the Stata 9.0 statistical package. This procedure
15

is both flexible and robust. For example, since the negative binomial is a special case of the
random effects model (Kennedy, 1998, pp. 247-248), it permits the data to choose that form
rather than have it imposed which potentially biases the coefficient estimates if the true model is
not negative binomial.3 Since we use the local region as the group variable in these estimations
we are fitting separate constants for each region and crediting the model with explanatory power
only to the extent that it explains variation over time relative to the mean rates of publication or
patenting for each region. This provides something of an acid test for the significance of the
coefficients individually and as a group or groups.
To be very specific, the general form of the random intercept Poisson model estimated by
xtpoission can be expressed by the following equations:
log( λij ) = β0 j +

K
k =1

βk X kij

(1)

β0 j = η00 + α 0 j

(2)

Taking (1) and (2) together, we have
log( λij ) = η00 +

K
k =1

βk X kij + α 0 j

(3)

where λij is the expected number of events occurred for the j th region at the i th year, β0 j
indicates an intercept that is random for each region, and α 0 j is an error term for the j th region
that follows a log-gamma distribution with mean zero.
Compared to a simple Poisson model estimated based on the pooled data, our estimator
allows for heterogeneity among regions by estimating the variance of α 0 j . When the estimated
variance is not significantly different from zero (i.e., when there is no heterogeneity among
regions), the estimator will give identical results as a simple Poisson regression. In our case, all

16

the estimated variances of α 0 j are significantly different from zero, which suggests that we
cannot treat observations from different regions as if observations from the same region, ignoring
the hierarchical nature of the data. Although a random intercept model does not explicitly
explore the source of heterogeneity (which is not the focus of the current paper), it nevertheless
takes it into account and gives adjusted estimates for regressors that we report.
We elected to use robust standard errors in order to provide t-statistics which are not
biased by deviations from the assumed parametric model. Nonetheless, in response to a comment
by an anonymous referee, we report alternative estimates in the Appendix based on the
bootstrapping procedure. Since these results are very similar to those reported in the body of the
paper, we believe that the basic methodology is well suited to the data being analyzed.

9. The impact of general knowledge stocks on the production of knowledge in
nanotechnology: Empirical results
Table 3 summarizes the results of a Poisson regression with random effects analysis that
indicates the strength of the relationship between three explanatory variables -- the cumulative
stock4 of non-nano articles written by authors affiliated with institutions in a given region, the
cumulative stock of non-nano patents granted to inventors affiliated with institutions in a given
region, and (for purposes of comparison) the cumulative stock of funding dollars awarded by the
National Science Foundation (NSF) to nanotechnology projects initiated by institutions in a
given region5 -- and two dependent variables -- the number of nano articles written in the
corresponding region in a given year, and the number of nano patents granted in the
corresponding region in a given year. There is no standard measure of goodness of fit like the R2
for this procedure, perhaps because it would be controversial to take credit for the explanatory

17

power of the differing regional means. We note that all the coefficients but one in Table 3 are
highly significant and do make comparative evaluations of goodness of fit using Wald (1943)
log-likelihood tests.
From these results in Table 3, we can determine that the rates of production both of nano
articles and of nano patents are higher in regions with a larger cumulative stock of non-nano
articles. However, a larger cumulative stock of non-nano patents has a positive impact only on
the rate of production of nano patents, and not on the rate of production of nano articles. This
finding is consistent with a linear model in which academic discoveries (which dominate the
article counts) add to the research productivity of nearby firms (which dominate the patent
counts), but not vice versa. Adding the NSF nano-funding stock variable very significantly
increases the explanatory power of the regressions relative to the corresponding regressions
without that variable. The same is true for all other regression specifications reported below.
NSF nano-funding significantly increases regional research productivity whether measured by
articles or patents – implying that both universities and firms are more productive in years and
regions with above average support by the NSF. We cannot distinguish from these nonexperimental data the extent to which NSF is independently creating discoveries by its funding
or successfully identifying and facilitating the research efforts of the best and brightest scientists.
This result comes through loud and clear regardless of which model specification we tried. In
Table 3 it also makes the article impact of the cumulative non-nano patent stock significantly
negative. We are tempted to interpret this result as due to more competition for top academic
scientists’ time in areas with very successful firm research efforts, but note that the negative
coefficient is not statistically significant using the alternative bootstrap standard errors reported
in the Appendix.

18

In Table 4, we break down the cumulative stocks by sector. For the dominant players in
article production (universities) and in patent production (firms),6 the strengths of the
relationships between cumulative stocks and annual productivity are similar to those we see in
Table 3. However, the results of the regression for other organizational types display
considerable instability that is difficult to interpret: in research institutes, for example,
cumulative non-nano patent stocks have a strong positive impact on patent production but a
strong negative impact on article production, whereas, in the same sector, cumulative non-nano
article stocks have a negative impact all round. Since the models in Table 3 can be considered to
be nested in the models of Table 4 when the coefficients for the articles knowledge stocks are all
constrained to equal the same number and the coefficients for the patents knowledge stocks are
all constrained to equal the same number (possibly different from the one for articles), we can
use another Wald test (reported at the bottom of Table 4) to see if relaxing the constraints
significantly improves the explanatory power of the regressions. The reported

2

statistics are all

extremely large, demonstrating that the more complicated models of Table 4 have much more
explanatory power than the simple models of Table 3.
We believe that the significant anomalous signs for smaller participants in publishing and
patenting results from multicollinearity among the regressors. While multicollinearity is always
a matter of degree and difficult to assess in nonlinear models like ours, we appear to have a
moderate level of multicollinearity as measured by the variance inflation factor (VIF). When
multicollinearity is a serious problem, the estimated coefficients as well as the standard errors are
unstable and tend to vary widely with a slight change of the observations. With perhaps an
excess of caution, we tried bootstrapping to test the robustness of our results as described in the
Appendix. In general, the bootstrapped standard errors are somewhat larger than those reported

19

in Tables 3-6; some of the coefficients become insignificant, but the main, quantitative
conclusions still hold.

10. The impact of general knowledge flow on the production of knowledge in
nanotechnology: Empirical results
Table 5 displays the results of more Poisson with random effects regressions, this time
run with cumulative counts of cross-institutional-type co-authored non-nano articles in given
regions substituted as an explanatory variable instead of the total counts of non-nano articles.7
Until the Zucker-Darby articles-patent person matching project is completed, we cannot measure
cross-institutional-type collaborations among inventors since their affiliation is available only
from articles.
These results are similar to those displayed in Table 3, with the exception that cumulative
counts of non-nano patents also now have a significant positive impact on the rate of production
of nano articles, even in the presence of the NSF funding variable. When the knowledge flows
are broken down by sector pairings, as in Table 6, the flows between firms and universities,
firms and research institutes, firms and government, and universities and government all show
robustly positive impacts on the rate of production both of articles and of patents. Relaxing the
equality constraint on the coefficients in moving from Table 5 to 6 again very significantly
improves the explanatory power of these regressions.
However, the explanatory power of these regressions is in every case substantially lower
than the corresponding regressions in Tables 3 and 4. Nonetheless, we are encouraged that even
the crude flow variables we are able to measure at this time do as well as they do and are

20

encouraged to pursue this concept in future research when data is available to measure
collaborations for patents as well as articles.

11. Conclusions
In this paper, we have described our investigations of the impact of non-nano knowledge
stocks and knowledge flows on knowledge production in nanotechnology. The research question
that we sought to answer in the course of these investigations was “What factors influence the
rates at which new knowledge is produced in the field of nanotechnology?” We believe that this
question is an important one, not simply because answering it improves our understanding of the
processes by which new knowledge is produced in a rapidly evolving field, but because scientific
knowledge is commonly assumed to be a strong source of economic growth. If we can identify
conditions under which the rate of production of knowledge in a given field is observed to
increase, we may be able to point to firm-, regional-, and national-level strategies and policies
that will encourage the creation of those conditions, and that will ultimately promote economic
growth.
The data analyses reported in this paper provide the following headline results:
(i) that the size of the cumulative knowledge stock of articles published in nonnanotechnological fields in a given geographical region has a significant positive effect on the
rate of production of nanotechnological articles and patents in that region (see Table 3);
(ii) that the size of the cumulative knowledge stock of patents published in nonnanotechnological fields in a given geographical region has a significant positive effect on the
rate of production of nanotechnological patents in that region (see Table 3);

21

(iii) that the volume of the cumulative knowledge flow of cross-institutionally coauthored articles published in non-nanotechnological fields in a given geographical region has a
significant positive effect on the rate of production of nanotechnological articles and patents in
that region (see Table 5); and
(iv) that the size of the cumulative stock of funding dollars awarded by the NSF to
nanotechnology projects initiated by institutions in a given geographical region has a significant
positive effect on the rate of production of nanotechnological articles and patents in that region
(see Tables 3 and 5).
These results allow us to draw two main conclusions. In the first place, the data provide
further support for the general claim that scientific knowledge is strongly cumulative. We
suggest that the Kuhnian critique of the cumulative advantage model (summarized in Section 2)
is valid only under more limited conditions than are examined here. In the second place, the data
supply evidence that ongoing efforts to institutionalize channels for cross-institutional
collaboration are worthy of renewed support at organizational, regional, and national levels.
We mentioned in Section 1 our conviction that knowledge production is deeply
embedded in a network of social structures and practices. Such structures and practices both
constrain action and enable it (see, e.g., Granovetter, 1985). We have found empirically that the
production of nanotechnological knowledge is embedded in the wider social context of
institutional organization, cross-institutional collaboration, and national structures of incentives
and rewards. This embeddedness is constraining, in that the range of possible action is narrowed,
but also enabling, as channels for the flow of tacit knowledge deepen, and the flow between
organizations of different types becomes more differentiated.

22

We predict that a productive seam of future data will be found at the level of the
individual scientist and/or institution, which is the source both of resistance to, and of support
for, nanotechnological knowledge flow. Resistance comes from the large number of scientists
trained in non-nanotechnological areas, who face a daunting choice: either continuing to practice
as they have in the past and risking devaluation in the labor market, or making the effort to
acquire new knowledge and skills, typically at substantial cost. Change comes from a smaller
number of scientists who take the positive decision to learn new areas of science (e.g., biology in
addition to engineering) and/or to move to a new location to improve their access to new
knowledge. Providing a precise specification of the mechanisms by which individual decisionmaking and localized social context together influence the growth of knowledge in particular
fields remains a formidable research challenge.

Appendix
An anonymous referee raised questions about the effect of multicollinearity on our
results. When multicollinearity is a serious problem, the estimated coefficients as well as the
standard errors are unstable and tend to vary widely with a slight change of the observations. As
one approach to seeing whether or not the moderate degree of multicollinearity among our
independent variables was a serious problem, we tried bootstrapping to test the robustness of our
results. Using bootstrap technique, we randomly select the observations with replacement
(clustered by year) 100 times, re-estimate all our models, and calculate the bootstrapped standard
errors. In general, the bootstrapped standard errors in the regressions reported in Tables 3A-6A
are somewhat larger than those reported in the corresponding Tables 3-6, some of the
coefficients become insignificant, but the main, quantitative conclusions still hold.

Nano-relevant awards were identified by searching the NSF “Award Search” website

specialists as indicators of nano-relevance: atomic force microscop*; buckminsterfullerene; c60;
fullerene; giant magnetoresistance; langmuir blodgett; mesoscopic; nanocrystal*; nanoparticle;
nanoscale; nanostructur*; quantum confin*; quantum dot; quantum well; quantum wire; scanning

Notes: 1. Knowledge stocks are computed as a perpetual inventory of the indicated series with 20% per year depreciation
and measured in thousands of cumulated articles or patents.
2. Each variable is measured each year 1981-2004 for each of the U.S. regions which are the 179 functional economic
areas defined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (Johnson and Kort 2004). N = 24 years x 179 regions = 4296.
3. We include in our patent counts only those with an assignee at issue to an organization separate from the inventor(s).
Patents are located by the address of the inventors and classified as to organization type by assignee.
4. The NSF Nano Funding Stock is computed like the knowledge stocks, but measured in millions of US dollars.
5. Knowledge flows are computed as the number of articles co-authored across organization types within one BEA.
