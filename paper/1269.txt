The Medicare trust funds face huge prospective deficits by the end

This paper discusses trends in six areas that bear on the

problem:
care,

labor

the number of the elderly, their health status, use of
force

participation,

income,

and

arrangements.

Among the most important findings are: 1) a very large increase since 1965
in life expectancy at age 65;

2) a very large increase since 1976 in real

per capita health care expenditures on the elderly relative to expenditures
on persons under age 65;

3) a cross-sectional increase with age in per capita

health care expenditures that is primarily attributable to very large expenditures in the last year of life;

4) a sharp decrease in labor force partici-

pation and a sharp increase in relative income of the elderly since 1965.
The paper concludes by raising questions about the need to reconsider the
definition of the elderly, the need for more flexible labor market arrangements
for older workers, and a need for a social consensus concerning appropriate
care of dying patients.

"Though much is taken, much abides."
--Alfred Lord Tennyson

Less than one score years ago this nation brought forth a new
system of financing health care for the elderly--Medicare. This system,
conceived as part of a broad thrust toward a "Great Society" and dedicated
to the proposition that high quality medical care should be freely available
to all persons 65 and over, is now the subject of intense re-examination.
The rapid rate of growth of health care expenditures, the growing
resistance to further increases in governmental taxes or deficits, and
the changing circumstances of the elderly make this an appropriate time
to ask (and attempt to answer) basic questions about the economic and
social forces that affect this age group and this program.

Projections of Medicare outlays and revenues indicate very large

in methods of reimbursement, and discovery of new sources of funds. The other
papers in this volume examine these proposals in detail. This paper attempts
to place the Medicare issue in a broad context by identifying major economic
and social trends that concern the elderly and by briefly considering the
causes and consequences of these trends.

I do not discuss Medicare directly,

2

but the questions. raised and the data presented will, I hope, contribute
to the formulation of improved public policies regarding health care for
the elderly.
I begin by supposing that a policy maker with a strong interest in
the elderly had disappeared in 1950 and had only recently returned. What
would he or she most need to know about the elderly with respect to their
current situation and the changes of recent decades? In my judgment there
are six areas that are of critical importance:

the number of elderly, their

health status, use of medical care, labor force participation, income, and
their

living

arrangements.

I discuss the most dramatic changes in these

areas during the past three decades, indicate how current policies may have
contributed to these changes, and suggest the need for reconsideration of
those

policies.

The Number of Elderly
Almost every article and book about the elderly begins by noting
that the percentage of the population over 65 has grown appreciably over
time.

Why is there so much interest in this percentage? First, it is

assumed that most men and women aged 65 and over are not at work; therefore,
part of the working generation's output must be transferred to the elderly
through

social

security

payments,

of services, or other means.

private

pension

plans,

direct

provision

The higher the percentage of elderly, the

greater the amount that must be transferred. Second, it is assumed that
health deteriorates with age and that the consumption of medical care
increases.

Furthermore, it is argued that even though the decline in

labor income, the deterioration in health, and the increased use

of medical care are, for the most part, foreseeable, many elderly cannot
or do not adequately provide for old age by saving or by acquiring
a health insurance policy when young that would protect them later in life.
(Imperfections

in

insurance

markets,

problems

of

adverse

selection,

and

high administrative and sales costs are said to contribute to this outcome.)
Finally, the rise in the number of elderly increases their political power.
This increase, coming at a time when economic resources are often allocated
through the ballot box rather than the market place, raises the possibility
of bitter political conflict between the elderly and other groups in society.
The definition of old age--that is, the age of eligibility for
retirement

and

Medicare

benefits--is

of viable programs for the elderly.

population in which the birth rate equals the death rate and everyone dies at
80 years of age.

If every man and woman works from ages 20 to 65 and then

retires, the ratio of workers to retirees will be three to one.

If. however,

the retirement age is 70, there will be five workers for every retiree, thus
permitting a substantial increase in benefits or decrease in taxes, or both.
It is conventional to define the elderly with reference to the
number of years since birth, but this is largely a concession to administrative
convenience rather than the logical result of a closely reasoned argument.
Individuals "age" at very different rates and, in theory at least, the elderly
could be defined in terms of years until death, e.g., those men and women
who will die within some specified time.

For instance, we could look at the

proportion of the population that will die within one year (the crude death
rate).

According to this measure the proportion has decreased since 1950.

To be sure, it doesn't make much sense to define infants, children, and

4

young

adults

as

"elderly," even if they are close to death. But a count

of persons 65 and over who will die within the next several years is
informative because much of the interest in the elderly revolves around
their need for medical care and other special services. From a different
perspective, a count of persons 65 and over who are not in the labor force
is revealing because it shows the portion of the population that must live
on transfer payments, income from capital, or dissaving.
These alternative views of who is old yield different trends in
the relative importance of the elderly, as may be seen in Table 1. The
first row shows the familiar increase in the proportion of the population
65 and over, from 8.2 percent in 1950 to 11.3 percent in 1980. The second
row, however, shows that if we define the elderly as persons 65 and over who
will die within five years, this number as a percent of the total population
has increased relatively slowly since 1950 and has hardly grown at all since
1965. Sharp declines in age-specific death rates at ages 65 and above have
offset the effect of the increase shown in the first row.

On the other hand,

if we define the elderly as persons 65 and over who are out of the labor
force (row 3). that proportion has grown even more rapidly than the percent
over 65.

or more or diastolic pressure of 95 or more [NCHS 1981 and 1982a]. Taking
all the available mortality and morbidity data into account, I conclude
that the health status of the elderly at any given age has improved in
recent decades and that this improvement is primarily the result of lowered
incidence or severity of heart disease and cerebrovascular disease.

It is encouraging to note that cancer mortality

has declined for males 35-44; perhaps similar declines will begin to show up
at older ages as the cohorts with fewer cigarette smokers reach that point
in the life cycle.
Will life expectancy at older ages continue to increase at a rapid
rate?

Some experts say 'no," arguing that there is a biologically determined

average limit for the species of about 85 years [Fries 19801. Other observers
contend that recent large declines in the death rate for the 85+ group is
evidence against the existence of that limit [Schneider and Brody 19831.
Both groups agree that additional declines in mortality at ages 65-84 are
possible or even likely; it would, therefore, be prudent to consider the
possibility of such declines in planning future programs for the elderly.

10

Health

Care

Utilization

The role of additional medical care in improving the health of
the elderly is a matter of some dispute.

What is beyond dispute

is the increased consumption of medical services by the elderly. Between
1965 and 1981 there was a large increase in health expenditures at all age
levels, but the share accounted for by persons 65 and over jumped from
23.8 percent to 32.7 percent.

This shift has helped to fan the Medicare

financial crisis; it is, therefore, important to examine it in some detail.
Two factors are responsible and they have been about equal in importance:
first, the number of elderly grew more rapidly than the rest of the population;
second, the change in per capita health expenditures by the elderly outpaced
the rate for persons under 65 (see column 1 of Table 4). The relative
importance of these factors was not the same among the subperiods, however,
as may be seen in columns 2-4.

Not

surprisingly,

per

capita

expenditures

among the elderly rose rapidly in the years immediately after the enactment
of

Medicare

(1965-70).

From 1970 to 1976 per capita expenditures rose at

about the same rate for both age groups; divergent

trends

in

population

accounted for nearly all of the differential change in expenditures.
During 1976-81, however, a large~differential

in population trends, resulted in a total differential change in expenditures
of 3.8 percent per annum.

This was larger than the difference between the

elderly and the rest of the population in the five years immediately
following

the

introduction

of

Medicare!

The last eight rows of Table 4 provide additional detail regarding
the surge of spending on the elderly.

We see that there was a very sharp

deceleration in public spending on persons under 65, while the trend
increased slightly for the elderly. Private spending, on the other hand,
held steady for persons under 65 and accelerated sharply for those over
that age.

With respect to type of expenditure, it was physicians' services

that experienced the most rapid increase among the elderly.
What accounts for these divergent trends? One possibility is that
increasing competition among physicians for patients led more of them to
concentrate on the older men and women in their practice. Another possibility
is that the new medical and surgical interventions have been particularly
applicable

to

older

persons.

in insurance coverage, or in reimbursement methods, or in the number of

in the way physicians treat patients and the way patients use physicians.
Whatever the cause, the upsurge in per capita expenditures of the elderly
is a major factor in the prospective deficits in Medicare.
Does utilization rise with age?

Analysts

interested

in

projecting

future health care utilization by the elderly have frequently noted that
the age distribution within the 65-and-over group is shifting toward the
older ages and that utilization (as reflected by Medicare reimbursements)
rises steadily with age (see first three columns of Table 5). Under the
assumption

that

the

relationship

holds

constant

over time, the effect of the change in age distribution is estimated by

Although this procedure is widely used, implicitly if not explicitly,
it is incorrect.

the

changes that would result from an aging population. Health care spending
among the elderly is not so much a function of time since birth as it is a
function of time to death.

The principal reason why expenditures rise with age

in cross-section (among persons 65and over) isthat the proportion of persons near
death increases with age. Expenditures are particularly large in the last year
of life, and, to a lesser extent, in the next-to-last-year of life. Among
Medicare enrollees in 1976, the average reimbursement for those in their
last year of life was 6.6 times (and in their next-to-last-year of life 2.3
times) as large as for those who survived at least two years [Lubitz and
Prihoda 19821.

As age-specific death rates fall over time, there will be

fewer people in the last year of life in any age category, and this will
tend

that

We

can

estimate

a

"predicted"

expenditure

for each age-sex group by multiplying the proportion in each survival

status

by the all-group average expenditure for each survival status and summing
across the three statuses.

The higher the death rate of the group, the

15

higher would be its "predicted" expenditures. The ratio of actual to
"predicted" expenditures for a group tells us whether expenditures are
relatively high or low after adjusting for its death rate. This ratio
multiplied by the average expenditure for all groups yields the adjusted
expenditure for the gr0up.u
As may be seen in the last three columns of Table 5 and in Figure 1,
adjustment for age-sex differences in survival status eliminates most of

The only reason why older men

use more medical

men are in their last year of life.
I do not claim that there is no effect of aging on health care
utilization apart from the proximity to death, but much of the apparent
effect is attributable to the relationship between age and mortality. This

observation would be of little consequence if mortality rates were constant
over time, but they are not.

Between 1965 and 1978 the age-adjusted death

rate of persons 65 and older fell from 65 per 1,000 to 53 per 1,000.
If age-specific death rates continue to fall at this rate, 75-year-olds
in 1987 will face the same probability of death as 71-year-olds faced in
1965.
How much health care will 75-year-olds

utilize in 1987? The answer

will depend upon many factors, including changes in medical technology,
the strengthening or weakening of family support systems, and revisions in
Medicare

reimbursement

policies.

But to the extent that fewer 75-year-olds

will be in the last or next-to-last year of life, a simple extrapolation
from past utilization of 75-year-olds

is inappropriate.

Kenneth G. Manton [1982] reaches a similar conclusion from a model
that emphasizes the distinction between the hypothetical age trajectory of
mortality risk for individuals and the age trajectory for a cohort.

He writes

"As mortality rates decline at a given age, there would be some compensating
decline in the rate of utilization of certain health services (e.g.. nursing
home care) before that age.

rates are the result of ever more complex technological interventions, the

by older men is so much lower now than it was 30 years ago. As noted, the
health of the elderly has probably improved, and the occupational structure
has shifted away from

blue collar jobs requiring heavy physical exertion.

Thus, at any given age probably fewer men are compelled to leave the labor
force for health reasons now than in earlier decades. Therefore we must
look to other factors.
Mandatory

and

age

discrimination.

According

to

some

popular discussions, men stop working because of mandatory retirement or
because they are victims of age discrimination. In my judgment neither of
these explanations has been a significant factor in the long-term downward
trend

in

labor

force

participation.

First, about half of all currently

retired men were never subject to mandatory retirement rules [Schulz 19761.
Furthermore,,many

workers retire before the mandatory age, many retire

willingly at the mandatory age, and some are not working for other reasons
such as ill health.
Mandatory retirement rules are usually part of a total labor contract,
either explicit or implicit, that provides workers with stable or even rising

If older workers are being paid more than

they're currently worth, when they lose their jobs through mandatory
retirement they obviously have difficulty obtaining a new job at their old
wage rate.
The gap that develops between the wages of some older workers and
their productivity is one reason why we hear complaints about "age
discrimination."

It is obvious that many employers prefer younger to older

1

workers, but this his not "discrimination" in an economic sense if age affects
productivity

or

labor

costs.

For instance, the older worker may expect a

higher wage even though his productivity does not justify the wage differential.

As the share of fringe benefits in the

If.there

appears to be more age discrimination

now than there was 30 years ago, it is probably because of the changes in
wages and fringe benefits that make it less attractive to hire older workers.
Decline

of

self-employment.

One factor that probably does contribute

to the downward trend in participation by older men is the declining
importance

of

self-employment.

Self-employed men are more likely to continue

working at older ages than are wage-and-salary workers, holding constant
education, age, health, wages, and other relevant variables [Fuchs 19821.
Wage-and-salary workers typically face more rigidity in hours and wages,
while the self-employed find it easier to reduce their hours of work without
changing their occupation or job.

Real wages.

Some economists argue that the growth of real wages

in the economy as a whole is a major reason for the decline in iabor force
participation of older men, although this conclusion does not flow directly

21

from

economic

theory.

An increase in participation would be equally

consistent with theory because the higher the wage, the higher the price
of not working.

But higher wages also mean higher income and the income

effect increases the demand for leisure.

It is difficult to predict whether

the price or income effect will dominate.
For women of prime working age higher real wages have resulted in
more

not

less.

In the case of older men, however,

it appears that the income effect is larger than the price effect. This would
explain why the labor force participation of older men has declined in the
United States as real income has risen.

One problem with this explanation

is that participation rates of older men in Europe are as low as in the
United States, even though real income is not as high. To be sure, these
countries typically have generous public pensionplans that facilitate
retirement.

But why do they have such plans? The increasing number of

elderly may be,the

answer, partly because of the political power that

numerical strength confers and partly because younger workers want the older
ones to leave the labor market.

Social

Security.

Probably one of the most important reasons why

the labor force participation of older men has declined so rapidly is the
unusual growth of social security benefits. Between 1970 and 1980 average
retirement benefits (adjusted for inflation) increased by more than 3 percent
per annum, while hourly earnings did not even keep pace with inflation.
There is no doubt that public policy has made it increasingly attractive
for older people to stop work--by increasing retirement benefits relative
to wages, by offering an early retirement option at 62, and by withholding
benefits from eligible retirees at the rate of 50 cents per dollar of earnings
on earnings above a prescribed rate.
The trend toward earlier retirement, combined with greater life
expectancy, will place a tremendous burden on those workers who remain in
the labor force (as noted on page 3).

To reverse this trend, however, wil 1

probably require major changes in the structure of jobs and labor markets
as well as changes in the structure of social security retirement benefits.

Income
From a purely financial perspective, today's older Americans are
much better off than their predecessors.

They have more income and more

wealth (adjusted for inflation) than any previous generation of elderly.
Their real income has risen not only in absolute terms but also relative
to the income of the working population, primarily because of the rapid
growth

of

social

security

retirement

benefits.

It is true that household

income when the householder is 65 or over is only half of that in the
age range 45 to 64, but this figure must be adjusted for household size.

23

In 1980 the households of the elderly had on average only 1.74 persons,
compared with 2.83 persons when the householder is 45-64. Taxes also make
a big difference.

The elderly's taxes (federal and state individual income

taxes, property taxes on owner-occupied housing, and payroll taxes) are
estimated to be only 13 percent of their income, while the 45-64 age group
pay taxes equal to about 25 percent of income [U.S. Bureau of the Census 19831.
Thus the after-tax income per household member of the elderly is almost equal
to that of the 45-64 age group.
Not only does the average older person receive an after-tax income
comparable to that he or she received at younger ages, but income is more

analysis of incomes based on the Retirement History Survey, a longitudinal
study of approximately 11,000 individuals [Hurd and Shoven 19831. In 1968
when the respondents were 58 to 63 years of age and most were still in the
labor force, the wealthiest 10 percent of the sample had a mean income of
$65,363 (all figures in 1982 dollars), while the poorest 10 percent received
only

$1,838.

By 1978, however, at ages 68 to 73, with most of the sample

in retirement, the mean income of the wealthiest 10 percent had fallen to
$52,117 while the poorest 10 percent showed a rise in income to $4,070. The
principal reason for the narrowing of inequality after 65 is that social
security benefits become more important and labor income less important,
and the former is distributed much more equally than the latter.
The improvement in the income position of the peer elderly has been

For instance,, persons

over 65 are more likely to own a house free and clear of any mortgage. Also,
the elderly receive a disproportionate share of non-cash transfers such as
subsidized housing, transportation, and medical care. Because they are

activities

they

fewer

work-related expenses such as commuting and meals away from home, and they
have the opportunity to move to a less costly area of the country.
One disadvantage faced by the elderly is the small size of the
typical

household.

In 1980 44 percent of their households had only one

person, and 46 percent had only two.

Small households are usually not as

efficient as larger ones in the use of space, equipment, food, heat, and
light.

The difficulties and disadvantages of doubling up with another older

person in order to gain the economies of a larger household are, however,
apparently

considerable.

Fewer than 2 percent of elderly households include

members who are unrelated, despite efforts by social agencies to encourage
shared

housing.
Although most of the elderly receive an after-tax income that compares

favorably with what they earned while at work, there is a dramatic change in
the source of income after age 65.

From ages 25 to 54, earnings account for

more than 90 percent of the total, and between 55 and 64 they still account

Does the source of income matter? I think it does. Social security

which the older person can pass on to children or consume at a pace that he

possible for most of the elderly to live with their children even though
only a minority of children have elderly parents living with them. For
example,

if each woman has two daughters, and if half of the women survive

into old age, only one daughter in four would have her mother living with
her, even if every one of the survivors were living with a daughter. As
an indication of how longer life expectancy and falling birth rates have

1981), but the cost of home care is borne mostly by the family through

expenditures

and

of

the

caregiver.

Economic and social factors also affect the location and manner
of death.

According to a report from the National Center for Health

Statistics(l982b), 62 percent of deaths of persons 65 and over occur in
a hospital or medical

center, often at great cost.

In some cases the

patient is hospitalized because there is a reasonable chance to postpone the
death through the kinds of medical intervention that are only possible
within

a

hospital

setting.

In other cases, however, the patient is taken

to the hospital to die because public and private insurance pays more fully
than if the dying person is cared for at home. And in still other cases,
there is no one close enough, either geographically or emotionally, to
offer

any

alternative

to

hospitalization.

The cost of caring for very ill patients can vary enormously,
depending upon the patient and the physician [Garber, Fuchs, Silverman
forthcoming].

In some cases the intensive application of modern technology

can prolong life for one or two months or perhaps even more.

This type of

decision has traditionally been left to the patient and his or her physician,
but exploding costs may lead to a reexamination of that position. At a
minimum, there will be a search for less costly alternatives, and a closer
examination of the factors that influence such decisions.

29

A Final Note
The data presented in this paper and the accompanying discussion are
meant to be suggestive, not definitive.

Large gaps in our understanding of

the aging process and of the determinants of labor force participation,
health care utilization, and other key variables make it difficult to draw
firm

conclusions.

It may be useful, however, to state explicitly some of

the major themes that are implicit in the preceding pages. Most important
is the need to recognize that the "Medicare problem" reflects the intersection
of two larger sets of issues.
the elderly in general:
wages and

First, there are a range of questions concerning

questions

of

retirement

benefits,

age

of

eligibility,

hours of work, and the like. Second, there are questions concerning

the financing, organization, and delivery of health care for persons of all
ages.

Any Medicare "solution" that fails to consider these larger issues

will probably turn out to be counter-productive.
Also implicit in this paper is the need to recognize that resources
devoted to the elderly are resources that could be used to help children,
teenagers, minorities, and other groups with special claims to public attention.
To say this is not to deny that there are many elderly who are poor, sick,
lonely,

or

otherwise

disadvantaged.

But the growing political power of the

.elderly suggests the possibility of disproportionate attention to this group
at a time when many small children are neglected or abused, when the schools
are at a low ebb, and when teenage suicide is at epidemic proportions.
Twenty years ago the plight of the elderly was palpable. Today the most

The "good society" needs to balance

objectives.

30

These considerations, and the data presented in this paper, lead me
to hazard three inferences that have direct relevance for policy. First,
we need to periodically revise our definition of who is old. One way to do
this is to focus on changes in life expectancy at older ages. For instance,
in 1935 when the age of eligibility for social security retirement benefits
was set at 65, life expectancy at that age was 12.5 years.
average

72-year-old

same

life

expectancy.

In 1984 the

From that point of view

it is not unreasonable to say that if 65 marked the entry into old age in 1935,
in 1984 old age begins at 72.
Second, we need to develop more flexible labor market arrangements
to facilitate the continued labor force participation of older men and
women.

Unless this happens, the ratio of workers to retirees will become

so small as to pose a grave threat to our economy and our society. Simply
passing laws against mandatory retirement and age discrimination will not
solve the problem.

We need to develop more flexibility in hours of work,

in wages (to accommodate
and in amou'nt
women

into

possible age-related declines in productivity),

of responsibility (to speed the movement of younger men and

positions

of

leadership

within

organizations).

Finally, and this may Prove to be the most difficult task of all,
we need to reach a social consensus concerning what is appropriate care
for the dying. At present the United States spends about one percent of
the gross national product on health care for elderly persons who are in
their last year of life.

This is much more than the nation spends on

institutional care for the mentally ill and the mentally retarded of all
ages, more than private and public expenditures for basic and applied
research in all fields, and more than the total expenditures of all the

31

private colleges and universities in the country. On the other hand, it
is 1eSS than is spent on alcohol, and not much more than is spent on tobacco.
HOW much should be spent on care for the 1.3 million elderly persons
who die each year? For most goods and services our society answers this
question by saying "Let the market decide." According to economic theory
the free choice of knowledgeable buyers paying with their own money for
services rendered by competitive suppliers should result in a socially
efficient

allocation

of

resources.

It will not necessarily be a "fair"

allocation, but this problem is supposed to be addressed through redistribution
of

income,

This free market approach is not likely to work well for the
seriously

ill.

Patients and their families are often under great emotional

stress and they typically have little previous experience with the complex
technical choices that must be made.

The hospitals and physicians who serve

them often have considerable monopoly power. Furthermore, even in the
