The Behavior of U.S. Short—Term Interest Rates Since October 1979

ABSTRACT

Short-term interest rates in the United States have been "too high" since
October 1979 in the sense that both unconditional and

conditional

forecasts, based

on an estimated vector autoregression model summarizing the prior experience,

short-term interest rates during this period. Although a nonstructural model cannot directly answer the question of why this has been so,
underpredict

comparisons

of alternative conditional forecasts point to the post—October 1979

relationship

between the growth of real income and the growth of real money

balances as closely connected to the level and pattern of short—term interest

rates. This finding is consistent with the authors' earlier conclusion, based
on

analysis of a small structural Inacroeconometric

level

model, that the high average

of interest rates has been due to a combination of slow growth of (nominal)

money supply and continuing price inflation, which together have kept real balances

small in relation to prevailing levels of economic activity.

THE BEHAVIOR OF U.S. SHORT-TERN INTEREST RATES SINCE OCTOBER 1979

Just about

their

all aspects of

interest rates in the United States —

including

overall levels, their movements, and their relationships to one another —

have been extraordinary thus far during the 1980s. Observed nominal interest
rates on most instruments traded in the U.S. debt markets have set record

highs twice since 1980. The amplitude of interest rate swings over the economy's
one—and—a-half business cycles has also been unprecedented in U.S. experience,

and

or

the

shorter-run volatility of interest rates (month-to-month, day-to—day,

even within the trading day) has increased dramatically. The term—structure

"yield curve" was sharply "inverted" during part of this time, although it is no
longer, and other yield comparisons (on taxable versus tax—exempt bonds, for
example) were and have remained far from their historical

norms.

The single aspect of interest rates that has attracted the most attention
during this period has been their persistently high level, including a presumed

high level of "real" interest rates —that is, observed nominal rates less
some presumed expectation of price inflation. During the past few years,
nominal interest rates first rose to levels far above the prevailing inflation
rate, and more recently the decline in nominal interest rates has lagged well
behind the slackening of the pace of inflation.
For two reasons the greatest attention, and also the greatest puzzlement,

have focused on the high level of short-term

interest

rates. First, because

inferring market participants' expectations of inflation is typically more
difficult as the relevant time horizon is longer, the judgment that interest

rates have been unusually

high

in real terms has been much safer for short than

for long maturities. Given the state of and prospects for business activity,
the normal cyclical slowing of inflation since 1980

was

probably widely

—2—

anticipated. By contrast, who is prepared to say what market participants
thought (or think) about the outlook for inflation over the life of a thirty-

year bond?

Second, many of the familiar hypotheses advanced to explain the presund
high real interest rate levels have made sense only for longer maturities.
Fear

that the Federal Reserve System would abandon its anti-inflationary monetary

policy, for example, may have
inflation

affected expectations about the likely rate of

in subsequent years, but not over three-month horizons. Why,

then,

would three-month interest rates have reflected it? The concern that the Reagan
Administration's fiscal policy, combining massive tax cuts with rapidly
increasing

military spending, would require high enough real interest rates to

"crowd out" large amounts of private investment is plausible enough — but only
after the economy had recovered from the 1981-82 recession, which involved the
excess private saving also usually associated with weak economic activity.

This concern would not have affected short-term yields either, at least during

the period to 1983. The idea that increased interest rate and asset price
volatility in the financial markets has led to higher risk premia is quite

plausible too, but it again applies only to 1ongterm instruments, subject to

substantial capital risk. If anything, the effect of greater volatility should
be to increase the demand for short—term instruments, and hence to reduce the i
yields.

Nevertheless,

U.S. short-term interest rates certainly have been high in

the recent past, in both nominal and real terms. From 1953 through the third
quarter of 1979 — a familiar break point in recent analysis of U.S. monetary
policy —the average discount on three-month U.S. Treasury bills was 5.27%.
The subsequent average (to midyear 1983)

real

has been 11.67%. For the corresponding

rate, representing the difference between this nominal rate and the

—3—

annualized percentage change in the gross national product deflator, the analogous

comparison is 1.39% versus 4.71%. During the earlier twenty-six years the
maximum nominal rate observed in any quarter was 9.06% (in 1979:3), while the

maximum real rate was 3.24% (in 1953:4) — in both cases below the corresponding
recent means. Since October 1979, the nominal rate in every quarter but one has
been at least 6% above the corresponding 195 3-79 mean. With few exceptions, the
real rate since then has also consistently been well above the corresponding
1953—79 mean.

In an earlier paper, the authors (1983) used a small structural econometric

model to address two questions: Have U.S. short-term interest rates been "too
high,"

given the relevant historical

relationships connecting interest rates and

other key aspects of macroeconomic activity? nd if so, then why? The basic
strategy employed in that paper was to analyze the errors made in forecasting
short—term interest rates for 1979:4-1983:2, using a model estimated with data
through 1979:3, and to compare them with the analogous errors made for 1976:3-

1979;3 using the same model estimated only with data through 1976:2.1 The

of that

conclusions

October

analysis were that U.S. short—term interest rates since

1979 have indeed been "too high" in a meaningful sense, and that the

familiar story of too little money for the prevailing levels of economic activity
— in particulars the small growth of real balances due to the combination of
slow growth of nominal money
largely

accounts for this phenomenon.

The object
different

supply and sluggish deceleration of price inflation

of this paper is to re-examine the same questions using a

set of empirical tools •

A

structural model like that used in the

authors' earlier paper imposes potentially important restrictions o

the way in

which the estimated model summarizes the relationships exhibited by prior

expeience

—4-

on those restrictions. Restrictions that are ylid reflections of actual
economic

behavior will enable the model to extract the relevant behavioral

relationships more

efficiently from the available data, but incorrect or

arbitrary restrictions will distort the representation of these relationships.

2n

alternative enirical strategy, developed primarily by Sims (1980a, 1980b,

1982), is to forego structural restrictions altogether —that is, apart from
the choice of the variables to be included in the analysis — and instead to
irk with unrestricted dynamic representations of the data.
The exercise

reported in this paper uses a small vector autoregression

representation of the relationships among key macroeconomic variables in the
United States to study the same 1979:4—1983:2 behavior of short-term interest

rates examined in the authors' earlier paper. Here again, the ability to forecast
interest rates during this period, using a model estimated with data ending in

1979:3, sheds light on the question of whether rates have been "too high." To
anticipate, the answer is again yes. Without a structural model, the analysis
cannot directly address the question of why this has been so. Nevertheless,
further experiments based on a conditional forecasting technique suggested by
Doan et al. (1983) indicate results consistent with the authors' earlier finding

that the scarcity of real balances in relation to prevailing levels of economic
activity has been an inportant element in the U.S. interest rate experience since

October 1979. In short, the results of the vector autoregression analysis
reported here correspond well with the main conclusions based on the structural
model.

Section I summarizes the vector autoregression model and presents the

model's (unconditional) forecast of U.S. short—term interest rates during 1979:4-

19832. Section II briefly describes the conditional forecasting technique and
presents results indicating that no single variable — neither money, the
government deficit, nor any of the other variables included in the analysis

—5—

is sufficient to account for the experience of short-term interest rates during
this period.

Sections III and IV present further conditional forecasting

results, including especially those involving the relationship between real

money balances and real economic activity. Section V briefly summarizes the
paper's principal conclusions.

I.

The Vector Autoregressive Model and

Its

Unconditional Projections

The analysis below uses a constant—coefficient, linear vector autoregression

model

to estimate the pre-October 1979 probability structure of

the quarterly

data for six key U.S. macroeconomic variables: the growth rate of the narrowly
defined money stock (Ml), the growth rate of total nonfinancial credit, the change
in the federal budget deficit, the growth rate of real gross national product,

rate of change of the grOss national product deflator, and the change in
the three-month Treasury bill rate. 2 The model can be written as

Given the dynamic correlations among the macroeconomic variables
summarized by the estimated vector autoregression, it is straightforward to
construct a post—October 1979 path that is most likely, in the absence of

further information, for any of the model's variables. In particular, obtaining
the best linear projection of the post-sample values attained by the variables
in each of the fifteen quarters 1979:4-1983:2 simply requires recursively
forecasting one step ahead at a time with the autoregressive equations,

using the successively forecast values of the variables as the data of the system.

Coluinn (1) and (2) of Table II conare this projection for the short—
term interest rate with the corresponding actual values. The forecast fails
to capture any of the variation in short—term interest rates that has attracted

so much attention during this period. The mean error of —.62% — that is, an
underprediction of short—term interest rates on average — results from a larger
underprediction during 1980 and 1981 combined with a substantial overprediction

in late 1982 and 1983. The root-mean-square error is 2.38%.

projected. Nonetheless, money growth was substantially faster (and the interest
rate lower) than projected for the more recent quarters 1982:4—1983:2. For the
eight quarters immediately following October 1979, both income growth and
inflation were roughly as projected by the model.

II. Conditional Forecasting with the Vector Autoregression Model

knowledge of (linear combinations of) other elements of z in all post-October
1979 quarters through the end of the forecast period. Recent work by Sims (1982)
and

Doan

et al. (1983) has introduced and successfully

of

employed such conditional

to evaluate the plausibility of macroeconometric forecasts in light

the historical dynamic correlations among the variables being predicted.
The basis for constructing these constrained projections is the method of

Kalman filtering. Clarida and Coyle (1983) have shown that Kalman filtering may

be

applied to any state space model which. combines post—sample observations on a

linear combination of a system's variables with that system's historically
estimated parameters to yield minimum mean—square linear estimates which
optimally incorporate the post-'sample observations. They have also established
a particularly simple relationship between the unconditional projection of z
in the s'th post-sample quarter, say,

and the projection Iwhich

incorporates a vector of post-sample observations, , on linear combinations of
the elements of z:

l=

+ K(-?).

In words, the difference between the ôonditional and unconditional projection

for z is then just a linear transformation of the difference between the
observed vector

and its best linear projection .

The

associated transformation

matrix K can

be

computed directly, and at reasonable cost, from the parameter

and variance—covariance matrices of the estimated vector autoregression.
Columns (3)-(7) of Table II show the results of using the model described

in Section I to generate successive dynamic forecasts of U.S. short—term interest
rates that are each conditional on one variable among the five (other than the

interest rate itself) included in the vector autoregression system. For each
successive conditioning variable, the relevant column reports the fifteen
quarter-by—quarter forecast values, together with the same summary

statistics

shown in column (2) for the unconditional forecast.

What is immediately striking in this set of results is that, with the
single exception of the forecast conditional on the price variable, none of
these conditional

discussed

the

forecasts represents an

improvement over the unconditional

in Section I. The forecast conditional on money growth is by

worst among the five, as the model not only fails tQ capture much of

the movement to unusually high short-term interest rates in 1980 and 1981 but
also incorrectly infers that the speed-up of money growth in 1982 and early

1983 would have led rates to drop to levels last seen in the l950s. Both

the

root—mean—square error and the mean absolute error are much larger than those of

the

unconditional forecast. The forecast conditional on credit growth is

roughly

similar overall, although less extremely off track than that conditional

on money growth. At least in this context, knowing either money growth (only)

or credit growth (only) would have been less useful than knowing nothing at all.
The forecast

conditional on the deficit change captures the high average

interest rate level in 1980 and 1981 with fair accuracy — except for

the immediate post-credit-controls (and post-recession) dip in 1980:3, of.

course — but it fails to capture the sharp drop in rates that occurred once the
stance of monetary policy shifted in late 1982. As a result, this forecast

—9--

overpredicts short—term interest rates on average during 1979 :3—1983 :2, in

contrast

to the average underprediction made by the unconditional forecast

or the forecast conditional on either money or credit growth. The mean error
here is somewhat smaller (in absolute value) than that of the unconditional
forecast, but the root—mean-square error is larger.

Although the summary statistics for the forecast conditional on real
income growth and that conditional on the deficit change are almost identical,
the quarter-by—quarter forecast values show large dissimilarities.

conditional

The forecast

on real growth underpredicts short—term interest rates on average in

1980 and 1981, but then entirely misses the sharp drop that accompanied the end
of the 1981-82 recession and the beginning of the business recovery. The overall
result is again overprediction (by the smallest mean absolute error among the
five

forecasts

considered here), and again a root-mean-square error even larger

than that of the unconditional forecast.
The

forecast

conditional on price inflation is the only one among the five

to improve unambiguously on the unconditional forecast. The quarter-by—quarter

pattern of this forecast is similar to that of the forecast conditional on the
deficit change. The forecast conditional on inflation also captures reasonably
well the high average level of short-term interest rates in 1980 and 1981 (again,
except

for 1980:3), and it also fails to capture the drop in rates at the end

of 1982. Its mean overprediction is somewhat larger than that of the forecast
conditional on the deficit change (it is almost as large as the mean absolute
error of the unconditional forecast), but the associated root-mean—square error
is

smaller than that of any of the other forecasts considered thus far.
On the whole, these dynamic interest rate forecasts conditional on single

other

variables are not encouraging, They suggest that (with the limited possible

exception of inflation) no one macroeconomic variable can tell much of the story

—10—

of

why short-term interest rates moved as they did during this period.

III. Richer Conditional Forecasts: The Role of Real Balances
As the discussion in Section II explains, the conditional forecasting
technique suggested by Doan et al. facilitates using an estimated vector
autoregression model not only to generate forecasts conditional on one single

variable but also forecasts conditional on several variables or on the sums or
differences (more generally, any linear combination) of several variables.
In light of the limited success of the short—term interest rate forecasts

conditional only on single variables, it is worthwhile to experiment with forecasts

conditional on richer information sets. Even so, simply trying in succession all
possible combinations among the five other variables included in the vector

autoregression hardly makes sense. The approach taken here is instead to
focus on a few specific combinations suggested by the authors' previous work,

based on a structural model, which concluded that the high level of U.S. shortterm interest rates since October 1979 has principally reflected the relationship
between real money balances and real economic activity.
Column (3) of Table II already indicates the limited value, from the

perspective of the vector autoregression's forecast of short-term interest
rates during this period, of the information contained in the growth rate of real

incon. Column (8) shows a similar result for the growth rate of real money
balances, represented in the model

by the difference between the (nominal) money

growth rate variable and the price inflation variable. The forecast conditional
on real money growth underpredicts short—term interest rates, although with a

small mean absolute error. Its root—mean—square error, however, is larger than
that of the unconditional forecast, In short, neither real income growth nor real
money growth (and certainly not nominal money growth) successfully helps the model

—11—

to

predict short-term interest rates during this period.
By contrast, the two together do just

of

that.

Column (9)

shows the results

of short—term interest rates conditional on both real income growth
and real money growth. This forecast underpredicts part of the high average

interest

rate level in

1980 and 1981,

and

it

does not adequately capture the

decline in late 1982. On balance it underpredicts short-term interest rates, with
a mean absolute error less than half that of the unconditional forecast. More

the root—mean-square error is substantially smaller than that of the
unconditional forecast (and also smaller than that of the forecast conditional
importantly,

on the inflation rate).
This

result, like any finding based on a non-structural model, cannot by

itself lead to any conclusions about what has "causedt' the high interest rate
levels prevailing in the United States since October 1979. It simply relates
interest rates to specific macroeconomic variables — in particular, real balances
and real income

and not to elements of macroeconomic behavior like money demand

and money supply. Nevertheless, the apparent value in this context of the
information contained jointly in real money growth and real income growth is

consistent with the authors' earlier explanation (based on a structural model)
that the slow growth of nominal money supply and the continuing rapid price

inflation combined to render the supply of real money balances small in comparison
with

the real money demand associated with the prevailing levels of real activity..4

To put the point the other way around, the. alternative finding

Given this result, it is interesting to determine whether the information

—12—

that matters for the model's forecast of short—term interest rates involves
real income growth and real money growth separately, or only their difference

—that is, the growth of velocity. An analogous forecast conditional on
velocity growth (not shown in the table) results in a mean error of .37% and a
root—mean—square error of 2.09%, inferior to the forecast conditional on real
income growth and real money growth separately, but superior to any of the

other forecasts considered.5 In other words, imposing the restriction
represented by combining real income growth. and real money growth into velocity

growth causes a loss of some, but far from all, of the relevant information
contained in these two variables.

in these variables improves the model's short—term interest rate forecast in
comparison to the corresponding unconditional forecast, in comparison to forecasts

—1 3—

conditional on single variables (including real income growth or real money

growth separately), and in comparison to forecasts conditional on other
combinations of variables.

IV. Forecasts Conditional on the Full Information Set
The results

presented

in Sections II and III focus on projections of the

most likely post.-October 1979 path for U.S. short-term interest rates which
incorporate

information about various other aspects of the contemporaneous

macroeconomic experience. The results indicate that the unprecedented behavior

of short—term rates throughout this period is consistent with some features of
the recent macroeconomic experience (for exanle, the relationship between real

balances and real income), but not with others (for example, the respective
paths
of

of money and

the

deficit). Column (10) of Table II shows the projection

the most likely recent short-term interest rate path which simultaneously

incorporates information on the post-October 1979 behavior of all five of the
system's other variables: money growth,

credit growth, real income growth, price

inflation, and the deficit change.
Given

the recent behavior and historical correlations among all of these

key macroeconomic variables,

the resulting projection substantially and

consistently underpredicts short-term interest rates throughout the period since
October 1979. The mean error is -2.74%, with underpredctions in eleven of the

fifteen quarters, (The only exceptions are 1980:3 and 1982:4-l983;2 episodes

highlighted above.) This "fully informed" projection does forecast short-

term

interest rates

with

a forecast mean of 8.92% versus comparable averages of 6.12% during the

l970s

that are quite high in relation to historical experience,

and 3.45% from the end of the Korean War through the l96Os. Nevertheless,

the iulications of the "fully inorined" projection exercise is clear. The

-14-

behavior of short—term interest rates since October 1979 does not appear to be
consistent with the relevant historical correlations and the recent macroeconomic
experience.

V. Summary of Conclusions
Two questions motivated the analysis in this paper: Have U.S. shortterm interest rates been "too high," given the relevant historical relationships

connecting interest rates and other key aspects of macroeconomic activity? And
if so, then why?
The

analysis here gives a yes answer to the first question. An estimated

model summarizing the prior experience predicts that short-term interest rates
would be

high on average after October 1979, but not so high as the average

level actually obtained. The model's unconditional forecast underpredicts
interest rates in the post—October 1979 period, and so does the corresponding
forecast conditional on all five

of

the other variables included.

A non—structural model cannot directly answer the second question, but
comparisons among the conditional forecasting exercises reported here point to the

post-October 1979 relationship between the growth of real income and the growth
of

real money balances as closely connected to the pattern of short—term interest

rates during this period. This finding is consistent with the authors' earlier
conclusion,

that

based on

analysis of a small structural macroeconometric model,

the high average level of

slow growth of

interest rates has been due to a combination of

(nominal) money supply and continuing price inflation, which

together have kept real balances small in relation to prevailing levels of real
economic activity.

1. The cut-off at 1976 :2 represented the end of the sample used in the original
presentation of the model in Friedman (1977).

2. The interest rate data are averages of daily observations for the first month
of each quarter. The inflation data are contemporaneous with the interest

rate data. Alternative ways of constructing the data —

for

example,

aligning the interest rate and price change series differently or using

quarterly average interest rate observations — apparently make little
difference for the results reported here.

3. The "Granger causality from interest rates to output has been documented by
Sims (1980b). "Granger causality" from credit to output is consistent with
the findings of Friedman (1983).

4. The same story
although

the

can

be told in either real or nominal terms, of course,

real version is presumably preferable unless the income

elasticity of the demand for money is identical to the price elasticity. A
forecast analogous to that reported in column (9), but conditional or

nominal money and nominal income, results in mean error 1.19% and root—mean—
square error 2,01%.

5. The root—mean—square error matches that of the forecast conditional on price
inflation, but the mean error is smaller.
