International Reserves Management and the Current Account
Joshua Aizenman
NBER Working Paper No. 12734
December 2006
JEL No. F15,F32,F36,F4
ABSTRACT
The paper assesses the costs and benefits of active international reserve management (IRM), shedding
light on the question of how intense should IRM be for an emerging market. In principle, an active
IRM strategy could lower real exchange rate volatility induced by terms of trade shocks; provide self
insurance against sudden stops; reduce the speed of adjustment of the current account; and even allow
for higher growth if it fosters exports ("mercantilist" motive). The message of the report is mixed -management of reserves is not a panacea. The mercantilist case for hoarding international reserves,
as an ingredient of an export led growth strategy, is dubious. Done properly, IRM augments macro
economic management in turbulent times, mitigating the impact of external adverse shocks and allowing
for a smoother current account adjustment. These benefits are especially important for commodity
exporting countries, and countries with limited financial development.

“Several factors, apart from the exchange rate regime, influence the comfort level in regard
to reserves. Illustratively, they would include vulnerability to the real sector shocks,
strength of the fiscal and financial sectors, current account balance, the changing
composition of capital flows, a medium-term view of growth prospects encompassing
business cycles, etc. In a sense, official reserves have to reflect the balancing and
comforting factors relative to external assets and liabilities in the context of a rational
balance sheet approach.”

“…following the Asian crisis of the late 1990s it was likely that countries might choose
to build up large foreign exchange reserves in order to be able to act as a “do it yourself”
lender of last resort in US dollars.”

This paper assesses the costs and benefits of active international reserve
management (IRM). The first part outlines and appraises various channels where IRM
may enhance economic performance, focusing on two important channels: i) IRM lowers
real exchange rate volatility induced by terms of trade shocks; ii) IRM provides self
insurance against sudden stops and fiscal shocks, reducing the downside risk associated
with adverse shocks. There is weaker evidence regarding other channels, including iii) A
mercantilist motive, where IRM is alleged to lead to higher growth induced by fostering
export; and iv) A greater capacity to smooth overtime adjustment to shocks, thereby
reducing the speed of adjustment of the current account.
Our analysis of international reserve management supplements the insights of
earlier literature, which focused on using international reserves as a buffer stock, as part
of the management of an adjustable-peg or managed-floating exchange-rate regime.1
While valid, the buffer stock approach fitted better a world with limited financial
integration, where trade openness determined countries’ vulnerabilities to external
1

Accordingly, optimal reserves balance the macroeconomic adjustment costs incurred in
the absence of reserves with the opportunity cost of holding reserves (see Frenkel and
Jovanovic, 1981). The buffer stock model predicts that average reserves depend
negatively on adjustment costs, on the opportunity cost of reserves, and on exchange rate
flexibility; and positively on GDP and on reserve volatility driven frequently by the
underlying volatility of international trade. Overall, the literature of the 1980s supported
these predictions; see Frenkel (1983), Edwards (1983), and Flood and Marion (2002) for
a recent review.

shocks. In the absence of reserves, balance of payments deficits would have to be
corrected via a reduction in aggregate expenditures, imposing adjustment costs. As
greater trade openness increases the exposure to trade shocks, minimizing adjustment
costs requires higher reserve holdings. The rapid financial integration of developing
countries, and the financial crises of the 1990s focused attention on the growing exposure
to sudden stops and on reversals in flows of capital.2 In such a world, financial markets
may force an adjustment well before flows of commercial trade would adjust, shifting the
focus to exposure to financial shocks, and to costs associated with disintermediations
triggered by adverse liquidity shocks.
Section 1 evaluates empirically the impact of international reserves on real
exchange rate volatility in the presence of terms of trade shocks. The evidence suggests
that international reserves play a role in the mitigation of terms of trade (TOT) shocks in
Developing countries, but not in the OECD. Economic structure matters greatly – exports
of natural resources double both the impact of terms of trade shocks on the real exchange
rate, and that of the mitigation associated with IRM on the real exchange rate. These
results are consistent with the notion that the limited development of capital markets in
developing countries hampers their ability to mitigate the volatility associated with
shocks. Section 2 models such a mechanism, explaining possible effects of IRM in the
presence of costly financial intermediation of long term investment. Section 3 overviews
the debate about international reserves management and mercantilist motives, outlining
the empirical and the theoretical limitations of the mercantilist approach. The
mercantilist case for hoarding international reserves, as an ingredient of an export led
growth strategy, is lacking empirical evidence. In addition, hoarding international
reserves motivated by short-run competitiveness concerns of one country may trigger
other countries into adopting a similar policy, to preempt any competitive advantage
gained by the first country. These circumstances may lead to competitive hoarding of
reserves, which in turn would dissipate any competitiveness gains. Section 4 evaluates
the impact of international reserves on current account persistence. The results support
the notion that a higher build up of reserves allows countries to be better buffered against

shocks, thereby reducing the speed of adjustment of the current account. This outcome is
consistent with the importance of current account adjustments in allowing for smoother
consumption, in the presence of limited financial integration and sudden stops. Section 5
concludes with a discussion of the limitations of international reserves management.

1. Real exchange rate volatility, terms of trade and international reserves.
In this section we focus on some of the challenges facing a developing country
with limited development of its internal capital market, a growing integration with the
global financial system, and a large exposure of the current account to terms of trade
effects. This description applies especially to commodity exporting countries, subject to
large terms of trade shocks. While favorable terms of trade shocks tend to induce real
appreciation and capital inflows, the downturns associated with adverse shocks impose
daunting challenges. To put this topic in a broader context, note that the literature of the
1990s identified large adverse effects of exogenous volatility on the GDP and on
economic growth in developing countries.3 Fundamentally, this issue hinges on the
nature of non-linearties affecting the economy, where strong enough concavity may
generate first order adverse effects of volatility on the GDP and on growth. An important
channel that may explain such negative level and growth effects of volatility are
imperfect capital markets.
A recent contribution illustrating these considerations is Aghion, Bacchetta,
Ranciere and Rogoff (2006), who found that real exchange rate volatility reduces growth
for countries with relatively low levels of financial development. These studies suggest
that factors mitigating real exchange rate volatility may be associated with superior
economic performance. The large hoarding of international reserves by developing
countries in recent years raises the question to what extent have these reserves affected
the volatility of the REER. For most countries, terms of trade shocks are the most
important source of exogenous volatility, frequently leading to real exchange rate

3

See Ramey and Ramey (1995) and the references in Aizenman and Pinto for the
association between macro volatility and growth. See IDB (1995) and Calderón and
Schmidt-Hebbel (2003) for the impact of terms of trade shocks and of other foreign
shocks on growth in Latin America and in developing countries.

volatility, potentially magnifying business cycle volatility. This issue is pertinent for
developing countries, as they are exposed to TOT volatility, the standard deviation of
which is 3 times the volatility of industrial countries. Shallow domestic financial systems
of relatively small size, and the lack of sectoral diversification in most developing
countries limit their ability to mitigate TOT shocks by internal adjustment. Sovereign
risk and the lack of proper financial instruments inhibit the ability to hedge against these
shocks by relying on the global financial system [see Caballero (2003) and Caballero and
Panageas (2003)]. Developing countries may be left with self insurance as a last resort
option for dealing with TOT shocks.
In Aizenman and Riera-Crichton (2006) we confirm this possibility. We start by
applying a rudimentary panel regression methodology, and show that the main result is
robust to adding controls and to a more sophisticated estimation method. Specifically,
the benchmark regression is

(1)

ln( REERit ) = a1,i + α1 (TO *ln(TOT ))it + α 2 (TO *ln(TOT ) * RES )it + ε it

where the independent variable is the log of the real effective exchange rate (REER),
defined so that a higher REER indicates real appreciation. The term a1,i represents
country fixed effects, TOT is the terms of trade, TO = ln[1 + (

openness measure, and RES = ln[1 +

(1) implies that the elasticity of the real exchange rate with respect to effective terms of
trade change is4

(2)

∂ ln( REER)
= α1 + α 2 * RES
TO * ∂ ln(TOT )

Hence, regression (1) provides information about the degree to which hoarding
international reserves may impact REER dynamics induced by terms of trade shocks.
Table 1 reports the regression results for 1970-2004. Column (1) presents the baseline
regression pooling all countries, subject to data availability. The elasticity of the REER
with respect to the effective terms of trade shock is well above one: a one percent
improvement of the effective terms of trade induces a REER appreciation of about 1.8
percent. International reserves hoarding lessens the elasticity of the REER with respect to
the TOT by more than twice the International reserves/GDP (i.e., column (1) implies that

∂ ln( REER) /[TO * ∂ ln(TOT )] ≅ 1.8[1 − 2* RES ] ).
Equation (2) is the elasticity of the REER with respect to the effective TOT,

implying that the elasticity of the REER exchange rate with respect to the TOT is
∂ ln( REER) / ∂ ln(TOT ) = TO * [α 1 − α 2 * RES ] ≅ TO * 1.8[1 − 2 * RES ] . Hence, for a

country with trade openness of 0.25, and IR/GDP ratio of 0.1, the elasticity of the REER
with respect to the TOT is .25*1.8(1-2*0.1) = 0.36, in line with De Gregorio and Wolf
(1994), who found that the elasticity of the REER with respect to TOT, unconditional of
the RES position, is about 0.4.
Aggregation matters -- columns (2) and (3) show that this result applies to
developing, but not to Industrial countries. This is consistent with the notion that limited
development of the capital market in developing countries hampers their ability to
mitigate the volatility associated with shocks. Economic structure matters greatly –
exports of natural resources magnify the impact of the effective terms of trade shocks and
the mitigation associated with international reserves by a factor exceeding 2.
Interestingly, the international reserve effect is insignificant for that group, yet we will

Throughout our discussion we presume that trade openness and International
reserves/GDP are characterized by low volatility relative to TOT volatility.

show later that it’s significant for the lagged TOT shock. In contrast, these interactions
are insignificant for manufacturing intense countries. The last two columns focus
specifically on Latin America and Asia; TOT shocks induce large effects in both blocks.
International reserves induce a powerful mitigation of the TOT shock in Asian countries,
but not in LATAM.
Table 2 verifies the robustness of prior results, redoing the base regression of the
case where we evaluate the adjustment to the one year lagged terms of trade shock on the
contemporaneous REER:5

(1’)

ln( REERit ) = a1,i + α1 (TO *ln(TOT ))it −1 + α 2 (TO *ln(TOT ) * RES )it −1 + ε it

The signs are identical to Table 1, the main difference being that shocks are
apparently absorbed faster in LATAM and Asia, where most of the coefficients on the
lagged shocks are insignificant for these blocks.
Table 3 reports country specific results for several Latin American countries. The
last two columns of the Individual country table represent the total effect of terms of trade
changes (amplified by trade openness) into the real exchange rate; taking into account the
mitigation offered by international reserves:

= [α1 + (α 2 * RES 2000−04 ) ]
∂[TO *ln(TOT )]
Total Effect 1990-99 =

Overall, the results suggest that reserves play a role in the mitigation of TOT shocks only
in Developing countries. While this role widely differ across countries, the mitigation
role of international reserves is important, especially in countries abundant with natural
resources, like Argentina, Chile, Ecuador and Mexico.

We rejected the unit root hypothesis for the REER. We applied a Levin-Lin-Chu panel
unit root test. The test assumes that each individual unit in the panel shares the same
AR(1) coefficient, but allows for individual effects, time effects and possibly a time
trend. We found high persistence: the autoregressive coefficient of about 0.84, but well
below 1.

7
The results reported above focus on the association between the level of the terms
of trade, International reserves/GDP and the real exchange rate. We also verified that a
higher International reserves/GDP is associated with a lower REER volatility. This
result is consistent with Hviding, Nowak and Ricci (2004), who focused on the
association of International reserves/GDP and the volatility of the real exchange rate,
controlling for exchange rate regimes. Aizenman and Riera-Crichton (2006) also
confirmed that the mitigation effects identified in (2) continue to hold when we control
for exchange rate regimes, and for the composition of capital flows [see Broda and Tille
(2003) for the role of exchange rate flexibility in accommodating the adjustment to terms
of trade shocks].
Appendix A outlines a case study of Chile. Applying OLS and a VAR analysis,
we find that an improvement in Chile’s terms of trade is associated with a drop of the
lending and deposit rates, and an improvement of Chile’s external risk evaluation. We
turn now to an elaborate model of costly financial intermediation, explaining possible self
insurance aspects of ex-ante hoarding of international reserves.

2. The model -- financial intermediation, self insurance and the real exchange rate

A growing literature has identified financial intermediation, in the presence of
collateral constraints, as a mechanism explaining the hazard associated with credit cycles
induces by shocks. The prominent role of bank financing in developing countries
suggests that capital flights, induced by adverse terms of trade shocks or contagion,
impose adverse liquidity shocks. This section outlines a model describing conditions
under which ex-ante hoarding of international reserves may provide a self insurance
mechanism that would mitigate the real effects of liquidity shocks, ultimately reducing
the adverse effects of terms of trade volatility on the GDP. For simplicity, we focus on an
ex-ante/ex post model dealing with the determination of the GDP level and the real
exchange rate during one investment cycle. Applying the logic of endogenous growth,
one may extend the model to deal with the impact of terms of trade shocks on growth.
As our focus is on developing countries, we assume that all financial
intermediation is done by banks, relying on debt contracts. Specifically, we consider the

8
case where investment in a long-term project should be undertaken prior to the realization
of liquidity shocks. Hence, shocks may force costly liquidation of earlier investments,
thereby reducing output. We solve the optimal demand for deposits and international
reserves by a bank that finances investment in long-term projects. The bank’s financing is
done using callable deposits, exposing the bank to liquidity risk. Macro liquidity shocks,
stemming from sudden stops and capital flights, cannot be diversified away. In these
circumstances, hoarding reserves saves liquidation costs, potentially leading to large
welfare gains; gains that hold even if all agents are risk neutral. In this framework,
deposits and reserves tend to be complements – higher volatility of liquidity shocks will
increase both the demand for reserves and deposits. This is another example of hoarding
international reserves as a self-insurance against non-diversifiable liquidity shocks.6
We model the financial intermediation and the real exchange rate by combining
Diamond and Dybvig’s (1995) insight with Aghion, Bacchetta and Banerjee’s (2003)
modeling of market imperfections in a collateral dependent small open economy.7 We
construct a minimal model to explain the self insurance offered by international reserves,
in mitigating the output effects of liquidity shocks with endogenous real exchange rate
determination. Investment in a long term project should be undertaken prior to the
realization of liquidity shocks. Hence, the liquidity shock may force costly liquidation of
the earlier investment, reducing second period output. We simplify further by assuming
that there is no separation between the bank and the entrepreneur – the entrepreneur is the
bank owner, using it to finance the investment.
We consider a small open economy, where a traded good is produced with capital
and a country specific non-traded factor. In addition, the traded sector includes exports of
commodities, generating revenue which is determined by the realization of terms of trade
shocks [= the relative price of the exported commodities to other traded goods]. The
traded good is the numeraire. The relative price of the non-traded factor is denoted by p,

(2004), Aizenman and Lee (2005), Jeanne and Ranciere (2005), and Rodrik (2006) for
studies dealing with various aspects of self insurance and international reserves.

and is referred to as the real exchange rate There is a continuum of lenders and
borrowers and their number is normalized to 1.
We focus now of the evolution of the economy throughout one investment cycle,
where gestation lags imply that capital should be installed well before hiring specific nontraded input. To simplify, the supply of the specific factor is inelastic, at a level Z. The
lenders in the economy cannot invest directly, but lend their saving at the international
interest rate. Depositors are entitled to a real return of rf on the loan that remains
deposited for the duration of investment. The safe return reflects a risk free investment
opportunity, either in the form of a foreign bond, or as storage technology. The
borrowers are entrepreneurs who have investment opportunity, but are credit constrained.
The actual investment should be undertaken prior to the realization of liquidity shocks.

where K1 is the non-liquidated capital invested at period 1, z is the level of countryspecific input, hired at a relative price of p1 . Premature liquidation of capital is costly,
and is associated with a proportionate adjustment cost of θ . Specifically, reducing the
capital stock by one dollar yields a net liquidity of 1 /(1 + θ ) .
The time line associated with financial intermediation is summarized in Figure 1.
At the beginning of period 1, the entrepreneur with initial wealth H 1 , borrows μH 1 .8 The

(1 + μ )H1 = K1 + R1 .

Collateral constraints can be shown to arise due to capital market imperfections in the
presence of moral hazard and costly monitoring [see Holmstrom and Tirole (1996) and
Aghion, Banerjee and Piketty (1999)].

10
Next, a liquidity shock δ realizes. A positive shock is inconsequential, because
banks can accommodate positive liquidity shocks by purchasing a risk free bond, or
investing in the risk free low yield storage technology. Hence, we focus our attention on
adverse liquidity shocks, reducing desirable deposits form μH 1 to μH 1 (1 + lδ ) ,

δ < 0, l > 0. Our model focuses on the impact of adverse liquidity shocks on optimal
investment and liquidity, refraining from modeling the reasons for the shock. Such a
shock may reflect external developments, like a higher foreign interest rate, contagion, or
a reaction to a signal revealing the future TOT. For example, suppose that the public
learns of a signal δ , determining the second period foreign currency earnings from
commodity exports. A negative TOT shock may induce anticipation of an economic
slowdown, triggering capital flights, and reducing deposits from μH1 to μ H1 (1 + lδ ) .
Independently of the exact source of the adverse liquidity shock, gestation lags associated
with tangible investment and costly liquidation, expose the bank to the downside risk
associated with abrupt adjustment.
The bank uses reserves to meet the liquid shock and to purchase the non-traded
input. In case of need, the liquidly shock may be met by costly liquidation of capital.
Consequently, the ultimate capital is:

To gain further insight, it is useful to focus on the simplest discrete example,
where with probability half an adverse liquidity shock of δ = −ε ( 0 ≤ ε < 1 ) would take
place, and with probability half there would be no liquidity interruption. The value of ε
corresponds to the volatility of the liquidity shock, δ. The asymmetric nature of tangible
investment implies that only negative liquidity shocks may require real adjustment. In
these circumstances, the expected profits are:

(12)

Hence, small enough leverage and a large enough adjustment cost implies ε~ > 1 -- the
liquidation option would not be exercised. In these circumstances, the optimal
investment and the ex-ante hoarding of international reserves are:
K1 = β (1 + μ ) H1 − 0.5β lεμ H1 ;

If ε~ < 1 , the partial liquidation option would be exercised in bad times only if the
volatility exceeds the threshold, ε~ < ε < 1 . For volatility below the threshold,

ε < ε~ < 1 , no liquidation would take place, and the equilibrium is characterized by
(13)-(14).

13
Proof:

- The characterization of the planned investment and of the ex-ante hoarding of reserves,
(13), follows by solving K1 from (10a).
- The optimal stock of capital following partial liquidation, (11), is obtained by
maximizing the profits in bad times with respect to K 1 [the second line of (8)], noting
that K 1 has been preset at the beginning of the planning horizon.
- The volatility threshold inducing liquidation in bad times, ε~ , is obtained by noting that
at ε = ε~ , K = K -- at the lowest volatility associated with liquidation in bad times,

the liquidation is zero. Solving (11) for the case where K 1 = K 1 , we infer

Discussion:

- Smaller leverage and larger adjustment costs imply a higher threshold of volatility
associated with liquidation [see (12)]. In the no-liquidation range (ε > ε~ ) , (13) implies
that investment drops by half of the anticipated liquidity shock. This drop is financing an
equal increase in ex-ante hoarding of international reserves. This hoarding will mitigate
the effects of adverse liquidity shocks in bad times. The adverse liquidity shock would
induce a real depreciation of

εβ l μ H1
Z

(see 14). The extra liquidity induced by hoarding

reserves, and the real deprecation in bad times allow the economy to adjust fully without
the need to liquidate tangible capital. Yet, this comes at the cost of a drop in planned
investment and output.
- If ε~ < 1 , we have a mixed regime: for large enough volatility above the threshold, the

regime is characterized by a partial liquidation of capital in bad times. For volatility
below the threshold, the liquidation option would not be exercised. Hence, high enough
volatility induces a regime switch from the non liquidation to the partial liquidation of
capital.

14
An example of the two regimes is provided in Figure 2, tracing the optimal
planned investment K1 as a function of volatility. Recalling that R1 = (1 + μ ) H1 − K1 , the
patterns of reserves as a function of volatility, are the mirror image of the patterns of the
planned investment: dR1 / d ε = − dK1 / d ε . Panel A (B) corresponds to a relatively high
(low) adjustment cost, θ = 0.2 (θ = 0.02). For relatively low volatility, liquidation would
not be exercised, and higher volatility would reduce the planned investment, increasing
the level of reserves. These reserves will be used to meet adverse liquidity shocks, saving
the need to engage in a costly ex-post liquidation of productive investment. High enough
volatility implies that the liquidation option would supplement the defensive hoarding of
reserves. Note that liquidation mitigates the adverse impact of higher volatility on the
planned investment, as can be seen by comparing the slopes of the two lines below and
above the volatility threshold, ε~ . This mitigation, however, comes at a deadweight loss
associated with adjustment costs.
Interestingly, at the regime switch to the partial liquidation regime, we observe a
discrete drop of the planned investment, and a matching discrete jump in the ex-ante
hoarding of reserves. This follows from the observation that the switch to the partial
liquidation regime increases the marginal valuation of liquid reserves. The intuition for
this is straightforward – in the partial liquidation regime, an extra unit of liquid reserves
saves the need to liquidate 1 + θ capital, saving the deadweight loss of θ . This marginal
benefit of liquidity is absent in the ‘no liquidation’ regime. Consequently, at the regime
switch, there is discontinuity where the ex-ante demand for liquidity jumps, inducing a
drop in planned investment. This drop increases with the adjustment costs, as is vividly
illustrated by the contrast between the two panels of Figure 1. This point can be
confirmed by comparing (11) and (13a) at the threshold volatility associated with regime

A key variable is the adjustment cost parameter, θ, measuring the flexibility of
capital market adjustment. Greater flexibility of the adjustment reduces the role of

15
international reserves, and of the overall impact of volatility on investment and on the real
exchange rate.
Hoarding reserves mitigates the volatility of the real exchange rate and of the
adverse effects of liquidity shocks on the GDP. To fully appreciate this observation, it’s
useful to evaluate the expected output in the absence of the precautionary adjustment of
international reserves. Using the parameters specified in Figure 2a, the planned capital
is K1 = 1 . The actual capital in the presence of liquidity shock and the absence of the IR
precautionary adjustment would have been K1 = 1 − μεlH1 (1 + θ ) . The solid line in
Figure 3 plots the expected output in this regime as a fraction of the output had the
liquidity shock been zero. The bold line is the expected normalized output for the case
where reserves are adjusted to prevent the need to liquidate capital, as is the case in
equation (13). The figure vividly illustrates the first order gain associated with the
precautionary adjustment of international reserves. It is easy to verify that the
precautionary adjustment of reserves also reduces the volatility and the REER.
The present model is not detailed enough to identify who would hold the
international reserves – private banks, or the central bank. In the presence of capital
controls, like in China, the international reserves would be held by the central bank. With
full integration of capital markets and convertibility and an efficient market for excess
reserves that allows diversifying idiosyncratic shocks, the bulk of the international
reserves may be held by private banks. However, moral hazard considerations along the
line analyzed by Levy Yeyati (2005), or in the absence of an efficient market for
excessive reserves, international reserves would be held by the central bank.
The model we described is stylistic – we do not derive the collateral constraint
endogenously, and we do not claim that the debt contract or the resolution of the liquidity
shock is the most efficient one. Taking the debt contract exogenously given, we
characterize the resultant role of international reserves.9 See Ranciere, Tornell and
9

We also do not model the mechanism inducing capital flight in the presence of adverse
terms of trade shocks. This may reflect both contagion and the possibility of multiple
equilibrium, or fundamental forces. For further discussion on “fundamentals based
Crisis” see Allen and Gale (1998) and Goldfajn and Valdes (1997); for panic based see
Chang and Velasco (1999).

16
Westermann (2003) for a discussion on the dynamic interaction between an unconstrained
traded sector and a constrained non-traded sector in the presence of liquidity pressure.
The model suggests that adverse liquidity shocks triggered by terms of trade
deterioration are accommodated by higher reserves and real depreciation, adjustments
that limit the needed liquidation of capital. While our framework dealt with one
investment cycle, it can be extended into a dynamic set up, where the next cycle
resembles a similar sequence, subject to updating the entrepreneurs’ initial wealth by the
profits of the previous investment cycle and by any outside income. In the extended
setup, terms of trade improvements (deterioration) would tend to lead to a further real
exchange rate appreciation (depredation). This would be the case in circumstances where
the entrepreneurs’ outside income includes proceeds from the exported commodity,
implying that higher wealth would increase the future demand for non-traded input.
Alternatively, this would be the case if the non traded input has other uses, the demand of
which rises with the wealth of the economy.

International reserves management and mercantilist motives

The discussion in the previous section viewed international reserve management
in the context of reducing the costs of economic volatility, reflecting the desire for selfinsurance against exposure to future sudden stops. This view faces a well-known
contender in a modern incarnation of mercantilism: international reserves accumulation
triggered by concerns about export competitiveness. This explanation has been advanced
by Dooley, Folkerts-Landau and Garber (2003), especially in the context of China. This
issue is of more than academic importance: the precautionary approach links reserves
accumulation directly to exposure to sudden stops, capital flight and volatility, whereas
the mercantilist approach views reserves accumulation as a residual of an industrial
policy, a policy that may impose negative externalities on other trading partners. Dooley,
Folkerts-Landau and Garber have interpreted reserves accumulation as a by-product of
promoting exports, which are needed to create better jobs, thereby absorbing abundant
labor in traditional sectors, mostly in agriculture. Under this strategy, reserves
accumulation may facilitate export growth by preventing or slowing appreciation –

17

“we argued that a sensible development policy might involve creating a distortion in
the real exchange rate in order to bias domestic investment toward export industries.
Sensible here means that the resulting capital stock will be superior to that generated
by a badly distorted domestic financial system and other relative price distortions
typical of emerging market countries.” [Dooley, Folkerts-Landau and Garber (2005)].
To put this discussion in a boarder context, the mercantilist explanation for
hoarding international reserves presumes that a monetary policy affecting the level of the
exchange rate has permanent real effects. While the view that monetary instability has
long run adverse real consequences is well supported by empirical studies, there is no
comparable body of evidence that validates the long run real impact of setting the level of
the nominal exchange rate. Indeed, anecdotal evidence suggests that the neo-classical
adjustment mechanism works “even” in China – economic growth leads to real
appreciation independently of the exchange rate regime.
The growing importance of foreign direct investment, and the observation that a
large hoarding of international reserves has occasionally occurred in countries
experiencing a large foreign direct investment inflow, put to the fore an extended version
of the “Revived Bretton Woods system,” where international reserves are viewed as a
collateral reducing the risk associated with FDI:

“Delivering goods and services up front is a crude form of collateral. But there is no
credible alternative. Market participants individually could pledge financial assets in
the center country, but the only way that the aggregate of the periphery can acquire
assets in the US is to run a current account surplus. In an important sense, the goods
and services already delivered to the US support the stock of US claims on the
periphery; it is the collateral that powers the entire development strategy.
The nature of the social collateral is so obvious it is hard to see. If the center cannot
seize goods or assets after a default, it has to import the goods and services before the
default and create a net liability. If the periphery then defaults on its half of the
implicit contract, the center can simply default on its gross liability and keep the
collateral. The periphery’s current account surplus provides the collateral to support
the financial intermediation that is at the heart of Asian development strategies. The
interest paid on the net position is nothing more than the usual risk free interest paid
on collateral.” [Dooley, Folkerts-Landau and Garber (2005)].

18
The wide reaching implications of Dooley, Folkerts-Landau and Garber (2005)
has propagated spirited debate that goes well beyond the scope of our paper.10 Some
view the modern mercantilist approach as a valid interpretation for most East Asian
countries, arguing that they follow similar development strategies. This interpretation is
intellectually intriguing, yet it remains debatable. Observers have pointed out that high
export growth is not the new kid on the block -- it is the story of East- Asia during the last
fifty years. Yet, the large increase in hoarding reserves has happened mostly after 1997.
Indeed, one may argue that the experience of Japan and Korea suggests that during the
phase of their rapid growth, the policy tool of choice was selective favorable financing
targeted sectors, and not hoarding international reserves.11 In both countries large
hoarding of international reserves happened after the end of the high growth phase.
Aizenman and Lee (2005) test the importance of precautionary and mercantilist
motives in accounting for the hoarding of international reserves by developing countries.
While variables associated with the mercantilist motive (like lagged export growth and
deviation from Purchasing Power Parity) are statistically significant, their economic
importance in accounting for reserve hoarding is close to zero and is dwarfed by other
variables. Overall, the empirical results in Aizenman and Lee (2005) are in line with the
precautionary demand. The effects of financial crises have been localized, increasing
reserve hoarding in the aftermath of crises mostly in countries located in the affected
region, but not in other regions. A more liberal capital account regime is found to increase
the amount of international reserves, in line with the precautionary view. These results,
however, do not imply that the hoarding of reserves by countries is optimal or efficient.
Making inferences regarding efficiency would require having a detailed model and much
more information, including an assessment of the probability and output costs of sudden
stops, and the opportunity cost of reserves.

10

See Caballero, Farhi and Gourinchas (2006), Eichengreen (2006a), and the overview
in Glick and Spiegel (2005).
11

Interestingly, during the period of rapid growth, both Korea and Japan were closed to
FDI. Hence, the view that FDI is the key for successful development in East Asia
remains debatable.

19
Aizenman and Lee (2006) proposes a new interpretation of the association
between mercantilism, economic growth and hoarding reserves by looking at the
development strategies of East Asian countries during the second half of the 20th Century.
The history of the region suggests the prevalence of export promotion by preferential
financing, which effectively subsidized investment in targeted sectors. This was achieved
in several ways, including direct subsidies funded by state banks; or by means of financial
repression where favored sectors enjoyed preferential access to cheaper external
borrowing; or via “moral suasion” where private banks were encouraged to provide
favorable financing. We refer to this policy as financial mercantilism, and contrast it
with monetary mercantilism, a policy that hinges on hoarding international reserves.
The history of Japan and Korea suggests the (near) absence of monetary
mercantilism during the phase of fast growth. Evidence suggests that financial
mercantilism had been vigorously applied during the phase of rapid growth. In both
countries, the switch to large hoarding of international reserves happened at times of
collapsing growth. Thus, if monetary mercantilism played any significant role in these
countries, it was adopted in periods of disappointing growth. The legacy of financial
mercantilism led to deteriorating balance sheets of affected banks. Circumstances where
floundering growth leads to the switch from financial mercantilism to large hoarding of
reserves are associated with growing fragility of the banking system -- financial fragility
is more sustainable in times of rapid growth, but it may induce banking crises when
growth flounders.12 In these situations, precautionary motives may lead countries to
hoard international reserves in order to mitigate the possible transmission of banking
crisis to currency crisis. With limited data, such a response may be observationally
equivalent to the one predicted by monetary mercantilism. Having good data about
international reserves but spotty data on non performing loans, it is hard to disentangle
12

The research triggered by Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) points out that greater
financial fragility increases the odds of currency crisis. Hutchison & Noy (2005) report
that “… the onsets of 31% of banking crises were accompanied by currency turmoil.
Furthermore, there is a statistically significant correlation between lagged banking crises
and contemporaneous currency crises but not vice versa.” This observation is consistent
with the insight of models of financial fragility, exemplified by Chang and Velasco
(1999).

20
the precautionary hoarding from the monetary mercantilism. Moreover, monetary
mercantilism and precautionary hoarding may be mutually complementary: the
competitiveness benefit may reduce the effective cost of hoarding reserves and induce
governments to prefer reserve-hoarding over alternative precautionary means.
China’s hoarding of reserves picked up sharply after the Asian crisis. Unlike
Korea and Japan, China is accumulating reserves without having gone through a sharp
slow-down in economic growth. We conjecture that the recent history of Japan and
Korea provided evidence encouraging China to adopt a dual strategy of financial
mercantilism and rapid hoarding of international reserves. Arguably, as much as China is
growing even faster than Korea and Japan in their early years and is going through its
take-off process in the era of a highly integrated global financial market, China faces
much greater downside risk of social and political instability associated with a crisis than
the risk that confronted Korea or Japan. This greater downside risk of recession and
financial crisis may explain both the Chinese eagerness to push financial mercantilism,
and to buffer the downside risk of the growing financial fragility with aggressive reserve
hoarding.13 Given the sheer size of China and its reserve hoarding, however, other
countries in the region may be tempted to engage in competitive hoarding in order to
mitigate the competitiveness loss in third markets.
Furthermore, monetary mercantilism is associated with negative externalities akin
to competitive devaluation. Hoarding international reserves motivated by short-run
competitiveness concerns of one country may trigger other countries into adopting a
similar policy, to preempt any competitive advantage gained by the first country. These
circumstances may lead to competitive hoarding of reserves, which in turn would
dissipate any competitiveness gains. We provide a simple framework illustrating the
welfare losses associated with competitive hoarding. These losses may provide a novel
argument in favor of regional funds, viewed as a mechanism to cope with regional

13

In the case of China, the ratio of banks’ non performing loans/international reserves is
estimated to be in the range of about 20% (according to the Bank of China) to more than
90% (see Jim Peterson’s report at the International Herald Tribune, 9-11-2006). These
numbers indicate a large uncertainty associated with estimating the economy-wide burden
of financial weakness, which itself would add to the demand for precautionary hoarding.

21
negative externalities. The greater importance of manufacturing in East Asia relative to
Latin America, and the deeper financial repression in some East Asian countries suggests
that the case for Asian fund is stronger than that for a similar regional fund among Latin
American countries.14

4.

Current account persistence and international reserves

The purpose of this section is to ascertain the degree to which higher international
reserves/GDP ratios have been associated with greater capacity to smooth adjustment to
shocks overtime, allowing more persistent current account patterns. In contrast, a low
level of reserves may require a rigid and fast adjustment of the current account to shocks,
where deviations from a balanced current account position are hard to sustain. We
evaluate this possibility by applying the methodology of Taylor (2002), where the speed
of adjustment of the current account (CU) back towards its equilibrium or steady state
level, was captured by the value of β in the regression15

minus one implies no persistence of the current account pattern, as would be the case if
the adjustment to a shock is contemporaneous. In contrast, β closer to zero implies
greater persistence of the current account, allowing a more protracted adjustment to
shocks.
We start by fitting the following regression:

The presumption is that the real exchange rate has greater consequences on the
competitiveness of manufacturing exporters than on countries specializing in exporting
commodities and raw materials [for further discussion on regional funds see Eichengreen
(2006b)].

Developed OECD countries, Manufacture exporters, Natural Resource Exporters, Latin
American and Asian emerging economies. Table 4 also reviews sub samples based on
1980-1992 and 1993-2004, Indebtedness and Income as classifications given by the
World Bank. Note that developing countries are characterized by a faster current account
adjustment than the OECD, LATAM adjust faster than Asian emerging economies, and
exporter of natural resource countries adjust faster than the exporters of manufacturing.

Cross-section study of the factors affecting the persistence of the current account
balance

We turn now to a cross country study testing the impact of international reserves
on the speed of adjustment. On average, we expect that a higher build up of reserves
allows countries to be better buffered against shocks, thereby reducing the speed of
adjustment of the current account, resulting in a positive association between
international reserves and β. We apply a two step derivation of the relationship between
reserves (and other government assets) and current account persistence. In the first step
we derive a measure of current account persistence.
We ran a time series regression for each available country in the form of:

(18)

⎛ CU ⎞
⎛ CU ⎞
Δ⎜
⎟ = β⎜
⎟ + εt
⎝ GDP ⎠ t
⎝ GDP ⎠ t −1

This way we obtain one β coefficient per country. The countries, the number of
observations used in the autoregressive estimation of their β and the fitted values are
listed in Tables B1-B4, in Appendix B. Table 5 provides the estimates for several
LATAM countries.

23
The persistence proxy used in the next step is just the value for the pure
autoregressive process of the current account deflated by GDP:

(19)

⎛ CU ⎞
⎛ CU ⎞
⎜
⎟ = α⎜
⎟ + ε t where α = β + 1 .
⎝ GDP ⎠ t
⎝ GDP ⎠ t −1

In the second step we look at the cross section relationship between our measure of
persistence represented by α and a series of structural parameters for these economies,
and a measure of the stock of reserves deflated by the GDP. 16
In the univariate regressions, we find that higher reserves, higher GDP growth and
a lower share of commodities are associated with a significant increase in the persistency
of the current account for non OECD countries [see Table 6]. International reserves
turned out insignificant for a sample inclusive of the OECD countries. In the multivariate
regressions we find that for developing countries higher persistence is positively
associated with a higher IR/GDP, lower inflation, greater flexibility of the exchange rate
[measured by the volatility of the nominal exchange rate], and a higher share of
manufacturing [see Table 7].
The results reported above are consistent with the consumption smoothing role of
current account adjustments. To illustrate, consider a benchmark neo-classical economy
where consumption is determined the permanent income hypothesis (linear marginal
utility of consumption); the output follows an AR(1) process Yt − Y = ρ (Yt −1 − Y ) + Y ε t
( ρ < 1 , output reverting to the long run mean Y at a rate determined by 1 - ρ); and
where agents can borrow and lend at the real interest r, which also equals their subjective
rate of time preference. It can be shown that, around the long run equilibrium,17

16

Out of 134 countries, there are 10 countries with negative alphas that would represent
extreme volatility in the current account. These countries are generally small economies
with very sensitive external sectors. In order to reduce noise in future regressions we
purge these countries from the data. See the countries in Italics, Table B4, Appendix B.

sudden stops. Specifically, assume that the probability of a sudden stop, terminating the
ability to borrow externally, is Φ ; where Φ = Φ ( IR / Y ); Φ ' < 0 . In these circumstances,

α  ρ (1 − Φ) .

This suggests that a negative association between sudden stops and hoarding reserves
may account for the impact of international reserves on the persistency of current account
adjustment.

On the limitations of international reserves management

We close the paper with a discussion of the limitations of international reserves
management. While useful, IRM is not a panacea, and is subject to serious limitations
outlined below.
•

Moral hazard: as with any insurance, there is no way to avoid various layers of
moral hazard.

- Macro moral hazard: any deep pot of resources may be the target of
opportunistic raiding by policy makers in regimes characterized by political
instability and limited monitoring. Central bank independence helps and is
desirable, but not sufficient to overcome this obstacle [see Aizenman and Marion
(2004) for empirical results on the adverse effects of political instability on
hoarding international reserves].

25

- Micro moral hazard: large stockpiles of reserves may subsidize risk taking,
especially if it is viewed as a signal of a low probability of exchange rate changes
[see Levy Yeyati (2005), advocating a combined scheme of decentralized reserves
in the form of liquid asset requirements on individual banks to limit moral hazard,
and an ex-ante suspension-of-convertibility clause to reduce self-insurance costs
while limiting bank losses in the event of a run].
•

Fiscal costs: these costs include a direct opportunity cost (the marginal product of
investment or the cost of external borrowing), and any marginal costs of
sterilization [see Calvo (1991) for an early discussion on the quasi costs of
sterilization]. Hauner (2005) estimated these costs for 100 countries during 1990–
2004, concluding that while most countries made money on their reserves during
1990–2001, most have been losing money during 2002–04. One should keep in
mind, however, the difficulties in tracing the full benefits of hoarding reserves:
“While assessing the fiscal cost of holding reserves, it would be worthwhile to set off the
benefits that the country may have in holding reserves. In any country risk analysis by the
rating agencies and other institutions, the level of reserves generally has high weights.
Moreover, it is essential to keep in view some hidden benefits which could accrue to a country
holding reserves, which may, inter alia, include: maintaining confidence in monetary and
exchange rate policies; enhancing the capacity to intervene in foreign exchange markets;
limiting external vulnerability so as to absorb shocks during times of crisis; providing
confidence to the markets that external obligations can always be met; and reducing volatility
in foreign exchange markets. It is true that beyond a point, when the credit rating reaches
appropriate investment grade, addition to reserves may not lead to further improvement in the
credit rating. It is necessary to recognize that, as in the case of costs, there are difficulties in
computing the benefits too.”

Dr. YV Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India / Mumbai Sep 20, 2006
•

Coordination issues: while our focus was on IRM as self insurance, IRM
management may be part of a fiscal scheme dealing with augmenting social
security and future pensions. This is especially relevant for countries exporting
commodities, like Chile, Norway, etc. This suggests the need to delegate the
management of these funds to two different agencies. One, like the central bank,
should deal with IRM as part of prudent macroeconomoic management

26
throughout the business cycle. The second fund fits more the treasury, or the
social security administration, as it deals with long term intergenerational transfer.
For further discussion, see Davis et. al. (2001).
To conclude, this paper outlined several motives for hoarding international reserves in the
era of growing financial integration. The message of the report is mixed –management of
reserves is not a panacea. The mercantilist case for hoarding international reserves, as an
ingredient of an export led growth strategy, is dubious. Done properly, international
reserve management reduces the downside risk in turbulent times. These benefits are
especially important for commodity exporting countries; and countries with limited
financial development.

Interest Rates:
-Deposit Rates: rates offered to resident customers for demand, time, or savings
deposits.
-Lending Rates: bank rate that usually meets the short- and medium-term
financing needs of the private sector. This rate is normally differentiated
according to creditworthiness of borrowers and objectives of financing.

Terms of Trade: As usual, TOT is calculated as the ratio of export to import price
indexes.
Real Output:
-Real Aggregate Demand
-Real GDP

External Perception of Country Specific Risks:
-Economic Risk: A means of assessing a country's current economic strengths
and weaknesses. In general, where strengths outweigh weaknesses, a country will
show low risk and where weaknesses outweigh strengths, the economic risk will
be high. To ensure comparability between countries, risk components are based on
accepted ratios between the measured data within the national economic/financial
structure, and then the ratios are compared, not the data. Risk points are assessed
for each of the component factors of GDP per head of population, real annual
GDP growth, annual inflation rate, budget balance as a percentage of GDP, and
current account balance as a percentage of GDP. Risk ratings range from a high of
50 (least risk) to a low of 0 (highest risk), though lowest de facto ratings are
generally near 15.
-Financial Risk Rating: A means of assessing a country's ability to pay its way
by financing its official, commercial and trade debt obligations. To ensure
comparability between countries, risk components are based on accepted ratios
between the measured data within the national economic/financial structure, and
then the ratios are compared, not the data. Risk points are assessed for each of the
component factors of foreign debt as a percentage of GDP, foreign debt service as
a percentage of exports of goods and services (XGS), current account as a
percentage of XGS, net liquidity as months of import cover, and exchange rate
stability. Risk ratings range from a high of 50 (least risk) to a low of 0 (highest
risk), though lowest de facto ratings are generally near 20.

Econometric Analysis
Single OLS Equation: Effects of TOT into Financial Variables

The OLS indicates that an improvement in the TOT is associated with:
• A drop of the financial spread = [lending rates - deposit rates]
• Improvement in Chile’s financial and economic risk assessment.
• A positive gap between both the Real Output and the Real Demand and
their long run trend.
• Higher growth rate of M1.
• Lower growth rate of private credit (M3-M1).

The VAR analysis shows properties similar to the ones uncovered by the OLS approach; a
positive shock to the growth rate of TOT is associated with:
• A drop in the same order of magnitude of both the lending and the deposit rate. The
negative impact is slightly bigger in the lending rate which may help explain the negative
coefficient of the domestic spread in the single OLS equation.
• Improvement in Chile’s external risk evaluation.
• Higher growth rate of M1, and lower growth rate of private credit (M3-M1).
• Higher real aggregate demand. The initial positive effect is then quickly reversed after
the first lag.
Table A4 reports the variance decomposition of the previous VAR. The analysis shows that
changes in the growth rate of TOT absorb a significant variance from variables like the real
aggregate demand, deposits and lending rates, money supply growth and private credit. For this
decomposition we assume TOT to be the most exogenous measure so we place this variable last
in the Cholesky order.

The time line

Beginning of period 1:
Entrepreneurs with initial wealth H1 , subject to collateral constraint μ, use
bank financing μH 1 . The combined liquidity (1 + μ ) H1 finances
investment K1 and hoarding reserves, R1 , (1 + μ ) H 1 = K 1 + R1 .

End of period 1:
Liquidity shock materializes; an adverse shock δ ; δ < 0 induces deposit drop
of l (−δ ) μ H1 . Æ Reserves R1 are used to finance any liquidity shock and to
hire non-traded specific input z (at p1 ). Costly liquidation of capital from K1
to K1 ; K1 ≤ K1 would boost liquidity by [ K1 − K1 ] /(1 + θ ); θ ≥ 0 .

Period 2:

a

Output materializes, y2 = K1β z1− β ; Non-liquidated deposits are paid return
rf . Any non used reserves yield return rf .
