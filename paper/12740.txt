Comparing Two Variants of Calvo-Type Wage Stickiness
Stephanie Schmitt-Grohe and Martin Uribe
NBER Working Paper No. 12740
December 2006
JEL No. E31,E52
ABSTRACT
We compare two ways of modeling Calvo-type wage stickiness. One in which each household is the
monopolistic supplier of a differentiated type of labor input (as in Erceg, et al., 2000) and one in which
households supply a homogenous labor input that is transformed by monopolistically competitive
labor unions into a differentiated labor input (as in Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe, 2006a,b). We show that
up to a log-linear approximation the two variants yield identical equilibrium dynamics, provided the
wage stickiness parameter is in each case calibrated to be consistent with empirical estimates of the
wage Phillips curve. It follows that econometric estimates of New Keynesian models that rely on log-linearizations
of the equilibrium dynamics are mute about which type of wage stickiness fits the data better. In the
context of a medium-scale macroeconomic model, we show that the two variants of the sticky-wage
formulation give rise to the same Ramsey-optimal dynamics, which call for low volatility of price
inflation. Furthermore, under both specifications the optimized operational interest-rate feedback rule
features a large coefficient on price inflation and a mute response to wage inflation and output.

Introduction

Nominal wage stickiness is a central characteristic of postwar U.S. aggregate data. Existing
estimates of the wage Phillips curve document a low sensitivity of changes in wage inflation
with respect to deviations of real wages from the marginal disutility of labor. A number of
recent studies model wage stickiness as arising from Calvo-type staggering. The purpose of
this paper is to compare two variants of the Calvo-type wage-stickiness model.
The first variant we consider is the one due to Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000),
hereafter EHL. In this model, each household is the monopolistic supplier of a differentiated
type of labor input and equilibrium effort intensity varies across households. The other
version of wage stickiness we consider is the one developed in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe
(2006a,b), hereafter SGU. In this variant, households supply a homogeneous labor input
that is transformed by monopolistically competitive labor unions into a differentiated labor
input and every household works equal hours in equilibrium.
We embed both versions of wage stickiness into the medium-scale macroeconomic model
of Altig et al. (2005). This model features a large number of nominal and real rigidities,
including price stickiness, money demand by households and firms, habit formation, variable
capacity utilization, investment adjustment costs, and imperfect competition in product and
labor markets. The Altig et al. model is of particular empirical interest because it has been
shown to account well for the observed effects of monetary and supply-side shocks.
We first establish analytically that up to a log-linear approximation the SGU and EHL
variants of wage stickiness yield identical expectations-augmented wage Phillips curves. It
follows that econometric estimates of this relationship are necessarily mute about which type
of wage stickiness fits the data better. We derive the precise mapping from the wage Phillips
curve coefficient to the deep structural parameter governing the degree of wage stickiness in
the SGU and EHL models. We find that in the context of the EHL framework, the available
empirical estimates of linear wage Phillips curves imply that nominal wages are reoptimized
every 3 to 4 quarters. At the same time, we find that according to the SGU model, available
estimates of the relationship between wage inflation and wage markups imply that nominal
wages are reoptimized much less frequently, only about every 10 to 12 quarters.
We demonstrate that up to a log-linear approximation the SGU and EHL variants of wage
stickiness yield identical equilibrium conditions, provided the wage stickiness parameter is
in each case calibrated to be consistent with empirical estimates of the wage Phillips curve.
This result implies that, for a given policy regime, both variants of wage stickiness give rise
to identical equilibrium dynamics up to first order. A further consequence of this equivalence
result is that the impossibility of identifying whether wage stickiness stems from the SGU

1

or the EHL mechanism is not limited to econometric studies estimating the wage Phillips
curve in isolation, but extends to studies estimating the deep structural parameters of the
model from the complete set of log-linearized equilibrium conditions (such as Altig et al.,
2005, Levin et al., 2006, and Smets and Wouters, 2004).
We characterize Ramsey optimal policy under SGU and EHL wage stickiness. The fact
that the SGU and the EHL models induce the same equilibrium dynamics up to first order
does not imply that Ramsey optimal policy under both types of wage stickiness is also
identical. This is because the first-order conditions of the Ramsey problem include not
only the complete set of equilibrium conditions, but also additional constraints involving
the derivatives of the equilibrium conditions with respect to all endogenous variables. We
find, however, that Ramsey dynamics are numerically the same under the SGU and EHL
formulations. Notably, the Ramsey policy calls for stabilizing price inflation. The optimal
standard deviation of inflation is 0.6 percent at an annualized rate.
We characterize optimal, operational interest-rate rules for the SGU and EHL formulations of wage stickiness. We consider interest-rate rules whereby changes in the interest rate
are set as a linear function of lagged price and wage inflation and lagged output growth. We
find that the same operational interest-rate rule is optimal in the SGU and EHL models. The
optimal rule is a pure inflation targeting rule, featuring a large coefficient on price inflation
and a mute response to wage inflation and output growth. This result is in sharp contrast
with the findings of Erceg et al. (2000), Canzoneri, Cumby, and Diba (2005), and Levin et al.
(2006). These authors find that under EHL wage stickiness, the best rule takes the form of
a pure wage-inflation targeting rule. We show that this discrepancy in results is attributable
to differences in the definition of what constitutes an operational interest-rate feedback rule.
Our findings that Ramsey dynamics and the optimal operational interest-rate rule are
numerically the same under the SGU and EHL variants of Calvo-type wage stickiness lead
us to conjecture that the welfare function of the Ramsey planner must be quite similar under
both formulations. We confirm this conjecture by deriving analytically the welfare criterion
of the Ramsey planner under SGU and EHL wage stickiness in the much simpler economic
environment of Erceg et al. (2000). In particular, we show that up to second order the
unconditional expectations of the period utility function are the same under the SGU and
EHL variants as the subjective discount factor approaches unity.
The remainder of the paper is organized in six sections. Section 2 presents the SGU
and EHL variants of nominal wage stickiness. Section 3 establishes that available estimates
of linear wage Phillips curves cannot discriminate between the SGU and EHL models. It
also derives the mapping from the coefficient of the Phillips curve to the wage stickiness
parameters in the two models. Section 4 demonstrates that Ramsey dynamics are the same
2

under SGU- and EHL-type wage stickiness. Section 5 shows that the same operational rule
is optimal under both formulations of wage stickiness. Section 6 characterizes analytically
second-order accurate welfare functions. Section 7 concludes. Matlab code to replicate the
numerical results presented in this paper is available on the authors’ websites.

Modeling Calvo-Type Wage Stickiness

In this section, we derive the SGU and EHL variants of Calvo-style wage stickiness. We
develop in detail the conditions describing equilibrium in the labor market, as this is the dimension along which the two approaches differ. The remaining blocks of the macroeconomic
model into which we embed the SGU and EHL wage stickiness mechanisms are shared by
these two formulations and are those presented in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2006b). The
Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2006b) model is a medium-scale economy featuring a number of
nominal and real rigidities. In addition to nominal wage stickiness, the model allows for
sticky prices, money demands by households and firms, monopolistic competition in product and labor markets, habit formation, investment adjustment costs, and variable capacity
utilization. Contrary to a common practice in the related literature, we do not allow for
subsidies in product and labor markets to undo the distortions stemming from imperfect
competition in those markets. In this model economy, business cycles are driven by stochastic variations in the growth rate of total factor productivity, investment-specific technological
progress, and government spending.

2.1

SGU Wage Stickiness

The economy is assumed to be populated by a large representative family with a continuum
of members. Consumption and hours worked are identical across family members. The
household’s preferences are defined over per capita consumption, ct , and per capita labor
effort, ht , and are described by the utility function
E0

β t U (ct − bct−1 , ht ),

t=0

where Et denotes the mathematical expectations operator conditional on information available at time t, β ∈ (0, 1) represents a subjective discount factor, and U is a period utility
index assumed to be strictly increasing in its first argument, strictly decreasing in its second argument, and strictly concave. The parameter b > 0 introduces habit persistence. To
facilitate comparison with the EHL model, we will at times appeal to the following spe3

cific functional form of the utility index, which is separable in consumption and leisure,
logarithmic in habit-adjusted consumption, and iso elastic in labor:
U (ct − bct−1 , ht ) = ln(ct − bct−1 ) −

Firms hire labor from a continuum of labor markets of measure 1 indexed by j ∈ [0, 1].
In each labor market j, wages are set by a monopolistically competitive union, which faces
−η̃ d
a demand for labor given by Wtj /Wt
ht . Here Wtj denotes the nominal wage charged

j 1−η̃
by the union in labor market j at time t, Wt ≡ 0 Wt
dj
is an index of nominal
d
wages prevailing in the economy, and ht is a measure of aggregate labor demand by firms.
A formal derivation of this labor demand function is presented in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe
(2006b). In each particular labor market, the union takes Wt and hdt as exogenous. The
case in which the union takes aggregate labor variables as endogenous can be interpreted as
an environment with highly centralized labor unions. Higher-level labor organizations play
an important role in some European and Latin American countries, but are less prominent
in the United States. Given the wage it charges, the union is assumed to supply enough

Households are assumed to have access to a complete set of nominal state-contingent
assets. Specifically, each period t ≥ 0, consumers can purchase any desired state-contingent
nominal payment Xt+1 in period t + 1 at the dollar cost Et rt,t+1 Xt+1 . The variable rt,t+1
denotes a stochastic nominal discount factor between periods t and t + 1. The household’s
period-by-period budget constraint is given by:

(4)

The variable xt ≡ Xt /Pt−1 denotes the real payoff in period t of nominal state-contingent
assets purchased in period t − 1. The variable πt ≡ Pt /Pt−1 denotes the gross rate of
consumer-price inflation.
We introduce nominal wage stickiness by assuming that each period in a fraction α̃ ∈ [0, 1)
of randomly chosen labor markets the nominal wage cannot be reoptimized. In these labor
4

markets nominal wages are indexed to past price inflation, denoted πt−1 , and long-run real
wage growth, denoted µz ∗ . The household chooses processes for ct , ht , xt+1 , and wtj so as to
maximize the utility function (1) subject to (3) and (4), the wage stickiness friction, and a
no-Ponzi-game constraint, taking as given the processes wt , hdt , rt,t+1 , and πt , and the initial
condition x0 . The household’s optimal plan must satisfy constraints (3) and (4). In addition,
letting β t λt wt /µ̃t and β t λt denote Lagrange multipliers associated with constraints (3) and
(4), respectively, the Lagrangian associated with the household’s optimization problem is

where w̃t denotes the real wage prevailing in the 1 − α̃ labor markets in which the union
can set wages optimally in period t. Because the labor demand curve faced by the union is
identical across all labor markets where the wage rate is optimized in period t, and because
the cost of supplying labor is the same for all markets, one can assume that wage rates, w̃t ,
are identical across all labor markets updating wages in a given period. In any labor market
i in which the union could not reoptimize the wage rate in period t, the real wage is given

µz ∗ πt−1 /πt , as nominal wages are fully indexed to past price inflation and long-run

It remains to derive the optimality condition with respect to the wage rate in those
markets where the wage rate is set optimally. To this end, it is of use to track the evolution

This expression states that in labor markets in which the wage rate is reoptimized in period
t, the real wage is set so as to equate the union’s future expected average marginal revenue to
the average marginal cost of supplying labor. The union’s
marginal revenue s periods after

its last wage reoptimization is given by η̃ w̃t k=1
. Here, η̃/(η̃ − 1) represents

the markup of wages over marginal cost of labor that would prevail in the absence of wage
stickiness. In turn, the marginal cost of supplying labor is given by the marginal rate of
(t+s)
t+s
substitution between consumption and leisure, or −Uλht+s
= wµ̃t+s
. The variable µ̃t is a
wedge between the disutility of labor and the average real wage prevailing in the economy.
Thus, µ̃t can be interpreted as the average markup that unions impose on the labor market.
The weights used to compute the average difference between marginal revenue and marginal
cost are decreasing in time and increasing in the amount of labor supplied to the market.

account that at any point in time the nominal wage rate in all labor markets in which wages

We note that because all job varieties are ex-ante identical, any wage dispersion (i.e., s̃t > 1)
is inefficient. This is reflected in the fact that s̃t is bounded below by 1 (see Schmitt-Grohé
and Uribe, 2006b, for a proof). Inefficient wage dispersion introduces a wedge that makes
the number of hours supplied to the market, ht , larger than the number of productive units
of labor input, hdt . In an environment without long-run wage dispersion, up to first order
the dead-weight loss created by wage dispersion is nil even in the short run. Formally, a
first-order approximation of the law of motion of s̃t yields a univariate autoregressive process
of the form s̃ˆt = α̃s̃ˆt−1 . This situation emerges, for example, when nominal wages are fully
indexed to long-run productivity growth and lagged price inflation, as is the case in the
present model. When wages are fully flexible, α̃ = 0, wage dispersion disappears, and thus
s̃t equals 1.

Equations (7)-(12) describe equilibrium in the labor market in the SGU model.
The Wage Phillips Curve in the SGU Model
Because most available estimates of the degree of wage stickiness are based on linearized
versions of the wage Phillips curve, it is of use to compare this relationship in the SGU and
EHL setups. Here we derive a log-linear approximation to the wage Phillips curve in the
SGU model. To facilitate comparison with the linearized wage Phillips curve that obtains in
the EHL model (to be derived in the next section), we assume that the period utility function
takes the specific form given in equation (2). Let πtW ≡ Wt /Wt−1 denote wage inflation in
period t. Then log-linearizing equations (7)-(12) around a steady state yields

A hat on a variable denotes its log-deviation from the deterministic steady state. Our economy displays long-run stochastic growth in wages and the marginal utility of consumption
stemming from variations in the growth rate of neutral and investment specific factor proγ=

ductivity (see Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2006b). For this reason, the variables wt and λt
display a stochastic trend in equilibrium. For these two variables, a hat denotes deviations
of a stationarity-inducing transformation of the respective variable. The inflation rate πt
appears in the wage Phillips curve because of our maintained assumption that wages are
indexed to past inflation.
Existing empirical studies (e.g., Altig et al., 2005 and Levin et al. 2006) estimate the
linear wage Phillips curve given above. Such estimates do not provide directly a measure of
the degree of wage stickiness α̃. Instead, they deliver an estimate of the coefficient γ on the
wage markup. In the SGU model, γ is related to α̃ by equation (14). In the next section, we
show that the EHL model implies a wage Phillips curve identical to the one given in (13).
The only difference between the linear Phillips curve in the SGU and EHL models lies in the
mapping between γ and α̃.

EHL Wage Stickiness

In this section, we present the household problem under the EHL wage-stickiness assumption.
The goal is to derive counterparts to equations (7)-(14). In the EHL model, the economy is
assumed to be populated by a large number of differentiated households indexed by j with
j ∈ [0, 1]. The preferences of household j are defined over per capita consumption, cjt , and
labor effort, hjt , and are described by the utility function

β t U (cjt − bcjt−1 , hjt ).

(15)

t=0

To facilitate aggregation, we assume that the period utility index is separable in habitadjusted consumption and labor effort and isoelastic in labor as in equation (2).
Household j is assumed to be a monopolistic supplier of labor of type j. The household
−η̃ d
faces a demand for labor given by Wtj /Wt
ht . The household takes Wt and hdt as exogenous. Given the wage it charges, household j is assumed to supply enough labor, hjt , to
satisfy demand. That is,

Household j chooses processes for cjt , hjt , xjt+1 , and wtj , so as to maximize the utility function (15) subject to (16) and (17), the wage stickiness friction, and a no-Ponzi-game constraint, taking as given the processes wt , hdt , rt,t+1 , and πt , and the initial condition xj0 .
The household’s optimal plan must satisfy constraints (16) and (17). In addition, letting

respectively, the Lagrangian associated with household j’s optimization problem is

Following EHL (2000), we assume that households can insure against the risk of not being
able to reoptimize the nominal wage. This assumption implies that the marginal utility of
income, λjt , is indeed the same across all households j ∈ [0, 1]. From this result and the fact
that every household faces the same labor demand function, it follows that all households
reoptimizing wages in a given period will choose to set the same nominal wage. Therefore,
we drop the superscript j from the variables λjt and w̃tj . Then, the only difference between
the optimality condition (19) and its counterpart in the SGU model, equation (6), is that
the argument of the marginal disutility of labor is household-specific in the EHL model (and
given by hjt+s ) whereas in the SGU model the argument of the marginal disutility of labor
is aggregate per capita labor effort (ht+s ). It follows that in the special case of preferences
that are linear in hours worked (ξ = 0 in equation (2)), the SGU and EHL models deliver
identical expressions for the optimality condition with respect to the wage rate. This result
is intuitive: if agents are risk-neutral with respect to hours worked, it is irrelevant whether
households pool employment uncertainty (as in the SGU model) or not (as in the EHL
model).
At this point existing models that use wage stickiness à la EHL (2000) proceed to loglinearizing the optimality condition for wages given in equation (19), yielding the well-known
linear wage Phillips curve. Because our eventual goal is to compute Ramsey dynamics and
to perform welfare evaluations, we are interested in deriving the true nonlinear wage Phillips
curve. To this end, we derive a recursive representation of equilibrium condition (19). We
explain this derivation in some detail, as it is a novel feature of the present paper. Let ft1
be defined as in equation (7). As before, let the number of hours worked in period t + s by

10

a household who received a wage change signal for the last time in period t be denoted by

t ht+s . Then define ft as

With these definitions at hand, the first-order condition with respect to w̃t , given in equation (19), can be written as ft1 = ft2 . To express ft2 recursively proceed as follows. Note that

Can Existing Econometric Evidence Distinguish Between the SGU and the EHL Models?

To derive a log-linear approximation to the wage Phillips curve in the EHL model, we continue to assume that the period utility function takes the specific form given in equation (2).
Log-linearizing equations (7), (9), (12), (20), and (21) yields equation (13) with
γ=

(1 − α̃β)(1 − α̃) 1

(22)

Existing econometric studies that estimate the degree of wage stickiness using aggregate
data are based on linear models. Studies that are limited to estimating the wage Phillips
curve deliver an estimate of the coefficient γ in equation (13).Because both the EHL and SGU
models give rise to a linearized Phillips curve of the form given in equation (13), estimates
of γ are not sufficient to tell the SGU and EHL models apart.
Furthermore, even is one were to estimate the complete set of linearized equilibrium
conditions using aggregate data (as in Altig, et al. Levin et al., and others), the SGU and
EHL models would continue to be observationally equivalent. This is because the parameter
α̃ appears only in the coefficient γ and because one can show that up to first order, all
equations of the general equilibrium model are identical in the SGU and EHL models (
except, of course, for the mapping between the coefficient γ and α̃).
Given an estimate of γ, one will draw different conclusions about the size of α̃ depending
on whether one assumes that the model displays EHL or SGU-type of wage stickiness. Let
α̃SGU denote the degree of wage stickiness that one would infer from given values for γ, ξ, β,
and η̃ in the SGU model of wage stickiness and similarly let α̃EHL be the inferred degree of
wage stickiness in the EHL model. It is clear from equations (14) and (22) that α̃SGU and
α̃EHL are linked by the following implicit function
(1 − α̃EHLβ)(1 − α̃EHL ) 1
(1 − α̃SGU β)(1 − α̃SGU )
=
α̃SGU
α̃EHL
1 + η̃ξ

(23)

Clearly, for a given value of γ the implied degree of wage stickiness is always higher in the
SGU than in the EHL model, or
α̃SGU > α̃EHL.
Figure 1 displays the graph of the implicit function linking α̃SGU to α̃EHL given in equation (23). In constructing the graph, we draw from the calibration used in Altig et al. (2005)
and set β = 1.03−1/4 , ξ = 1, and η̃ = 21. Consider, for example, a value of 0.69 for α̃EHL,

which is the degree of wage stickiness estimated by Altig et al. in their high-markup case
under the assumption of EHL-type wage stickiness. The corresponding value for α̃SGU is
0.9261. Thus, under the Altig et al. estimation of γ the SGU model implies that nominal
wages are reoptimized on average every 13 quarters, whereas the EHL model implies that
they are reoptimized every 3 quarters.

Ramsey Policy in the SGU and EHL Models

The Ramsey optimization problem consists in maximizing a weighted average of lifetime
utility of all households in the economy subject to the set of equations defining a competitive
equilibrium. Thus far, we have established that for a given monetary regime and up to first
order the SGU and EHL models of wage stickiness result in identical equilibrium dynamics
provided that in both models α̃ is chosen appropriately. This is because the linearized
equilibrium conditions of both models are the same. Furthermore, as we will show shortly, the
objective function of the Ramsey planner is the same in the SGU and EHL models. However,
it does not follow directly from these results that Ramsey dynamics must be the same in
the SGU and EHL models up to first order. The reason is that linear approximations to
the equilibrium conditions of the Ramsey problem involve higher than first-order derivatives
of the competitive equilibrium conditions. We therefore resort to a numerical analysis to
compare Ramsey dynamics under the SGU and EHL models.

4.1

The Ramsey Planner’s Objective Function

The SGU economy is populated by a representative household. As a consequence, the
Ramsey planner’s objective function coincides with that of the representative household.
Recalling that ht = s̃t hdt (see equation (10) and imposing the specific functional form for the
period utility function given in equation (2), we can write the Ramsey planner’s objective
function as
Vt ≡ Et

In the EHL economy, households are heterogeneous. In equilibrium consumption is identical across households but labor supply varies cross sectionally. We assume that the Ramsey
planner cares about all households equally. Therefore, the planner’s objective function is

t
follows that in the EHL model the Ramsey planner’s objective function is given by equation (24), which is identical to its counterpart in the SGU model. However, the evolution
of s̃t differs in the two models. In effect, taking into account that in the EHL model only a
fraction 1 − α̃ of households are allowed to reoptimize wages in any given period and that
every reoptimizing household charges the same wage, we can express the above expression
for s̃t recursively as follows:

The Ramsey problem in the SGU model consists in maximizing equation (24) subject
to the equilibrium conditions given in sections A.1 and A.2 of the appendix. The Ramsey
problem in the EHL model consists in maximizing equation (24) subject to the equilibrium
conditions given in sections A.1 and A.3 of the appendix.

4.2

The Optimal Degree of Inflation Stabilization

We compute Ramsey dynamics by approximating the Ramsey equilibrium conditions up to
first order. We calibrate the SGU and EHL models to the U.S. economy following SchmittGrohé and Uribe (2006b). Table 1 presents the values of the deep structural parameters
implied by our calibration strategy. The only structural parameter that takes a different
value in the SGU and EHL models is the degree of wage stickiness α̃. As discussed earlier,
there is a one-to-one relationship between α̃SGU and α̃EHL that makes both models consistent
with the empirical estimates of the wage Phillips curve. Altig et al. estimate α̃EHL to be
0.69. The corresponding value for α̃SGU is 0.9261. We adopt these values in our calibration
of α̃ in the EHL and SGU models, respectively.
Table 2 displays the standard deviation, first-order autocorrelation, and correlation with
output growth of price inflation, wage inflation, the nominal interest rate and the growth
rates of output, consumption, and investment. The table shows that the SGU and EHL
models imply identical second moments under the Ramsey policy. This result suggests that
differences in the characteristics of optimal monetary policy reported in studies using SGUor EHL-type wage stickiness must be attributed not to the way wage stickiness is modeled,

or to calibrations of the parameter α̃ that do not satisfy the one-to-one mapping linking these
two parameters given by equation (23).
Table 2 shows that under the Ramsey-optimal policy the volatility of inflation is low
at 0.6 percentage points at an annual rate. We take this number to suggest that inflation
stability should be a central goal of optimal monetary policy. Furthermore, the results shown
in the table suggest that in the Ramsey-optimal competitive equilibrium price inflation is
somewhat smoother than wage inflation. Finally, a remarkable feature of monetary policy
is that a significant degree of inflation stability is brought about with little volatility in the
policy instrument. In effect, the Ramsey-optimal standard deviation of the nominal interest
rate is only 0.5 percentage points at an annualized rate.

Optimal Operational Interest-Rate Rules

Thus far, we have established that the Ramsey-optimal policies in the SGU and EHL models
induce the same dynamics at business-cycle frequency. In this section, we ask what simple
interest-rate feedback rule comes closest to implementing the Ramsey policy in the SGU and
EHL models. We are particularly interested in comparing the values of the policy coefficients
under each of the two sticky-wage formulations.
Our focus is on simple operational interest-rate feedback rules. The conditions we impose
for a rule to be simple and operational are three: (a) The interest rate must be set as a
function of a small number of easily observable macroeconomic variables; (b) the rule must
result in a locally determinate competitive equilibrium; and (c) the rule must imply dynamics
for the nominal interest rate that respect the zero lower bound.
We consider interest-rate feedback rules whereby the nominal interest rate is set as a
linear function of lagged price and wage inflation and lagged output growth. Formally, we
study rules pertaining to the following two families:

where R∗ denotes the target value for the gross nominal interest rate, π ∗ denotes the target
value for the gross rate of price inflation, and µz ∗ denotes the long-run gross growth rate
of the economy. We set R∗ and π ∗ equal to their respective values in the deterministic

18

steady state of the Ramsey equilibrium, which for our calibration take the values 4.4 and
-0.4 percent per year. We set the parameter µz ∗ to 1.8 percent per year, which coincides
with the steady-state growth rate of the economy.
We limit attention to interest-rate rules that feature only lagged values of inflation and
output because we believe that it would be unrealistic to assume that the central bank
has knowledge of these indicators contemporaneously. To the extent that this is the case,
contemporaneous rules would fail to be operational. A second significant characteristic of
the rules we propose is that the policymaker is assumed to respond to deviations of output
growth from its long-run average. This characteristic represents a departure from much
of the related literature which focuses on an output-gap measure defined as deviations of
actual output from the level that would obtain in a flexible-price, flexible-wage economy.
We stay away from this latter measure of the output gap because we regard such concept
as less operational than the one we propose. This is because computing the flexible-price,
flexible-wage level of output requires knowledge of the values taken by all state variables on
a period-by-period basis. The output measure we propose requires knowledge only about
the long-run growth rate of the economy.
The interest-rate rule given in equation (25) is cast in terms of deviations of the nominal
interest rate from a constant target value R∗ . This specification, hence, presumes knowledge
on the part of the central bank of the parameter R∗ . In turn, given a target value of the
inflation rate (π ∗ ), knowledge of R∗ requires information about the long-run level of the
real interest rate. When estimates of the long-run real interest rate are imprecise, such
informational requirement may render the policy rule given in (25) nonoperational. A way
to avoid this problem is to formulate the interest-rate rule in terms of changes in the nominal
interest rate as in equation (26).
The optimal operational interest-rate rule is the operational interest-rate rule that maximizes the unconditional expectation of the welfare criterion given in equation (24). To
numerically compute the optimal rule, we discretize the policy parameter space (απ , αW , αy )
with a grid of points from 0 to 3 and step size 0.1 for each of the three policy coefficients.
That is, we evaluate unconditional welfare for 313 or 29,791 policy rules. For each of these
specifications, we compute a second-order accurate approximation to the unconditional expectation of the welfare criterion, EV0 , using the computer code developed by Schmitt-Grohé
and Uribe (2004a). (Matlab code to compute the optimal operational rule is available on
the authors’ websites.)
To ensure compliance with criterion (b) for operationality of the policy rule, which requires the associated competitive equilibrium to be locally unique, we eliminate all points
in the policy parameter space for which the equilibrium is either indeterminate or locally

inexistent. Criterion (c) for operationality of the policy rule demands that the zero bound on
nominal interest rates be observed. This restriction adds an occasionally binding constraint
to the set of equilibrium conditions. Because our numerical solution algorithm is based on
a perturbation argument, it is ill suited to accommodate occasionally binding constraints.
Consequently, we approximate the zero-bound constraint by requiring that two standard deviations of the nominal interest rate implied by the optimal rule not exceed the deterministic
steady-state value of the nominal interest rate. Formally, we impose
2 std(ln Rt ) < ln(R∗ ).
Table 3 displays the optimal operational interest-rate-rule coefficients in the SGU and
EHL models of wage-stickiness. We find that the optimal rule is identical for both models. It
takes the form of a pure inflation targeting rule in the sense that it responds aggressively to
deviations of price inflation from target and is completely insensitive to variations in either
wage inflation or output growth. Furthermore, the finding that the optimal interest-rate rule
responds only to price inflation holds regardless of whether the rule is specified in the level
of the interest rate or in its difference.
Our optimal operational interest-rate rule differs sharply from the ones obtained by Erceg
et al. (2000), Canzoneri et al. (2005), and Levin et al. (2006) in related papers comparing
price and wage inflation targeting in economic environments with Calvo-style nominal inertia
in product and labor markets. These authors find that the best rule takes the form of a pure
wage-inflation targeting rule. Of these studies, the one by Levin et al. uses an economic
environment closest to the one studied in the present paper. Levin et al. limit attention to
difference rules that respond only to contemporaneous values of wage and price inflation and
20

find the optimal coefficients to be αW = 3.2 and απ = 0. We note that this rule does not
qualify as operational under our definition, because it does not satisfy our requirement that
operational rules respond to lagged measures of inflation. Moreover, in the context of our
model the Levin et al. pure wage-inflation targeting rule would continue to be nonoperational
even if we relaxed the definition of operationality to allow for current-looking rules. For the
Levin et al. rule violates our criterion (c) for operationality, which requires the nominal
interest rate not hit its zero bound too frequently.1
Our baseline calibration assigns a larger degree of stickiness in product markets than in
labor markets (α = 0.8 versus α̃EHL = 0.69). This asymmetry, however, is not responsible
for our result concerning the optimality of a pure price-targeting rule. To substantiate this
claim, we reset the parameters α and α̃EHL at the common value of 0.75. This value is about
the average of the degrees of price and wage inertia assumed in our baseline calibration and
coincides with the one adopted by Erceg et al. (2000) and Canzoneri et al. (2005). We find
that under this parameterization the optimal operational rule continues to call for targeting
price inflation exclusively (απ = 3 and αW = αy = 0). The same operational rule emerges as
optimal in the SGU model, which requires setting α̃SGU at 0.943 to be in line with a value
of 0.75 for α̃EHL. Furthermore, we find that a pure wage-inflation-targeting rule (αW = 3
and απ = αy = 0) fails to be operational in the SGU and EHL models, as it violates the
requirement of infrequent violations of the zero bound on nominal interest rates.

Second-Order Accurate Welfare Functions

The facts that the SGU and EHL wage-stickiness formulations deliver identical Ramseyoptimal dynamics up to first order, identical optimal operational rules, and identical equilibrium conditions up to first order suggest that the welfare function associated with both
models must be similar up to second order. This impression is supported by the welfare levels reported at the bottom of table 2. There, we show that up to second order the Ramsey
policy induces an unconditional level of welfare of -183.1090 under the SGU specification
and of -183.0913 under the EHL specification.
In this section, we establish analytically the similarity between the welfare criteria in the
SGU and EHL models. To this end, we consider a much simpler economic environment than
the one studied thus far. In particular, we consider the sticky-price sticky-wage model of
Erceg et al. (2000). This model features no habit formation, no capital accumulation, no
money, no growth, and no variable capacity utilization. Furthermore, the Erceg et al. model

This difficulty with the Levin et al. rule emerges not only in the context of backward-looking rules, but
also when the rule is contemporaneous. See Primiceri (2006).

assumes the existence of subsidies to production and labor supply aimed at neutralizing
the distortions arising from the presence of monopolistic competition in product and factor
markets.
We find that up to second order, the difference in the unconditional expectation of the
period utility function under SGU and EHL wage stickiness, which we denote by E[UtSGU −
UtEHL ], is given by:2
E[UtSGU

To obtain this expression, we use the fact that up to second order both the SGU and EHL
model give rise to the same volatility of wage inflation, Var(ln(π W )). Also, the parameter γ
is the wage-markup coefficient in the linearized wage Phillips curve. Given an estimate of
the wage Phillips curve, γ takes the same value under SGU and EHL wage stickiness.
It is clear from the above expression that the unconditional expectation of the difference
in the period utility functions under the SGU and EHL wage-stickiness specifications vanishes
as the discount factor approaches unity. Formally,3
lim E[UtSGU − UtEHL ] = 0.

β→1

Clearly, because, as shown earlier, αSGU > αEHL, and recalling that Uh < 0, it follows
that welfare under the SGU formulation is always slightly smaller than under the EHL
specification, or EUtSGU < EUtEHL . This result appears to hold for the more complex model
studied earlier in the paper, as suggested by table 2.

Conclusion

The central goal of monetary authorities around the developed world is the stabilization of
price inflation. This policy target is explicit in some countries, like the United Kingdom, and
implicit in others, like the United States. This practice is in accordance with the prescriptions
stemming from most of the vast literature on the theory of monetary policy based on the
new Keynesian model. At center stage in this literature is the emphasis on nominal rigidities
taking the form of sticky prices.
A number of authors within the new Keynesian literature, most notably Erceg et al.
(2000), Canzoneri et al. (2005), and Levin et al. (2006), depart from the price-inflation

The derivation of this expression is available from the authors upon request.
Of course, this statement is true only insofar as Uh hVar(ln(π W )) remains bounded as the discount factor
approaches unity.

targeting recommendation and argue that central banks ought to concentrate their efforts
on targeting the rate of wage inflation. These authors stress the role of nominal wage
stickiness in shaping policy advise.
In a number of recent papers (Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2004b and 2006a,b), we have
argued that price-inflation continues to emerge as the optimal target variable in the context
of an estimated medium-scale model featuring both nominal wage and price inertia in conjunction with a number of other real and nominal frictions (including money demands by
households and firms, habit formation, investment adjustment costs, and variable capacity
utilization, among others). We argue that this framework is of particular empirical interest
because it has been shown to account well for observed U.S. postwar dynamics in response
to demand and supply shocks.
Levin et al. (2006) argue that our emphasis on price stability is a consequence of the
particular variant of the Calvo-style wage staggering mechanism that we used. Namely, the
SGU wage stickiness model discussed at length in the preceeding sections. In their view,
wage-inflation smoothing would emerge as the optimal monetary policy prescription if wage
stickiness was assumed to be of the EHL type. Specifically, Levin et al. (2006, p. 261) state
that “our analysis has followed Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000) in assuming that each
individual household provides a distinct labor service, whereas Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe
(2004[b]) assume that each household has a continuum of members providing all types of
labor services and that the household’s utility depends only on its total hours of work.
While such assumptions might seem to be merely technical details, in fact these differences
have fairly dramatic consequences for the first-order dynamics of wage inflation, the secondorder effects of cross-sectional wage dispersion, and the design of welfare-maximizing policy
rules.” The results of the present paper show that first-order equilibrium dynamics, the
Ramsey-optimal dynamics, and the form of the optimal policy rule are the same under the
SGU and the EHL variants of Calvo-type wage stickiness. Furthermore, we establish that
in the context of our medium-scale model price inflation targeting is optimal under both
formulations of wage stickiness.
The fact remains that a number of existing studies using essentially the same mediumscale theoretical framework arrive at fairly different recommendations for the design of monetary policy rules. The main contribution of the present study is to establish that these
differences are not attributable to the alternative variants of Calvo-type wage stickiness employed. In addition, our results suggest that part of the disparity in policy recommendations
originates from differences in the definition of what constitutes an operational interest-rate
rule. In particular, there appears to be no consensus in the literature on whether it is operational to include contemporaneous values of output and inflation as target variables in
23

the feedback rule. Also, there is no uniform treatment of the constraints that the zero lower
bound on nominal interest rates imposes on monetary policy. Most existing related studies
ignore these constraints altogether. Our stance in this paper is to admit as operational only
rules that respond to past indicators of inflation and aggregate activity and that induce low
volatility of the nominal interest rate to avoid frequent violations of the zero bound. A full
understanding of what lies behind the disparities in optimal policy across studies warrants
further investigation.

Appendix
This appendix lists the complete set of equilibrium conditions in the SGU and EHL models.
Suitable stationarity-inducing transformations were applied to variables containing a trend in
equilibrium. A derivation of the equilibrium conditions common to both models can be found
in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2006b). In the equations below, the parameter χ̃ measures the
degree of nominal wage indexation to lagged price inflation and long-run productivity growth.
To obtain the case of full indexation analyzed in the main body of the paper, set χ̃ = 1.
