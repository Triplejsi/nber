ABSTRACT
This paper disentangles fluctuations in disaggregated prices due to macroeconomic and sectoral conditions
using a factor-augmented vector autoregression estimated on a large data set. On the basis of this estimation,
we establish eight facts: (1) Macroeconomic shocks explain only about 15% of sectoral inflation fluctuations;
(2) The persistence of sectoral inflation is driven by macroeconomic factors; (3) While disaggregated
prices respond quickly to sector-specific shocks, their responses to aggregate shocks are small on impact
and larger thereafter; (4) Most prices respond with a significant delay to identified monetary policy
shocks, and show little evidence of a "price puzzle," contrary to existing studies based on traditional
VARs; (5) Categories in which consumer prices fall the most following a monetary policy shock tend
to be those in which quantities consumed fall the least; (6) The observed dispersion in the reaction
of producer prices is relatively well explained by the degree of market power; (7) Prices in sectors
with volatile idiosyncratic shocks react rapidly to aggregate monetary policy shocks; (8) The sector-specific
components of prices and quantities move in opposite directions.

Introduction

In this paper, we document the eﬀects of macroeconomic fluctuations on disaggregated prices.
Whether prices are generally flexible or sticky has been for a long time the subject of considerable
controversy in macroeconomics. A proper assessment of the speed of price adjustment is crucial to
understand the sources of business cycle fluctuations, as well as the eﬀects of monetary policy on
the economy.
Numerous studies focusing on specific wholesale or retail items have found evidence of prices
maintained fixed for several months, in the U.S.1 Surveys of firms also suggest that a large fraction of prices remain constant for many months (Blinder, Canetti, Lebow, and Rudd, 1998). In
addition, studies involving vector autoregressions (VAR) usually provide evidence of stickiness of
the aggregate price level. For instance, under a wide range of identifying assumptions, following an unexpected monetary policy tightening, aggregate price indices are commonly found to
remain unchanged for about a year and a half, and start declining thereafter (see, e.g., Christiano,
Eichenbaum and Evans, 1999). Largely motivated by this evidence, many macroeconomic models including models used for policy analysis rest on the assumption that prices are sticky. Such
models, sometimes augmented with mechanisms to increase the persistence in inflation, have been
argued to replicate many features of aggregate data (e.g., Rotemberg and Woodford, 1997; Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans, 2005; Smets and Wouters 2004), and in particular the delayed and
persistent eﬀects of monetary policy shocks on prices.
However, recent evidence on disaggregated prices series has cast doubts on the validity of existing
models with price rigidities. For instance, Bils and Klenow (2004) find that disaggregated consumer
prices are much more volatile than conventionally assumed in studies based on aggregate data.
In fact, looking at 350 categories of consumer goods and services that cover about 70% of U.S.
consumer expenditure, Bils and Klenow (2004) estimate that the median time between price changes

MacDonald and Aaronson (2001), and Kackmeister (2001).

is 4.3 months.2 The duration between price changes varies however considerably across sectors.3
Bils and Klenow (2004) argue that sectoral inflation rates are much more volatile and short-lived
than implied by simple sticky-price models. Klenow and Kryvtsov (2005) document that when
prices change, they change by more than 13% on average, or by 8.5% when adjusting for temporary
sales. Golosov and Lucas (2003), in turn, calibrate a menu-cost model with both aggregate and
idiosyncratic shocks to match these facts, and find that monetary policy shocks have large and
rapid eﬀects on aggregate prices but only very little eﬀect on economic activity.
The evidence about relatively flexible individual prices thus contrasts sharply with the evidence
obtained from aggregate price indices. While simple sticky-price models designed to explain aggregate price behavior appear to explain poorly the behavior of more disaggregated price series, models
with relatively flexible sectoral prices do not seem to explain the empirical evidence obtained from
aggregate series.
How then, can the facts just laid out be reconciled? One possibility is that studies based on
aggregate series mistakenly assume that prices are sticky in the face of macroeconomic fluctuations,
when in fact prices adjust more frequently to changes in economic conditions. In such a case, sectoral
prices would be expected to respond on average rapidly to macroeconomic disturbances such as
monetary policy shocks. And they would be expected to respond more rapidly in sectors that
adjust prices more frequently. Another possibility is that prices respond diﬀerently to sectoral and
macroeconomic shocks. In that case, individual prices may respond rapidly and strongly to shocks
specific to the particular price categories, but may adjust more slowly to aggregate macroeconomic
factors.
In addition, while aggregate inflation is often argued to be persistent over long samples,4 disaggregated series appear much more transient. Several authors have argued that the apparent
persistence of aggregate inflation may reflect an aggregation bias or a structural break in the
2

The median duration remains below 5 months when they account for temporary sales. More recently, however,
Nakamura and Steinsson (2006), analyzing CPI microdata, argue that the median duration is between 8 and 11
months when they exclude sales and price changes due to product substitutions. The upper bound is similar to the
median duration found in Euro area data (see, e.g., Dhyne et al., 2005, and several other studies which are part of
the Eurosystem Inflation Persistence Network).

It ranges from less than a month (for gasoline prices) to more than 80 months (coin-operated apparel laundry
and dry-cleaning).

mean inflation during the sample.5 Yet, as another possible explanation, the diﬀerences in inflation persistence at the aggregate and disaggregate level may also be due to diﬀerent responses to
macroeconomic and sector-specific shocks.
One limitation of the existing evidence such as that of Bils and Klenow (2004), Klenow and
Kryvtsov (2005) is that while they provide a careful description of individual prices movements,
they do not distinguish between sector-specific and aggregate sources of fluctuations. It thus not
possible to infer from these studies whether sectoral prices respond rapidly or slowly, strongly or
moderately to macroeconomic shocks. Such distinctions would however provide crucial insights
on the determination of prices, hence guidance for the development of appropriate macroeconomic
models.
In this paper, we disentangle the fluctuations in disaggregated U.S. consumer and producer
prices which are due to aggregate macroeconomic factors from those due to sectoral conditions. We
do so by estimating a factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) that relates a large panel of
economic indicators and individual price series to a relatively small number of estimated common
factors. This framework allows us to assess the relative importance of macroeconomic and sectoral
disturbances in determining disaggregate price fluctuations, and to decompose the persistence in
inflation in terms of macroeconomic and sector-specific factors. Using this, we can analyze the
typical response of disaggregate prices to macroeconomic shocks and to sector-specific shocks.
In addition, we estimate the eﬀects of U.S. monetary policy on disaggregated prices after identifying monetary policy shocks using the information from the entire data set. We study the
magnitude of the price responses to monetary policy shocks, and whether monetary policy has
delayed eﬀects on prices. While extensive research has attempted to characterize the eﬀects of
monetary policy on macroeconomic indicators, little research has analyzed its eﬀects on disaggregated prices. Two exceptions are Bils, Klenow and Kryvtsov (2003), and Balke and Wynne (2003).
These authors estimate the responses of individual prices to a monetary policy shock by appending individual price series to a separately-estimated VAR. However, their estimated price responses
5

Pesaran and Smith (1995) and Imbs, Mumtaz, Ravn and Rey (2005) argue that heterogeneity – across categories
– in the persistence of individual series may result in a large estimated persistence of the aggregate even if individual
series display on average little persistence. Cogley and Sargent (2001, 2005), Levin and Piger (2003) and Clark (2003)
find that inflation persistence drops when they allow for changes in mean inflation over time.

display a considerable “price puzzle”, i.e., a price increase following an unexpected monetary policy
tightening, which stands in sharp contrast to predictions of conventional models. As argued in Sims
(1992) and Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz (2005), such evidence of a price puzzle may be indicative
of VAR misspecification due, e.g., to the lack of information considered in the VAR estimation. In
the context of our data-rich FAVAR, this risk of misspecification is considerably reduced, as we
use all of the available information in the estimation. Consistency of our estimates is furthermore
guaranteed by the fact that we estimate within the same framework the parameters describing
the dynamics of the common factors and the parameters that relate the individual price series to
common factors.
After documenting the responses of prices to a monetary policy shock, we attempt to provide
an explanation for the cross-sectional dispersion of price responses. To this end, we collect data on
industry characteristics that are related to various theories of price stickiness. In general, models
that allow for imperfect competition and variable speed of price adjustment predict that firms in
very competitive industries will react quickly to changes in the economic environment (see Barro,
1972). The standard workhorse monetary model with Calvo pricing assumes a fixed degree of price
stickiness as measured by the probability of re-optimizing prices, so that industry characteristics do
not aﬀect this probability. Extensions of this model allow diﬀerences in probabilities of re-optimizing
prices across sectors (see, e.g., Aoki, 2001; Benigno, 2003; Woodford, 2003, Chap. 3; Carvalho,
2006), but these models still do not explain why diﬀerences in the speed of price adjustments might
emerge as part of the optimizing behavior of firms. Nevertheless, in these New Keynesian models,
one industry characteristic – the degree of competition – aﬀects directly the degree of strategic
complementarity (or “real rigidity” as in Ball and Romer, 1990) in price setting, and therefore the
trajectory of price adjustment.
Our main findings can be summarized as follows:
First, most of the fluctuations in sectoral inflation rates are due to sector-specific factors. On
average, only about 15% of inflation fluctuations are due to macroeconomic factors (17% for personal consumption expenditure prices and 13% for producer prices). Thus, the relative flexibility
of sectoral prices found by Bils and Klenow (2004) is to a large extent due to sector-specific disturbances. Consistent with the evidence on disaggregated price series, we also find considerable
4

disparities in the magnitude of price changes and in the persistence of inflation across price categories, both for consumer and producer prices. These disparities are due to a large extent to
diﬀerences in the volatility of sector-specific components, and only little to diﬀerent responses to
macroeconomic factors.
Second, sectoral inflation fluctuations are persistent, but this persistence is driven primarily by
common macroeconomic components and not by sector-specific disturbances. While sector-specific
shocks may cause large fluctuations in the individual inflation rates, these fluctuations are shortlived on average. In contrast, aggregate macroeconomic shocks tend to have more persistent eﬀects
on a wide range of sectoral inflation rates.
Third, prices and quantities respond diﬀerently to macroeconomic shocks and to sector-specific
shocks. While sector-specific shocks induce an immediate and permanent change in sectoral prices
and quantities, macroeconomic shocks have a small impact on prices and quantities but they generate larger eﬀects thereafter.
Fourth, most prices respond with a significant delay to identified monetary policy shocks, and
show little evidence of a “price puzzle,” contrary to existing studies based on monetary policy
shocks identified from small-scale VARs. This suggests that exploiting a large information set in
the estimation provides more accurate estimates of the eﬀects of monetary policy.
The picture that emerges then, is one in which many prices fluctuate considerably in response
to sector-specific shocks, but they respond only sluggishly to aggregate macroeconomic shocks such
as monetary policy shocks. This diﬀerence in responses to various shocks can explain why, at the
disaggregated level, individual prices are found to be adjusted relatively frequently, while estimates
of the degree of price rigidity are much higher when based on aggregate data. This explains why
models that assume considerable price stickiness have often been successful at replicating the eﬀects
of monetary policy shocks.
Looking across price categories, we find that the observed dispersion in the reaction of producer
prices is relatively well explained by the degree of market power, that prices in sectors with volatile
idiosyncratic shocks react rapidly to aggregate monetary policy shocks, and that PCE categories in
which prices fall the most following a monetary policy shock tend to be those in which quantities
consumed fall the least. Finally, we find that the idiosyncratic components of prices and quantities
5

move mostly in opposite directions suggesting that idiosyncratic shocks are supply-type shocks.
Our results are robust to changes in the sample. In particular we show that our main results
are qualitatively similar for the period after 1984.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the econometric framework,
by discussing the formulation and estimation of the FAVAR. In Section 3, we discuss various data
sets used in our estimation. Section 4 presents empirical results about the sources of fluctuations
in disaggregated prices. It includes a description of the price responses to sector-specific shocks
and to macroeconomic fluctuations. Section 5 investigates the eﬀects of monetary policy shocks
and relates the responses of producer prices in various sectors to industry characteristics. Section
6 reports some robustness results for the post-1984 sample. Section 7 concludes.

Econometric Framework: FAVAR

The empirical framework that we consider is based on the factor-augmented vector autoregression
model (FAVAR) described in Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz (2005) (BBE). One of its key features
is to provide estimates of macroeconomic factors that aﬀect the data of interest, by systematically and consistently exploiting all information from a large set of economic indicators. In our
application, we estimate the empirical model by exploiting information from a large number of
macroeconomic indicators, as well as from disaggregated data. This framework is particularly well
suited to decompose the fluctuations of each series into a common and a series-specific component.
It also allows us to characterize the response of all data series to macroeconomic disturbances, such
as monetary policy shocks. As BBE argue, this framework should lead to a better identification
of the policy shock than standard VARs, because it explicitly recognizes the large information set
that the Federal Reserve and financial market participants exploit in practice, and also because
it does not require to take a stand on the appropriate measures of prices and real activity which
can simply be treated as latent common components. A natural by-product of the estimation is
to obtain impulse response functions for any variables included in the data set. In particular, this
allows us to document the eﬀect of monetary policy on disaggregated prices.
We only provide here a general description of our implementation of the empirical framework

6

and refer the interested reader to BBE for additional details. We assume that the economy is
aﬀected by a vector Ct of common components to all variables entering the data set. Since we will
be interested in characterizing the eﬀects of monetary policy, this vector of common components
includes a measure of the stance of monetary policy. As in most related VAR applications, we
assume that the Federal funds rate, Rt , is the policy instrument. It will be allowed to have
pervasive eﬀect throughout the economy and will thus be considered as a common component of
all variables entering the data set. The rest of the common dynamics are captured by a K × 1
vector of unobserved factors Ft , where K is relatively small. These unobserved factors may reflect
general economic conditions such as “economic activity,” the “general level of prices,” the level of
“productivity,” which are not easily captured by a few time series, but rather by a wide range of
economic variables. We assume that the joint dynamics of Ft and Rt are given by

Ct = Φ(L)Ct−1 + vt

where

⎡

(1)

⎤

⎢ Ft ⎥
Ct = ⎣
⎦,
Rt

and Φ(L) is a conformable lag polynomial of finite order d, which may contain a priori restrictions,
as in standard structural VARs. The error term vt is i.i.d. with mean zero and covariance matrix
Q.
The system (1) is a VAR in Ct . The additional diﬃculty, with respect to standard VARs,
however, is that the factors Ft are unobservable. We assume that the factors summarize the
information contained in a large number of economic variables. We denote by Xt this N × 1 vector
of “informational” variables, where N is assumed to be “large,” i.e., N > K + 1. We assume
furthermore that the large set of observable “informational” series Xt is related to the common
factors according to
Xt = ΛCt + et

(2)

where Λ is an N × (K + 1) matrix of factor loadings, and the N × 1 vector et contains (mean-zero)
sector-specific components that are uncorrelated with the common components Ct . These sector7

specific components are allowed to be serially correlated and weakly correlated across indicators.
Equation (2) reflects the fact that the elements of Ct , which in general are correlated, represent
pervasive forces that drive the common dynamics of Xt . Conditional on the observed Federal funds
rate Rt , the variables in Xt are thus noisy measures of the underlying unobserved factors Ft . Note
that it is in principle not restrictive to assume that Xt depends only on the current values of the
factors, as Ft can always capture arbitrary lags of some fundamental factors.6
To estimate the system (1) — (2), we follow the two-step principal component approach described
in BBE. In the first step, the space spanned by the common components, Ct , is estimated using
the first K + 1 principal components of Xt . While the estimation does not exploit the fact that Rt
is observed, Stock and Watson (2002) show that the principal components consistently recover the
space spanned by both Ft and Rt , when N is large and the number of principal components used
is at least as large as the true number of factors. In the second step, a structural VAR is estimated
on these common components, after imposing that Rt is one of the common components.
This procedure has the advantages of being computationally simple and easy to implement. As
discussed by Stock and Watson (2002), it also imposes few distributional assumptions and allows for
some degree of cross-correlation in the idiosyncratic error term et . Boivin and Ng (2005) document
the good forecasting performance of this estimation approach compared to some alternatives.7

Data

The data set used in the estimation of our FAVAR is a balanced panel of 653 monthly series, for
the period running from 1976:1 to 2005:6. All data have been transformed to induce stationarity.
The details for this data set, as well as the transformation applied to each particular series, are
in Appendices A — D. The data set includes 111 updated macroeconomic indicators used by BBE,
and listed in Appendix A, which involve several measures of industrial production, various price
indices, interest rates, employment as well as other key macroeconomic and financial variables.
6

This is why Stock and Watson (1999) refer to (2) as a dynamic factor model.
Note that this two-step approach implies the presence of “generated regressors” in the second step. According to
the results of Bai (2003), the uncertainty in the factor estimates should be negligible when N is large relative to T .
Still, the confidence intervals on the impulse response functions reported below are based on a bootstrap procedure
that accounts for the uncertainty in the factor estimation.

These indicators have been found to collectively contain useful information about the state of the
economy for the appropriate identification of monetary policy. We expanded the data set of BBE
in two directions.
First, we appended disaggregated data published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis on personal consumption expenditure (PCE). Specifically, we collected 335 series on PCE prices and an
equal number of series on real consumption. Among these series, 35 price series and 35 real consumption series were removed because of missing observations. In order to capture data for all
expenditures reported, we removed the other series in the same categories and retained the series
at the immediately higher level of aggregation. However, we removed from our data set aggregate
price and real consumption series (except for overall aggregates), so as to count only once each
category in the disaggregated data. We thus ended up with 190 disaggregated PCE price series
and the 190 corresponding consumption series. At the level of disaggregation considered, we have
for instance data on new domestic autos, bicycles, shoes, cereals, fresh fruit, taxicabs, and so on.
In addition, we also included 4 price indices and 4 consumption aggregates (overall PCE, durable
goods, nondurable goods, and services). Further details on these series are provided in Appendix
B.
Second, in order to obtain a more detailed picture of the characteristics of price responses, we
also collected over 600 series for producer prices at the 6-digit level of NAICS codes (corresponding
to 4-digit SIC codes). Because of changes in definitions and data coverage, we managed to obtain
only 154 series for a longer period starting in January 1976 and ending in June 2005. Appendix C
provides a brief description of these series.
Besides the series just described, which we used to estimate the FAVAR, we also collected data
on industry characteristics, which could help us validate or reject assumptions underlying models of
price determination. The C4 ratio, provided by the Bureau of the Census, reports the percentage of
total sales attributable to the four largest firms in the industry. As another measure of competition,
we use also data on average gross profit rates from the Annual Survey of Manufacturing. This data
is available on an annual basis from 1997 to 2001. The cross-sectional industry data is described
in Appendix D.

Fluctuations in Disaggregated Prices: Macroeconomic Factors
and Sector-Specific Shocks

We estimated the system (1) — (2) for the period 1976:1- 2005:6, using the data just described, and
assuming 5 latent factors in the vector Ft . We experimented with more factors, but none of our
conclusions were aﬀected. We used 13 lags in estimating (1). The estimated system allows us to
analyze the sources of fluctuations in sectoral inflation rates. Note that for all of the price series
considered, (2) implies that
Xit = λ0i Ct + eit ,

(3)

where Xit contains the monthly log change in the respective price series. This formulation allows
us to disentangle the fluctuations in sectoral inflation rates due to the macroeconomic factors –
represented here by the common components Ct which have a diﬀuse eﬀect on all data series –
from those due to sector specific conditions represented by the term eit . It also allows us to study to
what extent the persistence in sectoral inflation rates is due to macroeconomic or sectoral shocks.
Note that since Ct is a vector which may contain elements with very diﬀerent dynamics and the
vectors of loadings λi may diﬀer across sectors, each sector-specific inflation rate may reveal diﬀerent
dynamics in response to macroeconomic disturbances. Recall also, that the sector-specific terms
eit are allowed to be serially correlated and weakly correlated across sectors.

4.1

Sources of fluctuations and persistence

In this subsection we discuss some summary statistics about the volatility and the persistence of
both aggregate and disaggregated monthly inflation series. The next subsection proceeds with a
discussion of the eﬀects of sector-specific and macroeconomic shocks.
4.1.1

Inflation volatility

As is indicated in the first column of Table 1, the standard deviation of aggregate inflation amounts
to 0.24% for the overall PCE series, and ranges between 0.24% and 0.42% for the inflation rates of
durable goods, nondurable goods and services. Most of the volatility in aggregate inflation is due

10

to fluctuations in common macroeconomic factors. In fact, the R2 statistic, which measures the
fraction of the variance in inflation explained by the common component λ0i Ct lies above 0.5 for all
of the aggregate measures.
The picture is however quite diﬀerent for more disaggregated inflation series. As the lower panel
of Table 1 shows, disaggregated inflation series are on average much more volatile than aggregate
series. On average (across sectors), the standard deviation of monthly inflation is 1.15% for all
price series considered (0.97% for PCE inflation and 1.36% for PPI inflation).8 As the columns
two to four reveal, most of the inflation volatility is however due to sector-specific disturbances. In
fact while the mean volatility of the common component to inflation lies at 0.33%, the volatility
of the sector specific component is more than three times as large. The results are roughly similar
for PCE and PPI inflation rates. As a result, the R2 statistic amounts to 0.15 on average (0.17 for
PCE and 0.13 for PPI).
Table 1 also reveals a considerable amount of heterogeneity across sectors in the volatility
of disaggregated inflation series. Whereas some series such as inflation of tenant-occupied rent
fluctuate even less than the inflation rate of the aggregate index, other series like the consumption
category “insurance premium for user-operated transportation” or the production category “other
oilseed processing” have monthly standard deviations close to 10%. This heterogeneity is due
to a large extent to diﬀerences in the volatility of sector-specific conditions, and much less so to
diﬀerences in the response to macroeconomic fluctuations. As the sector-specific components tend
to cancel each other out, inflation in the aggregate price indices ends up being less volatile than
most sector-specific inflation rates.
One interesting fact revealed by Figure 1 is that the volatility of the common and the sectorspecific components to inflation are strongly positively correlated across sectors. As shown in Tables
2a-2c the correlation between the volatility of idiosyncratic shocks (Sd(ei)) and the volatility of the
common component (Sd(com)) is high both for PCE deflators (0.69) and for PPI data (0.78).9
8

The average volatility of disaggregated PCE inflation series, weighted with expenditure shares, is somewhat lower
than the unweighted average, but the overall picture remains the same for the volatility as well as for other statistics
described below.
9
From a statistical point of view, there is no reason to expect that the portion of inflation volatility explained by
the regression (common component) and the portion of inflation volatility explained by the error terms should be
correlated across industries (or samples). Therefore, Figure 1 presents an interesting result that requires structural
interpretation.

11

Note that the inflation variance explained by the macroeconomic factors depends on the loadings
represented by the matrix Λ. One interpretation is that these loadings reflect the price setting
behavior of firms in various industries. Under this interpretation, Figure 1 reveals that firms
in industries with volatile idiosyncratic shocks do also respond strongly to macroeconomic shocks.
This is the case if frequent price adjustments necessitated by idiosyncratic volatility are also used as
an opportunity to adjust to changes in the macroeconomic environment. That would be consistent,
for instance, with a sticky price model a la Calvo with heterogeneity in the frequency of price
adjustment across sectors as in Carvalho (2006).10
4.1.2

Inflation persistence

One characteristic of aggregate inflation often discussed is its persistence. To assess the degree of
persistence, we fit for each inflation series Xit and each of its components, λ0i Ct and eit an AR(p)
process, of the form
wt = ρ (L) wt−1 + εt
where the lag-length p is selected on the basis of BIC, and we measure the degree of persistence by
the sum of the coeﬃcients on all lags, ρ (1) . Not surprisingly, as we report in Table 1, fluctuations
in aggregate inflation are persistent with a measure ρ (1) of 0.9 for the PCE inflation rate, and
ranging between 0.44 and 0.91 for the three main components of PCE inflation. This measured
persistence likely suﬀers from an upward bias. In fact, as argued in Pesaran and Smith (1995)
and Imbs, Mumtaz, Ravn, and Rey (2005), the estimated persistence is likely biased upward when
the components of the aggregate index display heterogenous dynamics, and the persistence of the
individual series and their variance are positively correlated. Another possible source of bias has
to do with a possible change in mean inflation during the sample.
As Clark (2003) noted, the sectoral inflation series display much less persistence than the aggregated series over the long sample. Similarly, Altissimo, Mojon and Zaﬀaroni (2004) who estimated
10

An alternative interpretation might be that industries with significant inherent volatility are riskier so that the
degree of asymmetric information between firms and lenders is more acute (since it is more diﬃcult for lenders to
determine the state of the world). In this case, more idiosyncratic volatility should make firms more vulnerable
to changes in monetary policy, which is known to aﬀect the wedge between internal and external financing (e.g.
Bernanke and Gertler, 1995).

12

a factor model on disaggregated CPI inflation series in Europe also found that inflation rates of
individual categories are on average more volatile and less persistent than the aggregate inflation
rate, and display widespread heterogeneity across categories. In our data set, the persistence is
0.29 on average over all sectors (0.30 for PCE inflation and 0.28 for PPI inflation). The inflation
persistence varies importantly across sectors. While it is negative for some producer and consumer
prices, it gets above 0.9 for the “health insurance” category of “worker’s compensation” and for
“rental value of farm dwellings.” Interestingly, while the inflation persistence is in some cases due to
series-specific factors, such as in the categories just mentioned, the inflation persistence is for most
series due to fluctuations in common macroeconomic factors. In fact, while the average persistence
of the common components reaches 0.91, the individual components display on average almost no
persistence. There is however considerable heterogeneity in the persistence of the sector-specific
component across sectors.
4.1.3

Persistence and volatility

Bils and Klenow (2004) emphasize that, for a particular process for marginal costs, the Calvo model
predicts that a higher degree of price stickiness reduces the impact of exogenous shocks on current
inflation, but that it increases the persistence inflation. Thus everything else equal, in sectors with
high price stickiness, the inflation rate should display a relatively low volatility and a relatively
high persistence. Bils and Klenow (2004) argue that models such as the Calvo model are rejected
by the data as they predict a strong negative correlation across sectors between the frequency of
price adjustment and the persistence in sectoral inflation, while this correlation is positive in their
data covering 123 consumer goods over the period 1995-2000, and only mildly negative in their
longer data set.
While we do not have estimates of the frequency of price adjustment, as in Bils and Klenow
(2004), we can nevertheless compare the correlations of inflation volatility and inflation persistence
across sectors in our data set. We find a weakly negative correlation (-0.08) between volatility and
persistence in the sector-specific component of inflation, as Table 2 indicates. Once we look at the
common component of inflation, however, the persistence and the volatility of inflation are much
more negatively correlated (-0.46). This explains in part why the Calvo model is more successful
13

in describing the volatility and persistence of inflation fluctuations generated by macroeconomic
disturbances, than those generated by sector-specific shocks.

4.2

Eﬀects of macroeconomic shocks and sector-specific shocks

Prices may change for all sorts of reasons, including changes in costs, in productivity, or changes
in demand for goods. While Bils and Klenow (2004) and Klenow and Kryvtsov (2005) provide
very valuable evidence that most prices are changed relatively frequently, and on average by large
amounts, their study does not identify the source of these changes. It is therefore not clear from
these studies whether prices which tend to change frequently and by large amounts – e.g., due to
large and frequent changes in sector specific conditions – also change readily to macroeconomic
shocks. Clarifying this issue is particularly relevant to understand the eﬀects of monetary policy.
If fact, if prices were adjusting rapidly to monetary shocks, monetary policy would have little and
only short-lived eﬀects on economic activity, as in the model of Golosov and Lucas (2003). Our
paper thus complements Bils and Klenow’s (2004) study by documenting how prices respond to
sector-specific shocks and macroeconomic disturbances.
The left panels of Figure 2 report the response of each of the sectoral (log) price level to
an adverse shock to its own sector-specific component. It is the response to a drop in eit by one
standard deviation. These prices respond sharply and very promptly to sector-specific disturbances,
and tend to reach their new equilibrium level shortly after the shock. Inflation rates show thus
no persistence in response to the sector-specific shock. For PCE categories, we report in Figure 3
the responses of the corresponding quantities to an adverse sector-specific shock in consumption.
Similarly to prices, quantities fall once-and-for-all to such a shock. They don’t seem to revert to
the initial value.
To understand better the shocks that underlie sector-specific disturbances, we report in Figure 4
the correlation between the sector-specific component of PCE prices and the corresponding sectorspecific component of PCE quantities. Figure 4 reports the histogram of the correlations over all
sectors. As is clear from the figure, all correlations except for one are negative.11 This suggests that
sector-specific shocks are overwhelmingly supply-type disturbances. This finding is consistent with
11

The positive correlation refers to the category “insurance premiums for user-operated transportation.”

14

Franco and Philippon (2004) which by looking at a large panel of firms find that permanent shocks
to productivity, largely uncorrelated across firms, explain a large fraction of the firms’ dynamics.
While sector-specific shocks tend to shift prices and quantities permanently to a new level, the
responses to macroeconomic disturbances are very diﬀerent. The middle panels of Figure 2 show the
responses of each sectoral price to an innovation (of minus one standard deviation) to its common
component λ0i Ct . We do the same for the PCE quantities in Figure 3. Prices and quantities fall
by a relatively moderate amount in the first couple of months after the shock, but then continue
to fall over the subsequent months. This reveals important sluggishness in the responses of prices
to macroeconomic disturbances, and persistence in inflation rates. This contrasts sharply with the
responses to sector-specific shocks.
Of course, since we don’t identify any structural macroeconomic shock in this exercise, we are
describing the response to a combination of macroeconomic shocks. These figures do not allow
us to exclude the possibility that there exist macroeconomic disturbances which cause a rapid and
permanent change in prices. To address this shortcoming, we identify in the next section a particular
macroeconomic shock, i.e., a monetary policy shock. To get a sense of the kind of macroeconomic
shocks we are considering here, we note that they do have a permanent eﬀect on both prices and
quantities, and that for PCE categories the correlation between the common component of prices
and of the corresponding quantities are widely distributed over the -1 to +1 interval (Figure 4).
This suggests that the disturbances that are common to our large data set involve both supplyand demand-type shocks.
Overall the results of this section suggest that there is a much higher volatility of sectoral
inflation rates than of aggregate inflation rates, and that changes in sector-specific conditions are the
most important determinants of sectoral inflation rates. Fluctuations in the common components,
however, are responsible for a significant fraction of the volatility of sectoral inflation rates, and
generate most of the fluctuations in aggregate inflation. In addition, sectoral prices respond very
diﬀerently to sector-specific shocks and to macroeconomic shocks. While sector-specific shocks
may cause large fluctuations in sectoral inflation, these fluctuations are typically short lived so that
prices tend to move immediately to their new permanent level. Aggregate macroeconomic shocks
instead tend to have more persistent and sluggish eﬀects on a wide range of sectoral inflation rates.

Eﬀects of Monetary Policy Shocks

We now turn to the discussion of the eﬀects of monetary policy shocks on disaggregated prices. One
advantage of studying their responses to monetary shocks is that this can be done with a minimum
amount of identifying restrictions in the FAVAR. To investigate the eﬀects of other macroeconomic
shocks would require arguably more controversial identifying assumptions. Since Bernanke and
Blinder (1992) and Sims (1992), it is common to use VARs to trace out the eﬀects of monetary
policy innovations on macroeconomic variables. VARs are particularly convenient for this as they
merely require the identification of monetary policy shocks, leaving the rest of the macroeconomic
model unrestricted. To maintain enough degrees of freedom, estimated VARs are typically lowdimensional, involving in general no more than six to eight variables.12 The small size of traditional
VARs has however been criticized. In fact estimated monetary policy innovations are likely to be
biased in small-sized VARs to the extent that central banks and the private sector make decisions on
the basis of information not considered in these VARs. A common illustration of this problem is the
“price-puzzle”, i.e., the finding that the price level tends to increase slightly after a contractionary
money policy shock, which contradicts most standard theories (see Sims, 1992). Another problem
with small-sized VARs is that they don’t allow us to understand the eﬀects of monetary policy
shocks on a large number of variables of interest.
Fortunately, as argued in BBE, the FAVAR described above allows us to address both of these
shortcomings of traditional VAR. BBE provide a characterization of the eﬀects of monetary policy
on about twenty macroeconomic variables using estimated factors. In this paper, we focus on the
eﬀects of monetary policy on our large panel of prices.

5.1

Identification of monetary policy shocks

To identify the monetary policy shock, we follow the strategy described in BBE. The assumption is that none of the latent common components of the economy responds within a month to
unanticipated changes in monetary policy. This is the FAVAR extension of the standard recursive identification of monetary policy shock in standard VARs. To implement it in a FAVAR, we
12

Leeper, Sims and Zha (1996), using Bayesian priors consider slightly larger VARs containing up to about 20
variables.

16

need to account for the added diﬃculty that the principal components are not associated with any
particular economic concepts. However, when the number of data series N is large, the principal
components estimated from the entire data set, Ĉ(Ft , Rt ), have the property that they should consistently recover K + 1 independent, but arbitrary, linear combinations of the latent factors Ft and
the observed common factor, i.e., the Federal funds rate Rt . Since Rt is not explicitly imposed as
a common component in the first step, any of the linear combinations underlying Ĉ(Ft , Rt ) could
involve the Fed’s policy instrument, Rt . It would thus not be valid to simply estimate a VAR
in Ĉ(Ft , Rt ) and Rt , and identify the policy shock recursively. Instead, the direct dependence of
Ĉ(Ft , Rt ) on Rt must first be removed, which is achieved by exploiting a subset of the variables
– prices and real-activity measures, but not financial variables – that are assumed not to respond within the month to changes in monetary policy. We refer readers to BBE for details on the
implementation of the identification.

5.2

Responses to monetary policy shocks

We proceed with a description of the response of our data series to a monetary policy shocks, i.e.,
an unexpected increase (of one standard deviation) of the Federal funds rate. Figure 5a shows the
response of the Federal funds rate, the index of industrial production – as an aggregate measure
of economic activity –, and an aggregate price index (PCE deflator). The solid line shows the
responses generated by our FAVAR and the dashed lines show the responses obtained from a
standard VAR that include these three variables only.13 Figure 5b shows similar impulse responses
except that the VAR is estimated using the consumer price index (CPI) instead of the PCE deflator.
One important feature of this figure is that the responses of the price index and industrial
production are very diﬀerent for the FAVAR and the VAR. The VAR displays a price puzzle and
a large eﬀect of monetary policy on industrial production after four years, which is inconsistent
with long-run money neutrality. The price puzzle is especially important for the VAR using the
CPI data, in Figure 5b. Instead the FAVAR displays a more conventional response of industrial
production, and essentially no response of the price index for the first few months following a
monetary policy shock. As discussed in BBE, since the FAVAR nests the VAR specification, this
13

The VAR includes 13 lags as is the case for the estimated equation (1) in the FAVAR.

17

suggests that the FAVAR is able to exploit the relevant information from the data set, that Sims
(1992) argued may be missing from small-sized VARs. Note that if the additional series added to
the data set were irrelevant, they should not bias the estimated response, but they should rather
result in less precise estimates. As a result, the fact that the responses of the price index and the
industrial production are diﬀerent for both specifications suggests that the FAVAR is exploiting
relevant information, especially for the CPI data, in Figure 5b.
We now turn to the responses of more disaggregated price series to the monetary policy shock.
The FAVAR is perfectly suited for such an exercise as it allows us to compute directly the responses
of all of the variables in the data set. The right panels of Figure 2 contain the disaggregated PCE
and PPI price responses to the same identified monetary policy shock. While we observe some
heterogeneity in the responses, a striking feature is that most indices respond very little for several
months following the shock, and start falling only later. In addition, only very few sectors display
an important price puzzle. Recall that in order to identify the monetary policy shock, we assume
that individual prices do not respond within the same month to changes in the Federal funds rate.
However nothing in the estimated FAVAR constrains the response of price series in all months
following the monetary policy shock.
The right panels of Figure 2 also plot the unweighted average response (thick solid line) and
the response of the overall price index (thick dashed line). It is interesting to note that the average
price responses to a monetary shock and the response of the aggregate price indices are very
similar. This suggests that the weights used in aggregate price indices do not play an important
role in characterizing the response in the overall price indices. The figure makes it clear that most
of the disaggregated prices move little in the 6 months following the monetary shock, and start
decreasing thereafter. As reported in Table 3, the cumulative decline in prices is only 0.09% over
the first 6 months, but reaches 0.43% when cumulated over the first 12 months. The drop in prices
is more pronounced for producer prices with a cumulated decline of 0.78% over the first year than
for consumer prices (cumulated decline of 0.15%). Among consumer prices, the prices of durable
goods start falling more rapidly than nondurables and services, a fact noted by Erceg and Levin
(2002) and Barsky, House and Kimball (2003), and attributed to the greater interest-rate sensitivity
of durable goods. These price indices do not reveal a price puzzle.
18

Overall, when they start falling following the monetary shock, prices tend to decline fairly
steadily for a couple of years. This results in relatively persistent sectoral inflation movements. As
reported in Table 3, the autocorrelation coeﬃcients of inflation conditional on a monetary shock
are all very high.
The right panel of Figure 3 represents the impulse responses of the PCE quantities to the same
monetary policy shock. While on average the real consumption responses tend to fall subsequent
to the monetary shock, before reverting back to the initial level, there is considerable variation
across sectors. As for the price responses, the average real consumption responses displays some
persistence. Interestingly, sectors in which prices fall the most following a monetary shock tend
to be sectors in which quantities fall the least, as indicated in Figure 6. This figure displays
the scatter plot across PCE categories of the cumulated responses of prices and quantities for six
months following the monetary shock, and the regression line reveals a significant and negative
slope. Similar pictures are obtained for longer horizons.
To the extent that one is interested in characterizing the behavior of the economy in response to
monetary policy actions, our results provide empirical support for features such as price rigidities
and inflation persistence often embedded in monetary models. Our findings, however, contrast
sharply with those of Bils, Klenow, and Kryvtsov (2003) and Balke and Wynne (2003) which call
for a rejection of conventional sticky-price models. These authors found the opposite conclusion
mainly because they estimate an important price puzzle.
Bils, Klenow, and Kryvtsov (2003) estimate responses of 123 components of the CPI to a Federal
funds innovation, where the latter innovations are extracted from a 7-variable monthly VAR. As
the VAR is estimated independently from the disaggregated price data, the responses obtained
constitute only rough estimates of the price responses. Based on frequencies of price adjustments
reported in Bils and Klenow (2004), they consider two categories of price responses – the flexible
price and sticky price categories – and they report the responses of the prices in both categories
as well as their ratio. They argue that the movements in relative prices are inconsistent with a
popular sticky-price model. Following an expansionary monetary policy shock, their estimated
relative price (of flexible prices relative to sticky prices) declines initially and then increases, while
in the model, the relative price increases temporarily before reverting back to zero. However, the
19

main reason for their finding of an unconventional relative price response in the data is related to
the fact that their estimate of flexible-price responses display a price puzzle: the flexible prices fall
initially in response a monetary policy expansion, and increase only later. In contrast, sticky prices
do not show significant dynamics in the first 20 months.
Balke and Wynne (2003), instead, focus on components of the producer price index. After
estimating a small-sized VAR and the response of components of the PPI to an identified monetary
policy shock, they also find a substantial price puzzle in individual series, and thus conclude similarly
to Bils, Klenow and Kryvtsov (2003) that the implied estimated evolution of relative prices in
inconsistent with that predicted by sticky price models.
These studies make two key assumptions about the behavior of the macro-economy: i) that the
macroeconomic dynamics can be properly uncovered from a small set of macroeconomic indicators,
and ii) that macroeconomic dynamics can be modeled separately from the disaggregated prices.
Based on the results of BBE, and as argued above, the first assumption does not seem to be
empirically valid and could be responsible for finding a price puzzle. The second assumption implies
that disaggregated prices only have an eﬀect on the macroeconomy through an observed aggregate
index. The FAVAR framework that we consider in this paper relaxes these two assumptions as it
allows us to incorporate more information in the estimation of the macroeconomic dynamics, and
to model the disaggregated dynamics in a more flexible fashion. Interestingly, in contrast to these
studies, we don’t find any evidence of price puzzle in our estimated FAVAR. This implies that the
ratio of flexible to sticky prices behaves as predicted by standard monetary models (including sticky
price models) with flexible prices falling after a contractionary monetary policy shock.

5.3

Cross-sectional variation in price responses

Having estimated impulse responses of sectoral prices to monetary policy shocks, we now attempt
to explain diﬀerences in prices responses with sectoral characteristics.
5.3.1

Cumulated impulse responses and volatility of sectoral shocks

One first set of interesting correlations pertains to the cumulative sum of the impulse responses to a
monetary shocks over the first 6 months (sum6 ) and over the first 12 months (sum12 ). Two striking
20

results are the strongly negative correlations of the cumulative sums (in the last two columns of
Table 2) with the volatility (Sd(ei)) and persistence of idiosyncratic shocks (rho(ei)). To interpret
these correlations, we should point out that the sums of impulse responses are calculated for a
contractionary monetary policy and therefore more negative numbers imply more price flexibility,
i.e. faster price adjustment.
As illustrated further in Figure 7, in sectors with small enough sectoral shocks there is almost
no price response to monetary shocks over the first 6 months. However the larger the sectorspecific volatility the higher the price responses to monetary policy shocks. This result confirms
the interpretation of Figure 1, that industries with high inherent volatility adjust also faster to
macroeconomic disturbances. Similar pictures are found for when we consider longer horizons.
Such a finding appears consistent with the prediction of the state-dependent model of Gertler and
Leahy (2006). In this model, firms are aﬀected by idiosyncratic shocks and face a cost of adjusting
prices. The model predicts that the more firms are aﬀected by idiosyncratic shocks, the more they
adjust prices conditional on a monetary policy shock. Alternatively, by referring to the costs of
processing information, Reis (2006) presents a model of inattentive producers in which a higher
volatility of shocks requires more frequent price updating.
In addition, we note that from Tables 2a-2c that the persistence of the idiosyncratic shocks is
again negatively related to the responses of prices to monetary policy shocks. One possible interpretation is that in industries where we observe more persistence of the idiosyncratic component,
firms adjust immediately to any shock because both common and idiosyncratic components are
persistent. Those firms that experience rather transient idiosyncratic shocks wait to see if the current shock is persistent (macroeconomic) or not (idiosyncratic) and adjust only with a delay. Of
course, these are raw correlations and it is not clear whether any of these relationships will remain
significant after controlling for example for the degree of competition in the industry. Accordingly,
we turn now to regression analysis.
5.3.2

Responses of producer prices and industry characteristics

For the producer price series we have collected data on industry characteristics by NAICS codes.
We can match now the responses of prices to these characteristics. Our goal is to provide evidence
21

on the main explanatory factors for the dispersion in price responses observed in the right panels
of Figure 2. To address this question we start with the following specification of the cross-industry
price responses:
IRF CUi,h = α + β 1 compi + β 2 Sd(e)i + β 3 rho(e)i +

i

(4)

where IRF CUi,h is the cumulative deviation of the price level in industry i after a monetary policy
shock, h periods after the shock. We present results for the deviation of prices 6 and 12 months
after the shock. compi denotes the degree of competition. We also use two variables from the
factor analysis: Sd(e)i is a measure of the volatility of the idiosyncratic component and rho(e)i
is the persistence of this component. To check robustness we will also add other controls and
deterministic components like dummy variables.
We start in Table 6 by using as a dependent variable the cumulative sum of price responses over
the first six months. Column (1) reports that profit rates are strongly and positively correlated
with price responses. Since our price variable is on average negative and higher flexibility implies
more negative cumulative deviation, the result implies that more competitive industries (lower
profit rates) have higher price flexibility. The mean profit rate is about 25% and a movement from
the mean to a profit rate of 35% implies 0.15 percentage points smaller cumulated price change
6 months following a policy shock. This is consistent with standard sticky price models (see e.g.,
Woodford, 2003), as well as with theories based on rational inattention (Reis, 2006). In column (5),
we include three dummy variables to control for potentially diﬀerent average price dynamics. We use
three broad categories — food and textiles (NAICS codes starting with 31; dummy is coded as d1 );
paper, wood, chemicals (codes with 32; dummy is denoted by d2 ); and metallurgy, electronics and
machinery (codes with 33; dummy is denoted by d3 ). In all three cases the intercepts are negative
signifying the absence on average of a price puzzle. Notably the extra flexibility of the model
improves the fit, but does not alter the coeﬃcient on profit rates. In column (6), by including an
interaction term we test whether the relationship between market power and price flexibility diﬀers
across major industry categories, but we find little evidence of changes across major categories.
This positive relationship between price stickiness and competition within each sector contrasts
with Bils and Klenow’s finding (2004) that their preferred measure of market power – the C4 ratio

22

– becomes insignificant once they control for prices of raw material goods. As in Bils and Klenow,
we also find that the C4 ratio is not a robust predictor of price dynamics. We use the inverse of the
ratio as a measure of elasticity of demand, and we report in column (2) that the inverse of the C4
ratio is not significantly related to price dynamics. However, our results based on mean profit rates
imply that for producer prices, market power is robustly related to price dynamics in response to
monetary shocks.
Columns (3) and (4) confirm the correlation from the correlation matrix — both idiosyncratic
volatility and persistence are negatively related to price impulse responses. This implies that firms
in industries with persistent and volatile idiosyncratic shocks adjust rapidly to changes in the
macroeconomic environment. Interestingly, the result survives once we include as controls profit
rates (column (7)) and the three dummy variables defined above (not shown in this table).
As a robustness check, we turn now to the results based on the cumulative response over the first
12 months. The results reported in Table 5 confirm the importance of market power as measured
by profit rates and also confirm the importance of the volatility of the idiosyncratic shocks (Sd (ei))
and its persistence measure (rho (e)i ). As before, the C4 is insignificant. Finally, in Table 6 we
report regressions results for the price impulse responses from the 7th to the 12th month after
the shock, and find again similar results. In column (8) we include also the sum of the impulse
responses in the initial 6 months. The coeﬃcient is highly significant and positive indicating that
a larger portion of the price adjustment occurs in this second 6-month period.
To sum up, our sectoral analysis indicates that as predicted by models based on monopolistic
competition, prices adjust more sluggishly in industries in which market power is higher. In addition
we uncovered two other important determinants of price responses: idiosyncratic volatility and the
persistence of industry-specific shocks.

Robustness Results

All of the results reported above are based on a sample that starts in 1976:1 and ends in 2005:6.
Recent research has however provided evidence of widespread instability in many macroeconomic

23

series14 , of changes in monetary policy behavior15 over our sample, and of an important reduction
in output volatility since around 1984. To ensure that our results are not aﬀected by such events,
we reproduce our main results for the sample 1984:1 — 2005:6.
Table 7 reproduces Table 1 for the post-1984 sample. While the persistence in inflation is lower in
that sample – with the decline in persistence due to a lower persistence in the common component
– all of the qualitative results discussed in Section 4 remain valid. Most notably, it remains true
that most of the volatility in sectoral inflation is explained by sector-specific disturbances. In fact,
only about 10% of inflation fluctuations is attributable to macroeconomic factors. Even though the
persistence in disaggregate inflation is lower in the post-1984 sample than in our full sample, that
persistence remains due to macroeconomic factors.
Figure 8 reproduce the responses of disaggregated prices to sector-specific shocks, to macroeconomic shocks, and to monetary policy shocks. Once again, while there are some changes, the
responses are qualitatively similar to the ones reported for the full sample in Figure 2. Importantly,
the price responses to idiosyncratic shocks are very diﬀerent from those to macroeconomic shocks,
and disaggregated prices continue to respond with a significant delay to monetary policy shocks.

7

Conclusion

In this paper, we disentangle the fluctuations in disaggregated U.S. consumer and producer prices
which are due to aggregate macroeconomic shocks from those due to shocks to individual price series.
We do so by estimating a factor-augmented VAR that relates a large panel of economic indicators
and of individual price series to a relatively small number of estimated common factors. After
identifying monetary policy shocks using all of the information available, we estimate consistently
the eﬀects of U.S. monetary policy on disaggregated prices. This is important not only to get a
better understanding of the nature of the fluctuations in disaggregated prices, and of how prices
react to macroeconomic shocks, but also to assess the impact of monetary policy on prices in various
sectors.
14

Stock and Watson (1996), Boivin (1999), Stock and Watson (2002) have provided evidence of instability in VARs.
Bernanke and Mihov (1998), Clarida, Galí and Gertler (2000), Cogley and Sargent (2001, 2005), Boivin (1999,
2006), Boivin and Giannoni (2002, 2006).
15

24

We obtain several empirical results that can be summarized as follows:
1. At the level of disaggregation considered, most of the sectoral prices fluctuations appear to
be due to sector-specific factors, and only about 15% of individual sectoral price fluctuations,
on average, are due to aggregate macroeconomic factors.
2. Sectoral inflation fluctuations are relatively persistent, but this persistence is essentially due
to the very high degree of persistence in the components driven by common or macroeconomic
shocks, and not to sector-specific disturbances.
3. Sectoral prices respond very diﬀerently to sector-specific shocks and to macroeconomic shocks:
while sector-specific shocks may cause large fluctuations in sectoral inflation, these fluctuations are typically short lived so that prices tend to move immediately to their new permanent
level; aggregate macroeconomic shocks instead tend to have more persistent and sluggish effects on a wide range of sectoral inflation rates.
4. Most disaggregated prices respond with a significant delay to identified monetary policy
shocks, and show little evidence of a “price puzzle,” contrary to existing studies based on
traditional VARs. The absence of a strong price puzzle suggests that by exploiting a large
information set in the estimation of a FAVAR, we may obtain more accurate estimates of the
eﬀects of monetary policy.
5. PCE categories in which prices fall the most following a monetary policy shock tend to be
those in which quantities consumed fall the least.
6. The observed dispersion in the reaction of producer prices to monetary policy shocks is
relatively well explained by the degree of market power.
7. Prices react more rapidly to monetary policy shocks in sectors with volatile idiosyncratic and
persistent idiosyncratic shocks.
8. The correlations between the idiosyncratic components of prices and quantities tend to be
negative, suggesting that sector-specific shocks are mostly supply-type shocks.

25

This collection of stylized facts on the response of disaggregated U.S. prices to various shocks
presents challenges to current models of price determination. An evaluation of various models on
the basis of these stylized facts is beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, it is worth pointing
out that our finding number 3 – namely that sectoral prices respond diﬀerently to macroeconomic
and sector-specific shocks – may explain why sticky-price models such as the Calvo model have
been so popular in characterizing the eﬀects of monetary policy actions on aggregate variables,
while they have been sharply criticized at the same time by authors focused on disaggregate price
series.
Clearly, is would be desirable to have models that can fully account for the responses of aggregate and disaggregated prices to both macroeconomic and sector-specific disturbances. Some
recent papers are very promising in this respect. Carvalho (2006) generalizes the Calvo model to
allow for heterogeneity in price stickiness across sectors. He finds that in the presence of strategic
complementarities, firms which adjust prices infrequently have a disproportionately large eﬀect on
the decisions of other firms, and thus on the aggregate price level. Even if most sectors have relatively flexible prices, and thus respond quickly to sector-specific disturbances, they may respond
sluggishly to nominal shocks. Gertler and Leahy (2006) propose a state-dependent pricing model
that involves volatile prices due to idiosyncratic shocks, but that predicts sluggish price responses
to a monetary shock, as reported here, due to real rigidities.16 The model also predicts that a high
volatility of idiosyncratic shocks should be associated with more volatile prices and a more volatile
response to monetary shocks, as we find in the data. In yet another direction, recent models on
rational inattention such as those proposed by Reis (2006) and Maćkowiak and Wiederholt (2006)
are also able to generate diﬀerent responses of sectoral prices to sector-specific shocks and aggregate
shocks. The model of Reis (2006), for instance predicts that (i) stickiness is higher in industries
with low price elasticity of demand; (ii) costs of processing information are positively related with
inattentiveness; (iii) volatility of shocks requires more frequent updating.
Assessing the empirical success of each of these theories along the many dimensions documented
16

In contrast, the state-dependent model of Golosov and Lucas (2003) which has idiosyncratic productivity shocks
but which abstracts from strategic complementarities generates rapid and strong price responses following a monetary
policy shock. Midrigan (2006), however, extends the model of Golosov and Lucas (2003) to a multi-product setting
and calibrates the distribution of idiosyncratic shocks in a way that mitigates the price responses to monetary shocks.

26

in this paper is not a trivial task. Even though a strict and literal interpretation of any of these
models may always be rejected on some dimension, a fair assessment requires moving beyond the
strict interpretation and determining whether some enriched version of existing theories can be
successful. This is in our view an important avenue for future research.
