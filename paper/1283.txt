The Specification and Influence of Asset Markets
ABSTRACT

This

paper is a chapter in the forthcoming Handbook of International

Economics. It surveys the literature on the specification of models of
asset

markets

and

the

implications of differences in specification for

the macroeconomic adjustment process. Builders of portfolio balance

models have generally employed tpostulated asset demand functions, rather

than deriving these directly from micro foundations. The first major section

of the paper lays out a postulated general specification of asset

and summarizes the fundamental short—run results of portfolio

markets

balance models using a very basic specification of
rudimentary

asset markets. Then,

specifications of a balance of payments equation and goods

market equilibrium conditions are supplied, so that the dynamic distribution

effects of the trade account

under static and rational expectations

with both fixed goods prices and flexible goods prices can be analyzed.
The second major section of the paper

surveys and analyzes micro

foundation models of asset demands using stochastic calculus. The micro—
economic theory of asset demands implies some but not all of the properties of the basic specification of postulated asset demands at the macro

level. Since the conclusions of macroeconomic analysis depend crucially
on the form of asset demand functions, it is important to continue to explore the implications

1. Introduction
This chapter is a discussion of two complementary approaches to the

analysis of asset markets in open economies)—" Section 2 is devoted to
portfolio balance models with postulated asset demands, asset demands
broadly consistent with but not directly implied by microeconomic theory.

Some implications of the microeconomic theory of portfolio selection for

asset demands are spelled out in Section 3. Section 4 contains some
conclusions.

2. Portfolio balance models with postulated asset demands

2.1. Overview
During the last fifteen years there has been a thorough reworking of
macroeconomic theory for open economies using a portfolio balance
approach..?-" According to this approach, equilibrium in financial markets

occurs when the available stocks of national moneys and other financial
assets are equal to the stock demands for these assets based on current

wealth, and wealth accumulation continues only until current wealth is
equal to desired wealth.
In this section we review some of the important results that have

been obtained using portfolio balance models. Although these models were
originally developed to study movements of financial capital, variations

—2—

in interest rates, and changes in stocks of international reserves under

fixed exchange rates, they were quickly adapted to study movements of
financial capital ,

variations

in interest rates, and changes in the

exchange rate under flexible exchange rates. Our discussion reflects the
emphasis placed on the case of flexible exchange rates in more recent
applications of portfolio balance models.

The builders of portfolio balance models have employed postulate&
asset demand functions. By proceeding in this way, they have not denied
the desirability of deriving asset demands from explicit utility

maximizing behavior. Indeed, they have attempted to establish the
plausibility of their asset demands by appealing to microeconomic

theory--in the case of non-monetary assets to the theory of portfolio
selection and in the case of monetary assets to the theory of money

demand. There is widespread agreement on the importance of exploring the
implications of macroeconomic asset demand functions derived from

explicit utility maximizing behavior. A new sense of urgency has been
added by the argument that, iii general, utility maximizing behavior

leads to modifications in asset demands when the policy regime

changes.-1 While this exploration proceeds, results derived using
postulated asset demands can best be regarded as suggestive hypotheses to
be subjected to close scrutiny using asset demand functions with firmer
microeconomic foundations.
After laying out a general specification of asset markets
(subsection 2.2), we summarize the fundamental short—run results of
portfolio balance models using a very basic specification of asset

markets (subsection 2.3). Then, we supply rudimentary specifications of
a balance of payments equation and goods market equilibrium conditions

(h) is the constant weight of the price of the home good in the price

in each

home (foreign) asset demand function is home (foreign) wealth measured
in home currency.

The signs of the responses of asset demands to changes in the

variables on which they depend are indicated by the signs over those

variables. The signs over the nominal rates of return reflect the
assumption that residents of both countries regard all the assets they

hold as strict gross substitutes. The signs over nominal incomes and
price indices reflect the assumption that residents of both countries

hold both moneys for transactions purposes. The signs over nominal
wealths reflect the assumption that all assets are "normal" assets.

In

the special case considered below some variables do not affect some asset
demands.

Equations (2.2) imply that the asset demand functions of equations
(2.4) are subject to familiar restrictions:

that all asset demands must be homogenous of degree one in all variables

(2.7c)

(2.7d)

Only three of the four asset market equilibrium conditions are

independent. Equations (2.3) together with equations (2.1) imply that
world wealth measured in home currency is equal to the sum of the stocks

of all financial assets available for private agents to hold. Equations
(2.2) imply that the sum of all asset demands is identically equal to

world wealth. Thus, the sum of all the excess demands given by equations
(2.4) is identically equal to zero.

In the algebraic analysis below

attention is focused on the markets for home money, foreign money, and
home securities.

2.3. The basic asset market specification
Many of the results that have been derived from portfolio balance
models with postulated asset demands can be illustrated using a basic

—'-

asset mark t specification. The basic specification is obtained from the
general specification by imposing five simplifying assumptions. First,
residents of neither country hold the other country's money that is,
there is no "currency substitution" (M = N =
k =

l,....,7;

m2 = b2 =

f2

=

0;

=

m =

n

=

rnk

= 0).11

=

=

k

=

Second, in each

country residents' demand for money is independent of the return on the
security denominated in the other country's currency (m4 = n3 =

0).

Third, in each country all changes in residents' demand for money
resulting from changes in their nominal income and the price of their

consumption bundle are matched by changes in their demand for the
security denominated in their country's currency (b5 =
=

- n5,

and f6 =

- n6).

- m5,

b6 =

- m6,

Fourth, in each country residents' demand for

money is independent of nominal wealth (m7 =

= 0).

Fifth, in each

country residents' demand for money is unit elastic with respect to their
nominal income (m =

m5PX,

n =

n5EPY).

The first and second assumptions imply that in each country the
responsivenesses of residents' demands for the two securities to changes

in the return on the security denominated in the other country's currency
are equal and opposite in sign (f4 =

- b4

and

= — b3).

The first and

third assumptions imply that in each country residents' demand for the
security denominated in the other country's currency is independent of
their nominal income and the price of their consumption bundle
=

=

=

= 0).

The third and fourth assumptions taken together

with the homogeneity assumption embodied in equations (2.7) imply that
the fraction of any increase in wealth allocated by residents of each
country to securities denominated in their country's currency is equal to
the ratio of their total holdings of assets denominated in their

-8--

=

country's currency to their wealth lb7 = (M + B)/W and

(+

That is, in each country the sum of residents' demands for assets
denominated in a given currency is homogeneous of degree one in nominal

wealth. The third, fourth, and fifth assumptions taken together with the
homogeneity assumption embodied in equations (2.7) imply that in each

country residents' demands for money and securities denominated in their
country's currency are independent of the price of their consumption
bundle (m6 =

b6 = n6

= 0).

equations (2.1) become equations (2.8):

modifications are made in equations (2.2), (2.3), (2.6), and

(2.7).

The impact effects of asset exchanges under static expectations
(c

= 0)

are of some interest in themselves.' In any case the analysis

of impact effects with expected depreciation exogenous is one step in a

complete analysis under rational expectations (e

= E/E).

An initial asset market equilibrium is represented by the

intersection of %%,

schedule were steeper, there would he excess supply of all four assets in
the region to the northwest of a0 between the

and 0P0schedules.

However, it has been established above that the sum of the excess demands
for all four assets must be zero.

Depreciation of the home currency shifts both the
schedules down without affecting the

and

and 11 schedules. It raises not

only the home currency value of wealth in both countries but also the

home currency value of the supply of foreign securities. Thus, it
creates excess demand for home securities and excess supply of foreign

securities.!! A drop in i cuts (boosts) the demand for home (foreign)
securities.

First consider an expansionary open market operation in the home
country (dpi =

0).

With the exchange rate fixed the fW and
and

schedules shift down to

The shift in the

schedule

is

smaller; a reduction in the home interest rate not only reduces home
residents' demand for home securities by more than it increases their

demand for money because it simultaneously increases their demand for
foreign securities but also reduces foreign residents' demand for home

securities. The new equilibrium is at a1 where i is lower and i is

unchanged. Depreciation of the home currency shifts the

Intervention of Type III is an exchange of home currency securities

for foreign currency securities (d = - d1? >

0).

Since this type of

intervention leaves both money supplies unchanged, it has been called
sterilized intervention. It shifts II and 1?? to B2B? and ?l.1? .

The new

equilibrium is at a0 where i and i are unchanged. flepreciation of the
home currency shifts

and 1?1? down until they pass through
a0.

An exogenous increase in P operates exactly like an open market sale
by the home authorities since it raises the excess demand for home money
and lowers the excess demand for home securities by amounts that are

equal in absolute value. Thus it causes i to rise and the home currency

to

*

*

appreciate. By analogy an exogenous increase in P causes i to rise

and the home currency to depreciate.
We assume that there is 'local asset preference:° home residents

allocate a larger fraction of any increase in wealth to home securities
than foreign residents (b7 >

b7).

With local asset preference, a

transfer of wealth from home residents to foreign residents (dw < 0) has
effects

which are identical to those of a sterilized intervention

operation.

It lowers the excess demand for home securities and

raises

the excess demand for foreign securities by amounts that are equal in
absolute value.

The impact effects of the home authorities' policy instruments on

two possible target variables are highlighted in Figure 2. The home

authorities have two independent policy instruments, open market

operations and intervention operations of Type II, which they can use to
achieve desired values for two target variables, the home money supply

and the exchange rate, given a constant foreign money supply. Movements
out the horizontal axis represent contractionary open market operations,

increases in the stock of home securities () matched by decreases in the
home money supply. Movements up the vertical axis represent
contractionary intervention operations of Type II, increases in the stock

of foreign securities () matched by decreases in the home money supply.
The M0M0 schedule shows the pairs of

and

that are compatible with a

constant value of the home money supply. If currency units are defined
so that the exchange rate varies in the neighborhood of unity, then the

schedule has a slope of minus one. Under the basic specification,
both interest rates are constant along the itf schedule because there is a

one to one correspondence between the money supply and the interest rate

in each country. The

that

schedule must be

flatter than the MM schedule since an intervention operation of Type II
has a greater effect on the exchange rate than an open market operation

of equal size as shown above for the basic specification. It follows
that movements down along the

schedule lead to decreases in the home

money supply and increases in the home interest rate. The home
authorities can expand the home money supply from the level corresponding

As groundwork for the dynamic analysis below it is useful to provide

an algebraic derivation of the results just arrived at graphically. We
first select a state variable for the system and then express the asset

market equilibrium conditions in terms of deviations of the variables
from their stationary equilibrium values.

2.4. The specification of the goods markets and the balance of payments
Even when the objective is to study the behavior of interest rates
and the exchange rate at a point in time, it is not possible to conduct

the analysis using just the asset market equilibrium conditions except
under very restrictive assumptions.

It was shown in the last section

that if goods prices are fixed and expectations are static, then the

=

0.

-18-

conditions for asset market equilibrium are sufficient to determine

interest rates and the exchange rate at a point in time. However, if
goods prices are fixed and expectations are rational, then a balance of
payments condition must be employed together with the asset market

equilibrium conditions to jointly determine interest rates, the exchange
rate, the percentage rate of change in the exchange rate, and the rate of

transfer of wealth between home and foreign residents. Moreover, if
goods prices are flexible, then under both static and rational

expectations a complete model must include goods market equilibrium

conditions. Of course, when the objective is to study the behavior of
interest rates and the exchange rate over time, a balance of payments

condition must be employed no matter whether expectations are static or
rational

In this subsection we specify equilibrium conditions for the home

and foreign goods markets and a balance of payments equation. Since the
focus of this chapter is asset markets, we have deliberately kept the
specification of the goods market equilibrium conditions and the balance
of payments equation as simple as possible.--1

Below we consider two special cases of the goods market

equilibrium conditions and the balance of payments equation. In both
special cases real outputs in both countries are assumed to always be at

their "full employment" or "natural" levels. In the first special case
it is assumed that balanced budget fiscal policy is used in each country
*
to fix the price of output in that country (dp = dp = 0). Furthermore,
in each country the demand for the good produced in the other cOuntry is
assumed to be independent of the level of nominal spending

Assumptions imposed above imply that

(, C3, C5 and C6 are positive. We

assume that responsivenesses of saving to wealth are the same in the two
countries Cs2 =

so that transfers of wealth between
countries affect

the distribution but not the level of world saving. Under this

assumption C2 and C4 are positive. Since our assumptions imply that all
the coefficients in equations (2.22)

are positive, the signs preceding

the coefficients indicate the signs of the effects of changes in the
variables
The

relationships summarized by equations (2.22) are in accord with

intuition. First,. consider a transfer of wealth from foreign residents
to home residents (dw >

For example, an increase in P reduces

excess demand for home goods both by

increasing savings and by reducing

the home trade surplus; however, it increases excess demand for the
foreign good only by increasing the foreign trade surplus which, of
course, is the negative of the home trade surplus.
Therefore, the
*
transfer causes P to rise and P to fall. The direct
effect of the
transfer on the home trade surplus is to reduce it since foreigners

-25-

spend less on home goods and

home residents spend more on foreign goods.

The indirect effect resulting from the induced price changes reinforces
the direct effect)-"
Now consider a depreciation of the home currency (de >

Given

the

depreciation increases demand for home goods and decreases demand for

foreign goods. A given percentage increase

goods that is smaller in

and an effect on the excess demand for foreign

For example, if equation (2.17a) is

divided by P. then E and P

always enter as the ratio of E to P except in the terms for home and
foreign real wealth measured in home goods.

Equiproportionate changes in

E and P lower real wealth. Similarly, a given

and an effect on excess demand for home goods

that is smaller in alsolute value than the effect of the same percentage

depreciation (I <

Therefore the depreciation causes p to

rise and p to fall.

A depreciation of the home currency increases the home trade
surplus if there is local asset preference [b7

as shown in equation (2.22c). Some

intuition about this result can be

gained by considering two special cases.

Assume temporarily that there

is no local asset preference [(M + B)/W

Following a depreciation

[(W + EW)/P] constant and let P fall by enough to keep world wealth

measured in foreign goods [(W + EW)/EP]
constant. Then the relative
*
price of the foreign good (EP/P) remains constant, and there is no change
in excess demand for either good or in the home trade surplus. Now
assume again that there is local asset preference and assume temporarily
that there is no local good preference (x2 =

2'

=

In this case

the changes in P and P considered above lower home real wealth measured
in both goods and raise foreign real wealth measured in both goods.
However, the goods markets remain in equilibrium since the redistribution
of real wealth does not affect the excess demands for goods. Thus, there
is no need for a change in the relative price of the foreign good and no
*

need for further changes in P and P. The home trade
surplus increases
since foreign spending on home goods increases and home spending on

foreign goods falls. According to equation (2.22c), the result that a
depreciation increases the trade surplus when there is local asset
preference is very general :

it is independent of good preference and the

signs of security positions.

2.5. A distribution effect of a trade surplus with goods prices fixed
If asset demands embody local asset preference, a transfer of
wealth to home residents through a trade account surplus raises the
demand for home securities and lowers the demand for foreign securities.
In this subsection we spell out the implications of this distribution
effect of a trade surplus with goods prices fixed. In this special case,
our model is similar to what some have called a "partial equilibrium"

model of exchange rate hehavior)—/

—27-

The first building block of the fixed price model is the balance

of payments equation from the first special case of the goods market
equilibrium conditions and the balance of payments equation.

This

equation is reproduced here for convenience:

(2.20)

w = nde,

Ti =

X4

-

= x4

+ x4 > 0.

The w schedule in the left—hand panel of Figure 3 represents this

relationship. It slopes upward because a depreciation of the home
currency increases the home trade surplus and, therefore, increases home

asset accumulation (w). The long-run equilibrium exchange rate (e0) is
the only value of e for which the trade surplus and, therefore, asset
accumulation equal zero as indicated by the horizontal w = 0 schedule in

the right-hand panel of Figure 3. The horizontal arrows show the
direction of motion of w. When the home currency price of foreign
currency is too high (e > e0), the home country runs a trade surplus and
accumulates assets (w > 0).
The second building block of the fixed price model is the equation
for the expected rate of change of the exchange rate (c)

implied

by asset

market equilibrium in the basic specification of asset markets. Solving
*

equation (2.15c) for c with dp = dp = 0 yields

The As schedule in the right—hand panel of Figure 3 is the asset

market equilibrium schedule under static expectations. It represents the
pairs of e and w that are compatible with asset market equilibrium given

that C is equal to zero. This schedule is downward sloping under the
assumption of local asset preference (b7 — b7 > 0). A transfer of wealth

to home residents raises the demand for home securities, so the home
currency must appreciate to reequilibrate the asset markets if C is to

remain unchanged. The more pronounced is local asset preference, that
is, the greater b7 -

b7, the steeper is As.

The AR schedule is the asset market equilibrium schedule under
rational expectations given that exchange rate expectations are

compatible with the stability of long—run equilibrium. Under rational
expectations the As schedule is simply the schedule along which
C = e =

0.

The vertical arrows show the direction of motion of e.

-30-

Above As there is excess demand for home assets with e = 0, so the home
currency must be expected to depreciate (e > 0) to equilibrate the asset

markets. Long—run equilibrium is a saddle point under rational
expectations as indicated by the arrows.--' Following a disturbance the
world economy will reach long—run equilibrium if and only if it moves
along the unique saddle path represented by AR.

The effects of an unanticipated transfer of wealth from foreign
residents to home residents (w0 >

= ) are

shown in Figure 3. This

disturbance does not shift any of the schedules, tinder static

expectations the home currency appreciates (e05 <

and the home
As w falls, the home

currency depreciates. The economy moves along As back to long-run
equilibrium. Under rational expectations the home currency appreciates
but not as much as under static expectations (e05 <

e0

and the

home country begins to run a trade account deficit but one which is
smaller than under static expectations (WO,S <

0).

Once again, as

w falls, the home currency depreciates. The economy moves along AR back
to long—run equilibrium. When agents take account of the future path of
the exchange rate, the initial movement in this variable is damped.

The effects of an unanticipated contractionary open market

operation are shown in Figure 4. This operation shifts the

As and AR

schedules down to A and A. Under both static and rational expectations
the home currency appreciates, and the home country begins to run a trade

account deficit. In the new long-run equilibrium, home wealth is lower

happens is that the home interest

wealth must decline to reequilibrate that market.

country from foreign to home goods is shown in Figure 5. This
disturbance shifts the w schedule, the w = 0 schedule, and the AR

reequilibrate the current account. With a lower e, w must be higher in
order to reequilibrate the market for home currency securities.

2.6. Distribution effects of the trade surplus with goods prices flexible
If goods prices are flexible, not only local asset preference but

also local good preference is sufficient to insure that a trade account

surplus has a distribution effect. In this subsection we spell out the
implications of the distribution effects of a trade surplus with goods
prices flexible.

The w = 0 schedule in Figure 6 repesents the pairs of e and w for

which w equals zero. If there is local asset preference, it slopes
upward. An increase in w lowers home asset accumulation, so the home
currency must depreciate in order to increase it.

If there is no local

asset preference, the w = 0 schedule is vertical since changes in the

exchange rate do not affect asset accumulation. The horizonal arrows

show the motion of w. Above the w = 0 schedule the home country runs a
trade surplus and accumulates assets.

The second building block of the flexible price model is the
reduced form equation for the expected rate of change of the exchange
rate (c) derived by solving equation (2.15c) for c and eliminating dp and
*

gives the effect of an expansionary open market

operation (dM = — dB > 0) on e.

The As schedule in Figure 6 is the asset market equilibrium

schedule under static expectations. It represents the pairs of e and w
that are compatible with asset market equilibrium given that c is equal

to zero. If there is either local asset preference or local good
preference, the As schedule slopes downward. First consider the effect
of an increase in w.

If there is local asset preference, this increase

in w raises the demand for home securities directly. If there is local
*

good preference, the increase in w raises P and lowers P as shown in
subsection 2.4. The net effect of these induced price changes is to
increase the demand for home securities as shown in subsection 2.3.

Thus, either local asset preference or local good preference is a
sufficient condition for an increase in w to raise the demand for home

securities. Now consider the effect of an appreciation of the home
currency, that is, a decrease in e. This decrease lowers the demand for
*

home securities directly. It also lowers P and raises P as shown in

subsection 2.4. The net effect of these induced price changes is to

-37-

lower the demand for home securities. Thus, a decrease in e
unambiguously lowers the demand for home securities. If there is neither
local asset preference nor local good preference, the A5schedule is
horizontal.

The AR schedule is the asset market equilibrium schedule under
rational expectations given that exchange rate expectations are

compatible with the stability of long-run equilibrium. Under rational
expectations, the As schedule is just the

e

=

0 schedule. The

vertical arrows show the direction of motion of e. Above As there IS
excess demand for home assets with e = 0, so the home currency must be

expected to depreciate. Long-run equilibrium is a saddle point under
rational expectations as indicated by the arrows.-'

AR is the unique

saddle path aTong which the economy must move followng a disturbance in
order to reach long—run equilibrium.

The qualitative effects of a transfer of wealth to home residents
on e and w when there is local asset preference are the same whether or

not there is local good preference. These effects are shown in Figure 6.
This disturbance does not affect either of the schedules. Under both
static and rational expectations the home currency appreciates (e05 <

eOR

<

is),

and the home country begins to run a trade deficit. The

economy moves along either As or AR back to long-run equilibrium.
The qualitative effects of a contractionary open market operation
on e and w when there is local asset preference are also the same whether

or not there is local good preference. These effects are shown in Figure

7. The As and AR schedules are shifted down to A and A. Under both
static and rational expectations the home currency appreciates, and the

-38-

-39-

home country begins to run a trade deficit. In contrast to the results
obtained with goods prices fixed both home wealth and the exchange rate

are lower in the long-run equilibrium. Since asset accumulation now
depends on w as well as e and since w has declined, e need not return all

the way to its initial value in order to raise asset accumulation to
zero.

While the qualitative behavior of the nominal exchange rate is the
same with local asset preference whether or not there is local good

preference, the behavior of the terms of trade or real exchange rate
*

(EP/P) differs in the two cases. We illustrate this result with the case
of a transfer of wealth. At the outset note that for this disturbance
the real exchange rate is unaffected in the new long-run equilibrium.
Then focus attention on the impact effects and the adjustment paths.

First suppose that there is local good preference. It follows from
equations (2.22a) and (2.22b) that an increase in w raises P and lowers
*
P. It also follows from these equations that an appreciation of the
nominal exchange rate causes an appreciation of the real exchange rate:

d(e +

- p)/de

=

(1/)(x22

-

2y2)(b7

-

7)W

>0.

(2.26)

As a result the impact effect of the transfer of wealth must be an

appreciation of the real exchange rate,so the real exchange rate must
depreciate along the adjustment path. Now suppose there is no local good
preference. Increases in w and changes in the nominal exchange rate have
no effect on the real exchange rate, so the real exchange rate remains

unaffected by the transfer of wealth. This is a case of nominal exchange
rate dynamics without real exchange rate dynamics.

-40-

The effects of a wealth transfer and an open market operation on e
and w when there is local good preference hut no local asset preference

are shown in Figures 8 and 9. The only qualitative difference in the
effects on e and w in this case is that the long—run equilibrium value of
w is unchanged by an open market operation because asset accumulation is
independent of the exchange rate.
An interesting special case arises when there is local good
preference but no local asset preference and when open market operations

are employed to peg nominal interest rates in both countries. In this
*
special case movements in P and P do not affect asset market equilibrium.
The effects of a wealth transfer are shown in Figure 10 in which the As

and AR schedules are horizontal. A transfer of wealth has no effect on
the nominal exchange rate. However, it follows from equations (2.22a)
and (2.22b) that it does affect the real exchange rate.

effect

The impact

*

of the transfer is to raise P and lower P. These variables return

to their original values as home residents decumulate wealth. This is a
case of real exchange rate dynamics without nominal exchange rate
dynamics.

The effects of a wealth transfer and an open market operation when

there is neither local asset preference nor local good preference are

shown in Figures 10 and 11. The A and AR schedules are horizontal even
though interest rates are not pegged. There are neither nominal nor real
exchange rate dynamics. A transfer of wealth has no effect on the
exchange rate, but the home country begins to run a trade account

deficit. An open market operation causes the home currency to appreciate
immediately to its new long-run equilibrium value and has no effect on
the trade surplus of the home country.

2.7. Negative net foreign asset positions and stability
A negative net foreign asset position is a net debt of residents of
one country denominated in the currency of the other country
*

(F or B < 0).

Several writers have suggested that negative net foreign

asset positions alone can be a source of dynamic instability.--"
According to an alternative view presented in this subsection, negative
net foreign asset positions are not an independent source of instability.
Instability can arise only under nonrational expectations or because of
destabilizing specul ati on

The exposition is simplified by retaining the assumption of local

**
asset preference [(M + B)/W

> B/W

*

**

and, therefore, (N + F)/W > F/W].

This assumption taken together with our other assumptions implies that
only net foreign asset positions can be negative: net domestic asset

positions are always positive (M + B, N + F >

*

_

0).

W, W, ,

,I=
*

and N = N are all positive. If B and F are positive, B and F may be

*
*
B and N + F
However,
if
there

preference,
M
+
negative.
*
*
must still be positive. If B and F are negative, B and F and, therefore,
M

*
*
+ B and N + F are

positive.

Suppose goods prices are fixed. The w and w = 0 schedules are the
same as those shown in Figure 3 whether or not there are negative net
foreign asset positions because net foreign asset positions do not enter
the balance of payments equation.
In contrast, the slope of the asset market equilibrium schedule

under static expectations (As) may be different when there are negative
net foreign asset positions.

A5 is downward sloping as in Figure 3 in

-46-

the "normal" case.

In this case, a depreciation of the home currency

raises the value of c

required

to clear the asset markets (Ce > 0). As

shown by (2.24), since b7 > t7, an increase in w raises the value of c

required to clear the asset markets (c > 0). Thus, an increase in w
must be matched by an appreciation of the home currency if the asset

markets are to remain in equilibrium. However, the A schedule is upward
sloping as in Figure 12 in the "perverse" case.

In this case, a

depreciation of the home currency lowers the value of e required to clear

the asset markets (Ce < 0). An increase in w must be matched by a
depreciation of the home currency if the asset markets are to remain in
equilibrium.

The restriction required for the normal case (Ce > 0) is always
satisfied if there are no negative net foreign asset positions
*
*
(F, B > 0).
When F and B are positive, a depreciation of the home
currency unambiguously raises the demand for home securities

> 0)

because it raises home and foreign wealth.

the

The restriction required for
*
normal case may be violated if either F or B is negative and is

definitely violated if both are negative. If F is negative, a
depreciation lowers home residents' wealth and, therefore, reduces their
*
demand for home securities. If B is negative, a depreciation raises

foreign residents' wealth. However, their demand for home securities
falls as their wealth rises.

We investigate the stability of long—run equilibrium by analyzing
an unanticipated transfer of wealth from foreign residents to home

residents. Long—run equilibrium is stable under static expectations in
the normal case. The analysis of a wealth transfer in subsection 2.5,

-47-

I

-48-

which is summarized in Figure 3, applies without modification. In the
normal case negative net foreign asset positions do not alter the
qualitative effects of wealth transfers and exchange rate changes on c.

Long—run equilibrium is definitely unstable under static expectations in

the perverse case as shown in Figure 12. The transfer of wealth from
foreign residents to home residents (w0 >

raises

demand for home

securities. In the perverse case, asset market equilibrium is restored

by a depreciation (e05 >

rather

than an appreciation of the home

currency, and the home country begins to run a trade surplus (w05 >

0).

As w rises, the home currency depreciates further. The economy moves

along As away from long—run equilibrium.-'
If speculation is stabilizing, long-run equilibrium is stable under

rational expectations in both the normal and perverse cases.--" As the

points under rational expectations. What is remarkable is that this
result holds not only in the normal case but also in the perverse case.
It is usual to find that if long-run equilibrium is stable under static

expectations, it is a saddle point under rational expectations. However,
here long-run equilibrium is a saddle point under rational expectations
even if it is unstable under static expectations.

under rational expectations the exchange rate jumps to clear the

asset markets, just as it did under static expectations. Following a
transfer, the world economy reaches long-run equilibrium if and only if
it moves along the unique saddle path represented by AR in Figure 3 in

the normal case and by AR in Figure 12 in the perverse case. If the

3. The Microeconomic foundations of asset demands in open economies

3.1. Overview
Demand equations for assets denominated in different currencies
are based on the solution to a maximization problem faced by an

individual investor. One specification of the problem is very common.
The investor consumes a bundle of goods each of which is produced in a
different country and priced in the currency of the country in which it

is produced. In each currency denomination there is a security with a
fixed nominal value and a certain nominal return. The investor has
initial holdings of some or all of the securities and an uncertain

stream of future labor income. Percentage changes in goods prices and
exchange rates are assumed to follow "geometric Brownian motion." This
assumption implies that successive percentage changes in these variables
are

independently distributed no matter how short the time interval and

that the levels of the variables are log normally distributed. The
investor

maximizes the expected value of discounted lifetime utility.

In early analyses of portfolio selection in a closed economy, the

specification of the investor's maximization problem was simplified by

several assumptions.-" First, it was assumed that the portfolio
allocation decision in each period was separable from the saving

decision. Under this assumption the optimal portfolio rule could be
obtained by maximizing the expected utility of return in each period.

Second, no distinction was made between nominal and real returns because

the price level was assumed to be fixed. Third, it was assumed either
that uncertain asset returns were normally distributed or that utility

was quadratic in pártfolio return. Fourth, it was assumed that there

-54-

was an asset with a known return, the "safe" asset. These

assumptions

yielded the classic portfolio separation results.
More recent analyses of portfolio selection and saving in the

closed economy have employed the tools of stochastic calculus.-'

An

implicit solution for a general version of the investor's lifetime
utility maximization problem has been obtained by applying the
"Fundamental Theorem of Stochastic Dynamic Programming" and Ito's Lemma

on stochastic differentials. In this general case the portfolio
allocation problem is not separable from the saving decision and the
classic portfolio separation results do not hold.
Recognizing the implications of some special assumptions in the

more recent continuous time framework provides some perspective on

earlier contributions. The assumption that the investor's instantaneous
utility function exhibits constant relative risk aversion implies that

the portfolio allocation decision is separable from the saving

decision." It is comforting to know that the separability of these
decisions, which was simply assumed in earlier contributions, is implied

by a class of utility functions. The assumption that the percentage
changes in asset prices follow geometric Brownian motion so that the
prices themselves are log normally distributed implies the classic

portfolio separation resu1ts.-' The very similar assumption that
percentage returns are normally distributed yields these separation
results in the earlier analyses.

The investor in the open economy must take account of both

exchange rate and price index uncertainty.-' Although a foreign
security has a certain nominal return denominated in foreign currency,
its nominal return in home currency is uncertain.

Uncertainty about

—55—

real returns arises not only because future values of exchanges rate are
unknown but also because future values of the price index used to

deflate nominal wealth are unknown. Exchange rate and price index
changes are related in general, and the covariance between nominal
returns inclusive of exchange rate changes and price index changes plays

an important role in portfolio choice in an open economy. Changing the
stochastic specification of the price index can have significant effects
on this important covariance.

We begin by laying out a basic model with two assets, a home

security and a foreign security, in subsection 3.2. The implications of
a popular specification of the price index are spelled out in subsection

3.3. In subsection 3.4 we show the effect of imposing relative
purchasing power parity on this popular specification, and in section
3.5 we trace out some consequences of violating the law of one price.
Subsection 3.6 contains a three asset model that is generalized in

subsection 3.7. Finally, in subsection 3.8 we illustrate the
integration of money into the open economy portfolio allocation problem.

The investor's objective

followed by the percentage change in real wealth d/t. In order to find

dW/, we make use of Ito's Lemma. Let H =

The stochastic differential of real wealth dW is derived from the

expression for real wealth (B + EF)/f) in equation (3.4). d is equal to
the conventional first differential of this expression plus one half
times the conventional second differential:

Note that V

is

not explicitly dependent on time, so there is no dt in the

stochastic differential.

Multiplying equation (3.11) by 1/a, taking account of the
relationships in (3.5), and combining terms yields an expression for

d/i:

d/t = (1

The following example shows how the terms in (3.13) follow from Ito's

Lemma. The product of (3.6) and (3.7) is

(dQ/Q)(dE/E) =

lrqcdt2 + lrqaedtdze + qdtdZq + aqaedzqdze.

(3.14)

-60-

The first term on the right hand side is second order of
magnitude,
approximately zero. The product dtdz is zero because dz is white
noise. Therefore, the second and third terms disappear. Since the
variance of a continuous time process is proportional to time, the

standard deviation term dz is of the order of magnitude of the square

root of dt.-1 Therefore, the last term becomes

apedzpdze =

Thus (3.14) reduces to the expression for (dQ/O)(dE/E) in (3.13b).
The final expression for d/iI is obtained by substituting equations (3.3),

subsection 3.4.

(3.23) respectively. In subsection 3.2 we showed that the only parameter

the covariance of this process with the stochastic process for the exchange

rate qe The expression for qe implied by equations (3.21), (3.6), (3.22),
and (3.23) is obtained by applying Ito's Lemma twice.

find dQ/Q. Then, it is employed to evaluate the product (dO/Q)(dE/E):

In section 2 it was shown that the properties of portfolio balance models
with postulated asset demands depend critically on whether there is local

asset preference. It seems clear that there is local asset preference
in most countries. A widely accepted explanation for local asset
preference is that foreigners allocate a larger share of their portfolios
to foreign assets than home residents because they devote a larger share

of their expenditure to foreign goods. Therefore, it is interesting to
ask whether the portfolio rule of equation (3.26) implies a positive
association between the share of wealth devoted to foreign securities x
and the share of expenditure devoted to foreign goods .

The portfolio rule (3.19) can be rewritten in two intuitively

appealing forms whenever the exchange rate and the price index follow

geometric Brownian motion. This rule can be rewritten in a third
intuitively appealing fom in the special case of the popular
specification of the price index in (3.22).

The optimal portfolio rule (3.19) can be viewed as a weighted
average of the minimum variance portfolio rule and the logarithmic or

"international investor's" portfolio rule.'1 The minimum variance
portfolio rule (AM) is obtained by minimizing (3.17) with respect to A:

—66-

AM =

(3.30)

If the investor's utility function is logarithmic [U() =

ln],

then

The logarithmic portfolio rule (XL) is obtained by setting R = 1

in equation (3.26):

AL =

(1/a)( + c - i).

(3.31)

This rule has often been referred to as the international investor's

portfolio rule because it is independent of expenditure shares. The
optimal portfolio rule can be written as a weighted average of AM
and AL:

A =

[(R

-

1)/R](Pqe/)

+

(1/R)[(1/a)( + c - i)].

(3.32)

As the coefficient of relative risk aversion R approaches infinity the

optimal rule approaches the minimum variance rule. As R approaches one
the optimal rule approaches the logarithmic rule. The covariance term

qe

enters only through the minimum variance portfolio, and the return

differential enters only through the logarithmic portfolio.
The optimal portfolio can also be written as the sum of the
minimum

variance portfolio and a zero net worth "speculative"

that

If E, P. and P are stochastic, the minimum

variance shares deviate from the expenditure shares when exchange
rate changes are associated with changes in

goods prices. Substituting

equations (3.35) into equations (3.33) confirms that the optimal
portfolio can be written as the sum of the expenditure share portfolio,
the hedge portfolio, and the speculative portfolio. Of course, the
hedge portfolio and the speculative portfolio could be added together
so that the optimal portfolio could be expressed as the sum of the
expenditure share portfolio and a single zero net worth portfolio.

However, whether this observation confirms the view that the investor

expressions for the optimal portfolio besides (3.42) are consistent with

relative PPP. For example, using the relationships in (3.41) to solve

stochastic process for the third.

'qe unless the coefficient of relative

In their survey of the literature on

—71—

international portfolio diversification, Adler and Dumes (1983) report
that for many countries the covariance between the consumer price index

and the exchange rate is low in monthly data. This finding suggests
that it is worth asking what might cause the covariance to be low.
In exploring for possible causes of a low price index - exchange
rate covariance it is useful to adopt a general specification of the
price index, one in which neither relative PPP nor the law of one price

is imposed. Suppose that the home currency price of foreign goods

is

equal to the product of the exchange rate E, the foreign currency price
of foreign goods, and a variable representing the (proportional)
deviation from the law of one price V:

= EPV.

(3.44)

Then, the price index is given by

0 = P1

-

(EPV)

.

(3.45)

The exchange rate, the price of home goods, and the price of foreign
goods follow the stochastic processes (3.6), (3.22), and (3.23)
respectively, and the deviation from the law of one price follows
geometric Brownian motion:

The expression for qe implied by equations (3.45), (3.6), (3.22),
(3.23), and (3.46) is obtained by applying Ito's Lemma twice, first to

find dQ/Q and then to evaluate (dQ/Q)(dE/E):-i

3.6. Asset demands in a three asset model with exchange rates and the
price Index stochastic
In the two asset model of subsection 3.2 assets are gross

substitutes as they are in all two asset models. However, in models with
three or more assets, the possibility arises that some assets may be

complements. Whether assets are substitutes or complements depends on
the association between the returns on the assets. If the Interest rate
on the first asset rises and the returns on the second and third assets
are highly correlated, the demand for second asset may rise while the
demand for the third asset falls, or vice versa.
In this subsection we spell out the conditions under which assets

are complements in a three asset generalization of the two asset model of

subsection 3.2. The objective function V is given by equation (3.1).
The investor allocates a proportion A1 of his nominal wealth W to the
first

foreign security F1, a proportion A2 to the second foreign security

F2, and the remainder to the home security B:

This rule is analogous to the rule obtained in the two asset model. The
share of wealth devoted to a single foreign security is replaced by a

vector of shares. The inverse of the variance of exchange rate changes
is replaced by the inverse of the varince-covariance matrix of changes in

exchange rates. The single expected nominal return differential is
replaced by the vector of expected nominal return differentials.

The

covariance of the price index with one exchange rate is replaced by a
vector of covariances of the price index with exchange rates.
In equation (3.60) the optimal portfolio shares are expressed as

a weighted average of the shares of the minimum variance portfolio
=

and the logarithmic portfolio

= c11o.

The structure of the

logarithmic and minimum variance portfolios in the three asset model is
analogous to the structure of those portfolios in the two asset example:
return differentials enter only the logarithmic portfolio and covariances

of the price index with exchange rates enter only the minimum variance
portfolio.

The portfolio rule can also be written as the sum of the minimum

(3.63c)

An increase in the nominal return on the first foreign security raises
the demand for that security, as always. The two other assets are
gross substitutes for the first foreign security if both cross partials

are negative, that is, if the correlation between the nominal returns on
the two foreign securities, which is just the correlation between the two
exchange rates, is positive but less than
y2/c,1.

If

the two exchange

rates are positively correlated and have variances that are roughly

equal, the three securities are definitely gross substitutes. Negative
correlation between the two exchange rates implies that the two foreign

securities are complements. Positive correlation and a large enough
value of 11a2 imply that the first foreign security and the home
security are complements. Thus, in a three asset model, making the
assumption that the assets are gross substitutes is equivalent to
imposing restrictions on the correlations between the nominal returns on
assets.

3.7 Asset demands in a general model with exchange rates and the price
index stochastic

which there are N foreign securities and a home security. By analogy the
optimal portfolio rule can be written in two ways:

portfolio. A is the N dimensional column vector of the shares of the N
foreign securities in the optimal portfolio. c is the NxN variance—
covariance matrix for the changes in the N exchange rates, which are

defined as foreign currency prices of the home currency. p is the N
dimensional vector of covariances of the price index with the N exchange

rates. ô is the N dimensional vector of return differentials, n +
n =

1,...,N.

A.M'AL' and

n

-

are all N dimensional vectors. For the rules

A, 2M' and AL' the home security share is one minus the sum of the N
foreign security shares; for the rule

the home security share is the

negative of the sum of the N foreign security shares.

The basic structure of the general model is the same as that of the

two and three asset models. The logarithmic portfolio is not sensitive
to the choice of assumption regarding price index dynamics. However, the
minimum variance portfolio is sensitive to this choice. Different

-80-

assumptions about price index dynamics made by various analysts are
reflected in different p

vectors.

3.8. Integrating money into the microeconomic theory of asset demands
The portfolio rules of subsections 3.2 to 3.7 are rules for
allocating

nominal wealth among interest bearing securities. If the mean

and variance of the change in real wealth are the only arguments in the
objective

function, non interest bearing money is not held in portfolios

because it is dominated by securities denominated in the same currency

that pay a certain nominal return. Money has been integrated into the
microeconomic theory of asset demands by assuming that real money

balances enter the investor's objective function. Some analysts justify
the procedure by arguing that real balances as well as goods are inputs

into a "production function" for consumption, so utility can be expressed

as a function of real balances and goods.-' Others argue that an
investor with higher real balances has more leisure because he need

make fewer trips to the bank.-1 There is a lively debate about whether
it is useful to assume that real balances enter the investor's objective

function. We make no attempt to summarize that debate here.-1 Rather
we report some of the results that have been derived under the assumption
that real balances enter the investor's objective function.
The investor's augmented objective function

is assumed to be the

sum of V in equation 3.1 and a function of real balances Z(M/0), where
Z'

and Z"

< 0:

= E(d/W) -(l/2)R[var(dW/)} + Z(M/Q).

(3.68b)

Solving (3.68a) for the share of foreign securities A yields exactly the

same expression as the one in equation (3.1), which is derived from the

-82-

two asset model with no money. Equation (3.68b) implies a value for the
share of money

given values for W/Q and i. Below we assume some

specific forms for the function Z(M/Q) and solve explicitly for p. The
share of home securities is determined as a residual.

The optimal portfolio has some interesting properties. The
investor can be viewed as making his portfolio allocation decision in two

steps. First, he divides his portfolio between foreign securities and
total home assets, money and securities, according to equation (3.68a).
Then, he expands his money holdings until equation (3.68b) is satisfied.

The rest of the portfolio goes into home securities. A change in wealth
or the home interest rate alters the holdings of all assets, but a change
in the foreign interest rate affects only holdings of home and foreign

securities. Changes in the transactions demand for money are changes in
Z'. Since these changes do not affect equation (3.68a), the resulting
adjustments in money holdings are matched one for one by adjustments in

home security holdings. All of these properties are reflected in the
basic specification of asset markets of section 2, except that in the
basic specification money demand does not depend on wealth.

Assuming specific forms for Z(M/Q) makes it possible to solve

explicitly for p or the demand for real balances. First, suppose
Z(M/Q) =

aln(M/Q).-3"

Then Z' =

a/(M/Q), and according to (3.68b) the

demand for real balances is

M/Q =

(/i)(W/Q).

(3.69)

-83-

Now, suppose Z(M/Q) =

(M/Q)/.

Then Z' =

(M/QY

and the demand for

real balances is

1

(W/iO)'.

M/Q =

If the underlying utility function displays constant relative risk

aversion, U() =

/y, the

solution of the lifetime consumption problem

implies that optimal real consumption

wealth t
can

at

is a constant fraction of real

every point in time.4' In this case the demand for money

be written as
1

M/O =

with

real consumption as the "activity" variable.
Under an alternative set of assumptions money demand depends on

real income V. Suppose that a measure of real transactions is given by
kV and that the augmented objective function V is equal to the sum of V
in equation (3.1) and a function that is linear homogeneous in real
balances i and real transactions Z =

where 0 <

and money demand is given by

< 1. In this

The arguments of this money demand function are the same as those of the
money demand function in the basic specification of asset markets of
section 2 except that the arguments of this money demand function include
real wealth.

4. Conclusions

The microeconomic theory of asset demands discussed in section 3 implies
some but not all of the properties of the basic specification of asset

markets in section 2. Under the assumptions of section 3 the demand for
the sum of assets denominated in each currency is homogeneous of degree
one in nominal wealth, and the demand for money in each country depends

on the return on the security denominated in that country's currency hut
not on the return on securities denominated in other currencies.
However, under these same assumptions the demand for money depends on

real wealth. Since the conclusions of macroeconomic analysis often
depend crucially on the form of asset demand functions, it is important
to continue to explore the implications of the microeconomic theory of
section 3 and other microeconomic approaches.
The consumer of section three arrives at his asset demands by

maximizing his utility given interest rates and the parameters of the

distributions of prices and exchange rates. Of course, the distributions
of prices and exchange rates are not invariant to changes in the
distributions

of policy variables and stochastic components of tastes

1/

Almost all the contributions to the literature on asset markets in

open economies in the references of this chapter were published in 1975

or later. Many important contributions were published before 1975.
Bryant (1975) provides an excellent assessment of empirical research on

financial capital flows up to the mid 1970's. He includes in his
references most of the important theoretical and empirical analyses

dealing specifically with asset markets in open economies that were
available when he wrote.
2/

The portfolio balance approach to macroeconomic modeling was

developed by Metzler (1951) and Tobin (1969).
3/

This argument is often referred to as the Lucas (1976) critique.

4/

Throughout the rest of this paper home currency securities and

foreign currency securities are referred to as home securities and

foreign securities respectively. In order to simplify the analysis, we
assume that there are no home and foreign capital stocks and, therefore,

no equity claims on those capital stocks. Models with capital stocks and
equity claims are discussed by Bruce and Purvis in chapter 16 and by
Obstfeld and Stockman in chapter 17.

5/ We assume that the sum of the partial derivatives of each asset
demand function with respect to its first four arguments is zero so that,
4
for example

m< =

0.

Under this assumption expressing any asset demand

k =0

as a function of nominal returns is equivalent to expressing it as a
function of real returns since the expected rate of change of the price

of a country's consumption bundle in terms of its currency can be
subtracted from all nominal returns without changing the value of the
asset demand.

6/ Precisely, the assumption that expectations are static implies
that c

is

exogenous. However, it is usual to specify paths for the

exogenous variables other than E

that

lead to a unique value for the

steady state actual rate of depreciation, and it is natural to set E

equal to that value. Throughout this section it is assumed that the
asset stocks available for the public to hold do not change continuously

over time ( =

=

=

= 0).

Steady states are stationary states in

which the actual rate of depreciation is equal to zero, so it makes sense
to set c equal to zero under static expectations. Kouri (1q76) develops
a model

in

which residents of the home country face a fixed foreign

currency price of the single world good and allocate their wealth between

home and foreign money. He sets the exogenous expected rate of
depreciation equal to the exogenous positive rate of growth of home money
under static expectations.

7/ Models that allow for currency substitution have been constructed by
Girton and Roper (1981), Kareken and Wallace (1981), Lapan and Enders

(1980), and Nickelsburg (1983) among others. In most contributions

-91-

currency substitution is defined as substitution among national moneys

defined as currency and coin plus deposits that bear non market related

or zero rates of interest. According to firton and Roper, currency
substitution warrants special study because moneys are the only financial
assets that have their stated returns, if any, fixed in terms of

themselves. Girton and Roper employ postulated money demand functions.
Kareken and Wallace, Lapan and Enders, and Nickelsburg assume that moneys
are the only stores of value in models with overlapping generations
composed of individuals who maximize explicit utility functions.

8/ If goods prices, outputs, and initial asset holdings are taken as
exogenous, the model of equations (2.9) is representative of short-run

portfolio balance models of international financial markets. Other
models of this type are employed by Black (1973), Dooley and Isard
(1982), Frankel (1983), Freedman (1977), Girton and Henderson (1977,
1976a, 1976b), Henderson (1979), Herring and Marston (1977a, 1977b),
Hewson and Sakakibara (1975), Kouri and Porter (1974), and Marston

(1980). When short-run portfolio balance models are used to analyze a
regime of flexible exchange rates, it is usually assumed that exchange
rate expectations are static or regressive.

11/ The implications of several alternative specifications of goods
markets are considered by Bruce and Purvis in chapter 16.

12/ For simplicity we adopt the system of taxes and transfers under
which interest payments do not enter the analysis suggested by Allen and

Kenen (1980). Each government taxes away all the interest received by
the residents of its country and transfers to the government of the
other country an amount equal to the interest received by the residents

of its country from the other country. Under this system, the current
account surplus and trade account surplus of a country are equal , and if

the budget of the government of a country is balanced, the disposable
income of its residents is equal to output minus government spending.

13/ For simplicity we assume that saving in each country does not
depend on the real returns on home and foreign securities. If this
assumption were relaxed in the case of flexible prices and rational

expectations, it would be necessary to analyze a system of four
differential equations rather than a system of two differential
equati ons.
*

14/ Our assumption about the effects of increases in P and EP on home
and foreign spending on home and foreign goods is sufficient but not

-93-

necessary to insure that increases in P reduce the home trade surplus and
*
that increases in EP increase it. Of course, without our assumption it
is possible that increases in P increase the home trade surplus and that
*
increases in EP reduce it.

15/ In the derivation of equations (2.21) we make use of the
appropriately modified versions of equations (2.1) and equations (2.19).
16/

In the relatively lengthy and tedious derivation of equations (2.22)

we make use of the appropriately modified versions of equations (2.1),

equations (2.18), and equations (2.19). We approximate the goods market
equilibrium conditions and the balance of payments equation around longrun equilibrium where home and foreign saving are zero.

In the

neighborhood of long run equilibrium equations (2.18) and (2.19) imply a
key relationship:

+

X2W - y2W.

17/ This assertion can be confirmed by substituting relationships
implied by equations (2.18) and 2.19) into the definitions of

and
18/

If s2 is not equal to s, the indirect effect from the induced price

changes does not necessarily reinforce the direct effect. However, the
overall effect of the transfer on the trade surplus is always to reduce
it; that is C6 is always positive.

19/ Kouri (1983a) uses this terminology.

equation (2.20) and equation (2.24) with e = e is -

The instability problem associated with negative net foreign asset

positions is a central issue in several recent papers: Boyer (1977);
Branson, Haittunen, and Masson (1979); and Martin and Masson (1979). It
is also discussed by Tobin and de Macedo (1981). Tobin (1980) summarizes
a main conclusion reached in these papers. The problem is considered
further by Henderson and Rogoff (1982), Kouri (1983a), Masson (1981), and

Melitz (1982). The conclusions presented here are similar to those of
Henderson and Rogoff and Kouri but somewhat different from those of

Masson. Melitz argues that the transactions demand for money is an
important stabilizing influence.

23/

The negative net foreign asset case is not the only portfolio

constellation that has led analysts to question the stability of open

economy portfolio balance models. Enders (1977) and Masson (1980)
discuss the possibility that instability might arise when positive net

foreign asset positions are "too large." See footnotes 24, 26, 8, and
30.
24/

If Ce is positive but there is foreign asset preference (b7 <

b7),

long-run equilibrium is definitely unstable under static expectations.
With goods prices fixed, b7 <

is

a necessary and sufficient condition

for c to be negative. In this case, as in the perverse case of the
text, the As schedule is upward sloping. It can be shown that if the
assumption that in each country the demand for the good produced in the
other country is independent of nominal spending is dropped, long—run

-95-

equilibrium is stable for some, but not all, parameter values. Thus,
with goods prices fixed, the Enders (1977) problem of instability caused
by large net foreign asset positions can arise even if it is assumed that
the home trade surplus depends on nominal spending in both countries.
25/

See footnote 20.

If Ce > 0 but b7 <

b7

so that

<

0, long-run equilibrium is

definitely not a saddle point. The determinant of the differential
equation system made up of equation (2.20) and equation (2.24) with

> 0.

= e is -

It can be shown that either the two roots of the

characteristic equation are real and positive or they are complex

conjugates with positive real parts. It can also be shown that if the
assumption that in each country the demand for the good produced in the
other country is independent of nominal spending is dropped, long—run
equilibrium is a saddle point under rational expectations if and only if

it is stable under static expectations. Thus, with goods prices fixed,
the Enders (1977) problem can arise under rational expectations even if
it is assumed that the home trade surplus depends on nominal spending in
both countries.
27/

This assertion is proved in Appendix 1.

If Ce

is

positive but there is foreign asset preference (b7 <

long—run equilibrium is definitely stable under static expectations
With goods prices flexible and b7 <

b7,

may he negative and C5 is

definitely negative. Thus, the A5 schedule may be upward sloping, and
the w = 0 schedule is definitely downward sloping. It is shown in

-96-

Appendix 1 that if the As schedule is downward sloping, it is flatter
than the w = 0 schedule. Although the effect of a wealth transfer on the

exchange rate depends on the slope of the As schedule, long-run

equilibrium is stable whatever the slope of this schedule. Thus, with
good prices flexible, the Enders (1977) problem cannot arise.

It is shown in Appendix 1 that the determinant of the differential

equation system made up of equation (2.22c) and equation (2.25) with
e is always negative.

If e is positive but there is foreign asset preference (b7 <

long-run

equilibrium is definitely a saddle point under rational

expectations. See footnote 21.

Markowitz (1959) and Tobin (1965) laid the foundations of portfolio

selection theory.
32/

Merton (1971) pioneered this approach.

33/

Merton (1969) shows that the portfolio allocation decision is

independent of the saving decision in a continuous time model. He
assumes both that the investorss utility function exhibits constant
relative risk aversion and that percentage changes in asset prices follow
geometric

Brownian motion. Samuelson (1969) derives the same result in a

discrete time model. He assumes constant relative risk aversion but puts
no restrictions on the distribution of returns.
34/

Merton (1971) proves this result.

35/

Solnik (1974) was the first to analyze portfolio selection in an

open economy using stochastic calculus. He assumes that residents of
each country consume only the good produced in that country and that
goods prices are non stochastic.
