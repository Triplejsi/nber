Exchange Market Intervention Under Alternative Forms
of Exogenous Disturbances

ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes exchange market intervention in a

stochastic model of a small open economy. The distinction is made
between disturbances which are unanticipated and anticipated on the one
hand, and those that are perceived as being transitory or permanent, on

the other. The paper demonstrates how the appropriate form of exchange
market intervention is sensitive to these aspects of the disturbances.
Of particular interest is the case of an unanticipated permanent disturbance, when output may be stabilized perfectly about its friction—
less level by the use of a very simple class of intervention rules.
The optimal rules in other cases are also discussed.

1. INTRODUCTION
With

the

freeing up of exchange rates during the last decade,

interest has turned recently to questions related to exchange rate

management. A particular issue which has been addressed by several
economists is the determination of the optimal exchange rate regime,

through intervention in the foreign exchange market. This literature
has been developed within the context of small stochastic macro models,
which in many respects are extensions of the well known framework
developed by Poole (1970); see, e.g., Boyer (1979), Henderson (1979),
Cox (1980), Roper and Turnovsky (1980), Frenkel and Aizenman (1982),

and Turnovsky (1983). These models derive optimal intervention rules
to stabilize some objective, typically domestic output, on the assumption that the stochastic disturbances impinging on the economy are all
white noise; i.e., the stochastic disturbances are both unanticipated

and transitory. One of the main conclusions to emerge is that the
optimal policy can vary widely and depends critically upon the sources
and relative magnitudes of the various stochastic disturbances.
In practice, of course, the stochastic disturbances facing an

economy vary not only in origin, but also in nature. While some disturbances are .unanticipated, others are expected; and while some may

be transitory, others may be perceived as being permanent shifts. It
would seem reasonable to expect that the appropriate form of exchange
market intervention will depend upon these characteristics of the dis-

turbances. To investigate this question is the purpose of this paper.
Specifically, we extend the framework employed by Turnovsky (1983) to
determine optimal exchange market intervention rules when the exogenous

—2—

disturbances facing the economy may be of quite general form. In
particular, we draw the distinction between disturbances which are:
(a) perceived as transitory or permanent, on the one hand, and (b)
unanticipated or anticipated, on the other.

2. THE MODEL
To keep technical details down to a minimum, the simplest model

will be used. Consider a small open economy which consumes and produces
a single traded good. Assume also, that there is a single traded bond,
with the domestic bond market being perfectly integrated with that in

the rest of the world. Thus purchasing power parity (PPP) and uncovered
interest parity (IJIP) are assumed to hold.

Expressing all variables in deviation form, the model may be

written as

in domestic output supply.

The first three equations of the model are quite standard.
Given purchasing power parity, the domestic price of a freely traded
commodity equals the price abroad multiplied by the exchange rate.
Equation (la) is just the logarthmic version of this relationship.
Equation (ib) specifies domestic money market equilibrium, with the

—4—

demand for money depending positively upon domestic income and negatively upon the domestic interest rate, and also upon an additive dis-

turbance u.-' The assumption of perfectly capital market integration
is embodied in the interest rate parity condition (ic).

The remaining two equations are somewhat less standard and

require further comment. Equation (id) specifies a money supply rule.
We assume that all changes in the domestic money supply are brought
about by the accumulation or decumulation of foreign reserves through
intervention in the foreign exchange market, with the central bank's
liabilities created against the purchase of domestic assets remaining

fixed. The underlying notion behind (id) is that the intervention
authority has current information on all the financial variables, e.
and ui1,

as well as the domestic price level p. Thus we postulate

m =

+

v2r + V3W

+

4t

Using the PPP condition (la) and the UIP condition (ic), this equation

is equivalent to the form (id). The coefficients

are the policy

parameters and the optimal intervention policy is to choose them so

as to optimize an objective, yet to be specified. Note that the

observability of e and p, together with PPP, implies the observability
of the foreign price level

In contrast to most of the existing

intervention literature which restricts the rule to depend upon only
the current exchange rate, (id) allows it to depend upon observations
of other variables, which are observable with virtually equal frequency
as exchange rates, thereby enabling the intervention authority to base
its decisions on a wider information set.

—5—

The supply of domestic output is specified by (le). This
relationship postulates the deviation in output from its full employment level to depend upon the unanticipated component of the current
domestic price of output, a current productivity disturbance and the
previous period's expectation of the current productivity disturbance.
This specification can be derived from the one period wage contract models

of Fischer (1977) and Gray (1976) and is given in the Appendix. Using this
specific framework, y is a function of the labor exponent in the firm's
Cobb—Douglas production function, while n is the supp1r elasticity of

labor. As shown in the derivation, the expectation of the productivity
disturbance enters the supply function through its influence on the wage

contract. Under the commonly made assumption that these disturbances
are independently distributed over time, this expectational term is just

zero. Finally, equation (if) describes the rationality of expectations.
There are four additive disturbances in the model, two of

domestic origin (u,v) and two of foreign origin (qw). The existing literature treats these as being purely random variables, which are

independently distributed over time. They are therefore unanticipated
and transitory. In this analysis, we do not restrict them in this way.
All we shall assume is that they be exogenous to the small country under
consideration.

3. SOLUTION OF MODEL
In order to solve the model, we first take conditional expecta-

tions of (la)—(le). This is most conveniently done by considering the
expectations for an arbitrary date i, formed at some initial date o

to render the system unstable (in the sense of the igenvalue (l—1+c2)/
lying outside the unit circle) then the stable solution is such
that the expectation of the exchange rate for time i, formed at time 0
is a function of the discounted sum of expectations for all periods into

the future. This is the conventional form of rational expectations
solutions and arises in the case of a perfectly flexible exchange rate
(i.

=

0).

On the other hand, if the degree of intervention is such

as to render the system stable (in the sense that the eigenvalue lies
within theunit circle), then tFie stable solution for expectations is
a backward function of past expectations, where we assume that pre-

dictions formed at time 0 for current or past values are correct.'
To obtain the solutions for the key endogenous variables

following matrix equation

It is clear that the choice of conditioning date, 0, was made for notational
convenience and that analogous solutions to (5) hold with respect

to expectations formed at any arbitrary time t. Specifically, the relevant
expressions appearing in (6) are

In our analysis below, we shall deal with two important cases.

In order to determine the optimal degree of intervention, we

must introduce a criterion function. In the literature, two alternative
criteria are frequently adopted. The first of these is the conventional
one of minimizing the variance of domestic output about its constant

long—run mean. The second, introduced by Barro (1976) and Gray (1976)
is the minimization of the variance of output about its full information

frictionless level. This latter quantity, denoted by y, is defined as
being the level of output that would prevail if wages were fully flexible

and not preset by a contract. In the present model, it is well known that

—9—

(12)

so that y fluctuates to some degree with the productivity disturbance

embodied in v. While both criteria are of interest, and indeed identical
with respect to all but the supply disturbances, we shall focus on
the latter, which recently has been increasingly adopted in the
literature.—

Solving the matrix equation (6), we find that the short—run
solutions for the endogenous variables Yt' Pt and e are given by

two which we assume to be exogenous. It is evident that the degree of
exchange market intervention as described by the parameters p influences

—10--

the behavior of the economy in two ways. First, it affects how expectations
of future exchange rates respond to expectations about the exogenous

disturbances embodied in z+; secondly, it affects how the current
stochastic disturbances u, v,

and w impinge on the domestic

economy.

4. OPTIMAL EXCHANGE MARKET INTERVENTION
Equations (6) and (4) form the basis for our analysis of
optimal exchange market interventIon. The assumptions we have made
are sufficiently general to enable us to analyze intervention policies
under quite arbitrary assumptions regarding the nature of the exogenous

disturbances impinging on the economy. We shall restrict our attention
to distinguishing between disturbances wtich are: (a) unanticipated

or anticipated; (b) perceived as being transitory or permanent. Note
that in making the latter distinction, we can do so only in terms of

the perception at the time they occur. It is quite possible that a
disturbance which when it occurs at time t say is expected to be per-

manent, is in fact reversed during the next period. Initially, it will
have been perceived as being permanent, although in fact it will turn
out to be only transitory.

(a) Unanticipated, Perceived Transitory, Disturbances
Consider the situation in which all disturbances are independently distributed over time; they are therefore unanticipated and per-

ceived as being transitory. As noted above, this case has been extensively discussed in the literature and hence our treatment can be brief.
This case is parameterized by setting

therefore follows from (6) that

with tlie corresponding solution for output being

(15)

Note that the solution of output is independent of the intervention parameter

This is because for white noise disturbances e÷i = 0.

It is evi—

dent from (15) that the values of the optimal policy parameters, i.

which minimize the variance of output around y can be attained recursively.

It therefore follows that by appropriate intervention in response to

it is possible to stabilize domestic output perfectly against all

expectations, the variance of output about

Thus the optimal intervention policy can be conveniently expressed
in terms of responses in the domestic money supply to movements in:

(1) the domestic nominal interest rate; and (ii) the domestic price level.
A one percentage point rise in the former should be met by a a2 percent

reduction in the money supply. A one percent rise in the domestic price
level should be accommodated by a less than one percent rise in the

nominal money supply. The adjustment depends positively upon the variance
of the domestic real disturbance and inversely on the variance of the

domestic monetary disturbance. Substituting for the optimal l into
(18) we find that the optimized variance of output is generally strictly

positive. One is not able to stabilize output perfectly about its

frictionless level, unless either u E 0 or v 0. Further discussion
of the present case is given by Turnovsky (1984).

(b) Unanticipated, Perceived Permanent, Disturbances
Suppose that the disturbances occurring at time t were previously
(i.e., at time t—l) unanticipated, but having occurred are expected to be

permanent. This is parameterized by assuming q t—l =

all j,

=

z,

v*

rate expectations are generated by

The corresponding solution for real output, obtained by substituting
(22a), (22b) into (13a), is

=

(23)

The optimal intervention policy follows immediately upon

inspection of (23). It is simply to set

remaining parameters 2' i3,

p,

(1-I-a2), allowing the

to be set arbitrarily, thereby yield-

ing a very general optimal policy rule

m = (l+a2)e + 2+l,t +

+

(24)

Intervening in accordance with this rule ensures that y is stabilized
perfectly at its frictionless level, irrespective of the source of the
stochastic disturbances.

This is an extremely powerful result and contrasts dramatically
with the more familiar case where disturbances are unanticipated and

transitory. In that situation optimal intervention depends upon a
knowledge of the relative variances of the domestic disturbances and

does not in general succeed in stabilizing income perfectly. For disturbances which are perceived as being permanent, however,

interven-

tion rule, which includes the leaning with the wind component m =

(l+a2)e

will stabilize income perfectly about its frictionless level.
The key to understanding the economic intuition underlying this

result is the domestic money market. Combining (la), (ib) and (ic) we
have

If the domestic monetary authorities intervene in accordance with the

(26b)

Being unanticipated, prior to the disturbance, the exchange rate is not

expected to change. However, since the disturbance having occurred is
expected to be permanent, the exchange rate in the following period is

expected to adjust in response to the disturances in U, v, u and
The adjustment in the domestic interest rate which is the immediate consequence of this is precisely such as to render the excess demand for

nominal money balances independent of the disturbances u,

It is clear from this equation that whatever values of 2' 113

chosen, the expected exchange rate, given by the term in parentheses,

simply adjusts appropriately, Cancelling terms, equation (27) reduces to

thereby stabilizing income about its frictionless level.

(28)

—15—

The fact that 112 i3, and p4 may be set arbitrarily means

that the optimal intervention rule can be specified in a number of con-

venient ways. Perhaps the most convenient is to set p

p = p,

=

0,

in which case (24) reduces to the simple leaning with the wind rul'

=

0,

However, setting 12 = U3

p4 =

(l+c)e
(l+a2),

enables it to be expressed

in the form

nit =

(l+c)p

in which case the optimal policy is specified in terms of a more than
proportionate accommodation of the money supply to the domestic price

level. Also, setting

=

=

—(l+c2),

p3

p4 =

0, the rule can be expressed

in terms of the domestic interest rate

=

_(l+cL2)r

In all cases, the perfect stabilization of domestic output is due to the

appropriate adjustment of the expected exchange rate. Which is the most
convenient form will presumably depend upon the availability and reliability of the necessary information.

It is worth noting that in some cases, output can be stabilized -

optimally

using yet another rule. Recall (23) and consider the term

Setting

one can eliminate the variance in

However, in general one cannot eliminate com-

and

pletely the total variance due to domestic disturbances, unless of
course one sets

=

(l+a2), as discussed above. But if u 0 (02 = 0),

so that the only domestic disturbances are dueto productivity disturbances,

can be stabilized about y by adopting the rule
=

[1 — cL1(l+n)1p. —

a2r

(29)

This policy is identical to (21), derived in the case of transitory
shocks, when one sets a2 = 0 in the latter.

The economic rationale for this result follows from a considera-

tion of both the domestic money market and domestic supply function. Substituting (29) into (25) and simplifying (noting that expectations at
tiem t—l are zero), these two relationships simplify to respectively
—yt
Pt =

yt

=

YP +

The solution for y is again given by (28). The productivity shock
as it impinges on the domestic supply function, generates fluctuations

in output which exceed those of the frictionless economy. If by intervening in the exchange market, the price level can be made to bear part
of the adjustment, the fluctuations in output can be dampened down to
the appropriate level.

In the two cases we have thus far considered, we have assumed
that the private sector in its perception as to whether the disturbances

which have occurred are permanent or transitory. Of course in due course

—17—

they may prove to be wrong, but our assumption is that agents can form

a

subjective characterization of them. In fact, of course, they may be
unable to decide whether a disturbance which has occurred represents a

permanent shift or is simply a transitory shock. One way to formalize
this is to assign a probability to these states. In this case the
expected exchange rate formed at time t becomes
—Oz

(30)

where 0 is. the probability of the disturbance being permanent. This
expression is derived by taking an average of (14) and (22b), each weighted
by their respective probabilities 1 —

0,0.

The analysis can be carried

out as before, with (22b) being replaced by (30). However, if 0 <

1,

it

can be shown that in general perfect stabilization of y about y is not
9/

possible.—

(c) Random Walks
Section 4(b) has dealt with the case of once—and—for—all disturbances, initially unanticipated, but ex post perceived as being per-

manent. This is closely related to the important case where the disturbances
follow random walks. In this case the relevant random variables appearing
in (14) are generated by

where the

+

are independently distributed random variables having zero

means and finite variances. Any

—18—

t—1, but having occurred, is perceived at time t as being permanent and

becomes part of all future expectations formed at that time. For this
process, the expectations of the exchange rate formed at time t and t—1
are respectively

t+lt

(31)

and substituting (31) into (14a), the solution for output is given by

This is virtually identical to (23), the only difference being that the

disturbance terms z, v, and

reflecting

are replaced by their changes, n,

the non—stationarity. of the random walk process. The

optimal policy is again given by (25) and the explanation given previously continues to apply.

(d) Anticipated Disturbances
Thus far, all disturbances have been assumed to be unanticipated.
Sometimes, however, they may be known in advance and as an example consider

vi

the following. Suppose that at time t—1 agents perfectly anticipate all
disturbances for the next period; i.e.,

=

=

v,

z,_1 =

However, although they know the magnitude.s of these shocks for the next

period, they do not know whether they are transitory shocks or permanent

shifts. Suppose that at time t—l, before the disturbances occur, agents

assign a probability e1 to the event that they are permanent, so that
(l.e1) equals the probability that they perceive it as being transitory.
The expected exchange rate for time t formed at time t—l is therefore

z.

equation is simply an average of (9), (11) at t—l weighted by

their respective probabilities. Substituting (33) into (l3a) we find
that the solition for output becomes

arbitrary will stabilize output perfectly at its

The reason is as follows. If the shocks are perfectly anticipated,
the supply function (le) becomes

Y(e_e_i)

Thus output will be stabilized at y if and only if

+ y (35)

e.

However,

in general the current exchange rate e is influenced by e+i through
the interest rate in the money market equilibrium relationship. By
adopting an intervention rule with

a2,

the monetary authority

eliminates the effect of the expected future exchange rate from the
money market condition, reducing it to

Combining (36) and (37), the money market equilibrium condition (36)
reduces' further to

Obviously (35) and (38) together imply y =

y.

Note that the arbitrari-

ness of the remaining policy parameters means that the policy rule can
be expressed in a variety of ways, the most convenient of which is

m =

cz2r

(39)

This enables the monetary authority to monitor the domestic interest rate,
rather than trying to infer exchange rate expectations.

Alternatively, (34) implies that the perfect stability of output will also prevail if

is the probability, held at time t, of the disturbance at time

t being permanent. Thus from (40) and (41) we see that output will be

stabilized perfectly about y if and only if

=

6t—l'

i.e., if and

only if agents' perception of the duration of the disturbance does not

change between time t—l and t. This holds for any intervention rule,

including no intervention at all. Essentially, if all disturbances are
fully anticipated and the perceived degree of permanence is unchanged,
any response in the exchange rate which may occur as a cotlsequence of

an arbitrarily chosen intervention policy, will be fully anticipated.
Any movements in the domestic price level will hence be perfectly anticipated and output will fluctuate about its frictionless level.

5. CONCLUSIONS
The literature on exchange market intervention has restricted
the stochastic disturbances impinging on the economy to be purely random

white noise. In this paper we have allowed these disturbances to be of
more general form. In particular, we have drawn the distinction between
disturbances which are unanticipated and anticipated on the one hand,
and those that are perceived as being transitory or permanent on the other.
In general, we have seen that the appropriate form of exchange market
intervention (or more generally money supply rule) is sensitive to these
aspects of the disturbances and several interesting conclusions emerge.
Disturbances which are unanticipated and perceived as being

transitory are the most difficult to stabilize. While the optimal rule
turns out to be quite a simple one, involving only the domestic price
level and interest rate, the coefficients do depend upon knowing the
relative variances of the domestic stochastic disturbances and in general

—22—

it will not succeed in stabilizing output about its frictionless level.

By contrast, if the disturbances are perceived as being permanent, then
income may be stabilized about its frictionless level by adopting any
monetary rule which includes the leaning with the wind component
=

(l+a2)e.

The rest of the rule can be specified quite arbitrarily,

enabling it to he expressed in a number of convenient, but equivalent,

ways. Essentially, the arbitrariness of the rule is due to the appropriate
adjustment of the expected exchange rate to each such specification. If
all disturbances are perfectly anticipated one period in advance, but
are unknown as to whether they are to be transitory or permanent, a
simple money supply rule involving the appropriate accomodation to the

domestic interest rate will stabilize output perfectly. If both the
magnitude and the degree of permanence of the disturbances are known, then
any rule——including no intervention—— will provide perfect stability.

APPENDIX

Derivation

of Supply Function (le)

As noted in the text, the supply function is based on the one

period wage contract model. We assume that the wage for time t is
determined at time 5—1, such that given expectations of firms and

workers, the labor market is expected to clear. The expected supply
of labor, expressed in logarithms, at the contract wage is

it follows that the expected demand for labor, Nt..i;(based on expected

set to zero to ensure that the solution is stable. In the case of
(5b), however, stability considerations alone do not suffice to
determine A0. This can be determined only by invoking some additional restriction. In Turnovsky (1983), the procedure was adopted
of choosing A so as to minimize the one period variance of the
exchange rate. This approach, which is a variant of the procedure
proposed by Taylor (1977), turns out to make the subsequent determination of the optimal intervention policy rather complicated. In the
present analysis we invoke the "minimum state representation" procedure
proposed recently by McCallum (1983). This involves picking the
rational expectations solution based on the simplest soltuion and
means that A0 = 0, quite apart from stability considerations. The
notion that solutions are based on minimum information is attractive
in that it embodies the idea that forecasters use scarce information
efficiently.
