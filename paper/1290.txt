Labor Compensation and the Structure of Private Pension Plans:

Evidence for Contractual Versus Spot Labor Markets

ABSTRACT

Distingiishing "spot" versus "contract" views of the labor market is of
critical importance to a host of economic issues ranging from wage flexibility
over the business cycle to firm financial valuation. The structural features of
U.S. private pension plans permit surprisingly strong inferences concerning the
incentive effects of private pension plan provisions and the contractual nature
of the U.S. labor market. This paper examines the accrual of vested pension
benefits of a nation—wide sample of pension plans. We find strikingly large
discontinuities in the profile by age of the ratio of annual accrued pension
benefits to the standard wage. These discontinuities primarily occur at the
ages of full vesting and early retirement. Representative plans often exhibit
absolute changes in accrual ratios of 20 to 30 percentage points at these ages.
The provisions of many plans imply large negative accruals after the age of
early retirement. Job change typically involves a large loss in pension wealth
as well. Since the average worker's marginal product presumably changes
smoothly as he or she ages, these pension data can only be reconciled with spot
market clearing if age wage profiles within a firm exhibit exactly offsetting
discontinuities at key ages. Casual inspection of firm wage setting behavior
rules out this requirement of spot market clearing. In our view the magnitude,
patterns, and variations in pension accrual ratios are strikingly at odds with
spot market equilibrium. While market clearing in longer term contracts seems
the only equilibrium theory consistent with these findings, it also strains our
credulity to ascribe optimizing behavior to the pension accrual profiles chosen
by a vast array of U.S. businesses. In the process of presenting these profiles
we also consider the following questions concerning U.S. pensions. What are the
incentive effects of private pension plans? What is the cost in pension
benefits of job turnover? How important is vesting? Is there a cost in pension
benefits of foregoing the early retirement option? Do pension stipulations
encourage early retirement? While the considerable heterogeneity of pension
plan provisions permits no simple or single answer to these questions, the data
suggest that pensions can have major incentive effects on job turnover and
retirement. In general pensions represent a very significant factor, and at
certain ages, a dominant factor in employee compensation.

LABOR COMPENSATION AND THE STRUCTURE
OF PRIVATE PENSION PLANS: EVIDENCE FOR
CONTRACTUAL VERSUS SPOT LABOR MARKETS

by
Laurence J. Kotlikoff
and
David A. Wise

What are the incentive effects of private pension plans? What is the

cost in pension benefits of job turnover? How important is vesting? Is there a
cost in pension benefits of foregoing the early retirement option? Do pension
stipulations encourage early retirement? By analyzing the stipulations of pension plans, we are able to develop considerable evidence directed to these

questions. At the same time, the structural features of private pension plans
permit new and potentially strong inferences concerning the contractual nature
of labor market agreements and the role of pensions in assisting such arrange—
me nt s.

Understanding the contractual arrangements between workers and firms is
important for a host of economic issues ranging from the degree of wage flexibility over the business cycle to the availability of human capital insurance

within the firm. Discriminating between "spot" and "long—term contract" views
of the labor market is also critical for evaluating numerous questions specific

to private pensions. One such question is whether workers and employers fully
appreciate how complex pension plan provisions alter a firm's total compensation

package. Evidence that labor markets closely accord to the predictions of a
spot market would suggest rather small information problems. Equally productive
workers, in this case, receive identical total annual remuneration regardless of

—2—

their current employer or the specifics of the employer's pension plan.

A second question involves proper disclosure and valuation of a pension

plan's net financial liabilities. In a spot market setting an employer's net
liability corresponds simply to the accrued value of vested pension benefits.

Additional pension liabilities projected to arise from future employment, in
such a setting, are matched dollar for dollar by future projected revenues asso—
ciated with the w'orker'e continued employment

The excess of projected over

accrued liabilities should not, therefore, affect a firm's valuation and
suggests no case for estimating and disclosing projected pension liabilities.
Under a long—term contract arrangement, on the other hand, revenue from continued employment need not match the accrual of future pension liabilities, plus
the payment of tenure wages, and the disclosure of projected rather than accrued
liabilities is potentially more relevant for firm financial valuation.
A third question is the effect of pensions on labor nobility and

hiring practices. In a spot market environment the particular and quite peculiar rates of pension benefit accrual with ae described here would have no
consequences for labor nobility, since offsetting increases or reductions in
direct wage compensation would leave the worker indifferent between staying on
the current job or switching to another job offering an identical amount of

total compensation. A spot market would also entail flexibility in wage
compensation sufficient to permit hiring equally productive old and young, black
and white, male and female workers, despite differences in their accrual of

vested pension benefits reflecting age, race, and sex specific nortality

probabilities. Long—term contractual agreements, in constrast, may leave less
flexibility to accomodate differences in individual circumstances.

—3—

Given knowledge of a worker's current and previous level of earnings,

and the benefit and retirement provisions of his pension plan, one could, in
principle, directly test the spot market hypothesis by checking whether, in each

year, the sum

of

the increment to a worker's accrued vested pension benefits

plus his wage compensation equalled his marginal product.2 Unfortunately, a

worker's marginal product is unobservable and difficult to estimate. In addition new government data linking pension plan provisions and the earnings
histories of participating workers have not yet been released.3 These data
limitations restrict, but, by no means, preclude inferences about spot versus
contractual labor market arrangements.

While little is known about the typical profile of marginal productivity by age, it seems safe to assume that this schedule does not exhibit sharp

discontinuities. In addition, while there is currently no publicly available
means of matching particular earnings histories with particular pension plans,
there is considerable information available concerning the typical shape of age—
earnings profiles.

This paper calculates the pattern of accrual of vested pension benefits

for alternative, but realistic, age—earnings profiles. These accrual profiles
are computed for a large sample of plans contained in the Bureau of Labor

Statistic's 1979 Level of Benefits Survey (BLS—LOB). This new pension data,
based on a survey of 1,1469 establishments with 3,386,121 pension participants,

provides extremely detailed information concerning pension benefits, vesting,
and early retirement formulas, all of which are key inputs to the calculation of
pension accruals.

_14—

The sum of the assumed age—earnings profile, measured in constant
dollars, and the associated real pension accrual profile equals, under the spot

market assumption, the age—marginal productivity profile. Hypothetical age—
marginal productivity profiles derived in this manner exhibit rather sharp
discontinuities at two critical ages, the age of full vesting, for plans with
cliff vesting, and the early retirement age, for plans permitting early retire-

ment on better than actuarially fair terms. For a large fraction of pension
plans making reasonable assumptions concerning age—earnings profiles and
interest rates, we find discontinuities as large as 50 percent of wage compen-

sation depending on the worker's age at hire. An alternative statement of these
findings is that for smoothly shaped age—marginal product schedules, wage compensation must potentially fall or rise by roughly 140 percent of the wage at the

age of cliff vesting and other critical ages to satisfy conditions of spot

market equilibrium. These figures appear sufficiently large to rule out the
hypothesis of spot clearing for a large segment of the U.S. labor market.

In addition to the potentially large discontinuities in pension benefit
accruals, the pattern of accruals also sheds considerable light on the potential

role of pensions in discouraging worker turnover. In many instances even
workers who change jobs with no loss in wage compensation and commence

enloyment in a new firm with an idential pension plan lose a large amount in
pension benefits.

The accrual patterns also permit inferences about incentives that pen-

sions provide for early retirement. Under our actuarial assumptions we find
positive pension accruals on average throughout the work span, i.e., worker

—5—

separation

at any time prior to normal retirement typically involves a loss of

remuneration in excess of the loss in wage compensation. These findings appear
to differ from those of Lazear (1983), 'who finds that after the age of early

retirement, continued work typically involves a loss in pension benefits. Part
of the difference in results is due to differences in interest rate and nominal

wage growth assumptions. In addition, we do not consider in this paper benefits
for au

plans covered

the LOB survey.

in particular, all plans used in this

analysis base benefits on wages.
As Lazear's (1983) insightful study points out, the present expected
value of accrued pension benefits represents a form of severance pay for workers
'who choose to separate from the firm. Such severance pay would naturally arise
in contractual settings in which workers are paid (in wages) less than their

marginal products. The severance pay may be thought of as the return of the
'worker's bond which he puts up to guarantee the quality and quantity of his work

effort. As the worker ages the value of this "severance pay" rises according to
our findings. In a contractual setting the implication of our finding of
positive average pension accrual at all ages prior to normal retirement is that
real wages represent a lower bound for the average marginal product of workers

covered by our sample of plans. It is important to emphasize, however, that we
find large deviations from the average, with large negative accruals after the
age of early retirement under the provisions of many plans.
Finally, an additional implication of our findings is that compensating
differentia.l studies of the tradeoff between wages and pension benefits, if they

are to be meaningful, cannot be based on cross—section evidence at a point in

—6—

time. To understand the relationship between compensation in the form of wages
versus pension benefits, one must consider the receipt of both over a long
period of employment.

The next section describes procedures used to calculate pension benefit
accrual and presents illustrative accrual rates for a standard earnings—based

defined benefit plan, but one that is not integrated with social security. This
plan is also used to dexnstratê the sensitivity of accrual rates to assumptions
about wage inflation and interest rates. Section II presents evidence concerning age—earnings profiles, suggesting, in particular, that for fully

employed workers between ages 55 and 65 who remain in a given firm, nominal earnings grow on average at rates commensurate with, if not greater than, infla-

tion. The assumption of positive nominal wage growth after age 55 is crucial
for generating positive pension benefit accrual between 55 and 65. Section III
describes the BLS—LOB data set in xxre detail and examines the heterogeneity of

accrual profiles for our sample of 1183 plans.5 We conclude section III by
drawing inferences from these data concerning the weight of evidence in favor of

contractual as opposed to spot labor markets. Section IV summarizes principal
findings and suggests areas for future research.

To begin, consider the benefit accrual profiles shown in Figure 1.

The

nominal wage growth incorporated in the top profile assumes moderate life cycle

growth in real wages plus a 6 percent rate of inflation. A 3 percent real
interest rate (or 9 percent nominal rate) is also assumed. The lower graphs are
based on 6 and 9 percent real (12 and 15 percent nominal) interest rates respec-

tively. In the paragraphs below we describe features of pension benefit
formulae that produce the unusual shapes of these profiles.

Vested pension benefit accrual at age a, 1(a), equals the difference
between pension wealth at age a +

Pw(a +

and pension wealth at age a,

Pw(a), accumulated to age a + 1 at the nominal interest rate r, i.e.:

Pension wealth at age a is defined as the expected value of vested pension bene-

fits discounted to age a. Intuitively, Pw(a) can be thought of as the worker's
pension bank account. If 1(a) equals zero, the worker continuing employment with
the plan sponsor at age a has exactly the same pension wealth at age a + 1 as an
identically situated worker who terminates employment at age a.

Pension accrual

is thus the increment to pension wealth in excess of the return on the previously accumulated pension bank account.

If the labor market exhibits spot market equilibrium, 1(a) plus the
worker's non-pension compensation at age a, W(a), equals the worker's marginal
product at age a, M(a):

Obviously, if W(a) is a smooth function of age, and 1(a) exhibits sharp discon—

(2)

The source of discontinuities in age accrual profiles is clarified by
considering a simple earnings—related defined benefit plan with "cliff vesting't

at 10 years of service. Vested accrued benefits are clearly zero prior to the
age at which the worker has ten years of credited service in the plan. Let

R(a,t) denote the ratio of 1(a) to W(a) for a worker age a with t years of

tenure. Then R(a,t) is zero for t <

9,

If a person age a with 9 years of ser-

vice works an additional year, the ratio of the increment to the wage W(a) is

(3). B(a,t) is the retirement benefit available to the worker who terminates

employment with the plan sponsor at age a after t years of service, but who

delays receipt of pension benefits until the plan's normal retirement age. The
normal and early retirement ages assumed for this stylized plan are 65 and 55

respectively.

Terminating workers are, however, eligible for early retirement

benefits. Our hypothetical plan reduces benefits by d percent for each year
that early retirement preceeds normal retirement. The benefit reduction rate,
d, could be greater than, equal to, or less than the actuarial fair rate. Today

most plans offering early retirement appear to stipulate smaller than
actuarially fair reduction rates; consequently, the formulae presented here
assume that workers always gain by receiving their vested accrued benefits at

—9--

the earliest possible date.
The function A(55) is the actuarial discount factor that transforms

benefit flows Initiating t age 55 into expected stocks of pension wealth at age

55. Expectations here are taken with respect to longevity. Thus A(55) is the
annuity value of a dollar's worth of pension benefits to be received each year

until death, beginning at age 55. For simplicity assume that the probability of
dying prior to age 55 is zero. Hence the present value at age a of A(55) is

R(a,t), for t increasing pari—passus with age, is zero prior to t

service. Between the age at cliff vesting and age 55, pension wealth Pw(a) is

It is important to realize that the early retirement reduction, lower

wages, and one less year of tenure yield lower benefits at 55 than at 56. The
early retirement reduction reduces benefits at the rate d. But if benefits were
taken at 55 they could accrue interest at the rate r. Thus by foregoing the

If this loss is not offset by the increase due

to wage growth and 1 year of additional tenure, there will be a drop in the
benefit accrual rate between 55 and 56.

The same considerations pertain to benefit increments between 6 and
65. Recall that we have assumed a less than fair early retirement reduction so
that benefits accrued before 55 are valued assuming receipt of benefits at the

age that yields maximum pension wealth. The optimum time to receive benefits
accrued between 55 and 56 is 56, between 56 and 57 is 57, and so forth. But to
gain benefits from working another year, it is necessary to forego the option of
immediately taking accrued benefits at an advantageous reduction rate.

contrast to the R(a,t) formula in (7) applying to the period between cliff

vesting and early retirement, (ii) indicates that the actuarial reduction
factor-—rather than the interest rate r—-imparts an upward tilt in the R(a,t)

—12—

profile between early and normal retirement, as long as the term in brackets is

positive. In (11) as in (7) and (io) the accrual rate, R(a,t) is an increasing
function of the rate of nominal wage growth. Larger nominal interest rates
reduce accrual rates at all ages, with a negative interaction with age prior to
early retirement.

Finally, while equation (T) is unlikely to be negative, wide differences between wage growth and the interest rate r can yield negative increments in

pension wealth after the early retirement age. To a first approximation, the
bracketed term in equation (ii) will be

positive

W/W is the percent increase in wages and

It is easy to see, however, that low wage growth and high interest rates will

yield negative increments. Thus actuarial increments after the early retirement
age are very sensitive to assumed values for wage growth and the interest rate.
While the preceeding formulae are suggestive of the general shape of
accrual rate profiles, there are few earnings—based plans with features as

simple as the one considered here. In addition to nre complicated rules for
plan participation and vesting that often involve age as well as service
requirements, there are a variety of methods of computing earnings bases,
including career averages, and averages of earnings, possibly highest earnings,

over a specified period or number of years. Reduction rates for early retire—

ment are often a specified function of age, if not length of service. Some
plans allow no further accrual after a given number of years of service.
Roughly thirty percent of defined benefit participants belong to plans that are

integrated with social security. There are two, not necessarily independent,
important forms of "integration." One involves a "step rate" benefit formula
that uses a different value for the percentage of the product of earnings times

—13--

service for levels of earnings below and levels above specified values. The
second is referred to as an "offset" formula which reduces pension benefits by

some fraction of the participant's basic social security benefit. Many of the
offset plans set ceilings on the extent of the offset. A minority of plans, in
particular, those with social security offset formulae, provide supplemental
benefits for early retirees prior to their receipt of social security benefits.
The supplemental benefit formulae can also be fairly involved, incorporating

both the participant's age and service in the calculation. There are also plans
that use one benefit formula to compute early retirement benefits and a dif-

ferent formula to determine normal retirement benefits. In addition to these
earnings—related plans, a significant number of plans covering over forty percent of defined benefit participants calculate benefits independent of the

participant's earnings history.6 These formulae can also be quite complex.
There are other plans that are earnings related, but provide differing flat

benefit amounts based on the participant's earnings bracket. Finally there are
plans that specify minimum and nm.ximum benefit levels.

Each of these additional features can significantly alter the profile
of accrual rates by age, especially the extent of discontinuities in the pro-

file. Our analysis in section IV of pension plans in the BLS—LOB sample takes
account of a great number of these complexities. Pwo important exceptions in
the current paper are plans with non-earnings related benefit formulae and plans

with supplemental benefit formulae. These plans will be considered in future
research.

The assumption of constant nominal interest rates implies a quite
different pattern of pension accrual than would occur with variable interest

rates. Changes in long term nominal interest rates produce capital gains and
losses on previously accumulated pension wealth that do not directly affect pen-

sion accrual. However, as indicated in equations (5), CT), (io) arid (ii),
accrual rates are also a direct function of the currently prevailing long—term

interest rates. A time path of varying

interest

rates around a constant mean

would produce a much nxre discontinuous age—pension accrual profile than those

of

2 depicts three accrual rate profiles for a worker who begins

at age 30 in a defined benefit plan similar to that described

above. The plan calculates normal retirement benefits as 1 percent of average
earnings over the last 5 years of service times years of service. Benefits are
reduced by 3 percent for each year that early retirement preceeds normal

retirement. Cliff vesting occurs after ten years. The early and normal retirement ages are 55 and 65 respectively.
Nominal wage growth is determined by two factors, a cross-sectional
profile of "merit" increases by age

and

an assumed econoniy—wide rate of wage

inflation. The merit profile involves approximately a 50 percent growth in real
wages between ages 30 and 50 and very little growth from 50 to 65.

productivity and the price level. The three profiles in Figure 2 differ both in
their assumed rate of wage inflation and nominal interest rates. The 2 percent
wage inflation profile discounts pension benefits at a 5 percent nominal rate,
while the 6 and 10 percent wage inflation profiles use 9 and 13 percent nominal
interest rates respectively.

These assumptions about wage growth and nominal interest rates produce
"vesting

spikes" ranging from

mediate wage

5 to 37 percent of vages at age bO The inter-

and interest rate assumption produces a 114 percent spike at cliff

vesting. All three profiles indicate reductions in the accrual rate of about 8
percentage points at age 56. In order to reconcile these profiles with the dictates of spot market equilibrium one must believe that marginal products rise
abruptly by an additional 5 to 37 percent exactly at age 140 and then fall by an

additional 3 to 31 percent exactly at age 141. In addition, an abrupt decline in
the worker's marginal product of close to 8 percentage points exactly at age 56
that occurs neither prior to nor after age 56 is required for the theory of spot
equilibrium.

One response to these profiles is that straight wage compensation,
rather than increasing smoothly through time, could adjust to rret the spot

market. Figure 3 suggests the implausibility of this view. Here accrual rate
profiles for workers joining the pension plan at ages 30, 140, and 50 are pre-

sented based on the intermediate wage and interest rate assumptions of Figure 2.
The vesting spikes for the three profiles are 114, 36 and 66 percent of the

corresponding wage at ages 140, 50, and 60. While vesting at these latter ages

option" repeats the accrual profile from figures 2 and 3 based on intermediate

economic assumptions. The "retirement at 65 only" profile indicates the pattern
of accrual rates for the same plan, but excludes the early retirement option.
This profile could also be labelled "actuarially fair accrual rates" since, by
definition, an actuarially fair early retirement reduction formula produces an
accrual profile that is independent of the age at which benefits are first
received.

To the extent that retirement benefits provide an incentive to continue

working, the incentive is much greater without the early retirement option than

with

it. It is important to realize that the difference is only a matter of the

pattern of

accruals; for

accumulation

workers who retire at normal retirement, the total

of accrued benefits is independent of whether the plan does or does

not have an early retirement option.

In contrast to the "early retirement option," the actuarially fair
"retirement at 65 only" profile exhibits a 6 percent rather than a l4 percent

value for R(a,l0) at cliff vesting. In addition there is no discontinuity at age
55 in the latter profile. While these features of the actuarially fair profile
are less troubling for the spot market bypothesis, the very rapid rate of benefit accrual between 55 and 65 presents other difficulties for this view of the

labor

market. The merit schedule

quite limited growth in

schedule

built into the nominal wage profile ipiies a

real wages of workers after age 55.

If anything,

this

appears to provide for too much growth in real wages after 50. As

described in the next section, cross—sectional profiles of earnings 'by age

decline slightly after age 50 for virtually all classification of workers by

occupation and major industry. Since a three percent growth in real wages due
to econoxr-wide productivity growth is above

historic averages, one might

rea-

sonably infer that real wage growth after age 55 is below three percent. The

actuarially fair profile of figure , however, entails increases in total real
pension remuneration of almost twenty percent of real wages between ages 55 and

6. Needless to say, it is difficult to accept the spot market implication
that, in addition to productivity—induced real wage growth, workers at age 65

are twenty percent ire productive than they are at age 55. Thus the plan exa—
mined in Figure 14 indicates that the difficulty in reconciling pension accrual

rates with a spot market is not simply the result of early retirement benefit
provisions.

Figure 5 and Figure 1 above demonstrate the sensitivity of the accrual

profiles to assumptions about nominal wage growth and nominal interest rates.

—i8--

Figure 5 repeats Figure

under the assumption of a 10 percent interest rate,

but no growth in wages by age. For the profile with the early retirement option
accrual rates after age 55 are substantially negative, approaching —15 percent

of salary at age 65. With no early retirement option, on the other hand,
accrual rates are always positive. The bottom profile in Figure 1 incorporates
6 percent nominal wage growth, but a 15 percent nominal interest rate. The
intermediate profile in Figure 1 is based on 6 percent wage growth and a 12 per-

cent nominal interest rate. It yields increments at 65 that are approximately
zero. These figures indicate that a considerable gap between nominal interest
rates and wage growth rates is needed to produce negative accrual rates.
Finally, we illustrate in Figure 6 the cost of job change with no early

retirement option. It should be compared with Figure 3. The plans represented
in the two diagrams are the same except that in Figure 6 the early retirement
reduction schedule is assumed to be actuarially fair (or, that there is no early

retirement option). Again, the top line of this graph shows the accrual rate
under our plan for a person who starts work at age 30 (with 6 percent wage

inflation and a 3 percent real interest rate). A person with one job change
would accumulate benefits up to age I] according to the top curve, but then

would accumulate benefits according to the curve labelled "age hi." Note that
no benefits would.be accumulated for the first ten years. The difference in
accumulated pension benefits at age 65 reflects both the difference in the areas
under the two accrual paths and the interest rate used in accumulation of these

flows. This difference could be very substantial, and depends, of course, both
on when job changes occur and how freciuently they occur. It is important to

note that the loss in accrued benefits from job change in this example is not
due solely to vesting; in figure 6 accrual, in years after vesting occurs, is
larger for a worker remaining on the same job for 35 years than for a worker who
changes jobs (literally pension plans)

This lower accrual beyond vesting for

later plan entrants results from the interaction of tenure and wage growth in

earnings based defined benefit pension formulae. To see the nature of this
interaction consider a plan with immediate vesting that pays 2 percent of I irial

year's salary times years of service. For a worker experiencing positive wage
growth
2

who is employed for say 30

percent of the age 60

salary

years and retires at 60 the pension benefit is

times 30. If this same worker experiencing the

same wage growth were to change jobs each year joining an identical plan his
benefit would equal 2 percent times the sum of the 30 annual salaries.

Assuming positive wage growth, the pension benefit of the former worker which is
based on the age 60 salary will exceed that of the latter worker whose benefit
is primarily based on the lower earnings received in earlier years of his
career.

Wage Rate Profiles

To calculate average pension benefit increments by industry—occupation
group, for a given length of employment, we need estimates of age—wage profiles
for

each group. It is particularly important that assmnptions about the wage

profiles of older workers be as realistic as possible. Without lengthy longitudinal records on individuals, we have no completely satisfactory way of estimating age—wage profiles. The Retirement History Survey (RHs), however, does
provide some longitudinal data for older workers.8 We first discuss evidence
from these data, and then present estimated age-wage profiles based on the

Current Population Survey (cPs) data. For older workers the two sources of data
seem to provide roughly consistent evidence.

The age—wage profiles appropriate for determining pension accrual are
clearly those pertaining to workers staying in the same firm, thus tenure as

well as age should be included in the analysis of earnings by age. Our accrual
profiles also assume full—time employment. Hence, wage rates per unit of time
is the appropriate earnings concept for our purposes. While conventionally computed age—earnings profiles sometimes show a downward trend for older workers,
this appears due, in part, to a reduction in hours worked, and, in part, to the
mix of ftll time and part—time workers in the sample.

A.

Evidence From the Retirement History Survey
The RHS data is based on a sample of persons who were first surveyed in

1969 when they were between 58 and 63. These respondents were resurveyed every

two years until 19T9. Table 1 shows the means of hourly wages by age and year

for persons who reported an hourly wage rate and who were not partially or fully

retired

in a given year. For a given calendar year, these data in general show

little decline in wage rates at least through age 63 or 613. The number of
observations per cell is fairly small since the cells only include older indivi-

duals who are still working. Possibly those whose wage rates would have fallen
from one year to the next are less likely to be in the sample. Analogous calculations showing the median of annual salaries of persons who reported weekly,

monthly, or annual salaries, are presented in Table 2. Here again, in the cross
section, there are relatively constant real salary levels through age 613 among

persons who are not retired, although there seems to be some decline on average.

The accrual calculations require, however, nominal wage profiles. From
both tables 1 and 2, it is clear that nominal wages of older workers increased

rather rapidly over this period. A more precise indication of nominal increases
is shown in Table 3 for all persons who reported weekly, monthly, or annual

salaries. The entry corresponding to age 58—60 and the year 1969—Ti is the
median salary increase between 1969 and 19T1 over all persons who were 58 in

1969 and who reported salary figures in both 1969 and 19T1. The other entries
are calculated in an analogous manner. The table shows very substantial nominal
increases over this period, on the order of 6 percent per year on average. (The
entries pertain to a two year interval.) Considering the average increments by
age in the last column, there is some evidence that the increases declined

somewhat with age. At least through 19T7—-after which our sample sizes are very
small——it appears that salary increases for these older workers were in general

keeping up with price increases. The percent increases in the Consumer Price
Index (cPi) for the years 1969 to 1977 were as follows:

In

short, these data suggest substantial nominal wage increases for older

workers, roughly consistent, on average, with overall inflation levels.

B. Wage—Tenure Profiles from the Current Population Survey
To estimate age tenure profiles by industry and occupation group, we

matched the May 1979 Supplement to the CPS March 1979 CPS. The May Supplement
provides tenure data, while the wage data come from the March tape. We were
able to obtain the reciuired wage, age, and tenure information for somewhat over
15,000 persons in the 21t industry—occupation groups distinguished in the LOB

survey. Relevant cell sample sizes, however, were large enough to obtain
"reasonable" estimates for only 16 groups, noted below.
After considerable experimentation with two-way tables showing average
salary by age and tenure, we elected simply to obtain least-squares estimates of
wage rates using the specification

(12)

W =

+

where W is the wage rate, A is age, and T is tenure. To estimate wage levels by
age for a person who entered a firm at, for example, age 30 we calculRted

W =

+

)(A — 30)

for values of A between 30 and 65.

The estimated profiles for the total group, and by occupation over all

industry groups, are presented in Figure 7. These profiles are empirical coun—
terparts

of the "merit" scale used in the illustrative calculations in section I

above.
The cross—sectional age earnings profile (13) for all groups combined
increases by about 50 percent between age 30 and age 52 when it reaches its

maximum. Then it declines by about 10 percent over the next 13 years, or about
.8

percent

per year on average. Assuming a wage inflation rate of 6 percent

therefore, produces a nominal wage rate for older workers increasing at about 5

percent per year. For older workers this path of nominal wage growth seems to
be in rough accord with the evidence from the Retirtxnent History Survey.

In addition to the graphs of the cross—section wage profiles, summary

indicators of their shapes are provided in Table 4. It shows salary at age 30,
maximum salary, the age of maximum salary, and salary at age 65,
average percent increases between the end points and the maximum.

III.

The BLS—LOB (1979) establishments constitute a subsample of the 1979
National Survey of Professional, Administrative, Technical and Clerical Pay.
Based on the file's population weights this subsample covers 17,965,282 private
pension plan participants in the U.S., which is slightly over half of all par-

ticipants covered by private pensions. The subsample's universe consisted of

all

firms with

retail

trade

over 100 employees with the exception of mining, construction and

establishments where the minimum firm size was 250 employees and

service establishments where the minimum firm size was 50 employees. Sampled
establishments were requested to report work schedules and information about 11

different types of fringe benefits. This information was provided for each of

the three occupational groups. The BLS—LOB (1979) pension benefits tape consists of establishment records for each occupational group that detail features

pension benefit plans covering the particular occupational group in question.
Unfortunately firm identifiers are intentionally excluded from the computer
of

record;

hence, it

is

impossible to reconstruct the actual pension charac-

teristics of the initial establishment. The data can, however, be used to esti—
mate industry—wide or occupation—wide values of pension variables.
In this section we examine accrual ratios for 1183 earnings based

defined benefit plans. Earnings based plans account for approximately 80
percent of BLS—designated usable plans from the survey and about 65 percent of

plans weighted by pension coverage.9 Each of the 1183 plans stipulates
cliff—vesting at 10 years, but the plans have different normal and early

retirement ages. Other earnings based plans with different vesting ages have

—25—

accrual profiles similar to those that we shall describe, but for convenience of

exposition we have not included them in our analysis here. Of the 1183 plans,
508 are integrated with social security under an offset formula.

Table 5 presents weighted average accrual ratios for the 1183 plans by

early and normal retirement ages for workers hired at age 31. Our intermediate
assumptions of 6 percent nominal wage growth and a 9 percent interest rate are
used in conjunction with the industry—occupation—age-earnings profiles discussed

in section II. The spike at the age of vesting varies with early retirement and
normal retirement ages. It is 21 percent for plans with early and normal
retirement at 55. Among the plans with early retirement at 55 the vesting spike
declines with the age of normal retirement, with a vesting spike of
approximately 12 percent for plans with normal retirement at 60 and a spike of

about 7 percent for plans with normal retirement at 65. For plans with later
early and normal retirement ages, the vesting spike is much smaller, ranging
from a little over 3 percent to about 5 percent.

this case, the accrual

immediately after vesting is about 5 percent and increases to about 15

27 percent. A similar pattern is observed for the other plans in which the
normal and early retirement ages are the same, but the accrual ratios just after
vesting are no riore than 1 percent in these cases. It may be noted that these
plans correspond to our earlier description of plans with no early retirement

provision, as depicted for example in figure 14 We have not calculated accrual
ratios after the age of normal retirement, but it appears that in most cases
accrual after the normal retirement age is very small and in some cases

significantly negative. Hence, there appears to be a very substantial
discontinuous drop in the rate of pension accrual after the normal retirement

age for a significant fraction of private pension plans. In subsequent work we
shall describe in detail the accrual rates of plans after the age of normal
retirement.

Plans with early retirement typically exhibit a rather slow increase in
accrual ratios after vesting until a few years before the age of early

retirement. There is often a sharp drop in the accrual ratio at that age, with
either limited increases or gradual declines in accrual ratios thereafter. For
example, of the 528 plans with early retirement at 55 and normal retirement at

6 the accrual ratio reaches about 10 percent at age 55 and then drops by about
30 percent to '(

percent at age 6. By age 65

the accrual ratio has fallen to 5

percent. The pattern exhibited by these plans is similar to the one described
in figure 14 for a typical plan with a normal retirement provision.

A comparison of plans with and without a social security offset is
presented in table 6, for plans with early retirement at 55 and normal

retirement at 55, 62, or 65. There are two major differences in these plans:
first, the within group weighted average spike at vesting is very substantial
for plans without social security offset, ranging from 12 to 26 percent and is
very small for plans with a social security offset with the exception of plans

with normal retirement at age 55. In this case the average spike at vesting is

about 8 percent. Second, the discontinuity in accrual ratios at the age of
early retirement is much larger for plans without a social security offset than

for plans with an offset. For example, among plans with normal retirement at
age 62, there is a 55 percent drop in the accrual ratio between ages 55 and 6,
while for plans with a social security offset the drop is about 17 percent.

experience faster wage growth prior to their mid—fifties, their social security
Primary Insurance .Amount, a key determinant of the benefit offset, grows at a

faster rate for younger workers. This factor plus the ceilings on the offset
amount established by many of these plans means that social security offsets
reduce accrual ratios prior to a worker's mid—fifties by a greater percentage
than after his/her mid—fifties. •As a consequence, the reduction in the accrual
ratio at age 55 is proportionally smaller in offset plans than in non—offset
plans.

To demonstrate the wide variation among plans with the same early and
normal retirement ages, we have reproduced in table 7 the accrual ratios for

plans with normal retirement at 55 and early retirement at 6, together with the
minimum and maximum accruals among these plans for each age. Almost half of the
plans have these early and normal retirement ages. The average accrual ratios,
as noted above, rise to about 10 percent by the age of early retirement and then

fall to about 5 percent by the age of normal retirement at 65. But there is a
very large variation among the plans. In particular, a large number of plans

industry. These plans exhibit a drop in the accrual ratio at the age of early
retirement that ranges from a low of 114 percent in services to a high of 35

percent in retail trade. The average accrual rate at 65 is minus 6 percent in
retail trade and plus 11 percent in finance. It is approximately 6 percent in
services and transportation and T percent in manufacturing.

Early and normal retirement supplements lead to widely varying accrual

patterns and we have not tried to summarize them here. We will, however,
present details of these plans in a subsequent paper. We shall also describe in
future work the accrual pattern of flat rate plans with benefits based only on

years of service. Approximately 35 percent of the BLS—LOB pension plans

weighted 1r coverage are of this type. They typically exhibit negative accrual
ratios after the age of early retirement.

B. Accrual Profiles and Job Change
Job change can reduce pension benefits substantially. For 7149 plans we

calculated accrued benefits at age 65 for persons hired at 31, 41, and 51. In
these calculations, we assume that a person does not become vested in another

plan prior to joining the firm. For each plan we calculate accrued benefits
using the associated industry—occupation wage profiles, for each of the hiring

ages. The comparison of benefits of persons hired at 31 with those hired at 41
and 51 is made in two ways. The first is to sum age 65 accrued benefits over
all plans for each age of hire and calculate the ratio of the sum of the
benefits if persons were hired at 41 (or 51) to the sum if the same persons

—30--

were hired at 31. The second comparison is the average of the ratios calculated
for each plan, with each ratio weighted by the number of persons covered by the
plan.

The results are shown in Table 9.
The

of

aggregate benefits of persons hired at 51 are only about 50 percent

the benefits of those hired at 31. Persons hired at 41 would accumulate

about 80 percent of the benefits of persons hired at 31. There is little
difference between plans with and without a social security offset, based on the

weighted average of plan ratios. Variation among occupations is not striking,
but there is substantial variation across industries. Benefits if hired at 51
range from only 31 percent of the benefits if hired at 31 in retail trade, to 8
percent in nnufacturing. The ratio if hired at 141 ranges from 65 percent in
retail trade to 95 percent in transportation.

Thus job change can impose a very large cost in pension benefits.
While these calculations do not incorporate vesting on one job before changing
to another, we believe that such calculations —— more in line with the
illustrations in section I —— would not substantially alter the order of

magnitude of the benefit losses. Because we used accrued benefits at age 65,
the calculations also incorporate some negative accruals after the age of early

retirement. It may be more appropriate to use maximum accrued benefits for each
age of hire.

IV. Concluding Connuents

In our view the magnitude, patterns, and variations in pension accrual
ratios are strikingly at odds with the view of spot clearing In labor markets.

While market clearing in longer term contracts seems the only equililbrium
theory consistent with these findings, it strains our credulity to ascribe opti—

mizing behavior to the choice of pension accrual profiles. It seems much more
likely that employees and employers rough tune rather than fine tune in their
choice of pension plans, if there is any tuning whatsoever.
In our future research we intend to examine the ratio of accrued vested

benefits to straight wages after the age of normal retirement. Preliminary
evidence suggests very sizeable potential work disincentives after the normal

retirement age because of a sharp decline in pension benefit accrual. We will
also focus on the particular plan features having the greatest effect on accrual

profiles. Plans with non—earnings related benefit formulas as well as plans
with early and normal retirement supplemental benefits will also be studied.

Given the appropriate data, we wish to investigate the relationship between

individual earnings profiles and associated pension plans. In particular, we
would like to know the extent to which wages adjust in accordance with pension

plan provisions. A second important issue is the extent to which pension
accrual patterns affect retirement decisions as well as turnover prior to
vesting, early retirement, and normal retirement.
