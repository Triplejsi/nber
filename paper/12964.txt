The Effect of Nicotine Replacement Therapy Advertising on Youth Smoking

NBER Working Paper No. 12964
March 2007
JEL No. I18
ABSTRACT
This paper examines the effect of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) advertising on youth smoking.
NRT advertising could decrease smoking by informing smokers that the product can make quitting
easier and thus inducing more smokers to try and quit. However, a moral hazard is created because
NRT advertising increases the expectation that cessation is relatively easy. NRT advertising could
thus induce youth to smoke, to smoke more and/or to delay quit attempts. Data from Nielsen Media
Research (Nielsen) and the Monitoring the Future Surveys (MTF) have been used in the empirical
work. The Nielsen data are matched to the MTF data by month, year and market. The availability
of lagged advertising data allow for calculation of an advertising stock variable. The Nielsen data
also measure exposure to national advertising on a local level which allows for use of national advertising
data. An exogenous shock allows for bypassing problems of endogeneity. The results indicate that
NRT advertising has no effect on participation but increases smoking by youth who do smoke. The
elasticity of smoking with respect to NRT advertising is about .10 and the elasticity of smoking with
respect to price is about -1.03. Since average youth smoking is about 5.77 cigarettes per day, an increase
of 10 percent in NRT advertising would increase this average to about 5.82 cigarettes per day. It is
also estimated that a ban on NRT advertising would be equivalent to a 10 percent increase in cigarette
prices.

The Effect of Nicotine Replacement Therapy Advertising
on Youth Smoking
1. Introduction
Over the past 11 years there have been major changes in the availability of
smoking cessation products and in the regulations affecting the marketing of these
products directly to consumers. The main class of products delivers nicotine through a
variety of methods, excluding smoking, and are known as nicotine replacement therapy
(NRT).1 The nicotine delivery systems include inhalers, patches, nasal sprays and
gums. The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approves drugs for prescription sale or
for sale over-the-counter (OTC). Prior to 1996, all NRT products were available only by
prescription and the advertising of all prescription drugs was subject to onerous
disclosure requirements. However, in 1996, nicotine gum and nicotine patches were
approved by the FDA for OTC sale. This change made advertising nicotine gum and
patches possible. Another important change began in 1995 when the FDA initiated a
public comment period on lowering the disclosure requirements for advertising
prescription drugs. It was widely accepted that the change would go into effect and in
the interim the FDA would not pursue violators of the existing law. Prescription drug
makers began to increase their advertising in 1996 in anticipation of the FDA changes.
In 1997, the FDA formally reduced the disclosure requirements for direct to consumer
advertising of prescription drugs.
Although NRT advertising has increased dramatically since 1996, little is known
about its effect on smoking. This paper examines the effect of NRT advertising on

exposition, NRT advertising refers to both Zyban advertising and NRT advertising.

youth smoking. Over the past 10 years youth smoking has been generally declining.
According to the Monitoring the Future (MTF) survey (Johnston et al., 2006) smoking in
the past 30 days by 12th graders dropped from 33.5 percent in 1995 to 21.6 percent in
2006 paralleling similar declines in smoking among 8th and 10th graders. These
declined are in part due to public policy efforts to reduce the level of smoking. A special
emphasis of these policies has been on youth since few individuals initiate smoking
after age 20. The policies to reduce smoking include the restrictions on advertising and
promotion of tobacco products contained in the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement,
tobacco counteradvertising and large price increase for tobacco. Also, state and local
governments have enacted a variety of clean indoor air regulations, and laws restricting
youth access to tobacco. States have also increased tobacco taxes which reduces the
demand for tobacco especially for youth and have funded a variety of tobacco
counteradvertising programs. A number of studies have examined the effects of these
policies. However, there have been few studies which examine the effect of NRT
advertising on smoking by youth.

2. Prior studies
NRT has been shown to be effective in increasing success in smoking cessation
in experimental settings. An experimental study by Shiffman et al. (2002) examined
smoking cessation rates achieved with NRT in simulated OTC and actual prescription
settings. A sample of over 6,000 smokers were given either OTC gum, OTC patch,
prescription gum or prescription patch. In the OTC setting no intervention was provided.
In the prescription setting, smokers were prescribed gum or patch by their physician.
Biochemically verified continuous smoking abstinence (for the past 28 days) was
2

assessed at six weeks and at six months. OTC success rates were consistently higher
than prescription rates. They conclude that smoking cessation rates achieved with OTC
NRT were as good as those under real-world prescribing conditions. Hughes et al.
(2003) provide a meta-analysis of eight additional studies of the efficacy of OTC NRT.
They also conclude that OTC NRT is effective.
A time series analysis by Hu et al. (2000) examined the effect of NRT sales on
cigarette consumption. They use a national time series of quarterly per capita cigarette
consumption, sales of nicotine gums and patches between 1976 and 1998 and estimate
an autoregressive moving average intervention model. The model indicates that a
0.076% reduction in cigarette consumption is associated with the availability of nicotine
patches after 1992. However, the 1996 shift variable, which was included to account for
OTC availability, is not significant. They argue that there may not have been enough
post 1996 data to have a significant effect.
Cummings and Hyland (2005) present a less optimistic picture of OTC NRT.
They study the effect of NRT on altering population trends in smoking behavior. They
find that fewer than one in five smokers making a quit attempt do so with the benefit of
NRT. Because not enough smokers are using NRT, they conclude that NRT has not
had a measurable impact on influencing population trends in smoking behavior. The
reasons smokers provide for not wanting to use NRT is the cost of NRT and concerns
that it will not work. Cummings and Hyland (2005) argue that the OTC versions of NRT
may have too little nicotine to be effective and that is why Hu et al. found no post 1996
effect and why people may think that OTC NRT is not effective. However, they also
present data from an NRT give-away program in New York City. Over 400,000 people
were called to get free nicotine patches and a follow-up survey six months later found
3

that 33 percent of the patch recipients reported that they were not smoking. Cummings
and Hyland’s findings suggest that NRT sales may have only a limited effect on
smoking behavior. Since advertising, in general, has only a limited effect on sales it is
not certain that NRT advertising will have sufficient power to influence smoking.
Iizuka and Jin (2005) examine the effects of NRT advertising on smoking
participation, use and quit attempts. They merge NRT advertising data with data from
the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS). The NRT data is the prior
year’s cumulative expenditure which is linked to the current year smoking data for 73
markets over five years including 1997 to 2001. The use of annual advertising data is
not desirable because of temporal aggregation bias (Leone, 1995). In addition, they
use only spot TV advertising, spot radio and outdoor as the measure of NRT
advertising. This is only approximately three percent of total advertising expenditures.2
In the 12 regressions presented by Iizuka and Jin, NRT advertising is negative and
significant in only two. They conclude that there is no effect of NRT advertising on
smoking. However, they only find that price is negative and significant in three
equations which suggests that there may be specification problems in these
regressions.
Both Cummings and Hyland (2005) and Iizuka and Jin (2005) note the moral
hazard problem associated with NRT advertising. The moral hazard is created since
NRT advertising can increase the expectation that cessation is relatively easy with the
use of NRT. According to Fong (2001) many youth underestimate the addictive power
of smoking. Among high school smokers, only five percent expect to be smoking five

2

According to Avery et al. (2006) in 1999, NRT advertising on TV was about $170 million and in magazines was
about $20 million. Iizuka and Jin (2005) report that local radio, local TV and outdoor NRT advertising in 1999 was
about $5.3 million.

4

years after graduation, however, follow-up data shows that 75 percent will still be
smoking. The moral hazard problem occurs if NRT advertising, which suggests that
quitting can be easy, results in more youth choosing to smoke, to smoke more and to
delay quit attempts.

3. Empirical Model and Data
To develop the empirical model assume that the choice to smoke by adolescents
can be viewed as a multi-period utility maximization problem subject to a cost
constraint. Smoking provides utility but has immediate pecuniary, social and health
costs. Health costs also increase over time. The importance of these future health
costs depend on the youth’s rate of time preference and assessment of the addictive
power of cigarettes. The probability of smoking increases with utility and with
discounting of the future and decreases as the expected difficulty of future cessation
increases. Knowledge about NRT reduces the expected difficulty of future cessation.
This could increase current smoking. Knowledge about NRT would lead to increased
use of NRT and decrease future smoking. Thus knowledge about NRT has no a priori
expectation in general. A demand for cigarettes, Cij, can be derived from this theoretical
utility maximization model. Knowledge about NRT is measured by NRT advertising.
Let i stand for the individual, j stand for the local area and t stand for time. This demand
function is:
Cijt = f(NRT Advertisingjt, Cigarette Pricejt, Incomeijt, Demographicsij,)
The data set employed to estimate this equation was created by merging data
obtained through the Youth Smoking and the Media study (supported by the National
Cancer Institute) from Nielsen Media Research (Nielsen), data from ImpacTeen
5

(supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation), and data from the Monitoring the
Future (MTF) Surveys (supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse). Nielsen
provided the NRT advertising data and ImpacTeen provided the data on tobacco prices.
The MTF data include variables measuring smoking, demographics and certain youth
characteristics. The data are a pool of cross sections of 8th graders, 10th graders and
12th graders from 1994 to 2003. This pool is a nationally representative sample of over
200,000 high school students. Pooling these years increases the variance in
advertising and tobacco policy variables.
The advertising data measures potential audience exposure to all NRT
advertising on network and cable television for the largest 50 media markets in the US.3
These 50 markets accounted for about 60% of American viewing households (Nielsen
Media Research, 2002). Data for each commercial occurrence were aggregated by
market and month. Nielsen data are based on individual ratings of television programs,
obtained by monitoring household audiences across media markets. Ratings provide
an estimate of the percentage of households with televisions watching a program or
advertisement in a media market over a specified time interval. Advertising is measured
by Gross Ratings Points (GRP), which is an estimate of the reach times the frequency
of advertising. Reach is defined as the percent of the potential market which has
viewed an ad and frequency is the number of times an average viewer has seen the ad.
For example, if a market has 80 GRPs for a given month it can be interpreted to mean
that 80% of the market has seen one ad or that 40 percent of the market has seen two
ads, etc. GRPs represent a probability of individual exposure to an advertisement.4
3

Only 50 markets were available for the entire sample period.
Teenage Targeted Rating Points (TRP) were also available but produced the same results in the regressions as
GRPs. GPRs were used in the reported results since teens can also view ads that are not targeted to them.

4

6

The GRPs for all NRT advertising, by market and by month, are aggregated to create
the advertising data.
As a measure of advertising, GRPs have an advantage over advertising
expenditures. The advantage of GRPs is that they measure the impact of national TV
advertising on the local level. The local level is a designated market area (DMA) which
is defined by Nielsen and is similar to the concept of a metropolitan statistical area used
by the US government. National TV expenditures have no reported local variation.
Local variation in expenditures are limited to spot TV advertising, spot radio and
outdoor. National TV NRT advertising expenditures represent about 80 percent of total
NRT advertising while spot media represent about five percent of total NRT advertising
expenditures. In this paper, the use of GRPs to measure NRT advertising improves on
expenditures since GRPs measure the impact of 80 percent of total advertising on the
DMA level.
The ImpacTeen data on cigarette prices is the real price (using the 1982-1984
Consumer Price Index) of a pack of cigarettes which is the state average for the first six
months of each year excluding generics.
Since the MTF data include many youth who do not smoke, the smoking
equation is estimated using a two-part specification. The demand for cigarettes is
divided into a decision to smoke, which is defined as participation, and a decision on
how much to smoke, given participation, which is defined as use. Participation may be
more accurate since it is easier for a respondent to recall whether or not they smoked
rather than how much they smoked. Participation is measured with an indicator variable
and use, given participation, is measured by a continuous variable. The participation
equation is estimated with probit and the use given participation is estimated with OLS.
7

The use variable is converted to its natural log. Both participation and use equations
are non-linear specifications which allow for a diminishing marginal product of NRT
advertising.
The MTF data allows for definition of a set of demographic and other
independent variables. Several dichotomous independent variables were constructed.
These variables are defined as equal to one if the individual is a member of the group
defined by the variable name. These variables are male, white, African American,
Hispanic, 10th grade and 12th grade. An additional dichotomous variable, lives with both
parents, is equal to one if the condition is true. Additional continuous variables from the
MTF are student’s real earned income (using 1982-1984 Consumer Price Index) and
years of parent education, averaged for both parents, if available. The regressions also
include dichotomous year variables, month variables and some regressions include
either state, or DMA dichotomous variables.
The advertising data and ImpacTeen data were merged with individual level data
from the MTF. The individual data is coded by month, year and school zip code in the
MTF. Similarly the Nielsen advertising data is available by month, year and DMA, which
can be matched to zip codes. In addition, advertising data for a number of prior months
is also available by month, year and DMA. The individual data and advertising data can
thus be matched by month, year and DMA along with several months of prior
advertising data.
Measuring advertising by month is important since it minimizes temporal
aggregation bias. This bias results from the length of the time interval used to measure
the advertising data. Aggregation over a long interval will obscure important variance in
the advertising variable. A review paper by Leone (1995) finds the effects of advertising
8

do not linger more than six to nine months which makes aggregation over intervals of
more than nine months likely to create bias. Advertising data used in this paper is
measured in monthly intervals which minimizes this bias.
A related issue in estimating the effects of advertising is accounting for the
lagged effects of advertising. These lagged effects result in a stock of advertising. The
advertising variable used in this study is defined as a weighted sum of current and
lagged advertising data. The lag period is one month. The weights used depend on the
carryover effect. The carryover effect is the ratio of the effect of last month’s advertising
on consumption to the effect of this month’s advertising on consumption. The carryover
effect is assumed to be constant and is referred to as λ. This assumption creates an
exponential decay process. The weights are thus λt where t is the number of months
since the advertisement was aired. Pollay et al. (1996) conclude that for tobacco a
carryover effect of .3 is a reasonable value.5 The advertising variable used in this study
was created by summing the current month and three prior months advertising,
weighted by .3t . That is, the advertising stock variable is equal to the current month
advertising and the weighted GRPs for the past three months. The current month is the
month of the MTF survey data. The mean values for all of the variables used in the
regressions are presented in table 1.
An important issue in advertising research is endogeneity between consumption
and advertising. NRT advertisers might spend more in DMA’s with more smokers. The
number of smokers of all ages is positively correlated with the number of youth
smokers. Therefore, it is possible that youth smoking is a causal factor on NRT

5

Other decay rates were tested and produced very similar regression results. With a decay rate of .3, after three
months the weight is only .027 which make a negligible contribution to the advertising stock.

advertising. However, there was an exogenous shock in NRT advertising in 1996. This
shock, described in the introduction, was the result of the shift to OTC and the lowering
of the disclosure requirements for DTC advertising of all prescription drugs. The
monthly data on NRT advertising for all 50 DMAs are shown in figure 1. As seen in
figure 1, there is a dramatic change in NRT advertising beginning in March 1996. Since
this change is exogenous to smoking, endogeneity is not a problem in the immediate
pre-shock and post-shock periods. However, the greater the elapse of time before or
after the shock increases the probability of endogeneity. There was no NRT advertising
pre-shock, but endogeneity can still occur in the post-shock period. To limit advertising
variance primarily to the 1996 exogenous shock, models using only 1994 through 1997
data were also estimated.
Figure 1 also shows a seasonal pattern of increased NRT advertising around
January of each year. For this reason, month level dichotomous variables are also
included in the regressions. The MTF surveys are all done from February to June so
month variables for March through June were included.
It is possible that within geographical groups there exists unobservable factors
which are correlated across all individuals. This creates a potential correlation in the
error terms for individuals in the same geographical group. To correct this clustered
standard errors are used. The cluster is defined at the DMA level.
The regression models also control for a series of alternative fixed effects. All
models include time fixed effects that capture unobserved national trends and timevarying factors common to states or DMAs. Cross sectional fixed effects models are
also important since the correlation between NRT advertising and smoking may simply

10

reflect the contemporaneous effects of some other unobserved factors such as local
sentiment towards smoking.
4. Results
Table 2 presents the estimation results for both smoking participation and use.
The participation regressions are estimated using probit and the use regressions are
estimated with OLS using the natural log of use. Equations 1, 2 and 3, respectively,
include no fixed effects, state fixed effects variables and DMA fixed effects variables.
All equations include year fixed effects variables. The coefficients of the fixed effects
variables are not presented in table 2 in order to simplify the table. All of these
equations use DMA level clustered standard errors to compute the significance tests.
The alternative fixed effects models show how the estimates for NRT advertising
and cigarette price are affected by the inclusion of controls for geographic
unobservables. The NRT advertising variable and the price variable may have a
component which varies systematically with location making these variables, in part,
proxies for local level unobservables. If this is the case, the exclusion of the fixed
effects variables would bias the coefficients of the NRT advertising and price variables.
However, the inclusion of locational fixed effects variables could create colinearity with
the NRT advertising variable or the price variable. This colinearity can bias the
standard errors. When a variable is significant in both regressions with and without
locational fixed effects it is less likely to be the result of colinearity between the NRT
advertising and the locational fixed effects variables or between price and the locational
fixed effects variables. If this is the case then the coefficients from the fixed effects
models are preferred since locational effects are controlled.

11

The inclusion of locational fixed effects variables is equivalent to aggregation of
the data to the level of the fixed effects variables. The DMA locational fixed effects
variables aggregate the data to the DMA level. The results for NRT advertising from the
models with DMA locational fixed effects variables are preferred since NRT is measured
at the DMA level. However, the cigarette price variable will have the same value for
several values of the dependent variable. This will create a lower t-value for the price
coefficient in the DMA regression than price would have in the state level fixed effects
regression. Thus the results for price from models with state level fixed effects are
preferred to the results from the DMA level fixed effects models.
In table 2 the results for NRT advertising differ between the participation
regressions and the use regressions. The NRT advertising variable is insignificant in
each participation regression. For use, NRT advertising is significant in the model with
no locational fixed effects and the state fixed effects model. NRT advertising in the
DMA level fixed effects model is positive but not significant. The magnitude of the
coefficients declines in the fixed effects model suggesting that the NRT advertising
variable is picking up some locational variation. These results provide evidence that
NRT advertising does not affect smoking participation by youth. However, there is
evidence that NRT advertising does increase the amount of smoking by youth who
already smoke.
The cigarette price variable is negative and generally significant. The state
cigarette price is negative in all regressions and significant in five of six regressions in
table 2. The insignificant coefficient is in the DMA level fixed effects regression which is
unimportant since the price varies at the state level. The evidence suggests a negative
effect of price on both participation and use.
12

Endogeneity was limited by an exogenous shock in NRT advertising. However,
in the post-shock period endogeneity can again become a concern. Once NRT
advertising was allowed, advertisers may target advertising to smokers which would
create endogeneity in the post-shock period. The further away from the shock, the
greater the concern over endogeneity. The least amount of endogeneity occurs when
using data very close to the shock since the variation in advertising is primarily related
to the shock. In order to examine the results presented in table 2 for endogeneity in the
post-shock period, an additional set of models have been estimated for a limited time
period. This time period includes the two years before and two years after the
exogenous shock in 1996. That is, the data are limited to 1994 through 1997. Any
endogeneity between NRT advertising and smoking would be minimized in this
relatively small period around the shock. There are five months of data in each year
and 50 DMAs resulting in approximately 1000 NRT advertising data points in this
experiment. Results from the limited time period models are presented in table 3.
The results in table 3 again show that there is no effect of NRT advertising on
participation but NRT advertising is again found to have positive and significant effect
on use. The magnitude of the NRT advertising coefficients increase in the limited time
period models while the coefficients of the individual characteristics do not change
significantly between the sample periods. This is what would occur if NRT advertising
were correlated with the error term but the other independent variables were not. The
implication is that there is endogeneity between NRT advertising and smoking in the
post-shock period. The NRT advertising coefficients from the limited period presented

13

in table 3 are thus preferred to those of table 2.6
The demographic variables in both table 2 and 3 follow patterns that are familiar
from prior research. These individual level variables are generally not affected by
alternative fixed effects specifications. This shows no location aspect to the individual
level variables. Student income has a positive effect on both participation and use.
Males have lower participation but a higher level of use than females. African
Americans and Hispanics have both lower participation and use relative to the omitted
group. However, whites have higher participation and use relative to the omitted group.
Parental education has a negative effect on use. Finally, participation and use
increases as the student advances to higher grades. The month variables are mixed,
with some significant and some insignificant coefficients.
Table 4 presents the NRT advertising coefficients from a series of regressions
which were limited to data for specific demographic groups. These results are based on
data from 1994 to 1997. The table presents only the NRT advertising coefficients since
other variables where substantially the same as table 3. The demographic group is
listed in the first column. Again, the evidence of an effect is stronger when at least two
specifications have significant coefficients. The results suggest that NRT advertising
has a greater impact on 12th graders, whites and the “other” race category. Younger
students, African Americans and Hispanics appear to be unaffected by NRT advertising.
Use by males and females are increased equally by NRT advertising.

5. Conclusions

6

It is also possible that the difference in NRT coefficients may be due to some phenomena other than endogeneity.

14

The purpose of this project was to determine the effect that NRT advertising
has on youth smoking. NRT advertising could decrease smoking by informing smokers
that the product can make quitting easier and thus inducing more smokers to try and
quit. However, a moral hazard is created because NRT advertising increases the
expectation that cessation is relatively easy. NRT advertising, therefore, could induce
individuals to initiate smoking, to smoke more and to delay quit attempts.
There is no theoretical reason that NRT advertising would have a different effect
on participation and use. Yet the results show that NRT advertising has no effect on
participation but increases use. Participation is affected by both initiation and cessation.
Possibly, NRT advertising increases initiation but also increases cessation. This could
result in no overall effect on participation. Alternatively, NRT advertising may simply
have no effect on participation.
Both NRT advertising elasticities and price elasticities can be computed. Using
the results for the DMA fixed effects model of use in table 3 an elasticity of smoking with
respect to NRT advertising can be computed. This elasticity is computed to be .10,
which means that an increase of 10 percent in NRT advertising would increase smoking
by about 1.0 percent.7 Since average youth smoking is about 5.77 cigarettes per day,
an increase of 10 percent in NRT advertising would increase this average to about 5.82
cigarettes per day.
The NRT advertising elasticity can also be used to estimate the effect on youth
smoking of banning all NRT advertising. The relationship between NRT advertising and
youth smoking is likely to be non-linear with the elasticity decreasing as NRT advertising
7
The NRT advertising variable is a weighted sum of the current and past three months of advertising. It can easily
be shown that if advertising in all four months changes by 10 percent, then the weighted sum also changes by 10
percent.

15

increase. The estimated elasticity thus underestimates the effect of eliminating NRT
advertising entirely. A 100 percent decrease in NRT advertising is estimated to reduce
youth smoking by at least 10 percent. This would reduce youth smoking from 5.77
cigarettes per day to about 5.27, or less, cigarettes per day.
As a comparison the price elasticity is also computed from the four relevant price
coefficients in tables 2 and 3. The four price coefficients for participation average to
about -.0014 which results in an elasticity of about -.68. The four price coefficients for
use from average to -.0035 which results in an elasticity of about -.45. The overall
price elasticity is -1.03, while somewhat high, is the price elasticity for youth rather than
adults. The elasticity indicates that a 10 percent increase in price would reduce youth
smoking by about 10 percent. This is the same as a complete elimination of NRT
advertising.
Further research on the effects of NRT advertising on older smokers is important
before any definitive conclusions about NRT advertising are made. NRT advertising
may be important in helping older smokers to quit. If this is the case, to limit the
damage to younger smokers, NRT advertising could be targeted at older smokers by
limiting the type of programming that show NRT ads and by the content of the ads
themselves.
