ABSTRACT
This paper assesses the effects of reducing tariffs under the Doha Round on market access for developing
countries. It shows that for many developing countries, actual preferential access is less generous than
it appears because of low product coverage or complex rules of origin. Thus lowering tariffs under
the multilateral system is likely to lead to a net increase in market access for many developing countries,
with gains in market access offsetting losses from preference erosion. Furthermore, comparing various
tariff-cutting proposals, the research shows that the largest gains in market access are generated by
higher tariff cuts in agriculture.

Will the Doha Round Lead to Preference Erosion?
Mary Amiti and John Romalis*
This paper assesses the effects of reducing tariffs under the Doha Round on market access
for developing countries. It shows that for many developing countries, actual preferential
access is less generous than it appears because of low product coverage or complex rules of
origin. Thus lowering tariffs under the multilateral system is likely to lead to a net increase
in market access for many developing countries, with gains in market access offsetting losses
from preference erosion. Furthermore, comparing various tariff-cutting proposals, the
research shows that the largest gains in market access are generated by higher tariff cuts in
agriculture.
A key issue in the Doha Round, especially for developing countries, is whether multilateral
tariff reductions will adversely affect their market access to developed countries.1 In large
part, this concern stems from the fact that developing countries were given nonreciprocal
preferential access to developed countries’ markets in the 1970s. These preferences entitle
developing countries to export their products to developed countries at lower tariff rates than
those applied to other World Trade Organization (WTO) members and, in some cases, at zero
tariff rates. If tariff cuts were to be granted to all WTO members under the Doha Round, then
the relative advantage of developing countries’ exports to developed countries would be
reduced due to the erosion of these “preference margins” – the difference between the tariff
rate for all WTO members and their own under their preferential access. However, offsetting
these losses of preference erosion are the gains in market access due to tariff cuts on goods
that do not receive preferences. The question is whether the gains outweigh the losses.
Using detailed trade, tariff, and preference information for the United States and the
European Union, this paper assesses the likely effects of reducing tariffs under the Doha
Round on market access for developing countries. A key feature of this is study is the use of
data on preference schemes, with details of which preference schemes different products
were exported to the U.S. and EU markets. This information is essential in assessing the size
of preference erosion as many tariff lines are not eligible for preferences under the
Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), and in many cases countries do not apply for
preferences they are entitled to and end up paying the MFN rate because of complex rules
governing the use of preferences. Thus studies that assume 100 percent utilization rates are
likely to over-estimate the costs of preference erosion.
We estimate changes in market access by simulating changes in the United States and
the European Union’s import demand following cuts in their bound tariff rates under three

different policy scenarios.2 First, we assume that they cut all their tariffs by a uniform rate of
40 percent. Second, we allow the United States and the European Union to exclude sensitive
products from tariff cuts. Third, we assume a higher than 40 percent tariff cut in agriculture,
and a 40 percent tariff cut in manufacturing. These different scenarios are meant to reflect
likely outcomes that have been discussed in the Doha negotiations.
To simulate changes in import demand requires some assumptions about demand and
supply elasticities. We assume the elasticity of substitution across different varieties of
products is equal to 6, as in Romalis (forthcoming).3 Throughout the analysis, the supply
elasticity for developing countries is assumed to be infinite. This enables the focus to be on
the change in demand from the European Union and the United States for developing
countries’ products as a way to measure changes in market access. If, instead, a finite
elasticity were assumed then trade volume responses would be smaller but there would be
terms of trade effects from which some developing countries would benefit. The infinite
elasticity of supply assumption delivers the maximum export revenue effect, both for revenue
gains and losses, but is unlikely to cause a misidentification of winners and losers.4
The results highlight that preferences granted to developing countries are not as
generous as they appear. Some developing countries actually pay higher average tariffs than
developed countries under current preference schemes. For example, the average tariffs
imposed by the United States on non-African least developed countries’ (LDCs’) exports is
13.1 percent compared with only 1.2 percent imposed on developed countries’ exports.
Similarly in the European Union, the average tariff on non-African LDCs is higher, at 5.1
percent, than on developed country exports, at 2.9 percent.
Because a large share of developing countries’ exports do not actually enjoy
preferences in practice, lowering tariffs under the multilateral system is likely to lead to a net
increase in market access. That is, the gains in market access from lower MFN tariffs offset
the losses due to preference erosion for many developing countries. A simulated uniform cut
in tariffs of 40 percent in both the United States and the European Union leads to an increase
in import demand of 2.1 percent averaged across all countries, although the gains are not
uniform across countries or regions. Non-African LDCs enjoy higher than average increases
in demand for their products, of 8.5 percent, and African LDCs experience a loss of 0.1
percent in demand for their products. If the United States and the European Union were to
exclude sensitive products from tariff cuts, the gains in market access for all regional
groupings would be smaller, on average, relative to the uniform cut. Simulations that assume

A bound tariff is the maximum tariff that a country can set, as agreed under WTO negotiations. The
Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) tariff is the tariff rate applied to all WTO member countries that do not receive
special preferences.

Simulations with alternative elasticity of substitution assumptions are also presented to show robustness
of the results.
4
This infinite supply elasticity assumption differs from that made in Subramanian (2003) and
Alexandraki and Lankes (2004) where a supply elasticity of one is assumed and no terms of trade effects are
considered. Their assumptions deliberately bias the results in favor of overstating losses from preference
erosion in order to minimize the risk of overlooking individual countries that might face losses. In addition, they
also assume 100% utilization of preferences.

a higher than 40 percent tariff cut in agriculture, using a tiered formula, together with a 40
percent cut in manufacturing, generate the largest gains for all groups of countries.
I. Research Strategy
To estimate changes in market access, we simulate changes in import demand by the
United States and the European Union following across-the-board tariff reductions. We
assume a Cobb-Douglas utility function in the first tier at the product level, which implies an
elasticity of substitution between goods equal to one. Thus, the total share of expenditure on
each product at the HS 10-digit level, for example shoes, is assumed to be constant. Within
this shoe product group, each country will decide from where to purchase different varieties,
where each country is assumed to produce a different variety. The elasticity of substitution
across these different varieties is assumed to equal 6, thus if the relative price of shoes in one
country increases by one percent, relative demand for its shoes will fall by 6 percent. These
assumptions are based on estimates from Romalis (forthcoming) and are consistent with
other studies, such as Hummels (2001). Simulations with alternative elasticity of substitution
assumptions are also presented to show robustness of the results. Each country’s current
share of EU and U.S. consumption is estimated from the detailed trade data and from the
OECD’s STAN database. The full details of the estimation procedure are provided in
Appendix I.5
We assume that the supply elasticity for developing countries is infinite. This enables
us to focus on the change in demand from the European Union and the United States for
developing countries’ products as a way to measure changes in market access.6 Implicitly,
this implies that all exporting countries will readily respond to the shifts in U.S. and EU
demand stemming from tariff changes under the Doha Round. Of course this is unlikely to be
the case, notably due to supply-side constraints, such as impediments in infrastructure. Thus,
some countries may not necessarily be able to take advantage of increase in demand for their
products if there are infrastructure problems limiting export capacities. However, without
detailed country information on supply constraints by commodity it would be impossible to
incorporate these aspects. To determine how much trade in various commodities will change
would require information on supply capacity and other factors that affect supply, which are
outside the scope of this exercise. Nevertheless, an advantage of the infinite supply elasticity
assumption is that the simulations provide an indication of changes in potential market
access. Since one of the concerns surrounding the next Doha Round is loss in market access
due to preferences erosion, this seems the most appropriate assumption to make. If, instead, a
finite elasticity were assumed, then trade volume responses would be smaller but there would
be terms of trade effects from which some developing countries would benefit. The infinite
5

Note that these numbers are likely to understate the potential gains in market access and the number of
gaining countries since only the ‘intensive margin’ of trade is modeled i.e. if there were no exports of a
particular good from a particular country to the United States or European Union before the tariff cut, there will
also be no exports to those countries following the cut. This is particularly relevant for high-tariff goods where
tariff cuts could lead to changes in the ‘extensive margin’ that are not captured in these simulations.
6
Romalis (2005) finds high supply elasticities, but these estimates were not confined to developing
countries. The effects of other proposals in the Doha Round such as cuts in export subsidies on agricultural
products are not considered here. The focus is on changes in market access resulting from tariff cuts.

elasticity of supply assumption delivers the maximum export revenue effect, both for revenue
gains and losses, but is unlikely to cause a misidentification of winners and losers.7
The relative change in a country’s competitiveness due to tariff cuts is explicitly
modeled. When there are across-the-board tariff cuts, developing countries face two main
effects. First, where developing country goods currently enter tariff-free, a reduction in
bound tariffs must worsen the competitive position of those developing country exports
because tariff reductions reduce the average tariff their competitors face in the U.S. and EU
markets. Thus the demand for these developing countries’ exports falls. Second, where
developing country goods enter U.S. and EU markets at the MFN rate, whether due to the
absence of a preference or an inability to utilize a preference, a reduction in MFN tariffs
improves the competitive position of those developing countries’ exports because it reduces
the tariff imposed on goods where they have a comparative cost advantage. Their position
also improves relative to U.S. and EU domestic producers and relative to exporters to the
United States and European Union that benefit from preferential trade agreements. The
relative demand for developing country exports of these goods increases. The net effect
depends on whether the losses in preference erosion from the first effect outweigh the gains
from tariff cuts due to the second effect.
II. DATA
The study utilizes trade data under various preference schemes. The GSP is a set of
trade preferences granted on a non-reciprocal basis by developed countries to developing
countries. The system was negotiated over the 1964-1971 period with the first major scheme
implemented by the EEC in July 1971, with Japan following suit in August 1971 and the
United States in January 1976 (Baldwin and Murray, 1977). All GSP schemes involve tariff
concessions to a range of developing country exports. Under the current U.S. scheme, for
example, out of a total of 15,467 articles listed in U.S. tariff lines, most developing countries
may export 6,409 articles duty-free, where imports of the same article from most developed
countries would attract a positive tariff (Ozden and Reinhardt, 2002). All countries that
receive preferences from the United States or the European Union or both are labeled LDC or
developing in Table 10 of Appendix II.8 Note that there are many preferences in place other
than the GSP, which are listed in Table 11 of Appendix II. Prominent examples include EU
preferences for African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and U.S. preferences for
African countries under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA).
7

Papers that assume finite supply elasticities also find small losses from preference erosion. In
simulations following a 40 percent cut in MFN rates, Subramanian (2003) finds that losses from preference
erosion for LDCs as a whole are very small and likely to be less than 2 percent of exports, and only two
countries face losses greater than 10 percent of exports. Alexandraki and Lankes (2004) extend this analysis to
middle-income developing countries and also find the overall impact to be small, between 0.5 and 1.2 percent of
total exports, but it could be much higher for a subset of countries that are overwhelmingly export-dependent on
a few products, namely sugar, bananas, and to a lesser extent, textiles. Note, that there could also be further
gains due to productivity improvements due to lower tariffs on inputs. See Amiti and Konings (20005).

The countries marked with an asterisk do not receive preferences from the U.S. All EU members are
labeled 'Developed'.

It is important to utilize actual preference scheme data as many tariff lines are not
eligible for preferences under the GSP, and in many cases countries do not apply for
preferences they are entitled to and end up paying the MFN rate because of complex rules
governing the use of preferences. Product coverage, defined as the ratio of imports that were
eligible to enter under the GSP to total imports, was only 44 percent for LDC beneficiaries of
the United States' GSP scheme (dutiable imports in 2002 were $6.7 billion, of which $2.9
billion were covered by the GSP scheme).9 Within this low product coverage, preference
utilization rates, defined as the ratio of imports that received preferences to total imports
eligible for preferences, by LDC exporters to the United States are high, at 95.8 percent for
the GSP (out of the $2.9 billion of imports eligible for GSP $2.8 billion received preferential
treatment). (See UNCTAD, 2003.)10 In the European Union, although product coverage is
almost 100 percent, preference utilization rates are low. For LDC exporters to the European
Union, preference utilization rates are on average 76 percent for ACP countries and 57
percent on average for non-ACP countries (UNCTAD, 2003). Sometimes preferences are not
utilized because there are other more beneficial preference schemes that developing countries
can apply for. The preference utilization rates for AGOA were over 80 percent in 2002,
however there were sixteen countries that utilized less than 50 percent of the available
AGOA preferences. (See Brenton and Ikezuki, 2004).11
Preferences that are due to be phased in over the next few years are assumed to have
already taken place. This avoids counting gains and losses to LDCs that will come from the
European Union’s phased elimination of tariffs for sugar, rice, and bananas under its
Everything But Arms Program (EBA), the enhancement of the European Union’s GSP
scheme for LDCs, and the phased elimination of EU tariffs on sugar, rice, and banana
imports from ACP countries. It is assumed that LDCs already have tariff-free access to the
European Union for those exports. These tariffs will be reduced or eliminated regardless of
how the Doha Round turns out. Since the focus of this paper is whether a multilateral tariff
reduction resulting from a successful Doha Round itself would lead to preference erosion,
these earlier commitments are taken as given.

Product coverage is much lower when mineral products are excluded (HS Chapters 25-27, mostly oil),
collapsing to 3.9 percent ($1.5 billion out of $3.9 billion of dutiable imports).
10
Previous studies have also identified limitations of GSP. For example, not all developing countries are
included (Baldwin and Murray, 1977). Programs typically exclude products where developing countries have
the greatest comparative advantage (Devault, 1996). Export eligibility ceilings are often binding (Macphee and
Rosenbaum, 1989). The programs impose strict rules of origin requirements (UNCTAD, 2001) and do not
remove non-tariff barriers. Up to 42 countries have temporarily dropped or have been permanently ‘graduated’
by the U.S. at some time since 1976 (Ozden and Reinhardt, 2003). The U.S. has allowed the GSP to lapse on
occasions, including one period in excess of a year, increasing uncertainty for exporters. Mattoo, Roy and
Subramanian (2002) highlight that the stringent rule-of-origin that requires exporters to source certain inputs
from within Africa or the United States severely restricts the potential benefits from the preferences granted
under AGOA.
11
Brenton and Ikezuki (2004) also point out that products that are excluded from AGOA preferences are
high-duty products; and the U.S. is not a major export destination for many AGOA country exports. These low
utilization rates are likely due to high compliance costs such as paperwork and red tape. Francois, Hoekman and
Manchin (2005) find a threshold preference margin of 4 percent below which preference margins are irrelevant
because of these costs.

The tariff cuts in the policy experiments are applied to the bound rates, rather than
directly on MFN rates, as will be the case in the Doha Round. If a tariff is not currently
bound it is assumed to be bound at the current MFN rate, and tariff cuts are then applied.12 If
the new bound rate falls below the MFN rate then the MFN rate is also reduced.13 All tariff
rates are at the most detailed product line available, which includes more than 10,000
different products – this is at the HS 10-digit level for the United States and HS 8-digit level
for the European Union.14
The study focuses on the effects of tariff cuts by the United States and the European
Union.15 Although this does not capture the total effects of trade liberalization under the
Doha Round, it does incorporate a sizeable share.16 The shares of LDCs’ and other
developing countries’ exports to the United States and the European Union markets
combined are approximately 50 percent, as seen in Table 1. Individual country export shares
to the European Union and United States are provided in Table 10, Appendix II.

Note that over 99 percent of U.S. and EU tariffs are bound (WTO, 2002).
The EU's preferential tariffs for developing countries are reduced using the formulas in European
Commission (2003a).
14
Approximately 10 percent of tariff lines include specific tariffs, which have been converted to ad
valorem equivalent tariffs by UNCTAD in the case of EU tariffs and by dividing actual duty paid by the value
of imports in the case of the United States.
15
The most recent available data for the United States is 2004 and for European Union it is 2003.
16
Thus these results understate the gains from the Doha Round because the simulations do not take
account of tariff cuts by other countries. Yang (2005) points out that African countries can increase their gains
by also seeking greater market access in developing countries as well as making their own liberalization
commitments.

III. RESULTS
Current State of Play
There are many limitations to GSP programs that result in inferior access to developed
markets for some developing countries. First, despite preferences given to LDCs and
developing countries, the average tariffs paid are sometimes higher on developing country
exports. This is due to different commodity composition and different preference schemes.
Table 2 shows that products that are exported by non-African LDCs face higher tariffs (13.1
percent) than products exported to the United States by other developing countries (1.8
percent), which are in turn higher than tariffs on products exported by developed countries
(1.1 percent). The African LDCs enjoy the lowest average tariffs into the U.S. market at 0.1
percent. For each product, defined at the U.S. tariff-line level, the average tariff is calculated
as the value of collected duties divided by the value of imports. Similarly, in the European
Union,17 non-African LDCs face the highest average tariffs but these are much lower at 5.1
percent than those paid in the United States. This difference arises because LDCs enjoy
lower tariffs due to the European Union’s EBA program and due to the European Union’s
program for ACP countries.

product exported by a particular country is a weighted average of the EU MFN tariff for that product and the
lowest tariff that product may be eligible for under various EU preference arrangements. The weight on the
lowest tariff is the preference utilization rate for exports of that product from that country. Detailed preference
utilization rates were obtained from the European Union. Estimated average tariffs for a group of products

developed countries enjoy comparative advantage.18 Despite preferences, products in which
LDCs and other developing countries enjoy a comparative advantage are still highly taxed in
the United States. Table 3 shows average tariffs paid on each region’s comparative advantage
goods on world exports to the United States and European Union. It shows that average
tariffs on LDCs’ comparative advantage goods exported to the United States are higher than
average tariffs paid on developed countries’ comparative advantage goods (3.8 for nonAfrican LDCs and 1.8 percent for African LDCs compared with only 1 percent for developed
countries). However, this is not the case on goods exported to the European Union. The
average tariff paid on African LDCs’ comparative advantage goods exported to the EU
market is on average lower (at 1.1 percent) than on non-African comparative advantage
goods (at 2.3 percent). Other developing country comparative advantage goods exported to
the European Union attracted the highest average tariff of 2.9 percent.

Third, in goods where LDCs have comparative advantage, the average tariff paid by
non-African LDCs is higher than other regional groupings. Table 4 presents average tariffs
by country grouping for goods where the LDCs (both African and non-African) have
comparative advantage, indicated by a Balassa index greater than one. Non-African LDCs,
on average, pay higher average tariffs on these products in the United States and European
Union. In contrast, African LDCs enjoy the lowest tariffs on their comparative advantage
goods in both the U.S. and EU markets. These differences can be explained by the different
preference schemes. Non-African LDCs pay higher than average tariffs on their comparative
advantage goods in the U.S. market mainly because the GSP in the United States applies to
less than 50 percent of imports.19 Conversely, African LDCs pay lower tariffs because they

endogenous, and these are presented only for the purposes of illustrating why developing countries might be

Effects of U.S. and EU Tariff Reductions on All Goods
We conduct three policy experiments to assess the change in import demand arising from
tariff cuts: (i) A uniform tariff reduction of 40 percent on bound rates;20 (ii) Exclusion of
Special Products. Countries will negotiate on the number of tariff lines that will be allowed to
be excluded from tariff cuts, and they will be able to choose which tariff lines to exclude.
Since it is unclear which product lines will be chosen, an exclusion list of 3 percent of the
highest tariff lines is assumed for this simulation; and (iii) A tiered formula for agriculture.
The current proposal is for 5 bands for developed countries, with different tariff cuts to be
applied to different levels of tariffs. Because the actual details have yet to be negotiated, the
simulations here are based on the Harbinson proposal (WTO, 2003), with a 40 percent cut in
tariffs under 20 percent, 50 percent cut in tariffs between 20 percent and 80 percent, and 60
percent cut for tariffs above 80 percent, with a 100 percent cap.21 No tariff lines are excluded
in this simulation.
The results show that gains in market access to the United States and European Union
under a successful conclusion of the Doha Round are likely to more than offset any losses
due to preference erosion for many LDCs and other developing countries.22 Table 5 shows
that on average, all country groupings, except African LDCs, enjoy an increase in combined
market access to the United States and European Union following a 40 percent cut in tariffs.
African LDCs experience a small loss of 0.1 of a percent on average. Non-African LDCs
enjoy the largest percentage increase in access to the combined U.S. and EU markets under
20

It is impossible to know exactly what the tariff cut will be under the next Doha Round. This number is
based on cuts in previous rounds and pre-Doha Round informal discussions.
21
Sebastian, Laborde and Martin (2005) also base their numbers on the Harbinson proposal, with some
variations, arguing that although the proposal was not adopted its transition points are likely to reflect a great
deal of consultations and thought.
22
These results are consistent with Francois, Hoekman and Manchin (2005) that shows the potential
magnitude of preference erosion is reduced due to the high compliance costs of obtaining preferences. In their
policy experiment all OECD members abolish all trade distorting policies.

all policy scenarios presented. The gains in market access for all country groupings are
reduced if exclusion of the highest tariff lines is allowed. The largest gains for all countries
occur with a tiered formula in agriculture (which results in an average tariff reduction of 50
percent in the case of EU tariffs and 47 percent in the case of U.S. tariffs).

A closer examination within the LDC regional group in Table 6 and within the
developing country group in Table 7 reveals that some countries experience net losses in
market access under all policy experiments. For example, Haiti experiences large losses due
to losses in clothing exports. (See also Table 12, Appendix II, for individual country results.)
Sub-Saharan African countries experience a loss in the U.S. market due to losses in mineral
exports, mainly crude petroleum.23 Some countries experience net gains under all policy
experiments, with non-African LDC gains driven by South Asian and other LDC countries,
which experience large gains in clothing exports. Within the developing country grouping,
presented in Table 7, Mexico experiences net losses mainly because of its free trade
agreement with the United States; further tariff cuts by the United States for other countries
will reduce its relative advantage. China and South Asian countries gain from further tariff
cuts because they derive relatively little benefit from existing preferences.

U.S. tariffs on petroleum are 5.25 cents per barrel for light crude oil, 10.5 cents per barrel for heavier
grades of crude oil, and 52.5 cents per barrel for more refined products such as gasoline. Preferences (zero
tariffs) are given to most developing countries (but not to most OPEC members) and to partners of free trade
agreements. So the preference is small, but since oil is by far the biggest export from African LDCs to the
United States, it plays a large part in the simulation results. But it is unlikely that African LDCs would suffer
falls in aggregate petroleum exports in the short term. What is more likely to happen is that U.S. tariff
reductions for other suppliers causes a redirection of petroleum exports since the direction of commodity trade
tends to minimize transport costs plus taxes.

Changing the value of the elasticity of substitution between varieties does not change
the overall message. Changes in market access under alternative demand elasticity
assumptions are presented in Table 8. A higher demand elasticity results in larger gains in
market access. The change in import demand by the European Union and United States
increases from 1.1 percent, when the elasticity of substitution is assumed to equal -3.5, to 4.6
percent when the elasticity of substitution is assumed to be -11. The effect of changing the
elasticity of substitution is to proportionally alter the gains and losses, but in most cases it is
the same countries that experience gains or losses.

Whether a country loses market access following trade liberalization critically depends
on how much of its exports currently benefit from existing preferences. The higher the
current preference margin, the higher the loss from preference erosion, and hence the less
likely that the gains will outweigh the losses. Figure 1 plots the predicted change in U.S.
market access following a 40 percent cut in tariffs with the tiered formula applied to
agriculture for each country against the current average “preference margin”, defined as the
difference between the average tariff rates actually paid on those countries’ exports to the
United States and the MFN tariff rate applicable to those exports. The exporting country
tends to lose market access from general tariff cuts whenever this average preference margin
is 5 percent or above.

An alternative way to calculate average preference margins is to take account of
preferences relative to the domestic U.S. market. This gives an indication of the preferences
that developing countries receive relative to all their competitors, which includes U.S.
domestic producers. When domestic production is taken into account, it becomes clear that
effective preferences are actually quite small and only a small number of countries enjoy
positive preference margins. As can be seen from Figure 2, average preferences measures
that take account of domestic production imply negative preference margins for many
countries. Figure 2 clearly shows that countries with positive preference margins stand to
lose market access from across-the-board tariff cuts as a result of preference erosion. In
contrast, countries with negative preference margins gain because as tariffs fall the price of
U.S. imports relative to domestic production also falls, making developing country exports
more competitive.

Once changes in access to the EU market are also included, Figure 3 shows some more
pronounced market access gains, as well as large projected losses for some countries.
Malawi, Zambia, Barbados, Guyana and Swaziland show substantial market access gains in
agricultural products such as sugar, tobacco, and rice once the EU market is included,
whereas the simulations indicate either no gains or, in some cases, losses in market access to
the United States. Gains in one market may offset losses in another. Argentina, Fiji,
Mauritius and New Zealand are also projected to win substantial gains in access to EU
markets, again driven by agricultural products such as corn, beef, sugar, lamb, fruit, and dairy
products. The simulations show that two small countries, Dominica and St Lucia, experience
large losses in combined market access to the United States and European Union. Both these
countries enjoy exceptionally high preference margins due to preferential arrangements for
their banana exports to the European Union. Banana exports from Dominica to the European
Union were US$7.6m in 2003, equal to 37 percent of its total exports to the European Union
and 32 percent of its total exports to the EU and U.S. markets - 99 percent of Dominica's
banana exports to the European Union enter under preferential arrangements. These banana
exports are reduced to US$2.6 million following tariff cuts of 40 percent in the European
Union. Even more extreme is St. Lucia, which exported bananas worth US$23.7 million
dollars to the European Union in 2003, equal to 89 percent of its aggregate exports to the
European Union and 58 percent of its combined exports to the European Union and United

14

States, with 100 percent of its banana exports to the European Union entering under
preferential arrangements. A 40 percent MFN tariff cut reduces its banana exports to the
European Union to just $8.1 million. In sum, those countries with the highest average
preference margins in the United States and the European Union stand to lose the most
market access through preference erosion, while those with low or moderate average
preference margins are likely to gain market access.

The breakdown of results by product groupings in Table 9 shows that the largest gains
are likely to be in agriculture in the EU market and textiles in the U.S. market. The increase
in market access to the EU market in agriculture for all countries is 13.05 percent; and the
increase in the U.S. market in textiles and clothing is 8.6 percent. However, these gains are
not uniformly distributed. African LDCs lose 9.6 percent in market access to the U.S. market
in textile and clothing and 1.8 percent in the EU market, yet they experience a gain of 1.8
percent in agriculture in the combined U.S. and EU markets. The smallest gains for all
countries are in minerals and other manufacturing categories. Exclusion of the highest 3
percent tariff lines reduces the magnitude of the gains; however, the relative rankings of the
product groupings remain unchanged. A tiered formula in agriculture inflates the gains for all
country groupings.

III. CONCLUSIONS
This paper assesses the likely gains in market access for LDCs and developing countries
following proposals for tariff cuts under the Doha Round. This was analyzed by simulating
changes in import demand by the United States and the European Union, following cuts in
the MFN tariff rates of around 40 percent. In contrast to other studies, our model incorporates
preference utilization rates rather than assuming that preferences are fully utilized. Since
preference utilization rates are as low as 50 percent for some countries, this is an important
contribution in order to avoid over-estimating losses from preference erosion. We take into
account all available tariff, trade, and utilization information for all products.
The results show that a cut in MFN tariffs by the United States and the European Union leads
to improved access to their markets for many developing countries that more than offsets
losses due to preference erosion. The small numbers of developing countries that are likely to
lose market access as a result of multilateral tariff cuts are the ones that receive very large
benefits under existing preference schemes. This result can be explained by noting that
currently many developing countries actually have inferior market access to developed
countries: average tariffs on non-African LDCs’ exports to the United States are higher than
those on developed countries (13.1 percent compared with 1.2 percent). Our results also
suggest that to maximize these net gains in market access, countries should minimize
excluded tariff lines and opt for a tiered formula with higher-than-average tariff cuts in
agriculture.

Appendix I

Appendix I: Technical Information
The detailed steps involved in calculating the change in market access and average
preference margins are as follows.
(1) Change in Market Access
Step 1: Calculate total U.S. imports for each product i in the base period 0 (year 2003).
Denote total imports in the base period M0i=ΣjM0ijp, where Mijp is U.S. imports of product i
from country j that enters under tariff program p. This calculation is performed at the tariffline level (10-digit level).
Step 2: Estimate total U.S. consumption for each product i.
Denote total consumption in the base period C0i=M0i/m:ci, where m:ci is the estimated ratio
of imports to consumption calculated from the OECD’s STAN database of domestic
production, imports and exports. The STAN database includes data for approximately 30
primary and secondary industries and is concorded to each tariff line.
Step 3: Calculate the new tariff rates t1ijp using existing tariff rates t0ijp as the base rates.
The new tariff rates will include a 40 percent tariff cut as the benchmark. In the second set of
simulations 3 percent of the highest tariff rates will be excluded; and in the third set of
simulations a tiered formula will be applied to agriculture with no other exclusions.
Step 4: Estimate new U.S. imports of each product i from each country j under each
import program p.
The utility function is assumed to be Cobb-Douglas, which implies an elasticity of
substitution of one between different goods at the HS 10-digit level. Hence, a fixed
proportion of income is spent on each good.
Within these 10-digit categories, countries produce different varieties. U.S. consumers
allocate their demands across products i. The import quantity demanded for country j goods
under program p is given by maximizing the utility function subject to the budget constraint
q0ijp = p10−ijpσ (1 + t0ijp )

1−σ

Piσ −1Y0i

(1)

where p0ijp is the free-on-board price, t0ijp is the tariff rate, P is the price index of all substitute
varieties and Coi is the expenditure on product i in period 0. Multiplying both sides by p gives
the value of imports in period 0, M0ijp. Analogously, the total quantity of imports demanded
from each country can be written as follows:
18

⎠
⎠

(2)

after substituting in for the price index and incorporating price changes from period 0 to
period 1 that arise from changes in tariffs. Note that C0i − M 0i is expenditure on domestically
produced goods. The elasticity of substitution between different “varieties”, σ, is assumed to
be 6. A “variety” is defined as the interaction of country j product and import program p.
Step 5: Calculate the change in “market access.”
The change in market access is defined as the change in U.S. demand for imports from each
country as ΔMAj=100*(ΣipM1ijp/ ΣipM0ijp - 1).
It is assumed that the export elasticity is infinite, thus the exporting country does not change
its export prices exclusive of tariffs.
Step 6: Repeat the process for EU imports, with some modifications. These modifications
were necessary because the EU data on preference utilization, though detailed, is not as
comprehensive as the U.S. data.
(i) Information on total imports in the base period, M0ij for the EU is available, but not the
imports under different preference programs, M0ijp. Detailed EU preference utilization data
were obtained from the European Union, indicating by 8-digit product and by exporting
country the value of imports that were covered by a tariff preference and the value that
actually entered under a preference. The exact preference scheme was not provided, only
whether the applicable tariff under that preference was zero or positive. It is always assumed
that trade entering under a preference always enters under the most favorable scheme. Thus
M0ijp is estimated from M0ij using this utilization data.
(ii) The analysis assumes that the tariff reductions for sugar, bananas and rice for LDCs
under the European Union’s “Everything But Arms” program has already been implemented
to avoid counting these changes as gains or losses in market access arising from the Doha
Round. This requires a prior adjustment of import values for sugar, bananas and rice in the
base period using a formula equivalent to equation (2) above in Step 4.
(2) Average Preference Margin and Average Preference Margin Including Domestic
Production
The “Average Preference Margin” enjoyed by country j in the U.S. (EU) is simply a
weighted average difference between the tariffs paid on U.S. (EU) imports from country j
19

Appendix I

and the MFN tariff applicable to such imports, where the weights are given by country j’s
trade with the U.S. (EU):

where t0iMFN is the MFN tariff applicable to product i and all other variables are defined in the
Change in Market Access section above.
The “Average Preference Margin Including Domestic Production” enjoyed by country j takes
account of preferential access enjoyed by other producers and the zero tariff paid on U.S.
output sold in the U.S. and EU output sold in the EU:

(2) Identifying the Elasticity of Substitution in Demand
The estimation approach was developed in a paper by John Romalis (forthcoming, REStat).
Demand elasticities are identified by examining where the US and the EU source their
imports of different products before and after the implementation of the Canada-US Free
Trade Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement (collectively referred to as
NAFTA). Changes in US import sources are explained using changes in the tariff preference
afforded to products of North American origin. The idea is that where North American
output is afforded no new preference (where the MFN tariff rate is zero, for instance),
NAFTA's only impact should come through a general equilibrium effect on output prices, or
through reductions in "border effects" due to NAFTA provisions that go beyond tariff
liberalization. For products where NAFTA causes a new preference to open up for North
American goods, the preference should have an additional effect causing US consumers to

20

Appendix I

substitute towards newly preferred goods and away from other sources of supply. This
strategy can be derived from a simple model.

Model Description
Firms produce products under perfectly competitive conditions. Trade is driven by preference
for variety and by products being differentiated by country of origin. Countries may impose
ad-valorem tariffs on imports. Countries may then enter into preferential trading agreements
whereby each country in the agreement lowers tariffs on imports from partner countries but
need not adjust the tariff on imports from other countries. This causes consumers to
substitute towards the output of preferred countries and away from all other sources of
supply, including domestic production. Factor supplies are not explicitly modeled. The model
assumptions are set out in detail below.
1. Products and industries are indexed by i, countries are indexed by j and time by t.
2. In each country j, every industry i produces a product i using an industry-specific factor
under conditions of perfect competition with marginal cost c(qsijt) (henceforth often denoted
as cijt, where qs is industry production. Note that marginal cost depends on the quantity
produced and may vary across producing country and time.
3. In every period consumers in each country are assumed to maximize Cobb-Douglas
preferences over their consumption of the output of each industry, Qijt, with the fraction of
income spent on industry i being bij (Equation (6)). Expenditure shares for each industry are
therefore constant for all prices and incomes. [Note: Equations and Tables are numbered to
follow those already in our paper.]

4. The output of each industry is not a homogeneous good. Although firms in the same
country produce identical goods, production is differentiated by country of origin. Qijt can be
interpreted as a sub-utility function that depends on the quantity of each variety of i
consumed. We choose the CES function with elasticity of substitution σ>1. Let qijj’t denote
the quantity of product i consumed in country j that was produced in country j′. Qijt is defined

5. There are transport costs for international trade. Transport costs are introduced in the
convenient `iceberg' from; gijj’t units must be shipped from country j′ for 1 unit to arrive in
country j; gijj’t=1, ∀j.
6. Tariffs: τijj′t-1 is the ad-valorem tariff imposed on product i imported by country j from
country j′; τijj′t =1, ∀j.

Equilibrium
In equilibrium, consumers maximize utility and firms maximize profits. Because of the
assumption of perfect competition, prices (exclusive of tariffs and transport costs) are equal
to marginal cost, cijt. Consider the consumers in country 1, which we will call the US. Tariffs
and transport costs raise the price paid by US consumers for goods imported from country j
to cijtgi1jtτi1jt. Let Y1t denote US income. US consumers maximize utility subject to
expenditure being equal to income in every period:

∑q

c gi1 jtτ i1 jt = bi1Y1t

Differentiating the Lagrangian for the consumers' constrained optimization problem with
respect to consumption levels of each product, we find that tariffs on imported goods cause
domestic consumers to substitute away from higher-taxed varieties. The amount of
substitution depends on the level of the tariff and on the elasticity of substitution between
varieties:

Equilibrium conditions for all other countries are symmetric, which will be exploited by the
empirical work to control for the effect of unobserved movements in marginal cost that may
be correlated with tariff movements.

Results
We use Equation (9) to derive estimating equations for demand elasticities. Equivalent
equations exist for every other country, specifically, let country 2 be the aggregate of the
twelve countries that were always members of the EU for the sample period 1989-1999:

Using Equations (9) and (10) we can eliminate the marginal cost terms:

(11)

Elimination of the unobserved marginal cost terms is important because relative costs will
shift following trade liberalization. Equation (11) can be transformed into an equation for
Cost including Insurance and Freight (CIF) import values, to match how EU trade data are
collected:

⎠

So long as we only examine countries j and j′ for which the EU does not change its relative
tariffs, ln

τ i 2 j 't
is simply a product fixed effect. Since we do not have detailed transport cost
τ i 2 jt

data for EU trade, to identify σ we assume that relative transport costs of shipping products
g
g
to the US and the EU, ln i1 j 't − ln i 2 j 't , is the sum of a product fixed effect, a year fixed
gi1 jt
gi 2 jt
effect and an error term that is orthogonal to US tariffs. This produces the basic estimating
Equation (13) based on CIF import values, where Di and Dt are full sets of product and year
dummies respectively, while εijj’t is a random disturbance term:

ln

(13)

Now consider country j to be Canada or Mexico and country j′ to be any other country.
NAFTA's increase in the US tariff preferences for Canadian and Mexican goods, ln

τ i1 j 't
,
τ i1 jt

will increase the share of those goods in US consumption relative to their share of EU
consumption. The size of the increased share in an arbitrary industry i depends positively on
the size of the increased US tariff preference, and positively on the elasticity of substitution σ
between varieties of i. The EU was chosen as "country 2" for two main reasons. Firstly, its
detailed trade data is available electronically. Secondly, the European Union is a relatively
large trading partner for Canada and Mexico, which maximizes the number of products that
can be used to estimate demand elasticities and increases the precision of the estimates.

Appendix I

Data
International trade data for almost all of the world is now collected according to the
Harmonized System (HS), a schedule that is standard across countries at the 6-digit level, or
approximately 5,000 products. The US International Trade Commission (USITC) maintains a
database at the 10-digit level (15,000 products) of US imports classified by product, country
of origin, import program, month and port of arrival. Eurostat maintains a similar database
for the EU.
Tariff data is based on either tariff schedules or detailed data on import duties collected. US
tariff schedules for the years 1997 to the current year are available from the USITC. We
extracted US tariff data for 1989 to 1996 from USITC files. US tariffs are almost invariably
set at the HS 8-digit level (10,000 products). Tariffs are aggregated from the HS 8-digit level
to the 6-digit level in two different ways: by taking simple averages; or by taking trade
weighted averages. There are several limitations to using tariff schedules to calculate tariffs.
One limitation is the effect of the maquiladoras on Mexican exports to the US. Under
‘production sharing’ provisions duty does not have to be paid on the US sourced content of
many exports to the US, while the full value of those transactions is recorded in US trade
data. The tariff schedule will therefore often overstate the NAFTA preferences. A second
limitation of the tariff schedule is that preferential tariff arrangements are often
circumscribed by restrictive rules of origin that need to be satisfied to qualify for the tariff
preference. To partly address these limitations we also calculate tariffs using data on actual
import duty paid. The drawback of this approach is that tariff rates can only be observed
when there is trade. Where there is no trade, we revert to the tariff schedule for that item.
This alternative set of 8-digit "applied" tariffs are also aggregated to the 6-digit level using
simple averages and trade weighted averages. This gives a total of four measures of tariffs at
the HS 6-digit level.
Quantitative restrictions on imports of many textile, clothing and footwear products under the
Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) and of many agricultural products provide a further
complication. Many of these restrictions are binding, although a large number are not
(Carolyn Evans and James Harrigan, 2003). They are extremely difficult to account for, since
many restrictions encompass many HS products and most apply bilaterally. The existence of
binding quotas will tend to bias downwards the estimated substitution elasticities.
Eliminating products subject to quotas did not, however, lead to higher substitution elasticity
estimates.
Elasticity of Substitution Estimates
The mean elasticity of substitution is estimated using Equation (13). We use HS 6-digit trade
and tariff data from 1989-1999. Later years are omitted because the Mexico-EU free trade
agreement commenced in 2000. Country j is alternatively Canada or Mexico, country j′ is the
aggregate of all countries that did not substantially change their preferential trade relations
with either the US or the EU between 1989 and 1999. A list of these countries is provided in
Table 13. Four different measures of tariffs are used; depending on whether the tariff
24

Appendix I

schedule or actual duty paid are used to calculate tariffs at the 8-digit level, and on whether
tariffs were aggregated to the 6-digit level using simple averages or trade weights.
Results are reported in Tables 14 and 15. Table 14 reports results based on changes in the
destination of Canadian exports while Table 15 reports results based on the destination of
Mexican exports. The estimates of the mean elasticity of substitution range between 6 and 11
and are reasonably precisely estimated. Moving across the columns, the estimates are slightly
sensitive to the choice of tariff measure - the estimates using Canadian exports are lower
when the tariff schedule is used. The estimates based on Mexican exports tend to be higher
than those based on Canadian exports. The estimates are very similar whether the ‘control’
countries j′ are limited to those listed in Table 13 or include all non-NAFTA countries. The
estimates are similar in magnitude to elasticities estimated by Clausing (2001) and Lai and
Trefler (2002). For the purposes of estimating the market access effects of proposed
multilateral trade liberalization under the Doha Round we choose to use the more
conservative substitution elasticity estimates of 6. Note that in Table 8 we compare how
sensitive these results are to choice of demand elasticity, using the higher estimates of 11 and
an arbitrarily lower estimate of 3.5.

Notes: Dependent variable is ln(US imports from Canada/US imports from control countries) - ln(EU12
imports from Canada/EU12 imports from control countries) by year and HS 6-digit commodity. The
substitution elasticity estimate comes from regressions of this variable on a measure of the tariff preference
that the US gives to goods of Canadian origin. The EU12 includes the 12 countries that were members of
the EU in 1989. The “Table 13” control countries are listed in Table 13. When “All” countries are used as a
control, this includes all countries (including intra-EU international trade) with the exception of NAFTA
countries. Robust standard errors adjusted for clustering on each commodity are in parentheses. There is a
small difference between the number of observations in columns for the same set of control countries
because a small number of observations with extreme values for the calculated tariff preference (where
ln(1+preference) is greater than 0.5) are discarded.
