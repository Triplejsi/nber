Supply Shocks and Monetary Policy Revisited
ABSTRACT

This paper reviews the main issues
that supply shocks pose for the
of monetary policy. A simple version of the Gordon—Phelps model
shows that the necessary condition
for actual real GNP to be maintained
at its equilibrium level in the wake
of a supply shock is for the change
in nominal GNP to
exceed the change in the nominal wage by the change in

conduct

the

income share of the raw material in GP. The required 'wedge
and

between nominal GNP

wage growth can be accomplished by any combina-

tion of monetary accommodation and
this combination a "macroeconomic nominal wage flexibility. Without
externality" occurs, with real CNP
falling below its equilibrju level.

The obstacles to monetary
accommodation are examined in terms of a
taxonomic wage adjustment equation that allows for differing responses
to current inflation, lagged
inflation, and lagged wage change. Monetary accommodation is infeasible when there is full indexation to
current inflation and creates a permanent acceleration of inflation
following a one—time permanent shock when there is indexation to lagged
inflation. With "forward—looking"
expectation formation in the sense of
Taylor, a supply shock is likely to
cause changes in parameters of the
wage adjustment equation as workers attempt to avoid the macroeconomic
externality.
The final section of the paper discusses doctrinal debates that
originated in part from the empirical failures of earlier Phillips
curves that neglected supply shocks.

A macroeconomic supply "disturbance' or "shock" is any event which
creates an autonomous shift in the aggregate supply curve relating the
economywide price level to the level of output or utilization. The autonomous
nature of such shifts distinguishes them from other movements in the supply
curve that represent the consequences of a

current or prior changes in

aggregate demand. The distinction between supply and demand shocks is valid
only with reference to their origin, whereas the

consequences of Supply shocks

for output and inflation depend fundamentally on the aggregate demand policies
that are pursued in their wake.

Autonomous supply disturbances can originate from natural causes,
including a drought that parches the corn or soybean crop, a freeze that
withers the oranges in Florida, or a straying ocean current that nudges the
Peruvian anchovies away from their familiar feeding grounds. Unnatural
sources of supply shocks include the formation of a cartel that constricts the
supply of a raw material like oil, and price controls

that temporarily squeeze

normal profit margins. Persistent changes in the foreign exchange rate have
similar effects to those of supply shocks. While

supply shocks occurred In

earlier eras, e.g., the Napoleonic wars (Joel Mokyr and Gene Savin), their
profound effect on economic analysis and performance

occurred only within the

last decade.

This paper is written almost a decade after the first attempts in 1974 to
develop a theory of policy response to supply shocks.'

It provides a simple

algebraic framework that facilitates a summary of the central issues posed by

supply shocks for macroeconomic policy. Primary emphasis Is placed on the
case for and against monetary accommodation, on the nature and extent of wage
indexation, and on the distinction between

permanent and transitory shocks. A

tight space constraint precludes more than passing mention of cost—oriented

shocks themselves rather than their conse-

influence the magnitude of the

performance. Given the difficult tradeoffs faced by

quences for macroeconomic

represent the best available policy options.

The first line of defense against a

real disturbance is a real policy.

(1982), the U. S. Phillips curve appears to be one of the most stable

on the alleged collapse of the Phillips

scares everyone by crying "wolf" and then flees the scene when it is
discovered that there is no wolf.

Finally, supply shocks have raised the perennial question of the
optimality of decentralized and uncoordinated wage and price setting.

FOOTNOTES

1. Edmund S. Phelps (P. 206) lists the 1974 conferences at which he and
I independently developed what Edward Gramlich later called the "Gordon—Phelps
model."

2. Although it assumes a constant money

supply

and a constant nominal

wage rate, Phelps' paper does include a condition (in the middle of p. 211)
which sets equal the two terms in the parenthesis in (7). Exactly the same
condition as (9) is contained in my 1975(a) paper when it is recognized that
the right—hand term in equation (9) of that paper is the percentage change in
the expenditure share of the external sector.

I discovered after writing this

paper that Stanley Fischer in 1983 developed an analysis that is compatible
with my Part II but is both more complex and more general.

3. The share index is calculated by multiplying total real energy
consumption by the composite energy deflator (both from the Statistical
Abstract of the United States, 1982—83, pp. 572—3), dividing by nominal GNP,
and setting 1972 as the base of the index.

4. Models that combine demand and supply elements include those of Otto
Eckstein, Gordon (1982), and Gordon—King.

Readable descriptions of the role

of supply shocks in the inflation of the 1970s are provided by Alan Blinder.
An evaluation of the 1981—3 disinflation is provided by the three papers in
the volume edited by William Nordhaus.

5. The stability of the inflation equation to changes in sample period
is examined by Gordon and King (p. 218) and related to the Lucas critique (pp.

224—9). Structural shifts in the 20th century prior to 1954 are discussed by
Gordon (1983a) and by Meltzer.
