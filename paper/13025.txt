Consumption Responses to In-Kind Transfers: Evidence from the Introduction of the Food
Stamp Program
Hilary W. Hoynes and Diane Schanzenbach
NBER Working Paper No. 13025
April 2007
JEL No. H31,I38
ABSTRACT
Economists have strong theoretical predictions about how in-kind transfer programs -- such as providing
vouchers for food -- impact consumption. Despite the prominence of the theory, there has been little
empirical work documenting actual responses to in-kind transfers. In this work, we leverage previously
underutilized variation in the date of the county-level original implementation of the Food Stamp Program
in the 1960s and early 1970s. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we employ difference-in-difference
methods to estimate the impact of program availability on food spending, labor supply and family
income. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we find that the introduction of food stamps leads
to a decrease in out of pocket food spending, an increase in overall food expenditures, and a decrease
(although insignificant) in the propensity to take meals out. The results are quite precisely estimated
for total food spending, with less precision in estimating the impacts on out of pocket food costs. We
find evidence of small work disincentive impacts in the PSID, which is confirmed with an analysis
of the 1960, 1970 and 1980 Census.

I. Introduction
Providing assistance to the poor through in-kind transfers such as vouchers for food and
housing garners more political support than providing assistance in cash. Supporters of such policies
believe that providing voucher payments for certain goods (like groceries) will cause recipients to
purchase more of the goods being subsidized, and that recipients will not be able to use public
assistance to buy other, less socially desirable goods (like alcohol or cigarettes). According to
canonical economic theory, though, providing a transfer in-kind should lead to the same outcome as a
similar sized cash transfer as long as program participants are inframarginal. As a result, depending
on consumer preferences the provision of in-kind transfers (relative to cash) may have little to no
impact on purchases of the actual goods being subsidized.
Despite strong theoretical predictions about consumer behavior, little empirical evidence has
been brought to bear on the impacts of providing in-kind transfers on consumer purchases.1 The Food
Stamp Program (FSP) is one of the largest transfer programs for the low income population. In 2004,
for example, the program cost $27 billion and served 24 million persons. This compares to
$25 billion for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and $33 billion for the Earned Income Tax
Credit. It has been very difficult for researchers to isolate the causal impact of the FSP on food
spending, nutritional intake, labor supply and other outcomes. Because the program is national, there
is not variation in program parameters (such as stark differences in state benefit levels or eligibility)
that are typically exploited by researchers to measure program impacts. In the absence of
programmatic variation, most researchers have studied the impact of the FSP by comparing food
stamp recipients with eligible non-recipients. Since we would expect participants and nonparticipants to differ in important – and potentially unobservable – ways (Currie 2006) researchers
1

There is a literature that explores the impact of cash transfer programs (Engen and Gruber 2001; Gruber 1997,
2000; Hubbard et al 1995; and Kantor and Fishback 1996) and in-kind transfer programs (Gruber and Yelowitz
1999) on consumption and wealth. This literature is particularly concerned with the insurance element in public
programs and in estimating the impact on precautionary savings and consumption smoothing. More recently, Meyer
and Sullivan (2004) examine the impact of welfare and tax reform on consumption, making the argument that
consumption is an important measure of family well-being that has been largely ignored in the evaluation of transfer
programs (Meyer and Sullivan 2003).

1

have employed a variety of methods to control for selection into the program (see Fraker, 1990, for a
comprehensive review the literature on food stamps and consumption).
In general, the literature has concluded that food stamps increase food purchase among
program participants by a much larger amount than would be predicted by the canonical economic
model. These studies have found that the marginal propensity to consume food out of food stamp
income is about 4 times higher than it is out of cash income (Fraker 1990). As a result, food stamp
benefits worth $100 are thought to cause about a $17-$47 increase in food spending while a cash
transfer of $100 is associated with closer to a $5-$10 increase in food spending. But, as mentioned
above, these results have been based on studies that rely on strong and untested assumptions. In
addition, they are focused on the impact of the type of income, and only indirectly address the more
basic policy question regarding the impact on food spending and other important outcomes of a
sizeable, targeted transfer to the poor.
To measure the impact of the food stamp program in this project, we utilize an
underexploited source of variation: the original introduction of the program across counties.2 There
is tremendous variation in the timing of FSP introduction across counties in the United States—the
earliest county programs were established in 1961 and the last county programs were established in
1975. The FSP started as eight county-level pilot programs and later expanded to 43 counties. This
led to passage of the Food Stamp Act of 1964 which gave local areas the authority to start up FSPs in
their county. This led to a steady increase in FSP adoption over the next ten years. Finally, the 1973
Amendments to the Food Stamp Act mandated that all counties offer FSP by 1975.
Our approach has the appeal of relying on non-marginal changes in incentives faced by
consumers. This “program introduction” research design has been taken in recent analyses of other
social programs such as Head Start (Ludwig and Miller 2007), Medicare (Finkelstein and McKnight
2005), and Title I (Cascio et al., 2006). It is also part of a larger literature examining impacts of the

of the program on birth outcomes.

Great Society and Civil Rights era (for example see Almond, Chay and Greenstone 2006).
We use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to address two important
research questions. First, we use the PSID from 1968-1978 to examine the impact of the FSP on food
consumption. Specifically, we look at expenditures on food spent at home, meals out, food stamp
savings, and total food spending. Second, we examine the FSP as a traditional income support
program—a guaranteed benefit combined with a program phase-out or benefit reduction rate. This
structure is well known to cause a disincentive to work (Moffitt 1983). While the benefit reduction
rate in food stamps is quite low compared to cash welfare programs, standard labor supply models
would predict that food stamps would reduce employment and hours worked. Here, we are able to
augment our main estimates from the PSID with estimates based on the 1960, 1970 and 1980
decennial censuses.
We employ a basic difference-in-difference model where the treatment is at the county level,
with controls for county and year fixed effects and state linear time trends. In this model,
identification requires that there are no contemporaneous county level trends that are correlated with
food stamp introduction and family economic outcomes. We control for possible confounders in two
ways.
First, we examine the determinants of the food stamp program start dates across counties. We
are guided by the historical descriptions of the political landscape around the FSP. Using county
characteristics from the pre-treatment period, we find that earlier food stamp program introduction
occurs in counties that are more populous, urban, black, low income, and with a smaller fraction of
land used in agriculture. While these county characteristics are statistically significant determinants
of county FSP implementation, we find that they explain little of the overall variation in food stamp
implementation. However, ignoring these underlying determinants of county implementation could
lead to spurious findings if counties that implement food stamps earlier are on a different trend than
counties that implement later. Following Acemoglu, Autor and Lyle (2004), we use these results to

3

motivate the inclusion of trends interacted with county pre-treatment characteristics in our regression
models.
Second, food stamp introduction took place during a period of great expansion in programs
for the poor in the United States. To control for the possible coincident expansion of other programs
such as AFDC, Medicaid, Medicare, and social security, we include three measures of annual per
capita county transfer payments (cash public assistance, medical care, and retirement and disability
programs) obtained from Bureau of Economics Analysis Regional Economic Information System
(U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis 2007).
Overall, our results indicate that people behave as the theory predicts. We find that the
introduction of food stamps leads to a decrease in out of pocket food spending, an increase in overall
food expenditures, and a decrease in the propensity to eat meals out at restaurants. The results are
quite precisely estimated for total food spending, with less precision in estimating the impacts on out
of pocket food costs and meals out. Further, we find evidence that the marginal propensity to
consume food out of food stamp income is close to the marginal propensity to consume out of cash
income. The point estimates consistently point to small negative work disincentive effects, although
few parameters are statistically significant. This is confirmed with an analysis of the 1960, 1970 and
1980 Census. The results are robust to many sensitivity tests including adding more fixed effects,
examining subgroups of the sample, and placebo tests on groups not likely to use food stamps.
The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section II presents a history of the food
stamp program. Section III discusses the expected effects of the program and Section IV reviews the
existing literature. Section V describes the data and Section VI presents the methodology. Sections
VII and VIII present our results and Section IX concludes.
II. Introduction of Food Stamp Program
The origins of the modern Food Stamp Program began in 1961 with President Kennedy’s

4

first executive order establishing eight county-level pilot programs.3 The pilot programs were later
expanded to 43 counties in 1962 and 1963. The success with these pilot programs led to the Food
Stamp Act of 1964 (FSA). The FSA gave local areas the authority to start up Food Stamp Programs
(FSP) in their county. As with the current FSP, the program was federally funded and benefit levels
did not vary across areas. In the period following the passage of the FSA, there was a steady stream
of counties initiating food stamp programs. Support for requiring food stamp programs grew due to a
national spotlight on hunger (Berry 1984). This interest culminated in passage of 1973 Amendments
to the Food Stamp Act, which mandated that all counties offer FSP by 1975.
At the time the FSP was introduced and expanded, hunger and nutritional deficiencies were
not uncommon among Americans. For example, a survey of low income families in Texas,
Louisiana, Kentucky, and West Virginia in 1968-1970 found that 15 percent of whites and 37 percent
of blacks had low hemoglobin levels (Eisinger 1998). There were also relatively high rates of
deficiencies in vitamin C, riboflavin and protein. In fact, a CBS documentary entitled “Hunger in
America” which aired in 1968 raised national awareness of the problem and possibly influenced the
policy debate on the FSP (Berry 1984).
It is important to understand the political context in which the FSP was introduced in the U.S.
Prior to the modern day FSP, some counties provided food aid through the commodity distribution
program (CDP).4 The main goal of the CDP was to support farm prices and farm income by
removing surplus commodities from the market. It was seen, however, as inadequate to promote the
nutritional well-being of low income persons and the Citizens’ Board of Inquiry into Hunger and
Malnutrition in the United States declared that “the commodity distribution program is a failure” in
its 1968 report Hunger, U.S.A. (Citizen’s Board of Inquiry 1968). Of the 1,000 poorest counties, onethird offered no food assistance of any kind in 1967. Furthermore, of counties that did offer the
program, the commodities rarely reached a majority of the poor population because of obstacles such

counties that offered the CDP.

as distribution centers that were difficult to reach, the limited range of products and infrequent timing
of the distribution of goods.5 Consequently, debate about moving from the CDP to the FSP pitted
powerful agricultural interests against advocates for the poor (MacDonald 1977, Berry 1984). In
fact, as described in Berry (1984), passage of the 1964 Food Stamp Act was achieved through classic
legislative logrolling. The farm interest coalition (Southern Democrats, Republicans) wanted to pass
an important cotton-wheat subsidy bill while advocates for the poor (Northern Democrats) wanted to
pass the FSA. Neither had majorities, yet they combined forces, supported each others bills, and
both bills passed.
This political history is important because it illustrates that there was significant
heterogeneity across the country in support for the FSP. Remember that the 1964 Act allowed for
counties to voluntarily set up food stamp programs. The above discussion suggests that counties with
strong support for farming interests may adopt FSP later in the period while those with strong
support for the low income population may adopt FSP earlier in the period. Consequently, the food
stamp program introduction may not be completely exogenous. We return to this below.
Figure 1 summarizes the overall pattern of FSP introduction. In particular, the figure plots the
percent of counties offering FSP, where the counties are weighted by their 1970 population. Note
this is not the food stamp caseload, but represents the percent of the national population that lived in
an area offering a FSP. The figure shows that there was a long ramp up period between 1964 and
1975, leading to the eventual universal coverage of the FSP. For example in 1968 about half of the
population lived in counties with FSP and by 1972 this rose to over 80 percent. It is this ramp up
period that forms the basis of our research design.6
It is important to understand the CDP program in order to interpret the magnitude of the FSP
effects. For example, if all food stamp recipients simply moved over from receiving an equal amount
5

The boxes were also difficult to transport: the monthly box of food for a family of 4 weighed almost 95 pounds
(Hunger U.S.A.).

County FSP implementation dates are reported in USDA annual reports on county food stamp caseloads (U.S.
Department of Agriculture, various years).

of commodities, we would not expect to find any impact of the FSP on consumption. On the other
hand, if counties adopting the FSP did not previously have access to the CDP or if the FSP provided
a “larger” or “better” set of consumption choices, then the estimated coefficients would pick up the
effect of the introduction of the program.
The evidence shows that the FSP indeed represents an important “treatment” over and above
the CDP. First, as shown in Figure 2, the FSP caseload quickly overtakes the CDP caseload. In fact,
the CDP was far from universally available prior to the FSP. For example, in 1967 35 percent of
counties (not population-weighted) offered neither FSP nor CDP, 38 percent of counties offered only
a CDP, 21 percent offered only a FSP, and 6 percent of counties offered both a CDP and FSP.7
Second, the CDP provided a very narrow set of commodities—the most frequently available
commodities were flour, cornmeal, rice, dried milk, peanut butter and rolled wheat (Citizens’ Board
of Inquiry, 1968). In contrast, the food stamp benefits can be used to purchase all food items (except
hot foods for immediate consumption, formula and vitamins). Further, the commodities were
distributed infrequently. Finally, analyses of food intake in counties converting from CDP to FSP
found that in its allowing participants to purchase a wide variety of food including fresh meat and
vegetables, the FSP represented an important increase in the quality and quantity of food in
comparison to the CDP (U.S. Congressional Budget Office 1977, Currie and Moretti 2006).
To get more insight into the geographic variation in the ramp-up to a universal FSP, Figure 3
shows the timing of food stamp introduction by county. In the figure, the shading of the counties is
assigned by county FSP start up date—with darker shading denoting an earlier start up date. This
shows a great deal of variation in FSP introduction within and across states. Our basic identification
strategy uses this county level variation in food stamp “treatment.”
To further explore the degree of within state variation in FSP start dates, Figure 4 presents
FSP coverage rates by state for 1961-1975. This figure, as in Figure 1, plots the percent of the
7

Theoretically, counties were not supposed to have both FSP and CDP in place at the same time, but in practice
some places did offer both. We have not been able to find a consistent time series for county participation in the
CDP. Consequently, we are unable to use this information in our empirical analysis.

7

population (in this case in the state) that lives in a county offering food stamps. In some states, such
as Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Massachusetts, and Florida, there was little or no within state variation in
food stamp start dates. Other states such as California, New Mexico, and Minnesota have much
greater within state variation in the food stamp start dates. The figure shows that in most states, the
county level food stamp introduction took place in a narrower period than for the country as a whole.
As discussed above, the 1964 FSA allowed counties to start FSP—but it was voluntary.
Therefore, for our research design to be valid, we need for the assignment of county start up of FSP
to be exogenous. The discussion above suggests that northern, urban counties with large poor
populations were more likely to adopt food stamp programs earlier while southern, rural counties
with strong agricultural interests adopted food stamps later. This systematic variation in food stamp
adoption could lead to spurious estimates of the program impact if those same county characteristics
are associated with differential trends in the outcome variables.
To explore this we compiled characteristics of counties in 1960, on the eve of the first food
stamp pilot programs. We use these “pre” characteristics to predict the date that the county adopted a
food stamp program. The data on county characteristics come from the 1960 City and County Data
Book, which is based on data from the 1960 Census of Population and 1960 Census of Agriculture.
The dependent variable is the month and year of the county’s food stamp start date—expressed as an
index equal to 1 in January 1961, 2 in February 1961, and so on. In some specifications, we omit
from the analysis the initial pilot counties as they were chosen by a different process than the later
counties. In those cases, the dependent variable therefore ranges from 25 (January 1963) to 175 (July
1975). The independent variables include the percent of the 1960 population that lives in an urban
area, is black, is less than 5, is 65 or over, has income less than $3,000 (1959$), the percent of land in
the county that is farmland, and log of the county population. We include the population to capture
the fact that large counties might find the application process less costly relative to the benefits of

8

application. Descriptive statistics for this data are provided in Appendix Table 1.8
The results are presented in Table 1. We present estimates with (columns 2-4) and without
(column 1) state fixed effects. All regressions are weighted by the 1960 county population. Focusing
on the results with state fixed effects, we find that counties that are more populous, urban, black, and
low income implement the FSP earlier. Further, those with a larger share of the population that is
very young or old implement earlier and counties where more of the land is used in farming
implement later. The impacts of county characteristics are smaller (in absolute value) in counties the
South (column 4).
While these regression results show statistically significant impacts of the county
characteristics on the timing of food stamp implementation, the quantitative importance of these
predictors is small and most of the variation remains unexplained. To illustrate this, Figure 5
provides scatter plots of each of six county characteristics (x-axis) against the county FSP
implementation date (y-axis). For guidance, we also provided the univariate linear regression line
(weighted by the county population) for each panel. These figures show that the magnitude of the
association between the county characteristics and the food stamp start date is weak and there is an
enormous amount of variation that is not explained by the characteristics. This is consistent with the
characterization of funding limits controlling the movement of counties off the waiting list to start up
their FSP: “The program was quite in demand, as congressmen wanted to reap the good will and
publicity that accompanied the opening of a new project. At this time there was always a long
waiting list of counties that wanted to join the program. Only funding controlled the growth of the
program as it expanded” (Berry 1984, p. 36-37).
We view the weakness of the fit of the model as a strength when it comes to our
identification approach—in that much of the variation in the implementation of FSP appears to be
8

Further, in this analysis—and in the subsequent analyses of the PSID and Census—we drop observations from
Alaska due to inconsistencies in county definitions across samples and over time. Here we also drop very small
counties (with population less than 1,000) because of missing data and a few counties where the percent of land used
in farming was greater than 100 percent.

9

idiosyncratic. Nonetheless, in order to control for possible differences in trends across counties that is
spuriously correlated with the county treatment effect, we follow Acemoglu et al. (2004) and all of
our regressions include interactions of these 1960 pre-treatment county characteristics with time
trends.9
This period of FSP introduction took place as part of the much larger federal “war on
poverty.” For example, this period included the introduction of Medicaid, Medicare, Head Start and
the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). Further, AFDC, social
security and disability income programs expanded. If these programs are mainly varying at the state
level then our controls for state linear time trends or state-year fixed effects should absorb these
program impacts. However, to control for the possible coincident expansion of other programs, we
also include annual measures of county per capita transfer payments for cash income support,
medical care, and retirement and disability programs.10
III. Expected Effects of Food Stamp Introduction
The current Food Stamp program provides a benefit to eligible families which is the
difference between the cost of a family-size adjusted “thrifty food plan” (e.g. the guarantee in
transfer program parlance) and the amount a family can afford to spend on food. In this scenario, as
understood in the canonical Southworth (1945) model and illustrated in Figure 6, the original budget
line reflects the tradeoff between food and all other goods, and is shifted out horizontally by the
amount of food stamps received (labeled here as BF). The basic prediction of this transfer is that
overall spending on food and other goods will increase as shown by the illustrated optimal points C0*
and C1* in the Figure 6(b). Out of pocket food expenses are expected to decrease (here the decrease
is F2−F0 ). Consequently, the increase in food consumption, shown here as F1−F0, is less than the
increase in food stamps BF. It is possible, that a household that has a high demand for non-food
9

Another approach might be to use these estimates to form propensity scores for matching counties. However, the
weak fit of the model renders this less appealing.
10
We have no documentation that any of these programs had the county roll out feature that provides the basis for
our identification of the FSP. With respect to other nutrition programs, the National School Lunch Program had long
been established, having started in 1946, and WIC was implemented more universally in 1972.

10

relative to food might, as shown in Figure 6(c), might be constrained by the in kind nature of food
stamps (relative to a cash transfer) and would locate at the kink. For these families, food stamps
would lead to a larger increase in food consumption than an equivalent transfer in cash.11
Prior to 1979 (and during the time period studied here), families had to make a cash up front
payment to receive the food stamp benefits. This feature, called the “purchase requirement” did not
change the magnitude of the benefits a family received.12 Figure 7 shows the budget constraint in
this case, where the amount of the purchase requirement is P. Note that the sloped part of the budget
constraint is still shifted outward by the food stamp benefit (again BF) but the top is censored and the
attainable budget set is smaller. That is, a participant can no longer choose any consumption bundles
that would have them spending more than their total income (Y) minus P.13 This means that there
will likely be more people consuming at the kink in the budget constraint under the purchase
requirement program than under the current program. This suggests that in our analysis (when the
purchase requirement was in place), the impact of food stamps on food spending will be somewhat
larger than it would be under current (no purchase requirement) program or under a cash transfer
scheme.14
The focus of the paper is testing these predictions for consumption. The PSID provides
several measures of food expenditures—cash outlays for food at home, food bought with food stamps
and food away from home—that in theory respond in different manners to the food stamp program.15
Clearly food bought with food stamps should increase after the introduction of the program and cash
11

Implicit in Figure 6 is the assumption that relative prices of food to nonfood are unchanged with the FSP. While it
seems possible that the FSP could have led to increases in food prices (through increases in demand among the low
income population) we have no data to test this hypothesis. As is typical in household survey data, in the PSID we
measure expenditures not consumption.
12
That is, if the family was deemed able to afford to spend $100 on food, but the cost of the thrifty food plan was
$300, the family could purchase $300 in food stamps for the cash price of $100. Today, a similar family would
receive simply receive $200 in food stamps and would not have to outlay any cash.
13
Of course, a potential recipient would choose not to participate in the program if they would prefer to consume
such a bundle to the consumption bundle at the kinked part of the budget constraint.
14
Beginning in 1971, participants could purchase their food stamp benefits in increments of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00 of
their full food stamp allotment (MacDonald 1977). They could make these purchases every 2 weeks. This “variable
purchase option,” as shown in Figure 7(c) will reduce the number of families at the kink.
15
Food bought with food stamps is the value of food bought less the price paid for the stamps. So it is the “benefit”
or “bonus value” from participating in food stamps.

11

outlays for food at home should decrease. The prediction for spending on meals away from home is
ambiguous given the positive income effect (due to the income transfer) and negative substitution
effect (due to the reduction in the price of food at home). Given this low income population and high
subsidy to food at home, we expect that the FSP will lead to a decrease in meals out. Finally, we
expect an increase in total food consumed from all sources—deriving from higher total cash plus
food stamp income under food stamps and the distortion of consumption toward food for those
consuming at or near the kink point. Unfortunately, the PSID does not provide the data necessary to
test the prediction that FSP leads to an increase in nonfood expenditures.16
We also estimate the impact of the FSP on labor supply and family cash income. Like other
means-tested programs, the FSP alters the household’s labor-leisure tradeoff increasing total income
conditional on hours worked. In particular, the food stamp benefit is largest at zero hours of work,
and benefits are reduced for each additional dollar earned (although at 30 percent the tax rate is much
lower than typical tax rates under welfare programs). The combination of the income effect of the
benefit as well as the substitution effect from the benefit reduction rate leads, unambiguously, to a
predicted decline in employment, hours worked, and (if wages are fixed) earnings. In addition,
family cash income (which as measured does not include food stamp benefits) would also be
predicted to fall. We explore the possible work disincentives in the PSID by examining impacts on
head’s employment, annual hours, earnings, and family income.17
IV. Literature Review
A large literature, mostly using data from more than 20 years ago, focuses on whether the
FSP leads to larger increases in food spending than a similar sized cash transfer. However, the

16

Depending on the year, the PSID sometimes includes expenditures on rent, utilities, tobacco and alcohol.
Unfortunately, there are not enough years of data to implement our research design.
17
Given the outward shift in the budget set and the expected increase in food consumption, we would also expect
that the introduction of the FSP would lead to improvements in health. In an earlier version of the paper, we
examined impacts on health outcome using the PSID variable on head’s missed work due to illness. We concluded
that this measure is too crude to capture any impacts as those models were very imprecisely estimated. Almond et al.
(2006) estimate the impacts of the FSP on birth outcomes and infant mortality for the US as a whole and Currie and
Moretti 2006 use natality data from California to examine impacts on birth outcomes.

12

available variation that can be used to identify the impact is limited. Most of the observational studies
in the literature (described in Fraker, 1990, and Levedahl, 1995) estimate the marginal propensity to
consume food using the following linear specification:
(1)

fspendi = β 0 + β1cashi + β 2 fstampi + Z iγ + ε i

where fspendi is expenditure on food for household i, cashi and fstampi are income in cash and
from food stamps, respectively, Z i is a vector of covariates such as household size and age/gender
makeup, and ε i is a normal disturbance term. Variants on this standard specification include the
“semi-log specification” which replaces cash with ln(cash) (food stamps, though, are typically still
estimated in levels) or a “double-log specification” in which ln(fspend) is the dependent variable.
Here the primary impact of the food stamp program is measured as the increased consumption out of
food stamps compared to cash income, as measured by the differences in estimated coefficients by
income type in equation (1).
Fraker (1990), in a summary of the literature, reports that most of the food stamp literature
finds that the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) food out of food stamps is 2-10 times higher
than out of cash income and can easily reject the null hypothesis that β 2 = β1 , even when the
samples are restricted to only food stamp recipients who spend more on food than their food stamps
are worth. The median study in Fraker’s literature review reports a marginal propensity to consume
food out of food stamp income that is 3.8 times as large as that from cash income.18 These findings
are often interpreted as evidence that food stamps increase food spending by more than an equivalent
cash-transfer system would.
The literature suffers from many of the standard shortcomings of observational studies. For
example, most of the estimates were identified from differences between food stamp recipients and
equally low-income families that were eligible for food stamps but for some unobservable reasons
18

The MPC out of cash is estimated to be 0.03-0.17 (with most estimates between 0.05 and 0.10), and the MPC out
of food stamps is estimated to be 0.17-0.47.

13

chose not to enroll in the program (such as a preference to consume non-food goods). In this case, a
comparison between participants and non-participants may overstate the impact of the program.
Other studies compare food stamp recipients to higher-income families who are not eligible for food
stamps. These studies rely strongly on the functional form imposed on income, which may fail to
adequately account for the Engel curve which predicts that spending on food accounts for a larger
share of total spending at very low levels of income. If the nonlinearities in food spending implied
by the Engel curve coincide with income from food stamps, then the estimated coefficient on food
stamp income could be biased (Whitmore 2002). Our identification strategy allows us to better
isolate the impact of food stamps on spending.
Labor supply effects of the FSP have been studied by Fraker and Moffitt (1988), Hagstrom
(1996), and Keane and Moffitt (1998). This prior literature, using more structural estimation
methods, finds insignificant or small work disincentive impacts of the food stamp program. For
example, Moffitt and Fraker find that the FSP reduces hours of work by participants by 1 hour per
week, or since mean weekly hours worked for Food Stamp participants is about 9.5, a 9 percent
reduction.
V. Data
The PSID is a panel data set collected by the Institute for Social Research (ISR) at the
University of Michigan. The PSID began in 1968 with a sample of about 5,000 households
containing 18,000 individuals, and subsequently all members (and descendants) of these original
survey families were re-interviewed annually. The original 1968 sample consists of two subsamples:
a nationally representative subsample of 3,000 households (Survey Research Center subsample) and
a subsample of 1,900 households selected from an existing sample of low income and minority
populations (Survey of Economic Opportunity subsample). To adjust for this nonrandom
composition, the PSID includes weights designed to eliminate biases attributable to the oversampling
of low income groups and to attrition. All results use the weights provided by the PSID.

14

The central focus of the PSID is labor market and demographic variables, containing
substantial detail on income, employment, and family composition. It also includes annual food
(cash) expenditures for food consumed at home, away from home, and food purchased with food
stamps (the value of food purchased less the purchase requirement). These data have been used by
many researchers examining impacts of social programs on consumption (for example see Blundell
and Pistaferri 2003, Gruber 1997, 2000, and Hubbard et al. 1995). In addition, we measure the head’s
employment status, annual hours worked, annual earnings, and total family income.
The public use release of the PSID includes state level identifiers for each year. In addition,
we have obtained county level identifiers for each family in each year through special arrangement
with the ISR.
We use data from interview years 1968 to 1978. We stop the sample in 1978 so that our
entire analysis period is before the end of the purchase requirement (which occurred in 1979). For
our analysis of food consumption, we exclude interview years 1968 and 1973 (although we use all
years 1968-1978 for the analysis of labor supply). We drop 1973 because the food consumption
variables were not included in that survey and we drop 1968 because of inconsistencies in the
definition of the food variables in that year.19 In our main estimates, we also trim observations with
unusual values for food expenditures. In particular, we drop observations where the ratio of food
spending to income exceeds 0.85, where total annual food expenditures were less than $100 (in 2005
dollars) or where annual family income was less than $500 (in 2005 dollars). A test of sensitivity to
these excluded observations is included in Table 8.
There is some ambiguity in what time frame the food variables correspond to. In general, the

19

In particular, the food stamp variable is measured more broadly as food assistance in 1968 and includes
commodity distribution program, food stamp program, and other in-kind benefits. As a consequence, we find
nontrivial food stamp (=food assistance) participation rates in 1968 in counties that do not as of yet have food stamp
programs in place. Further, the cost of meals away from home is defined more broadly than in later years and the
amounts are bracketed.

15

survey is taken in spring and families are asked about “typical food consumption.”20 The PSID then
annualizes this measure and applies it to the prior calendar year. Nonetheless we assume, as other
researchers have, that the food spending variables apply to this year (Blundell and Pistaferi 2003,
Gruber 1997, 2000, Hubbard et al. 1995, and Zeldes 1989). All labor supply, earnings, and income
variables correspond to the prior calendar year.
Unlike virtually all other U.S. public assistance programs there is no categorical eligibility
for the food stamp program. That is, eligibility depends on income and asset tests but it is not
targeted on particular demographic groups, such as single parents with children. Table 2 presents
food stamp participation rates by education, family type and race based on the 1976-78 waves of the
PSID. We use these years because all counties were participating in the program by 1976, but this
period is prior to the elimination of the purchase requirement in 1979.21 These tabulations show that
while food stamp participation is highest among single parent families with children, the
participation is widespread across all demographic groups. For example, among families where the
head has less 12 years of education, 46 percent of single parent families with children, 14 percent of
married couples with children, 14 percent of single nonelderly persons with no children, and 10
percent of single elderly participate in food stamps. The rates are uniformly higher among black
families, with 56 percent of single nonelderly parent families with children (where the head has less
than 12 years of education) participating in food stamps.
To take advantage of the universal nature of the FSP and to increase the power of our
analysis, our base case model includes all families and singles headed by a nonelderly person.22 To
capture their varying risks of being treated, however, in econometric model (below) we multiply the
20

Specifically, spending on food at home and food out were first asked about “weekly” (1968-69), then for “last
year” (1970-76), then finally settled into “annual spending” starting in 1976. Between 1968 and 1974 respondents
were asked to report food stamp receipt “last year,” but it is thought that most respondents answered about their
current status. As a result, starting in 1975 the question was changed to inquire about food stamp receipt “last
month.”
21
The participation rates are very similar when tabulated on the larger sample sizes of the Current Population
Survey in 1980 (the first year in which food stamp information is available).
22
We limit the analysis to the nonelderly because of low take up rates among the elderly (Currie 2003, Haider et al.
2003). The results are qualitatively unchanged when we include the elderly.

16

FSP treatment dummy by a group level food stamp participation rate (Bleakley 2007). Specifically,
we use the 1976-78 PSID to calculate FSP participation rates by education (<12, 12, >12), race
(white, nonwhite), marital status (married, not married) and presence of children (yes, no). We also
present estimates for two sub-samples of the PSID—female headed households with children, and
nonwhite female headed households with children. These samples are chosen because they are most
likely to be impacted by the program.
Descriptive statistics for the consumption sample are presented in Appendix Table 2. There
are a total of 39,623 (person-year) observations in the pooled sample, with 6,002 for all female heads
and 4,501 for nonwhite female heads. All dollar amounts are in 2005 dollars and we use separate
CPIs for food at home and food away from home. The descriptive statistics for the labor supply
sample are presented in Appendix Table 3.
To augment our analysis of the work disincentive effects of the FSP, we also use the
Decennial Census. The challenge is that our identification strategy relies on identifying counties
which we need to assign the FSP treatment. The public release Census microdata, unfortunately, do
not include county identifiers. We instead use county level tabulations of the full census which the
Census Department releases as separate data products. We use these STF (summary tape file) data to
construct county panels for 1960, 1970, and 1980. The limitation of this data is that we can only use
the variables that have been released with the data and that are consistently available over the three
censuses. The outcome variables we examine include: male and female labor force participation
rates and the percent of families with family income in excess $10,000 (in 1979 dollars). These are
aggregate county outcomes and can not be refined for groups most likely to be impacted by the
FSP.23

23

The smallest geographic area identified in the census micro data is the county group. We also estimated models
using the 1970 and 1980 public use micro data IPUMS data (there is no microdata for 1960). The advantage of using
the IPUMS is that we can construct the variables we would like for the treatment groups we like. However, we have
to aggregate the FSP treatment across all counties in the country group. Further, we had to combine county groups to
accommodate the changing county group boundaries between the 1970 and 1980 Census. In the end, this
aggregation was substantial and the results had very low power. The results are available on request.

17

We merge the PSID and Census data using the county identifiers, with 1960 county
characteristics (from the City and County Data Book), annual per capita county transfers (from the
BEA) and the FSP policy variables (from the USDA).
VI. Methodology
Our data discussed above consists of household level data with geographic indicators that
span the period during which the FSP is introduced. By pooling periods, we can control for area and
time fixed effects. This helps to address the concerns arising from the voluntary nature of the FSP
introduction across counties.
Although our identification strategy is based on a person’s county of residence, the
probability of being impacted by the program varies widely across people within a county. Program
participation varies widely with education, race and family type as shown in Table 2. To account for
this variation in program participation, we multiply the food stamp treatment variable–which varies
at the county-by-year level–by a group specific FSP participation rate. This approach has been used
in other recent studies such as Banarjee et al. (2007) and Bleakley (2007). In particular, we estimate
the following model where the unit of observation is the family-year:
(2)

yict = α + δ FSPct Pg + X it β + γ 1Z c 60 ∗ t + γ 2TPct + θ g + θ g ∗ t + ηc + λt + ε ict

where yict is the outcome variable, FSPct is an indicator variable equal to 1 if county c in year t has a
FSP program, Xit are family characteristics, Zc60 are 1960 county characteristics, TPct are per capita
county transfer income variables, ηc are county fixed effects and λt are time fixed effects. (We
estimate additional specifications with state linear time trends and state-year fixed effects.) Pg is the
group (g) specific food stamp participation rate; we use 24 groups defined by race (white, nonwhite),
marital status (married, not married), presence of children (yes, no), and education (<12, 12, >12).
We also include fixed effects for each group and for group interacted with linear time.
The individual controls X include controls for education, race, urban location, state
unemployment rate, and for the food consumption models the log of family cash income. As

18

suggested by Currie (2003), X includes a full set of fixed effects for the number of children and
number of adults in the family to control nonparametrically for the differences in food needs across
families. All estimates are weighted using the PSID family weight and the standard errors are
clustered on county.
We also present estimates that limit the sample to groups that had high participation rates:
unmarried women with children, and the further subset of nonwhite unmarried mothers. In this case,
we do not interact the FSP variable with Pg as in equation (2), and instead estimate the following
model:
(3)

yict = α + δ FSPct + X it β + γ 1Z c 60 ∗ t + γ 2TPct + ηc + λt + ε ict

where all variables are defined as above. These sample restrictions reduce the number of available
observations by more than 80 percent, and generally provide less precise estimates.
In addition, a series of placebo tests are presented in Table 7. These are estimated using the
specification in equation (3), but the sample is limited to groups that have low FSP participation rates
such as high education married couples with children.
As described above, the food variables in the PSID measure expenditures as of the interview
which is fielded in spring of each year. Thus t in (2) and (3) above refers to the interview year. Given
this timing, we set the treatment variable FSPct to 1 if county c has a FSP program in place by
January of year t. When examining the labor supply and income, the variables refer to the calendar
year prior to the interview year. In that case, t refers to the year prior to the interview year and we
define the treatment variable to be 1 if county c has a FSP in place by January of the year prior to the
interview year.24
We include the pre-treatment county variables (Zc60) interacted with linear time trends to
control for the observable determinants of county food stamp adoption (Table 1). The variables in Z

24

There is some evidence (Berry 1984) that it took some time to ramp up the new county FSP programs. We have
explored the sensitivity to lagging the treatment effects and while the specific estimates change somewhat, the
results are qualitatively similar.

19

include the log of the population, the percent of land in farming and the percent of population black,
urban, age less than five, age greater than 65 and with income less than $3,000 each interacted with a
linear time trend. We include the county transfer variables TPct to control for the possible coincident
expansions of other transfer programs during this period. In particular, we include three per capita
annual county transfer income variables: (1) retirement and disability programs, (2) medical care
(Medicare, Medicare, and military health care), and (2) cash public assistance (AFDC, SSI, and
general assistance).
VII. Results for Expenditures on Food
We begin with the overall pooled sample and the estimation approach described in equation
(2). To reflect differing probabilities of being affected by the program, we interact the treatment
dummy with a group specific FSP participation rate. Note that with this interaction, the parameter
estimates represent impacts for families that take up the program (e.g. no post-estimation scaling
needs to be done). The main results, presented in Table 3, provide estimates for three outcome
variables: the log of real expenditures on food at home, a dummy for any meals out, and the log of
real total food expenditures. Expenditures on food at home includes all cash spending on groceries,
but does not include cash outlay for food stamps or the value of food purchased with stamps. The
meals out variable is equal to one if a household reports spending any money on meals out in a
typical week. About three quarters of the pooled sample and only about one-half of single mother
families report any spending on meals out (Appendix Table 2). Finally, total food expenditures
includes money spent on food at home, food out, and also includes food purchased with food stamps
and the value of any other free meals or food that the household received.
We present five specifications. The first specification includes demographics, the 1960
county characteristics interacted with linear time, and year and county fixed effects. In the second
specification we add state linear time trends. In the third we add the per capita county transfer
income variables. In the fourth, we adopt the basic Engel curve specification and control for the log

20

of family (cash) income. We postpone concerns about the possible endogeneity of this variable (due
to work disincentive impacts of the food stamp program) to the next section. In the final
specification, we replace the state linear time trends with state-year fixed effects.
The first panel finds—as predicted by the theory—a small, negative impact of food stamps
on out-of-pocket (cash) spending on food at home. The second panel shows—as expected—a
reduction in purchase of meals out measured as whether a family reports eating any meals out in the
past year. Both of these findings are imprecisely measured, however, and not statistically significant.
Finally, in the third panel, FSP is associated with a statistically significant and robust 18 percent
increase in total expenditures on food. Overall, the results in Table 3 are consistent with the
theoretical predictions but not always statistically significantly so.
In this double-log specification, the coefficient on log of real family cash income (not
reported in the table) estimates a elasticity of food spending with respect to income of 0.30 and
evaluating at means implies a marginal propensity to consume food out of cash income of 0.09. This
is quite consistent with the existing literature (summarized above).
The results show that adding the controls for the county transfer income (column 3), family
income (column 4), or including state-by-year fixed effects (column 5) improve precision and the
overall fit of the model, but make little difference for the parameter estimates.
Table 4 presents the impact of the program on a sample limited to female-headed households
with children. In this case, the first panel displays the impact of the introduction of the program in
one’s county on an individual’s likelihood of receiving any food stamps. The results show
consistently that the introduction of the food stamp program leads to increases in food stamp receipt
(as expected). We can interpret the coefficient as the effective participation rate. Note that these
implied participation rates are somewhat lower than those implied in Table 2 and may be due to a
program ramp up period taking place. Panels B through D present impacts of the program on food
spending at home, meals out, and total food spending. To scale up the results to be per food stamp

21

family, the numbers in italics divide the parameter estimates by the sample mean food stamp
participation.25 As with the pooled results in Table 3, the results for female headed households show
that the introduction of the FSP leads to a large statistically significant increase in total food
expenditures. Again, we have no statistically significant results for meals out or out of pocket
spending on food. Interestingly, the magnitude of the results for total food from the targeted sample
is quite similar to the pooled sample in Table 3. For example, Table 3 shows an 18 percent increase
in total food expenditures with the introduction of the FSP compared to 26-28 percent in the sample
of female heads of household (after scaling up by sample participation rate).
Table 5 further narrows the sample to include only nonwhite female headed households with
children. The results are broadly consistent with the earlier results for the overall sample—negative
and insignificant impacts on meals out and cash expenditures on food at home and positive impacts
on total food—but are typically smaller and less precisely estimated. The overall impact on total
food expenditures is more muted in this sample, with a 6-13 percent increase (after scaling up by
sample participation rate).
In Tables 4 and 5, as well as Table 3, the results are quite consistent across the specifications.
For the remainder of the paper, we adopt as our base specification the specification in column (4)
with state linear time trends, county transfers, and log of family income.
Policy analysts have long been interested in the impact of an additional dollar’s worth of
income on food spending, and whether the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) food varies out of
cash income versus food stamp income. One can make a further adjustment of these estimates to
calculate how the predicted increase in total food expenses compares to the increase in food stamp
benefits. Table 6 presents the estimates of the MPC out of both types of income. These MPCs are
derived from the estimates on treatment dummy and on log(income) in the model of the log of total
food expenditures. All estimates come from the specification in column (4) of Tables 3-5, with
25

As with the earlier use of food stamp participation rates, here we calculate the mean food stamp participation rate
using interview years 1976-1978 representing the period after all counties have adopted the program and before the
purchase requirement is eliminated.

22

controls for county transfer income and state linear time trends. The MPCs are evaluated at the mean
values of food spending and income levels among food stamp recipients. The results in row (1),
based on the pooled sample, indicate an MPC for food out of food stamp income equal to 0.16 and an
MPC for food out of cash income of 0.09. In subsequent rows, we present parameter estimates and
implied MPCs for subgroups with higher probabilities of being impacted by the FSP.26 Consistent
with the Engel curve relationship, as the sample becomes more disadvantaged, the MPC food out of
cash income increases although not dramatically. For example, the MPC food out of cash income
rises from 0.086 in the full sample to 0.111 in the sample restricted to families with income less than
or equal to $25,000 (in 2005 dollars). The MPC food out of food stamps also increases as the sample
becomes more disadvantaged (we will return to this below).27
Returning to the estimates for the full sample in row (1), the results are consistent with the
theoretical predictions—the MPC food out of food stamps is quite close to the MPC food out of cash
income. This would suggest that most households are inframarginal. This is in stark contrast to the
existing literature that finds the MPC food out of food stamps to be 2-10 times larger than the MPC
food out of cash income. The difference between our results and the previous literature comes fully
from our lower estimate of MPC food out of food stamp income, which we feel is the result of our
credible research design. Our estimate of the MPC food out of cash income is estimated from crosssectional variation in cash income – similar to the rest of the literature – and is similar in magnitude
to the older literature.
While close in magnitude (and certainly much closer than the prior literature suggested), we
are still finding that the estimated MPC food out of in-kind transfers (at 0.16) is larger than the MPC
food out of cash income at (0.09). Thus far, we have maintained that the only reason for a higher
26

Estimates in rows (1)-(6) use the pooled model specification in equation (2), and in particular the treatment
dummy is interacted with a group FSP participation rate. Thus the parameter estimates reflect impacts for a treated
person. In rows (7)-(8), there is no interaction with the FSP participation rate. The numbers in italics scale up the
parameters by dividing by the sample FSP participation rate as described in the presentation of Table 4. The MPCs
are directly comparable across samples.
27
As described above, our estimated MPC food out of food stamps is likely to be larger than it would be if our data
corresponded to a period without a purchase requirement.

23

MPC food out of food stamps compared to the MPC food out of cash income is that households are
constrained by the in-kind nature of the program (as illustrated in Figure 6c). There are, however,
other reasons why the MPCs may differ. The family member with control over food stamp benefits
may be different from the person that controls earnings and other cash income. If the person with
control over food stamps has greater preferences for food, then we may find that the MPC food out of
food stamps is higher than the MPC food out of cash income. Alternatively, it is possible that the inkind transfer sets a mental target for how much a family “should” spend on food, and as a result
alters a family’s preferences toward consuming at the budget kink point. Finally, families may
perceive that food stamp benefits are a more permanent source of income compared to earnings.
Returning to Table 6, we find that as the sample becomes more disadvantaged (cutting on
income, education, or race) the MPC food out of food stamps rises relative to the MPC food out of
cash income, suggesting that more of the lowest-income households are located at the kink. This is to
be expected, as the budget constraint is shifted out further for lower-income families because the
absolute level of food stamp transfers is higher for the poorest families. If preferences are constant
between the higher and lower income groups, it is straightforward to show that a larger shift out in
the budget set will lead to a greater likelihood of locating at the kink for the more disadvantaged
sample. Whitmore (2002) found a similar result when comparing responses to food stamp programs
in Alabama and San Diego. Overall, however, while the ratio of the MPCs rises at the highest (for the
sample of nonwhite nonelderly families) to 3.7, most of our estimates imply the ratio is 2.5 or lower.
One should be cautious in interpreting these “marginal” calculations for food stamp income
because of the nonmarginal nature of the research design – i.e. the design compares spending when
there was no program to spending after the program was introduced. On the other hand, the MPC for
income is identified off of cross-sectional variation in cash income, and is subject to the usual
criticisms of this type of identification.
Sensitivity Checks

24

We conducted many specification tests. First, in Table 7 we present placebo tests—that is, we
estimate the models for groups that are not expected to be impacted by the food stamp program. In
these and all other specification tests, we use the model with state linear time trends and controls for
county per capita transfers and log(family cash income). We estimate the models for high income
(more than $50,000 in 2005 dollars) families, high income married couples with children, and white
high educated (college educated or more) families with children. The results, as expected, show no
significant impacts of the FSP on food consumption for any of these groups. In fact, here the point
estimates on our most robustly estimated outcome—total food expenditures—while small is negative
compared to the consistently positive estimates for the likely impacted groups.
Further specification testing is provided in Tables 8 and 9. We present the specification tests
for the pooled sample of all nonelderly in the PSID, with the treatment dummy interacted with the
group specific FS participation rate. (The results are qualitatively the same for the female headed
sample and the nonwhite female headed sample.) Panel A of Table 8 presents estimates where we
drop all observations with minor or major imputations to the food variables. Imputations represent
about one to five percent of observations depending on the variable. Panel B of Table 8 presents
estimates where we add back in the observations that were trimmed from the original dataset because
of unusual food consumption data. The results change little with these changes in sample.
In panel C of Table 8 we test for policy endogeneity by adding a one year lead of the county
FSP implementation. If this were statistically significant, that would suggest that there were
underlying trends in food consumption that are correlated with the county FSP adoption leading to
spurious estimated impacts of FSP. The coefficients on the policy lead variables are small and often
opposite-signed compared to the actual policy variable.28
Table 9 explores the sensitivity of the results to the particular functional form specified.
28

In results not presented here, we also explored whether the treatment effect varies over time by adding an
interaction between the treatment effect and a dummy for 1973 or later. Time varying treatments might result
because the early adopting counties were more enthusiastic about the program than the counties that were forced
into compliance. However, we find no evidence of differences over time. We also estimated models adding back in
the 1968 data. The results, while changing somewhat, provide the same qualitative conclusions.

25

Column (1) of the top panel restates the main results of the paper found in column (4) from Table 3,
estimated as the log of food spending on the availability of the food stamp program along with the
log of income. Subsequent columns experiment with including food spending and cash income in
levels, and including a quadratic in income. To compare the results across specifications, the implied
MPCs out of food stamp and cash income are reported at the bottom of the table. The results of the
introduction of the food stamp program are similar across specifications, although allowing less
curvature in the relationship between cash income and food spending tends to reduce the MPC out of
income. The bottom panel repeats the exercise, limiting the sample to those with relatively low
levels of family income. The estimated MPCs out of food stamp income are larger among the more
targeted group compared to the top panel, and the estimated impact of the program is quite robust
across specifications.
As discussed earlier, the expansion of the food stamp program took place during a time of
great change in the U.S. system of government support. We address this by controlling for the
county level transfer variables. Another, more direct approach, is to examine the impact of the FSP
on family government transfer income. In particular, with the PSID we can measure income of the
head and wife from AFDC, other welfare income (SSI, General Assistance), and social security. The
results of that exercise, presented in Table 10, show no significant impact of the FSP on other sources
of income support.
In sum, the results in this section show that the food stamp program is associated with
increases in total food consumption and (less consistently) decreases in out of pocket food spending.
The results are robust to including state linear time trends, state-year fixed effects, and do not appear
to be the result of other program expansions during this time period.
VIII. Results for Work Disincentive Effects
The FSP has the structure of an income support program. A family is eligible for a given
level of food stamps (“the guarantee”) which decreases as earnings increase. The combination of the

26

income effect of the benefit as well as the substitution effect from the benefit reduction rate leads,
unambiguously, to a predicted decline in employment, hours worked, and (if wages are fixed)
earnings. In addition, family income—which as measured here as cash income and does not include
food stamp benefits—is also expected to fall. It is important to establish whether there are work
disincentives of the program because the impacts of a reduction in earnings may offset gains in
additional food consumption. The prior literature, which is based mostly on structural estimation,
finds little or no impact of the FSP on labor supply. Here we take a very different approach by using
the introduction of food stamps.
PSID results for the full nonelderly sample, as well as female heads and nonwhite female
heads (paralleling Tables 3-5) are presented in Table 11. As above, the parameter estimates in the
pooled models reflect impacts for a “treated” family. For the female headed household samples, we
provide in italics the equivalent scaled estimates (which are equal to the parameter estimates divided
by the sample FSP participation rate). We present estimates for whether the head worked at all last
year, the head’s annual hours last year, the head’s annual earnings last year, and the total family
income. Note that hours and earnings are unconditional measures – that is, they include
nonworkers.29 Thus any impact on hours or earnings will reflect both intensive and extensive labor
margins.
Across all outcomes and all three samples, each of the point estimates is consistent with the
theoretical predictions of decreases in employment, hours, earnings and income. However, few
estimates are statistically significant. There is a large, statistically significant decrease in whether the
head reports any work in the pooled sample, and annual hours worked in the female heads and
nonwhite female heads samples are estimated to decline significantly with food stamp
implementation. The results for annual hours worked suggest a reduction of 12 to 16 percent.
We also examine the impacts on labor supply using decennial Census data. The only public

Family income is specified in log form. Because they include zeros, the head’s earnings are specified in levels.

27

use release of the Census that identifies the county of residence is county-level aggregate files—
known as the STF files. Using that data, we estimate models of labor force participation rates for all
females and males (aged 16 and over), and all females with a child under age six. Lastly, we can
examine the propensity to have family income in excess of 10,000 in real 1979 dollars. We estimate
models similar to those presented above, with decade fixed effects replacing the year fixed effects.
Because the observations are at the county-year level, we do not include any demographic
characteristics and the regression is weighted using the county population. As above, standard errors
are clustered on county. The results are presented in Table 12—with panel A reporting estimates for
all persons and panel B reporting estimates for nonwhites (for variables that are available).
It is important to note that these treatment groups are broader than the targeted samples used
in the PSID and there is no way to weight the treatment by group participation rate (as in our pooled
sample) because the data are county wide averages. With that said, the results show a relatively
statistically precise, small negative estimated work disincentive effect. For example, the estimate for
males shows that implementing a food stamp program leads to a statistically significant 0.003
decrease in the labor force participation rate compared to the mean value of 0.76. In addition, the
probability that overall family cash income (not including food stamps) is less than $10,000 per year
(in 1979 dollars) increases by a statistically significant 1-3 percentage points.
Together, these results suggest that there is a small, negative impact on income and work
associated with the food stamp program. The relative modest size of these effects is perhaps not
surprising given the low (for income support programs) benefit reduction rate of 30% in the food
stamp program. In the AFDC/TANF program where the work disincentive effects are estimated to be
much larger (Moffitt 1992) the benefit reduction rate is closer to 100 percent. However, as a check
and to gauge the magnitude of the expected labor supply effects of the food stamp program, we
simulated the impact of the program on annual hours worked in our PSID sample using estimated
labor supply elasticities from the Negative Income Tax experiments (Robins and West 1983). These

28

simulations show that the food stamp program is expected to lead to about a 100 hour reduction in
annual hours worked among our female heads of household sample (compared to our estimate of a
165 hour reduction in Table 11). Note that the simulations predict only the intensive margin effect,
and are therefore expected to be below our estimates which capture the extensive and intensive
margin impacts. The simulations for the full or pooled sample predicted a 30 hour reduction in hours,
which scaled up by the group FS participation rate represents about a 350 hour reduction in hours
somewhat larger than our (insignificant) estimated 229 reduction in Table 11. Overall, we take this as
a useful exercise which corroborates our estimates of modest work incentive effects in the food
stamp program.30
IX. Conclusion
In this paper we present evidence on the effect of the largest near-cash transfer program –
food stamps – on the consumption and labor supply of the poor. The overall program effects of the
Food Stamp Program have been difficult for researchers to isolate, because there is little cross-state
or over-time program variation to exploit. Here we use county-level variation in the original
adoption of the program from 1963-1975 to identify the impact of food stamps. Using the PSID and
Census data, we find that the FSP significantly increases food consumption, and causes a small
negative impact on work behavior of the poor. By introducing and developing this research design,
the paper provides an important contribution to the literature on evaluating the behavioral impacts of
transfer programs.
Perhaps more importantly, the paper tests the economics of in-kind transfers. Economic
theory has strong predictions about how consumers will reallocate their spending in response to inkind transfers. Despite the well known theoretical predictions, there has been relatively little

30

More specifically, we assign the compensated wage and income effects based on family type (female headed
households are assigned the effects for “single females” and all male headed singles/families are assigned the effects
for “husbands”). We assign maximum food stamp benefits and the food stamp breakeven income level by family
size using the 1975 food stamp parameters in Table 2.2 from MacDonald (1977). We assume no nonlinear response
to the implementation of food stamps and therefore simulate the change in hours for those families with head’s
earnings below the food stamps breakeven point. Full results of simulation available on request.

29

empirical work to test those predictions. We find that the poor react to in-kind transfers by reducing
their out-of-pocket spending on the targeted good, just as theory predicts. But total consumption of
the targeted good from all sources – cash outlays and in-kind transfers – increases. Additionally we
find that, consistent with theory, providing the food stamp benefits in voucher form leads to a
minimal distortion of the consumption choice relative to what it would be if the benefit were
provided in cash. This is in stark contrast to the findings in the existing literature, which use data and
methods from more than two decades ago.
Our findings, then, contribute to the literature in two distinct ways. First, we provide
important and new estimates of the impact of the food stamp program on consumption and labor
supply using a credible research design. Second, we test predictions of the theory of consumer choice
and in particular the differential impacts of cash versus in kind transfers.
Even though there have been changes in the population of the United States and the
parameters of the Food Stamp Program since the period we are studying, these results are relevant for
today’s policy debates. To date, there have been no studies that we have found that provide credible
evidence on the impact of the FSP on consumption and income. The FSP is once again receiving
considerable political attention, and it is crucial from a policy maker’s perspective to be able to
measure the benefits of the program not only on food spending, but also on other outcomes like
income, child well-being, and health.

Notes: The data is at the county level and the dependent variable is equal to the calendar month (normed to 1 in January 1961)
that the county began offering the Food Stamp Program. The control variables come from the City and County Databook for
1960. Alaska counties are dropped due to missing data on the food stamp program. Very small counties (with population less
than 1,000) are dropped because of missing data on some control variables. A small number of counties are dropped because the
variable percent of land in farming exceeds 100 percent. Estimates are weighted using the 1960 county population.

Notes: Each parameter is from a separate regression of the outcome variable on the Food Stamp implementation dummy multiplied by a group
food stamp participation rate. The food stamp implementation dummy equals one if the county-year observation had a food stamp program in
place by January of that year. The group food stamp participation rate is calculated for each education-race-marital status-presence of children
cell using the 1976-1978 PSID. The estimation sample includes all PSID families with nonelderly heads in interview years 1969-1972 and 19741978. There is no food data in 1973 and 1978 is chosen due to the purchase requirement being eliminated is as of 1979. Observations from
Alaska are dropped because of missing data on food stamp program start date and observations with unusual expenditure values are dropped
(annual food expenditures less than $100, annual family income less than $500, or income share on food greater than 0.85). All outcome variables
correspond to annual measures taken as of the interview (in spring of the interview year). Demographic controls include dummies for education,
number of children, number of adults, race, urban location and state unemployment rate. 1960 county variables include log of population, percent
of land in farming, percent of population black, urban, age<5, age>65 and with income less than $3,000 each interacted with a linear time trend.
Per capita county transfer income comes from the BEA REIS and includes measures for public assistance (AFDC, General Assistance), medical
care (Medicare, Medicaid, military), and retirement and disability benefits. Estimates are weighted using the PSID weight and clustered on
county. Standard errors are in parentheses and ***, **, and * indicate that the estimates are significant at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels.

Notes: Each row reports results from a separate regression of the log of total food spending on the FSP treatment, the log of real family income,
demographics, county variables, and fixed effects. The results in rows (1)-(6) are estimated on the sample of nonelderly singles and families
where the specification is identical to column (4) in Table 3. The treatment effect (coefficient on county FSP implementation) is scaled up to
reflect the impact per food stamp participant family. This is because in the estimating equation the treatment dummy is multiplied by the food
stamp participation rate, assigned by education-marital status-race-presence of children cells. The results in rows (7)-(8) correspond to the
specification in column (4) in Tables 4-5. The numbers in italics inflate the treatment effect by the sample food stamp participation rate in 1978.
See the notes to tables 3-5 for more details. Standard errors are in parentheses and ***, **, and * indicate that the estimates are significant at the
1%, 5% and 10% levels. Estimates are weighted using the PSID weight and clustered on county. All samples trim the data to drop observations
with unusual expenditure values (annual food expenditures less than $100, annual family income less than $500, or income share on food greater
than 0.85). The marginal propensities to consume food are evaluated at mean values for food expenditures and family income among food stamp
recipient families.

details. Standard errors are in parentheses and ***, **, and * indicate that the estimates are significant at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels. Estimates
are weighted using the PSID weight and clustered on county. Each panel corresponds to estimates from a different sample. The first panel
includes families where family income exceeds $50,000. The second panel takes the high income sample and restricts it further to include
married families with children. The third panel includes white married families with children where the head has 16 or more years of education.
All samples trim the data to drop observations with unusual expenditure values (annual food expenditures less than $100, annual family income
less than $500, or income share on food greater than 0.85).

Notes: Each parameter is from a separate regression of the outcome variable on a dummy variable equal to 1 if the county-year observation had a
food stamp program in place by January of the year prior to the interview year. The policy variable is multiplied by a group specific food stamp
participation rate for the results in the first panel, for all nonelderly singles and families. The sample comes from the PSID for interview years
1968-1978. The sample ends in 1978 due to the purchase requirement being eliminated is as of 1979. All other control variables and sample
selection correspond to specification (4) in Tables 3-5. All outcome variables correspond to annual measures for the year prior to the interview
(except the first column which is at the time of the survey) and all dollar amounts are expressed in real 2005 dollars. Estimates are weighted using
the PSID weight and clustered on county. Standard errors are in parentheses and ***, **, and * indicate that the estimates are significant at the
1%, 5% and 10% levels.

Notes: Each parameter is from a separate regression of the outcome variable on a dummy variable equal to 1 if the county-year observation had
a food stamp program in place in that year. Data is from 1960-1980 Census county level STF files. Counties in Alaska are dropped because of
missing data on food stamp program start date. 1960 county variables include log of population, percent of land in farming, percent of population
black, urban, age<5, age>65 and with income less than $3,000 each interacted with decade fixed effects. Per capita county transfer income comes
from the BEA REIS and includes measures for public assistance (AFDC, General Assistance), medical care (Medicare, Medicaid, military), and
retirement and disability benefits. Estimates are weighted using 1960 county population and are clustered on county. Standard errors are in
parentheses and ***, **, and * indicate that the estimates are significant at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels.

Note: PSID interview years 1969-1972 and 1974-1978. No food data is available in 1973 and 1968 is dropped due to inconsistencies in variable definitions. Observations
from Alaska are dropped because of missing data on food stamp program start date and observations with unusual expenditure values are dropped (annual food
expenditures less than $100, annual family income less than $500, or income share on food greater than 0.85). All outcome variables correspond to annual measures taken
as of the interview (in spring of the interview year).

Note: PSID interview years 1968-1978. Observations from Alaska are dropped because of missing data on food stamp program start date and observations with unusual
expenditure values are dropped (annual food expenditures less than $100, annual family income less than $500, or income share on food greater than 0.85). All outcome
variables (except head working last week) correspond to annual measures taken as of the interview (in spring of the interview year).
