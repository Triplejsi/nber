The Permanent Income Hypothesis and Consutnptiori Durability:
Analysis based on Japanese Panel Data

ABSTRACT

The permanent income hypothesis is tested on a four—quarter panel of about two

thousand Japanese households for ten commodity groups. Consumption is a
distributed lag function of expenditures, and the utility function is

additively separable in time. Durability is defined as the persistence of the
distributed lag. The permanent income hypothesis implies that, for each
commodity group, expected change in expenditures is correlated neither with

past expenditure changes on other commodities nor with expected change in

disposable income, if its own lags are controlled for. The main results are
the following: (1) durability is substantial even for food and services, (2)
the permanent income hypothesis applies to almost all (probably more than
ninety percent) of the population, and (3) the habit persistence hypothesis is
rejected in favor of the permanent income hypothesis.

1. INTRODUCTION and SUMMARY
The empirical validity of the permanent income hypothesis' is a long-

standing issue that has been debated for nearly three decades. At the heart
of the debate is the question of whether or not consumption is "too sensitive"

to income fluctuations. Its operational meaning was not given until the
publication of Hall's (1978) paper which has shown that the permanent income

hypothesis implies the marginal utility of consumption is a martingale. Since
then quite a few papers have studied the issue of the excess sensitivity of

or triem nave aiso tried to estimate tne traction or

households in the population that follow the permanent income hypothesis

rather than simply keep track of disposable income. Although those papers
differ in terms of the component of consumption (food, nondurables, services,
or durables) and the kind of data set (time—series, cross—section, or panel)
that they use, there seems to be a consensus that the permanent income hypothesis applies to 70 to 100 percent of the population.

As impressive as it is, the empirical literature has failed to address

two important issues. First, not much attention has been paid to the distinction between consumption and expenditures. Total expenditures are dichoto-

mized into perishables (nondurables and services) and durables. Since the
permanent income hypothesis is a theory about the flow of consumption, the
empirical literature has either looked at perishables alone or singled out

durables for special treatment. However, it is not entirely clear that most
commodities labeled as nondurables and services are perishable so that

consumption and expenditures can be equated. A good example is dental
services.3 People go to a dentist not because they enjoy the treatment but
because they hope that their teeth will be in good shape for some time to

come. So dental services are essentially durable expenditures. Another

—2—
example is a pleasure trip. It is obviously physically perishable, but it
might have a lasting psychological effect on preferences as people derive

utility from the memory of a trip. If so, recreational expenditures should be
treated as if they are durable expenditures. Second, all the empirical
evidence that has been put forth to support the permanent income hypothesis —

with

a possible exception of Hall and Mishkin (1982) — seems to be also

consistent with the habit persistence hypothesis (Brown [19521) that current
consumption is determined by the history of past consumption and current

income hypothesis, the distinction between permanent and temporary tax changes
is a crucial one. That is not the case if households are backward—looking as
is postulated by the habit peristence hypothesis. So it is important from the
viewpoint of stabilization policies to discriminate the permanent income
hypothesis from the habit persistence hypothesis.

This study attempts to address the above two issues as wellas obtain a
sharper estimate of the fraction of the population that is explained by the

permanent income hypothesis. It uses a four—quarter panel of about two
thousand households in Japan for ten commodity groups. The unique feature of
this data set is that it has information on expectations about expenditures

and income. The most striking fact revealed by the data set is that an
increase in expenditures tends to be followed by a decrease, i.e., the first—

order autocorrelation in expenditure changes are negative. This seems to be
inconsistent with the permanent income hypothesis, if consumption is well
proxied by expenditures.

The theoretical model in this study makes an explicit distinction between
consumption and expenditures by postulating that consumption is a distributed

lag function of current and past expenditures. Otherwise the model is a

—3--

standard one: the household's objective function is additively separable in
time, and the lifetime budget constraint is the only constraint faced by the

household. It is shown, under a certain set of restrictions on the household's preferences, that consumption follows a martingale. This means that
change in expenditures on any single commodity group depends only on its own
past changes and unforecastable events, namely it is an univariate auto—

regression. If the commodity is perishable both physically and psychologi—
cally (so that expenditures affect the utility only for the current period),
there should be no lagged expenditure changes in the univariate autoregression; if the commodity is highly durable, lagged expenditure changes should

have coefficients close to unity in absolute value. Thus the theoretical
model provides a unified treatment of commodities with differing degrees of

durability. This is useful from the viewpoint of macroeconomic stabilization
policies, because the implied equation is stated in expenditures, not in
consumption, and expenditures are components of aggregate demand.
There are three major empirical findings that emerge from the estimation

of the model. First, lagged expenditure changes are significant even for food
and services, which suggests that they are not really perishables. Second, if
its own lags are controlled for, current change in expenditures is not

sensitive to the forecastable part of current income change. That is to say,
the rnartingale hypothesis is valid in consumption, but not in expenditures.

Third, current change in expenditures is sensitive to the unforecastable part
of current income change.

It is hard to reconcile this finding with the habit

persistence hypothesis which assumes households are backward—looking.

The plan of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the data set
and takes a look at sample means, standard deviations, and correlations of

relevant variables. Section 3 presents the theoretical model and derives the

—4--

equation stated in expenditures. A few econometric issues concerning the
estimation of the equation on a short panel are discassed in Section 4.

Parameter estimates are presented in Section 5. The paper concludes with a
few remarks in Section 6.

2. DATA DESCRIPTION
The data set for the present study is obtained from the 1982 Survey of

Family Consumption compiled by the Economic Planning Agency of the Japanese

government. This is an interview panel survey in which families reported to
visiting interviewers every three months over a four—quarter period (1981:Q2—

1982:Q1). More specifically, respondents are asked at the end of each quarter
to provide the following information: (1) expenditures on ten different and
mutually exclusive commodity groups for the quarter,4 (Ii) "normal" income net
of taxes and social security contributions, (iii) "temporary" income net of
taxes and social security contributions, (iv) the respondentts expectations
(at the end of each quarter) of all the variables in the above three items for
the following quarter, and (v) family characteristics (occupation, family

size, age of the head, and housing tenure).5 "Normal" income is equal to
after—tax labor income net of bonuses. "Temporary" income is the sum of
property income, bonuses, severence pay, and tax returns at the end of a

calender year. The survey does not cover one—person households. Although
this is not a diary survey, interviewers actually visited the households every
quarter and the respondents filled out the questionaire La the presence of the

interviewer. There are practically no attritions: for any quarter at least
99.5 percent of the surveyed 5,837 households responded. Information about
food, for example, is elicited by the question: "How much did your family

—5—
spend on food for the last three months?' and "How much do you expect your
family will spend on food for the next three months?"

Of the original sample, only "workers' households," namely households

whose head is on a payroll, are selected. They are about 58 percent of the
original sample. Farmers and households with unincorporated business are
excluded from the sample as their income pattern is distinctly different from

that of workers' households who receive semiannual bonuses. If the age of the
head either increases by more than a year or decreases, the household is

deleted in forming the panel. It became necessary to delete the sample from
the entire Tokyo prefecture and other parts of the country, because I could

not form a four—quarter panel due to some coding problem. At this stage the
sample size became 2,518. From this, households which did not provide
relevant information (455 cases) and then households which changed their
housing tenure (from a homeowner to a nonhomeowner or from a nonhomeowner to a

homeowner) (46 cases) are deleted.6 This left a sample oF 2,017 cases. For
this sample I examined the empirical distribution and decided to remove seven

cases which reported extreme values.7 The sample size become 2,010.
The variables used in the analysis are as follows (for a quick reference
see Table 8):

Cl = expenditures
on food (including liquor and beverages and excluding
meals away from home);

C2 = expenditures
on

rents, fuel and utilities;

C3 = expenditures
on

clothing and household textiles;

C4 = expenditures
on

consumer durables (including furniture, electric

appliances, mtsical instruments, cameras, automobiles, bikes,
bicycles, sports equipments, and stainless sinks);
C5

recrettonal expenses (including vacation expenses, movies,

—6—
admission fees, and meals away from home);

C6 =

"cultural"

expenses (including reading materials, tuition for

cultural activities such as flower arrangement, cooking, tea
ceremoy, music and dance);

C7 = educational

expenses (including tuition, books, supplies and

equipments for kindergardens, elementary and high schools, colleges
and universities);

C8 = medical

expenses not paid by the national health insurance, glasses

and medical appliances for personal use;

C9 = "social'
ClO =

other

expenses (including gifts and contributions);

expenditures (including housewares, repairs, personal care

services, transportation and communication, telephone charges,

private insurance premiums, shoes, unbrellas, and vehicle
operations);

IT = "temporary"

income consisting of bonuses, income from interests,

dividends and estates, insurance payments, severance pay, and tax
returns;

YN = "normal"

income consisting of regular wages and salaries; the sum of

YN and YT is equal to income net of taxes, social security
contributions, and national health insurance taxes;
YD

YN + YT, disposable income;

AGE = age of the household head;
FSZ

family size (i.e., the number of persons in the family).

I use subscripts to denote the quarter. For example, Cl1 is food expenditures
in the first quarter of the panel (1981:Q2), and Cl4 is food expenditures in

quarter four (1982:Ql). Consumption and income variables are all deflated by
the corresponding components of the CPI (consumer price index). Variables C9,

—7—
YN and YT are deflated by the overall CPI. A weighted average of the transportation, communication, and miscellaneous components of the CPI is used to

deflate ClO. Since prices were very stable during the period covered by the
panel (the inflation rate during the period was 2.8 percent), the choice of

the deflator is immaterial. Panel A of Table 1 displays the means and
standard deviations of the relevant variables.

In the subsequent analysis, I will use consumption expenditures and

income adjusted for family size. This adjustment is done by dividing the
variable by the number of equivalent adults which is estimated by regressing

the log of the variable on family size dummies. The regressions are run on
pooled data. Table 2 reports the results of expenditures and income regressions on pooled data. If the regressions were run for each quarter, the
intercept term would pick up economy—wide shocks and the residual would be

purged of any seasonal and macroeconomic fluctuations. The antilog of the
residual from the pooled regression is taken to be the value of the variable

adjusted for family size. If the (unadjusted) value is zero, its adjusted
value is set at zero also. Put more formally, the family size—adjusted value
of

is the ratio of the unadjusted value fo X divided by fx(FSZt), where

is a function defined in Table 2 that converts family size in period t, FSZt,
into the number of equivalent adults specific to X (X =

example, ci2 = 1.0,

C1,C2,,,.,C10).8

For

ci3 = exp(.232), ci4 = exp(.326), ci5

exp(.423), and so forth. These numbers come from the estimated coefficients
of the family size dummies reported in Table 2. The number of equivalent
adults is normalized to unity for two—person families. (Note that the sample
does not include one—person households.)

The means and standard deviations

of the family sLze—adjusted variables thus obtained are displayed in Panel B
of Table 1.

Since the R2 for the regressions reported in Table 2 is uniformly

—8—
very low except for food expenditures and since very few households changed
its family size during the period of the survey, this particular way of
adjusting for family size should not (and in fact did not) influence the
results to be reported in this paper in any important way.

The present data set contains information on expectations held by

households. Since the period of the survey is from 1981:Q2 to 1982:Q1,
reported expectations refer to the period of 1981:Q3 to 1982:Q2.

I will put

subscript "e" to denote expected values; for example, C1 denotes the house—
holds expectation, formed at the end of period t—i, of Ci in period t
(t =

2,3,4,5,

or t = 1981:Q3 to l982:Q2.). Exactly the same procedure for

family size adjustment is used for expected values of expenditures. It is
assumed that households can correctly foresee their family size one quarter
ahead, so that actual family size is used to make family size adjustment on

expected values. To be more precise, the family size—adjusted value of

the unadjusted value of X divided by fx(FSZt), where

is

is the function that

translates family size in period t, FSZt, into the number of equivalent adults
specific to X (X =

Cl,C2,...,ClO;

t =

2,3,4,5).

Since there is no information

on FSZ5 in the present four—quarter panel, it is assumed that FSZ5 is equal to

FSZ4. I also assume that each relevant component of the CPI is correctly
foreseen by households one quarter ahead, so that actual values of the
relevant deflators are used to convert expected values of expenditures and two
components of income into real terms.

The theory to be presented in the next section is stated in terms of

changes in expenditures. Theoretical considerations apart, it is a good idea
to work with changes since levels of expenditures are likely to have household

specific components that are time invariant. Table 3 displays the means and
standard deviations of changes in the ten (family size—adjusted) commodity

—9—
groups and in the two (family size—unadjusted) components of income. As
expected, the most volatile commodity group is durables. Both the level and
the change of durables goods expenditures have a high standard deviation.

This is a consequence of the lumpiness of durable purchases. In fact, in any
given quarter, over forty percent of the sample reported zero expenditures on
durables.

A quite surprising fact is revealed if one examines the autocorrelation

structure of changes which is reported in Table 4. The first—order auto—
correlation is uniformly negative and large in absolute value, even for

changes in food expenditures. It is not surprising that changes in durable
expenditures are negatively autocorrelated because of the lumpiness of durable

purchases. However, the fact that an increase in food expenditures tends to
be followed by a decrease is unsettling, because one would expect households

to smooth out consumption over time. In fact, Hall's (1978) permanent income
hypothesis implies that changes in consumption are serially uncorrelated as
the level of consumption is changed only when the consumer receives new

information. That implication is strongly rejected by the present data.
Several explanation are conceivable for the strong negative autocorre—

lation. First, as Table 1 shows, expenditures have seasonality. In
particular, expenditures go up in the fourth quarter and come back down in the

first quarter of the following year. If the effect of seasonality is muitiplicative rather than additive, then the autocorrelation coefficients in
changes will be negative.

1 performed seasonal adjustment on expenditures and

income to re—calculate the sample autocorrelations.9 This is reported in the
right half of table 4. Although the size of autocorrelation involving the
fourth quarter is now smaller in general, the strong negative autocorrelation
still remains.

— 10 —

The second explanation is measurement error. Survey data on expenditures

are necessarily subject to measurement error. If the levels of expenditures
are measured with error, changes in measured expenditures will have a moving

average term which induces negative autocorrelation. The third explanation is
that preferences are subject to taste shocks. This also introduces a moving
average term in expenditure changes.10 Both measurement error and taste
shocks may explain some of the negative correlation in expenditure changes.

However, I do not think they are the main factor. For one thing, in a
separate study that uses monthly diary survey data, it Is found that monthly

change in food expenditures are strongly negatively correlated.11 Since it is
reasonable to assume measurement error in diary surveys is small, something
other than measurement error must be responsible for the negative auto—

correlation. Another reason that measurement error and taste shocks are
unimportant is provided by the vector autoregression (VAR) model estimated in

Table 5•12 Suppose that change in expenditures is the sum of new information
(forecast errors) and a moving average of measurement error and taste shocks.
It is plausible that measurement error and taste shocks are uncorrelated with

income changes. It is also plausible that income changes are correlated with
forecast errors. Then if current expenditure change is regressed on lagged
expenditure changes and lagged income changes, both lagged expenditure changes

and lagged income changes should be significant. The results in Panel A of
Table 5, on the contrary, say that only lagged expenditure changes are

significant at the 1% significance level except for C9 (social expenses). The
significant contemporaneous correlation between expenditure changes and income
changes reported in Panel B of Table 5 implies that expenditure changes are
not dominanted by measurement error and taste shocks.

It is the basic theme of this paper that the main factor that lies behind

— 11 —

the

significant negative autocorrelation in expenditure changes is the

durability of commodities. The next section sets up an optimization model
that is capable of explaining the negative autocrrelation.

3. THEORY
As is made

clear

in the previous section, the standard permanent income

hypothesis (Hall [1978]) is inconsistent with the data. Here I present a
modified version of the standard theory. The key feature will be the durability of commodities. Consider a household whose intertemporal decision

That is, current consumption is a distributed lag function of current and past

expenditures. This is a generalization of the usual formula for durable goods

The right hand side of this equation is the marginal cost

of foregoing one unit of expenditures on the j—th commodity. This involves a
summation from 0 to N because a change in current expenditures influences

current and future consumption for M periods. The left hand side is the

marginal benefit of increasing l+r t+1 units of expenditures on commodity j
in the next period. This also involves a summation from 0 to N for the same

reason. In Appendix A it is shown that: Under (3.4),

Equation (3.5) can be made tractable under two alternative assumptions.

and that

It then is easy to show that (3.5) reduces to (3.9) with dit = 0.

This is a

multi—commodity version of of Hall's (1978) martingale hypothesis. Under
either assumption about the instantaneous utility function, consumption on

commodity j is unrelated to lagged consumption on other commodities. Note
that this result is obtained under the assumption which does not assume intra—
temporal separability among commodities.'4

The foregoing discussion has ignored two issues, namely family size and

seasonality. I will incorporate them into the model in the following fashion.

Let jt be the commodity—specific number of equivalent adults in period t.
will use lower case letters c and c. to represent expenditure and consumption on commodity j in period t expressed in equivalent adult per capita,
i.e.,

It is reasonable to suppose that current consumption per equivalent capita is

(j=1,2,...,n) serves to represent both seasonal variations in the

where Ft is an overall index of family size and at is an n—dimensional vector

of seasonality factors. The resulting equation is again (3.9') where
redefined as

commodity—specific number of equivalent adults and of the seasonality factors
in periods t and t+1. In short, the family size effect is incorporated in

(3.9') in the family size—adjusted consumption c and in the intercept term
djt

and seasonality is incorporated in the intercept term.

and the (absolute) degree of risk

(3.14) has a strong implication that nothing should

c

if expectations are rational [so that Et(e t+1

0]. So, for example, a fully anticipated tax cut should have no effect
whatsoever when it is enacted; only unexpected policies can influence the

behavior of expenditures. This can be easily tested on time—series data
(provided that the real rate is constant), but to do the same thing on short
panel data is difficult for two reasons.

— 17 —

First,

at any given point in time the forecast error e+i can be

correlated with any variable dated t if the correlation is taken with respect

to the distribution across households.'5 Since the present panel has a small
time dimension and a large cross—section dimension, estimation of equations

like (3.14) will have to exploit the cross—section dimension. But the
rational expectations hypothesis does not necessarily preclude correlation in
cross—section between the right hand side variables and the forecast error

term e1,+1. It is precisely for this reason that equation (3.14') rather
than equation (3.14) forms a basis for the equation to be estimated in section

5. The second difficulty is that the length of the panel data is too short to
allow for a realistic lag length in (3.14). But this can be overcome by the
use of instrumental variables, as we will see in the next section.

My prior expectation is that the theory just presented will fail empirically. Probably the most likely source of failure is liquidity constraints or
borrowing constraints. Casual observations and my own experience show that
expenditures by economics graduate students (in the U.S.) are largely deter-

mined by their current income and their ability to borrow. A most natural way
to incorporate borrowing constraints is to let the interest rate be endogenous

and depend on the household's income and asset position. But then the Euler
equation (3.4) will become much more complicated, because the marginal benefit
of foregoing one unit of expenditures consists not only of increased expendi-

tures in the next period but also of improved credit conditions. Furthermore,
the present data set has no information on assets and liabilities, so it is
impossible to implement the idea of endogenous interest rates in a satisfactory fashion.

The view about borrowing constraints taken in this study is that part of
the households in the population behaves according to the permanent income

— 18 —

hypothesis described above while the remaining part does not. Households
which do not follow the permanent income hypothesis are subject to borrowing
constraints, in the sense that the marginal propensity to spend out of current

disposable income is unity. If a constant fraction a1 of additional dispos—
able income of constrained households goes to expenditures on commodity j, the
behavior of expenditures by constrained households is described by

issues concerning the estimation of (3.14') and (3.15').

4.

ECONOMETRIC ISSUES

The main objective in the remaining part of this
paper is to estimate the
parameters of the two equations (3.14') and (3.15') that describe the behavior
of unconstrained and constrained households.

This section discusses three

issues that should be taken into account when one deals with cross—section or

panel data. They are: (i) individual (or household—specific)

effects, (ii)

measurement error, and (iii) heteroskedasticity. Most of the discussion in
this section will be technical and rather

lengthy. Nontechnical readers can

skip to the last paragraph of this section without

losing continuity.

I think it is reasonable to assume that the lag coeFficients

(3.14') are the same across households. Those

are just a description of the

mechanical relationship between expenditures and consumption; the shape of the
lag distribution will be largely determined by the nature of the commodity,
not by (observable and unobservable) characteristics

of the household, It is,

however, probably unrealistic to assume that the rate of time preference

and

the degree of risk aversion i. (j=1,2,...,) are constant across households.
They will most likely depend on the age of the household head and some other

unobservable household characteristics. This means that the intercept term
in (3.14') depends not only on observable household characteristics such
as age and change in family size but also on unobservable characteristics

(individual effects).16 One can always write

(4.1)

dit =

linear

function of AGE and AGE2 +

as:

(j=1,2,..,n)

— 20

where

AGE is the age of

the

—

household head and where the linear function of

AGE and AGE2 is the least squares projection of

on AGE, AGE2. So

represents unobservable household characteristics that are uncorrelated with

AGE and AGE2. The theoretical discussion in section 3 implies that

also

depends on change in family size and seasonality. Since estimation will be
performed in the cross—section dimension for a fixed t (t4), there is no need
to explicitly incorporate seasonality in (4.1). Family size in period 5 is
not in the data set; I assume there is no change in family size from period 4

to period 5. This is why change in family size does not appear in (4.1). The
unobservable individual effect (i.e., unobservable household characteristics)
will be a part of the error term in the estimation equation.

Another source of the error term is the truncation remainder. As the
panel is only four quarters long, only three lags, namely

—1(c4 — c3)

2(c3 — c2)

c1) can be included in the

be included in the error term. It is easy to see from (3.14) and (4.1) that
the remaining lags can be written as the sum of three parts: (1) the part
that can be linearly predicted by AGE and AGE2; (ii) the individual effect
that are uncorrelated with AGE and AGE2; and (iii) a weighted sum of past

forecast errors e,5_k (k

4),

The deviation of the sum of (ii) and (iii)

from its population mean will be called the truncation remainder and denoted

by TR. It is reasonable to assume that AGE and AGE2 are uncorrelated with
(iii) above because the household can predict its future AGE perfectly. Thus
the truncation remainder TR for commodity j is the part of the remaining lags
that are uncorrelated with AGE and AGE2. This is the second component of the
error term.

If, in addition, there is measurement error in expenditures, the error

— 21 —

term will have measurement error as the third component.'7 Thus the estimation equation becomes

There is no shortage of reasons why the error terms v and w in two
equations (4.2) and (4.4) are correlated with the right hand side variables.
Since the error term contains measurement error, there is the classical

errors—in—variables problem. The truncation remainder, TR, is obviously
correlated with the first three lags,

Since individual differences in the

is also correlated with the first three lags. But suppose there are
available a set of instruments, x, for which

and E(.i.x.) = 0

(j1,2,...,n).

— 22 —

This assumption means that neither the individual effect, nor the truncation
remainder, nor measurement error is correlated with x. The two variables AGE
and AGE2 are valid instruments as it can be reasonably assumed that they are
uncorrelated with measurement errors.

Let X be the fraction of constrained households in the population (from

which the sample was drawn), Then (4.2) holds with probability 1 —

where EDY4 family size—adjusted expected change in disposable income, is
defined in (3.16), and the error term fl is composed of the three components,
namely the individual effect, the truncation remainder, and measurement

errors. To derive (4.6) it is necessary to assume that the fraction X is
constant, independent of the right hand side variables and instruments. If
this assumption sounds too strong, one can think of (4.6) as a device to test
the permanent incoe hypothesis; testing for X

0 amounts to a test of the

hypothesis. Equation (4.6) can be estimated by two— or three—stage least

squares with x as instruments. This is the equation to be estimated in the
next section.

The final econometric issue is heteroskedasticity. Since the present
data set is a random sample, the variables in (4.6) are i.i.d. (independently

— 23 —

and identically distributed) across households. So the unconditional variance
of ii.

is constant. However, the conditional variance of n. conditional on x.

inference the standard theory of two— and three—stage least squares is

inadequate. Fortunately, however, the theory has recently been generalized to
encompass heteroskedasticity (see, e.g. Chamberlain [1982]). I now briefly
summarize it.

for the VAR model. Formulas (4.10)—(4.13) are the ones I will use in calculating the point estimates and their associated standard errors for equation
(4.6) in the next section.

To summarize: The equation to be estimated is (4.6) which explicitly
recognizes that a certain fraction X of the population is liquidity const-

rained. This equation will be estimated in the cross—section dimension.
Since the panel is only four quarters long, only three lagged expenditure
changes can be included on the right hand side, and the remaining lags (the

truncation remainder) are relegated to the error term. Also included in the
error term are the individual effect (i.e., individual differences in the rate
of time preference and the degree of risk aversion) and measurement error.
This provides a reason for correlation between the error term and the right

hand side variables. The equation will be estimated by instrumental variables
in a way that is robust to heteroskedasticity.

RESULTS

To anticipate the results, identification of A (the fraction of liquidity

constrained households in the population) turned out to be rather tenuous. So
I first present the parameter estimates of the pure permanent income hypothesis represented by equation (4.6) with A = 0, and then turn to the estimation of A.

The critical issue in estimating equation (4.6) with A

0 by the

generalized two—stage least squares is the choice of instruments. Valid

— 26 —

instruments must be uncorrelated with the three components of the error
term n, namely the individual effect, the truncation remainder, and measure-

ment error. I include AGE and ACE2 in the set of instruments. As for the
instruments for lagged expenditure changes
associated unexpected changes

cti

(t2,3,4), I use the

(t=2,3,4). It is reasonable to assume

that unexpected changes are uncorrelated with the individual effect which is

known to the household. As is shown in Table 6, there is some evidence of
statistically significant correlation between unexpected expenditure changes
and lagged actual expenditure changes, implying that unexpected changes carl be

correlatedwith the truncation remainder. But what Table 6 also tells us is
that the correlation is small in size —— much smaller than the correlation of

actual change with its own lagged changes. So the bias due to correlation of
instruments with the truncation remainder will be small, if any. There is no
a priori reason to preclude correlation between unexpected change and measure-

ment error. I use unexpected changes as instruments because I think there is
no other valid choice of instruments. But at least there is one case in which
measurement error causes no problem. It is the case where actual expenditures

and its expectation c are subject to the same measurement error. In
this case measured unexpected change

—

ct

is free from measurement error.

If unexpected change contained a large measurement error, it would be serially

correlated. But Table 6 shows no particularly strong autocorrelation in

unexpected changes. Thus, the set of instruments for estimating equation

(4.6) with A = 0 for commodity group j

is:

(1AGE,AGE2, c4 —

The number of instruments is equa1 to the number of the right

A of Table 7 for the ten commodity groups. The intercept, the AGE and AGE2

coefficients are not reported because none of them are significant at 5

percent. All but one lag coefficients are highly significant. The estimated
first three lag coefficients p1, p2, p3 are small (but significant) for

food (Cl) and very close to unity for durables (C4) and clothes (C3). This is
very reasonable. What is (probably not really surprising but) revealing is
the large lag coefficients for commodity groups (C5—C9) that are usually

labeled as "services." Even though services are physically perishable, their
psychological effect on households' preference is long—lasting. The lag
coefficents for C5 seems unduly large because, if taken seriously, they mean
that people derive more utility from the memory of a trip than from the trip

itself. This is probably due to sampling error, as the standard errors for C5

is

very high.

For later reference I report the parameter estimates by the ordinary

least square in Panel B of Table 7. The estimated lag coefficients are
smaller than the estimates by the two—stage least squares, because of measurement errors and because the first three lagged changes are negatively correlated with the truncation remainder (as is predicted by the permanent income
hypothesis).

The estimated model allows for no feedback from lagged expenditure

changes on other commodity groups. It might he that the surprisingly high
durability of services is due to the influence of lagged expenditures on, say,

consumer durables. To check this, I expanded equation (4.6) with

X

0 to

include lagged expenditure changes on other commodity groups. So the equation

now has c5 —

commodity groups (j =

1,2,..,,1O)

with AGE, AGE2, and the associated unex-

1,2,...,1O) as instruments. Table 8 reports

pertinent Wald—type statistics for the hypothesis that lagged expenditure

changes on other commodity groups have all zero coefficients. Except for C4
(consumer durables) and possibly C2 (rent, fuel and utilities), lagged

expenditure changes on other commodities are totally insignificant. One
possible reason for the rejection of the hypothesis for durables is that the

equation for durables is misspecified. The equation was derived from the
Euler equation (3.4) under the assumption of interior solution. But in any
given quarter over forty percent of the households in the sample reported no

expenditures on consumer durables. Since those households are at the corner
solution, the Euler equation does not hold for durables. Some other estimation technique such as Tobit and Probit would be required in order to
correctly treat the durables equation. The possible niisspecification of the
durables equation was, in fact, the main reason for not using the generalized
three—stage least squares; by sticking to the (generalized) two—stage least
squares I can avoid biases due to the transmission of misspecificatiori in one
equation to another.

I now turn to the estimation of equation (4.6) without the X
restriction.

I tried two alternative instruments for instrumenting

0

EDY4,

family size—adjusted expected disposable income change. One is family size—
adjusted expected normal income change, which is obtained by substituting YN
in place of YD in the definition (3.16) of EDY4. As is seen from Table 5,
there is no significant feedback from lagged expenditures to normal income.
So it is reasonable to assume that this instrument is uncorrelated with the

truncation remainder. It is also plausible that the individual effect is

uncorrelated with this instrument. If normal income is measured without

— 29 —

error,

there is no correlation between this instrument and measurement error

in EDY4. The generalized two—stage least squares estimate of X turned out to
be .374 with a standard error of .131. However, estimates of the lag

coefficients jk (k =

1,2,3)

became unduly high; for example, estimate of

p.1 for j = 5 (recreatinal expenses) is 1.93 with a standard error of .69.

This is because the coefficients of lagged expenditures changes, which are
have changed very little compared with the case with X = 0.

The

second alternative instrument is (lagged) unexpected disposable income change,

YD.

YD4 —

This produced an estimate of —.12!

The reason for such unreliable estimates is that expected disposable

income change is hard to explain. A regression of EDY4 on (family size—
adjusted) expected normal income change yields an R2 of only about .08. (The
second instrument has even less explanatory power). Change in disposable
income is dominated by temporary income.

After going through all this, I decided to treat EDY4 as predeter—

mined. That is, the instrument for EDY4 is EDY4 itself. The parameter
estimates for equation (4.6) with EDY4 predetermined are given in Table 9.

The estimates are rather implausible for a couple of reasons. For one thing,

the estimate of c's says that liquidity constrained households spends about
fouty—four percent of their additional income on durables. This is a bit
unrealistic. Probably this high estimate reflects the lumpiness of durables,

an element that is not incorproated in the permanent income hypothesis. If
durables are lumpy and if there are transaction costs in trading durables, it
seems plausible that optimizing households try to synchronize the timing of

durable purchases with income fluctuations. Another implausible fact about
Table 9 is that the estimates of the lag coefficients are too high, parti-

cularly for durables (C4) and recreational expenses (C5). Again, estimates of

— 30 —

— (l_X)P.k

(k

coefficients

1,2,3) have changed very little; the estimates of the lag
in Table 9 are uniformly higher than those in Table 9A by

about fifteen percent. If reasonable estimates of the lag coefficients for
durables are around unity, the estimate of A of .12 seems to be biased
upwards.

To examine the source of the bias, I calculated the sample correlation

between EDY4 and lagged expenditure changes. This is reported in Table 10.
Although correlation is not very strong, there is a tendency that correlation
becomes significantly negative as expenditure changes go back into the past.

This suggests that EDY4 is negatively correlated with the truncation remainder and hence is

correlated with the error term

which depends

negatively on the truncation remainder. This provides an upward bias on the
estimate of A.

On the other hand, measurement error in EDY4 implies a

downward bias. Although the direction of the bias can go either way in
general, an upward bias seems more likely because measurement error in
disposable income is likely to be small for the present sample of workers'
households.

On the whole, then, the empirical evidence has brought up quite clearly
the surprisingly high durability of consumption expenditures while the

evidence for liquidity constraints is weak. But is this consistent with time—
series data? This is an important question to ask because on the U.S.
aggregate time—series data change in expenditures on nondurables and services

as a whole is very much like white noise (Hall [1978]). The Japanese National
Income Accounts have two different classifications of personal consumption

expenditures. The first has four commodity groups by durability (nondurables,

semidurables, durables, and services). Durable expenditures in this classi—
ficaiton seem to correspond to C4 (clurables) in the present survey data. The

— 31 —

second classification of expenditures is more in line with the one in the
present survey data and has eight commodity groups: (1) food, beverages and
tobacco, (Li) rents (including imputed rents), fuel, and utilities, (iii)
clothes and footwears, (iv) furniture, household appliances, and housewares,
(v) recreation and education, (vi) medical care, (vii) transportation and

communication, and (viii) other. Roughly speaking, items (i), (ii) and (iii)
correspond to Cl, C2 and C3, respectively, and item (v) corresponds to the sum

of C5, C6 and C7 in the present survey data. For those commodity groups,
third—order univariate autoregressions in changes are estimated by the
ordinary

least squares on the Japanese National Income Accounts data. The

results are reported in Table 11. Except for durables, the estimated lag
coefficients point to a substantial degree of durability. The time—series
estimates in Table 11 are to be compared with the ordinary least squares
estimates of equation (4.6) with X = 0 in Panel B of Table 7 which also

truncates the lag distribution at the third lag.19 The two sets of point
estimates are fairly close to each other with the exception of the durable

goods equation. The standard errors, however, are much larger for time—series
estimates, reflecting a relatively small amount of information contained in

aggregate time—series data. It thus seems fair to conclude that the panel
evidence in this paper is consistent with the time—series evidence and that
time—series data do not have enough power to detect consumption durability.

The evidence presented so far is favorable to the permanent income

hypothesis with consumption durability. However, the evidence is aLso

consistent with the habit sistence

which posits that current

expenditures are determined by lagged expenditures and current disposable

income.20 If this hypothesis is right, expenditure change on commodity j from
period 3 (1981:Q4) to period 4 (l982:Ql) may be written as21

are given in Table 12. The results are again favorable to

the permanent income hypothesis. First, the estimated coefficients of lagged
expenditure changes are roughly in line with those in Table 7 and Table 9•22
The habit persistence hypothesis has no theory of why the lag coefficients
take the kind of pattern in terms of signs and magnitudes reported in the

Table. Second, the estimate of the coefficient of unexpected disposable
income change of .29 is much higher than the estimate of actual disposable

income change coefficient of .08.23 Households respond to unexpected rather
than actual income changes. This strongly suggests that households are
forward—looking as is assumed in the permanent income hypothesis. The
evidence in Table 12, however, does reject the permanent income hypothesis,

because if the hypothesis is literally correct actual income change ADY3
should have no role in equation (5.3). One interpretation of the coefficient
of actual

income change of about eight percent is that it

is the fraction of

households in the population. This number is fairly

close to the estimate of

of about twelve percent.

Throughout this section I have ignored taste shocks which, if present,

should form the fourth component of the error term. The instruments I have

used for lagged expenditure changes — unexpected expenditure changes —

are

positively correlated with unforecastable taste shocks. If so, the lag

coefficents jk estimated in this section are biased upwards while the
income coefficients remain unbiased. This may explain the significantly
positive lag coefficients for food expenditures, if food is a priori believed

to be perfectly perishable. However, as I argued toward the end of section 2,
there seems to be no strong reason to believe that taste shocks are important

— 34 —

in

explaining the behavior of expenditure changes.

6. CONCLUDING REMARKS
The initial aim of the research reported here was to obtain a sharp
estimate of the fraction of liquidity constrained households in the population

by exploiting the large cross—section dimension of the data. This paper was
not very successful on this account. The paper, however, was successful in
highlighting the long—lasting effect of consumption

expendtures

for services

and nondurables. Another useful by—product is the paper's demonstration of
the strong response of expenditures to unexpected income changes without an
explicit modelling of the income process, which leaves little doubt about the
forward—looking nature of consumers.

The surprisingly high durablity of commodities has important implications
for the econometrics of consumer demand and for macroeconomic stabilization

policies. The usual specification in the econometrics of consumer demand is
that the demand for nondurables and for services is a function of their

current prices and total current expenditures. This is

appropriate

if the

effect on preferences of nondurables and services is instantaneous. Otherwise
the relevant variable is the user costs of capital, not current prices.24
Expenditures and consumption should be treated like investment and capital,
respectively.

Since the existing literature has ignored the durability of nondurables
and services, its consensus estimate of the fraction of constrained households
is likely to be biased upwards; what appears to be the excess sensitivity of
expenditures to income may be merely due to the exclusion of lagged expendi-

tures. Thus the effectiveness of countercyclical tax policy to control

— 35

aggregate demand by changing disposable income may

not

be a great as is

generally supposed. A potentially more important factor suggested by the
durability of commodities is the real interest rate as a determinant of (the

optimal stock of) consumption. If the real interest rate is controllable and
if consumption is sensitive to the real rate, then policymakers can manipulate
expenditures by the households that follow the permanent income hypothesis.
The present paper was silent on the issue of the interest elasticity of
consumption because of the small time—series dimension of the data.

Although the paper was able to reject the permanent income hypothesis,
about a half of the excess sensitivity comes from durable purchases, as the

results in Tables 9 and 12 show. It seems plausible that the apparent
sensitivity of lumpy durable purchases can be generated by a model that allows
for a small wedge between the borrowing and lending rates without signifi-

cantly altering the behavior of nondurables and services expenditures. If so,
the permanent income hypothesis with this minor modification applies to

virtually all households. Furthermore, whether policymakers can exploit the
short—run sensitivity of durables purchases in order to control aggregate
consumer expenditures over a medium—run such as the length of a business cycle
is another question.

More fundamentally, the empirical validity of the permanent income
hypothesis casts serious doubts about the wisdom of couritercyclical policies.

The fact that expenditure changes follow univariate autoregressions with order

higher than one implies that cyclical fluctuations in expenditures are a
result of optimization on the part of forward—looking consumers. What, then,
is the point in disturbing the optimally chosen time path of expenditures?

Appendix B: Time Aggregation
There is no reason that the length of a unit period for the household's

optimization problem is exactly one quarter. The purpose of this appendix is
to show that the quarterly model ——

(3.14) in the text —— can be

equation

derived as an approximation to the continuous—time model.
The continuous—time versions of (3.9) is

(B.1)

(r') —

(i) = e(T,T'),

E1e(r,T') = 0 for r' > T,

where the subscript j is dropped for notational simplicity and the intercept
term dt is ignored for simplicity. Let t =

0,1,2,...

be points in the

continuous—time axis that mark the end of each quarter. Set T =

t

and

t+1 to obtain

(B.2)

(t+1) —

(t)

e(t,t+1),

Ee(t,t+1) =

0.

In the continuous—time model, C is related to C by

(B.3)

(T) = j p(v)C(T—v)dv.

Combine (B.2) and (B.3) to get

(B.4)

e(t,t+1) =

p(v)C(t+1—v)dv —

J p(v)C(t—v)dv.

Now, consider the following step function as an approximation to p(v):

v < 1, (v) = p(1) if 1

v < 2, etc.

Then one obtains

APPENDIX C: Derviation of (4.6)

This appendix derives (4.6) under the assumption that A, the fraction of

constrained households in the sample, is an exogenously given constant. Write
the two equations (4.2) and (4.4) compactly as

(C.1)

y =

+v

for (4.2)

(C.2)

y =

+ w,

for (4.4)

where the subscript j is dropped for notational simplicity. Let a dummy
variable D take the value of unity if the household is constrained and zero if

the household follows the permanent income hypothesis. The expected value of
D is A.

The two equations can be combined into one equation

y = (1 —

D is independent of z1,z2,x,v,w, then the least squares projection of y on

E(ylx) = (1 —

FOOTNOTES

1. In this paper the permanent income hypothesis is taken to mean that
households optimize their intertemporal utility function subject to the
lifetime budget constraint.

2. See King (1983) for a survey of recent contributions.

3. This example is due to Larry Summers.

4. The survey also has data on the amount of money that is given to members
of the family other than the head. This is not considered in the analysis

of this paper. The expenditure data refer to the full cost of purchases
even though full payment may not have been made at the date of purchase.

5. No data on education are available. This is characteristic of most
surveys in Japan.

6. The reason for doing this is to treat homeowners and nonhomeowners
symmetrically. This paper will work with changes in expenditures.
Although the survey does not report imputed rents for homeowners, this
will disappear when expenditure changes are taken.

7. One case reported about 3.8 million yen for "other expenses" in period

1. This was a clear outlier. (The next highest value was about 1.2
million yen.) Four cases reported temporary income for period 1 in excess
of 10 million yen. If these four cases are included, the sample standard
deviation of temporary income in period 1 nearly quadruples, although the
results to be reported in this paper are not changed in any important way

(except for the results on temporary income). Another case reported
temporary income in excess of 10 million yen in period 2. The remaining
seventh case reported expected normal income for period 5 of 19,890

thousand yen. Since its actual normal income in periods 1,2,3 and 4 is
1,980 thousand yen, I concluded that the number was wrong by one decimal
point.

— 42 —

8.

For the commodity—specific number of equivalent adults, see Deaton and
Muelbauer (1980).

9. The Annual Report on the Survey of Family Consumption (The Economic
Planning Agency) reports quarterly time—seri.es data from 1977:Q2 on

average expenditures on the ten commodity groups. I estimated the
multiplicative model of seasonality using this time—series data and then
used the resulting seasonality factor to perform seasonal adjustment on
the present data set.

10. If the real interest rate is equal to the rubjective discount rate and if
the instantaneous utility function is quadratic, then change in

consumption is white noise, as Hall (1978) has shown. If, in addition,
the first—order coefficients in the quadratic utility function is subject
to taste shocks, then change in consumption is a white noise process plus

a moving average of taste shocks, This was pointed out to me by Robert
Flood.

11. The Family Income and Expenditure Survey, compiled by the Prime
Minister's Office of Japan, is a diary survey on monthly expenditures on

over several hundred commodity groups. Since one—sixth of the sample is
replaced by new households every month, it is possible to create a six—

month panel of monthly expenditures. A forthcoming study done at the
Economic Planning Agency contains calculation of the autocorrelation

coefficients for monthly expenditure changes. The first order auto—
correlation coefficient for food is close to —0.4 on average.

12. This VAR model is estimated on family size—unadjusted data because I
thought the interpretation of the VAR coefficients became more

straightforward. The coefficients estimated on family size—adjusted data
are virtually identical. The significance of the lag coefficients is

determined by heteroskedasticity—robust standard errors. See section 4
for more details on how to calculate them. Four additional variables ——
AGE, AGE2, FSZ4 — FSZ3 and (FSZ4 — FSZ3)2 —— are also included on the
right—hand side of the equations, but their estimated coefficients are not
reported in Table 5. The lagged expenditure coefficients in the YT

— 43 —

("temporary"

income) equation are large in absolute value. This is due to

seasonality in YT. If seasonally adjusted data on expenditures and income
are used, the coefficients become must smaller in absolute value.

13. To economize notation, bequests are not considered, although it is
straightforward to do so.

14. So the omission of leisure in our model does not seem to cause any
serious problem. Anyway, there are to data on labor supply in the present
data set.

15. This is pointed Out in Chamberlain (1982). Suppose, for example, there
is a totally unexpected income tax reform in period t that slashes the

marginal tax rates for the rich. The forecast error YDt —

YD

will be

positive for the rich and negative for the poor. So the correlation

between YD —
—1

plim N

N÷

YD
N
L

i=1

and YDt_l across households, which equals
e

(YDI _YD)YD,_i

(where N is the sample size and i indexes households), is positive. The
mean of forecast errors can also differ from zero, because everyone can be

wrong

in

the same direction at any given point in time. The household

subscript i has been dropped in the text.

16. The intercept term also depends on the after—tax real rate

Since

interest income is virtually tax—free in Japan, it is reasonable to assume

that r,+i is the same across households.

17. In what follows, I will ignore taste shocks. The implication of taste
shocks for parameter estimtes will be discussed in the last paragraph of
section 5.

18. Unexpected expenditure changes in other commodities, cft —

c(Z

could also be used as instruments in estimating the equation for commodity

j, but they are almost uncrorrelated with actual expenditure changes on
commodity j and so no significant efficiency gain will be accomplished.

— 44 —

19.

The time—series estimates in Table 11 assume that the real rates are
constant over time.

20. Brown (1952)'s statement of the habit persistence hypothesis is as
follows:

...the lag effect in consumer demand was produced by the

consumption habits which people formed as a result of past consumption.
The habits, customs, standards, and levels associated with real consumption previously enjoyed become 'impressed' on the human physcological and
psychological systems and this produces an inertia or 'hysteresis' in

consumer behavior." Brown summarizes his hypothesis in his equation 4:

C

= a0 + a1Y + a9C1 + u, where Y is current income and C_1 is lagged con—
sumpt ion.

21.

Changes from period 3 to period 4 are considered because actual changes
from period 4 to period 5 are unobservable.

22. The lag coefficients for food expenditures in Table 12 are considerably
larger than those in Tables 7 and 9. This is probably due to multipli-

cative

seasonality. The dependent variable in Table 12 is expenditure

change from the fourth quarter to the first quarter of the following

year. The first lag is expenditure change from the third to the fourth
quarter, which is strongly negatively correlated with the dependent
variable because of the high level of expenditures In the fourth quarter.
The use of the data that are adjusted for multiplicative seasonality did

produce smaller point estimates for the lag coefficients for food. There
are, however, costs associated with the use of seasonally adjusted data.
The formula (3.3) that links expenditures to cnsumpution should be in non—

seasonally adjusted data. It does not seem sensible to suppose the
equation (3.15) for liquidity constrained households holds on seasonally

adjusted data. Anyway, since there is not much seasonality in expenditures in the first and second quarters of the year, the results in Tables
7—9 are robust to multiplicative seasonality.

23. If expected and unexpected income changes rather than actual and
unexpected income changes are used, then the expected income change
coefficient will be .08 and the unexpected income change coefficient will

— 45 —

be .37.

24. See (A.4) in Appendix A for a derivation.
