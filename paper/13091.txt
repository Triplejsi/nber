Rise of 401(k) Plans, Lifetime Earnings, and Wealth at Retirement

ABSTRACT
Saving through private pensions has been an important complement to Social Security in providing
for the financial needs of older Americans. In the past twenty five years, however, there has been
a dramatic change in private retirement saving. Personal retirement accounts have replaced defined
benefit pension plans as the primary means of retirement saving. It is important to understand how
this change will affect the wealth of future retirees. The personal retirement account system is not
yet mature. A person who retired in 2000, for example, could have contributed to a 401(k) for at most
18 years and the typical 401(k) participant had only contributed for a little over seven years. Nonetheless,
current 401(k) assets are quite large. We consider in this paper the implications of rising 401(k) saving
through the year 2040. In particular, we emphasize the growth of the sum of Social Security wealth
and 401(k) assets for families in each decile of the Social Security wealth distribution. Our projections
show a substantial increase between 2000 and 2040 in the sum of these retirement assets in each wealth
decile. We also consider the accumulation of 401(k) assets by families in different deciles of the distribution
of lifetime earnings.

Over the past two and a half decades there has been a fundamental
change in the way people save for retirement in the United States. There has
been a rapid shift from saving through employer-managed defined benefit (DB)
pensions to defined contribution (DC) retirement saving plans that are largely
controlled by employees. Just two or three decades ago, employer-provided DB
plans were the primary means of saving for retirement in the United States. But
since that time, 401(k) and other personal retirement accounts have become the
principal form of retirement saving in the private sector. More than 80 percent of
private retirement plan contributions in 2000 and 2001 were to 401(k) and other
personal accounts. DB plans have remained an important form of retirement
saving for federal employees and for state and local employees, although even
for these employees personal retirement accounts are becoming increasingly
important. Contributions to personal retirement plans accounted for only 12
percent of total contributions to Federal pension plans in 2000, but had increased
to 17 percent by 2004. We do not have quantitative data on state and local DC
plans but anecdotal evidence suggests that contributions to these plans are
growing rapidly as well. This transition to personal retirement saving has
important implications for the well-being of the elderly and perhaps for design
changes in Social Security as well.
In Poterba, Venti, and Wise (2007a), we described the rise of 401(k) plans
and the implications of this rise for the flow of assets into and out of 401(k) plans
over the next four decades. In Poterba, Venti, and Wise (2007b) we described
the decline in DB plans and assessed the implications of the decline for the flow
of assets into and out of DB plans over the next four decades. Our projections
suggest that the average (over all persons) present value of real DB benefits at
age 65 achieved a maximum in 2003, when this value was $72,637 (in year 2000
dollars), and then began to decline. The projections also suggest that by 2010
the average level of 401(k) assets at age 65 will exceed the average present
value of DB benefits at age 65. Thereafter the value of 401(k) assets grows
rapidly, attaining levels much greater than the historical maximum present value
of DB benefits. If equity returns between 2006 and 2040 are comparable to
those observed historically, by 2040 average projected 401(k) assets of all
persons age 65 will be over six times larger than the maximum level of DB
benefits for a 65 year old achieved in 2003 (in year 2000 dollars). Even if equity
returns average 300 basis points below their historical value, we project that
average 401(k) assets in 2040 would be 3.7 times as large as the value of DB
benefits in 2003.
These analyses consider changes in the aggregate level of pension
assets. Although the projections indicate that the average level of retirement
assets will grow very substantially over the next three or four decades, it is also
clear that the accumulation of assets in 401(k)-like plans will vary across
households. Whether a person has a 401(k) plan is strongly related to income.
Low-income employees are much less likely than higher-income employees to be
covered by a 401(k) or similar type of tax-deferred personal account plan. Thus

2

In this paper we focus on the accumulation of 401(k) assets by lifetime earnings
deciles. Because we are interested in the relationship between Social Security
wealth and the future change in 401(k) assets, we also consider the
accumulation of 401(k) assets by Social Security wealth deciles. We consider in
particular how the combined accumulation of Social Security and 401(k) assets
will change over the next three and a half decades.
In section 1 we set out background data that helps to put in context the
projections we present in this paper. In section 2 we set out the method that we
use to project 401(k) assets. In section 3 we describe the average level of 401(k)
assets for cohorts that attain retirement age in each year through 2040. In
section 4 we describe the rise in 401(k) assets by lifetime earning deciles and by
Social Security wealth deciles and then consider how the total of Social Security
and 401(k) assets will change between 2000 and 2040.
1. Background
We describe first the relationship between age and earnings, and current
401(k) eligibility and participation rates. We then describe current levels of
dedicated retirement assets—Social Security and private pensions—for persons
near retirement age.
Table 1-1 shows 401(k) plan eligibility and participation rates by annual
earnings and by age in 2003, based on data from the Survey of Income and
Program Participation (SIPP). The table shows 401(k) eligibility and participation
rates for families that have been created by matching SIPP data for persons.
The "age" of the family is the age of the reference person. A family participates
in (is eligible for) a 401(k) plan if either spouse participates in (is eligible for) a
401(k) plan. The sample is restricted to families with positive earnings in 2003.
These eligibility and participation rates pertain to all employer-based 401(k)-like
saving plans, but exclude participation in Keogh and IRA plans. Eligibility rates
do not differ much by age. But families with low earnings are much less likely
than families with higher earnings to be covered by 401(k) plans. Over 87% of
families with earnings greater than $100,000 per year were eligible for a 401(k)
plan; less than 36% of families with earnings less than $25,000 per year were
eligible. Participation follows a similar pattern. About 80 percent of families with
annual earning over $100,000 participate; about 20 percent of families with
earning less than $25,000 participate.
It is likely that in the future 401(k) participation rates will also vary by
earnings and thus the level of 401(k) assets will vary by earnings. In other words,
there is likely to be a strong relationship between lifetime earnings and 401(k)
assets. Thus the level of 401(k) assets relative to Social Security wealth will also
vary greatly among families. In particular, the ratio of 401(k) assets to the
present value of Social Security benefits is likely to be highest among families
with greater Social Security benefits.

Table 1-2 shows average dedicated retirement assets in 2000 for
households with heads 63 to 67 by “lifetime earnings” deciles. Unlike Table 1-1,
this table includes families in which no member is employed, as well as families
that include an employed person. Dedicated retirement assets include DB and
401(k) pension wealth as well as Social Security wealth and balances in IRA and
Keogh plans. These estimates are based data from the Health and Retirement
Study (HRS). They pertain to families comprised of persons for whom the HRS
obtained Social Security earnings records. The earnings are corrected for the
Social Security earnings limit, as described in the appendix. The calculations for
each asset category are also explained in the appendix.
There are several key features of the data. First, the category "401(k)
assets" includes all 401(k)-like plans, such as 403(b) plans, 457 plans, employee
stock option plans, supplemental retirement accounts, thrift saving plans, stock
and profit sharing plans, money purchase plans, as well as traditional employerprovided DC plans. Second, for this age group in particular, 401(k) and IRA
assets must be considered jointly. A large fraction of assets in IRA plans are
“rollovers” from 401(k) plans. Many new retirees “rollover” 401(k) assets into an
IRA plan when they retire or have "rolled over" 401(k) assets into an IRA in the
past when they changed jobs. For example, 89 percent of flows into IRA
accounts were rollovers in 1996, 89 percent in 1997, 93 percent in 1998, 95

4

percent in 1999, and 96 percent were rollovers in 2000.1 In the subsequent
analyses we present projections of 401(k) assets, including assets that would
have been rolled over into IRA accounts. Third, the sum of 401(k) and IRA assets
is large, greater than average DB assets for all deciles combined. But even for
the lower lifetime earnings deciles the amounts in personal retirement accounts
are substantial. Recall that IRA and 401(k) plans were introduced in 1982 so that
households whose heads were 63 to 67 in 2000, could have contributed for at
most 18 years to such plans. Copeland (2004) reports that persons with IRA
accounts in 2001 had contributed an average of 8.2 years and persons with
401(k) plans in 2001 had contributed an average of 7.2 years.
Fourth, both dedicated retirement assets and total wealth increase
noticeably with lifetime earnings, as would be expected. Below we consider the
ratio of assets and total wealth to lifetime earnings and find that this ratio does
not show a systematic relationship to lifetime earnings.
Table 1-3 is similar to Table 1-2 except that the deciles are defined by
Social Security wealth (the discounted present value of expected Social Security
benefits) instead of lifetime earnings. A noticeable feature of these data is that
households in the lowest Social Security wealth decile have relatively large
personal pension wealth—$138,576 in non-Social Security dedicated retirement
assets, compared to $88,697 for households in the lowest lifetime earnings
decile. In addition, this group has an average of $334,207 in total wealth,
somewhat greater than the total wealth of households in the lowest lifetime
earnings decile. This apparent anomaly is, in part, a consequence of our
measurement of lifetime earnings, which is based on Social Security earnings
records. Some households were likely not eligible for Social Security over their
entire working lives. Thus In some years a person may have worked in a job not
covered by the Social Security system. Earnings in these years are not included
in the Social Security earnings records and thus not included in our measure of
lifetime earnings. Thus actual earnings may be greater than measured earnings,
particularly in the lowest lifetime earnings decile.

Finally, in Table 1-4 we show ratio of dedicated retirement assets to
lifetime earnings and the ratio of total wealth to lifetime earnings. We consider
these ratios by lifetime earnings decile (the left three columns of the table) and by
Social Security wealth decile (the right three columns of the table). Recall that
our “lifetime earnings” are based on earnings reported to the Social Security
Administration. Persons who were never covered by Social Security are not in
the data. Persons who were covered by Social Security for only a portion of their
working lives are in the data, but for some their actual earnings may be
considerably larger than Social Security earnings. The difference between actual
and Social Security earnings is likely to be the greatest for persons with low
reported Social Security earnings, as discussed below.
Consider first the ratios by lifetime earnings decile, which are graphed in
Figure 1-1 (excluding the data for the lowest decile). The ratio of dedicated
retirement assets to lifetime earnings (shown as dark bars in the figure) in the
fourth to the tenth deciles varies only between 0.20 and 0.27. The variation in
the ratio of total wealth to lifetime earnings is, to us, also surprisingly small over
the fourth to the tenth deciles, ranging from 0.34 to 0.45. These data suggest
that when dedicated retirement assets at age 65 are compared to lifetime
earnings, the “retirement replacement rate” does not vary greatly by lifetime
income. The data also seem to suggest that the total “saving rate” (including
Social Security, housing wealth, and non-retirement financial assets) may not
vary greatly by lifetime earnings deciles and in particular that the saving rate may
not increase systematically with lifetime earnings. However, we emphasize the
accumulation of retirement assets and not the saving rate as typically measured.
There has been considerable analysis of this issue by others and we do not
pursue the question further here.2
Since we are particularly interested in the relationship between Social
Security wealth and other assets, we want to consider the ratios for deciles
defined by Social Security wealth. They are shown in the last three columns of
Table 1-4 and are graphed in Figure 1-2. The ratio of dedicated retirement
assets to lifetime earnings within Social Security wealth deciles ranges from a
low of 0.20 in the seventh decile to 0.29 in the second decile, with no systematic
pattern by decile. The ratio of total wealth to lifetime earnings ranges from 0.35
in the seventh decile to 0.58 in the first decile. Families with the lowest Social
Security wealth accumulate more total wealth (relative to lifetime earnings) than
families with greater Social Security wealth.
From Table 1-4 it can be seen that lifetime earnings by Social Security
wealth decile, differ from lifetime earnings by lifetime earnings deciles. For
2

Gustman and Steinmeier (1999) and Venti and Wise (1998) find a relatively flat
wealth to lifetime earnings profile. Dynan, Skinner, and Zeldes (2004) find an
upward sloping profile. They also present a comprehensive review of the
literature on this topic.

8

example, the average of lifetime earnings in the lowest lifetime earnings decile is
$70,993, but the average of lifetime earnings for families in the lowest Social
Security wealth decile is $580,433. That is, many families with the lowest Social
Security wealth have lifetime earnings well above the lowest lifetime earnings
decile; the average within the lowest Social Security wealth decile is just below
the average in the third earnings decile. Again, this apparent anomaly seems to
be due to persons who were not covered by Social Security over their entire
working lives and thus had low Social Security wealth even though they had
substantial lifetime earnings over the period that earnings were reported to the
Social Security Administration.

In the subsequent sections of this paper we consider how the rise of
401(k) plans will change the accumulation of assets at retirement. In particular
we consider how 401(k) assets within lifetime earning deciles and within Social
Security wealth deciles will change over time. For the purposes of this paper we
assume that future generations of retirees will receive the same Social Security
benefits, and thus have the same Social Security wealth, as current retirees (in
year 2000 dollars). Of course, the Social Security benefit formula will likely be
different for retirees in 2040 than for retirees in 2006. We begin in the next
section by explaining how we project 401(k) assets in the future. We then
describe projections by lifetime earnings decile and by Social Security wealth
decile. In particular we show how the level of assets shown in Tables 1-2 and 13 change with the rise in 401(k) assets.

2. Projecting 401(k) Assets at Retirement
In Poterba, Venti, and Wise (2007a), we developed projections of
aggregate 401(k) assets in future years. In this paper, we consider how the
accumulation of 401(k) assets varies across families with different lifetime
earnings histories. In this section, we borrow liberally from the discussion in the
earlier paper to explain how the projections are developed, but here we add
additional detail about the projection of participation rates by earnings.
We first set out the calculations that are the basis for our projections of
401(k) wealth. We denote persons by the subscript i . Cohorts are denoted by
subscript c . Associated with each person in each cohort is a lifetime earnings

i in cohort c at age a are denoted by Eci ( a ) .
The zero-one indicator that person i in cohort c participates in a 401(k) plan at
age a is denoted by Pci ( a ) , the rate of return earned on 401(k) assets that were
profile. The earnings of person

held at the beginning of the year when the person attained age a is denoted
by Rci ( a ) , and the contribution rate is denoted be C (expressed as a proportion
of earnings). The value of the 401(k) assets held by person
a is given by

i

 j =0
Cci ( a − t ) = Eci ( a − t ) ⋅ Pci ( a − t ) ⋅ c , This calculation is made for every
a

(1)

where
person (i.e. earnings history) fore every age in every cohort. In practice,
separate calculations are made for wealth in stocks and bonds and the assumed
rates of return do not vary by individual. In particular, the 401(k) wealth of
person i in cohort c at 65 is given by

 t

Wci (65) = ∑ ∏ [1 + Rci (65 − j )] Cci (65 − t )

t =0 
 j =0
65

(2)

This accumulation is calculated for each person (earnings history) in our sample.
We then obtain the average wealth held by the population of all persons
age 65 for a cohort c . To do this we need to know how many persons of type
i are in the population. Denote the number of persons with lifetime earnings
profile i in cohort c at age 65 by N ci (to be determined by population projections).
Then the average of 401(k) assets held by all persons in cohort c at age 65 is
given by



where J is the number of persons (earnings histories) in the sample. In practice,
we don’t have population forecasts associated with each earnings history in the
sample. Instead, we project total assets using population projections for groups
of persons with the same demographic characteristics. The Office of the Actuary
of the Social Security Administration has developed population projections by
calendar year and age and by gender and marital status. Each earnings history
in our sample can also be identified by the gender and marital status of the
person. We first calculate the average of Wci (65) separately for each of the four
gender-marital status pairs and denote this average by W c , gm . Then the average
wealth at 65 for each cohort is determined by

 ∑ c, j

 j =1


where the sum is over the four gm (gender-marital-status groups) and the
number of persons in each of these groups is taken from the Social Security
Administration demographic projections.
To implement these calculations we need to develop projections of future
401(k) participation rates and earnings and we need to make assumptions about
future 401(k) contribution rates, rates of return, cash-out probabilities, and 401(k)
withdrawals. We begin by describing projections of average 401(k) participation
rates for each cohort. We then describe the other assumptions that are needed
to obtain estimates of 401(k) asset accumulation.
.
Average participation rates: We use data from the SIPP to track the
spread of 401(k) plans over the past two decades and to develop projections of
future 401(k) assets. Various SIPP surveys enable us to collect data on
participation in (and eligibility for) 401(k) plans in 1984, 1987, 1991, 1993, 1995,
1998, and 2003. Each SIPP survey is a random cross section sample of the
population. The cross-section data can be used to create “synthetic” cohorts.

12

For example, to construct cohort data for the cohort that was age 25 in 1984 we
use the 1984 panel to obtain data for persons 25 in that year, the 1987 panel to
obtain data for persons who were 28 in that year, the 1991 panel to obtain data
for persons who were 32 in that year, and so forth. The cohort that was 25 in
1984 was 44 in 2003. We sometimes label a cohort by the age of the cohort in
1984 and sometimes by the year in which the cohort attains age 65. For
example, the cohort that is age 25 in 1984 attains age 65 in 2024 and is referred
to as the C25 or the R2024 cohort. The unit of observation in the SIPP is an
individual and our projections of 401(k) participation rates are made at the
individual level. For some later analyses we aggregate individual-level results to
show projections for families.
We begin with historical participation rates for individuals by cohort, as
shown in Figure 2-1. The earliest SIPP data are for 1984 and the most recent
data are for 2003. We will use these data to project 401(k) participation at ages
25 through 65 for a large number of cohorts, ranging from the cohort that attains
age 65 in 1982 through the cohort that attains age 65 in 2040. Only a few of the
cohorts (shown in the bottom right of Figure 2-1) had attained age 65 by 2003.
Thus for all but a few of the cohorts we must project participation rates from the
last observed age in 2003 to age 65.
The participation rate is the eligibility rate times the participation rate given
eligibility. The future eligibility rate will depend in particular on the spread of
401(k) plans to small employers. We know that eligibility rates have increased
very rapidly over the past two decades, and that participation, given eligibility,
increased substantially over the 1984 to 2003 period, as shown in Poterba, Venti,
and Wise (2007a). We have not found a compelling way to formally project
future rates of eligibility or participation conditional on eligibility. Thus we have
simply made “plausible” assumptions about future participation rates and use
them to project future cohort participation rates for persons in cohorts not
covered in the SIPP data.

Simple extrapolations of the cohort data are likely to yield implausibly
large participation rates. Consider, for example, the participation rates at age 44
highlighted by the vertical dashed line in Figure 2-1. The C44 cohort attained
age 44 in 1984 and had a participation rate of 5.8 percent at that time. The C25
cohort attained age 44 in 2003, 19 years later, and had a participation rate of
44.3 percent. On average, the participation rate at age 44 increased about 2
percentage points with each successively younger cohort. Were this rate to
continue, the participation rate of the C12 cohort at age 44 (that the C12 cohort
will attain in 2016) would be 70.3 percent (44.3+13x2). We suspect that this
estimate of the future participation rate is too high, because 401(k) plans have
already diffused through the segments of the corporate population that have
workforces that find these plans most attractive, and that have the lowest peremployee administrative costs of implementing a plan.
Estimation of cohort effects by fitting the above profiles shows some
compression with successively younger cohorts. In addition, Figure 2-1 suggests
that within cohorts, the increase in participation rates was lower between the last
two data points for each cohort, 1998 and 2003, than for earlier intervals of
comparable length. These features of the data suggest that the rate of growth of
401(k) participation may be slowing.

To recognize the apparent compression in the cohort effects and the
apparent decline in the rate of within cohort increase in participation rates, we
make future projections for each cohort based on its observed 2003 participation
rate. We assume that the annual increase in future participation rate will be
smaller than that between 1998 and 2003. In particular, we assume that the
future annual rate of increase declines by 0.12 percent per year. With this
assumption, the projected future participation rates for the C25 and the C12
cohorts would be as shown in Figure 2-2, which also shows the actual
participation rates for these cohorts in 2003 and earlier years. Based on these
projections, the participation rate of the C12 cohort when it attains age 44 in 2016
would be 61.7 percent, compared to 44.3 percent for the C25 cohort, which
attained age 44 in 2003. At age 64, the participation rate would be 56.6 percent
for the C25 cohort and 69.4 percent for the C12 cohort.
Figure 2-3 shows the projected average participation rates for selected
cohorts from C11 (R2038) to C64 (R1985). The figure also shows the
interpolated participation rates between the years for which data are available
prior to 2003. The decline in the rate of growth of 401(k) participation between
1998 and 2003 (the last two years for which SIPP data are available) is
noticeable for many of the cohorts shown in the figure. The figure shows
projections for selected cohorts. The projection algorithm we use includes
projections for all cohorts from C65 (R1984) through C9 (R2040).
Participation rates by earnings: Figure 2-3 shows projections of the
average 401(k) participation rate by age and cohort. Participation rates also
increase with earnings, given age and cohort. As with projections of average
participation rate by age and cohort, we know of no compelling way to project
rates by earnings level. Thus we use a procedure that we believe yields
plausible results. In particular, we believe that the procedure yields plausible
variation in asset accumulation by earnings, indicating the order of magnitude of
differences that are likely to occur.
We begin with SIPP data on 401(k) participation in 2003. We first
calculate participation rates by earnings decile within 5-year age intervals
beginning with age 25 to age 30 and ending with age 60 to age 65. These rates
are shown in the top panel of Table 2-1. One feature of these data that we rely
on in making projections is that the average participation rate within an age
interval is typically close to the 5th decile participation rate within that interval.
And the overall participation rate is close to the overall participation rate for the
5th decile. We fit these participation rates with a probit model, allowing estimation
of separate coefficients by earnings decile within each of the eight 5-year age
intervals. We then calculate the probit coefficients for each earnings decile for the
average participation rates (over all age groups). These probit coefficients are
shown by the markers in Figure 2-4. The average effects can be fitted very well
by a third order polynomial as shown in the figure.

The fitted relationship between average participation rates by earnings
decile can be used to fit the participation rates for each of the age intervals. For
example, suppose we want to estimate the participation rates for persons in the
60 to 65 age interval. We follow this procedure: First, we determine the constant
term in the polynomial fit (Figure 2-4) such that the predicted probability for the
5th decile for the 60 to 65 age interval is equal to the average probability for this
age interval (0.432). Then using this constant term, we use the polynomial to
determine the probit coefficient for each of the other earnings deciles. The
corresponding fitted participation probabilities are shown under the 60-65
heading in the second panel of Table 2-1. The fitted probabilities for each of the
other age intervals are also shown in the second panel of the table. We judge
that on average the fitted participation rates by age interval are rather close to
the actual participation rates.

Earnings decile

These estimated probit coefficients are used to project 401(k) participation
rates by earnings decile for a given age within a cohort in future years. In
particular, we assume that the average projected participation rate (as discussed
in the section above and illustrated in Figure 2-3) corresponds to the participation
rate of the 5th earnings decile. Consider for example, the participation rates at
age 60. Figure 2-3 shows the projected average (over all earnings deciles)
participation rate at age 60 for several cohorts. We want to project participation
rates for each earnings decile at age 60 for each of these cohorts. Following the
procedure describe above, we first determine the constant term in the polynomial
fit (in Figure 2-3) such that the participation rate in the 5th earnings decile is equal
to the average projected participation rate. Then using the polynomial with this
constant term we predict the participation rate for each of the earnings deciles.
Table 2-2 shows the projected participation rates for persons age 60 in cohorts
retiring in 2000, 2010 2020, 2030, and 2040. The average projected rate is
shown in the first row of the table labeled "All"). The remaining rows show
projected participation rates for each earnings decile. The probit procedure
insures that the projected participation rates by earnings decile are in the 0 to 1
interval. The increase in the participation rate in the 10th decile is from 65.7 in
2000 to 88.8 percent in 2040. The implied increase in the 1st decile is rather
large, from 15.3 in 2000 to 41.6 percent in 2040. Thus there is some
compression of the variation in participation rates by earnings decile. Whether
this implication in particular is plausible depends on the spread of 401(k) plans to
small firms with low-wage employees over the next three or four decades.
Clearly, the results depend on the participation rate and other assumption we
have made.

Asset Allocation and Rate of Return: We assume that 60 percent of
401(k) contributions are allocated to large-capitalization equities and 40 percent
to corporate bonds. The projections use actual annual pre-tax returns through
2005. Beginning in 2006 we make projections based on two rate of return
assumptions. First, we assume that the average annual nominal return on
equities is 12 percent and that the average nominal return on corporate bonds is
6 percent. Ibbotson Associates (2006) reports that the historical arithmetic mean
of pretax returns on long-term corporate bonds has been 6.2 percent per year,
while large-capitalization stocks have returned an average of 12.3 percent over
the period 1926-2005. Second, we assume that the rate of return on equities is
300 basis points less than the historical rate. These returns are the pretax
returns available on a portfolio with no management fees. We have not as yet
accounted for asset management fees. The average dollar weighted
management fee on stock funds is currently about 70 basis points.
Job Separation, Lump Sum Distributions, and Cashouts: At age 25
each person is assigned to a 401(k) job based on the participation probability for
that person's age, cohort and earnings. In subsequent years each person either
remains in the 401(k) job or leaves the 401(k) job. Job separation rates are
estimated from the 1998 SIPP for five-year age intervals. These rates are shown
in the first column of Table 2-3. Separation rates are allowed to vary by age, but
not by time in job. Estimated annual rates range from a high of 23 percent for the
youngest workers to 12.1 percent for workers age 50 to 54. After leaving a
401(k) job persons enter a pool of “non-participants.” In each year members of
19

this pool are selected for a new 401(k) job at a rate that makes the overall
participation rate for persons of a particular age and cohort equal to the projected
probability for that age and cohort. A similar projection algorithm, with an identical
treatment of transitions in and out of 401(k) participation, is described in Poterba,
Venti, and Wise [2001].
The probability that a 401(k) accumulation is cashed out is determine by
the job separation rate, the probability that the employees takes a lump sum
distribution (LSD), and the probability that a lump sum distribution is cashed out
rather than rolled over into an IRA. That is, the probability of a cashout is given
by:

Pr [ cashout ] = Pr [ job separation] ∗ Pr [ LSD ] ∗ Pr [ LSD cashout ]

The probabilities associated with each of the components of the cashout decision
are shown in Table 2-3.

*Authors' calculation based on SIPP data.
**From Hurd, Lilliard, and Panis (1998), based on HRS data.

When employees separate from a job they may choose to keep their
accumulation with their old employer or they may decide to take a LSD. The
SIPP only provides information on the disposition of a LSD. Thus we are unable
to obtain the probability of a LSD given job separation by age from the SIPP. We
use the average rate of 57 percent obtained by Hurd, Lilliard, and Panis based

20

on data from the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS). On average, the
probability of a cashout in a given year is (.151) x (.570) x (.272) = 0.0234.
This cashout probability differs from the probability in Poterba, Venti, and
Wise (2001). In that paper, the average was about 0.0108. The principle reason
for the difference is the job separation rates. In the earlier paper we used
estimates based on retrospective information in the HRS. The average
separation rate based on that source was 0.048, compared to the average rate of
0.151 based on the SIPP estimates.3 In the earlier paper our average estimate
of the (probability of a LSD) x (probability of cashout | LSD) was 0.226. The
average of these two components used here is somewhat smaller: (.570) x
(.272) = 0.155.
Withdrawals: The projections reported here assume a crude withdrawal
scheme. Annual withdrawals are assumed to be 2 percent of balances between
ages 65 and 70 ½. At older ages, the amount withdrawn from the 401(k) is
(1/Remaining Life Expectancy) times the 401(k) balance. These withdrawal
assumptions likely overstate amounts withdrawn from 401(k) plans. Berkshadker
and Smith [2005] show that over 50 percent of current IRA holders do not make
their first withdrawal before age 70.
Earnings: To estimate the 401(k) contributions of a cohort, we need to
determine the earnings and the contribution rates of cohort members. The key to
developing an earnings history is access to a long time series of earnings by a
single individual or a family. We use the HRS, that provides linked Social
Security earnings histories for respondents who agreed to the link. These data
represent earnings histories for a sample of individuals who were between the
ages of 52 and 61 in 1992. The implicit assumption in our analysis is that the
distribution of earnings histories that will be realized by younger cohorts will be
similar to the earnings histories of the HRS respondents.
To develop earnings histories for younger cohorts we begin with the Social
Security earnings histories of the HRS respondents, available for the years 1961
through 1991.4 Earnings for 1992 through 2000 are obtained directly from HRS
respondents. We begin with the earnings of the cohorts that attained age 65 in
1998, 1999, and 2000. We obtain lifetime earnings for all single persons that
attained age 65 in these years and for all persons in two-person families in which
the male partner attained age 65 in these years. The earnings of the 1998 cohort
are “aged” two years and the earnings of the 1999 cohort are "aged" one year,
based on the Social Security average wage index. We then treat these earnings
3

The estimate of 15.1 percent is approximately 5 percent lower than estimates
reported by Stewart [2002], based on Current Population Survey data.

We used a two-limit tobit specification (with a separate equation for each year)
to impute SS earnings for persons censored at the upper Social Security
earnings limit.
21

histories as a random sample of the earnings of the cohort that attained age 65 in
2000 (the “R2000” cohort). The sample reports actual earnings histories,
including years with zero earnings, so it recognizes that individuals may not be
employed in some years. We implicitly assume that the employment rate and the
distribution of employment by age are similar for future cohorts as for past ones.
(The “R2000” cohort contains some female spouses who were not 65 in 2000.)
To make projections for the earnings of younger cohorts, we inflate the
“R2000” sample using the intermediate earnings growth assumptions reported in
the 2005 Annual report of the Board of Trustees of the Social Security
Administration. Similarly, to project a sample of earnings for older cohorts we
deflate the earning of the “R2000” cohort based on the Social Security average
wage index. This method does not account for any potential change in the
relative earnings of high and low-wage persons.
Contribution Rate: We assume a contribution rate of 10 percent of
earnings, including both the employee and the employer contributions. There are
several sources of information on contribution rates. Data from the 2003 SIPP
are shown by age interval in Table 2-4. The overall median of the total of
employee and employer contributions is 9.8 percent. The employee and
employer medians are 5.7 percent and 3.0 percent respectively. The overall
mean is 12.6 percent. The mean rates may be substantially affected by reporting
errors.

Poterba, Venti, and Wise (1998) reported contribution rates based on the
1993 Current Population Survey (CPS). The average employee contribution rate
was 7.1 percent and the average employer rate was 3.1 percent. The 1998 Form
5500 data show that about 32 percent of dollars are contributed by employers,
which is roughly consistent with the 2003 SIPP median percent and with the
1993 CPS values. Holden and VanDerHei (2001) analyzed the responses to an
Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI)-Investment Company Institute (ICI)
22

survey and report that in 1999 the average total contribution rate was 9.7
percent. Engelhardt and Cunningham (2002) report that based on HRS data the
average employee contribution rate was 6.6 percent in 1991, which is again
generally consistent with the estimates based on SIPP and on CPS data.
For several reasons, however, the contribution rate in future years is
uncertain. One reason for uncertainty about future contribution rates is the effect
of increases in contribution limits. Legislation over the past several years has
increased contribution limits very substantially and now future increases are
indexed to inflation. Our projections assume that contributions as a percent of
salary will be unaffected by the rising limits. In part, the effect of rising limits
depends on how many participants are constrained by the contribution limits now
and whether fewer participants or more participants will be constrained by future
limits. Holden and VanDerhei (2001) report that in 1999 eleven percent of
participants with incomes over $40,000 contributed at the legislated maximum,
thirteen percent of those with incomes between $70,000 and $80,000, and
eighteen percent of those with incomes between $80,000 and $90,000
contributed at the legislated maximum. Thus one question is how wage growth
will interact with rising limits to affect the proportion of persons at the limit. Even
though the limits have increased and are now indexed to the CPI, wages are
likely to increase faster than the CPI. The Social Security Administration
assumes future wage growth of 3.9 percent and future inflation of 2.8 percent.
The legislated maximum, however, may not be the effective limit for many
employees. Holden and VanDerhei (2001) report that 52 percent of participants
in 1999 faced employer imposed limits below the legislated maximum. The
number of participants that is constrained by these limits is unknown. And how
the limits set by employers might change in the future is also unknown.
In addition, we have not accounted for the recent Pension Protection Act
of 2006 that gives employers latitude to set more "saving friendly" defaults in
401(k) plans. Beshears, Choi, Laibson, and Madrian (2006) survey some of the
recent evidence on how changing defaults for enrollment, contribution rates, and
asset allocation can significantly increase retirement saving through 401(k) plans.
Thus our 401(k) projections may underestimate the actual accumulation of
assets in these plans. Finally, the legislated increases in contribution limits may
affect participant decisions of how much “should” be saved for retirement. The
government-set limits may serve to “frame” employee decisions.
3. Average 401(k) Assets at Retirement
The 401(k) projection algorithm discussed above is based on the earnings
histories and contribution rates of persons. In this section we present results
based on these data. In the next section, we combine results for persons to
present projected asset accumulation for families. The average per person of
401(k) assets at age 65 (in 2000 dollars) is shown in Figure 3-1, for cohorts
attaining age 65 in years 1982 through 2040 (R1982 to R2040). Two profiles are
23

shown, one assuming the average historical rate of return for equities and the
other assuming the historical rate less 300 basis points. The projected average
of 401(k) assets increases very substantially over the next 35 years. If the
historical rate of return on equities is assumed, the average increases from about
$29,000 in 2000, to $137,000 in 2020, to $452,000 by 2040 (all in year 2000
dollars). Assuming the historical rate of return on equities less 300 basis points,
the average increases from $29,000 in 2000 to $269,000 by 2040. The projected
increase is due to the increase in the participation rates of younger cohorts, to
real wage growth, and to the increase in the number of years that 401(k)
contributions were possible for successively younger cohorts. The 401(k)
program effectively began in 1982 so cohorts retiring before 2020 could were
unable to make contributions early in their working lives. Persons who attained
age 65 in 2000 could have contributed to a 401(k) plan for at most 18 years and
on average contributed for a little over seven years. For the cohort that will attain
age 65 in 2040, 401(k) plans will have been available over the entire working life.
Figure 3-2 shows the average of 401(k) assets at retirement for persons
who have 401(k) plans. For persons with plans, the average increases from
about $87,000 in 2000 to $580,000 by 2040 assuming historical rates of equity
return, and to $335,000 assuming historical returns less 300 basis points.

For comparison, the maximum average (over all persons) of the present
value of DB benefits at age 65 was about $73,000, attained in 2003. Thereafter
benefits in DB plans decline, based on the projections in Poterba, Venti, and
Wise (2007b). The comparison is shown in detail in Figure 3-3 that is the same
as Figure 3-1 but with the addition of the DB projections.
To check our projection algorithm, we compared our estimate of the mean
401(k) assets of persons who attained age 65 in 2000 with the mean 401(k)
assets of HRS respondents between the ages of 63 and 67 in 2000. The HRS
mean (for persons) is $25,892, compared to our projected mean of $29,708.
However, the mean 401(k) balance in the HRS excludes amounts that were
originally accumulated in 401(k) plans but later rolled into IRAs; our projected
401(k) balance includes amounts that were rolled over into an IRA. Thus it
appears that our projection is quite plausible compared to the HRS mean.
4. Future 401(K) Assets at Retirement by Lifetime Earnings Decile and by
Social Security Wealth Decile.
We first consider projections of 401(k) assets at retirement. We then
consider how combined Social Security and 401(k) wealth at retirement will
change in the coming decades.
Tables 4-1 and 4-2 show projected 401(k) assets at retirement. The
tables show projections assuming that historical equity returns will continue in the
future and assuming that future returns will be equal to historical returns less 300
basis points. Table 4-1 shows projections by lifetime earnings deciles: Table 4-2
shows projections by Social Security wealth deciles. The tables show assets for
families, determined by reforming the original HRS families for whom the
earnings histories were obtained.
There are several important features of these projections. First, as
expected, families in the lowest lifetime earnings decile accumulate very little in
401(k) assets.5 But this is not true for families in the lowest Social Security
5

Most of the “families” in the lowest lifetime earnings decile are single women
and all have zero or very low earnings. The mean lifetime earnings for families in
this decile is about $70,000, or an average of $1,700 (in year 2000 dollars) per
year. Those with zero lifetime earnings accumulate no 401(k) wealth. Others,
with low and intermittent earnings, have low 401(k) participation rates and if they
do participate have high cash-out rates. Thus they accumulate little or no 401(k)
wealth as well. However, many families in this decile are not poor. Despite zero
or low lifetime earnings, many have substantial Social Security wealth. This is
because many are apparently widowed or divorced and, although they not
entitled to Social Security benefits based on their own earnings, they are entitled
to substantial Social Security wealth based on survivor benefits. However, our
measure of lifetime earnings for these single-person families does not include the
26

wealth decile. Some families in the lowest Social Security wealth decile have
substantial lifetime earnings (as explained above) and on average accumulate
substantial 401(k) assets. Second, the average increase in 401(k) assets of
families is very large—from $43,764 in 2000 to $575,117 assuming historical
rates of return and from $43,764 to $348,284 assuming historical returns less
300 basis points.
Table 4-3 shows the ratio of 401(k) assets in 2040 to 401(k) assets in
2000. The ratios are shown by lifetime earnings decile in the top panel of the
table and by Social Security wealth decile in the bottom panel. Ratios are shown
for historical rates of equity return and for historical rates less 300 basis points.
The relative increase between 2000 and 2040 is substantially greater for the
lowest lifetime earnings deciles than for the highest deciles (excluding the lowest
decile for which projected 401(k) assets are zero in 2000). The ratios range from
81.1 in the 2nd decile to 7.5 in the 10th decile assuming historical rates of return
and from 50.4 in the 2nd decile to 4.7 in the 10th decile assuming historical rates
of return less 300 basis points.
The large relative increase for families in the lowest earnings deciles, is
due in large part to the very low assets in 2000. The large increase between
2000 and 2040 among families in the lowest lifetime earnings interval may be
especially sensitive to our assumptions about the spread 401(k) participation to
lower-income workers. Nonetheless, the projections suggest very large
increases in 401(k) retirement assets for families in all but the lowest lifetime
earnings decile. Even in the 2nd lifetime earnings decile projected assets by
2040 are quite large, $50,857 compared to $627 in 2000 assuming historical
rates of equity returns.
The relative increase in 401(k) assets by Social Security wealth decile
follows a very different pattern. Assuming that 401(k) assets increase with
lifetime earnings, the pattern reflects the lifetime earnings of families in each
Social Security wealth decile. There are several noticeable features of the
relative increases between 2000 and 2040. First, the growth of 401(k) assets is
substantial in all Social Security wealth deciles. Second, there is no systematic
pattern of the increase in 401(k) assets by Social Security wealth decile.
Although the lowest relative increase is for the 10th decile and the highest for the
2nd decile (assuming historical rates of return), there is no pattern in the growth
rates of 401(k) assets in the 2nd through 10th Social security wealth deciles. The
same findings hold if we assume historical return on equity less 300 basis points.
earnings of the former spouse, so our algorithm does not generate 401(k)
balances for the surviving spouse. In principal, these "401(k)-poor" surviving
spouses could be assigned the 401(k) assets of their former spouses, but we
cannot do this because the former spouse left the household before reaching age
65 in 2000 and is thus not in our sample.

One of our principal goals has been to understand how the rapid increase
in 401(k) assets will change the combined level of Social Security and 401(k)
assets. There are of course other assets that can be used for support in
retirement, but Social Security wealth and 401(k) assets will be the principal
dedicated retirement assets. Table 4-4 shows the sum of Social Security and
401(k) saving at age 65 in years 2000, 2010, 2020, 2030, and 2040 for each
decile of the lifetime earnings distribution. These projections assume that real
Social Security benefits will remain constant at their 2000 level. The top panel of
the table shows the sum of retirement assets assuming historical rates of equity
returns; the bottom panel shows the sum assuming historical rates less 300 basis
points. The increase in the sum of Social Security wealth and 401(k) assets is
30

large for all lifetime income deciles, except for the first decile. The average of the
sum of Social Security wealth and 401(k) assets increases from $225,593 in
2000 to $756,956 in 2040 assuming historical rates of return and from $225,593
to $530,113 assuming historical rates of return less 300 basis points (all in year
2000 dollars).
To help compare the increases across the lifetime earnings deciles, the
top panel of Table 4-6 shows the ratio of the sum of Social Security wealth and
401(k) assets in 2040 to the sum of Social Security wealth and 401(k) assets in
2000 for each lifetime wealth decile. The first column of the table shows the
ratios assuming historical rates of return and the second column shows the ratios
assuming historical rates less 300 basis points. On average, families in 2040 are
projected to have 3.36 times as much Social security and 401(k) wealth in 2040
as they had in 2000. In all but the first two deciles, real retirement assets more
than double between 2000 and 2040. However, the projections suggest
essentially no growth of total retirement assets among families in the very lowest
earnings decile. The projected increase is 50 percent among families in the
second lifetime earnings decile. The same patterns hold assuming historical
returns less 300 basis points.
The bottom panel of Table 4-6 shows the ratio of assets in 2040 to assets
in 2000 for each Social Security wealth decile. The increases for each of the
Social Security wealth deciles exhibit striking uniformity, except for the 1st decile.
The increase in the first decile is very large. Again, this apparently anomalous
ratio for the lowest Social Security wealth decile reflects the relatively low level of
projected 401(k) assets in 2000. The ratios are shown in Figure 4-1 for all but
the 1st decile. If historical equity returns continue in the future, the sum of Social
Security wealth and 401(k) assets will more than double between 2000 and
2040, for all Social Security wealth deciles. If future equity returns are equal to
the historical average less 300 basis points the ratio will be greater than 1.5 in all
deciles. Thus the rise of 401(k) plans significantly bolsters total retirement saving
for families with low Social security wealth as well as for families with high Social
security wealth. Similar patterns emerge (although the magnitudes are lower) if
we assume that future equity returns are 300 basis points less than their
historical average.

5. Summary and Discussion
We have projected the accumulation of 401(k) assets for families
retiring through 2040. Our goal has been to understand how the rise of personal
retirement saving plans will change the wealth of persons at retirement. In
particular, we compare the sum of Social Security wealth and 401(k) assets for
families that attain age 65 in 2000 to the sum of Social Security wealth and
401(k) assets in 2040. We consider the growth of retirement assets by Social
Security wealth decile as well as by lifetime earnings decile. Because the
projections are based on a series of assumptions with uncertain validity, the
projections are subject to considerable uncertainty. We believe, however, that
the projections provide a reasonable indicator of how the rise in 401(k) plans will
affect the total retirement assets of future retirees.
We have not emphasized DB pension benefits in these calculations
because our projections indicate that the proportion of retirement saving in DB
plans will decline substantially in the coming decades. In addition we have not
emphasized IRA assets, primarily because we are unable to distinguish assets
accumulated from IRA contributions from rollovers from 401(k) to IRA accounts.
Our 401(k) projections include such rollovers.
The 401(k) system is not yet fully mature. A person who retired in 2000,
for example, could have contributed to a 401(k) for at most 18 years and the
typical 401(k) participant had only contributed for a little over seven years. Even

35

current retirees could have contributed only in the latter half of their working lives.
Nonetheless, the current accumulation of 401(k) assets is substantial.
Projections in Poterba, Venti, and Wise (2007a) show that in 2007 401(k) assets
at age 65 were over 60 percent of the total of 401(k) and DB assets. By 2040,
the projections show that 401(k) assets will be between 4.30 and 6.85 times as
large as DB assets. The private pension system is moving from a DB to a
personal account system and workers who retire three decades from now will
have had the opportunity to contribute to a 401(k) plan over their entire working
lives (as many as 40 years in our projections).
How will the maturing of the 401(k) system affect the sum of the Social
Security wealth and 401(k) assets of future retirees? Our projections show that if
the historical rate of equity return continues in the future then, on average, the
sum of family Social Security wealth plus the 401(k) assets of retirees will more
than triple between 2000 and 2040 (in year 2000 dollars). If the equity return is
equal to the historical rate less 300 basis points, the sum of these retirement
assets will more than double.
We find that the rate of growth of the sum of Social Security wealth and
401(k) assets is surprisingly uniform across deciles of the distribution of lifetime
earnings. Assuming historical rates of equity return, we find that the sum of
these retirement assets more than doubles between 2000 and 2040 for all but
the first two deciles of the distribution of lifetime earnings. Our projections also
show little growth in the sum of Social Security and 401(k) assets for families in
the lowest decile of lifetime earnings; the projected growth for families in the
second decile is 50 percent.
We emphasize the projected growth of the sum of Social Security wealth
and 401(k) assets for each Social Security wealth decile. We find substantial
increases in each decile. Assuming historical rates of return, the sum of these
retirement assets at age 65 in 2040 ranges from a low of 228 percent to a high of
378 percent of the sum in 2000 (excluding the larger increase for the 1st decile).
If the future rate of return on equities is equal to the historical rate less 300 basis
points, the sum of Social Security wealth and 401(k) assets at age 65 in 2040
ranges from 179 percent to 258 percent of the sum in 2000, depending on the
Social Security wealth decile.

Appendix
Tables 1-2 and 1-3 present components of wealth by lifetime earnings decile and
by Social Security wealth decile. These components are calculated for all singleperson families age 63 to 67 and for all two-person families with male head age
63 to 67 in 2000. The calculations are all based on Health and Retirement Study
(HRS) data.
Lifetime earnings are calculated using the Social Security earnings records for
the years 1951 to 1991 and HRS respondent reported earnings for the years
1992 to 2000. A tobit specification is used for each year to impute earnings for
persons constrained by the Social Security earnings limit. Earnings in each year
are converted to year 2000 dollars using the Social Security average wage index
and then summed to obtain lifetime earnings. Respondents that do not have
matching Social Security earnings records are not included in tables 1-2 and 1-3.
401(k) wealth: Our estimate of 401(k) wealth is obtained from HRS respondents
and pertains to balances in plans on the respondent's current job as well as on
former jobs.6 The estimate includes assets in all 401(k)-like plans, including
assets in traditional employer-provided DC plans. Each HRS respondent is
asked if they have a pension plan and, if so, whether it is "Type A" (benefits are
usually based on a formula involving age, years of service, and salary), "Type B"
(money is accumulated in an account for you), or "both." Associated with the
latter two responses is a follow-up question asking for the plan balance.
DB wealth is the sum of pension wealth from two sources. If the respondent is
employed in 1998 then DB wealth on the current job is calculated as the present
value of expected benefits assuming that the respondent will continue to work to
the normal retirement age.7 These present value calculations (made by HRS
staff) are based on features of the pension plan obtained from the employer.
These estimates of pension wealth are only available for 1998, so the present
value in 2000 is obtained by assuming DB wealth grew 4 percent per year from
1998 and 2000. DB wealth from prior jobs is based on respondent-reported
receipt of "pension and annuity benefits" in 2000. We calculate the mortality
adjusted present value of pension income for each person in the household
reporting such income in 2000. We assume that the pension income reported in
2000 remains constant in the future. We also assume a three percent real
discount rate and we use a unisex life table. No adjustments are made for
survivor benefits or for cost of living adjustments that are common in state and
local pensions.

Social Security wealth is the present value of Social Security benefits in 1992,
assuming that the respondent continued to work until the normal retirement age.8
These estimates of Social Security wealth are only available in 1992 dollars so
we convert these values to year 2000 dollars using the CPI.
Other components of total wealth, including IRA balances and housing equity are
reported values from the 2000 wave of the HRS.
