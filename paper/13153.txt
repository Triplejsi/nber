ABSTRACT
The continuations procedure within the U.S. patent system has been criticized for enabling firms to
manipulate the patent review process for strategic purposes. Changes during the 1990s in patent procedures
affected the incentives of applicants to exploit the continuations process, and additional reforms in
continuations currently are being considered. Nonetheless, little is known about applicants' use of
the three major types of continuations -- the Continuation Application (CAP), the Continuations-In-Part
(CIP), and Divisions -- to alter the term and scope of patents. This paper analyzes patents issued from
the three types of continuations to U.S. firms during 1981 - 2004 (with priority years 1981 - 2000),
and links their frequency to the characteristics of patents, assignees and industries. We find that CIPs
are disproportionately filed by R&D-intensive, small firms that patent heavily, and are more common
in chemical and biological technologies. Patents resulting from CIP filings contain more claims and
backward citations per patent on average, and cover relatively "valuable" inventions. In contrast, CAPs
cover less valuable patents from large, capital-intensive firms that patent intensively, particularly in
computer and semiconductor patents. We also analyze the effects of the 1995 change in patent term
on continuation applications and find that the Act reduced the use of continuations overall, while shifting
the output of CAPs toward "less important" patents.

Introduction

A large literature spanning economics, law, and strategic management has considered the
strategic use by firms of intellectual property, including patents. Among the topics
covered by this literature are the causes of increased patenting (Kortum & Lerner 1999,
Hall 2005), firms’ decisions to acquire patents in fields in which company executives
state that patents do not aid in appropriating the returns to innovation (Hall & Ziedonis
2001), and the incidence and outcomes of patent litigation among firms (see Hall &
Ziedonis 2007, as well as Somaya 2003). The use by firms of patent examination
procedures has received less attention from scholars, despite widespread
acknowledgement by patent attorneys and other “IP professionals” of the importance of
such procedures in the patent strategies of firms. This paper examines the characteristics
of firms using one such procedural strategy, the patent continuation, to shed light on
motives for and effects of this strategy.
The continuation procedure allows inventors to restart the examination of their
patent application, retaining the filing date of a previous application that discloses the
same invention. Inventors can use continuations to revise their claims to reflect
technological developments affecting their invention after their initial application or to
respond to an examiner’s arguments and comments. According to the U.S. Patent Office,
the procedure, which has been a part of the U.S. patent system since 1863, is intended to
“lead to a well-designed set of claims that give the public notice of precisely what the
applicant regards as his or her invention” (Federal Register 2006 p 48).

Continuations are unique to the U.S. patent system1 and have been criticized by
economists and members of the patent bar because of their potential for strategic
manipulation, notably in so-called “submarine patents” that are issued following long
periods of examination and revision through continuation applications (Graham &
Mowery 2004). 2 Other critics claim that continuations are used by applicants to badger
examinees into granting patents of dubious quality, so-called “junk patents,” by
repeatedly filing continuations on a single application (Quillen & Webster 2001). But
patent attorneys and industry groups defend the use of continuations (see for example,
Biotechnology Industry Organization, 2006) to protect the high-risk investments of
“pioneering inventors” in “young” fields of invention that are subject to uncertainty.
Indeed, proposed changes in Japan’s patent examination system include procedures that
resemble continuations. A quasi-official Japanese patent policy research organization
argues that the introduction of continuations into Japanese patent procedures “will
promote front-runners to strategically obtain patents” (I IP Bulletin 2005, p.2-5).
Not for the first time in patent policy, however, the debate over the use, abuse,
benefits, and costs of the continuation procedure has been conducted in an evidentiary
vacuum. The limited empirical work on continuations to date (Graham 2004, Graham &

1

Continuation applications have been available to patentees in the United States since 1863. In
Godfrey v. Eames, 68 U.S. 317 (1863), the U.S. Supreme Court interpreted the Patent Act of
1836 to allow continuation applications, in that case when the original application was abandoned
on the same day that the new continued application was filed. The use of continuing applications
was also upheld by the Supreme Court in Crown Cork & Seal Co. v. Gutmann Co., 304 U.S. 159
(1938) and General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Electric Co., 304 U.S. 175 (1938).

The closest parallels in other patent systems are the Divisional available in the European and
Japanese Patent Offices, and the option allowing for the selective prosecution of claims from a
search report by the German Patent Office (Quillen & Webster 2001). Since the 18-month
publication requirement has been a part of the European Patent Convention since its inception,
the opportunity for inventors to “hide” technology advances by using Divisions has been strictly
limited.

Mowery 2004) has focused on interindustry differences in the incidence of continuations.
Little if any work has analyzed the characteristics of the patents or patentholders that
exploit the continuation procedure in the U.S. patent system. We do not know, for
example, whether continuations are more likely to be filed in relatively “young”
technological fields, or whether these applications more frequently cover “pioneering”
inventions, as the Biotechnology Industry Organization asserts. This paper analyzes the
characteristics of U.S. corporate patents that are subject to the three major types of
continuations (see below for definition and discussion of these three types) and examines
the use of all three types among publicly listed firms and technological fields during the
1981-2004 period.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the role of
continuations in the patent examination process, discussing procedural differences among
the three types of continuations: the Continuation Application; the Continuation-In-Part;
and the Division. Section 3 describes the construction of our data, compares the
characteristics of continued patents with those of patents not subject to continuations, and
analyzes variations in the use of each practice among technology classes. Section 4 deals
with the continuations propensity of U.S. corporate patentees and Section 5 analyzes the
effects of the change in patent term that became effective in 1995 (see below for further
discussion) on the incidence and characteristics of continuations. Section 6 summarizes
and discusses the implications of our findings.

Continuations: Provisions and Practice

2.1

The patent review process and continuations

5

The USPTO patent review process starts with the inventor filing an application
containing a written description of her invention. This description is formalized in legal
language by “claims” that define the invention covered by the application. The examiner
compares the claims against existing knowledge or “prior art” to determine whether or
not the application meets the standards of patentability. This “patent prosecution”
process may result in the application being accepted or rejected in its entirety or (more
likely) the rejection of one or more claims by the examiner. The applicant can respond to
a rejection of claims by disclosing additional information showing that her claims are
valid, or by narrowing them to accommodate prior art and/or the examiner’s suggestions.
The examiner reviews this response and may allow the patent claim, suggest
modifications, or issue a “final rejection” of the application.3 This entire process can go
through several rounds, each of which lasts 2-3 years on average, and has been
characterized as a “give-and-take-affair” between the applicant and the examiner (Merges
1997).4
2.2

Types of Continuations

3

A determined applicant faced with a “final rejection” can pursue several options, including a
Request for Continued Examination (RCE), which may or may not contain amendments to the
original application, so long as it discloses the same invention. This application is treated like a
new application, giving the applicant another chance for her claims to be allowed, amended, or
even reviewed by a different examiner, while preserving the “priority date” of the original patent
application (Lemley & Moore 2004). In the U.S. system, however, the
continuation/divisional/CIP routinely is assigned to the examiner who handled the parent case.
Exceptions occur if the examiner has retired from the USPTO or has been promoted to a position
that does not include examining patent applications. Another exception occurs if the Office of
Initial Patent Examination had classified the child application into a very different patent
classification than the parent application. In that case it would go to a different art unit and thus
to a different examiner. Applicants do not have a say in deciding who prosecutes their application
(Personal communication with Carl Oppedahl, patent lawyer, January 21, 2006).
4
The applicant also can seek an interview with the examiner, where she tries to persuade the
examiner of the patentability of her claims, or appeal the rejection to the Board of Patent Appeals
and Interferences and if unsuccessful there, to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia
or to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
6

Continuations permit an applicant to refile a pending patent application,5 with or
without substantial modifications, by renewing at least some portion of the original
application. There are three types of “continuations”: the “Continuation Application”
(abbreviated hereafter as the CAP), the “Continuation-In-Part (CIP),” and the
“Division.”6 The Continuation Application discloses the identical invention claimed in
the prior “parent” non-provisional application before the parent application was patented
or abandoned. The disclosure presented in the CAP must be the same as that of the
original application; i.e., the continuation should not include anything that would
constitute new matter if inserted in the original application.7 The CIP includes a
substantial portion or all of the parent application and adds matter not disclosed in that
application, although the benefit of early priority is awarded only for the original
disclosures contained in the new application. A Division or divisional application occurs
when the original application contains more than one independent invention. In such a
case, the USPTO allows the applicant to “elect” one of the disclosed inventions for
continued examination. The other inventions disclosed in the parent application can be
withdrawn and pursued in new applications called Divisions. A new application can be
filed as a divisional application and benefit from the early filing date of the parent
application only if it discloses and claims subject matter disclosed in the “original” or
“parent” application.

35 USC § 120 (1991). Benefit of earlier filing date in the United States.
The continuation and continuation-in-part are authorized under 35 USC § 120 “Benefit of earlier
filing date in the United States.” Divisions are authorized under 35 USC § 121 “Divisional
applications.”

The fee required to request a continuing application is no higher than that for filing a first
application—$710 in 2001, and $355 for small entities. 37 C.F.R. 17(e).

All three types of continuations introduce a delay in the prosecution and final
issue decision for a U.S. patent application and permit the applicant to adopt the date of
the application that is still pending within the Patent Office.8,9 So long as the original
“parent” application and the follow-up continuation application disclose the same
invention, the applicant can preserve the parent application’s filing date. Because an
application may be continued any number of times, and because there is no limit to the
number of times that a parent application may be abandoned, continuations can be used
to prevent the patent examiner from reaching a decision on a patent application. Strings
of continuations may thus develop, with issue decisions being postponed for decades.10
Prior to 1999, all U.S. patent applications remained secret until the issue of the patent,
enabling applicants to maintain the secrecy of their application throughout this extended
period.
Revisions in U.S. patent law that became effective in 1995 changed the term of
patent protection from 17 years from the date of patent issue to 20 years from the
application date. This change sought (among other things) to reduce the incentives for
inventors to pursue “submarine” patents. An inventor seeking a “submarine” patent

8

In case of the CIP, only those claims that are carried over from the original application receive
the benefit of the priority date.
9
The application must meet certain conditions. Under 35 USC § 120, a patent application is
entitled to adopt the filing date of a “parent” application when (1) both applications disclose the
same invention; (2) both applications are filed by the same inventor; (3) both applications are
simultaneously co-pending; (4) the earlier application meets the disclosure requirements of 35
USC § 112; and (5) the later application contains a specific reference to the earlier application.
Sampson v. Ampex Corp. (1971, DC NY), 333 F. Supp. 59, aff’d. (2nd Cir. NY) 463 F2d 1042.
The language of 35 USC § 120 was initially adopted in the Patent Act of 1952, and legislative
history suggests that the section was intended to write existing legal practice on the issue into the
statute. In re. Henriksen, 55 C.C.P.A. 1384 (1968).
10
See, for instance, Jerome Lemelson’s U.S. patent 5,283,641, Apparatus and methods for
automated analysis, issued February 1, 1994. The priority date of this patent was December 24,
1954, and there were no fewer than eleven continuations in this patent’s chain while it languished
in the patent office for 39 years.
8

submitted an application, thereby establishing a priority date for her invention, and filed
numerous continuations on the initial application, which remained secret throughout the
period of USPTO review of repeated revisions (continuations) in the original application.
Even after the 1995 changes in patent term, continuations offered some strategic benefits
to an applicant by allowing an extended period of secrecy prior to the issue of a patent,
but this benefit was reduced by 1999 legislation mandating the publication of most patent
applications 18 months after their submission.11 The “publication” requirement,
however, has not removed all of the benefits of continuations. Applicants can still make
changes to individual claims reported in the published disclosure, and thus can use the
continuation procedure to extend the period of secrecy during review by at least 18
months for these individual claims (Glazier, 1997).12
The effects of these changes in U.S. IPR policy on continuations are unclear, for
several reasons. The 1995 change in patent term forced patentees using the continuations
procedure to forego some portion of the patent term in exchange for a longer period of
pendency. But this tradeoff may be of far less significance in technologies for which
product life cycles are short (e.g., software) than in sectors exhibiting longer product life
cycles, such as drugs and chemicals. Moreover, the 1999 Act allows applicants to “opt
out” of the 18-month publication requirement for patents filed solely in the United States,
11

The US patent law now requires the publication of all applications after 18 months, but
applicants are granted automatic exemptions from this requirement by filing a statement that they
have no intention of filing the application in a foreign jurisdiction that requires an 18-month
publication of its patent applications.
12
For example, an applicant may use the continuation procedure to make subtle changes in one or
more claims consistent with the original disclosure, but not identical to the original published
claims. The continuation may thus delay issue of the patent while the applicant observes the uses
to which the technology is put in the marketplace, and alters the claim accordingly. Thus, when
the patent ultimately is allowed to issue, the technology disclosed in the patent may be of no
surprise to competitors, but the precise boundaries of the claims may be a surprise, thus allowing
the patentee to demand royalties from competitors infringing on the altered claim.
9

meaning that some “submarine incentives” may remain for applicants who do not file
applications outside of the United States. The U.S. remains a huge market, and the
ability of applicants to recapture their foreign-filing rights has yet to be tested in the U.S.
courts. The effects of the publication requirement on post-1999 applicants’ use of
continuations therefore may be limited. Indeed, as late as 2005, well after the 1995 and
1999 reforms, continuation filings accounted for 30% of all applications received by the
PTO (Federal Register 2006).13
Despite extensive debate over the benefits, costs, uses, and abuses of
continuations, there exists little if any analysis of the characteristics of patents subject to
continuations and the characteristics of the assignees of continued patents. Nor has the
overall importance of continuations before 1995 in U.S. patenting or the effects of the
1995 statutory changes on the incidence and characteristics of continuations been
examined. We address the following questions in our analysis of continuation
applications:
1. How do important characteristics (number of claims, forward and backward
citations, payment of patent-renewal fees) of issued patents subject to continuations
and/or continuations of different types compare with those of corporate patents overall?
2. Are continuations concentrated in “emerging” fields of inventive activity,
which may be subject to greater uncertainty concerning claims or feasibility? To what
13

During 2005, the PTO received approximately 317,000 nonprovisional applications, of which
about 63,000 were continuing applications and about 52,000 were requests for continued
examination. Thus, about thirty percent (63,000 + 52,000)/(317,000 + 52,000) of the Office’s
patent examining resources must be applied to examining continued examination filings that
require reworking earlier applications instead of examining new applications (Federal Register
2006, p 50). Recent proposals for patent reform (dated 2006) seek to curtail the practice by
limiting applicants to two continuations per application.
10

extent are assignees using the practice to patent inventions in fields in which they have
not previously been active (and therefore may be more likely to revise their applications),
i.e., fields in which they might be described as recent entrants or as “pioneers?”
3. What are the characteristics (e.g., patenting intensity, capital intensity, size) of
corporate assignees of continued patents, and have these characteristics changed since the
1995 changes in patent term? Do the characteristics of assignees differ among
continuation types?

3.

The data

Our empirical analysis utilizes U.S. utility patents granted between 1981 and 2004 from
the NBER patent database (Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg 2001), and the United States
Patent and Trademark Office. We gathered the continuations history of each patent from
the “Related Patent Data” on the wrapper of patent documents, which reports the type of
continuation applied for and their application dates. From the latter, we calculated the
“priority date” as the date on which the first in a series of continuation applications was
filed in office. For patents that were never subject to the continuations procedure
(referred to below as “ordinary” patents), the first and only application date is the priority
date. Next, we separated patents that were subject to only one type of continuation (the
CAP, CIP, or Division) from those that resulted from multiple continuation types
(referred to below as “Combination” continuations).
The USPTO assigns patents to one of nearly 500 technology classes. We used the
NBER classification developed by Hall et al. (2001) to aggregate the 500 classes into 36
two-digit technological subcategories for use in our regression analyses, and further

11

combined these 36 subcategories into 6 main categories: Chemical; Computers and
Communications; Drugs and Medical; Electrical and Electronics; Mechanical; and Others
(the subcategories that are aggregated to the main categories are apparent from Table 4).
3.1

The frequency of continuations
Since we are primarily interested in the continuations behavior of U.S. firms, we

exclude other assignees (foreign, government, individual and unassigned applicants) in
our patent dataset. Patents assigned to U.S. corporations are more likely to have
undergone a continuations procedure than those in any other assignee category (see
Graham 2004 for a comparison of the continuations propensities of different assignee
classes). Indeed, U.S.-owned corporations and small businesses are assigned 44% of all
patents in our dataset, but 55% of the patents with a history of at least one continuation
application.14 Table 1 summarizes the use of the three different types of continuations
(the share of each type as a share of all corporate-assigned continued patents) by year of
issue during 1981 – 2004 for the 1,122,935 patents that were assigned to U.S.
corporations.

Table 1 here

Continuation applications take longer on average to issue than applications that
are not continued. Patents that were not subject to continuations are granted 2.2 years
from the date of first application (standard deviation of 1.1), but applications subject to
the procedure pend for 4.4 years (s.d. of 2.3) on average. The longer pendency for
14

This category is identified by assignee code number 2 in the USPTO patent records. Over 96%
of patents in this category are assigned to corporations (Hall, et al. 2001). Note that some
universities patent under university-owned foundation and corporations.
12

continued patents introduces a truncation bias that makes it problematic to infer trends in
continuation applications from patents issued during the later years of our study.15 We
deal with this truncation problem by using the priority year or date of first application for
the patents in our dataset, and limit our analysis to the 966,020 patents applied for during
1981 – 2000 and issued during 1981 – 2004.16

Figure 1 here

Figure 1 depicts trends in continuation types by priority year. Continuation
applications were common between 1981 and 2000 -- 29% of all corporate-assigned
patents applied for during the period included at least one continuation in their review.
The practice peaked in the half-decade preceding 1995, with nearly 40% of applications
during the period issued via continuations. For the entire 1981 – 2000 period, CAPs were
the most common type of continuations, accounting for 30% of all patents within these
data that had been through the continuations procedure at least once. The shares of CIP’s
and Divisions are slightly smaller, at 28% and 22% respectively. Within our U.S.-firm
sample, 20% of all continuation patents are “Combinations,” i.e. including more than one
type of continuation in their prosecution history.
15

In other words, ceteris paribus, a patent that was applied for in 2003 and was not subject to a
continuations procedure is more likely to show up among patents issued in or before 2006 as
compared to a patent that was first applied for in the same year, but was subject to continuations
after.
16
63% of continuation patents (but 96% of “ordinary” patents) issue with a pendency period of 4
years or less and 94% of continuation patents issue with a pendency period of 8 years or less.
Nearly 37% of the continuation patents with a priority date of 2000 have not issued by 2004, and
6% of continuation patents with a 1996 priority date have not issued by that year. Figure A1 in
the Appendix plots the distribution of “pendency,” lags between priority and issue years, for
continuation and ordinary patents. Table A1 disaggregates mean pendency lags by continuation
type.
13

3.2

Characteristics of continued patents
We next compare the characteristics of patents resulting from the three types of

continuations with each other and with ordinary patents. The characteristics are: the
number of claims, the number of backward and forward citations, and the payment by the
patentholder of patent renewal fees four years after issue. We briefly describe each of
these variables before presenting our findings.
(i) Claims: The claims in a patent define in formal language the novel technical
features of the invention, and delineate the breadth of its “scope” or the technological
space being protected. Controlling for technology class, the number of claims in a patent
is correlated with its economic value (Lanjouw & Schankerman 2004). Lanjouw &
Schankerman (2001) also found that litigated patents had a significantly higher average
number of claims than did a control group of non-litigated patents. For this study, we use
the number of claims for patents granted between 1981 and 1997.
(ii) Backward citations: Inventors are required to be assiduous in their
identification of relevant prior art in their applications. The patent examiner further
verifies that all appropriate previous patents have been cited. These “backward
citations,” along with claims, delineate novelty in the applicant’s invention and the rights
granted in the patent. Backward citations reveal various aspects of the technological
lineage of inventions. A patent with a large number of backward citations to patents
assigned to other entities indicates that the inventor is operating in a crowded
technological area with a number of “nearby” patents and competitors. 17 Patents that
include a large share of “self citations,” i.e. citations to an assignee’s own patents in these
backward citations, are more heavily based upon the inventor’s own prior inventive work,
17

Citing a number of backward references also makes a patent harder to challenge in court.
14

rather than those of competitors, and may not indicate a crowded inventive landscape.
Patents with a large number of backward citations that are dispersed across different
patent classes arguably span a broader spectrum of prior art, and scholars characterize
patents with more broadly dispersed backward citations as representing more “original”
inventions than patents that draw mainly on prior art within the same class (Jaffe &
Trajtenberg 2002).
We obtained the number of prior patents cited by each patent in our study, the
percentage of these references that were self-citations, and the technology classes of the
cited patents. From the latter, we calculated a Herfindahl index of backward reference
concentration which is 0 when all backward citations are to patents from a single class
(low “originality”) and 1 for the case of perfect dispersion.
Beginning with patents applied for in 2001, the USPTO distinguished between
applicant- and examiner- inserted citations in patents on the wrapper of the issued patent.
Data on post-2001 patents reveal that the PTO is responsible for as much as 40% of all
prior patent references in an “average” patent, potentially reflecting the different
incentives of applicants and examiners in representing “prior art.” Indeed, if applicants
use the continuations procedure to strengthen their applications (either by redefining
claims in CAPs or by inserting new ones in CIPs), then the resulting patent should
contain a higher proportion of citations inserted by applicants than is true for a noncontinuation patent.
(iii) Forward citations: Citations to a patent made in subsequent patents indicate
that the invention or information in the cited patent contributed to the development of
later inventions. Forward citations are commonly used in empirical analysis as indicators

15

of the technological importance of patents. Since citations arrive after a patent has been
granted, they can arrive at any point of time in the patent’s life, and it is likely that older
patents will accumulate more citations. This truncation problem means that patents
granted in more recent years will appear to be less technologically important, on average.
Restricting forward citations to those appearing in patents issuing within four years after
the issue of the cited patent addresses this problem, while allowing us to examine forward
citations for patents granted as late as 2002.
(iv) Patent Renewals: Patent renewal fees were introduced in the United States in
1982 for patents applied for after that year. Patentholders are required to pay renewal fees
to maintain their patents at 4, 8, and 12 years after the grant date. Patent renewals are
used as indicators of the private value of patents, based on the premise that owners are
willing to renew their patents only when the expected value of the patents exceeds the
cost of maintaining them (Lanjouw et al. 1998). We collected patent expiration data
through 2005 that covers the renewal decisions of patentees four years after the issue of
the patent for all patents between 1981 and 2001.
3.2.1

Descriptive statistics on continuations and patent characteristics
Table 2 displays differences in the mean number of claims, backward citations,

the share of backward references that are self-cites, the technology-class dispersion of
backward citations (“originality”), forward citations, and 4-year nonrenewal rates for
patents subject to continuations. In all of these cases, patents assigned to U.S.
corporations that did not undergo continuations (“ordinary” patents) are the reference
group.

16

Table 2 here

The first two columns compare “ordinary” patents with patents that were subject
to continuation applications. The next four columns distinguish among different types of
continuation patents. Patents issuing from continuations contain higher numbers of
backward citations, on average, and these backward citations are drawn from a broader
set of technology classes, suggesting that continued patents may indeed be more
“original” (all of the above differences are by comparison with “ordinary” patents, and
are significant at p<0.001).18 Patents issued during 2001- 2004 to corporate assignees
that resulted from continuations also have smaller shares of examiner-inserted citations to
prior art (20%) than do continued patents (55%). Table A2.1 in the Appendix tabulates
the median number of all backward citations for 291,482 U.S. corporate utility patents
issued between 2001 and the median percentage of citations originating from
examiners.19
Patents resulting from CIPs contain significantly more backward self-citations
(relative to ordinary and CAP patents), suggesting that they are used in patents that
disproportionately build upon the assignees’ prior work. CIPs produce patents with 26%
more claims than “ordinary” patents, reflecting their use by applicants to bring in
additional material in the form of new claims. CIPs also receive the highest number of
forward citations within four years of their issue (a mean of 2.7 citations per patent, as
18

The originality measure tends to be highly directly correlated with the number of backward
references. Our “originality” result holds, even on controlling for the number of backward
citations.
19
While examiners insert more citations on average in certain technologies (accounting for 46%
of all backward citations for all patents in Computers and Communications, but only 19.5% in
Drugs and Medicine) our result regarding differences between continuation and ordinary patents
is robust to technology-specific differences.
17

compared to 2.3 citations/patent in the control sample, p<0.001) , and are less likely to
expire after 4 years of issue as compared to “ordinary” patents. These results suggest that
patents emerging from the CIP are of higher private and technological “value.”
The average CAP patent has a significantly larger average number of backward
citations and claims, but does not differ significantly from the mean “ordinary” patent in
its proportion of backward self-cites. Divisional patents have significantly fewer forward
citations, fewer claims, and lower renewal rates by comparison with the reference group
patents. This result may reflect a tendency for Divisions to be carved out of parent
applications (mostly in response to an examiner’s restriction requirement), and claims in
Divisions may not have been considered sufficiently important by the applicant to
warrant a separate application in the first place.
The remainder of our discussion focuses on CAPs and CIPs (these are the two
most frequently used types of continuation applications and are the focus of recent
proposals for continuations reforms), rather than on Divisions and Combinations. We
exclude Divisions and Combinations from our analysis because Divisions are filed at the
behest of the PTO (in response to “restriction requirements”) and are less likely to be
used strategically by applicants. “Combination” continuations are difficult to interpret,
since by definition this heterogeneous class of continuations could involve multiple
motives.
3.3

Technological differences
The economic value and importance of patents vary considerably among

technologies, and these differences are widely asserted to influence the patenting
strategies of firms (Cohen, Nelson & Walsh 2001; Levin, Nelson, Klevorick, & Winter

18

1987). Pharmaceutical and chemicals-related patents are typically rated by industry
executives as indispensable for capturing the returns to innovations, but patents in
semiconductors and electronics are rated as far less important for manufacturers (Hall &
Ziedonis 2001). Since continuations are an important element of firms’ patent strategies,
the next few paragraphs examine differences in the intensity, trends, and characteristics
of continued patents across technological sectors.
Table 3 lists the share of “ordinary” patents and of the four different types of
continuations for each of the 36-class and the 6-category technology groupings.

Table 3 here

Patents in the “Drugs and Medicine” and the “Chemicals” technology classes are among
the most intensive users of continuations. Continuations overall accounted for 46% of
the patents issued in “Drugs and Medicine” for priority years 1981-2000, and 36% of
those issued in “Chemicals” during the same period. CIPs (30% of patents issuing from
continuations) and Combinations (30% for Drugs and Medicine and 22% in Chemicals)
account for the majority of continuations in these two technology classes. The intensive
use of CIPs in these classes contrasts with the Computers and Communications sector,
where CAPs account for 50% of all continuations. Semiconductor patents differ from
other technology classes in their high Divisional propensity (40% of all continuations in
this technology are divisions). This considerable variation among technological fields in
the use of different continuation types and trends nevertheless does not preclude

19

significant interfirm differences in the use of continuations, the focus of the following
section.

4.

Continuations and corporate-assignee characteristics

Continuation applications produce patents that differ from “ordinary” patents, and the
nature of these differences depends on the type of continuation. In this section, we
combine our findings regarding differences in the characteristics of continued patents
with an analysis of the influence of observable elements of firm structure and their patent
portfolios on continuations activity, by utilizing Compustat data on publicly traded U.S.owned corporations.
4.1

Data on assignee characteristics
A challenge in linking patent-level information with Compustat’s variables is the

fact that firms patent under various names, and assignee names may not accurately reflect
the ownership of patents. We used the NBER PTO-Compustat correspondence file to
assemble a set of unique patenting entities by identifying firm acquisitions, mergers,
name changes, and majority-owned subsidiaries between 1981 and 2000.20 This yielded
matches for 2,263 patent assignees to 1,273 unique Compustat firms that collectively
owned 363,308 patents, representing 38% of all patents assigned to U.S.-owned
businesses between 1981 and 2000. Since firms enter and exit the data during the period
of observation, with some instances of multiple entry and exit, our sample is an
unbalanced panel.
20

Note that the NBER file is not current and reflects the ownership status captured in 1989. The
file was constructed by assembling U.S. patents assigned to unique firms by identifying name
changes, subsidiaries, and merger and acquisition information from a variety of sources
(Lexis/Nexis business directories, 10-K filings, and the Directory of Corporate Affiliations).
20

The continuations behavior of publicly traded large firms represented in
Compustat (and hence our analysis) differs from that of privately held firms. For
instance, our “in-sample” patents assigned to public companies were more likely to have
issued from CAPs and Divisions, but less likely to have used CIPs and combinations of
continuations than the “out of sample” patents assigned to non-publicly listed U.S. owned
entities. These differences are statistically significant, i.e. we can reject the null
hypothesis of equality of sample means (based on a t-test that assumed unequal
variances) at conservatively defined significance levels.21 The results of our Compustat
analysis accordingly may not be representative of the broader corporate patent assignee
population’s continuations behavior.
4.2 Variables
What observable attributes of firms affect their continuations behavior? Lacking
direct evidence on corporate motives, we test the influence on corporate assignees’
continuations behavior of firm-level variables such as R&D intensity, capital intensity
and patent intensity.
Continuations raise the legal and patent-prosecution expenses of patent applicants,
and therefore should be more common among firms for which patents are relatively
important as a means of appropriating the returns to innovation or for strategic purposes.
The patenting intensity of firms therefore should be positively related to their propensity
to pursue continuations. We measure the patent intensity (PATINT) of a firm as the ratio
of its patent applications that issue to R&D expenditures for each year in our sample and
hypothesize that more patent-intensive firms are likely to rely on continuations.
21

Table A4 of the Appendix compares the frequency of continuation types of our in-sample
patenting entities and those omitted because of the lack of Compustat data.
21

How does patent intensity affect choice among continuations? Predicting
continuations choice as a function of patent intensity requires a more precise
characterization of motives than our data currently support. Nonetheless, we consider
(and test) two broad views of the motives for continuations use by corporate assignees.
One interpretation of continuations (as represented by the Biotechnology Industry
Organization 2006, for example) portrays them as associated with the innovative
activities of firms that specialize in R&D, relying on strong patent rights to trade their
technologies (Arora 1995, Merges 1998). According to Arora et al. (2001), these
specialist firms (“technology traders”) include design firms in semiconductors (a group
emphasized in Hall and Ziedonis, 2001), specialized chemical or biomedical R&D firms,
or suppliers of intermediate technological inputs (common in aerospace and instruments).
We define technology traders or specialists as firms for which patents are important and
R&D investment is high. If technology specialists favor a particular type of continuation,
ceteris paribus, we should observe a positive coefficient for the interaction of patentintensity and R&D-intensity (RDINT, defined as R&D expenditures normalized by
employment)22 in predicting the choice of that continuation type.
We further test whether the “pioneering” inventions of technology specialists are
more likely to issue from continuations by including an interaction term that captures the
multiplicative effect of patent importance (proxied by the forward citations received by a
firm’s patents within four years of issue), R&D-intensity, and patent-intensity. A finding
that continuations use is positively correlated with the combined effect of R&D intensity,

22

Alternative estimations that normalized capital-intensity and R&D intensity by sales rather
than employment did not change our results.
22

patenting intensity, and the quality of firms’ patents supports the “pioneering inventor”
characterization of continuations users.
A second characterization of the motives for continuations associates their use
with the “defensive” patent strategies of firms in industries in which patents have been
characterized as less important mechanisms for appropriating the returns to R&D (Hall &
Ziedonis 2001 in semiconductors, Bessen & Hunt 2004 in software).23 One “defensive”
patenting strategy relies on the accumulation of large patent portfolios for exchange with
other firms through cross-licensing as a means of avoiding costly litigation and
potentially, the shutdown of manufacturing capacity. According to Hall and Ziedonis
(2001), the patenting behavior of U.S. semiconductor firms since the mid-1980s is
consistent with this interpretation. Firms with large investments in manufacturing
facilities are more likely to adopt a defensive patenting strategy, in this view, as a means
of avoiding “holdup” through litigation. We test the importance and influence on
continuations choice of this form of defensive patenting by including a variable that
interacts sunk costs and patent intensity. Sunk costs are proxied by firms’ capital
intensity (CAPINT), i.e. capital investments (measured as the book value of a firm’s
property, plant, and equipment) normalized by employment. With suitable controls, we
can interpret a positive coefficient on this interaction term as supporting a prediction that
continuations are used by defensive patenters.
Since these “defensive patenters” are more concerned with the quantity rather
than the quality of their patent portfolio, this form of defensive patenting should be
associated with lower average patent quality. We therefore include another multiplicative
23

The Quillen & Webster (2001) assertion that continuations are used by certain applicants to
acquire a large number of “junk patents” is consistent with this less benign view of continuations.
23

interaction of patent importance, capital-intensity and patent-intensity. A negative
coefficient for this interaction variable is consistent with the use of continuations by
defensive patenters to acquire patents of lower average value (see Gallini 2002 or Shapiro
2001). A positive coefficient suggests that continuations are used in the more important
inventions of these firms. Table 4 summarizes the interpretation of our key interaction
variables and the implications of their coefficient signs for our competing interpretations
of the motives for continuations.

Table 4 here

Our earlier discussion of the characteristics of patents issuing from the different
types of continuations suggests that CAPs will be associated with “defensive patenting”
strategies. That is, we expect the interaction of capital-intensity and patent-intensity to
have a positive and significant coefficient, and the interaction of this variable with patent
value should have a negative coefficient in explaining the probability of CAP filings.
The data presented earlier on the characteristics of patents issued from CIPs, however,
lead us to expect their use to be correlated with characteristics of “pioneering inventions”
(high-value patents) and use by “technology traders” (high levels of R&D- and patentintensity).24

24

The characteristics of “submarine” patenters are more difficult to statistically pinpoint, although
anecdotes suggest that firms following submarine strategies are more likely to be small and use
all three types of continuations. Jerome Lemelson’s famous “submarine” U.S. patent 5,283,641
covering “Apparatus and methods for automated analysis” used all three types of continuations.
We therefore make no predictions about corporate characteristics and continuations use by
“submarine” patenters.
24

Our analysis of corporate characteristics and continuations behavior includes two
other variables that capture differences in the position of individual patents within firms’
patent portfolios. We measure the “centrality” of a patent to a firm’s portfolio by
computing the share of the patent’s technology class in the “flow” of patents issuing to a
firm each year. The value of TECHSHARE is bounded above at one, e.g., when a firm’s
patents are all assigned to the same technology class within our 36-category taxonomy.
TECHSHARE controls for the differential use of continuations by firms in patents that are
more (or less) common in firms’ current portfolios. We also capture a time dimension of
firms’ technological focus by computing the difference in years between the year of a
given patent’s application year and the year in our dataset in which the firm was first
assigned a patent in the same class. Hence, TECHTIME measures the patenting
experience of firms in different technology areas, which may be imperfectly correlated
with the age of firms.
We control for other attributes that may influence continuations behavior. Firm
size is measured as the log of employment (EMP) and can affect continuations behavior
because of economies of scale and fixed costs associated with patent activity (e.g., the
cost of maintaining an in-house staff of patent attorneys). Industry-, technology- and
time-specific dummies control for unobserved variation in technological opportunity and
other factors (e.g. changes in patent law, technological, and economic trends) that affect
applicants’ decisions to file continuations. The age of firms (AGE) is also included to
distinguish effects due to experience and learning that are not captured by firm size.
In summary, we are testing the influence of the following explanatory variables
on the continuations choice of a patent:

25

(i) the patenting intensity of firms, calculated as annual log number of patents/ M$
of annual R&D
(ii) the capital intensity of firms (log book value of plant, property and equipment
in M$/1000 employees)
(iii) the R&D intensity of firms (log annual R&D expenditure in M$/1000
employees)
(iv) the quality of the invention, measured by forward citations received within 4
years of its issue.
(v) multiplicative interaction of (i) & (ii).
(vi) multiplicative interaction of (i) & (iii).
(vii) multiplicative interaction of (i), (ii) & (iv).
(viii) multiplicative interaction of (i), (iii) & (v).
Our control variables include:
(i) the technological relevance of a firm’s application to its current focus captured
by the share of its technology class in the firm’s patent portfolio.
(ii) the patenting experience of a firm in a particular technological area, calculated
as the difference between a patent’s application year and the year of the firm’s first
application in that class.
(iii) the size of firms measured by log employment.
(iv) log of firm age.
(v) industry-specific dummies (13 categories, based on 2-digit SIC class).
(vi) technology-specific dummies (26 categories, based on NBER technology
classification).

26

(vii) application-year dummies.
Table 5 summarizes descriptive statistics for the variables in our analysis. The
median Compustat firm in our sample has about 4,000 employees, spends $14.5 million
annually on R&D, has capital assets totaling $ 250 million, and successfully applies for 6
patents a year.

4.3

Model specification and results
We analyze the choice of continuation (j = {0, 1,2,3,4} representing choices of

“no continuation”, CAP, CIP, Divisional or a “combination”) as being determined by a
mix of invention- and firm-level attributes (‘x’ represents the vector of these factors).
The conditional probability ‘y’ of each continuation type can be estimated by specifying
a multinomial logit (MNL) choice model. Note that since the probabilities sum to unity,
P(y = 0 | x) is determined once we know the probabilities for j = 1,…, 4. The conditional
response probability for continuation type ‘j’ is given by (Wooldridge 2004):

P ( y = j | x) =

exp(xβ j )
4
⎤
⎡
1
+
⎢ ∑ exp(xβ h )⎥
⎦
⎣ h =1

, j = 1,.......,4

The effect of each ‘x’ on P(y = j), that is, the conditional probability of the type of
continuation ‘j’, is given by the corresponding β j . The estimations are carried out by
maximum likelihood methods and results are reported in Table 6.

27

Table 6 here

The absolute values of the estimates are not particularly meaningful, and we
accordingly focus on the relative size, signs, and statistical significance of coefficients for
the independent variables in Table 6. All coefficients convey ceteris paribus effects and
should be interpreted as reflecting the effects of the relevant independent variable relative
to patents that did not undergo any continuation (j=0). Since this is a nonlinear model,
the effect of any independent variable depends on the values at which the other
independent variables are held constant. Table A5 in the Appendix reports changes in
choice probabilities when a particular ‘x’ changes from ½ of one standard deviation
below its mean to ½ of one standard deviation above, with the values of all other
independent variables held at their means (we also report changes in probability when the
‘x’ of interest changes from its minimum value in our sample to its maximum).25
The interaction terms significantly influence the choice among continuation types
in ways that are broadly consistent with our priors. Firms that perform R&D and patent
intensively --- traits that are characteristic of technology specialists --- are the most likely
to use CIPs, but this interaction term is negatively associated with CAPs and Divisions.
As expected, the interaction of capital-intensity and patent-intensity (defining defensive
patenters) positively affects the probability that CAPs (and Divisions) are used, but is
negatively related to CIP filings. The “value” of a patent affects continuation choice, as

25

It is also important to note that computing the exact interaction effects require taking the crossderivative of the expected value of ‘y’ with respect to the interacted variables. These issues mean
that interpreting interaction terms is not a straightforward exercise here, and that the interaction
effect may even have different signs for different values of covariates.
28

CIPs are associated with high-value patents and CAPs associated with patents that
receive a below-average number of forward citations. This effect is mediated by the
capital- and patent-intensity of firms. A combined increase in the levels of the two
variables (associated with defensive patenters and captured by the triple interaction of
FCITES, lnCAPINT and lnPATINT on CAP probability) reduces the quality of associated
CAP patents even further.
The uniformly negative sign on TECHTIME means that for all types of
continuations, the longer the time elapsed between the application and a firm’s first
patent in the same technological area, the less likely it is to be continued. In other words,
the more recently a firm has become active in patenting within a given technology class,
the more likely that it uses any of the four types of continuations (at 99% confidence
levels). Patents in areas central to a firm’s annual flow of patents (TECHSHARE) also
are associated with a higher likelihood of using any of the available continuations
procedures. The size of firms (employment) is inversely related to CIP filings, but
positively correlated with the probability of CAPs and Divisions. These results are
broadly consistent with the view that CIPs are more likely to be used by small,
technology specialist firms, while CAPs are used by large corporate patentees in
defensive strategies.
In regressions that are not reported here, we estimated the continuation choice
probabilities for patents in each of the five major technology classes (we omitted
“Others” because of the vast heterogeneity in this class). The effects of explanatory
variables were comparable to the combined technologies fixed-effects model, with the
following noteworthy differences. The interaction of sunk costs and patenting intensity

29

had a greater positive influence on CAP probabilities in Computers and Communication,
Electrical and Electronics, but was negligible for Chemicals, Drugs and Medicine patents.
The computers and electronic sectors also provided considerable support for the
“defensive patenting” characterization of CAP use.

5.

The effects of the 1995 change in patent term on

continuations behavior
As we noted earlier, legislation passed in December 1994 changed the term for patents
issuing after June 1995 to twenty years from application date, from the former term of 17
years from issue date. Here, we probe the effects of the law on the practice of
continuations by asking three questions: (a) did the law reduce the use by corporate
assignees of continuations?; (b) given that one motive for the 1995 change was curbing
the “strategic” use of continuations, did the “quality” or “value” of the average patent
resulting from continuations change after 1995?; and (c) how if at all did the 1995 change
in patent term affect the characteristics of the corporate assignees using continuations?
The time trends depicted in Figure 1 are similar for all four classes of
continuations -- the use of all continuation types grew through 1994 and decreased
thereafter.26 We find that the frequency of CAPs increased for patents in all major
technology categories with a priority date between 1988 and 1993 (See Figures A2.1-2.3
in the Appendix for charts depicting the use of different continuation types in each of our

26

The truncation problem (see Footnote number 17) does impact calculations regarding the exact
magnitude of decline post-1995. However, since we know from the distribution of pendency lags
that priority year 1996 under-represents continuations by 6%, PY1997 by 10% and so on, we are
confident that the post-1995 drop persists even after accounting for truncation.
30

five major technology classes), followed by a sharp decline after 1994. This pattern is
especially pronounced for patents in the Computers and Communications industry -nearly 25% of all patents first applied for in 1993 in this technology class were subject to
CAPs, a share that drops to 9% in 1996. The share of CIPs and that of Divisions for all
main technology categories, however, are more stable during the period.27
Other changes in patent application procedures after 1995 make it difficult to
conclude that the 1995 change in patent term is the sole cause of the observed decline in
CAPs. Conversations with patent attorneys revealed that the patent term change in 1995
was accompanied by the introduction of a new procedure called the “Continued
Prosecution Application” (this CPA was superseded for utility patents by the Request for
Continued Examination or RCE in 2003) that allowed applicants to keep the prosecution
of an application alive even after “final rejection” by the examiner. Before 1995, an
applicant facing a “final rejection” from the Patent Office was required to abandon the
application before filing what was called a “File Wrapper Continuation” (FWC) for
continued prosecution. The USPTO treated the FWC identically to the Continuation
Application (CAP) and as a consequence, our pre-1995 CAP patents may include those
issuing from FWCs, a group that after 1995 is excluded by virtue of being included in the
CPAs. Without controlling for the FWC/CPA/RCE conflation, it is difficult to ascribe
the decline in CAPs entirely to the change in patent term. Nonetheless, comparing the
average “importance” of patents issuing from continuations, and their corporate owners
before and after 1995 can yield valuable insights on the changed use/abuse of the

formally. The results are in Table A6 of the Appendix.

practice, and provide a benchmark for current “continuations reform” proposals (Federal
Register 2006).
5.1

Changes in corporate characteristics for post-1995 users of

continuations

We use our Compustat sample and the continuations choice model described in
Section 4.1 to investigate changes in the attributes of corporate users of continuations
after 1995. To estimate the effects of the policy change, we divide our Compustat sample
into a pre-1995 panel that excludes patents with priority year 1995 and a post-1995 panel,
and compare differences in the coefficients of independent variables across the two sets
of estimates.28 Table 7 presents the results.

Table 7 here
The coefficients on FCITES show that patents issuing from CAPs are cited less
frequently than “ordinary” patents after 1995, in contrast to pre-1995 CAP patents, which
are not statistically different from ordinary patents.29 This decline in the importance of
post-1995 CAPs is not affected by the FWC/CPA/RCE problem described earlier.
Applicants that might have resorted to a CAP in response to a “final rejection” of an
application (arguably covering claims of questionable technological value) are present in

28

An alternate approach interacting application year dummies with each of the right hand
variables was estimated with similar results, but we do not report them here.
29
Patents applied for between 1981 and 2000 appear in this analysis only if they were granted by
2002. To negate biases due to truncation, we have employed a 4-year “window” for forward
citations for all patents in the dataset in order to minimize truncation bias. The “4-year window”
includes forward citations from the same year as the issue of a patent and three subsequent years.
The last year for citing patents in this analysis (for patents issued in 2002) is hence 2005.
32

the pre-1995 panel, but are excluded from post-1995 observations.30 The 1995 change in
patent term may have reduced the willingness of applicants with more valuable
inventions to accept a curtailed patent term in exchange for the benefits of continued
prosecution. We also find a striking increase in the direct effect of the interaction of
capital- and patent-intensity (β(CAPINT

X PATINT))

on the likelihood of CAP filings during

the 1995-2000 period. R&D-intensive firms that patent heavily (the relevant coefficient
here is β(RDINT

X PATINT))

are less likely to use CAP and CIP filings after 1995.31

The above results suggest that post-1995 CAPs are more likely than pre-1995
CAPs to be used for relatively unimportant patents, and to be used by defensive patenters.
Examining the extent of self-citations in backward citations for post-1995 patents issuing
from continuations provides additional evidence on the post-1995 use of CAPs in the
“defensive” patenting strategies of firms. This is because, a high proportion of backward
self-cites may be one consequence of a patenting strategy that seeks to accumulate
“thickets” of patents that overlap each other and hence cite each other. Figure 2 shows
that patents issuing from post-1995 CAPs contain a significantly higher proportion of
backward self-citations than any other group of patents, while CAPs prior to 1995 cited
their own patents less frequently than patents issuing from any other type of
continuation.32

30

This drop in quality of post-1995 CAPs holds for the larger sample of U.S.owned businesses as
can be seen in Table A6 of the Appendix.
31
We also examined the effects of firm-attributes on continuations choice for each of the five
major patent technology classes (corresponding MLNM estimates are presented in Tables A7.1 7.5 of the Appendix). Defensive patenters (coefficient on the interaction of patent intensity and
capital intensity) are more likely, and technology traders (coefficient on the interaction of
research intensity and capital intensity) are less likely to choose CAPs in their patents after 1995
in all sectors.
32
We examined this result in an OLS specification with the percentage of backward citations that
are self-citations as the dependent variable before and after 1995, and the 4 different continuation

Conclusion

The continuations procedure allows applicants to alter the timing and scope of their
issued patents in response to technological developments and the patenting activity of
competitors. Despite their widespread use in the U.S. by corporate assignees (nearly 30%
of all issued patents during 1981-2004 can be attributed to continuations), and despite the
various patent policy reforms addressing the use and abuse of continuations, the
procedure has received little attention from scholars of patent strategy. By examining the
characteristics of patents resulting from the three types of continuations between 1981
and 2004, and their U.S. owners, we have tried to provide some preliminary evidence on
the role of continuations in U.S. firms’ patenting behavior.
Continued patents pend for twice as long as patents without continuations in their
review history, and contain 50% more references to patented prior art (mostly attributable
to applicants). Our findings on the differences in the various characteristics of patents
issuing from the three types of continuations are consistent with the procedural
differences among the types. The “Continuation in Part” allows inventors to insert
additional material to a pending patent application and produces patents with the highest
number of claims, forward citations, and renewal probability. Patents in Drugs,
Medicine, and Chemicals --- industries in which patents are widely rated as important
mechanisms for capturing value from innovation --- are relatively frequent users of CIPs.
types as regressors. The estimates (in TableA9 of the Appendix) which included technologyclass controls confirmed the statistical significance of the increased selfcitations of CAP patents
in backward cites post-1995.
34

CIPs are also more likely to be filed by the smaller firms in our sample and are associated
with patents of high value.
One view of continuations argues that the procedure supports “pioneering”
inventors, allowing them to secure an early priority date while revising their claims
during review of their applications in technologies where patents are important to
appropriate the returns to R&D. Our results on CIPs appear consistent with this view.
But the economic and technological significance of patents resulting from CIPs, as well
as the tendency for these continuations to be used by smaller R&D-intensive firms, also
could be associated with the use by applicants of CIPs in submarine patenting strategies.
Our statistical tests are unable to distinguish the motives of applicants, and further
research with data on the composition of firms’ R&D, licensing, and litigation activity (to
identify pioneering inventors and submariners) is needed.
The “Continuation Application” is a second application for the same invention
claimed in a prior application, and produces patents that are qualitatively
indistinguishable from “ordinary” patents. The CAP extends the pendency period of an
application without providing for substantial changes, and is the most common type of
continuation within the Computers, Communication, and Semiconductor patents that
utilize the procedure (accounting for nearly half of all continuations filed in these
technologies during 1981-2000). These technologies are characterized by rapid change,
short technology cycle times, and the relative unimportance of patents as a means of
recouping R&D investments. CAP applicants, particularly those filing applications after
1995, disproportionately cite their own previous patents as prior art. These observations,
combined with our findings that CAPs are frequent among the low-value patents of firms

35

that patent intensively and have large sunk costs, can be interpreted as supporting various
forms of the “defensive patenting” interpretation of CAPs’ role in patent strategy.33
What implications do our analyses have for the patent and continuation reforms
recently discussed by the Patent Office and the U.S. Congress? Our results do not
support a definite characterization of the CIP as prone to abuse before or after 1995, but
they do suggest that skepticism concerning the benefits of the CAP is warranted.34
Hence, reform of the continuations process can benefit from a reexamination of the
purported benefits of the CAP, combined with more careful monitoring of the links
among patent value, firm characteristics, and litigation for patents issuing from CIPs.

33

This characterization is consistent with the views of a number of members of the patent bar and
rationalizes applicants’ use of continuations in accumulating low value or “junk” patents.
34
One element of these reform proposals is a rule that would require second or subsequent
continuations of an application to “include a showing as to why the amendment, argument, or
evidence presented could not have been previously submitted” (Official Gazette of the USPTO
2006). Although such petitions might impose significant additional burdens on the patent office,
they could aid patent examiners to evaluate CIPs more effectively. Our results do, however,
undermine the case for the “Continuation Application.”

dF/dx is for discrete change of dummy variables (y8690, y9195 & y9600) from 0 to 1;
z and P>|z| correspond to the test of the underlying coefficient being 0

Table A6 Notes: The above are estimates of a model where, the binary dependent variable indicates whether the patent
was issued from a CAP or no continuation (for the CAP analysis). The right hand side variables include four-year
citations (fcites), 32-category technological category (Class) and application period (App). The coefficient on the
interaction term ( Appt ∗ Fcites ) enables us to test for changes in the relationship between patent quality and CAPs
during the 1981 – 2002 period. Instead of using dummies for the twenty application years and their corresponding quality
interaction terms, we grouped the years into four application periods (1981-85, 1986-90, 1991-95, 1995-2000), after
ensuring that this does not affect our key results.
