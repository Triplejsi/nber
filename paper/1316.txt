A Reconsideration of the Effects of Unionism on
Relative Wages and Employment in the United States, 1920—80

ABSTRACT

H. Gregg Lewis' estimates of the relative wage effect of unionism between

1920 and 1958

are

routinely cited though they have rarely been subject to

scrutiny. This paper extends Lewis' data to 1980 and, in particular, we
construct a series on union membership that links up with the data available in

the 1970's from the Current Population Surveys. We proceed to reexamine the
effects of trade unions both on relative wages and on relative manhours worked.

Our estimates of the relative wage effect are similar to Lewis' though these are
not measured with precision and a wide range of estimates are consistent with

the results. With respect to the effect of unionism on relative manhours
worked, we are not at all satisfied that the analysis of these data clearly
points to the existence of a negative effect.

Introduction

When an economist publishes important, original, and potentially

contrQversial empirical results, it is usually the case that the data

and the procedures generating these results are scrutinized by other
economists.

The chains of reasoning that led to these findings are

examined, the data are inspected, and the estimates are checked to
determine whether the results claimed do, indeed, follow and, if so, to

ascertain the degree to which these results are sensitive to small
changes in the underlying assumptions.

It is, of course, this social

impartiality that
".
. objectivity

character of the discipline which gives rise to any
economics

is

can claim. As Popper (1966) expresses it,

closely bound up with the social aspect of scientific method, with

the fact that science and scientific objectivity do not (and cannot)
result from the attempts of an individual scientist to be "objective,t'
but

from the friendly—hostile cooperation of many scientists" (p. 217).

One study in economics that appears not to have been exposed to

this collective scrutiny

is H. Gregg Lewis' (1963, l961) estimates of

the relative wage and employment effects of U.S. trade unions over the
years 1920—58.
but

they

His results have justly received widespread attention,

are cited in a routine manner and, for the most part, they have

—2—

not been subject to the same critical evaluation accorded to other
empirical studies of comparable standing in economics.!' One of the
very few assessments of Lewis' estimates was

that

provided by Melvin

Reder (1965) in his insightful review of Lewis' book in the Journal of

Political Econonr for April 1965.

In this paper, Reder not only

supplied an excellent synopsis of Lewis' work, but also he clearly
identified the critical points In Lewis' empirical procedures and he
offered alternative explanantions for Lewis' findings. Indeed, some of
the most original research in measuring the effects of trade unions on

labor market variables are direct descendents of Reder's thoughtful
review articie..V

The purpose of this paper is to resume the process of evaluating
Lewis' work.

We have extended Lewis' data and his estimates of the

relative wage effects of unions from 1959 to 1980. We determine whether

the inferences from Lewis' regressions are sensitive to alternative
specifications of the equations Including making some allowance for
serial correlation in the estimated residuals.

We also take up the

question of the effects of unions on total manhours worked.

Our proce-

dure is first to specify what we call "descriptive equations" whose
purpose is essentially to describe the underlying empirical regularities

and where little recourse is made to structural labor supply and labor
demand equations.

We then specify a structural model, estimate the

parameters of that model, and draw inferences from these estimates about

the effects of unionism on relative wages and on relative manhours
worked. We turn first to a brief description of the data and the variables that we shall be using in our empirical analysis.3/

—3—

II. Description

of the Data

Lewis' purpose in Chapter VI of his book (1963) was

to

derive

estimates of the average union—nonunion wage differential for the U.S.

econor over the years from 1920 to 1958. Reduced to its essentials,
his procedure was to divide the economy into two sectors and, after
controlling for the effects of other variables, to compare the movements
in the logarithms of relative wages in the two sectors with movements in

the sectoral difference in the fraction of workers unionized. The two

sectors were denoted by a and b:

sector a consisted of the mining,

construction, manufacturing, transportation, communications, and public
utilities industries; sector b consisted of all other industries except

for government work relief and the U.S. military.

During the 1920—58

period examined by Lewis, more than 80 percent of the economy's union
workers were employed in sector a.

The task of extending beyond 1958 the data on hourly compensation,

manhours worked, and output in the two sectors is straightforward (if

tedious) and, although there exist some differences between Lewis'
procedures and our procedures in forming these variables, these differ-

ences are very small in our judgment. This is not the case, however,
with our series on the fraction of workers covered by collective bargaining contracts in the two sectors and our task in constructing these
series for the 1960's and 1970's was more forntLdable.J!J' (Our procedures

in forming these variables are given in detail in the Appendix.) For
these variables, our procedure was to start with the union coverage and

union nmbership data collected by the Current Population Surveys (cPs)

_14 —

in

the 1970's and then to link these data with those published

biennually by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the 1960's and
late 1950's. The resulting series are likely to be quite accurate for
the 1970's, but will surely be substantially less so for the preceding

We have tried to compile a series on the numbers of workers

represented by trade unions rather than a series on union membership.

In this respect, our concept is different from Lewis' although the
difference between the sectors in the fraction of workers represented by
unions (the variable to be used in most of' the empirical analysis below)

differs trivially from the sectoral difference in the fraction of
workers who are union numbers, at least for the years from 1977 to
l980.-J

Our estimates of the thousands of workers represented by trade
unions from 1958 to 1980 are listed in Table l those for sector a are

given in column (i), for sector b in column (ii), and for the entire
economy in column (iii); the fraction of full—time equivalent employees
represented by trade unions in sectors a and b is given in columns (iv)

and (v) respectively of Table 1 and the arithmetic difference in the
unionization proportions in the two sectors is given in column (vi).
The well—known decline in the extent of unionism in the "old" industries

is revealed by the unmistakable negative trend in the series in column
(iv). This has been offset only slightly by the growth in the extent of

unionism in sector b (primarily an expansion of unionism in
government). As column (vi) of Table 1 makes clear, and is evident from

Figure 1, the unionism difference between the two sectors narrowed
considerably between 1958 and 1980: whereas the fraction of sector a's

employees represented by unions was almost 50 percent greater in 1958
than the fraction of sector b's employees, by 1980 this difference had

almost halved to 28 percent. A difference between the two sectors of
this order of magnitude had not been recorded since the late 1930's.
(See Lewis (1963), Table 53.) However, in the late 1930's, well over

percent of all union workers were employed in sector a; by comparison,
the corresponding figure in 1980 was a little over 62 percent.-'

The mean values and standard deviation of the variables used in

the analysis are given In Table 2.

The sample data we use for the

period 1920—58 are identical to those used by Lewis except that for
several variables we altered his values for 1958 (the last observation
in his study) to take advantage of revisions in the figures by various

government agencies.L' These alterations were small and reestimating
Lewis' equations with these revised values for 1958 had trivial effects

on his estimated parameters.

As is evident in Table 2, the size of

sector a relative to sector b was smaller during the 1959—80 period than

in the 1920—58 period whether size is measured in terms of labor input

(total manhours) or in terms of output (national income). As we have

already noted, the fraction of employees represented by unions in
sector a was declining from 1958 to 1980 while that in sector b was
growing slightly.

Over the same period, the hourly compensation in

sector a relative to that in sector b traces a U—shape declining from
1.13 in 1958 to 1.29 in 1970 and then rising to 1.37 in 1980, the same

value as that in 1955.

should be emphasized that these data include not merely wages and
salaries, but also commissions, tips, bonuses, the value of payments in
kind, estimated employer contributions to pension and health plans, a.nd

compensation for injuries. However, as was the case with Levis' study
from 1920 to 1958,

these

compensation figures have not been adjusted for

changes in relative labor force composition except for shifts of
employment among large industry aggregates.

Therefore, some of the

movements in these relative compensation figures viii be attributable to

changes in the relative "quality" of the employees and, by not account-

ing for these changes in "quality," our procedures are likely to overestimate the true impact of unionism on relative wages. For, insofar as

unionized employers retain considerable discretion over employment

decisions, they are induced by a higher union wage to upgrade the
"quality" of their employees so that a part of what we measure as the

relative wage effect of unionism is likely to be, in fact, a wage
difference that corresponds to differences in the "quality" of the work

forces of unionized employers compared with those of nonunionized
employers. This was a limitation of Lewis' study and it applies also to
this one.

The other two variables listed in Table 2, X. and Z, describe
two features of the econonv at the aggregate level.

Both of these

variables were used by Levis in his analysis. X. is the ratio of the
price level to the value implied by the recent trend in prices. That

when prices in year t are much higher than their recent values) and

Consider now the consequences of permitting the relative wage
effect of unionism to vary over the years from 1920 to 1980.

Lewis

conjectured that unionism tended to reduce the responsiveness of money

wages of union labor to transitory changes in the general price level
and in employment. If this is the case,

would fall when such tran-

sitory elements are positive and Bt

would rise when transitory

elements are negative; that is,

would vary with the business cycle,

being largest in the contraction phase and being smallest in the
expansionary phase of the cycle. To implement this hypothesis, return
to equation (5) and express

as a function, first, of the logarithm

of the ratio of the price level in period t to its level in and
immediately prior to year t (n x) and, second, of the unemployment
rate (Zt):

Bt = b0 + b1 £n X + b2Zt

Substituting this expression for

Moreover, simply evaluating the
is more responsive to movements in

the inflation variable than to movements in unemployment: for instance,
using equation (7d)'s estimates, estimated at the sample mean values of

n X and Z., a one standard deviation increase in Ln X (with the
unemployment rate constant) reduces the implied value of

from 23.1

percent to 9.1 percent whereas a one standard deviation increase in Z.
(holding the inflation variable constant) reduces the implied value of

from 23.1 to i6.6 percent. These results replicate Lewis' findings

that unionism tended to make the money wages of union labor less
responsive to sudden movements in the general price level while the
evidence associating unionism's relative wage impact to the unemployment
rate is considerably weaker.

The four equations in Table 5 imply similar movements in Bt over

the 1920—80 period. Columns (i) and (ii) of Table 6 present the point
estimates and standard errors of

corresponding to equations (Tc)

and (Td) averaged over the values of £n X and Z. in each subperiod
and in the 1920—80 period as a whole. According to these estimates, the
average relative wage effect of unionism, r, over the entire period was

between 18.5 percent and 26.0 percent, values virtually identical to

those inlied by equations (6e) and (6f) in Table 1• The point estimates of

r

range widely over the six decades from a maximum in the

first half of the 1930's to a minimum in the second half of the
1970's. These fluctuations tend to be slightly greater when measured by

conventional least—squares than when estimated by generalized least—
squares. However, the standard errors attached to the point estimates
of

caution against any confident statements about the precise

magnitude of the relative wage effect in any subperiod: for instance,

according to equation (Td), a 95 percent confidence interval on
ranges from 15.3 percent to 88.3 percent in the early 1930's and from
—14.9 percent to 29.1 percent in the late 1970's. That these union wage

effects in particular subperiods are estimated very imprecisely was

noted by Lewis, but this fact is typically overlooked by others
reporting these estimates.-&!

The point estimates of

in Table 6 for the l960's do not

differ appreciably from those for the 1950's, but those in the 1970's
are noticeably lower.

In view of the relatively high values taken by

the inflation variable, £n X, in the 1970's, these lower values of
in this decade should not occasion mich surprise. The disturbing aspect

—20—

of

this result is that it does not appear to conform to the measurement

of the relative wage effects of unionism as estimated from various large

data sets on individuals. For instance, Ashenfelter's (1978) analysis

of individuals in the CPSs suggests an average value of B that rises
from 11.6 percent in 1967 to 114.8 percent in 1973 and to 16.8 percent in
1975.

Or Moore and Raisian's (1983) analysis of the Income Dynamics

Panel for male heads of households suggests either a rising trend or no

trend (depending upon the particular equation specification) in the
union—nonunion wage differential from 1967 to 1977.

George Johnson

(1983) presents more evidence against the notion of a falling union
relative wage effect in the 1970's.

The changes estimated in these

studies are not always measured very precisely, nor are those estimated

in Table 6, so not too much should be made of this difference.
Nevertheless, insofar as our point estimates of'

in the 1970's

contradict those inferred from the analysis of large data sets on
individual workers, we are inclined to place more credence in the union
wage

effects estimated from the latter than in those estimated from

highly aggregated data such as those in this paper.
One possible reconciliation that we
tionship between

was that

the rela-

on the one hand and the inflation variable and the

unemployment rate on the other hand differed in the 1920—58 period that

Lewis analyzed from that obtaining after 1958.

In

fact, a conventional test of the null hypothesis that b1 and b2 are

Consider, therefore, measuring

Clearly, even allowing for a

in the post—1958 period, our point

estimates of unionism's relative wage effect remain unchanged and, in
particular, we continue to estimate a lower relative wage effect in the
1970's compared with the preceding decade.&1'

To conclude this section, we report briefly the consequences of
addressing two other issues. First, we examined the effects of treating

unionism and relative output as endogenous in equation (7). The unionism variable, F, almost certainly contains measurement error while the
relative output produced in sectors a and b, £n Q, is surely a function,

in part, of the relative wages in the two sectors: for both P and

£n Q, there exists good reason for considering instrumental variable

estimates of the relative wage equation.i2! The results were not at
variance with those reported in Tables 5 and 6 because the standard
errors of the resulting estimates were so large as to encompass a very

wide range of different values including the point estimates of
already reported. This should serve to underline the uncertainty that

—22—

surrounds the point estimates of

in particular subperiods.-9J

Second, we took up Reder's (1965) "one substantive criticism" of
Lewis' regression specifications. Reder writes, "It is unlikely- that the

effect of unemployment on relative wage rates was constant throughout
the period.

In the 1930's when unemployment was very high, New Deal

legislation and political intervention worked substantially to raise
wages In the unIon sector relative to the non—union, thereby giving a
downward bias to the estimate of the effect of unemployment on the ratio

of union to non—union wages."

We implemented Reder's hypothesis by

creating a dumny variable taking the value of unity from the years 1932
to 1941 inclusive.

Then, first, we added this variable to the vector

in estimating equation (7) and, second, in addition, we allowed
to be a function of this dumnr variable. Estimating these equations

left our inferences from Tables 5 and 6 unaltered and the hypothesis
that the effect of unemployment on Bt was the same in the 1930's as in
other decades could not be rejected.-'

B.

Manhours Worked

The empirical analysis reported above concerned the effect of
unionism on relative wages.?i The results strongly suggest a positive
union—nonunion wage differential although the magnitude of this differ—

ential is not estimated with any useful precision.

Now, according to

one popular characterization of the determination of wages and employment in unionized markets, any wage increases effected by trade unions

will be associated with decreases in the utilization of the labor
input. Therefore, it seems natural to enquire whether, over the period

—23—

1920—80, movements of total manhours worked in sector a relative to
sector b are negatively associated with movements in the difference in
as the effect

unionism In the two sectors. For this purpose define

on the logarithm of manhours in sector a relative to sector b of an
increase in the difference between sectors a and b in the fraction of
workers unionized.

In other words, what

is to wages,

is to

manhours. Then, consider the following equations which are the manhours

no association between Pt and tn Et. The specification of equation
(9b) in Table 7

is

the same as Levis' (l961). In the estimates based on

equation (9), the estimates of the parameters c0, c1, and c2 change a
good deal from equation to equation and often they are not significantly

different from zero.

The implied point estimates of

in Table 8

tend to move in the opposite direction from those for Be__that is, the

manhours effects tend to be most negative in the early 1930's and, if
negative, are close to zero in the late 1970's——but they are almost as
frequently insignificantly different from zero as different from zero on

two—tailed t—tests. Though there are slightly more negative values of

than positive values in columns (iv) and (v) of Table 8 and though
the negative estimates are greater in absolute value than the positive

estimates, they hardly constitute powerful evidence that unionism has
depressed the level of manhours worked in sector a relative to sector b.

IV. Structural

Equations

The estimates presented in the previous section have been labelled
as those from "descriptive equations" in the sense that they have not
made explicit use of structural labor supply and demand functions. In
fact, Levis did outline a structural model although he did not estimate

all its parameters. The attractive feature of this structural approach
is that, instead of the wage effect of unionism being measured indepen-

dently of the effect of unionism on total manhours worked, the two
effects are estimated as part of a single system of equations.

It is

important to observe that Levis' structural supply and demand model

—27—

assumes that, if trade unions engineer a wage increase, unionized
employers reduce manhours worked by moving back along their labor demand

functions; wages and employment do not lie on the two parties' contract
curve.

The relative demand function for labor is assumed to take the
following simple form:

Zn

where both

and 2 are expected to be positive.

The manhours

supplied is given by the following equation:

In other words, at Zn W, the

number of manhours supplied in the absence of unionism would be

accordance with the findings of the previous section, specify Bt as a

function of the inflation variable, Zn X, and the unemployment rate,
Zt:

The equations determining the logarithms of equilibrium wage rates and
equilibrium manhours, Zn

and Zn E, respectively are as follows:

Consider now the relationship between these equilibrium relative
wages and manhours on the one hand and the observed values of relative

wages and manhours on the other hand. Lewis argued that, even in the
absence of unionism, wage rates in each sector might not adjust to the
same supply and demand conditions (that define their equilibrium values)

at the same rate.

In this event, transitory- changes in the general

price level (n x) and in unemployment (Z) will induce movements in
the ratio of wage rates in the two sectors relative to their equilibrium
values.-J'

most noticeable about these values of

is that only infrequently

(l925_3l) can we reject the null hypothesis that

different from zero. This result is consistent with the general inferences from estimating the "descriptive equations" (8) and (9):

while

negative impacts of unionism on relative manhours are often estimated,
these

effects are imprecisely estimated and confident inferences about

are unwarranted.

Thus, the inferences from

these structural estimates are in line

with those from the "descriptive equations" in Section III.

There is

strong evidence of a positive relative wage effect of unionism for much

of the period from 1920 to 1980 and our best estimate is that it aver-

aged around 12 percent. This estimate,

however, is not measured with

—32—

much confidence.

There exists less compelling evidence of a negative

effect of unionism on relative manhours worked and the null hypothesis

that there exists no effect of unionism on relative manhours is fre—
q.uently compatible with the evidence.

The proposition that unionism

depressed manhours worked in sector a below those worked in sector b can

be accepted with some assurance only in the late 1920's and early
1930's.

V. Conclusions

The empirical analysis in this paper of the U.S. labor market from

1920 to 1980 leads us to conclude that, for most of this period, there
is strong evidence of a positive impact of unionism on the average wage

of union workers relative to the average wage of nonunion workers. The

of this impact appears not to have been the same over the
sixty years, but seems to have been larger than average in the early

magnitude

1930's

and smaller than average in the late 1910's and late 1970's.

However, these relative wage effects are not measured with precision and

a large number of different possible values for the effect of unions on

relative wages are consistent with the evidence.

These conclusions

concerning relative wages (with the obvious exception concerning the
effects in the 1970's) including the imprecision with which the relative
wage impact of unionism is measured duplicate Lewis' findings.

The aggregate data imply a declining relative wage effect of
unionism from the late 1960's to the late 1970's whereas the evidence
from microeconontic studies tends not to accord with this finding. This

—33—

may indicate that, owing perhaps to the growth of cost—of—living escala-

tor clauses in collective bargaining contracts, the nature of the
relationship associating the relative wage impact with macroeconomic
variables (such as abnormal rates of inflation) changed in the 1960's
and 1970's from the preceding decades.

However, when we allowed for

this possibility, our estimates yielded virtually the same inferences.
Alternatively, this may indicate a mis—specification in the relationship
for the entire period:

if the sort of microeconomic studies that have

been undertaken in the past ten years or so could be conducted with data
on individuals from the 1930's and 19140's, perhaps these also would have

produced estimates at variance with those from the aggregate

It would be tempting to declare the results from the microeconomic
studies as being the correct ones and to dismiss our estimates as being

plagued with aggregation bias, but it should be noted that, if this is
the case, then this means that the point estimates for the 1970's from

the aggregate data tend towards underestimating the true impact of
unionism on relative wages.

In fact, in this literature on unions and

wages, it is more frequently argued that the use of aggregate data
produces an upward biased estimate of the true impact. We conclude that

we do not know why the implications from fitting the equations to the

aggregate time—series data do not agree with those from fitting wage
equations to individual cross—section data in different years.

Although we are not at all confident about the precise magnitude
of the effect of unionism on relative wages over the years from 1920 to
1980, we are satisfied that a positive effect existed for most of these

years. By contrast, when it comes to the effect of unionism on relative
manhours worked, we are not at all satisfied that the analysis of these

data unambiguously points to a negative effect.

We nre frequently

estimate negative effects of unionism on relative manhours worked than
positive effects, but the estimates are disturbingly sensitive to small

changes in the specification of the estimating equation.
negative

Even when

manhour effects are calculated, our estimated standard errors

do not permit us to make any useful confident statements and quite often

we cannot reject the null hypothesis that unionism has not had any
effect on relative manhours worked.
A fertile mind can think up a number of explanations for these
results with respect to manhours worked, but one possibility is that
Lewis' characterization of union wage behavior is not appropriate in all

labor markets.

According to Lewis' characterization, the unionized

employer remains on his wage—taking labor demand function so the union's

wage increase is achieved at the expense of a reduction in employment or

manhours worked. This is a popular model of the way in which manhours
are determined in unionized labor markets, but this popularity has not
come about because it has been corroborated in a large number of empirical studies.

the

On the contrary, there has been little attempt to test

empirical relevance of this model. In

fact, by comparison with the

number of studies designed to measure the relative wage impact of
unionism, there have been few attempts to quantify the effects of union-

ism on manhours worked. This is surely an issue that deserves to be the
subject of much

more research.

—35-.

In

conclusion, we should like to emphasize that none of our

results in this paper is at variance with Lewis' results and none of
Lewis' judgments has required important qualification or modification.

His research has been shown to possess a durability that few pieces of

scholarship published In economics today are likely to have.

Thus

Reder's conjecture that, as a comprehensive analysis of the relative
wage and employment effects of unionism, Lewis' work would be the best
for a long time

to

come has been confirmed.

To provide one comparison, consider the literature emanating from
Harberger's (1962, 1966) estimates of the incidence of the corpor-

ation income tax which were published around the same time as
Lewis' estimates -of the economy—wide relative wage effects of
unionism. Harberger's procedures and results immediately spawned
a large literature: the model underlying his estimates was anal-

yzed extensively, his numerical calculations were checked, and
other economists determined whether his particular results could

be produced by other methods. In fact, it transpired that there
were both arithmetical and conceptual errors in Harberger's anal-

ysis (see Shoven, 1976). A discussion of this literature may be
found in Atkinson and Stiglitz (1980).

This is true, for instance, of the research investigating the con—

sequences for measuring union relative wage effects of treating

unionism as an endogenous variable. See Ashenfelter and Johnson
(1972).

A complete description of our data and of our methods in assembling the data are contained in the Appendix.

—37—

We linked our series to Lewis' series

P2

(i.e., his adjusted

estimates of the fraction unionized where the adjustment coefficient is 0.5).

This statement rests on a comparison of the membership data and
representation data collected by the CPSs for 1977 to 1980. These

figures were divided by the number of full—time equivalent
employees.

The resulting difference between sector a and sector b

in the fraction of workers who are union members is 0.255 in 1977,
0.2143 in 1978, 0.21414 in 1979, and 0.230 in 1980. By contrast, the

difference between sector a and sector b in the fraction of
workers represented by unions is 0.253 in 1977, 0.2143 in 1978,
0.2145 in 1979, and 0.230 in 1980.

Thts negative association after 1958 between the fraction union-

ized in sector a and the fraction unionized in sector b forms a
marked contrast with the 1920—58 period: the simple correlation

coefficient between Pa and b over the years 1920—58 is +0.972
while that during the period 1959—80 was —0.859. For the entire

1920—80 period the correlation coefficient between a and
is +0.7143.

The variables whose values for 1958 were changed from those used
by Lewis were national income originating in the two sectors,
total manhours worked per year, thousands of workers covered by

collective bargaining agreements, full—time hours worked per
worker per year, full—time equivalent employees, and the unemploy—

ment rate. The values of these variables that we used are given

When we embarked on our analysis, we employed two series for Z

in the post—1958 period:

the unemployment rate in the entire

labor force and the unemployment rate of white men aged 35_1
years.

The idea here was that, with a growing number of

"secondary" workers in the labor force in the 1960's and 1970's,
the overall unemployment rate might incorporate labor force compo-

sition effects that would render its movements less comparable
with the movements in the unemployment rate before 1958. In fact,

the results from using the unemployment rate of white men aged
35.1 years differed by only a very small amount from those using
the overall unemployment rate so we retained the latter.

This is, of course, only one possible meaning of "the relative

these workers would have received in the absence of unionism. For

a thorough treatment of different concepts, see Lewis (1963),
Chapter II.

For instance, the estimates of r in sector a range from 52.8
percent in equation (3b) to l1.5 percent in equation (3e) whereas
r

the estimates of

in sector b range from 69.2 percent in

equation (3c) to a negative value in equation (3e).

The estimates in equations (6a) and (6b) are similar to Lewis' in

his Table 58.

We

estimated to the entire 1920—80 period the

specifications of the equations given in regression numbers 2
and 4 of Lewis' Table 60 and yielded almost identical results.
Our one difference occurs when comparing the estimates of B in
equations (6c) and (6d) of Table )4 with regression number 1 in
Lewis' Table 62:

our estimate of B for the 1920—80 period is

almost double Lewis' for the 1920—58 period.

In this instance,

Lewis' unionism variable is not measured by his P2 series that
we have used. If we fit the specification given by equation (6e)

to the 1920—58 period only, the coefficient ° Pt is 0.160 with

partial effect of £n X on Bt is less negative in the post—
1958 period and the partial effect of Z on

tive in the post—1958 period by comparison with the pre—1958

the preceding two decades, these two effects on

peak of the unemployment rate registered in the preceding
recession,

the

fraction of Democrats

in

the House of

Representatives, and a dummy variable taking the value of zero
before 1932 and of unity from 1932 onwards. This last variable is

designed to reflect the change in the attitude of government and

the courts towards unionism as signalled first by the Norris—

—11—

La Guardia Act. The peak of the unemployment rate in the preceding recession and the fraction of Democrats in the House of Repre-

sentatives were variables used (among others) by Ashenfelter and

Pencavel (1969) to account for the level of unionism in the
econonj in year t conditional upon the level in the year t — 1.
The average value of

for the entire 1920—80 period according

to the specification in equation (Tb) is 0.121 with an estinted
standard error of o.io6.

For instance, interacting this 1930's duinnr

variable

with the

unemployment rate according to the specification in equation (Ta)
and then testing for the joint significance of the coefficients on

these interactions yields a calculated

F

statistic of 2.73

compared with a critical value of 3.18.

We also considered the consequences of specifying a stochastic

component in the determination of B. If this were the case,

then the error term in the estimating equation will not be
homoskedastic, but will be a function of P. The results from
addressing this issue——both those that assume

those reported in Tables 1 and 5.

Our procedure here is different from Lewis' (1961). He took his

Lewis estimated his equation in first differences and in none of
the specifications in Table 7 can the bypothesis that the first—
order serial correlation parameter is unity be rejected.

This is a drastic precis of Lewis' argument and we encourage the
reader to consult pages 213—20 of his book.

In fact, Lewis specified a different adjustment coefficient in the

distributed lag on manhours demanded from that on manhours
supplied. However, if the number of manhours supplied equals the

number of manhours demanded, as he assumed, there is no way

of

identifying the two parameters separately.

The Durbin—Watson statistic calculated from the values of

u1

is 1.70 while Durbin's h statistic calculated from the values of

u2. is 0.93.

The estimates of this parameter 2 seem to be sensitive to the
particular specification of the model. For instance, if no serial
correlation in

of

rises to L.9l4 with an estimated standard error of 0.7I

time were not drawn only- from the aggregate data, but also from

the examination of a number of studies of particular industries
and occupations.

These studies, however, bad at their disposal

fewer underlying observations than those that are available on
magnetic tape and that have been the basis of so much work in the
last decade.

Appendix

Trade Union Representation

For the years from 1958 to 1980, the only continuous series on

union membership is that from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS)

survey of unions published in the Directory of National Unions and
Employee Associations. Because this is a biennial survey, data at an

industry level are available not each year, but

every two years and

values for intervening years must be estimated or interpolated. Even
ignoring this problem, the Directory series has a number of features
that render it suspect as reliable information on union membership by
industrial sector.

First, although the aggregated data that are published distinguish

between union membership within the United States and that abroad (pri—

manly Canada), this distinction is not made at the industrial level.
Moreover, Canadian membership has not remained a constant fraction of

membership of all unions with headquarters in the United States:
whereas in 1958 Canadian union membership represented 5.8 percent of
total membership of unions with headquarters in the U.S., by 1978 this
had risen to 7.1 percent.

A second problem with the membership data published in the

tory is

that unions are thought to inflate their membership figures to

present

a slightly exaggerated impression of their size. Unemployed and

retired members who are not paying their union dues are often kept on
the union books. The retention of some of the unemployed on the member-

ship rolls is especially relevant to a time—series on union membership

_147_

given that the amplitude of business cycle movements in employment and

working hours in highly unionized industries is much greater than in
less unionized industries.

These two factors tend to make the Directory figures an exaggerated

estimate of the true union membership figures. A third factor

pulls in the opposite direction and this concerns the distinction
between union membership and the coverage of collective bargaining
contracts negotiated by trade unions.

The concept required in the

analysis in the main body of the paper is the compensation of workers
covered by union—negotiated contracts as a proportion of total employee
compensation.

Insofar as this is approximated more closely by the

number of workers covered by collective bargaining contracts as a frac-

tion of all employees, then it is coverage data rather than union membership data that are to be preferred. Now it is thought that, although

the BLS surveys request information on union membership, some unions
report their representation. Other unions do not, however, and in this

event the reported membership figures may fall short of the coverage
data. Some idea of the importance of this coverage—membership distinc-

tion can be gauged by the information in the first five columns of
Table A which is taken from the May Current Population Surveys (CPS) for

the years 1977, 1978, 1979, and 1980. In each of these years, the CPS

asked the question "Are you a member of a union or employee
association?" and, if the response was "no," then it proceeded with the

question "Is your job covered or represented by a union?" The figures
in the first five columns of Table A present the ratio of union

Union Coverage and Membership from the Current Population Surveys, 1977—80

Table A

representation to union membership by industry for the years 1977—80.
The coverage—to—membership ratio is consistently higher in sector b than
in sector a.

The information collected by the CPS represents the nest accurate

data on union coverage and so, in constructing our time series on the
fraction unionized in sectors a and b over the years 1958—80, we started

with these data for the years 1977—80 and worked backwards to the late
1950's.

These CPS data in 1977—80 contain one problem for our

purposes: in addition to membership in labor unions, they cover membership in employee associations, many of which do not engage in collective

bargaining. These employee associations are in the public administration and service industries and fortunately the data collected by the
BLS and published in the Directory distinguish between employee association membership and labor union membership. During the years 1977—80

only one Directory was published that provides this breakdown by
industry between employee association membership and trade union member-

ship and this is the Directory relating to 1978.

According to the

Directory, in 1978 there were 5,1150 (thousands) members of labor unions

and 2,6314 (thousands) members of employee associations in the service

industries and government combined. Or labor union membership represented 67.14 percent (that is, 51450/80814) of total membership in this

broad industrial category.

According to the 1978 Current Population

Survey, total labor union and employee association membership in
services and public administration was 5,818.2 (thousands) so that an
estimate of labor union membership (excluding employee associations) in

—50—

the 1978 CPS is 67.1 percent of 5,818.2 or 3,922.6 (thousands).

As

given in the second column of Table A, the ratio of union coverage to
union membeship in 1978 in services and public administration was 1.2109

so that an estimate of the numbers of workers represented by trade
unions (excluding employee associations) in this sector in 1978 is
1.2109 x 3,922.lL6 =

1,7I9.7

which is entered in the seventh column of

Table A.

As has

been

mentioned, during the years 1977—80 only the Directory

providing data for 1978 supplies information on employee association
membership and labor union membership separately for different industries. Hence for the years 1977, 1979, and 1980 for services and public
administration, we multiplied each of the membership figures reported in

the Current Population Surveys (namely, 5,653.3 in 1977, 6,35.7 in
1979, and 6,555.0 in 1980) by 67.1 percent to derive an estimate of
union membership (excluding employee association membership) and then

inflated each figure by the ratio of representation to membership as
given in the first, third, and fourth columns of Table A (namely, 1.217
in 1977, 1.199 in 1979, and 1.2014 in 1980). This procedure yielded the

figures in the sixth, eighth, and ninth columns of Table A, namely,
14,637.6 in 1977, 5.203.9 in 1979, and 5,319.8 in 1980. The numbers of

—51—

Before 1977, the CPS asked just one question concerning union
membership,

namely, "Does . . . belong

to a labor union?"-—employee

assocations are not mentioned nor is coverage. The membership data for
the years 1976, 1975, 19714, 1973, 1970,

and 1966 are

given in Table B.

The 1966 CPS provides information on the union membership of private
workers

only.

The 1970 CPS gives data on the membership status of

private workers and government workers separately and the ratio by
industry of all union members to private union members was calculated
from the 1970 data. This ratio was then applied to the private workers
in 1966 in order to derive an estimate of all (private plus government)

union members in 1966. Of the two columns under 1966 in Table B, the
left column provides the data on private union memberships as given in
the 1966 CPS while the right column represents the adjusted figures that
incorporate an estimate of union membership among government workers.

In order to derive from these membership data in Table B an esti-

mate of the numbers covered by union contracts, we multiplied the
numbers in Table B by the ratios given in the fifth column of Table A
(that is, 1.111 for mining, 1.061 for construction, and so on). These
numbers in the fifth column of Table A represent the ratio by industry

of union coverage to union membership averaged over the four years
1977—80. The resulting estimates by broad industry groups of workers

covered by union contracts in 1966, 1970, and 1973—76 are given in
Table C.

Estimates of the Thousands of Workers Represented by Trade Unions in 1966, 1970, and 1973—76

Table C

—514—

All the information on union membership and coverage presented so

far has been taken from the CPSs.

However, these Surveys did not

collect information on union membership or union coverage back to the
late 1950's so, in order to extend the series back to those years, we
must rely on the data collected every two years by- the BLS and published

in the Directory of National Unions and Employee Associations. For the

years 1976, 19714, 1970, and 1966, a comparison of the CPS—based estimates of the number of workers covered by trade union contracts as given

in Table C with trade union membership (excluding employee association
membership) as published in the Directory is provided in Table D. Here

the ratios of the representation figures in Table C to the membership
figures published in the Directory show a systematic difference between
sector a

industries

(mining,

construction,

manufacturing,

transportation, communications, and public utilities) and sector b
industries (wholesale and retail trade, finance, insurance, and real
estate, services and public administration, and agriculture, forestry,

and fisheries). Whereas the Directory figures on union membership tend
to exceed (and, sometimes, exceed substantially) the numbers represented

by unions in sector a, the membership figures in the Directory for

sector b industries tend to understate the numbers represented by
unions.

Essentially, our

procedure for generating a series on the

numbers of workers represented by trade unions before 1966 in sectors a
and b was

to

adjust the reported membership data as published in the

Ratio of Estimated Union Representation to Union Membership

Directory by the estimates of the ratio of union representation to union

membership as given in Table D. An account of our precise methods now
follows.

Note that to this point, estimates of the numbers of workers
represented by trade unions in sectors a and b have been derived for the

years from 1973 to 1980 plus the years 1970 and 1966. Before turning to
the pre—1966 data, consIder filling the holes in the series between 1970

and 1973 and between 1966 and 1970. For the year 1972, we averaged the
1971L and 1970 ratios by industry of union representation to Directory

union nmbership as given in Table D and then multiplied the resulting

average for each industry by the published Directory membership in
1972.

The number of workers represented by trade unions in 1972 as

estimated this way is l2,99)-.9 (thousands) in sector a and 6,308.5
(thousands) in sector b. For 1971, each sector's representation figures

for 1972 and 1970 were averaged: this yielded 13,081.6 (thousands) for
sector a and 6,027.6 (thousands) for sector b. For the year 1968, each
industry's ratio of representation to Directory membership for 1966 and
1970 (as given in Table D) was averaged and then this average ratio for
each industry was then multiplied by the published Directory membership
in 1968. The estimated number of workers represented by trade unions in

1968 is 13,827.3 (thousands) in sector a and 5,632.0 (thousands) in
sector b. For 1969, each sector's representation figures for 1968 and
1970 were averaged, while for 1967 each sector's representation figures
for 1968 were averaged: according to this procedure, sector a's union

—57—

representation was 13,901.0 (thousands) in 1967 and 13,1497.8 (thousands)

in 1969 while the corresponding figures for sector b are 14,791.6
(thousands) in 1967 and 5,689.3 (thousands) in 1969.

Now consider constructing the series on the number of workers
represented by trade unions in sectors a and b for the years before
1966. Our procedure was to adjust the membership data published every
two years in the Directory by an estimate of the ratio of the number of

workers represented by unions to the number of members reported in the
Directory. For the manufacturing, transport, communications, and public
utilities, and wholesale and retail trade industrial groups, the ratios
we used to adjust the Directry membership figures were a simple average
of the numbers in Table D for 1966, 1970, 19714, and 1976. These ratios

were 0.931 for manufacturing, 0.826 for transport, communications, and

public utilities, and 1.392 for wholesale and retail trade.

The

finance, insurance, and real estate membership data are not distinguished from the services and public administration data in the

tory for 1970 and 1966 so for these two industry groups the ratios we
used to adjust the pre—1966 Directory data were computed as averages of

the 19714 and 19T6 numbers in Table D alone.

This yields a ratio of

representation to Directory membership of 5.379 for finance, insurance,

and real estate and of 1.0147 for services and public administration.

Similarly, the union membership data for agriculture, forestry, and
fisheries were not separately identified in the Directry membership for
1966 so for this industry the ratio of union representation to Directory

membership was computed from the 1970, 19714, and 1976 entries of

—58—

Table D.

This yields a ratio for this industrial group of l.b57.

Finally, for mining and construction, we used the ratio of union representation to Directory membership as revealed by the 1966 Directory data

alone, namely, 0.751 for mining and 0.823 for construction. The reason

for not using the ratios averaged over the four years for these two
industries in Table D (in which case the ratios would have been 0.667
for mining and 0.T1O for construction) is that the numbers in the 1970's

are heavily influenced by the growing numbers of retired United Mine
Workers' members in the case of mining and by the growth in nonunion
construction in the case of the construction industry. For the purpose
of constructing a series on union representation in the early 1960's and

late 1950's, we suspect that the 1966 data on the ratio of representation to Directory membership are likely to yield a more accurate esti—

mate of union representation for these two industries than would an
average of the 1966, 1970, 19714, and 1976 ratios.

With these ratios of union representation to Directory membership,

we then went to the biennial issues of the Directory from 1958 to 1966

and multiplied these ratios by each industry's reported membership
figure in each year. The results when aggregated across industries to
form sectors a and b are shown in columns Ci) and (ii) of Table E. Now
because the ratios of union representation to Directory membership that

we used to adjust the Directory membership data were not based on the
1966 information alone (except for mining and construction), there is no

guarantee that the estimates of numbers represented by unions in 1966
from so adjusting the Directory membership will equal the estimates of

numbers represented by unions in 1966 from the CPSs. Indeed, as given
in Table C, the latter are 13,97i.8 (thousands) for sector a and 3,951.1

(thousands) for sector b, whereas the implied figures for union representation in 1966 by adjusting the Directory memberships data (as given

in columns (i) and (ii) of Table E) are 13,212.9 (thousands) for
sector a and 5,153.4 (thousands) for sector b.

Consequently, we then

returned to the pre—1966 data and readjusted sector a's series by unilti—

plying each year's observation by 1.0577

(

13,9714.8/13,212.9) and

readjusted sector b's series by multiplying each year's observation by
0.7670 (=

3,951.1/5,153.1).

The resulting series is given for sector a

in column (iii) of' Table E and for sector b in column (iv) of Table E.

Finally, for the intervening odd numbered years between 1956 and 1966,

the series on numbers of workers represented by trade unions in
columns (iii) and (iv) of Table E were linearly interpolated.

The

numbers so constructed for the years from 1958 to 1980 are given in
Table 1: the estimated numbers of workers covered by union contracts in

sector a are in column (i), those in sector b are in column (ii), and
those in the entire econorxr are in column (iii); column (iv) gives the

numbers in column (i) divided by the number of full—time equivalent

employees in sector a; column (v) gives the numbers in column (ii)
divided by the number of full—time equivalent employees in sector b;
column (vi) is the difference between the numbers in columns (iv) and

those in column (v); and the numbers in column (vii) are those in

column (iii) divided by the total number of full-time equivalent
employees.

How accurate are these estimates of the numbers represented by
trade unions and how do the estimates in this paper compare with other

estimates? Those estimates computed from the CPSs in the 1970's are
likely to be quite accurate. Those inferred from the published

membership data are likely to contain nontrivial errors of measure—

tory

inent.

bargaining contracts in

Leo Troy (1969) has carefully compiled

labor union membership data on a consistent basis for the years 1961—66

and the total numbers of workers covered by union contracts as calcu-

lated in this paper average 2.8 percent higher than his membership
data. A differential such as this is to be expected insofar as union
coverage estimates tend to exceed union membership estimates.

If we

were to extend our procedures back to 1956, our implied estimates of the

fraction of workers represented by trade unions are those given in
columns (i) and (ii) of Table F.

Lewis' estimates of the extent of

union membership are given in columns (iv) and (v), (vii) and (viii),
and Cx) and (xi).

Again, for both sectors a and b, Lewis' membership

estimates never exceed and are usually smaller than our representation
estimates.

The variable used in most of the regression analysis,

however, is the arithmetic difference between the fraction unionized in
sectors a and b and a comparison of our estimates of this difference in
column (iii) with Lewis' estimates in columns (vi), (ix), and (xii) will

reveal smaller discrepancies between our estimates and Lewis'. It would
be absurd to pretend that our unionism data so constructed do not

contain serious defects.

They certainly contain errors of unknown

magnitude although it is doubtful whether these errors are greater than

those underlying Lewis' series.

Lewis, of course, was fully aware of

the shortcomings of his own data and, indeed, we may conclude by recoin—

mending the reader consult Lewis' own discussion of these issues——first
pages 258—76 of his book and then pages 198—201.

Apart from the CPS tapes, the published documents consulted in
preparing these series on union representation are as follows.

The

issues of the Directory of National Unions and Employee Associations
consisted of Bureau of Labor Statistics Bulletins 2079, 201114, 1937,

1750, 1665, 1596, l493, 1395, 1320, 1267, and 1222. The Directory for
1973 appears not to have been issued as a BLS Bulletin. Also consulted

were U.S. Department of Commerce, Population Characteristics:

Labor

Union Membership in 1966, Current Population Reports, Series P—20,

No. 216, March 1971; U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor
Statistics, Selected Earnings and Demographic Characteristics of Union
Members, 1970, Report 1117, 1972; and Courtney D. Gifford, ed., Directory

of U.S. Labor Organizations 1982—83 Edition, Bureau of National Affairs,
Washington, D.C. 1982.

National Income

The

national income originating from each of the ten major

industry divisions is to be found in Table 6.3B of the Department of

Commerce's National Income and Product Accounts.

The figures for

1957—75 are from tAl and those for 1976—80 are from EBI.

Sector a's

figure for each year is derived by adding the national income

originating in the following industry divisions: mining; construction;

manufacturing; and transportation and public utilities.

Sector b's

figure for each year is derived by adding the national income
originating in the following industry groups: wholesale trade; retail

trade; finance, insurance, and real estate; services; government and
government enterprises except the military; and agriculture, forestry,
and fisheries. To exclude national income originating in the military,
the total compensation of military employees (Table 6.5B) was subtracted
from the government and government enterprises entry.

The figures thus constructed were linked to Lewis' series as they
appear in his Table 59, page 211, although we linked our numbers to his

1957 figure rather than to his 1958 figure. That is, we replaced his
1958 indices of 1.286 for sector a and 3.923 for sector b with 1.297 and

3.969 respectively.

The reason for this modification was that our

procedures yielded estimates that replicated Lewis' series almost per—

fectly up to and including l957 but they diverged slightly for 1958.
The figures we use reflect the latest adjustments and corrections to the

data and so we are inclined to use our figures for 1958 over Lewis'.
The difference, however, is only slight.

Our series for 1957—80 are

given in columns (vii) and (viii) of Table G and they link up with
Lewis' series in columns (1) and (2) of his Table 59, page 211.

estate; services; government and government enterprises except the

time compensation was

computed from national income data by adding to

"wages and salaries per full—time equivalent employee" (Table 6.9B of

the National Income statistical tables) an estimate of supplementary
compensation per full—time equivalent employee. The latter, following

Lewis, was

calculated

by subtracting all annual wages and salaries

(Table 6.6B) from annual total compensation of employees (Table 6.5B)
and then dividing by the number of full—time equivalent employees each
year (Table 6.8B).

(In each case, the figures for the military were

subtracted from the entire government sector.)

Figures for sectors a

and b were calculated as fixed weighted averages of these industry
estimates where the weights are the industry's annual full—time equiva-

lent employment relative to the group's total full—time equivalent
employment over the entire period 1958—80.

(Note that these fixed

weights are not the same as Lewis' fixed weights which were the average

relative employment of each industry over the period 1929—57.)

The

series for the years 1958 to 1975 were taken from [Al below and the
series for the years 1976 to 1980 were taken from EmI below.

With

sector a and b compensation thus constructed, these series were linked

to Lewis' series in Table 5, page 2014, of his book. The series from
1958 to 1980 is given in columns (i) and (ii) of Table G.

Full-Time Hours Worked

Worker p Year

For each of the ten major industry divisions, annual full—time
hours worked per employee were calculated as the total number of hours

—67—

worked per year by full—time and part-time employees (Table 6.10 of the

National Income statistical tables) divided by the number of full—time
equivalent employees per year (Table 6.8B).

In each year the figures

for the military were subtracted from the government's sector.

The

sector averages were fixed weighted averages of the industry estimates
where the weights are the industry's annual full—time equivalent employ-

ment relative to the group's total full—time equivalent employment over

the entire period 1958—80.

The sources were !cl below for the years

1957—72, (A] (except for the government sector) for 19T3Tl4, (D] for

1975—78, and (B] (except for the government sector) for 1979 where
Table 6.12 provided the hours data. Hours worked and full—time equivalent employees for the military and for the entire government sector in

the years 1973 and 19714 were taken from the issues of the Survey of
Current Business for July 1977 and 1978 respectively. For the government sector in 1979, the hours worked of the military seems not to be

available in the regularly published series so for this year it was
inferred by assuming it was the same proportion of the hours worked in
the entire government sector as it was in 1978.

The sources cited do not provide data for 1980. For this year we
turned to the household data from the CPS which provides information on

average weekly hours worked (of those at work). We assumed that for
each industry the ratio of the Department of Commerce numbers to the CPS

numbers in 1979 remained the same in 1980 so, with the latter data
available in 1980, we can infer the corresponding Department of Commerce

figures for hours worked. The CPS data are published in Employment and

—68—

Earnings, January 1980 and January 1981 (Tables 31 and 32 in both
issues). Because data for mining are not supplied from the CPS, we used

the establishment data (Employment and Earnings, January 1982, Table 3,
page 198).

With the sector a and b hours worked per employee thus
constructed, these series were linked with Lewis' series in Table 56,
page 206, of his book.

The link was rrade with Lewis' observations on

average hours worked for 1957' not for 1958. That is, we replaced his
1958 indices of 1.088 for sector a and l.215 for sector b with 1.095 and

1.255 respectively. (In fact, our revised values for 1958 yield a ratio

of 0.873 which is virtually the same as Lewis' ratio of O.871.) The
reason for replacing Lewis' values with ours is that we have been able

to make use of revisions in the data series that presumably reflect
improvements in the underlying data.

Our series on hours worked are

listed in columns (iii) and (iv) of Table G.

TOtal

?.nhours Worked
For each industry division, total manhours worked is the product

of (a) full—time hours per year per full—time equivalent employee and
(b) the number of full—time equivalent employees. The construction of
(a) has already been discussed. Data on full—time equivalent employees

by industry is from Table 6.8B of [Al for 1957—76 and of [BI for
1977—80.

After each industry's total manhours worked figure is formed,

the sector figure is derived by summing over the constituent industry

are given in columns (v) and (vi) of Table G; these link up with those
given in columns (14) and (5) of Lewis' Table 59, page 211, of his book.

Ratio

of

Actual to Expected Price Level

The

national

index used for prices is the implicit price deflator for net
product available from Table T.6 of issues of the National

Income and Product Accounts. The series on "expected" prices is calcu—
lated in the same way as Lewis formed it, namely, as a weighted average
of current and past prices with weights declining exponentially from the

current date to earlier dates.

The ratio of actual to expected price

levels that we constructed is given in column (ix) of Table G and it
links up with Lewis' series in column (2) of Table 61, page 218, of his
book.

The series on the unemployment rate was taken from the Employment
