ABSTRACT
We explore the question of how political institutions and particularly democracy affect economic growth.
Although empirical evidence of a positive effect of democracy on economic performance in the aggregate
is weak, we provide evidence that democracy influences productivity growth in different sectors differently
and that this differential effect may be one of the reasons of the ambiguity of the aggregate results.
We provide evidence that political rights are conducive to growth in more advanced sectors of an economy,
while they do not matter or have a negative effect on growth in sectors far away from the technological
frontier. One channel of explanation goes through the beneficial effects of democracy and political
rights on the freedom of entry in markets. Overall, democracies tend to have much lower entry barriers
than autocracies, because political accountability reduces the protection of vested interests, and entry
in turn is known to be generally more growth-enhancing in sectors that are closer to the technological
frontier. We present empirical evidence that supports this entry explanation.

Introduction

There are two main open questions in the debate on the relationship between economic development and
democratic institutions. One is whether or not countries become democratic only at high levels of per capita
income, and the second is whether or not (or when) democracy enhances economic development, captured
by per capita GDP growth.
On both questions there are disagreements amongst scholars. Most observers would agree that richer
countries are democracies and therefore economic development favors transitions towards political freedom,
as argued by Lipset (1959) and Barro (1999). However, Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, and Yared (2005)
suggest that this cross-sectional evidence is not robust to controlling for factors aﬀecting simultaneously
income and political institutions. When they add country fixed eﬀects in repeated cross-country regressions
they find no eﬀect of the level of income on democracy. Admittedly this procedure looses all the information
arising from cross country comparisons, which seems crucial in this context. Huntington (1991) argues that
the progress towards democratization is not linear and there are back and forth waves of democratization.
On the second question the evidence is mixed at best1 . Perhaps democratic institutions increase redistributive pressures2 that may be harmful to growth, especially for middle income countries, and this is one of
the reasons why Barro (1996) argues that countries cannot become democracies too ”soon” in terms of their
level of income per capita. However, Mulligan, Sala-i-Martin and Gil (2003) do not find much of a diﬀerence
in public policies between democracy and non democracies, questioning therefore any link between form of
government and economic performance3 . Glaeser et al. (2004) also question the causal eﬀects of political
institutions on economic growth.
Very few studies address both questions jointly. Two exceptions are Przewroski et al. (2000) and de
Mesquita et al. (2003). Persson and Tabellini (2006) use the transition from democracies to dictatorship
and the concept of the accumulated stock of democratic capital, concluding that the latter is conducive to
growth and consolidation of democratic institutions at the same time4 . Giavazzi and Tabellini (2005) analyze

the timing of economic and political liberalizations.
In this paper we will focus mostly on the second question of whether or when democracy enhances
economic growth. Most of the existing papers on the subject employ aggregate data on income levels and
economic growth. A first point of departure of this paper is its use of disaggregated data to shed new
light on the debate. A second point of departure is the idea that political institutions, and democracy in
particular, may have diﬀerent eﬀects on diﬀerent sectors of the economy, possibly depending on the specific
characteristics of the technology and the industry’s market. Our results can be summarized in three points.
First, we find that democratic institutions and political rights enhance growth of more advanced sectors,
namely in sectors close to the technological frontier in the sense of Acemoglu, Aghion, and Zilibotti (2006).
Second we uncover that an important channel of this eﬀect is freedom of entry in markets. Political rights are
associated with freedom of entry and the latter is especially important for sectors close to the technological
frontier. In fact entry of new firms and competition are especially beneficial in spurring innovation at high
levels of technological development, whereas it may discourage innovation in more backward sectors as argued
by Aghion et al. (2006). Third, and this is an implication of the first two results, more advanced economies
benefit more from democratic institutions and therefore the demand for democracy should increase with the
level of per capita income in a country, calling into question, indirectly at least, the result by Acemoglu et
al. (2005) suggesting that development does not bring about democratic institutions.
That democracy may entails both, positive and negative eﬀects, on growth, has already been stressed
for example by Acemoglu (2007). There, higher democracy tends to be good for growth because it reduces
the extent to which existing oligarchies can prevent entry by potential competitors. On the other hand,
democracy leads to higher tax rates in equilibrium, which in turn tends to discourage innovation everything
else remaining equal. However, unlike in our analysis below, in Acemoglu (2007) the comparison between the
costs and benefits of democracy does not interact with the economy’s proximity to the world technological
frontier.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a model of democracy and entry which blends
the entry model of Aghion, Burgess, Redding, and Zilibotti (2006), henceforth ABRZ, with the model of
vested interests in Acemoglu, Aghion, and Zilibotti (2006), henceforth AAZ. Section 3 discusses the empirical
4

evidence. The last section concludes.

2

The model

The point of the model is to show that freedom of entry is especially growth enhancing in sectors closer to
the technological frontier. Freedom of entry is correlated with political rights, as we assume in the model
and we show below in the empirical part. Therefore the model derives the relationship between sectorial
growth and democratic institutions which we then test.

2.1

Production and profits

Time is discrete and all agents live for one period. One final good is produced competitively using a continuum
of intermediate inputs, indexed from 0 to 1, according to the following technology:
yt =

1
α

Z

0

1
α
A1−α
it xit di,

where xit is the quantity of intermediate input produced in sector i at date t, Ait is a productivity parameter
that measures the quality of the intermediate input i in producing the final good, and the parameter α ∈
(0, 1). The final good can be used either for consumption, or as an input in the process of production of
intermediate goods, or for investments in innovation. We normalize the price of the final good to one.
In each intermediate sector i only one firm (a monopolist) is active in each period, and produces intermediate input i using final output as input, one for one. Since the final good sector is competitive, the
intermediate monopolist i sells its intermediate good to the final good sector at a price equal to its marginal
cost. The first order condition for the final sector producers reads as follows:
pit = (Ait /xit )1−α .

(1)

Then profit maximization for intermediate-good producers yields the choice:

xit = Ait ( )− 1−α ,

and the equilibrium profit:
π it = δAit ,

where δ ≡ ( α1 − 1)( α1 )− 1−α .
Substituting for xit in the production function for final output, we also get:
yt = ζAt ,

(3)

where
At =

is the average productivity at date t and ζ = ( α1 )1− 1−α is a constant.

2.2

Entry and incumbent innovation

Let p denote the probability of a potential entrant appearing in any intermediate sector. In the model
the government directly chooses this parameter in a way described below. This is of course a short cut
that captures diﬀerent policies that may favor or hinder competition and entry. There are only two types
of intermediate firms: advanced firms, with productivity Ait = At , and backward firms with productivity
Ait = γ1 At , and we focus on technologically advanced entry; accordingly, each potential entrant arrives with
the leading-edge technology parameter At , which grows by the factor γ with certainty each period. An
advanced firm can use a first-mover advantage to block entry and retain his monopoly. But if the firm
is backward, then entry will occur, Bertrand competition will ensue, and the technologically dominated
incumbent will be eliminated and replaced by the entrant.
A new innovation costs cit Ait−1 and allows the innovating incumbent firm to improve productivity by
factor γ. We assume cit to be random and i.i.d. across intermediate sectors with support {0, c}, with
Pr(cit = 0) = Pr(cit = c) =

1
.
2

The eﬀect of entry threat p on incumbent innovation will depend on the marginal benefit vit which the
incumbent expects to receive from an innovation. Note that firms know their cost of innovation when they
decide whether to innovate (i.e. there’s no uncertainty).
Consider first an incumbent who was an advanced firm last period. If he innovates then he will remain on
the frontier, and hence will be immune to entry. His profit will then be δAt = δγAt−1 . If he fails to innovate
6

then with probability p he will be eliminated by entry and earn zero profit, while with probability 1 − p he
will survive as the incumbent earning a profit of δAt−1 . Dividing through by At−1 , an advanced firm with
innovation cost cit will innovate whenever
δ(γ − (1 − p)) = δ(γ − 1 + p) > cit .

(4)

In particular an increase in entry threat encourages this incumbent to innovate. Intuitively, a firm close to
the frontier responds to increased entry threat by innovating more in order to escape the threat.
Next consider an incumbent who was a backward firm last period, and who will therefore remain behind
the frontier even if he manages to innovate, since the frontier will also advance by the factor γ. For this
firm, profits will be zero if entry occurs, whether he innovates or not, because he cannot catch up with the
frontier. Thus it will innovate whenever:
δ (1 − p) (γ − 1) > cit .

(5)

where the left hand side is the profit gain from innovation that will be realized with probability (1 − p), the
probability that no potential entrant shows up. Thus in this case innovation incentives depend negatively
on the entry threat p. Intuitively, the firm that starts far behind the frontier is discouraged from innovating
as much by an increased entry threat because he is unable to prevent the entrant from destroying the value
of his innovation.
We assume that initially the entry rate p is equal to zero, and that
A1 : δ(γ − 1) < c,
so that, absent any entry threat, no firm with innovation cost equal to c ever innovates.
Using these assumptions, one can determine the steady-state fraction of advanced firms conditional upon
p = 0. Following ABRZ, suppose that an advanced firm that successfully innovates at date t, starts out in
period t + 1 as an advanced firm. All other firms start out as backward firms. Moreover, with exogenous
probability h, a backward firm at the end of period t is replaced by a new, advanced, firm at date t + 1. If
at denotes the fraction of advanced firms at t, then it satisfies the dynamic equation (see ABRZ):
at+1 = zA at + h (1 − zA at ) ,
7

where
zA = Pr(c = 0) =

1

is the probability that an advanced firm innovates if p = 0. Thus the steady-state fraction of advanced firms
is:
a∗ =

Politics and the equilibrium probability of entry

Suppose that entry policy, p, is determined each period by a politician that cares about the current consumption, but may also respond to bribes. Following AAZ, we assume that the politician’s pay-oﬀ is equal
to HAt−1 , where H > 0, if she chooses the policy that maximizes current output yt , and to Bt otherwise,
where Bt denotes the bribe that the politician may receive from private firms to limit entry. The parameter
H reflects the aggregate welfare concerns of politicians, or the eﬀectiveness of check-and-balances that the
political system imposes on politicians. It is our proxy for democracy in this model and we discuss this below.
To compute the equilibrium bribe incumbent firms are willing to pay to prevent moving from initial entry
probability p0 = 0 to p > 0, we need to compute the equilibrium payoﬀs for each type of firm (advanced or
backward) and for each cost realization cit = 0 or c, as a function of p.
Consider first an advanced firm. If this firm’s innovation cost is zero, then the firm will always innovate
and its post-innovation profit δγ Āt is independent of the entry probability. However, if the innovation cost
is c, this firm will lose from higher entry threat only if the threat p becomes suﬃciently high that condition
(4) holds. Then, indeed, the firm will lose the amount

Āt−1 [c − δ(γ − 1)]
which is positive by Assumption (A1). Thus the maximum bribe advanced firms would be ready to pay as
a whole to prevent an increase in entry threat from zero to p, is given by:
1
Ba (p) = Āt−1 a∗ [c − δ(γ − 1)].1(δ(γ−1+p)>c) ,
2

8

where

1
2

is the probability that cit = c and 1(δ(γ−1+p)>c) is equal to one whenever (4) holds and to zero

otherwise.5
Now, consider a backward firm. Such a firm will innovate if and only if c = 0 by Assumption (A1), no
matter the entry probability. And it will lose from a higher threat of entry, whether it innovates or not, just
because this reduces her probability of survival. The maximum bribe backward firms will be willing to pay
to prevent an increase in entry threat from zero to p, is equal to:
1
1 δp
Bb (p) = Āt−1 (1 − a∗ )[ δp +
],
2
2 γ
where the first (resp. second) term in the bracket is the expected loss incurred by backward firms with low
(resp. high) innovation cost6 .
Altogether, incumbent firms will successfully prevent the increase in entry threat from zero to p whenever
p is greater than p∗ such that:
B(p∗ ) = Ba (p∗ ) + Bb (p∗ ) = Āt−1 H.

(6)

Given that B(p) is strictly increasing in p, equation (6) defines the equilibrium entry probability p∗ as an
increasing function of H.
5 Indeed

the firm’s expected profit if the entry probability is p, is equal to
(δγ − c)At−1

whereas it is just
δAt−1
if the firm does not innovate. The diﬀerence between the latter and the former is just equal to
(c − δ(γ − 1))At−1 .

6A

backward firm’s ex ante expected profit is:
1
1
( δ(1 − p) + δγ(1 − p))At−1
2
2

whenever the entry probability is p.

2.4

Democracy, distance to frontier, and growth

The above analysis tells us that more democracy, as measured by a higher H, increases the probability
of entry. But this in turn, encourages innovation by advanced firms whereas it discourages innovation by
backward firms (from (4) and (5) above). The overall eﬀect on aggregate innovation and growth will then
depend upon the fraction of advanced firms a∗ in the economy, which also measures the economy’s proximity
to the world technology frontier: for a∗ suﬃciently close to one, the overall eﬀect of entry and therefore
democracy on innovation will be positive, whereas it will be negative if a∗ (i.e. h) is close to zero.

2.5

Main prediction and discussion

Combining (6) with (4) and (5), yields the prediction that an increase in "democracy" as measured by H,
will stimulate innovation by advanced firms but not by backward ones. One should thus expect a higher
impact of democracy on productivity growth in sectors that are closer to the world technological frontier.
We identify with democratic institutions the parameter H in our model. This parameter captures the
relative benefits of investing in a new technology relative to that of bribing a policy maker to make him
raise barrier to entry. Bribes are certainly not unknown in democracies, but since they are more open,
associated with more freedom of the press and involve alternation in power of diﬀerent groups, democratic
leaders are generally less likely to be permanently captured by incumbents. A diﬀerent way of interpreting
the evidence that we present below is to say that democracy enhance growth in technologically advanced
sectors when democracy is associated with policies that allow more competition and more freedom of entry.
In the empirical section which follows, we do indeed review evidence that imply a strong correlation between
freedom of entry and democratic institutions as measured by indicators of political rights.

Empirical analysis

3.1

Data

We use industry employment and value added data from the Industrial Statistics database collected by the
UNIDO (2005, revision 2).7 The data include 28 ISIC (level 3) manufacturing sectors at the three digit level
for 180 countries for the period 1963 to 2003. UNIDO is arguably the most comprehensive source of sectorial
data available in a cross-country-sector panel format8 . The UNIDO data provide the most extensive coverage
of developing countries sectorial output data available, a very important sub-sample for our study as most
of them are partially free or not free from a political standpoint. However, a drawback of this source is the
extensive use of national statistics, which tend to be especially noisy for industry-level data of developing
countries.
For our empirical analysis two are the key independent variables: democracy and the distance to the
technological frontier. In measuring the former we use standard, well-established measures of democracy in
political economics, such as the aggregate indicators from the Polity IV database (2005) and the Freedom
House measures of civil liberties and political rights. The Polity IV project records various regime characteristics for every independent state above half million total population. In particular we make use of the
combined polity index9 ranging from −10 to 10 (−10 = high autocracy; 10 = high democracy). Such index
incorporates more specific sub-indexes concerned with constraints on the executive, open political competition, eﬀectiveness of legislature, etc. The Freedom in the World data by Freedom House report annual
analysts’ assessments of both political dimensions10 and civil dimensions11 since 1972 for more than 192
7 Rajan

and Zingales (1998) is one of the early seminal papers employing sectorial growth rates analysis.

8 Other

well-recognized sources of country-sector panel include OECD and ILO. However UNIDO employs OECD data forthe

relevant subsample, while ILO produces employment data aggregated to the ISIC level-2, therefore more coarse than the data
we employ here.

freedoms of expression and belief; Be able to freely assemble and associate; Have access to an established and

11

countries. For the Political Rights and Civil Liberties indexes, respectively; 1 represents the most free and
7 the least free rating. For consistency we re-scale both indexes in order to have 7 as the most free rating.
As for distance to the technological frontier we consider the logarithm of the value added per worker
(V A/EM P ) of a sector divided by the maximum of the log of the same variable in the same sector across
all countries in each year and take one minus this ratio as a proxy for distance to frontier. Specifically we
define:
DIST AN CEict

= 1−

(V Aict /EM Pict )
maxc0 (V Aic0 t /EM Pic0 t )

i = industry; c = country; t = year.
We also substituted log value added per worker with the logarithm of output per worker in order to construct
an alternative measure of distance to frontier. We do not report results employing this variable, however, as
they tend to be similar.
Finally, we make use of measures of entry barriers and costs of entry estimates as constructed by Djankov
et al. (2002) and of real gross domestic product per capita in international dollars as reported in the Penn
World Tables, mark 6.2. Summary statistics for the sample are reported, classified by year, in the Appendix
Table A1.

3.2

Specification

On the left hand side of our regression we have the growth rate of either output (Y ), value added (V A)
or employment (EM P ) in the industrial sector. On the right hand side we have a measure of democracy
(and other measures of political/civil rights), a measure of distance to the technological frontier, and the
interaction term between the two. This term allows the marginal eﬀect of democracy to vary with the
proximity to the world’s most productive technology. We also include time and country-industry fixed
eﬀects in order to account for contemporaneous shifts in world growth rates and unobserved heterogeneity
across countries and industries. Thus, the empirical specification is as follows, where with yict we mean
either output, value added or employment in industry i of country c at time t:
right to hold private property.

s = {5, 10}
i = industry; c = country; t = year.
In the analysis we study 5-year and 10-years output, value added and employment sectorial growth rates.
We compute growth rates over non-overlapping periods and in particular 5-years growth rates are computed
over the periods 1970-75, 1975-80, 1980-85, 1985-90, 1990-95, and 1995-2000. For the 10-year growth rates
we use alternatively the 1975-85, 1985-95 (odd) years and the 1980-90, and 1990-2000 (even years). Given
the somewhat measurement-error prone nature of the data, we perceive this sample segmentation as a
conservative approach. By employing this segmentation approach we are able to exclude issues of mechanical
serial correlation present in a moving average setting. As we show below, indeed the results are sometimes
influenced by the specific assumptions on sample periods. In a series of results that we do not report we also
reestimate our main specification with yearly growth rates (s = 1). By and large the main implications of
our discussion hold for this sampling choice as well. However, the degree of measurement error is substantial
in UNIDO data at the yearly level, mostly because idiosyncrasies at the national statistical level are present,
and results tend to be sometimes (and expectably) sensitive in this respect. By employing growth rates over
longer periods of time signal to noise ratios tend to improve and ameliorate measurement error issues.
All the standard errors are robust and clustered at the country or country-industry level whenever
possible, in order to account for general variance-covariance structures at the country-industry level within
the panel setup. This approach is useful in order to address arbitrary forms of serial correlation in the error
terms by allowing general variance-covariance structures within any industry-country error term.
The set of controls that we systematically include in any industry-country regression, Xict , include the
level of real GDP per capita and its interaction with distance to frontier. The empirical model (7) is
13

essentially a reduced-form specification and we do not intend to over-emphasize any channel of causation. A
two-way causation mechanism is surely at work within a growth-democracy (or income-democracy) aggregate
specification. The aim of this paper is to emphasize a significant diﬀerential role in the correlation between
growth and democracy, this does not require the reader assigning causal interpretation to our finding.

3.3

Basic Results

Table 1 shows, in accordance to Acemoglu et al. (2005), that there is no eﬀect of democracy on growth
rates for manufacturing in a fixed-eﬀects regression at the country level (obtained aggregating the UNIDO
sectorial data at country-year level). If any, the eﬀect of democracy on growth appears to be negative, since
a few of the coeﬃcients in the various regressions are significantly negative (even though most coeﬃcients
on democracy are insignificantly diﬀerent from zero). Specifically, the upper panel (5-years growth rates)
presents a split picture between value added and employment growth rates regressions. In the notation for
this table (and the following ones) we employ the L j operator notation for j−years lagged values. The middle
panel (10-year growth for odd years) appears mostly positive and the lower panel (10-years even) presents
mostly negative coeﬃcients. These results are therefore consistent with what is found in the literature: no
robust eﬀects of democracy on aggregate growth.
Table 2 reports results on the eﬀect of democracy on growth at the country-industry disaggregated level.
The unit of observation becomes now a particular industry in a country at a specific moment in time. Still
no eﬀect of democracy is statistically or quantitatively significant in the data. Once again some of the
coeﬃcients of democracy (or political/civil rights) are negative and statistically diﬀerent from zero. This
table then shows that adding an extra dimension (industry level data) does not produce a departure from
standard fixed eﬀects country-level results per se. Notice that Table 2 introduces a control for the level of
real gross domestic product per capita. We include a control for income levels (and its interactions when
necessary) in order to partial out the eﬀects of political institutions and of the level of economic development.
Table 3 introduces in specification at the country-industry level (7) an interaction term between democracy and distance from the technological frontier. We report results concerning output, value added and
employment for all sample periods (5-year; the even and odd 10-year). This interaction matters statistically
14

and quantitatively in most specifications and enters with a negative and significant coeﬃcient. The table
shows that introducing a diﬀerential eﬀect of distance to the technological frontier and democracy explains
the data better in terms of fit. The sign of the interaction between distance to frontier and democracy
is usually negative, while the level of democracy is positive. The result indicates that when close to the
technological frontier, the eﬀect of democracy on growth is positive. However, far away from the technological frontier the eﬀect of democracy may be growth-diminishing. This can be interpreted as the basic
reduced-form implication of the theoretical model we built. Finally, we interpret the positive sign of the
coeﬃcient associated with the regressor DIST AN CE as evidence of convergence, a robust and recurrent
finding in the empirical economic growth literature. Notice also that a component of convergence is also
captured (predictably) by the level of GDP per capita which present a negative sign (growth rates are lower
in countries with higher levels of GDP per capita). The interaction term between GDP per capita and
distance to frontier is usually negative, although mostly insignificant.
Concerning quantitative implications of Table 3, let us begin from the first panel (5-year growth rates),
recalling that the Polity index ranges from −10 to +10, increasing in the level of democratic freedom. The
statistically and quantitatively significant results concern the value added and the employment growth regressions (columns 4-9) and the political rights and civil liberty indexes. In general output growth regressions
tend to appear more noisy and so do regressions employing the Polity IV index as a proxy for democracy in
the right-end side.
Column (5) implies that the eﬀect of an increase of a unit point on the Polity IV scale of democracy for
a sector that operates with the most advanced technology (i.e. distance from the frontier is 0) has the eﬀect
of increasing the growth rate of value added of 1.2 percent. However at the mean distance to frontier in the
sample (0.16) the eﬀect of a similar increase in democracy on the growth rate of value added decreases to −1
percent. Notice that this figure is roughly consistent with the results of Table 2. Considering a technology
half the productivity of the world frontier we would find a really substantial eﬀect of an increase of a Polity
IV unit of democracy: a drop of −5.7 percent. The unit measure for political rights and civil liberties is
diﬀerent from the Polity IV index, ranging from 1 to 7 (rescaled so that 7 indicates full democracy and 1
full autocracy). Once the coeﬃcients are scaled for the unit of measurement, the results employing Freedom
15

House data (columns 2 and 3) confirm the column (1)’s estimates.
Results systematically present more beneficial eﬀects of democracy when we use as left-hand-side variable
the sector’s employment growth. In column (8) the eﬀect of an increase of a unit point on the Polity IV scale
of democracy for a sector that operates with the most advanced technology (i.e. distance from the frontier
is 0) has the eﬀect of increasing the growth rate of value added of 3.9 percent. At the mean distance to
frontier the eﬀect of a similar increase in democracy on the growth rate of employment is −0.7 percent.
Considering the 10-year growth rates for both the even years and the odd years samples we maintain the
finding of a negative interaction term and a positive coeﬃcient on the level of democracy in the majority
of the specifications, albeit with some exceptions that we tend to attribute to the demanding nature of our
three-way fixed-eﬀects specification. The result confirm a positive role of democracy especially when close to
the technological frontier. Consider column (1) of the odd-years panel. The estimated eﬀects are consistent
with the 5-years growth rates but not statistically significant. Again the results on employment growth rates
are stronger.
Overall these results, including many other specification tests which we performed and are available upon
request12 , suggest that our intuition of a diﬀerential eﬀects of democracy in diﬀerent sectors as a function of
distance form the frontier is plausible. However, as the last part of Table 3 shows, some degree of sensitivity
of the results to certain specification or measurement issues remains evident.

3.4

Entry and Democracy

The previous section presents evidence of diﬀerential eﬀects of political institutions on sectorial performance,
depending on the specific characteristics of each industry. In this section we make some progress in the
investigation of a channel, especially focusing on entry barriers.
In the model of Section 2 we discussed the role of freedom of entry and we assumed a correlation between
freedom of entry and political freedom. In Appendix Table A2 we report evidence that democracies do
1 2 Among

the additional tests we performed are: change of sampling frequency (yearly panel results; modified dates for the

computation of the sample changes); specification changes (including quadratic terms of the democracy index); exclusion of
country or sector fixed eﬀects.

indeed have lower barriers and cost of entry by employing the Djankov et al. (2002) cross-country data on
regulation of entry. Indeed, a table similar to A2 is also present in the original Djankov et al. (2002) paper
and here it is reported only for completeness of the argument. The left-hand-side variable is a measure of the
cost of entry given by the number of bureaucratic procedures needed for a firm to enter the market (number
of procedures necessary to start up a business), available from the Doing Business project by the World
Bank. All measures of democratic development (constraints on the executives, political and civil rights, et
similar) present a negative correlation with entry costs, even controlling for income levels. Notice that in
addition to the Polity IV autocracy index and Freedom House political and civil rights indexes we also report
results employing all the additional measures of democracy and political liberties that Djankov et al. (2002)
employ, such as the Polity IV sub-indexes of executive de facto independence; constraints on executive power;
eﬀectiveness of legislature; government eﬀectiveness; competition in the legislative nominating process.
Perotti and Volpin (2006) study in detail the cross national determinants of investor protection and
entry. They present convincing evidence that "countries with more accountable political institutions have
better investor protection and lower entry costs". Note that , as they point out, poor investor protection
is indirectly a barrier for entry since new investors face higher risks in entering a new market. Perotti and
Volpin (2006) also use POLITY IV as a measure of political accountability but the experiment with several
others finding consistently a strong correlation between democracy and freedom of entry.
A direct way of relating our approach to past literature would be to consider the diﬀerential eﬀect of
democracy and entry using as a proxy for the probability of entry of a competitor the number of procedures
needed to start up a business in the country as reported by Djankov et. al. (2002). We could check if,
controlling for a diﬀerential eﬀect of entry, the role of democracy and the significance of the interaction term
change. Given the cross-sectional nature of the cost of entry variables only the interaction term between
entry cost and distance can be added to the specification of Table 3.
Although promising in principle, this approach did not yield any statistically relevant result in our
attempts. In tables available from the authors we considered this approach, with and without controls for
GDP levels. The estimates of the coeﬃcients on democracy and its interaction with distance seemed to be
unaﬀected by introducing this particular measure of entry costs interacted with distance. Considering the
17

5-year growth rate sample and the 10-year rates for both even and odd dates presents a noisy picture at
best: the marginal eﬀects of democracy at diﬀerent distances become somewhat smaller but the proxy for
entry is always insignificant and often with the wrong sign. This is also true if we add further interactions
on property rights protection, which we explored as well. The results on democracy and the interaction with
distance remain generally significant and with a positive and a negative sign respectively. These results taken
together suggest either that the Polity IV and Freedom House variables capture something more general than
the number of procedures regarding the possibility of entry and competition or that a purely cross-sectional
measure of cost of entry as the one proposed by Djankov et. al. (2002) does not present suﬃcient variation
to allow our three-way panel setup (industry-country-time, which is indeed fairly demanding in this respect)
to pick up any significant relationship with growth.
In order to provide a reasonable amount of variation in the data in Table 4 we replace the number of
procedures with the eﬀective level of entry in the sector, measured by the 5-year or 10-year growth rates in
the number of establishments. Notice that the growth rate in the number of establishment is a realized (ex
post) measure of entry and one could argue about whether or not is the relevant covariate to influence the
pattern of innovation discussed in the model, as opposed to ex ante proxies. Clearly a point in favor of our
approach is the scarcity of alternatives in terms of time-varying proxies of entry.
The time-varying entry variable allows to control for both the level of entry and its interaction with
distance to frontier. However, the UNIDO data do not include information on the number of establishments
before the eighties, therefore limiting the sample period for the analysis. In addition, casual inspection of the
original data indicates a somewhat more noisy nature of the establishment figures relative to employment and
value added figures, with somewhat large (abnormal) jumps (which we decide not to censor in the analysis).
The eﬀect of democracy is now reduced substantially. If we interpret eﬀective entry as a precise proxy
for entry costs, this finding tends to support our interpretation of the data. However, only for the 10year sample the marginal eﬀects of entry depend on the distance to frontier in a direction in line with the
model’s prediction. Entry in levels has a positive and significant eﬀect in all regressions and the interaction
with distance is instead negative. Statistically significant coeﬃcients on the interaction between entry and
distance are present for both sectorial output and value added. The eﬀect of democracy is generally negative
18

at the mean distance to frontier (0.16), but the coeﬃcients on democracy and its interaction with distance
are significant only in the case of political rights. This suggests that indeed an entry channel may explain
why democracy is conducive to growth in sectors closer to the technological frontier rather than other less
advanced sectors, at least over relatively long periods of time (10 years).

Conclusions

This paper investigates a diﬀerent approach and some novel empirical evidence on the relationship between
democracy, level of development, and economic growth by employing disaggregated data on industrial sectors’ growth rates. We have argued (and shown empirically with some degree of success) that democratic
institutions favor growth in sectors of the economy that are particularly advanced in terms of value added
per worker, or in our terminology, close to the world technological frontier. Our interpretation is that it is in
sectors close to the technological frontier that democracy is more beneficial, possibly through fostering entry,
competition, and innovation, which are relatively more important for growth in those sectors. Thus our
analysis introduces a technological motive for political freedom survival, a dimension that has not received
much attention in the wide empirical literature on democratization. It also suggests that the demand for
democracy should be higher in richer countries, that is in which more sectors are closer to the technological
frontier.
In a general sense this paper contributes to the strand of the politico-economic literature focusing on the
diﬀerential eﬀects of political institutions on economic outcomes. The same institutional features may have
quite diﬀerent eﬀects on diﬀerent components of the economy.
Natural next steps in this research program would be, first, to dig further into the various channels
whereby democracy fosters growth in more advanced sectors, and, second, to analyze the process by which
the economic demand for democracy may or may not translate into a real transition to democracy.
