ABSTRACT
Increases in the proportion of the working age population can yield a "demographic dividend" that
enhances the rate of economic growth. We estimate the parameters of an economic growth model
with a cross section of countries over the period 1960 to 1980 and investigate whether the inclusion
of age structure improves the model's forecasts for the period 1980 to 2000. We find that including
age structure improves the forecast, although there is evidence of parameter instability between periods
with an unexplained growth slowdown in the second period. We use the model to generate growth
forecasts for the period 2000 to 2020.

1: Introduction
During a demographic transition, falling death rates set off a population boom that
continues until fertility rates decline. In addition to its effect on population size, a transition can
have a sizable impact on the age structure of the population. Mortality rate reductions are
initially concentrated among young age groups, triggering a surge in the number of children and
the youth dependency rate. As this “baby boom” generation enters working age, and as falling
fertility rates reduce the total number of children, the ratio of working age population to total
population goes up. This increase reverses when the baby boom cohort ages and the old age
dependency ratio rises.
Changes in population age structure can have a large impact on economic performance
because labor supply and saving rates vary over the life cycle. Increased longevity may also
boost labor supply and saving rates. In addition, a decline in fertility increases female labor
supply (Bailey, 2006) and the resources available to invest in children’s health and education
(Joshi & Schultz, 2007). Several studies emphasize the role of shifting birth and death rates and
age structure in explaining cross-country variation in economic growth (Bloom & Canning,
2003; Bloom, Canning, & Malaney, 2000; Bloom, Canning, & Sevilla, 2003; Bloom & Freeman,
1988; Bloom & Williamson, 1998; Brander & Dowrick, 1994; Kelley & Schmidt, 1995).
This paper investigates whether age structure can be used to forecast long-run economic
growth. Such forecasts may be of interest in their own right or in the investigation of other
topics. For example, the problem of forecasting climate change has created a need for long-run
forecasts of economic growth because energy demand is highly income elastic; to be useful,

3

these economic growth forecasts have to be combined with projections of population, pollution,
and global warming (for example, see Nordhaus & Boyer, 2000). In addition to direct interest in
the forecasts produced by a model, the ability of a model to forecast can serve as a robustness
check, guarding against specification searches that over-fit models to existing data (Clements &
Hendry, 2005).
To forecast economic growth we adopt a reduced form conditional convergence
framework. Our main variable of interest is the average annual growth rate in real GDP per
capita (“growth” or “economic growth” hereafter). Starting with a structural model we derive a
reduced form in which growth over a period depends on factors at the beginning of the period,
including the initial level of income per capita. We estimate the model on data from the period
1960–1980 and use the estimated coefficients to predict economic growth in the period 1980–
2000. The specification for the growth model is taken from Sala-i-Martin, Doppelhofer, and
Miller (2004) who use Bayesian methods to find the variables with the highest posterior
probabilities (based on the data) of being required in a growth model; we add the log of the
initial ratio of working age to total population ("age structure") as an explanatory variable.
We show that economic growth models perform well in forecasting growth when
analyzing twenty-year periods; we also show that adding age structure to the growth model
significantly improves forecast accuracy. However, we find that all models tend to predict
higher growth for the period 1980–2000 than actually occurred. This prediction bias is due to a
worldwide slow down in economic growth in the period 1980–2000 not captured by the model.
There are a variety of approaches to forecasting economic growth. Fully specified
structural models (McKibbin & Wilcoxen, 1998) represent one extreme of the spectrum of
forecasting methodologies. Atheoretical models, where past trends are used to predict future

4

economic growth, exist at the other extreme (Kraay, 1999). Methods that fall between these
include reduced form models that incorporate a selected subset of contemporaneous and past
characteristics. Short-run forecasts of single-country growth rates using autoregression or vector
autoregression models are common (Brischetto & Voss, 2000; Clements & Hendry, 1998; Fair &
Shiller, 1990; Robertson & Tallman, 1999; Stock & Watson, 1998), but forecasts of crosscountry variation in economic growth have entered the literature only recently (Lee & Mason,
2006; Malmberg & Lindh, 2004; Prskawetz, Kögel, Sanderson, & Scherbov, 2004). Kraay
(1999) compares the forecasting performance of univariate time series models with that of crosssectional economic growth models for a panel of countries. For the forecast period 1990–1997,
he finds that the time series model is a better predictor of growth than forecasts based on a
growth model using information from the period 1960–1990, but that the reverse is true for the
forecast period 1980–1997. It appears that time series models may do well forecasting over a
short time horizon, but that the reduced form, conditional convergence growth models perform
better when forecasting over longer time horizons.
In the next section we discuss the data used and the forecasting method adopted for our
investigation. In section 3 we analyze the forecast performance of the different specifications
and present a formal comparison of the forecasting ability of each model. In section 4 we
present results for our preferred models of absolute and relative growth and decompose the
residual to identify the contributions to forecasting error of noise, parameter instability, and
estimation error. In section 5 we present out-of-sample forecasts of average annual growth rates
over the period 2000–2020. We conclude in section 6 with a summary and discussion.

2: Methodology and Data
Bloom, Canning, and Malaney (2000), Bloom, Canning, and Sevilla (2003), and Bloom
and Canning (2003) emphasize that labor supply and aggregate output are closely tied to the size
of the working age population. In this view, income per capita tends to be higher when the share
of working age people in the population is high. Taking income to be Y and population to be P
we can express income per capita as

Y
Y WA
=
P WA P

(1)

where WA is the number of working age people. We assume that the working age population
measures the workforce, which implies a constant participation rate. In fact, participation is not
constant, with female participation rates varying widely in developing countries and schooling
and early retirement depressing participation rates in developed economies. Taking logs

y = log

Y
Y
WA
, z = log
, w = log
P
WA
P

(2)

We assume that there is a steady state level of income working age person, z * , given by
z* = β x where the vector x consists of a set of variables that determines steady state income per
working age person. We can express the steady state level of income per capita y * as
y* = z * + w = β x + w

(3)

As in Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2003), economic growth occurs as each country converges from
its initial position to its steady state.2 Thus, we can derive
Δy = λ ( y * − y−1 ) = λ ( β x + w − y−1 )

2

(4)

This representation of the economic growth equation can be derived from the neoclassical Cobb-Douglas
production function and is used widely in empirical applications aimed to explain cross country differences in
economic growth. See for example Acemoglu & Johnson (2006), Bloom, Canning & Sevilla (2004), Dowrick and
Rogers (2002), Sachs and Warner (1997).

6

The steady state determines the long-run equilibrium and economic growth reflects
transitional dynamics. Let us suppose that we can write a structural model for the factors that
affect the long-run equilibrium as
x = α1 x−1 + α 2 w + α 3 y, w = γ 1 x + γ 2 w−1 + γ 3 y

(5)

Then we can derive the reduced form
Δy = λ ( y * − y−1 ) = δ1 x−1 + δ 2 w−1 + δ 3 y−1

(6)

where the reduced form coefficients δ are combinations of the structural coefficients from
equations (4) and (5). The advantage of the reduced form is that all of the variables on the righthand side of the equation are measured at the beginning of the growth period under
consideration. Thus, they are plausibly exogenous with respect to growth shocks.
We estimate an economic growth model of the type set out in equation (6) for the period
1960–1980, and then use the coefficient estimates to forecast economic growth in the period
1980–2000. This prompts consideration of the variables, in addition to the log working age
share w , that should be used to explain economic growth. Many variables have been suggested
as factors that can potentially affect economic growth.

Rather than propose our own

specification, we use the results of recent work by Sala-i-Martin, Doppelhofer, and Miller (2004)
(henceforth, SDM). They use a large set of potential explanatory variables for economic growth
and calculate the Bayesian posterior probability of each variable being included in the
specification, given a fixed model size. We focus on models with 5, 9, and 16 regressors, in each
case using the variables with the highest posterior rankings as shown in bold in Table 1 below.

Table 1 here: SDM Rankings

7

Although the posterior rankings of the variables differ across the 5, 9, and 16 regressor
specifications, smaller models are strict subsets of larger models. The rankings differ across the
different-sized specifications as some variables, like mining, require more “conditioning
variables in order to display its full importance” (Sala-i-Martin et al., 2004, p.831). Our main
variable of interest is the log of the working age share, which our theory above predicts will be
important for economic growth. We assume that the working age population measures the
workforce, which implies a constant participation rate, which as discussed above does not hold in
fact. Age structure has a mechanical effect on income per capita. It may also act a proxy for
other variables, such as work experience. Bloom, Canning, and Sevilla (2004) investigate the
effect of adding detailed data on age structure to a growth model to find if worker age, and work
experience, matter; however, they find little impact. SDM do not include the log of working age
share among their candidate variables, and instead include both the fraction of the population 15
and younger and the fraction of the population over 65. Neither of these variables performs well
according to the SDM selection criteria. Although it would be interesting to know how the log
of the working age share performs in a SDM-type analysis of the variables that best explain past
economic growth, our focus is somewhat different. We ask if the log of the working age share
can help predict future economic growth. We use the SDM analysis only to find a reasonable
specification for the rest of the growth regression.

We show that augmenting the SDM

specification with the log of the working age share improves forecasting ability.
We examine the ability of SDM models with 5, 9, and 16 regressors to forecast economic
growth and test whether the addition of age structure adds to the models’ forecasting
performances. For variables that do not change over time we use the same data as SDM. Time-

8

varying variables require more attention. SDM examine growth over the period 1960–1996.
Our growth periods are the periods 1960–1980 and 1980–2000, and we use data from 2000 to
forecast future economic growth.3 We measure our time-varying variables at 1960, 1980, and
2000 using the sources cited by SDM, or more up-to-date versions of these sources when
available. Values for real gross domestic product per capita, investment prices, and government
consumption share are from the Penn World Tables 6.2 (Heston, Summers, & Aten, 2006).
Educational attainment data are from Barro and Lee (2000), and data on life expectancy are from
the United Nations World Population Prospects (United Nations, 2004). We restrict our analysis
of the period 1960–2000 to those countries where all series of interest are available for the full
sample period, resulting in a balanced panel of 67 countries; we provide forecasts for the period
2000–2020 for all countries that have data for the year 2000. A full description of the variables
is included in the appendix. Summary statistics are provided in Table 2 and the correlation
matrix is displayed in Table 3 below.

3: Empirical Results

We start our empirical analysis by estimating each of the SDM models in the period
1960–1980 based on explanatory variables from 1960. Using the estimated coefficients, we then

3

Later we also undertake a pooled regression using a 10-year panel for 1960–1990 to forecast 1990–2000. This time
split also yields the same key result: the addition of the log of the working age share improves the forecast ability of
the model over specifications that only include the SDM-ranked variables. See Tables 12 and 13 for the forecast
error measure summary of this sample split.

forecast growth rates for the period 1980–2000 based on data from 1980 and the time invariant
variables. We compare the forecasts with the actual growth rates over the period. We estimate
five growth models. Our first two models provide a baseline: we start with a naive model where
we use growth in each country over the period 1960–1980 as the forecast for the period 1980–
2000. The second baseline model uses average growth across countries in the period 1960–1980
(SDM0) as the forecast for all countries in the period 1980–2000. We then estimate three
reduced form models, with 5 (SDM5), 9 (SDM9), and 16 (SDM16) explanatory variables
respectively. In each case the variables are shown in bold in Table 1.
Table 4 shows the results for the SDM specifications without the age structure variable.
Column 1 of Table 4 shows the results using a country’s growth for the period 1960–1980 as a
forecast for the period 1980–2000.

Column 2 of Table 4 provides details of the forecast

performance of a model in which growth during the period 1960–1980 depends on a constant
only. Columns 3, 4, and 5 show the results for the larger growth model specifications. Each
model is estimated using data from a sample of 67 countries for the period 1960–1980, with the
degrees of freedom declining as the number of explanatory variables increases. As expected, the
R2 in the estimation period (1960–1980) increases as the number of explanatory variables
increases, rising from zero (with a constant only) to 0.66 with 16 additional regressors.
However, the SDM9 model has the largest adjusted R2, which indicates that the additional
variables in SDM16 do not significantly improve the fit.
We use each of the models estimated over the period 1960–1980 to produce forecasts for
the period 1980–2000. There is a debate as to the best measure for assessing the goodness of fit
of forecasts (Ahlburg, 1992; Armstrong & Collopy, 1992; Clements & Hendry, 1998; Fair &
Shiller, 1990; Fildes, 1992; Hendry & Hubrich, 2006; Hyndman & Koehler, 2005). We assess

10

the forecasts using five measures: the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error
(MAE), Geometric Mean Relative Absolute Error (GMRAE), the Arithmetic Mean Relative
Absolute Error (AMRAE), and the Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE). These measures are
calculated as follows

where Δy j is the actual growth rate in country j, Δyˆ j is our forecast growth rate, Δy*j is a naive
forecast, and N is the number of countries. RMSE is the natural forecasting counterpart to
minimizing the residual sum of squares in fitting the model in the first period. However RMSE
is very sensitive to outliers and the mean absolute error (MAE) may be a more robust measure.
These measures have been criticized for being dependent on the unit of measurement. This is
mitigated in our case by noting that the growth rate at time t can be written as Δyt = log( yt / yt −1 )
and is therefore invariant to the scale used to measure income per capita. In addition, the
percentage-error measures proposed to overcome scale dependence are very sensitive to errors
when the actual outcome is close to zero, which occurs frequently in our data.
Another approach to measuring the accuracy of forecasts is to compare the goodness of
fit of the forecasts relative to the performance of a baseline naive forecast. This gives us the

11

relative forecast measures GMRAE and AMRAE.

These measures are averages (either

geometric or arithmetic) of each forecast error relative to the naive forecast. Note that these
averages can become very large if the naive model predicts one observation almost exactly
because it creates a number close to zero in the denominator. Our final measure is MASE, which
scales our forecast error by the average forecast error in the naive model and has a natural
metric: zero is perfect forecasting, less than one improves over the naive model, and greater than
one is worse than the naive model. For the naive forecast we use the simple extrapolation of the
last period’s growth rate for the country reported in column 1 of Table 4.
As shown in the middle section of the table, the forecasts of the model SDM5 with 5
explanatory variables outperforms the simple lagged forecast and constant forecast models on
most criteria. The only criterion on which it fails is AMRAE, where the lagged growth rate
appears to be a better forecast. This is because the naive forecast, lagged growth, is almost
exactly right for Chile. This produces a very large error relative to the lagged forecast for all our
other models, which dominates the arithmetic average. In what follows we focus on RMSE,
MAE, and MASE as our preferred measures of forecast error to avoid this problem. Note that
forecast performance on all measures worsens relative to SDM5 as further covariates are
included in SMD9 and SDM16.
We use three tests of model adequacy. The first is bias: we test whether the average
forecast error is different from zero. In our sample, the average annual growth rate fell from 2.7
percent during the period 1960–1980 to 1.3 percent during the period 1980–2000. None of our
forecasting models predicts this slowdown. Our preferred forecasting model SDM5, has a bias
of -1.1 percent per year, which is significant even at the one percent level.

12

The predictive efficiency test checks whether the slope of the relationship between
predicted and actual growth is significantly different from one. Failure of this test would suggest
that forecasts are systematically biased even when controlling for changes in the global
macroeconomic environment. We cannot reject the null hypothesis that the estimated slope
coefficient equals one for any SDM model. We do find a coefficient significantly less than one
for lagged growth. This suggests lagged growth contains both a permanent component that is
predictive, and a temporary component that does not help forecast.
The serial correlation test looks for a correlation between the residuals from the 1960–
1980 growth regression and the 1980–2000 forecast errors. A significant correlation would
suggest that the growth residuals from the period 1960–1980, which could be known in 1980,
would be useful in constructing forecasts, although our forecasting model does not use them.
One potential explanation for positive serial correlation is the presence of omitted variables that
affect economic growth but are fixed in each country over time. The presence of such fixed
effects could be addressed by the use of panel data forecasting methods as discussed in Baltagi
(2006).

For the naive SDM0 (constant only), we reject the null hypothesis of no serial

correlation, indicating that a country’s relative growth rate over the period 1960–1980 has
predictive power for the period 1980–2000.4 However, for each of the models with some
explanatory variables (SDM5, SDM9 and SDM16), we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no
serial correlation, indicating model adequacy with respect to this criterion.

Table 4 here: Absolute Growth SDM Only

4

Easterly et al. (1993) find little correlation between growth rates at 5 year intervals. For longer time intervals,
however, correlations between successive periods’ growth rates are higher.

13

To test the forecasting performance of age structure compared with that of the basic SDM
specifications, we repeat the previous regressions with the addition of the log of the working age
(aged 15–64) share of the total population, w. The results are summarized in Table 5 below.
Although there is little improvement in the fit of the regression in the period 1960–1980, the
inclusion of the working age share improves forecasting accuracy on a number of measures. In
our best performing model, SDM5, adding the log working age share improves the RMSE,
MAE, and MASE measures of forecast accuracy.

Table 5 here: Absolute Growth SDM plus Demographics

We test if this improvement in RMSE forecasting ability is statistically significant; the
results are shown in Table 6. We use the methodology suggested by (West, 2006). If we have
both the estimated gain in RMSE and the statistical distribution of the estimated gain under the
null due to sampling error, we can test the null hypothesis that the expected gain in average
squared forecast error is zero. Given the small sample size, we bootstrap the standard error to
calculate the critical values for this test.

We use 500 repetitions of the non-parametric

bootstrapping method with replacement to generate corresponding sampling distributions. Each
cell of Table 6 shows the average gain in RMSE when enlarging the model, and the p-value for a
test of the null hypothesis of zero gain. The test is one tailed, so that we reject only if there is a
significant increase in forecasting ability. Including age structure significantly improves the
RMSE in specifications SDM0, SDM5, and SDM9, although not in SDM16. Most important,
adding age structure significantly improves the SDM5 specification, our preferred model for
forecasting without age structure.

14

Table 6 here: Nested Model Comparison for Absolute Growth Models

Figure 1 here: Absolute Growth 1980–2000: Predicted and Actual

Figure 1 shows the actual growth rates for the period 1980–2000 and our forecasts using
SDM5 and the log working age share. Figure 1 shows that actual outcomes are systematically
below the forecasts, which is in line with the prediction bias reported in Tables 4 and 5. Growth
slowed around the world in the period 1980–2000 and our model fails to predict this. The failure
of cross-country growth models to predict the worldwide slowdown is not surprising. Such
models explain relative growth rates in a cross section of countries using country-specific
characteristics, while changes in the world growth rate over time are likely to be due to
worldwide shocks. For example, Hamilton (2003) examines the effect of oil price shocks on
macroeconomic performance and Easterly (2001) links the slow growth in the developing
countries after 1980 to slow growth in the developed world and high world interest rates. Crosscountry growth models lack these worldwide time series variables.
To avoid this problem we consider a forecast of relative economic growth. This shifts the
question from how fast each country will grow to how fast it will grow relative to the world
average; cross-country growth models seem better suited to this second question. We de-mean
each variable by subtracting the sample mean for that period. We use regression analysis to fit
relative growth rates over the period 1960–1980 using the de-meaned explanatory variables from
the same period. Accordingly, we take de-meaned variables from 1980 to forecast relative
growth over the period 1980–2000. This approach allows for a period-specific intercept that
changes arbitrarily between periods.

We leave open the question of what causes these

15

worldwide changes to growth rates. The results for relative growth forecasts with and without
age structure are summarized in Tables 7 and 8 below.

Table 7 here: Relative Growth Without Demographics

All the models shown in Table 7 perform better in predicting relative growth than in
predicting absolute growth, and the bias of the forecast is now zero by construction. The
hypotheses of model adequacy, prediction efficiency, and lack of serial correlation cannot be
rejected for any of the models that contain at least the SDM5 set of variables. In terms of
RMSE, MAE, and MASE, our preferred model is now SDM9.
Table 8 reports the results of the same relative growth regressions with the addition of
age structure. Adding age structure lowers the RSME, MAE, and MASE of the forecast in every
case. As shown in Table 9, these improvements in RMSE forecast accuracy are significant for
the SDM0, SDM5, and SDM9 models. Overall, the best performing forecasting model for
relative growth is SDM9 plus age structure. This model displays prediction efficiency and lack
of serial correlation and has the lowest RMSE among all our models.

Table 9 here: Relative Growth Models: Nested Model Comparison

The actual and predicted values for relative growth using SDM9 + w are plotted in Figure 2. The
plotted points tend to lie along the 45-degree line, showing prediction efficiency and no bias.

4: Error Decomposition

Although the predictions of our two preferred models (SDM5 + w for absolute growth
and SDM9 + w for relative growth) appear to satisfy our model adequacy criteria, the average
errors are considerable: the RMSE are 1.1 percent and 1.7 percent for relative and absolute
growth forecasts, respectively. From a theoretical viewpoint, assuming the data-generating
process is correctly specified, three main factors contribute to forecasting errors: random noise in
the data-generating process, parameter instability between the estimation and forecast period,
and imprecision in the coefficient estimation. Provided there is no covariance between these
sources of error we can decompose the variance of the growth forecasts as follows
)
)
V (Δy1 − β 0 x1 ) = V (Δy1 − β1 x1 ) + V ( β1 x1 − β 0 x1 ) + V ( β 0 x1 − β 0 x1 )

(10)

where we make a forecast in period 1 based on estimates from period 0. The first term on the
right-hand side of equation (10) is random noise, the second is the effect of parameter instability
over time, and the third is the effect of estimation error. We can estimate the size of the first two
error components by replacing the unknown parameter vectors β 0 and β1 with their estimated
values based on regressions for the two sub-periods. The third error component can be
calculated using the estimated variance-covariance matrix of the first period coefficient
estimates.
We can further decompose the first term, the forecast variance due to random noise, into
two parts: the expected noise based on the variance of the noise in the first period, and the
change in the variance of the noise term between the two periods.

17

Table 10 below shows the contribution of each of these factors to the actual RMSE
forecast error of our two preferred models. The mean squared error in annual average percentage
growth rate over the sample period is 1.71 percent for the absolute growth forecast based on the
SDM5 + w model, and 1.26 percent for the relative growth forecast based on the SDM9 + w
model.

For both models, random noise accounts for roughly half of the forecast error.

According to our estimates, total random noise slightly decreases in the second period for the
absolute growth variable, but remains fairly steady for relative growth.

Table 10 here: Error Decomposition

The effect of imprecise parameter estimates in the first period is very small, accounting
for less than 3 percent of total variance. The most important source of forecast error when
forecasting absolute growth rates is parameter instability across the two periods. However, for
relative growth the parameter instability effect is substantially smaller. This indicates that in the
absolute growth model parameter instability is largely due to a shift in the intercept across
periods.
Table 11 shows the estimated coefficients of our preferred models for the two subsamples (1960–1980 and 1980–2000), as well as for the full (pooled) sample for the period
1960–2000. An F-test of parameter stability rejects the null that the parameters are the same in
both sub-periods for both the relative and absolute growth models. For absolute growth, Wald
tests for each variable reject parameter equality between the two sub-periods at the 5 percent
significance level only for the intercept and the log of the working age share of the population.
In the case of relative growth, we reject parameter equality over the two periods only for the log
of the working age share.
18

Our age structure variable, the log of the working age proportion of the population, has a
small, statistically insignificant coefficient in the 1960–1980 estimation period, and a much
larger coefficient in the forecast period. It would have been difficult to justify putting age
structure into the model based on the 1960–1980 estimation. Ex post, we would have liked to
increase the estimated parameter tenfold for forecasting purposes although, as shown, even the
small estimated coefficient significantly improves the forecast. Our argument for including age
structure was primarily theoretical, suggesting that theoretical as well as “goodness of fit”
arguments should be considered in the construction of forecasting models.

Table 11 here: Coefficient Estimates in Sub-Samples

We have focused on 20-year periods for both estimation and forecasts. In Tables 12 and
13 we report forecasts of the relative growth model based on estimating for three 10-year time
periods between 1960 and 1990 and using these estimates to forecast for the period 1990–2000.
As before our preferred model in Table 12 is SDM9, which outperforms the other models in
terms of MAE and MASE (though SDM16 performs best in terms of RMSE).

Including Age Structure

5: Forecasts

We now use our preferred models to forecast future economic growth. Given the twentyyear horizon used in our analysis, the natural forecast period is 2000–2020. To generate these

19

forecasts, we use estimates from our preferred models of absolute (SDM5 + w) and relative
(SDM9 + w) growth over the pooled sample combining observations from the period 1960–1980
and the period 1980-2000. We then use the year 2000 values of the relevant explanatory
variables to forecast future growth. We forecast growth for all countries that have the relevant
data for 2000, even if they are not in the sample for the period 1960–2000. Table 14 displays the
growth rate for each country over the period 1980–2000 and both our absolute and relative
growth forecasts for the period 2000–2020. The absolute growth model predicts growth of 2.05
percent per year on average, and the model predicts positive growth rates for all countries. The
countries we expect to fare best in terms of absolute growth are China, South Korea, and the
Philippines5 (all of which are classified as East Asian by Sala-i-Martin et al. (2004)), with
forecasted average growth rates above 4.5 percent. The lowest growth rate is predicted for Mali,
followed by Guatemala and Niger.
Table 14 also shows our forecasts for relative growth. These forecasts are based on a
larger model (9 variables from SDM rather than 5 as in the absolute growth forecast) and make
no prediction on the world average growth rate over the period 2000–2020, which may be wise
given the past volatility of average growth. The ranking for the top three countries, China, South
Korea, and the Philippines stays the same. However the countries that have the worst forecast
when turning to relative growth are South Africa, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. This change results
from the inclusion of life expectancy in the SDM9 model we use for forecasting relative
economic growth. The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa has substantially reduced life
expectancy in these countries; their low life expectancies in 2000 lead to predictions of slow
economic growth in most of Sub-Saharan Africa over the next twenty years.
5

The high primary school enrollment in the Philippines, in addition to being classified as an East Asian country,
gives this country a high predicted growth rate. India, on the other hand, might be expected to perform well over the
next two decades, but has very low primary school enrollment and is not classified as East Asian.

6: Conclusion

By looking at forecasts of growth over the period 1980–2000 based on data from the
period 1960–1980, we are able to evaluate the forecasting ability of cross-sectional growth
models. We show that such models do have forecasting power, though larger growth models do
not necessarily perform better than smaller models in forecasting future economic growth. We
also show that the addition of age structure significantly improves the forecasts. Much of the
forecast error is due to parameter instability between periods. In particular, there is a downward
shift of the intercept term in the period 1980–2000, which causes actual outcomes to lie below
forecast growth on average.

Changing the focus to forecasting relative economic growth

(relative to the world average) improves the forecast considerably and removes this bias. We
provide forecasts of economic growth for a cross section of countries for the period 2000–2020
to allow ex post validation of our model.
Future studies of models for forecasting economic growth should consider how to
combine the cross-section approach used in this paper with time series methods that can forecast
movements in world growth rates over time. This will require exploitation of the full panelseries nature of the data. The nature of parameter instability should also be investigated, to
determine whether it reflects shifting parameters or is a symptom of deeper mis-specification.

PPP over investment / exchange rate in Current Prices. Current prices are for the
year 2000. Investment price in Uganda in 1980 is recorded as 1738.41, which
features as an outlier in that country series and affects the final results. We replace
the 1980 price of investment in Uganda with the 1981 price of investment to
address the outlier problem. Source: Heston et al. (2006)
We calculate the real government share of GDP using three series from the
PWT6.2 Current Government Share of GDP multiplied by the ratio of the price of
government share of GDP and the price of GDP (cg*pg/p). We choose not to use
the PWT6.2 Real Government Share of GDP as these series are imputed from the
current year, 2000, by multiplying the base year with the real growth rates of the
corresponding item of the national accounts. A further note on the PWT6.2 data
construction is that each price level has its own PPP measure, so the PPP over
government consumption, we denote as PPP(g), will differ from that over GDP,
PPP. As a result, the nominal government share, cg, is not a perfect measure of the
government consumption share as the numerator and denominator PPP will differ
given, cg = (G/PPP(g))/(GDP/PPP). By using our calculation we have the true
share of government consumption to GDP, G/GDP = cg*(pg/p) =
G/PPP(g))/(GDP/PPP)*((PPP(g)/XRAT)/PPP/XRAT)).
Thus we account for the different PPP measures used for GDP and government
consumption. Source: Heston et al. (2006), own calculations
As described the PWT6.2 Appendix, “RGDPL is obtained by adding up
consumption, investment, government and exports, and subtracting imports in any
given year…It is a fixed base index where the reference year is 2000, hence the
designation "L" for Laspeyeres.” Source: Heston et al. (2006)
Primary schooling in the initial periods (1960, 1980, 2000) is the proportion of the
population older than 15 who has at least some primary schooling. This data series
is generated by subtracting the proportion that has no schooling from the full
population. Source: Barro & Lee (2000)

E ( Δy − Δyˆ1 ) 2 − E ( Δy − Δyˆ 2 ) 2 = 0 by regressing the error squared difference on a constant. Reported coefficient

is the estimated constant, p-values of a one tail test for a positive coefficient are in parentheses. Standard errors (not reported)
were estimated using non-parametric bootstrapping method with replacement over 500 repetitions of the difference of the
expected residual squares regressed on a constant.
