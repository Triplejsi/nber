ABSTRACT
In early 2003, France actively tried to thwart the plans of the Bush administration to build international
support for a war to depose Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein. In response, calls in the United States for
a boycott of French products, wine in particular, rebounded through all forms of media. In the spring
of 2003, French business people even reported that the boycott calls were hurting their U.S. sales.
Using a dataset of sales of nearly 4,700 individual wine brands, we show that there actually was no
boycott effect. Rather, sales of French wine dipped for two reasons. First, they experience a cyclical
peak at holiday time, from November through early January, and the boycott was called during the
February to May period. Second, sales of French wine have been in a secular decline in the United
States. Sales in February through May 2003 merely stayed on trend. We contrast our results with other
recent work that has found evidence of a boycott effect but that omits the holiday effect from several
specifications. French wine producers may be having economic problems, but it is not because of their
government's foreign policy.

Abstract
In early 2003, France actively tried to thwart the plans of the Bush administration to build
international support for a war to depose Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein. In response, calls in the
United States for a boycott of French products, wine in particular, rebounded through all forms
of media. In the spring of 2003, French business people even reported that the boycott calls were
hurting their U.S. sales. Using a dataset of sales of nearly 4,700 individual wine brands, we
show that there actually was no boycott effect. Rather, sales of French wine dipped for two
reasons. First, they experience a cyclical peak at holiday time, from November through early
January, and the boycott was called during the February to May period. Second, sales of French
wine have been in a secular decline in the United States. Sales in February through May 2003
merely stayed on trend. We contrast our results with other recent work that has found evidence
of a boycott effect but that omits the holiday effect from several specifications. French wine
producers may be having economic problems, but it is not because of their government’s foreign
policy. (JEL classification: D12, F14, L66, Q17)

I. Introduction
Pressures to change consumer tastes and purchasing behavior abound. Some come from
market participants, such as producers and merchants who engage in advertising and marketing
campaigns. But nonmarket participants are also prominent, in particular the politicians and
activists who encourage consumer boycotts for particular causes. Boycotts are alleged to have
helped migrant farm workers in California gain increased pay and to have helped end the

apartheid regime in South Africa. They have been declared against French products following a
resumption of nuclear testing in the 1990s, and most recently they were declared by part of the
Muslim world against Danish products several months after the publication of cartoons of the
prophet Muhammad in a Danish newspaper.

Calls for a boycott can have one of three effects. Consumers can honor the boycott,
leading to a decline in sales of the product being boycotted. They can ignore the boycott, leading
to no change in sales. Or, expressing opposition to the goals of the boycott, they can increase
their purchases, leading to increases in sales. In fact, this latter effect is alleged to have occurred
regarding the boycott of Danish products in 2006 (Hitchens, 2006). Thus, the aggregate effect is
an entirely empirical matter.

This paper studies the boycott issue by investigating U.S. consumer behavior during the
run-up, major combat, and immediate post-combat lull of the Iraq War that started in 2003.
France proved a tenacious opponent to U.S. plans to marshal a multinational force to invade Iraq
and depose its dictator, Saddam Hussein, and calls for a boycott of French wine and other
products rebounded throughout the United States. Emotions ran high. Taking a cue from the
bandits of the Mexican mountains who eschewed government-sanctioned, peace-officer
identification (Traven, 1934), one boycotter proclaimed on national television, “We don’t need
your stinking wine” (Lou Dobbs Moneyline, 2003b).

We find that at first glance, the calls for a boycott did lead to a decline in French wine
sales in the United States. However, at the time of the boycott, French wine sales had already

2

been declining over a longer period, and just before the boycott period, sales of French wine had
experienced a seasonal holiday peak. When the secular decline and seasonal effects are
accounted for, there is no boycott effect. Our work builds on the previous work of Vannerson
(2004) by using microdata on wine sales for nearly 4,700 brands in the United States and
studying the effects of the boycott on the revenue share of French wine, the quantity share, the
quantity, and the price. Our results differ from those of Chavis and Leslie (2006), and we
explain those differences below.

In the next section, we review recent work on the French boycott. The subsequent
section presents the key results using the microdata, and the section following contrasts this work
with the opposite results found by Chavis and Leslie. A final section draws conclusions.

II. Recent Work on the French Boycott of 2003
The U.S. boycott of French wine was not the first faced by the French. In 1995, after the
French military announced a series of nuclear tests in the South Pacific, Denmark embarked on a
boycott of French products. There appears to have been remarkable unanimity. All Danish
political parties signed a protest letter to the French government, and a Danish minister wrote a
letter to his French counterpart, on behalf of the Danish government, to try to stop the tests. In
addition, a major Danish retail chain stopped marketing French products and was joined by other
Danish retailers.

Bentzen and Smith (2001) find a boycott effect at the end of 1995 and the beginning of 1996,
even after taking account of seasonal components and a trend decline in the market share of

3

French wine. They also find a possible longer-run effect through 1998. However, they do not
reject the existence of price effects during 1995 and 1996.

The political situation in the United States in 2003 was quite different from that in Denmark in
1995 and 1996. Unlike in the Danish case, the United States was not united in its interest in
punishing the French for their opposition to the Iraq War. Rather, the country was deeply
divided over the policy, and therefore many people not only saw no need to punish the French,
but rather saw buying French products as an opportunity to praise the French for their opposition
to the proposed war.

Vannerson (2004) provided one of the first, if not the first, analyses regarding the U.S.
boycott of French wines in 2003 by testing the following model

Wt = α + β1 Bt + β 2 H t + β 3Tt + ε t

(1)

In the equation, W is the revenue share of French wine sales in the United States, in percentage
points, B is a dummy for the boycott period, H is a seasonal dummy for the holiday period, and T
is a time trend. These are explained below.
The data are gathered from scanners in high volume supermarket chains in 64 major U.S.
markets, and were provided by Information Resources, Inc. (IRI). They include dollar sales and
prices organized by country of origin, type of wine (table, dessert, and fortified, for example),
label information, and the market where sold. They run in 22 four-week blocks from September
10, 2001, through May 18, 2003.

4

The data exclude wine sold in restaurants and wine specialty shops, a flaw because these
are the venues where higher-end wines are sold more frequently, and the French have a stronger
position in the high end. If anything, this should bias results in favor of finding a boycott effect.
The use of supermarket scanner data also results in under-representation of states where
supermarket sales of wines are limited or forbidden, in particular Massachusetts, New York,
New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, although Massachusetts allows supermarket sales of alcohol in a
restricted set of stores. Nonetheless, the data provide a consistent, accurate, and comprehensive
account of most wine sold in the United States. Descriptive statistics are shown in Appendix
Table 1.
Vannerson identified the boycott period as extending from February 2003 through May
2003, specifically January 27 through May 18. In his first test, he compared sales during that
period to sales during the previous four four-week periods and found that sales in the boycott
period were 0.56 percentage points lower—2.55 percent compared to 3.11 percent—a
statistically significant difference (top of Table 1). The same holds true when all 22 periods are
included (Table 1, column 2, a specification not in the original paper). The French revenue share
in the boycott period was lower on average than in the previous 18 four-week periods.

Table 1 about here

However, French wine sales ordinarily increase in November, December, and January, a
significant holiday period in the United States. To account for this, Vannerson added a holiday
dummy for the three four-week periods from November 5, 2001, through January 27, 2002, and
the three four-week periods from November 4, 2002, through January 26, 2003. In addition,

5

French wine sales were trending downwards even before the boycott, so Vannerson added a time
trend. Taking these two patterns into account, there is actually no boycott effect (Table 1, final
column). The decrease in French revenue share of wine sales in the United States during the first
part of 2003 resulted from the end of the cyclical holiday peak and the secular decline of sales of
French wine.

This basic insight is robust to other measures of French wine sales. It may have been the case
that fewer bottles of French wine were purchased during the boycott period, but that they were
more expensive on average, leading to no effect on revenue share. Regressions using French
quantity share as a dependent variable indicate that without a holiday indicator and a time trend
the boycott appears to have been effective. However, when these are included, once again the
estimated boycott coefficient becomes statistically insignificant (bottom of Table 1). This
suggests that there was no boycott effect on the quantity of French wine sold in the United
States.

In contrast, Chavis and Leslie (2006) do find a boycott effect, in particular, in their preferred
specification, a 13 percent decline in U.S. sales of French wine over the first six months after the
start of the war with Iraq. They use weekly microdata from IRI on prices and quantities by
product and country of origin for December 2001 to November 2003 for wine sales in
supermarkets and other general merchandise stores in four markets—Boston, Houston, Los
Angeles, and San Diego. Although their data are weekly, they have the same disadvantages as
the Vannerson database along with the added disadvantage of potentially being unrepresentative

6

of the U.S. market as a whole. In addition, one of the markets, Boston, is severely
underrepresented because wine sales there take place in supermarkets only on a limited basis.

There are other differences as well. Most important, using the same dummy variable approach
as Vannerson, they define the boycott period as the first eight weeks after the start of the war, or
March 17, 2003, through May 11, 2003. They then study the effects of the boycott on quantities
and prices of French wine sold. In each specification, the boycott effect is negative and
statistically significant. They also conduct the analysis using non-linear least squares and find
similar results.

III. New Results on the U.S. Boycott
We build on the Vannerson paper by exploiting the microstructure of the IRI data.
Nearly 4,700 brands of wine were sold throughout the United States from October 2001 through
May 2003. Of these, 923 were French. Using these microdata provides a richer dataset, allows
us to gain more precise estimates of coefficients, and reduces the possibility of aggregation bias
that might arise from summing sales of all French wines. We test variations of the following
relationship, an expanded version of equation (1).

Wijt = α + β1 Bt + β 2 H t + β 3T jt + β 4 N i + β 5 M t + ε ijt

(2)

W is some measure of wine sales—revenue share, natural log of quantity, quantity share, or
natural log of price—for each wine i from each country of origin j in each of 22 four-week time
periods t. B is a dummy variable for the boycott period, the four four-week periods starting
January 27, 2003, and is included only for observations on French wines. H is a dummy for the
holiday period, the three four-week periods starting November 5, 2001, and the three four-week

7

periods starting November 4, 2002, and again is included only for observations on French wines.
Following Chavis and Leslie (2006) and analogous to Vannerson (2004), T is an origin-specific
time trend for each country or region of origin of the wine (Vannerson tests French revenue share
but does not include separate observations by country of origin and therefore uses one time trend
rather than origin-specific time trends).

Among the other variables in equation (2), N is a wine-specific dummy, allowing us to
remove a significant amount of unobserved heterogeneity, such as label aesthetics, the public’s
perception of specific brands, and even general price level of the wine (although we do test a
specification with price explicitly entered as an explanatory variable). M is a month-specific
dummy for each four-week period, and ε is an error term. Origin countries and regions include
Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, California, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Greece,
Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, Mexico, Morocco, Netherlands, New York, New
Zealand, Oregon and Washington, Portugal, Romania, Russia, South Africa, South America,
Spain, and Yugoslavia.

Columns 1 and 2 of Table 2 show the key results. Only coefficients for the boycott dummy are
shown. Column 1 is comparable to Table 1, column 1, in which no holiday dummy or time trend
is included. The results seem to provide strong evidence of a boycott effect, although smaller
than that indicated in Table 1 when measured at the mean revenue share. In Table 1, the boycott
reduced the French revenue share by almost 20 percent (0.56 divided by 2.83), but in Table 2 it
reduced the French brand-specific revenue share by only 3 percent (0.659 divided by 21.31; all
revenue shares are multiplied by 100,000). At the median, however, the size of the effect is the

8

opposite. In Table 1, the boycott reduced the French revenue share by the same 20 percent (0.56
divided by 2.85), but in Table 2 it reduced the French brand-specific revenue share by almost
1,000 percent (0.659 divided by 0.061).

Table 2 about here

Results for quantity and quantity shares as dependent variables similarly indicate a
boycott effect, and all are statistically significant at the 1 percent level. However, these results
do not take account of the special holiday effect experienced by French wine or the secular
decline in sales of French wine. In fact, many varieties of Champagne could have experienced
dramatic decreases in the late winter and early spring, having been bought in December for New
Year and then not purchased again until a year later.

When holiday and trend effects are included, the boycott effect disappears (column 2). In all
cases—the revenue share of each brand, the quantity of each brand, and the quantity share of
each brand—sales are unaffected by the boycott. In fact, the point estimates for the effect of the
boycott on revenue share and quantity share actually are positive, although these coefficients are
not statistically significant.

In their paper, Chavis and Leslie try specifications in which they include only brands that have
strictly positive sales in their boycott and comparison periods. We follow their lead in columns 3
through 6, including all brands that have strictly positive sales in all periods in the regressions.
In Appendix Table 2 we show the same results when all observations with strictly positive sales

9

are included, even though observations for those same brands may have zero sales in some
months, rather than the Table 2 regressions of only brands with strictly positive sales over the
entire period of analysis.
The results confirm the basic findings. In most cases without the holiday dummy or the
time trend, the boycott appears to have affected sales of French wines in the United States.
Oddly, the boycott appears to be related to increased price, which Chavis and Leslie also found.
However, in every case with the holiday dummy and time trend included, there is no boycott
effect, except in the case of quantities, and here the boycott is related to an increase in the
quantity of French wine bought.
Although the results are similar to those using the full dataset, we do not agree that the
observations with zero sales should be omitted. Chavis and Leslie justify this by noting that zero
sales in any one period might result from stocking decisions of retailers or distributors, rather
than consumers’ choices. However, zero sales might also result from consumers’ choices, and
thus including them provides valuable information. Furthermore, if brands were being withheld,
the number of brands with zero sales should be higher during the boycott period compared to
earlier periods. However, this was not the case. For all of the 22 periods, the number of French
brands with zero sales ranged from 504 to 518, with the median 510.5 (the average of 510 for the
11th observation and 511 for the 12th observation when ranked from low to high). French brands
with zero sales during the boycott period totaled 509 (period 22), 510 (period 21), 511 (period
20), and 514 (period 19). The number of brands with zero sales actually decreased during the
boycott period, hardly evidence of negative stocking decisions by distributors or retailers.

10

IV. Boycott Effects and the Boycott Period
One other important difference between the analysis so far and that of Chavis and Leslie
is the designated boycott period. They use two methods. In the first, they limit the boycott
period to the first eight weeks after the start of the war. President George W. Bush delivered an
ultimatum on March 17, 2003, that Saddam Hussein and his sons had 48 hours to leave Iraq.
The war, dubbed Operation Iraqi Freedom, began on March 20 with an air strike on Saddam
Hussein’s compound (Airman, 2003). Because their data are weekly, Chavis and Leslie
designate the boycott period as March 17 through May 11.

In their second method, a nonlinear specification, they use newspaper reports of the
boycott and discussions of the boycott by Bill O’Reilly on The O’Reilly Factor, a Fox News
show, as a proxy for calls for the boycott. This method does not assume a boycott period, but
instead yields an estimate of how long a boycott lasted. In this method, they include a holiday
dummy, although in their linear specification they do not. We do not address their nonlinear
specification further.

How long was the boycott period? Available evidence indicates that it started in midFebruary and was in full swing by mid-March, a period omitted from the Chavis and Leslie
analysis. The peak moments of tension may well have occurred in early March. On March 5,
France and Russia, which both hold veto power in the United Nations Security Council, and
Germany announced that they would not allow a United Nations Security Council resolution
authorizing the use of force against Iraq (The New York Times, 2003). French Foreign Minister
Dominique de Villepin reiterated this on March 7, backed up by Russia and China, which also

11

holds veto power (Barringer, 2003). And on March 10 in Paris, French President Jacques Chirac
announced that France would veto a United Nations resolution authorizing the use of force,
“whatever the circumstances” (Sciolino, 2003).

To further explore the timing of the boycott, we conducted a Nexis search using the string
“wine AND boycott” for major newspapers and transcripts during the period November 1, 2002,
to June 30, 2003. Lists of media included in these groups appear in Appendix Table 4. In both
cases, we excluded all non-U.S. sources. As an aside, we note that the first time the term
“freedom fries” appeared as a substitute for “French fries” in a major newspaper was February
20, 2003 (Kiely, 2003) and the first time it appeared in a transcript was February 17, 2003 (Syler,
2003).
The pattern from both sources is clear. Between November 2002 and June 2003, wine
and boycott in the context of a boycott of French goods were mentioned in 187 newspaper
articles or editorials. None of these mentions occurred in November, December, or January.
The first mention occurred on February 13 in The Boston Herald (Gatlin, 2003). There were 23
articles in February, 80 in March, 54 in April, 20 in May, and only 10 in June.

Likewise, between November 2002 and June 2003, wine and boycott were mentioned in
173 transcripts in relation to France and the Iraq war. In November, December, and January,
there were no references to wine and boycott related to France. In February, there were 49, and
this rose to 65 in March. The number fell to 40 in April, 16 in May, and only three in June. Bill
O’Reilly first mentioned the boycott on February 24. Although hardly scientific, these numbers

12

suggest the boycott was on the public’s mind in February and that talk of the boycott peaked in
March.
The content of these articles and transcripts also suggests the boycott started well before
the start of the Iraq War. As early as February 13, it was announced that U.S. House of
Representatives Speaker Dennis Hastert wanted to put orange labels on French wine (Lou Dobbs
Moneyline, 2003a). Larry Gatlin in the Boston Herald on the same day wrote about the reactions
of wine and food merchants to a consumer backlash that had supposedly already started. On
February 26, it was reported that Pennsylvania State Representative Stephen Barrar was
proposing a resolution that would ask the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board to boycott French
wine and liquor (KYW-TV Eyewitness News, 2003).

To further measure the potential for boycott action, we searched a nonrandom set of
popular warbloggers, the usually libertarian or conservative but sometimes liberal webloggers
who supported the war effort. An important mention can be found on Instapundit.com, authored
by University of Tennessee Law Professor Glenn Reynolds, known by some as the blogfather
because of his high web traffic and sizable influence among bloggers. On February 10, 2003, he
reported hearing from one reader that perhaps the time to start boycotting French products had
arrived, and he announced that he “had already started buying Australian, Argentine and Chilean
wines in preference to the French wines.” On February 11, the message was a little saltier. One
reader from Dayton, Ohio, wrote that he was about to buy a bottle of French wine when a man
next to him “looking at the same wine said, ‘[expletive deleted] the French, I wouldn’t drink it if
it were free!’ and picked up another bottle of wine, Aussie I think, glared at me and walked

13

away. I thought to myself, ‘yep, me too pal, with barbed wire’ and grabbed an Aussie bottle
myself” (Instapundit.com, 2003).
Indeed, that specific post led Australian wag Tim Blair, then a columnist for The Bulletin,
an Australian newspaper, and an independent blogger (TimBlair.net), to encourage Australian
wineries on February 19 to move quickly into the newfound opportunity. “Attention, Australian
wine exporters: the marketing opportunity of the century presents itself in the United States,” he
wrote, “where French and German weasel wines are now shunned” (Blair, 2003).
Other blogs show similar evidence of boycott action before the start of the Iraq War. On
March 6, proprietor Charles Johnson of the popular Little Green Footballs blog passed along an
announcement for a demonstration to take place in Los Angeles in which people were to dump
bottles of French wine in the gutter (Little Green Footballs, 2003). In fact, by March 26, Jeff
Jarvis, author of the Buzz Machine blog, declared the boycott passé: “I see that NewsMax is not
only spamming us with Boycott France popunder ads, they’re now placing Boycott France ads in
at least the New York Times. That fight is so old already it’s out. France is so… so… pre-war”
(Jarvis, 2003).
Despite that, we now investigate sales of French wine in the United States as if the
boycott started after the beginning of the Iraq War and lasted only two months. To start, we
repeat the regressions of Table 1 but designate the boycott period as March 24 to May 18, the
closest we can come to the Chavis and Leslie period of March 17 to May 11 (Table 3). As
expected, without a holiday dummy or a time trend, the estimate of the boycott effect is negative
and statistically significant. However, in contrast to the results using a four-month boycott
period, when the holiday dummy and time trends are added, the boycott effect remains negative
and statistically significant, as Chavis and Leslie found.

14

Table 3 about here

This may actually be a boycott effect, but not quite the way the boycotters intended.
When the boycott dummy is omitted from the regression, but the holiday dummy and the time
trend are included, actual purchases for the period January 27 to February 23 are well above their
predicted value, the largest underprediction for all 22 observations (Figure 1). There is evidence
that this was also a time when people were actually overpurchasing French wines to protest
against the boycott and the proposed war. A posting on Gawker, a popular Manhattan media
news and gossip web site and part of Nick Denton’s Gawker Media empire, mentioned an antiwar protest on February 15: “I’ll probably protest the war by staying indoors and consuming
French products, but should you decide to brave the cold, here’s a map and logistics guide”
(Gawker, 2003). It appears that people might have shifted their purchases to February, with a
corresponding drop in purchases in April and May.

Figure 1 about here

In fact, when we separate all four potential boycott periods, the four-week periods from
January 27 to May 18, 2003, we find this is exactly what happened (Table 4). Without the
holiday dummy and time trend, coefficients for the last three four-week boycott periods are
negative and statistically significant when the French revenue share during these periods is
compared to that of the four four-month periods running from October 7, 2002, to January 26,
2003 (column 1). Furthermore, the coefficients for the last two four-week boycott periods are

15

negative and significant when all 22 four-week periods are included (column 2). However, when
the holiday dummy and time trend variables are included in the full 22-observation specification,
the boycott effect for the period January 27 to February 23 is large and positive, as suggested by
the residual plot of Figure 1, although significant at only the 10 percent level. Boycott effects for
the final two periods, March 24 to April 20 and April 21 to May 18, are negative but not
statistically significant at all.
Table 4 and Table 5 about here

Finally, we subject the full brand-level dataset to the analysis using only a two-month
boycott period (Table 5). We use a specification as close as possible to that of Chavis and
Leslie, omitting the holiday dummy from column 2 (it is included in Table 2, column 2). Even
without the holiday dummy, but with the time trend, when all observations are included,
including those with zero values, the boycott effect is not significant (column 2). The effect on
revenue share is negative, but with a t-statistic of -1.04 and a p-value of 0.3. The effect on
quantity is positive, but it is negative on quantity share, and in neither specification is it
statistically significant.
Columns 3 through 6 show the same results with only brands that have positive sales in
all periods, for purposes of comparison with Chavis and Leslie (regressions when all
observations with strictly positive sales are included, even though observations for those same
brands may have zero sales in some months, are shown in Appendix Table 3). Results are again
similar to those of Table 2, with one important exception. The regression of revenue share with
origin-specific time trends shows a negative and large boycott effect (column 5). Although this
is significant at only the 10 percent level, it is troubling.

However, there is one factor missing. As noted previously, French wines experience a
seasonal holiday sales increase, and the regressions in columns 1 through 5 in this table do not
include an indicator for the holiday period. When that indicator is added, in column 6, the
estimate of the boycott effect decreases in magnitude and becomes statistically insignificant.
There is no boycott effect, even when the boycott period is designated as March 24 to May 18,
the two months after the start of the Iraq War.

V. Conclusion
On April 16, 2003, the same day that General Tommy Franks, commander of U.S.
Central Command, entered Baghdad, the Washington Post reported that the boycott was having a
painful effect on the French. “American importers of French wine are reporting sharp drops in
sales in the past two months, and other French products also have been affected. The [French]
Federation of Wine Exporters has called a meeting Thursday to discuss how to respond”
(McCartney, 2003).

The data simply do not support this conclusion, however. There is no evidence that at the
retail level, American consumers as a whole turned their backs on French wines at a faster rate
than they had already been turning them. There were even news reports around the same time
that the boycott had not affected sales:
In fact, many of the anti-France movements have barely caused a ripple. Sales of
French wines aren’t suffering even though some bottles have been dumped down
the drain. And while some state legislatures threatened to boycott French-owned
businesses, it lasted about as long as it took them to discover that French-owned
companies in their own back yard provide thousands of jobs and products for their
residents (Dang, 2003).

17

Interestingly, the boycott does not appear in the trade data either. U.S. imports of French
wine in February 2003 were 36 percent higher than they were in February 2002. The year-onyear increase was 43 percent in March, 26 percent in April, and a huge 50 percent in May, $97
million in 2003 versus $65 million in 2002 (U.S. International Trade Commission, 2006).
We cannot rule out the possibility that the boycott had a very large effect on sales of
French wine. We can, however, rule out the claim that there was a very large effect in one
direction—downward. Rather, with the U.S. deeply divided over the wisdom of engaging in the
Iraq War, the boycott threats might have had both large negative and positive effects,
encouraging pro-war consumers to modify their purchases away from French goods, and
encouraging anti-war consumers to modify their purchases towards French goods.
On March 14, three days before Bush delivered his ultimatum, Middletown, Connecticut,
Navy veteran Bill Earls wrote that he bought a case of French wine in support of the French.
“The French are making some good points and being maligned for it” (Earls, 2003). Around the
same time, Senator Evan Bayh (D-Indiana), when asked on The O’Reilly Factor whether he
would honor the boycott, said, “Well, I’m not going to be running out to buy any French wine in
the near future. I’ll say that” (The O’Reilly Factor, 2003). The most we can say is that the
aggregate effect represented no change in preferences, a surprising result given that even the
French themselves thought that the boycott had been effective.
Besides expressing anti-war sentiments, there may have been many other reasons to buy
French wines. They communicate a modicum of savoir-faire, and they are often cheaper than
comparable California wines. Perhaps people stopped buying Dannon yogurt instead.

Notes: Boycott period is defined as January 27, 2003 to May 18, 2003. Comparison period is defined as January
28, 2002 to May 19, 2002. Boycott dummy equals one for French wine during the boycott period. Holiday period
in columns 1, 3, and 4 is November 4, 2002, through January 26, 2003. Holiday period in columns 2, 5, and 6 is
November 5, 2001, through January 27, 2002, and the column 1, 3, and 4 holiday period. Quantity shares and
revenue shares are multiplied by 100,000. Following Chavis and Leslie (2006), in the log of quantity regressions of
columns 1 and 2 we add a 1 to every quantity for every brand in order not to lose those brands with zero sales in any
given period. Heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors are in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate the estimate is
statistically significant at the ten-, five-, or one-percent level, respectively. All regressions include wine and month
fixed effects.

Notes: Regressions include all observations with strictly positive sales, even though observations
for those same brands may have zero sales in some months, rather than the Table 2 regressions of
only brands with strictly positive sales over the entire period of analysis. Columns 1 through 4
correspond to Table 2, columns 3 through 6. Boycott period is defined as January 27, 2003 to

Notes: Regressions include all observations with strictly positive sales, even though observations for
those same brands may have zero sales in some months, rather than the Table 5 regressions of only
brands with strictly positive sales over the entire period of analysis. Columns 1 through 4 correspond to
Table 5, columns 3 through 6. Boycott period is defined as March 24, 2003 to May 18, 2003.
Comparison period is defined as March 25, 2002 to May 19, 2002. Boycott dummy equals one for
French wine during the boycott period. Holiday period in columns 1 and 2 is November 4, 2002, through
January 26, 2003. Holiday period in columns 3 and 4 is November 5, 2001, through January 27, 2002,
and the column 1 and 2 holiday period. Quantity shares and revenue shares are multiplied by 100,000.
Following Chavis and Leslie (2006), in the log of quantity regressions we add a 1 to every quantity for
every brand in order not to lose those brands with zero sales in any given period. Heteroscedasticityrobust standard errors are in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate the estimate is statistically significant at
the ten-, five-, or one-percent level, respectively. All regressions include wine and month fixed effects.
