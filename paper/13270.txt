Wall Street and Main Street: What Contributes to the Rise in the Highest Incomes?

NBER Working Paper No. 13270

JEL No. G24,G3,H24,J3,J33,M52
ABSTRACT
We consider how much of the top end of the income distribution can be attributed to four sectors -top executives of non-financial firms (Main Street); financial service sector employees from investment
banks, hedge funds, private equity funds, and mutual funds (Wall Street); corporate lawyers; and professional
athletes and celebrities. Non-financial public company CEOs and top executives do not represent
more than 6.5% of any of the top AGI brackets (the top 0.1%, 0.01%, 0.001%, and 0.0001%). Individuals
in the Wall Street category comprise at least as high a percentage of the top AGI brackets as non-financial
executives of public companies. While the representation of top executives in the top AGI brackets
has increased from 1994 to 2004, the representation of Wall Street has likely increased even more.
While the groups we study represent a substantial portion of the top income groups, they miss a large
number of high-earning individuals. We conclude by considering how our results inform different
explanations for the increased skewness at the top end of the distribution. We argue the evidence is
most consistent with theories of superstars, skill biased technological change, greater scale and their
interaction.

Introduction
It is well known that the income distribution in the United States has become increasing unequal

over the last two or three decades.1 The sources of this increased inequality, however, are not completely
understood, particularly at the very top end of the distribution. In this paper, we consider in detail how
much of the inequality today at the top end of the income distribution can be attributed to four different
sectors of the economy – top executives of non-financial firms (Main Street); financial service sector
employees from investment banks, hedge funds, private equity funds, and mutual funds (Wall Street);
lawyers; and professional athletes and celebrities.
Where possible, we estimate how those contributions have varied over time. It is well-known and
well-documented that top executive pay has increased substantially over the last twenty-five years (Hall
and Liebman (1998), Hall and Murphy (2003), Jensen et al (2004), Bebchuk and Fried (2004 and 2006)).
Those increases have generated a great deal of controversy and attention. At the same time, the financial
and legal sectors also have experienced substantial growth over the last twenty-five years both in number
of employees and the pay of those employees. As a result, those sectors also include many high income
individuals. Unlike data on the top executives of public companies, however, compensation on
investment bankers, hedge fund employees, private equity partners, and law firm partners are not
disclosed systematically.
We begin with the data in ExecuComp on compensation for top executives of public companies.
We use two measures of compensation. First, we consider realized or actual compensation that includes
options exercised during the year. While realized compensation estimates the compensation an executive
will recognize on his or her income tax return for one year, it may represent option grants from more or
less than one past year. Since income from stock options is taxed upon exercise, this provides a
reasonable measure of the employment-related compensation the executive actually reports to the IRS
that year. Second, we consider ex ante or estimated compensation that uses the estimated value of options

(2006a), and (2006b).
1

granted that year rather than the value of options exercised. This provides a better measure of the
compensation the board expected to give the CEO that year and clearly represents just one year of
compensation.
We extrapolate the data on those companies to also include non-ExecuComp companies. We
estimate the contribution of all top executives from non-financial and financial firms to the top ends of the
distributions of adjusted gross income (AGI) from the IRS, both recently and for 1994. We consider both
total AGI and AGI excluding investment income.
We estimate that non-financial executives represent 5.25% of the top 0.01% bracket of AGI in
2004 using realized compensation. Using ex ante compensation, the non-financial executives represent
only 3.9% of the top 0.01% bracket. In both cases, top executives explain only a modest fraction of the
top 0.01% bracket. The results are similar for the top 0.001% and 0.0001% brackets.
At the same time, we find that non-financial executives represent 3.9% of the top 0.01% bracket
of AGI in 1994 using realized compensation, and 3.65% using ex ante compensation. Non-financial
executives, therefore, represent a modestly larger fraction of the very top brackets using realized
compensation, and virtually the same fraction using ex ante compensation. While top executive pay
increased substantially over the ten-year period, the increase in pay appears to explain only a modest
fraction of the increase in the top end of the AGI distribution using actual pay. Furthermore, on an ex
ante or expected basis the pay of top executives did not increase more quickly than that of other highly
paid individuals.
We then use the financial statements of publicly-traded investment banking firms (e.g., Goldman
Sachs and Morgan Stanley), and calibrated assumptions of the distribution of compensation within those
firms, to estimate the distribution of the most highly compensated people (whom we refer to as managing
directors) at those firms. We estimate that the managing directors and top executives of the top
investment banking firms comprise a larger percentage of those individuals in the top 0.01% (but a
smaller percentage in the top 0.001%) than the top executives of non-financial public companies.

2

Next, we attempt to estimate incomes for individuals in the asset management business. We look
at hedge fund, venture capital (VC) fund, private equity or buyout (PE) fund and mutual fund investors.
The data here are admittedly very coarse and we make a number of assumptions to obtain estimates of
income. A large number of professionals in these areas are highly compensated. For example, we
estimate that the professionals in hedge funds, VC funds, and PE funds include roughly the same number
of individuals in the top 0.1% of the AGI income distribution as the top non-financial executives. While
it is very difficult to estimate precise distributional changes over time for this sector, we also provide
evidence that these industries are significantly larger today than 10 and 20 years ago and therefore that
their employees must represent a much larger fraction of top quantiles than they did previously.
We also find that hedge fund investors and other “Wall Street” type individuals comprise a larger
fraction of the very highest end of the AGI distribution (the top 0.0001%) than CEOs and top executives.
In 2004, nine times as many Wall Street investors earned in excess of $100 million as public company
CEOs. In fact, the top 25 hedge fund managers combined appear to have earned more than all 500 S&P
500 CEOs combined (both realized and estimated).
We then examine lawyers using profit per partner for the top 50, 100, and 200 law firms in the
United States. The average profit per partner in 2004 in the top 100 firms is $1.0 million, representing
almost 18,000 partners. This compares to an average profit per partner of $0.45 million in 1994
representing 13,000 partners. Profits per partner, therefore, have increased by a factor of almost 2.2 times
while the number of partners has increased by more than 40%. In real terms, profits per partner have
increased by almost 2 times. Similarly, we estimate that the fraction of lawyers in the top 0.5% and 0.1%
AGI brackets increased substantially from 1994 to 2004 (as well as from 1984 to 1994). For example, we
estimate that partners of the top 100 law firms represent 2.4% of the top 0.1% AGI bracket in 2004,
compared to 1.3% in 1994.
Finally, we investigate professional athletes in basketball, baseball, and football. These athletes
represent a similar percentage of the top 0.1% AGI bracket in 2004 as in 1994 (0.8% both years), but a
larger percentage of the top 0.01% AGI bracket (1.5% versus 1.0%). Data on celebrities are not as

3

complete as data on professional athletes but suggest that celebrities comprise a substantially smaller
share of the top fractiles.
Overall, we estimate that the groups we study represent 15% to 26.5% of the individuals who
comprise the AGI categories at and above the top 0.1%. Among the groups we study, non-financial
public company CEOs and top executives are estimated relatively precisely and represent 2.0% to 6.4%
of the very top AGI brackets. In every top AGI bracket, we estimate that Wall Street-related individuals
comprise a greater percentage of the top AGI brackets than non-financial executives of public companies.
When we exclude investment income from AGI, the groups we study represent 22% to 33% of
the individuals in the very top AGI brackets. Non-financial executives do not represent more than 12% of
any of the top AGI brackets excluding investment income.
While our estimates represent a substantial portion of the top income groups, they clearly miss a
large number of high-earning individuals. We suspect that some of the missing individuals are trial
lawyers, executives of privately-held companies, highly paid doctors, and independently wealthy
individuals who have a high AGI. While some of the missing individuals may also be non-top five
executives of publicly-traded companies, the pay of the fifth highest paid executives suggests that this
number is negligible for the top 0.01% and above.
From 1994 to 2004, the representation of top executives of non-financial firms in the top brackets
increased using realized pay, but was virtually the same using and using ex ante pay. The contribution of
lawyers, hedge fund managers, private equity and venture capital professionals to the top brackets
unequivocally increased over this period, and almost certainly to a greater extent than top executives.
We conclude by considering how our results inform different explanations for the increased
skewness at the top end of the distribution. These explanations include trade theories (Hecksher (1931),
Olin (1933), Stolper and Samuelson (1941)), increasing returns to generalists rather than specialists
(Murphy and Zabojnik (2004), Frydman (2005)), stealing theories (Bebchuk and Fried (2004) and
Bebchuk and Grinstein (2005)), social norms (Piketty and Saez (2006a) and Levy and Temin (2007)),
greater scale (Gabaix and Landier (2006)), skill biased technological change (Katz and Murphy (1992),

4

Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg (2006), Garicano and Hubbard (2007)), and the economics of superstars
(Rosen (1981).
It seems unlikely that trade theories can account for the massive observed increase in inequality at
the highest levels of the income distribution, especially given the breadth of this phenomenon and the fact
that it does not affect only the groups for which the products and services are heavily and increasingly
exported or bid for by tradable sectors. For example, an increase in open trade cannot be the primary
factor driving the substantial increase in the pay of U.S. lawyers, given that most of their human capital is
country-specific.
It also seems unlikely that our evidence can be reconciled with the theory of increasing returns to
generalists. It is difficult to argue that lawyers, hedge fund investors, investment bankers, and
professional athletes have become less specialized / more general over time. In fact, the opposite seems
more likely to be true.
While we do not test directly whether any group of individuals is stealing or not, we do not find
that the top brackets are dominated by CEOs and top executives who arguably have the greatest influence
over their own pay. In fact, on an ex ante basis, we find that the representation of CEOs and top
executives in the top brackets has remained constant since 1994. Our evidence, therefore, suggests that
poor corporate governance or managerial power over shareholders cannot be more than a small part of the
picture of increasing income inequality, even at the very upper end of the distribution. We also discuss
the claim that CEOs and top executives are not paid for performance relative to other groups. Contrary to
this claim, we find that realized CEO pay is highly related to firm industry-adjusted stock performance
Our evidence also is hard to reconcile with the arguments in Piketty and Saez (2006a) and Levy
and Temin (2007) that the increase in pay at the top is driven by the recent removal of social norms
regarding pay inequality. Levy and Temin (2007) emphasize the importance of Federal government
policies towards unions, income taxation and the minimum wage. While top executive pay has increased,
so has the pay of other groups, particularly Wall Street groups, who are and have been less subject to
disclosure and social norms over a long period of time. In addition, the compensation arrangements at

5

hedge funds, VC funds, and PE funds have not changed much, if at all, in the last twenty-five or thirty
years (see Sahlman (1990) and Metrick and Yasuda (2007)). Furthermore, it is not clear how greater
unionization would have suppressed the pay of those on Wall Street. In other words, there is no evidence
of a change in social norms on Wall Street. What has changed is the amount of money managed and the
concomitant amount of pay.
Given what we think our evidence does not support, we believe that the evidence remains
consistent with theories of skill biased technological change, superstars, greater scale and their
interaction. With the huge improvements in information technology and the substantial increase in value
of the securities markets over the last twenty-five years, asset managers, investment bankers, lawyers, and
top executives can now apply their talent to much larger pools of money.
Our analysis is most closely related to the second half of Dew-Becker and Gordon (2005). They
consider two possible sources of increasing income inequality – the pay of top executives and the pay of
entertainment and sports superstars. Based on average pay statistics, they claim that those two groups
account for most of the income earned in the very top quantiles of the income distribution. There are
several ways in which our analysis is different from theirs. First, Dew-Becker and Gordon (2005)
interpret the mean statistics from Bebchuk and Grinstein (2005) rather than analyze the distribution of pay
we do. In doing so, they assume that each executive earns the average amount of pay which clearly
ignores the true distribution. Second, they do not consider non-ExecuComp firms. Finally, they do not
measure Wall Street-type professionals or lawyers at all. In his discussion of Dew-Becker and Gordon
(2005), Topel (2005) raises several of these issues.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section II analyzes data from ExecuComp on incomes of top
executives in non-financial and financial firms and their contribution to the income distribution. Section
III focuses on other employees in the financial services and investment sector. Section IV reports our
results on lawyers. Section V reports our results on professional athletes. In section VI, we use the
results in the previous sections to see how much of the top end those groups explain. Section VII

6

discusses the extent to which the different groups are paid for performance. In section VIII, we discuss
the implications of our results on different theories of increased income inequality.

II.

Top Executives (Main Street)
In this section, we consider the contribution of top executives of public companies in the U.S. to

the top end of the income distribution. We begin with the top executives in the ExecuComp database.
ExecuComp covers the compensation of top executives of the companies in the S&P 500, the S&P
Midcap 400, and the S&P Smallcap 600, plus some companies that were in those indices in previous
years. In this analysis, we focus on the year 2004 because it is the most recent for which complete data
are available, and 1994 because it is the first year that ExecuComp has full coverage of the index
companies. For the year 1994, ExecuComp covered 1,747 total companies, and for 2004 it covered 1,722
total companies.
ExecuComp reports two summary measures of compensation, TDC1 and TDC2. TDC2 estimates
the value of total compensation realized by the executive in a given year. This is the sum of salary,
bonus, the value of restricted stock granted, the net value of stock options exercised and the value of longterm incentive payouts. TDC2 also will reflect any benefit that an executive may have received from
backdating options. TDC2 will be closer to the amount reported as income on an executive’s tax return.
Because executives typically exercise options granted in previous years, TDC2 may represent
compensation from more than one (or less than one) year.
TDC1 estimates the value of total compensation awarded (but not necessarily realized) to the
executive that year. This equals TDC2 but replaces the net value of stock options exercised with the
estimated value of stock options granted, using a Black-Scholes calculation. TDC1 does not reflect
option backdating benefits because it assumes that the stock price on the issue date was the same as the
exercise price.

7

Reported taxable income may differ from TDC2 because some restricted stock grants are not
taxable until they vest. In any given year, an executive’s true taxable income will reflect the restricted
stock grants that vested that year which will include some current year as well as past year grants.
Reported AGI also will differ from TDC2 to the extent that executives earn income from other
sources, such as directorships of other companies, or interest, dividend, and capital gains income. To
control for this, we also consider AGI brackets that exclude investment income and reach qualitatively
similar conclusions. Other deferred compensation, such as pension benefits, also will not appear in TDC2
or TDC1 nor would they appear in AGI.2 An additional caveat when looking at AGI comparisons is that
AGI is calculated at the level of the tax filing unit, whereas we consider individuals. In other words, we
essentially assume that none of the individuals in our paper are married to each other or to other high
earners. While not precisely true, we do not believe this is a large source of bias in our estimates.
To summarize, TDC2 will be closer to an executive’s true AGI while TDC1 will more closely
approximate the compensation a company’s board expected to pay the executive.
We also assume that all of the top executives are U.S. citizens and report all of their income to the
U.S. tax authorities. Because some top executives are not U.S. citizens or are taxed elsewhere, our results
will overstate the number of executives that actually appear in the relevant tax brackets.
For 1994 and 2004, we report the number of top executives in each AGI income bracket based on
TDC2 and TDC1. We restrict our sample in several additional ways. First, we remove any duplicated
observations for a given individual. Second, we restrict attention to only the top five most highly
compensated executives per firm. ExecuComp typically takes as many executives as happen to be in the
disclosure statements, which may be more than the legally required 5. The average number of unique
executive names per firm-year in Execucomp was 6.7 in 1994 and declined to 5.9 in 2004. As we do not
want our results affected by changing coverage, we keep only the largest 5 TDC2 observations for each
firm-year. Finally, for executives who appear in the top 5 at multiple firms within a given year (perhaps

2

Sundaram and Yermack (2005) estimate the average change in pension value is 10% of total compensation (TDC1)
for Fortune 500 CEOs from 1996 to 2002.
8

because they started the year at one firm and ended the year at another), we sum the TDC2 they earned at
each firm to convert these multiple observations into one observation.
While most ExecuComp companies are non-financial companies, some, like Goldman Sachs, are
financial services companies, such as banks and investment banks. Accordingly, we divide the
ExecuComp executives into non-financial and financial executives. Financial executives are executives
of firms that have an SIC code from 6000 to 6299. We consider firms with SIC codes at 6300 and above
to be non-financials; these firms include insurance companies and real estate agents and operators. We
classify them as non-financials because they are generally not “Wall Street” type firms. Financial firms
comprised 42 of the S&P 500, 30 of the S&P Midcap 400, and 55 of the S&P Smallcap 600 in 1994 and
47 of the S&P 500, 33 of the S&P Midcap 400, and 32 of the S&P Smallcap 600 in 2004.
Table 1a reports the number of non-financial and financial ExecuComp executives in each AGI
bracket. The cutoffs for the top fractiles of AGI income in 1994 are calculated based on the detailed IRS
Statistics of Income files for US individuals, held at the NBER. The cutoffs for the top fractiles of AGI
income in 2004 are calculated based on the 2002 distribution (the latest years for which the detailed files
are available) and the relation between the 2002 and 2004 fractiles documented in the tabulations of
Piketty and Saez (2003, 2006).
Table 1a shows that from 1994 to 2004, CEO and top executive compensation increased
substantially. For the top five non-financial ExecuComp executives, the average nominal realized
compensation (TDC2) increased from $0.91 million in 1994 to $2.82 million in 2004. For financial
executives, the increase was from $1.32 million to $4.54 million.
Using realized compensation, the table shows that non-financial ExecuComp executives represent
a somewhat larger fraction of the top AGI brackets in 2004 than they did in 1994. The increase is small
in the top 0.1%, but larger in the brackets above. For example, non-financial ExecuComp executives
represented 2.25% of the top 0.1% in 1994 and 2.58% in 2004. At the same time, for the top 0.01%, they
represented 2.56% in 1994, but 4.46% in 2004; for the top 0.001%, 1.90% in 1994, and 5.06% in 2004.

9

While the top executive share of the very top brackets has increased, the top executives comprise a
modest fraction of those brackets.
Using ex ante or estimated compensation, the picture is quite different. the table shows that nonfinancial ExecuComp executives occupy roughly the same fraction of the top brackets in 2004 as they did
in 1994 except for the very top where their share actually declines. For example, non-financial
ExecuComp executives represent 3.65% of the top 0.01% in 1994 and 3.54% in 2004. At the same time,
they represent 2.50% of the top 0.001% in 1994, but only 1.74% in 2004.
For comparison with other studies, table 1b shows the results for ExecuComp CEOs only. The
results are qualitatively similar to those for all top executives. CEOs have maintained or increased their
share of the top brackets using realized compensation, and have more or less maintained their share using
ex ante or estimated compensation.
Tables 1a and 1b show the fraction of financial executives in the top brackets also increase using
realized pay, but remain roughly the same using estimated pay. According to Table 1a, financial
executives comprise 0.57% of the AGIs in the top 0.01% in 1994 compared to 0.77% of the AGIs in 2004
using realized pay. Using estimated pay, financial executives comprise 0.80% of the top 0.01% in 1994
and 0.62% in 2004.
While the ExecuComp data cover over 1,600 publicly-traded companies, there were a total of
8,060 publicly traded companies in 2004 for which equity market values are available in Compustat.
Accordingly, we estimate the compensation of top executives in the non-ExecuComp companies. We
sample proxy statements to measure compensation for up to 50 non-ExecuComp companies in each of
three size brackets. We do this because the non-ExecuComp companies are small relative to the
ExecuComp companies and compensation tends to be lower in smaller companies (see Bebchuk and
Grinstein (2005) or Gabaix and Landier (2006)).
We use three size brackets that are analogous to those in the ExecuComp data. We assume that if
a firm's equity market value exceeds the maximum equity market value for S&P400 Midcap firms, it is
like an S&P500 firm. We identify fewer than 50 such firms. The second group includes firms with

10

equity market values above $1 billion but below the maximum for S&P 400 Midcap firms. The third
group includes firms with equity market values below $1 billion, but above the minimum equity market
value for the S&P600 Smallcap firms. We exclude firms with market values below the minimum for the
S&P 600 Smallcap, assuming that these companies have virtually no very high paid executives.
Table 1c assumes that top executive compensation in the non-ExecuComp firms in each size class
mirrors the top executive compensation of the firms that we sampled in each size class. Table 1c
indicates that there are relatively few very highly paid executives in non-ExecuComp firms. The table
also shows that top executives in non-financial non-ExecuComp firms comprise a lower fraction of the
top 0.01% of AGI brackets in 2004 than they do in 1994 – 0.79% versus 1.34% – but a higher fraction of
the top 0.001% – 1.34% versus 0 – using realized compensation. The top executives occupy a higher
fraction of the very top brackets using ex ante or estimate compensation. In all cases, however, the
magnitudes are quite modest, never exceeding 1.36% of any bracket.
Table 1c also combines the estimates for ExecuComp and non-Execucomp non-financial
executives. Using realized compensation, non-financial executives overall occupied 5.25% of the top
0.01% and 6.4% of the top 0.001% in 2004 compared to 3.9% and 1.9%, respectively, in 1994. Using
estimated compensation, non-financial executives overall occupied 3.9% of the top 0.01% and 1.9% of
top 0.001% in 2004 compared to 3.65% and 2.5% in 1994.
Table 1d repeats the analyses in tables 1a and 1c for non-financial executives, but uses AGI
brackets that exclude investment income including dividends, interest, rentals, farm income, IRA
distributions, income from estates and trusts, pension and annuity distributions, long term capital gains,
and Form 4797 income. This increases the percentage of the brackets occupied by the top executives.
Using realized income, table 1d indicates that top executives of all non-financial firms comprise 8.55% of
the top 0.01% in 2004 versus 6.07% in 1994. For the top 0.001%, the top executives comprise 11.87% in
2004 versus 3.97% in 1994. Using estimated income, table 1d indicates that top executives of all nonfinancial firms comprise 7.28% of the top 0.01% in 2004 versus 6.18% in 1994. For the top 0.001%, the
top executives comprise 5.90% in 2004 versus 5.35% in 1994.

11

Overall, the analyses of top executives show two main patterns. First, using estimated or ex ante
pay the share of non-financial top executives’ share of the very top AGI brackets is small and has
remained roughly the same since 1994. Second, using realized pay, the share of non-financial top
executives in the top 0.01% has increased modestly, but has increased more substantially at the very top –
in the top 0.001%.
It is worth ending with one additional point. It is possible that we leave out a large number of
high earners by restricting the sample to the top 5 executives. To assess whether this is true, we look at
the pay of the fifth highest paid executive (assuming that all others are below this level). The results in
table 1e suggest that including non-top 5 executives would not affect our basic results at all at brackets at
the top 0.01% and above. In 2004, table 1e shows that only 7 non-financial ExecuComp executives are
in the top 0.01% bracket using realized pay and only 14 are in that bracket using estimated pay. The
corresponding numbers in 1994 are 5 and 18. These represent at most 0.17% of their respective brackets.
They also represent similar percentages in 2004 and 1994.

Wall Street
A.

Investment Banking

It is well-known that investment banking and other financial services firms have a large number
of highly compensated individuals. Because firms are not required to disclose individual compensation
for these individuals, it is not clear how large the amounts are and how many individuals earn them.
Investment banks typically report only a very small amount of information about the compensation of
their employees, generally limited to a figure for total global employee compensation plus the usual
figures for compensation of the top five corporate executives. These disclosures likely obscure the fact
that there are many highly paid professionals at the firm who are not among the top five employees.
Indeed, the typical managing director at a top Wall Street firm will almost never earn less than $500,000 a
year in total compensation, and there are thousands of these individuals.

12

In this section, we attempt to estimate the number of highly paid professionals at Wall Street
securities firms, as well as their distribution of pay, and examine how this number and distribution
compare to the statistics on executives of publicly traded companies. We use publicly available
information on total compensation from the top 10 publicly-traded investment banks. Based on
discussions with industry insiders, we create a distribution of income for these firms. We then attempt to
extrapolate from that information to other firms.

1. Counting the Managing Directors
We use the title managing director to describe the top echelon of securities firm professionals and
begin with a detailed study of ten of the top eleven securities firms from the list of the top 100 securities
firms by Institutional Investor (2004). Institutional Investor organizes this list by total consolidated
capital of the securities unit of the firms in question; the ten we study comprise roughly 90% of the total
consolidated capital of the top 100. These firms are listed in Table 2a. We exclude Bank of America
Securities from our top 10 because of data availability issues, and instead include number 11, J.P. Morgan
Securities.
There are several complications that we attempt to address in this analysis. First, several of the
top 10 are divisions of conglomerates that include both investment and commercial banks. We focus on
only the securities businesses of these firms, including asset and wealth management but excluding
commercial banking. While some firms report disaggregated segment level information on total number
of employees, many do not. Where necessary, we use the ratio of segment net revenue to total net
revenue to derive an estimate of segment employees. Second, while some securities firms report the
number of managing directors, many do not. In these cases we either rely on industry sources that
estimate this figure or estimate the number of global managing directors as a fraction of global
employees. When we apply ratios, we typically use figures between 3 and 4 percent, calibrating in many
cases to information from industry insiders. Third, while some firms report U.S. information separately
from global information, in many cases we needed to estimate the number of U.S. employees. Where

13

necessary, we use the ratio of U.S. to global net revenues to estimate this figure. Finally, we generally
assume that the ratio of U.S. to global employees is indicative of the ratio of U.S. to global revenues.
Table 2a presents our assessment of the likely number of U.S. managing directors at these ten
firms. Non-italicized figures are numbers taken directly from the financial reports of the companies in
question or calculated as ratios of figures taken directly from the reports. Italicized figures represent our
imputations, in which we have attempted to be as conservative as possible.
We use relatively straightforward calculations to estimate the managing directors at Goldman
Sachs Group and Bear Stearns Companies. The 2004 Goldman Sachs annual report lists the number of
managing directors at 1,181. The annual report also lists 20,722 global employees with 13,278 based in
the U.S. for a ratio of 64%. We apply this ratio to the number of managing directors to derive an estimate
of 757 managing directors based in the U.S. For Bear Stearns, although the company does not list its
managing directors, industry insiders revealed approximately 850 global managing directors.
Furthermore, while this firm does not detail the U.S. versus non-U.S. employee breakdown, 91% of Bear
Stearns revenues originate in the U.S. We therefore estimate that Bear Stearns had 770 (91% of 850)
managing directors based in the U.S. in 2004. Both Goldman Sachs and Bear Stearns are essentially pure
investment banks, so there are no complications involved with deriving segment-level estimates.
Lehman Brothers also provides a relatively straightforward case. The annual report lists 19,600
global employees with 14,100 based in the U.S. Unfortunately, we do not know the number of managing
directors at this firm. We assume a conservative 4% (compared to the implied figures of 6% for Goldman
Sachs and 8% for Bear Stearns), calibrated from conversations with industry insiders. This leads to a
figure of 564 managing directors based in the U.S. in 2004.
Morgan Stanley is an example of a firm that engages in other non-securities related activities,
including Discover credit cards and retail brokerage. The annual report provides the number of total
employees and the number of managing directors for the firm. We estimate the number of employees in
each segment by applying the ratio of segment to total net revenues to the number of global employees.
For example, we estimate that the institutional securities division has 29,472 employees, which is 53,284

14

times the ratio of $13,313 to $23,708. We assume that all the managing directors come from the
institutional securities and asset management divisions. This implies that 3% of the employees in those
divisions are managing directors, still very low relative to Lehman, Goldman, and Bear Stearns. We
estimate U.S. employment as the ratio of U.S. to total net revenue, which we assume is roughly constant
across segments of the firm. These calculations yield 780 managing directors at Morgan Stanley.
Proceeding in this fashion for the remaining investment banks, we count 6,006 managing
directors based in the U.S. working for these ten firms. We believe that this number is conservative.
Private conversations with industry participants suggest that we underestimate the highly paid investment
bankers at some of these firms. We also estimate that adding the rest of the U.S. investment banking
sector would raise this figure by a considerable, but unknown amount. In our analysis, we report the
income distribution per 10,000 managing directors. We believe this is a reasonable guess as to the total
number of managing directors or employees receiving managing director type pay. In any investment
bank, there will be a number of highly paid employees who are not yet managing directors. If one
wanted to be conservative, we think 7,000 managing directors would represent a minimum.

2. Estimating the Distribution of Pay
According to industry sources, it is rare for a managing director at a top Wall Street firm to
receive compensation of less than $500,000 during the period we are studying. Furthermore, we
understand that at least one quarter of managing directors earn in excess of $2.5 million per year. 3
Based on this information, we consider two possible distributions of pay. The first is a pareto distribution
with a minimum value of $500,000, which we truncate at $35 million, as this is approximately the top
value observed for any investment banking employee.
The cumulative distribution function of the pareto distribution takes the form:
3

Our estimates are based on conversations with industry sources. For confirmation, see Lisa Kasenaar, The
International Herald Tribune, February 6, 2006 who reports that the Options Group, an executive-search company,
estimated that “managing directors may get an average bonus of about $2.25 million in coming weeks” in 2005; as
well as Duff McDonald’s “Please, Sir, I Want Some More. How Goldman Sachs is carving up its $11 billion money
pie,” in New York Magazine, December 5, 2005
15

⎛ x ⎞
P ( X > x) = ⎜ ⎟
⎝ xm ⎠

−k

where xm is the minimum value of $500,000 and we estimate k = 0.8613 based on the restriction that 25%
of the distribution earns more than $2.5 million. This distribution yields estimates that are more
conservative at the bottom of the distribution than would be accepted by most industry insiders, with
almost half of the managing directors earning less than $1 million.
The second distribution is an exponential distribution, which we censor below at $500,000. The
cumulative distribution function of the exponential distribution takes the form:
P ( X > x) = 1 − e − β x

where we estimate β = 0.00055 based on the restriction that 25% of the distribution earns more than $2.5
million. This distribution is more liberal at the upper end of the distribution than the truncated pareto,
though it is more conservative at the very top. The censored exponential distribution allows only 0.1% of
managing directors to earn more than $20 million, compared to 0.3% as given by the truncated pareto
distribution.
It is our understanding that most of the pay estimated here will show up in AGI for the managing
directors. Most of the investment banks are public companies and C corporations. The MDs of these
firms will receive taxable income. MDs of private firms may receive K-1 or partnership income. It is our
understanding that the majority of income and bonus that MDs receive is in the form of cash. This will
appear in AGI in the year it is received. For many investment banks, MDs receive some fraction of
compensation as restricted stock and options or defer some compensation. For this compensation, there
will be a timing difference between our estimates and actual AGI. For example, restricted stock will
appear as income when it vests and option gains will appear when the options are exercised.
Table 2b reports the estimated distributions of pay for 10,000 managing directors alongside the
AGI brackets. The first vertical panel presents the percentage of managing directors in each AGI bracket.
The Pareto distribution implies that 60% of the MDs earn less than $1.4 million (the top 0.1% threshold)
while the exponential distribution implies that number is 31%. The average MD earns $1.9 million

16

(Pareto) and $2.8 million (exponential). Based on conversations with industry insiders, we believe the
exponential distribution is somewhat more realistic.
The second vertical panel presents the percent of each bracket accounted for by every 10,000
managing directors, and the third panel presents the number of individuals earning at least the minimum
bracket amount for every 10,000 managing directors. As noted above, we believe that 10,000 managing
directors is a reasonable estimate for Wall Street as a whole.
Using our assumptions, we estimate that the 10,000 top-tier managing directors at investment
banks generate enough AGI to explain at least 5.8% (Pareto) or 11.2% (exponential) of the top 0.01% of
the AGI distribution. These are at least as large as our estimates for all top non-financial executives of
5.25% using realized compensation and 3.9% using ex ante compensation. The MDs explain a lower
fraction of the top 0.001%.
We also estimate that the MDs earn a total of $19 billion (Pareto) to $28 billion (exponential).
This is slightly lower, but the same order of magnitude as our estimate of $34 billion (realized) and $27
billion (ex ante) for all top non-financial executives.
Overall, then, investment bankers appear to explain roughly the same amount of the top end of
the income distribution as top executives of non-financial firms.

3.

Historical Wall Street.

It seems likely that the number of managing directors on Wall Street and their compensation have
increased substantially in the last 20 or 30 years. Unfortunately, data availability concerns make it
difficult if not impossible to repeat our 2004 analysis for earlier periods. We can, however, get a sense of
the growth in Wall Street by compare the number of employees and capital employed at Wall Street firms
over time. The Securities Industry Association (SIA) provides a list of the top 50 securities firms each
year. We collected the 2004 list as well as the 1987 list (the furthest back we could find). We also
obtained the list of the top 50 securities firms in 1972 provided by the Investment Banker-Broker
Almanac.

17

Table 2c reports the total number of global employees and the total global capital employed at the
top 50 U.S. securities firms in 1972, 1987, and 2004. Employment increased by 170% from 1972 to 1987
and, by 79% from 1987 to 2004. Capital employed by those employees increased exponentially by more
than ten times from 1972 to 1987, and by more than twenty times from 1987 to 2004. Capital per
employee, therefore, increased substantially as well, from $34 thousand ($124 thousand in $2004) in 1972
to $136 thousand ($203 thousand) in 1994 to $1,789 thousand in 2004. This represents a remarkable
increase in capital per employee, particularly since 1994.
Similarly, Morrison and Wilhelm (2007) present evidence concerning investment banks in the
1960s and 1970s. In 1970, their tabulations indicate that the top twenty-three investment banks have a
total of fewer than 1,600 partners and average capital per partner of less than $0.75 million. This would
represent $3 million of capital per partner in 2004 dollars. Assuming that the firms in table 2c have
10,000 managing directors, table 2c implies almost $70 million of capital per managing director, a 23 fold
increase relative to 1970.

B.

Alternative Assets

Over the last twenty years, there has been a large increase in the amount of money allocated by
institutional investors and wealthy individuals to alternative asset classes. The most prominent members
of the alternative asset classes are hedge funds, venture capital (VC) funds, and private equity (PE) or
buyout funds. These funds are of interest for compensation and the income distribution because the
hedge fund, VC and PE fund investors potentially receive substantial compensation.
The fees typically paid to the alternative asset fund – whether hedge, VC or PE fund – consists of
a management fee that equals a percentage of total or committed capital and a profit share or carried
interest of the profits of the fund (after paying the management fees). The typical compensation for hedge
funds today is 2 / 20, i.e., 2% management fee and 20% of the profits on total capital although the top
performing hedge funds charge more. This also is typical for VC and PE funds based on committed
capital. It is typical for the larger PE funds to reduce the management fee to 1½% of committed capital

18

while smaller VC funds increase the management fee to 2½%.4

In this section, we attempt to estimate

the amount of fees paid to the managers of alternative assets, how those fees have increased over time,
and the effect of those fees on the income distribution.

1. Hedge Funds

It is well known that hedge funds have experienced a large increase in assets under management
in the last twenty years. Table 3a provides time series of hedge fund assets from three different databases,
Hennessee Group, Hedge Fund Research, and TASS. All three confirm the large increase in hedge fund
assets from less than $50 billion in 1990 to roughly $1 trillion by the end of 2005.
The last three columns of table 3a use the Hennessee Group assets under management, realized
(net) hedge fund returns and the typical compensation of 2% / 20% to estimate the fees earned by hedge
fund managers. The management fees are estimated by multiplying the assets under management at the
beginning of the year (end of previous year) by 2%. The profit share or carry is estimated by multiplying
the average return for the year if it is positive by the beginning of year assets under management to get net
profit. Because net profit is after carry, we gross up the net profit by dividing by 80% to get the gross
profit for the year. We then take 20% of the gross profit as the estimate of the profit share. Total fees are
the sum of management fees and carried interest. Table 3a estimates that hedge fund fees have increased
from less than $0.5 billion in 1987 to less than $2 billion in 1994 to $17.5 billion in 2004 and $20.5
billion in 2005.
This calculation almost certainly understates compensation because it assumes that all hedge
funds earn the average return for the year. Because the 20% profit share is applied only to positive
returns (and not negative returns) any appreciable dispersion across funds such that some funds earn
negative returns (but not negative carry) implies that the actual profit share exceeds the estimates above.
In other words, the profit share acts like a call option.

4

See Gompers and Lerner (1999) and Metrick and Yasuda (2007).
19

Malkiel (2005) reports a standard deviation of 11% on the Van Global Hedge Fund index. Chany
et al. (2005) report a standard deviation of 8.25% on the CSFB / Tremont hedge fund index. They report
mean annualized standard deviations across a sample of over 4,000 individual hedge funds that exceeds
14%. If we conservatively assume a standard deviation of 11% and risk free rate of 3%, using BlackScholes, a one year call option is worth almost 6% (with a 14% standard deviation, roughly 7%). The
20% profit share is 20% of a call option on an entire fund. This implies that the profit share has an
expected annual cost of 1.2% at the 11% standard deviation. Under the assumption of 11% standard
deviation of hedge fund returns, the expected fees on a 2 / 20 hedge fund are roughly 3.2%. The last
column of table 3a calculates fees on this basis, and figure 1 depicts the results. The estimated fees for
2004 increase from $17.5 under the simple method to over $25.4 billion. Obviously, the estimate would
be higher under higher volatility assumptions. Interestingly, the $25.4 billion figure is the same order of
magnitude as the total pay to non-financial top executives and to investment banking MDs.
It is clear there has been a large increase in fees going to hedge funds. There is no doubt that
much of this increase shows up as compensation to the owners of the hedge funds and the people they
hire.5 It is difficult to know exactly how much. In what follows, we provide some rough estimates.
We begin with the list of the top 100 hedge fund firms in Institutional Investor (II) in 2005 which
measures assets as of the end of 2004. According to II, these hedge funds managed $568 billion. Of the
100 firms, 79 are listed as U.S. companies with $459 billion under management. We searched the SEC
Investment Advisor Public Disclosure database for information on these funds. Forty-six of these funds
provided information to the SEC. These funds are listed by II as having $268 billion of hedge fund
money under management.
The funds reporting to the SEC must list a range of the number of the total number of employees
as well as the number of employees who are investment advisory. On average, the forty-six funds list a
minimum of 89 and a maximum of 255 employees as well as a minimum of 26 and a maximum of 109
5

Hedge funds may be organized as partnerships in which some of the carried interest is taxed as capital gains. Thus,
carried interest would appear as part of AGI, but would be taxed at lower rates. In addition, there is some evidence
that hedge fund managers defer the realization of ordinary income into the future. See Fleischer (2007).
20

investment advisory employees. This works out to $160 million per minimum number of employees and
$36 million per maximum number of employees. Similarly, this works out to $550 million per minimum
number of employees and $159 million per maximum number of investment advisory employees. The
average of the minimum and maximum is $98 million per employee and $305 million per investment
advisory employee.
Another way of looking at this is to divide the total hedge fund assets at these firms by the total
number of employees. On this basis, the firms have $65 million per minimum number of employees and
$23 million per maximum number of employees. Similarly, this works out to $220 million per minimum
number of employees and $54 million per maximum number of investment advisory employees. The
average of the minimum and maximum is $44 million per employee and $137 million per investment
advisory employee.
In what follows, we assume that the average highly paid employee controls or is compensated
from $100 million of assets. Under the assumption of total fees of 3.2%, this works out to $3.2 million in
fees per highly compensated employee. If we then apply this to $900 billion of hedge fund assets, we
obtain 9,000 highly compensated employees with average fees of $3.2 million.
This is a very rough estimate. This overstates total compensation to these employees because the
hedge fund must pay expenses from these fees. However, operating margins in the asset management
business are quite high. Before compensating top executives and paying mutual fund marketing expenses
(which hedge fund firms do not pay), it is common for publicly-traded mutual fund firms to report
operating margins exceeding 70%.6 These estimates also overstate the number of employees who are
highly compensated to the extent that some of the assets and employees are not in the United States. At
the same time, these estimates will understate total compensation per employee to the extent that the
hedge fund firms have other activities and manage other assets.

6

See, for example, 2005 10-Ks for Calamos Asset Management, Eaton Vance, and Janus Capital.
21

It is likely that many of the big hedge fund payments will appear as ordinary partnership income
on the K-1’s of the owners or partners of the hedge funds. Some unknown number of the most highly
compensated employees who are not partners will receive W-2 income.
Given the huge increase in hedge fund assets, it is virtually certain that the number of highly
compensated employees at hedge funds has increased substantially over time. In 1984, when there were
almost no hedge funds, there would have been very few such employees. In 1994, when hedge funds had
less than $100 million in assets under management, hedge fund fees were roughly 10% of the fees in
2005. At the same fee per employee ratio, this implies a ten-fold increase in the number of highly
compensated employees. To the extent that the amount of money managed per individual has increased,
the number of highly compensated employees will have increased less, but the compensation of each
individual will have increased more.

2.

Venture Capital and Private Equity Funds

The capital committed to venture capital (VC) private equity (PE) or buyout funds also has
increased substantially over time. The first three columns of table 3b present the capital committed to
U.S. VC funds, the number of funds raised each year from 1980 to 2005, and capital per fund according
to Thomson Financial’s Venture Economics database. The next three columns do the same for PE firms.
When a VC or PE firm raises a fund, its investors (limited partners) commit to provide a certain amount
of money over the investing life of the fund (usually five years). The investments are harvested over the
subsequent five to ten years, giving a total commitment period or investment life of ten to fifteen years.
The commitments, therefore, represent money committed, but not necessarily invested in a given year.
The table shows that combined annual commitments to VC and PE funds have grown from less
than $2.5 billion combined in 1982 to less than $35 billion in 1994 to over $150 billion in 2005. Both the
number of funds and the size of the average fund have increased.
For purposes of calculating fees, columns 7 and 8 estimate the total amount of money under
management in VC and PE at any one time as the sum of the capital committed over the previous seven

22

years (including the current year). This assumes that the VC and PE firms earn management fees on the
capital committed for seven years. Most funds actually earn management fees for ten years, but the
management fee typically declines after the five year investment period. Overall, the seven year
assumption will tend to be conservative.
As mentioned above, compensation typically consists of a management fee (based on committed
capital) and a share of the profits. Metrick and Yasuda (2007) report median management fees of 2% and
median profit shares of 20% for a large sample of VC and PE funds raised from 2000 to 2005.
Accordingly, the last four columns estimate fees paid to VC and PE funds using the analogous
methodology to that used initially for hedge funds. The management fees are estimated by multiplying
the assets under management at the beginning of the year (end of previous year) by 2%. The profit share
is estimated by multiplying the average return for the year (provided by Venture Economics) if it is
positive by the beginning of year assets under management to get net profit. Because net profit is after
carry, we gross up the net profit by dividing by 80% to get the gross profit for the year. We then take
20% of the gross profit as the estimate of the profit share. Total fees are the sum of management fees and
carried interest.
VC and PE fees also have increased substantially over time. Under these assumptions, the
combined fees to VC and PE funds have increased from less than $0.25 billion in 1984 to almost $3
billion in 1994 to roughly $18 billion in 2004 and 2005.
As with the hedge funds, the simple calculation above almost certainly understates compensation
because it assumes that all VC and PE funds earned the average return for the year. In fact, returns are
volatile around the average and the 20% profit share acts like a call option, increasing in value with
volatility. It also is likely the case that VC and PE fund returns are more volatile than hedge fund returns
because they are calculated based on performance over the life of the fund rather than annually.
Kaplan and Schoar (2005) present evidence on the performance of VC and PE funds. They report
that the historical standard deviation of the returns on VC funds is between 19% and 34%; on PE funds,
between 19% and 27%. (The standard deviations depend on whether funds are value- or equal-weighted

23

and whether the returns are calculated by Venture Economics or Kaplan and Schoar.) If we
conservatively, assume a standard deviation of 22%, risk-free rate of 3%, the 20% profit share and a 2%
management fee, the expected annual fees for VC and PE firms equal 4% of assets under management.
As depicted in figure 2, this would equal a total for VC and PE firms of roughly $30 billion in 2004 and
2005.
Again, the $18 billion to $30 billion estimates are the same order of magnitude as the total pay to
non-financial top executives, investment banking MDs, and hedge fund investors.
How do these fees translate into compensation? In their sample of VC and PE funds, Metrick
and Yasuda (2007) report that the typical VC and PE fund has 6 partners (median of 5 and average of
6.4). Over the last five years, the Venture Economics figures indicate over 1,000 VC funds and almost
900 PE funds have been raised. This implies more than 10,000 highly compensated partners, a large
increase over the number 25 years ago.
At $18 billion in fees, this represents roughly $1.3 million per VC partner and $2.3 million per PE
partner; at $30 billion in fees, this represents $2.0 million per VC partner and $3.8 million per PE partner.
Even these estimates may be low. Metrick and Yasuda (2007) estimate that the average partner in a VC
firm can expect to receive $13 million in present value over the life of a fund; the average partner in a PE
firm, $18 million in present value. Assuming a fund lasts for ten years, this works out to fees of $1.3
million and $1.8 million per partner per year in present value. However, successful firms invest their
funds in four to five years or less, at which point they raise another fund. As a result, the net present
value may effectively reflect four or five years of fees, not ten. Assuming five years, this would put the
present value of average annual fees received per partner at VC and PE firms equal to $2.6 million and
$3.6 million, respectively.
Our calculations and those of Metrick and Yasuda (2007), then, give us a range of fees per
partner of $1.3 to $2.6 million per VC partner and $1.8 to $3.8 million per PE partner. The fees, of
course, do not equal compensation received by the partners. VC and PE firms must pay operating
expenses – employee salaries, rents, travel, deal costs, etc. – out of the fees. It is difficult to know exactly

24

what fraction of fees these expenses represent. It seems reasonable to assume that the expenses must be
less than the management fee. Otherwise, the partners would need to finance their business themselves.
As the management fees represent roughly ½ of the total fees, this puts a lower bound on partner
compensation of ½ of the amounts at the beginning of this paragraph. In addition, these fees are averages.
We have not attempted to estimates the distribution around these averages.
PE and VC investors are likely taxed similarly to hedge fund investors in that most of the income
will appear as partnership income on the K-1’s of the owners or partners of the funds. The one difference
is that a larger fraction of the PE and VC income will be in the form of long term capital gains. The
reason for this is that most of the investments will have a term of greater than one year and the 20% profit
shares on those investments will appear as capital gains. (Again, see Fleischer (2007)).
In summary, there is no doubt that VC and PE partners have contributed to the increase in the top
end of the income distribution. It seems likely that almost all of the 10,000 individuals earn in excess of
the $0.48 million necessary to put them in the top 0.5% of the income distribution.
As estimated fees increased by more than ten times from 1984 to 1994, and, again, by a factor of
six times from 1994 to 2005, this undoubtedly represents a large increase in the number of such
individuals since 1984 and 1994. In 1984, roughly 500 VC and PE funds were raised over the previous
five years. These funds had capital under management of $19 billion. At 4% total fees, this translates
into $0.76 billion of fees. With six partners per fund, this translates into 3,000 partners and $0.25 million
in fees per partner or $0.41 million per partner in $2005. So, the number of partners has more than tripled
and the fees per partner have increased by more than a factor of five times over this period.

3.

Contributions to the top end of the distribution

In the previous subsection, we estimate average fees per highly compensated individual or partner
in hedge fund, VC, and PE firms. We are unable to estimate the contributions of such firms to the very
high end of the distribution. In this section, we use other data sources to attempt to do so.

25

Table 4a presents Institutional Investor’s estimates of the incomes of the top 25 most
compensated hedge fund managers from 2003 to 2005. The table also presents the estimates for those
hedge fund managers based in the U.S. The table confirms that the top hedge fund investors earn large
amounts of compensation. The 20th most highly paid hedge fund manager in the U.S. earned $92, $110
and $150 million, respectively in those three years. This compares to 3 non-financial ExecuComp U.S.
executives and our estimate of 4 total non-financial U.S. executives who earned more than $100 million
in 2004.
It also is striking that the top 25 individual hedge fund managers in the U.S. earned a combined
total of $5.2 billion, $6.3 billion and over $9 billion, respectively, in 2003, 2004 and 2005.
Table 4b presents estimated earnings of top earners in the financial industry more broadly. The
first two columns present the rankings from Financial World for 1988 and 1995. Financial World
includes all financial industry individuals including investment bankers, hedge fund and private equity
investors. The last three columns combine the rankings from Trader Monthly and II Alpha for 2003 to
2005.
Trader Monthly ranks the top traders and hedge fund professionals only. The Trader Monthly
and Alpha lists do not include PE and VC investors and, therefore, understate such incomes relative to the
Financial World rankings. The recent S-1 filings of Blackstone and KKR indicate that some PE investors
earn sums comparable to those of the hedge fund investors. For example, KKR reported net income of
$773 million and $941 million in 2004 and 2005. With Henry Kravis and George Roberts each owning
37.5% of KKR, these imply incomes for Kravis and Robers of almost $300 million in 2004 and over $350
million in 2005. Blackstone reported net income of $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion in 2004 and 2005. The
29.8% of Blackstone owned by Stephen Schwartzman implies income of $447 million and $388 million
in 2004 and 2005. At least two other Blackstone executives appear to have earned more than $60 million
each in each of those two years.
Although we do not include PE investor incomes, table 4b suggests some conclusions. There is
not much of a change in the very top end of the distribution from 1988 to 1995. In both 1988 and 1995,

26

40 individuals earned more than $30 million in $2004 and 10 individuals earned more than $82 million in
$2004. There appears to have been a large increase in the top end since then. In 2004 and 2005, among
only the traders and hedge fund investors, more than 57 individuals earned more than $30 million and
more than 37 individuals earned more than $82 million. Again, this indicates a large increase in the very
top end of the income distribution.

C.

Mutual Funds

At the same time that alternative assets under management and their fees have grown
substantially, so have institutionally managed assets, particularly mutual funds. In this section, we
document the increase in assets under management and fees paid to mutual funds.
Table 5a shows that total assets under management at mutual funds have increased from $135
billion in 1980 to $2.16 trillion in 1994 to $8.9 trillion in 2005 with more than half of the assets in 2005
residing in equity mutual funds. The number of funds has grown from fewer than one thousand to almost
eight thousand.
Table 5b uses data from the 2006 Investment Company Institute Handbook to report the fees
including sales loads paid on these funds. The asset weighted percentage fees have declined over time,
driven by the increase in index funds and by the decrease in the use of sales loads. While the percentage
fees have declined, the huge increase in assets under management has lead to a substantial increase in
fees. Fees have increased from $1.3 billion in 1980 to $31.1 billion in 1995 to $73.1 billion in 2005. In
$2005, they have increased from $2.7 billion in 1980 to $37.9 billion in 1995 to $73.1 billion in 2005.7
Unfortunately, it is very difficult to measure the number of people involved in the mutual fund
industry and the pay distribution of those individuals. The fees are paid to investment managers as well
as to brokers and intermediaries who sell or distribute the mutual funds. Some of these individuals work
for the top securities firms and are already counted in the investment banking section. Rather than

7

Bogle (2005) makes a similar point.
27

provide inaccurate estimates, we simply conclude that there are likely many highly compensated
individuals in the mutual fund industry and that number has grown substantially since 1980.

IV.

Lawyers

We next look at the pay of top corporate lawyers. To do this we rely on American Lawyer
Magazine’s annual surveys of law firm revenues and compensation. In 1985, Am Law covered the top 50
firms (by revenue); in 1995, the top 100 firms (by revenue); and, in 2005, the top 200 firms. The Am
Law surveys are released mid-year and, therefore, reflect results for the previous calendar year. Table 6a,
therefore, summarizes the Am Law results for the calendar years 1984 (Am Law 50), 1994 (Am Law 100)
and 2004 (Am Law 200).
For the purpose of studying compensation, the current Am Law surveys report the average profit
per equity partner at each of the top law firms. Because law firms are typically structured as flow-through
entities for tax purposes, the profit an equity partner earns should appear as ordinary income to the partner
and will show up in the partner’s AGI. As a result, average profit per equity partner likely provides a
lower bound on the AGI of the average equity partner because it does not include non-law firm income
earned by the partner. Because law firms are typically structured as partnerships, equity partners do not
receive W-2’s and, therefore, will not show up in the distribution of W-2s.
In our analysis, we prefer to use profit per equity partner because those partners are the key
partners in the firms. According to the Am Law survey, equity partners are those who file a Schedule K-1
tax form and receive no more than half their compensation on a fixed-income basis. Non-equity partners
receive more than half of their compensation on a fixed-income basis. They are lawyers whom the firm
wants to retain, but who do not receive the same voting rights, decision rights, and compensation.
By 2004, most law firms distinguished between equity partners and non-equity partners, with the
median Am Law 100 firm having roughly one non-equity partner for each three equity partners. The
2004 Am Law numbers report profits per equity partner. For the 1984 Am Law 50, we use total partners
and profits per all partners. At that time, few firms, if any, had gone to the model of non-equity partners,

28

so these calculations represent primarily equity partners. In 1994, some firms had begun to appoint nonequity partners. As a result the Am Law 100 reports the number of equity and non-equity partners. The
median firm in the Am Law 100 had no non-equity partners. Unfortunately, the Am Law 100 only
reports profit per total partners not profits per equity partner. In our analysis, we report the number of
equity partners and profits per all partners for 1994. This slightly understates true profits per equity
partner, but likely not more than 10%. When we estimate profits per partner for the 56 firms that do not
have any non-equity partners, we obtain average (median) profits per partner that are 9.4% (5.7%) greater
than the profits per partner for all 100 firms.
Table 6a summarizes the data from the 1984, 1994, and 2004 Am Law surveys. The data exhibit
two strong patterns. First, a large number of law partners are in the top 0.5% and top 0.1% of the income
distribution in 2004. Second, both the compensation of law partners and the number of highly
compensated law partners have grown substantially over time.
Table 6a indicates that the average profits per partner in the top 50, top 100, and top 200 U.S. law
firms in 2004, respectively, were $1.26, $1.01 and $0.83 million. These averages are the averages of the
average profit per partner for each firm. The medians of the averages are lower, at $1.08, $0.86 and $0.67
million. These profits accrued to, respectively, 11,034, 17,861, and 26,755 partners. Average profits per
partner exceed $2 million for 9 firms; they are at least $0.5 million for 93 of the top 100 firms, and 152 of
the top 200 firms.
Because, the law firms do not make the profit distributions to individual partners known to the
public, it is impossible to know exactly how the payouts to individual partners are distributed around the
average profits per partner. Conversations with law partners suggest that the distribution is not so skewed
as the distribution of CEO and investment banker MD pay. In what follows, we make the following
distributional assumption. We assume that 1/3 of the partners earn more than the average while 2/3 of the
partners make less than the average. We assume that the most highly paid partner earns twice the average
while the least highly paid partner earns half the average. We base this distribution on conversations with
law partners at top firms. For some firms, the distribution is less skewed; for others, more skewed. Our

29

sense is that this captures the distribution on average. The bottom line of our results would not be very
different if we assumed a less skewed distribution.
Based on these distributions, we estimate that 14,351 of the 17,861 partners in the Am Law 100
earned more than $0.48 million in 2004. Table 6b indicates that these partners represent more than 2% of
the returns with AGI’s in the top 0.5% and top 0.1%.
If we extend the analysis to the Am Law 200, we estimate that another 4,246 lawyers earn more
than $0.48 million, bringing the total to over 18,000; and another 312 earn more than $1.4 million
bringing the total to 3,477.8 These figures imply that when the Am Law 200 firms are included, equity
partners comprise more than 2.6% of the AGI distribution above the top 0.5% and top 0.1%. When we
exclude investment income Am Law 200 partners comprise more than 4% of the top 0.1%.
It also is worth pointing out that the 26,000 plus equity partners at Am Law 200 firms earn a total
of roughly $22 billion (at $0.83 million per partner). This is the same order of magnitude as the total pay
to non-financial top executives, investment banking MDs, hedge fund investors, and PE and VC
investors.
Furthermore, table 6a indicates that lawyers have experienced a large real increase in pay over the
last 10 and 20 years. In 1984, the average profit per partner at the top 50 firms was $0.309 million or
$0.498 million in $2004. By 1994, the average profit per partner had increased to $0.531 million or
$0.636 in $2004. And by 2004, the average profit per partner at the top 50 firms had increased to $1.260
million.
The table also reports the AGI cutoffs for the top 0.5% and top 0.1% of the AGI distribution in
those three years. In 2004, AGI of $0.48 million and $1.40 million, respectively, were in the top 0.5%
and top 0.1% of the AGI distribution. In 1994, the analogous figures were $0.29 million and $0.73 M; in
1984, they were $0.16 million and $0.42 million. While the average profit per partner in 1984 and 1994

8

Because some of the partners of these law firms are based overseas, this overstates the true number of partners in
these brackets. It is impossible to know how large this effect is, both absolutely and compared to the overstatement
for top executives.
30

is close to the midpoint of the two cutoffs, the average profit per partner is much closer to the top 0.1% in
2004 suggesting that the average law partner is now at a higher point in the AGI distribution than before.
Table 6a also indicates that the number of partners has increased substantially going from an
average of 90 in 1984, to 155 in 1994 and to 221 in the top 50 firms in 2004. In the top 100 firms, the
average number of equity partners increased from an average of 130 in 1994 to 179 in 2004.
Table 6b shows the effect of the increase in equity partners and compensation per partner by
comparing the contribution of the equity partners to the top AGI brackets in the different years. The table
indicates that the equity partners at top law firms have markedly increased their presence in the top
income brackets. In 1984, Am Law 50 partners represented 0.50% of the top 0.5% and 1.06% of the top
0.1%. These increased to 0.90% and 0.97%, respectively, in 1994, and to 1.50% and 2.05% in 2004.
Am Law 100 partners comprised 1.46% of the top 0.5% and 1.30% of the top 0.1% AGI brackets in
1994. This increased to 2.17% and 2.39%, respectively, in 2004.
Overall then, the representation of top corporate lawyers in the top 0.5% and top 0.1% AGI
brackets has increased substantially over time.

V.

Professional Athletes

In this section, we look at the pay of professional athletes. To do this, we collect compensation
information on professional baseball, football, and basketball players in the U.S. These three sports are
among the most popular in the U.S. and include a relatively large number of athletes.
We obtain baseball compensation information for 1984 to 2005 from the “Business of Baseball”
website (http://roadsidephotos.sabr.org/baseball/data.htm) and from USA Today for 2005. We obtain
basketball and football compensation information from Professor Rodney Fort of Washington State
University (http://www.rodneyfort.com/PHSportsEcon/Common/OtherData/DataDirectory.html). Fort
credits sports statistician Patricia Bender for the basketball information from 1991-2000, and the USA
Today site for information from 2001-present. He obtained the football information from USA Today

31

and Sports Illustrated. These figures understate AGI because they only include income earned from the
athlete’s team and, therefore, do not include any income from endorsements and other sources
Table 7 describes the extent to which those professional athletes are represented in the top end of
AGI distributions for 1995 and 2004. The level of pay has increased substantially with the average
athlete earning $1.85 million in 2004 versus $0.78 million in 1995. The table also indicates that the
athletes represent roughly the same percentage of the top 0.1%, but a larger percentage of the top 0.01%
AGI bracket in 2004 than they did in 1995. In 1995 and 2004, the athletes in baseball, football and
basketball represented 0.8% of the returns in the top 0.1%. At the same time, the athletes represented
1.0% of the returns in the top 0.01% in 1995, but 1.5% of the returns in the top 0.01% in 2004.
The table also shows that in total, the 3400 plus athletes earned just over $6.3 billion in 2004.
This sum is substantially smaller than the sums going to the other groups we have analyzed.
Over this period, then, professional athletes increased their pay substantially, maintained or
increased their share of the top brackets, but represented a small fraction of those very top brackets.

VI.

Contributions to top end of the income distribution

In this section, we attempt to aggregate the results from the previous section to see how many
individuals we can identify at the very top end of the income distribution.
To summarize, we have estimated the number of high income individuals who are top executives
at public companies, highly compensated investment bankers, hedge fund investors, VC investors, PE
investors, lawyers and professional athletes. Table 8a presents a summary of the individuals that we
count in each category for the top fractiles – from top 0.5% to top 0.0001% -- of the earnings distribution
in 2004. Table 8a also includes the estimated earnings of the individuals in the Forbes Celebrity 100 in
2004. The table does not include estimates of the number of highly paid individuals at mutual funds and
other institutional money managers. As a result, we believe that the estimates in these tables understate
the individuals in our groups that are in the top brackets.

32

In table 8a, we use the ExecuComp data on realized pay and our estimates for the nonExecuComp executives to populate the top brackets for non-financial and financial executives. We use
the exponential-based estimates of the distribution of investment banker income. For hedge fund
investors, we use an average compensation of 3.2% of assets under management and estimate an average
of $3.2 million in compensation per 9,000 highly compensated employees. We assume that all 9,000
have AGI above $0.48 million (top 0.5%) and 1/3 or 3,000 have AGI above $1.4 million (top 0.1%). We
use Trader Monthly and the II Alpha 25 for the very top end of the hedge fund distribution. We almost
certainly underestimate the number of hedge fund investors in the top 0.01% ($7.2 million) because the
Trader Monthly and II Alpha lists do not report enough hedge fund investor incomes to go below $12
million. For VC investors, we assume an average compensation of 4.0% of assets under management and
estimate an average of $1.8 million (the midpoint of the $1.3 to $2.3 million range) in compensation per
6,000 partners. We assume that all 6,000 partners have AGI above $0.48 million and 1/5 or 1,200 have
AGI above $1.4 million. For PE investors, under the 4.0% assumption, we estimate an average of $2.8
million in compensation per 5,400 partners. We assume that all 5,400 have AGI above $0.48 million and
2/5 or 2,160 have AGI above $1.4 million. For VC and PE, we do not try to make any assumptions for
incomes above the top 0.01%. We do recognize that at least three PE investors – Kravis, Roberts and
Schwarzman – earned at least $101 million and were in the top 0.0001% bracket. We use the
distributions calculated earlier for law partners and professional athletes.
Table 8a indicates that our groups comprise at least 9.1% of those in the top 0.5% AGI bracket,
about 20% of those in the top 0.01% bracket, and approximately 26.5% of those in the very top 0.0001%
bracket.
Including financial top executives, investment bankers, hedge funds, VC investors, and PE
investors, we count more than twice as many Wall Street individuals as Main Street individuals (nonfinancial top executives) in the top 0.5% and the top 0.1% of the AGI distribution.
We also estimate that financial top executives, investment bankers, and hedge fund investors
comprise a greater fraction of the top 0.01%, a similar fraction of the top 0.001% and a substantially

33

greater fraction of the top 0.0001% than the top Main Street individuals. Including VC investors, PE
investors, mutual fund investors, and measuring hedge fund investors more accurately would almost
certainly tip the fraction in favor of Wall Street for the top 0.001% as well.
When we estimate AGI brackets excluding investment income, our groups explain a larger
fraction of the top groups, particularly the top 0.01%. Our groups comprise almost 10% of the top 0.5%,
22.2% of the top 0.1%, almost 33% of the top 0.01% and more than 26% of the top 0.001%. We are
unable to do this calculation for the top 0.0001%.
Table 8b takes an alternative look at our different groups. It summarizes the dollar amounts of
AGI and fees of our various groups and how they have changed over time. The AGI of the non-financial
executives in ExecuComp in 2004 is $34 billion. This has increased in real terms by a factor of 2.6 times
from $12.9 billion ($10.7 billion nominal).
Using the exponential distribution, we estimate that investment bankers earned a total of $28.4
billion in 2004. Because of data availability issues, we are unable to estimate total compensation in 1994.
Fees to hedge funds investors totaled $25.4 million in 2004, an increase in real terms by a factor
over 7 times relative to 1994. Fees to PE funds and VC funds totaled $18.4 billion and $10.9 billion in
2004. These represent increases in real terms by factors of 3.9 and 6.8 times respectively relative to 1994.
Estimated fees to mutual funds increased by 1.9 times in real terms from 1995 to 2004 after having
increased by 4.6 times from 1985 to 1995.
Law partners at the Am Law 100 earned a total of $18.1 billion in 2004, representing an increase
in real profits of 2.6 times relative to 1994, virtually identical to the increase to top non-financial
executives.
While it is not possible to map all of these results into changes in the income distribution, these
results again strongly suggest that Wall Street and legal professionals have contributed at least as much as
and probably more than top executives of non-financial public companies to the widening of the income
distribution.

34

VII.

Pay-for-Performance

Some critics of CEO and top executive pay point not only to the high levels of pay, but also argue
that those executives are not paid for performance. For example, Bebchuk and Fried (2005) argue that
CEO compensation schemes “weaken managers’ incentives to increase firm value and even create
incentives to take actions that reduce long-term reduce long-term reduce firm value.” They and others
have led some to conclude that there is no link between top executive pay and firm performance. The
compensation of top executives is often contrasted with that of hedge fund, VC, and PE investors who are
supposedly highly paid for performance.
In this section, we provide evidence on the relation between firm performance and CEO
compensation. We also discuss the extent to which hedge fund, VC, and PE investors are paid for
performance.
First, we use the ExecuComp database to compare the amount of compensation the CEOs
actually receive – realized compensation or TDC2 – to the company performance over the previous one,
three, and five years. Each year from 1999 to 2004, we sort the ExecuComp firms into five groups based
on beginning of year book assets. We do this because it is well-known that compensation varies with
firm size. (See Gabaix and Landier (2006)). Within each size group, we sort the CEOs into five groups
based on realized compensation from lowest to highest. For each firm-year, we measure performance as
the total return to the firm’s stock less the value-weighted performance of the firm’s industry (using
Fama-French industry returns). We then compare performance across the different compensation-size
groups.
Figure 3 reports the results graphically for the three previous years of stock performance. Within
each size quintile, actual compensation is highly related to performance, i.e., there is strong pay-forperformance. Firms with the CEOs in the top 20% of compensation outperform their industries by an
average of 61%. Firms with CEOs in the bottom 20% of compensation underperform their industries by
an average of 19%. The results are qualitatively identical for one year and five years of stock
performance.

35

We suspect some of the confusion over pay is that critics focus on ex ante or estimated pay rather
than realized pay. Because much of realized pay reflects the exercise of in-the-money options, CEOs will
tend to receive large payoffs whenever their firms’ stock has increased substantially. It is not surprising
that most large payoffs result from strong stock performance. Estimates in Bebchuk and Grinstein (2005)
imply that at least 1/2 of the expected value of CEO compensation has been equity-based since 1996.
It also is worth mentioning that CEO turnover has increased over time as has the relation of CEO
turnover to poor performance. (See Kaplan and Minton (2006)). Those results suggest that boards do
hold CEOs accountable for poor performance, providing CEOs additional incentives to perform.
It is interesting to compare top executive compensation to hedge fund, VC, and PE investor
compensation. As mentioned earlier, all three types of investors receive compensation that is a
combination of a fixed annual management fee and a variable share of profits, usually 20%. These
option-like payoffs imply that compensation of hedge fund, VC, and PE investors is strongly related to
performance if the performance is positive, but is unrelated to performance if the performance is poor. In
other words, hedge fund, VC, and PE fund investors can earn a lot of money even with mediocre or even
poor performance. Estimates in Metrick and Yasuda (2007) suggest that the performance-based
component – the profit share or carried interest – of VCs and PE investors represents less than 40% of the
expected present value of compensation.
Although the compensation of these different groups is not directly comparable, it is not obvious
that CEO pay is any less related to performance than that of hedge fund, VC, and PE investors.

VIII.

Summary and Implications

We have attempted to measure how much of the inequality today at the top end of the income
distribution can be attributed to different sectors of the economy – top executives of non-financial firms
(Main Street); financial service sector employees from investment banks, hedge funds, VC funds, PE
funds, and mutual funds (Wall Street); lawyers; and professional athletes. We also have estimated how
those contributions have varied over time.

36

Studying these groups, we believe we are able to identify at least 15% to 26.5% of the individuals
who comprise the AGI categories at and above the top 0.1%. We estimate that CEOs and top executives
of non-financial public companies comprise fewer than half of these individuals and do not comprise
more than 6.4% of any of the top AGI brackets. Individuals we characterize as Wall Street professionals
comprise a greater a fraction of the top end of the distribution than the top five executives of “Main
Street” public companies.
We believe our assumptions are generally conservative and, therefore, these groups – particularly
the non-executive groups – may represent a larger fraction of the very top than we are able to report.
Nevertheless, even under less conservative assumptions, we doubt those groups could possibly explain
more than 40% of the very top categories. While our estimates represent a substantial portion of the top
income groups, they clearly miss a large number of high-earning individuals. This seems strongly
inconsistent with the claim in Dew-Becker and Gordon (2005) that CEOs, celebrities, and athletes explain
most of the top end of the distribution. We suspect that some of the missing individuals are trial lawyers,
executives of privately-held companies, and independently wealthy individuals who have a high AGI.
We also find that the representation of the top executives in the top AGI brackets has increased
only modestly from 1994 to 2004, particularly using ex ante compensation. Using realized compensation,
top executives comprise roughly the same fraction of the top 0.1% of the AGI distribution in 2004 as they
did in 1994 and a somewhat higher fraction of the top 0.01% (5.3% in 2004 versus 3.9% in 1994). Using
ex ante compensation, top executives comprise a slightly lower fraction of the top 0.1% (3.32% versus
3.55%) and a slightly higher fraction of the top 0.01% (3.93% versus 3.65%) in 2004 than they did in
1994. In contrast, the contributions of hedge fund managers, private equity investors, venture capital
investors, and corporate lawyers have clearly increased substantially over the past 10 and 20 years, likely
by a greater amount than the top executives.
These results inform some of the different explanations for the increased skewness at the top end
of the income distribution. As mentioned earlier, these explanations include trade theories (Hecksher
(1931), Olin (1933), Stolper and Samuelson (1941)), skill biased technological change (Katz and Murphy

37

(1992)), increasing returns to generalists rather than specialists (Murphy and Zabojnik (2004), Frydman
(2005)), stealing theories (Bebchuk and Fried (2004) and Bebchuk and Grinstein (2005)), social norms
(Piketty and Saez (2006a) and Levy and Temin(2007)), greater scale (Gabaix and Landier (2006)), and
the economics of superstars (Rosen (1981) which posits technological advance as an explanation for
greater scale.
We believe our results are not well-explained by trade theories, increasing returns to generalists,
stealing theories, and social norms.
The trade theories predict that the increase in inequality will be greater among individuals or
groups in industries that are most engaged in trade. It seems unlikely that trade theories can account for
the increase in inequality at the top levels of the income distribution given the breadth of the phenomenon
across the occupations we study. In particular, it seems difficult for trade to explain the increase in the
top end of VC investors, PE investors, and, particularly, lawyers and professional athletes. For example,
it is difficult to understand how trade has increased the pay of U.S. lawyers (most of whose human capital
is country-specific) by a factor of four over the last twenty years..
The theory of increasing returns to generalists predicts an increased return to those with generalist
skills, and has been proffered as one explanation for the increase in CEO and top executive pay. We
think the types of occupations responsible for some of the increase in the top end of the income
distribution are not consistent with this theory. In particular, we do not believe that lawyers, hedge fund
investors, investment bankers, or professional athletes have become less specialized / more general over
time. In fact, the opposite seems more likely to be true.
The stealing theories argue that corporate governance deteriorated in the last ten years to such an
extent that CEOs and top executives have been able to increase their compensation substantially through
what amounts to stealing. CEOs (and top executives) are the only one of the groups we study who some
argue can set their own pay without competitive negotiation. While we do not test directly whether any
group of individuals is stealing or not, our evidence suggests that stealing CEOs or poor corporate
governance cannot possibly be more than a small part of the picture of increasing income inequality, even

38

at the very upper end of the distribution. First, other groups that are not in a position to steal have
experienced equal or larger increases in their contribution to the top AGI brackets. Second, top
executives occupy roughly the same part of the top AGI brackets in 2004 as they did in 1994 using ex
ante compensation – the amount that boards of directors expect to pay. Third, the top executives
represent less than 6.4% of any of the top AGI brackets (using realized pay) and CEOs represent less than
5% of any of the top brackets. Fourth, realized top executive compensation (as measured by TDC2) is
strongly related to a company’s stock performance.
Our evidence also is hard to reconcile with the arguments in Piketty and Saez (2006a) and Levy
and Temin (2007) that the increase in pay at the top is driven by the recent removal of social norms
regarding pay inequality. Piketty and Saez (2006a) suggest that “impediments to free markets due to
labor market regulations, unions, or social norms regarding pay inequality can keep executive pay below
market. Such impediments have been largely removed in the United States, but still exist in Europe and
Japan.” Levy and Temin (2007) emphasize the importance of Federal government policies towards
unions, income taxation and the minimum wage. We do not think our evidence is favorable towards a
central role for social norms. While top executive pay has increased, so has the pay of other groups,
particularly Wall Street groups, who are and were less subject to disclosure and, arguably, less subject to
social norms. In addition, the compensation arrangements at hedge funds, VC funds, and PE funds of a
2% management fee and 20% profit share have not changed much, if at all, in the last twenty-five years
(see Sahlman (1990), Gompers and Lerner (1999), and Metrick and Yasuda (2007)). Furthermore, it is
not clear how greater unionization would have suppressed the pay of those on Wall Street. In other
words, there is no evidence of a change in social norms on Wall Street. What has changed is the amount
of money managed and the concomitant amount of pay.
We believe that our evidence remains more favorable toward the theories of skill-biased
technological change, greater scale and superstars.
Skill biased technological change predicts that inequality will increase if technological progress
raises the productivity of skilled workers relative to unskilled workers and / or raises the price of goods

39

made by skilled workers relative to those made by unskilled workers. For example, computers and
advances in information technology may complement skilled labor and substitute for unskilled labor.
This seems likely to provide part of the explanation for the increase in pay of professional athletes
(technology increases their marginal product by allowing them to reach more consumers) and Wall Street
investors (technology allows them to acquire information and trade large amounts more easily and
efficiently).
Gabaix and Landier (2006) argue that the wage differential between the best and next best CEO
for a firm will reflect the talent differential between the two multiplied by the size of the firm. In
equilibrium, CEOs and top executives will be paid more as their firms and the other firms they can work
for become larger. In other words, the larger size increases the returns to hiring the more productive
people. As long as other firms are also large, competition for talent will drive wages up. This theory is
not necessarily specific to CEOs and top executives.
While we do not test the Gabaix and Landier (2006) theory directly, our results are arguably
consistent with it. Gabaix and Landier point out that U.S. public companies have grown larger over time,
with the typical large firm increasing in market value by four to seven times in real terms from 1980 to
2003. In our analysis, we find that financial services firms, VC funds, PE funds, hedge funds, and law
firms all have grown larger, in many instances by orders of magnitude. For example, the typical law firm
in the Am Law 50 has increased revenues by six times in real terms from 1984 to 2004. Similarly, the
total amount of capital per employee at the top 50 firms in the securities industry has increased by almost
nine times in real terms from 1987 to 2004.
Our results also are consistent with Rosen (1981) who argues that technological change,
particularly in information and communications, can increase the relative productivity of superstars or
talented individuals. Rosen’s theory can be viewed as a combination of the previous two explanations in
that the individuals and firms who benefit from the technological change are likely to get larger. It is
worth noting that Gabaix and Landier do not explain why firms (and funds) have been able to become so
much larger over time. The same technological change that is biased towards skills may have helped

40

firms and funds to become larger during our sample period.

This table shows the distribution of total compensation for executives in Execucomp relative to the distribution of AGI income. Only the top 5 executives in terms of TDC2 are counted for each Execucomp
company. Financial firms are defined as firms that have an SIC code between 6000 and 6299, which includes depository institutions, nondepositorycredit institutions, and securities and commodities brokers.
Percentilesare shown relative to the number of tax filers. The cutoffs for the top fractiles of AGI income in 1994 are calculated based on the detailed IRS Statistics of Income files for US individuals, held at the
NBER. The cutoffs for the top fractiles of AGI income in 2004 are calculated based on the 2002 distribution (the latest years for which the detailed files are available) and the relation between the 2002 and
2004 fractiles documented in the tabulations of Piketty and Saez (2003, 2006).

This table shows the estimated distribution of total compensation for top 5 executives of companies not in the Execucomp database, relative to the distribution of AGI income. Non-Execucomp counts were
obtained by sampling the disclosure documents of non-Execucomp firms in 1994 and 2004, and then scaling to the number of non-Execucomp firms in the universe. See note to Table 1a for details on the
computation of the income fractile thresholds and the definition of financial versus non-financial firms.

This table shows the distribution of total compensation for executives relative to the distribution of AGI income. Only the top 5 executives in terms of TDC2 are counted for each Execucomp company. NonExecucomp counts were obtained by samplingthe disclosure documents of non-Execucomp firms in 1994 and 2004, and then scaling to the number of non-Execucomp firms in the universe. Financial firms are defined
as firms that have an SIC code between 6000 and 6299, which includes depository institutions, nondepository credit institutions,and securitiesand commodities brokers. Percentiles are shown relative to the number of
tax filers. The cutoffs for the top fractiles of AGI income in 1994 are calculated based on the detailed IRS Statistics of Income files for US individuals, held at the NBER. The cutoffs for the top fractiles of AGI
income in 2004 are calculated based on the 2002 distribution (the latest years for which the detailed files are available)and the relation between the 2002 and 2004 fractiles documented in the tabulations of Piketty and
Saez (2003, 2006). Non-investment income is AGI excluding dividends, interest income, rental income, farm income, IRA distributions, income from estates and trusts, pension and annuity distributions, long term
capital gains, and Form 4797 income.

This table reports the estimated distributions of pay for 10,000 managing alongside AGI brackets. Based on industry information, the figures assume that essentially no managing
director of a top 10 investment bank earned less than $500,000 in 2004. Two possible distributions of pay are considered. The first is a pareto distribution with a minimum value of
$500,000, estimated so that 25% of managing directors earn more than $2.5 million and truncated at $35 million, the highest payout observed for an investment banking employee in
2004. The second distribution is an exponential distribution, which we censor below at $500,000 and calibrate so that only one employee earns more than $25 million. The middle
pair of columns presents the percent of each bracket accounted for by every 10,000 managing directors, and the right-most pair presents the number of individuals earning at least the
minimum bracket amount for every 10,000 managing directors.

This table reports assets under management at hedge funds and number of hedge funds over time as reported by the Hennessee Group, Hedge Fund Research, and TASS. Hedge
fund fees are calculated in two ways, assuming annual management fees of 2% and profit share of 20% using Hennessee Group assets under management. First, hedge fund fees are
calculated using the average returns for the year and assuming that all funds earn the average return. Second, hedge fund fees are calculated assuming that fees equal 2%
management fee and that the profit share leads to fees of 1.2% per year based on a Black-Scholes calculation with expected volatility of 11% and a risk-free rate of 3%.

This table reports annual capital commitments to, number of funds raised in, and average annual returns of Venture Capital (VC) and Private Equity (PE) from 1980 to 2005 using Thomson Financial's Venture Economics
database. Money under management is calculated as the sum of capital commitments over the last seven years including the current year. Estimated fees are calculated using the money under management at the beginning of
the year, average returns for the year, and assuming that all funds earn the average return.

Financial World rankings include all financial industry individuals and employees, including private equity and hedge funds. Trader Monthly rankings include
traders and hedge fund professionals only, and Alpha rankings are for hedge fund professionals only. Alpha figures are released later and for this reason when
there is conflicting information about a given individual's earnings, Alpha numbers are used. Inflation adjustments for the counts of 1988 in $2004 and 1995 in
$2004 are performed using the GDP deflator.

This table reports revenues, lawyers, equity partners and profits per partner for law firms from the American Lawyer magazine, AmLaw top law firms for calendar years 1984, 1994, and 2004. In each cell,
average is reported above medians. When converted, 1984 and 1994 dollars are converted into 2004 dollars using the GDP Implicit Price Deflator. In 1984, we assume that all partners are equity partners, so
profits per equity partner equals profit per partner. In 1994, firms began to appoint non-equity partners. The median firm had no non-equity partners. For 1994, we report the number of equity partners and profits
per all partners. This sligtly understates true proifts per equity partner. In 2004, ALM distinguished between profits per equity and total partners.

This table estimates the number of equity partners at the Am Law top law firms in the top 0.5% and 0.1% AGI brackets in 1984, 1994, and 2004. For each law firm, the
estimates that 1/3 of the partners earn more than the average while 2/3 of the partners earn less than the average. The estimates assume that the most highly paid partner
earns twice the average while the least highly paid partner earns half the average.

This table uses the ExecuComp data and our estimates of the non-ExecuComp companies to populate the top brackets for executives of non-financial and financial
companies. It uses estimated 2004 brackets for the top 0.5%, 0.1%, 0.01%, and 0.001%, and it uses the 2001 AGI cutoff for the top 0.0001% bracket due to data
availability. It assumes the exponential-based estimates of the distribution of investment banker income. For hedge fund investors, the figures in the table assume an
average compensation of 3.2% of assets under management; that all 9,000 have AGI above $0.5 million (top 0.5%); and that 1/3 or 3,000 have AGI above $1.4 million
(top 0.1%). For the very top end of the hedge fund distribution, the figures rely on the numbers in Tables 4a and 4b, which are based on Trader Monthly and the II
Alpha 25. For VC investors, we assume an average compensation of 4.0% of assets under management; that all 6,000 partners have AGI above $0.5 million; and that
1/5 or 1,200 have AGI above $1.4 million. For PE investors, under the same 4.0% assumption, we assume that all 5,400 have AGI above $0.5 million and 2/5 or 2,160
have AGI above $1.4 million. For VC and PE, we do not try to make any assumptions for incomes above the top 0.01%. We use the distributions calculated earlier for
law partners and professional athletes.

The table summarizes the dollar amounts of AGI and fees of the various groups and how they have changed over time. 1984 Hedge funds use 1986 estimates. 1994
Professional Athletes use 1995 estimates. 1994 and 1984 mutual funds use 1995 and 1985 estimates. 1984 Am Law 100 estimated as two times 1984 Am Law 50
Partners. AGI to investment bankers for 2004 comes from the assumptions in Table 2b; for 1984 we scale the 2004 value down by the ratio of 1987 capital per
employee to 2004 capital per employee.
