Patents as Options: Some Estimates of
the Value of Holding European Patent Stocks
ABSTRACT

In many countries holders of patents must pay an annual renewal fee in

order to keep their patents in force. This paper uses data on the proportion
of patents renewed, and the renewal fees faced by, post World War II cohorts of
patents in France, the United Kingdom, and Germany, in conjunction with a model

of patent holders' renewal decisions, to estimate the returns earned from

holding patents in these countries. Since patents are often applied for at an
early stage in the innovation process, the model allows agents to be uncertain
about the sequence of returns that will be earned if the patent is kept in
force. Formally, then, the paper presents and solves a discrete choice
optimal stochastic control model, derives the implications of the model on
aggregate behaviour, and then estimates the parameters of the model from

aggregate data. The estimates enable a detailed description of the evolution
of the distribution of returns earned from holding patents over their lifespans,
and calculations of both; the annual returns earned from holding the patents
still in force (or the patent stocks) in the alternative countries, and the
distribution of the discounted value of returns earned from holding the patents
in a cohort.

In many countries holders of patents must pay an annual renewal fee in

order to keep their patents in force. If the renewal fee is not paid in any
single year, the patent is permanently cancelled. Assuming that renewal
decisions are based on economic criteria, agents will only renew their patents
if the value of holding those patents over an additional year exceeds the cost

of renewal. Observations on the proportions of different cohorts of patents
which are renewed at alternative ages, together with the relevant renewal fee
schedules, will, in this case, contain information on the distribution of the
values of holding patents, and on the evolution of this distribution function

over the lifespan of the patents. Since patent rights are seldom marketed, this
is one of the few sources of information on the value of patents available.
This paper presents and then estimates a model which recovers the distribution
of returns from holding patents at each age over the lifespan of patents from
data on the renewal behaviour of, and the renewal fee schedules faced by, post
World War II cohorts of patents in each of the United Kingdom, France, and
Germany (renewal fees were not instituted in the United States until 1982).
The parameters of these distribution functions enable a calculation of; the
value, to patent holders, of the proprietary rights created

by the patent laws;

the distribution of this value among patents; and the process which determines

the evolution of the value of patents over their lifespans.
This is not the first time patent renewal data has been used to estimate

parameters of the distribution of patent values. In a previous paper (see Pakes
and Schankerinan, 19?8) intercountry differences in the proportion of patents

renewed and in renewal fee schedules faced by cohorts

of European patents were

used to estimate the rate of obsolescence on the returns from holding patents.
The earlier paper assumed that cohorts of patents were endowed with a

distribution of initial current returns which

decayed deterministically

thereafter. Methodologically, the major innovation in this paper is that it

—2—

does not assume that the sequence of returns that will accrue to the patent if
it is to be kept in force are known with certainty at the time the patent is

applied for. The generalization to an uncertain sequence of returns is to allow
for the fact that agents often apply for patents at an early stage in the
innovation process, a stage in which the agent is still exploring alternative

opportunities for earning returns from use of the information embodied in the

patented ideas. In part early patenting arises from the incentive structure
created by the patent system, since, if the agent does riot patent the
information available to him

,

somebody else might. This incentive is

reinforced by the fact that the renewal fees in all countries studied are quite
small during the early ages of a patent's life.

A patent holder who pays the renewal fee obtains both; the current returns
that accrue to the patent over the coming period, and the option to pay the
renewal fee and maintain the patent in force in the following period should he

desire to do so. An agent who acts optimally will pay the renewal fee
only if the sum of the current returns plus the value of this option exceeds the
renewal fee.

It will be assumed that the agent values the option at the

expected discounted value of future net returns (current returns minus renewal
fees), taking account of the fact that an optimal policy will be followed in

each future period, and conditional on the information currently at the disposal

of the agent. Current decisions, therefore, depend on both current returns, and
on the distribution of future returns conditional on current information. An

optimal sequential policy for the agent has the form of an optimal renewal (or
stopping) rule; a rule determining whether to pay the renewal at each age. The
proportion of patents who drop Out at age a are the proportion who do not
satisfy the renewal criteria at that age, but who did at age a—i. The drop Out

proportions

predicted by the model will be a function of the precise value of

—3--

the vector of the model's parameters, and of the renewal fee schedules. The
data provide the actual proportion of drop outs. Roughly speaking, the estimation
problem is to find that value of the vector of the model's parameters which
makes the drop out proportions implied by the model as "close" as possible to
those we actually observe.

Formally then, this paper presents and solves a dynamic discrete choice
optimal stochastic control model, derives the implications of this model on

aggregate behaviour, and then estimates the parameters of the model from aggregate

data. Dynamic discrete choice models have appeared in the economic literature
in several contexts (see for eg. Roberts and Weitznian, 1981); and a small number

of them have actually been estimated on micro data. Miller (1982) estimates
such a model for the length of job matches, and Wolpin (1982) estimates one for

the birth sequences of married women. All three of these models have a range of
applications and provide an extremely rich interpretation to the data. They are
each, however, based on quite different stochastic specifications (and rightly
so given the diversity of the empirical problems they deal with) and, due to the
complexity of the estimation problem, it is difficult to determine the

robustness of the conclusions to the particular stochastic assumptions chosen.
The model used here embeds a Markov assumption, an assumption that the
distribution of the next period's return conditional on current information
depends only on current returns and the parameters of the problem, in a search

model with three types of outcomes. Each year the agents perform experiments to
explore alternative ways of best exploiting their patented ideas. One possible
outcome of these experiments is that they provide no new information

,

another

is that they determine that the patented ideas can never be profitably

exploited, and the third is that the experiments indicate a use which allows the
agent to increase the returns which accrue to the patent at subsequent ages.
The conditional distribution of beneficial outcomes, should they occur, is not

—4—

assumed, a priori, to be stationary over ages. This non—stationarity is to
allow for the possibility that agents explore their most promising alternatives

first; a possibility which is distinctly favored by the data. In addition, s:ince
there is a statutory limit to patent lives (an age beyond which the agent cannot
keep the patent in force by payment of an annual fee), the model has a finite
horizon.

Given our assumptions, it is possible to obtain an explicit solution for
the renewal rule as a function of the parameters of the Markov process, the age

of the patent, and the renewal fee schedules. However, the model is not as
benevolent with respect to the calculation of the aggregate drop Out probabilities.
To allow for heterogeneity, it is assumed that there is a distribution of initial

returns among patents. This distribution is modified over time as agents uncover
more profitable ways of exploiting their patented ideas. The distribution of
returns at each age does not have, to the best of my knowledge, an analytical
form, and, as a consequence, neither do the drop out probabilities.

I therefore

resort to the simulated frequency approach, suggested by Let-man and Manski (1981),

to estimate these probabilities for different values of the parameter vector.
The assumptions of the nxDdel, together with the parameter estimates, enable

a detailed description of the evolution of the distribution of the current

returns earned from holding patents over their lifespans. This information
is used to characterize the learning process and to calculate both; the annual
returns earned from holding the patents still in force (or the patent stocks) in
the alternative countries, and the distribution of the discounted values of

returns earned from holding the patents in a cohort. I consider more general
aspects of the empirical results, those related to modelling the inventive
process and to the private value generated by the patent system, in the final
section of the paper.

Section 1 provides an overview of the model, while Section 2 fills in the

specific details of its stochastic specification. Section 3 provides a
description of how the parameter estimates are actually obtained. The data is
described in Section 4. and Section 5 presents and interprets the parameter

estimates. Section 6, which closes the paper, provides a brief discussion of
some more general implications of the empirical results. An accompanying
appendix, which has three parts, deals with different technical points that
arise in the course of obtaining the parameter estimates.

Section 1. A Description of the Model

This section provides an overview of the renewal model used in this paper.
It begins by considering the decision problem faced by an agent who holds a
patent, and ends with the likelihood function implied by our assumptions.

The agent's problem is to decide on whether to pay a renewal fee

which will keep the patent in force over the coming year. If the renewal fee is
not paid, the patent is permanently cancelled. If the renewal fee is paid and
the age of the patent is less than the statutory limit to patent lives, the

agent will face a similar problem at the beginning of the next year. If the
patent's age equals the statutory limit to patent lives, the current is the last
year the agent can keep the patent in force by payment of a renewal fee.

Agents are asssumed to maximize the expected discounted value of the net
returns from their actions, and may be uncertain about the sequence of returns

that will be earned if the patent is kept in force. This uncertainty allows for
the possibility that, at least during the early years of a patent's life, the
agent is actively exploring alternative ways to best exploit the ideas embodied

in the patent. An implication is that there is a positive probability that the

will discover a use for the patented ideas which makes future returns to

agent

patent

protection significantly higher than those being currently earned, and

this probability may induce the agent to pay the current renewal fee even if
current returns are lower than the cost of renewal.

Let Via be the expected discounted value of patent protection to the
holder of the jth patent just prior to its athl renewal. If the renewal fee is

not paid the patent lapses and v

=
a

0.

If the renewal fee is paid the agent

earns the current return to patent protection and, in addition, maintains the
option to renew and keep the patent in force at age a + 1.

The value of this

option to the agent equals the expected discounted value of the patent at age

a +

conditional on

the agent's current information set.

r

If this expression is negative, the agent will allow the patent to lapse.
To complete the description of the value function we need to specify the
conditional distributions of future returns and costs of renewal that are held

by the agent. Given these distributions, the solution for the sequence

These assumptions simplify the analysis considerably. A2 was motivated by
the fact that the renewal fee schedules are published data, and though these

schedules are changed periodically, the real renewal fee at any age does not
vary much with the year the patent reaches that age. I will assume an

Al assumes that the stochastic process generating

subsequent sections (i.e. generating {r. }L2) is both Markov, and invariant
over i.

It should be noted that, in addition to Al and A2, the proofs of the

propositions required for our estimation technique use both the empirical fact
that all renewal fee schedules are nondecreasing in age (see section 4), and the

precise functional form of {G(' I)}' (see the next section). For an
understanding of the general characteristics of the model, however, we need only

point out two properties of this sequence of distribution functions. First the
probability that the coining year's returns will be greater than a given number

is higher the larger are current returns; or if

Second, though the

solution to the agents decision problem provided in this section does require

certain restrictions on the evolution of the sequence of conditional

distributions, of G(• •), over age (see the next section), it does not
require stationarity. This non—stationarity of the stochastic process

generating {r} turns Out to be an important feature of the empirical results.
Note that Al and A2 imply that the expected value of the option to renew
the patent at age a +

depends only on current returns (r.), the parameters

of the Markov process generating future returns

The system in (1) can therefore be rewritten as

omitted for convenience; for a=l, ..., L—l, and r c R+. B(a,r) provides the
total benefits from holding the patent for an additional year (the sum of

current returns and the value of the option).
The solution to the agents decision problem follo%.s directly from the

properties of this benefit function. These properties are provided in the
following proposition, and explained immediately thereafter.

Proposition 1 (proved in Appendix 1). The value of the option, that is
B(a,r) —

r,

is; uniformly continuous and nondecreasirig in r, and is

nonincreasing in a, for rc R+ and a=1,...,L,

Figure 1 illustrates the form of B(a,r). Since V(a+l, r) ' 0 with probability one, the expected value of the option to renew is nonnegative and B(a,r) )
r (the 45 degree line); while the fact that the probability that future returns
will be above a given number is larger the higher are current returns implies
that the value of the option [the difference between B(a,r) and the 45 degree

line] is nondecreasing in r. As the patent ages there are less future years in
which the patent can earn returns, and renewal fees rise. Either of these
facts is, in general, sufficient to insure that B(a,r) —

r

decreases in age.

Note that though B(a,r) is continuous in r everywhere, there are points at which
it is not differentiable in r (see Appendix 3).
Equation (2) implies that it is in the agent's interest to pay the renewal

fee if B(a,r) > Ca The following corollary of proposition 1 provides an optimal
renewal (or stopping) rule for the agent.

Corollary 1 (proved in Appendix I and illustrated in Figure 1). For each age

tection in the future. This is one difference between a myopic model, wherein
returns decay deterministically over time and an agent would not renew unless

ra > c , and the stochastic model. It can be shown that the difference between
a

the renewal fee and the cutoff, i.e.

is nondecreasing in the current

renewal fee (c), nonincreasing in the renewal fees for later ages (C+ ,

and, at least in the later ages, nonincreasing in age (since L is the last year

The fact that the renewal fees

are increasing in age, while B(a,r) is decreasing, implies that the cutoffs

are nondecreasing in age. Clearly the cutoffs are functions of; age, Sag' and

r(a, a g) for a =

L.

It is now straightforward, at least conceptually, to determine the proportion of patents who drop out, that is who stop paying the renewal fee, at each

age. First note that the distribution of initial returns [which we denote by
F1(r; w1)J, the stochastic process generating subsequent returns (Al), the
renewal fee schedules, and the renewal rule (corollary 1), determine the

distribution of returns at each age, say F(r; c, w); where w' =

[w',

distribution of returns), C is a vector consisting of the renewal fee schedules

From corollary 1 the proportion of patents who pay

the renewal at age a is the proportion with current returns above r or

simply the difference between the proportions not paying the renewal fee at age

a, and those not paying the renewal fee at age a—i or

Note that a; c, w) is calculated as the difference of

quantiles on two different distribution functions. This is a result of a second
difference between the myopic and stochastic models; in the stochastic model the
distribution of r changes in a non—trivial manner over age as agents uncover
more profitable ways of using their patented ideas.

Equation (4) provides the theoretical probabilities required to calculate

the likelihood function implied by the model. In order to formulate this
likelihood function explicitly, we require a brief description of the data (section

4 provides more detail on the data set), The data contain information on
different cohorts of patents, where a cohort is defined by the year the patent was

applied for. For some of these cohorts we do not observe the patents dropping
out at later ages, and for some we do not observe those dropping out at earlier
ages (there is censoring from both the left and the right). Let the index j
distinguish between alternative cohorts, f. and 1. be the first and last ages at
which we observe the number of patents paying the renewal for cohort j, and A. =

{f.,f.+1,...,l.,l.+1},

for j1,...,J. Then, for each j, the data contain: :1)

the sequence {n(a,j)}CA where ; n(f.,j) denotes the number of patents who did
J

not pay the renewal at f., n(a,j) for f. < a

1. denotes the number of patents

who stopped paying the renewal at each subsequent age until (and including) 1.,
and n(l.+1 ,j) denotes the number of patents which were still in force after

1.; and, (ii) the vector of the renewal fee schedules faced by the cohort, or

c.

—13—

Now consider a patent drawn randomly from a given cohort. It will either drop
Out by age f., drop Out at a subsequent age before 1.-f-i, or still be in force

after l.• Equation (4) implies that for each j the probabilities of these
mutually exclusive and exhaustive alternatives are given by:

Two points should be noted here. First the dimension in which the

properties of w approach those provided in proposition 2 is N, the sum of the
number of patents in the J cohorts, and as section 4 shows, N is unusually

large in our samples. Second, the limiting distribution of w follows from a
proposition due to Rao (1973, section 5.e.2), and the fact that the functions
n(a; c., u) [acA., j

J]

admit first order partials which are

continuous at O [since the benefit function in equation (2) is not differentiable
everywhere, this statement is not immediately obvious]. This same property
together with the consistency of the maximum likelihood estimator insure that

To complete the specification of the model we require a detailed description

the distribution of initial returns. This is provided in the next section.

estimates and the information matrix.

One advantage of the process specified in (6) is that is permits an explicit

solution for the sequence {r}L1 as a function of the parameter of the
model (see the next section). This process also has the following economic
interpretation. At each age agents perform experiments designed to enable them
to increase the profits from their patented ideas. These experiments can have
one of three types of outcomes. First, they may reveal that the patented ideas

can never be profitably exploited. This event occurs with probability
exp(—Or), that is it occurs with smaller probability the larger are the current
returns from holding the patent; and if such an outcome does materialize the
agent does not pay a renewal fee in the following year (the zero state is an

absorbing state in the stochastic process generating current returns. which

implies that if it is drawn the agent will let the patent lapse). The second
possible outcome is that the absorbing state does not occur, but the experiments
do not result in a use for the patented ideas which is more profitable than the
current one. In this case current returns decay at the rate

< 1 ,

as steps

—16--

forward by other agents in the economy gradually obsolete the returns from the
agent's own

patent,

and the agent must decide whether current returns and/or

the possibility of discovering a use which may

increase

those returns in the

future, make it worthwhile to pay the next renewal fee. Finally, the experiments
may actually uncover a use for the patented ideas which improves upon the
returns which could have been generated with the inforniation of the previous

year (the absorbing state does not occur and z > 6ra). The extent of the
iinprovment depends on the precise realization of z. This random variable has a

two parameter exponential distribution, that is; z has probability exp(—y/o)
of being greater than zero (experiments do not necessarily lead to outcomes

which yield positive returns), and has a density which declines at the constant

a1

rate 0a thereafter. Note that 0a =

a. With

< 1 this allows for the

possibility that the probability of uncovering a use which leads to returns

greater than a given number declines over age; or for the possibility that agents
perform their best experiments first.

< 1 is also a sufficient condition for

proposition 1 of the last section.

We have now defined the stochastic process generating the distribution of
(r2',r3,...,rL) from the distribution of r1. Note that this process is a member
of a five parameter family, that is w'

To complete the specifi-

cation of the model we require also a distribution of initial returns over

different patents, that is we require F1(r;w1). It is assumed that initial
returns distribute lognormally, or

Given

w, these cutoffs determine the drop out probabilities, or the sequence,

as defined in equation (4), which in turn determine the likelihood

of u (see equation 5). The second problem, then, is to provide a method which
calculates the drop Out probabilities correponding to particular values of w and

Finally, a maximization algorithm which finds that value of w that

r(a;w,c)}L1,

This sytem is obtained by solving for the

benefit function in an interval containing 1a at each age.' The cutoffs
corresponding to particular values of A and c were obtained by simply substi-

tuting these values into the system defined in this appendix.
1

Briefly, this problem is first reduced to a more manageable one by
expressing B(a,r), for each age, as the sum of L—a component functions. The
component functions for age a are definite integrals of the component functions
at age a+1 where the limits of integration are determined by the value of r and
by the subsequent cutoffs (by a+T, for t=1,...,L—a). This fact leads to a
functional recursion which can be solved using Macsyma (1983; Macsyma is a
computer programme designed for symbolic mathematical manipulations) to produce
the recursive system of analytic equations for {a}. The continuity of the
benefit function together with the features of Macsyma enable a check of the
Macsyma results for possible programming errors. Finally, the solution can be
simplified further by noting that the values of the component functions,
evaluated at a' must lie between two simple functions of the parameters of
the model. These boundary functions become progressively closer together for
the later functions at each age and can, therefore, be used to form an approximation whose error must lie in an easily calculable range, The Macsyma results
for this problem were obtained by Andrew Myers and myself.

One cannot, to the best of my knowledge, obtain the drop out probabilities

as analytic functions of w and a=1 As a result the simulated frequency
approach, suggested by Lerman and Manski (1981), was used to obtain estimates of
these probabilities. The simulation estimator of {TT(a; ,)}L1

,

say {(a; .)}L

is found by taking pseudo random draws from the distribution of initial returns
defined by equation (7) and w1, passing each through the stochastic process
defined by equation (6) and g' and calculating the proportion with r1 >

ral but 1a < ra, for a=1,...L [see the definition of rr(a;.) in equation
Let NSIM be the number of pseudo random draws used to evaluate the

4]

simulated frequencies. It is well known that 1(a;.) converges almost surely, in
NSIM, to ii(a;.) and has variance equal to !T(a;.)[1—ir(a;.)}/NsIM, (a=1 ,...

,L).

Define the pseudo likelihood of w, say £(w), to equal that value of the likelihood
function otained from substituting the simulated for the actual frequencies

in

*

equation (5). w was obtained by maximizing £(u) with respect to w.

The information matrix was obtained by perturbing each parameter by one percent
*
from w , calculating the implied derivatives of the simulated frequencies, and
substituting these derivatives into the formula for the information matrix pro—

vided in proposition 2. The NSIM used in the final round of the maximization
subroutine was twenty thousand (see the next paragraph and section 5); and the
change from an NSIM of ten thousand, to an NSIM of twenty thousand, did not have
a perceptible effect on the estimates.

Evaluating the simulated frequencies at a given value of w is a computer
time intensive task; the CPU time for a given evaluation being approximately

linear in NSIM. A maximization subroutine for a problem involving simulated
frequencies should, therefore, conserve on the number of times it evaluates the

likelihood function at large NSIM. The subroutine used here varied NSIM within

The computer programme to perform the simulation was designed by
Bronwyn Flail and myself, and her assistance was, as always, gratefully appreciated.

It was developed by modifying a programme entitled ON1DIF (a quasi

Newton method for obtaining the maximum of a function of k variables available
from the National Physics Laboratory, 1983; see also Gill, Murray, and

Wright, 1981). The jth round of the subroutine was defined by an NSIM, say
NSIM(j), and a perturbation vector, say

=

[lw,

...,

tw3}.

The modifications

made to QNMDIF directed it to find, with a relatively small number of function

evaluations, an w, say w, such that £.(w3) >

wi+l,k),

as a starting value, an increased NSIM

[NSIM(j+1) > NSIM(j)J, and a perturbation vector with smaller components

(w1 < &; i=1,... ,k). The final two rounds used an NSIM of ten and twenty
thousand, respectively, and a perturbation vector equal to one percent of the
starting value of

That completes the description of both the model and the estimation

technique. The next section describes the data set, while section 5 presents
and interprets the parameter estimates.

This maximization subroutine was developed by Dvora Ross and myself.
Two of the modifications we made to QNMDIF turned Out to be particularly
important. First to find the gradient vector for each iteration we used the
2k function evaluations obtained from changing each component of the parameter
vector by positive and negative values of that component of the perturbation
vector. If both perturbations with respect to a parameter resulted in function
values less than the starting value for the iteration, the derivative with
respect to that parameter was set equal to zero. If not, the derivative was
set equal to that implied by the function evaluations. Second the stepsize
search was modified so that function values corresponding to small differences
in stepsize were not calculated. I am grateful to the staff of the Hebrew
University computing center for their help in allocating computer time to us.

Section 4. The Data

The data used in this study were obtained directly from the patent offices
of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom (the U.K.) by Mark Schankerman and
myself.4

Table 1 summarizes some of the characteristics of this data.

Row 1 of the table provides the first age at which a renewal fee is due, or

f. There is no information on renewals for ages less than f and the renewals at
age f reflect events that have occurred over the first f ages. In the U.K. then,
the first age at which we have information on the drop Outs resulting from
events

that have occurred over the previous year is a=6. Rows 2.3, and 4

provide, respectively; the last age at which a patent can be kept in force by
payment of a mandatory renewal fee (L), the dates of application for the
cohorts studied, and the years in which renewals are observed.5

In all

countries, then, we have at least partial information on the renewal

behaviour of cohorts applied for in most of the 1950's, throughout the 1960's,
and in the early 1970's. The required renewal fee schedules (see assumption 2,
or A2, in section 1) were obtained in nominal domestic currency, converted to
real domestic currency using the country's own implicit G.N.P. deflator, and

then transferred into 1980 U.S. dollars using the official exchange rate in

1980. All monetary values are, therefore, in 1980 U.S. dollars.
Rows 5 and 6 illustrate an important intercountry difference in the characteristics of the data.

In France and the U.K. the data include all the patents

This data set will be described in more detail in a paper we are
currently writing. We are indebted to the respective patent offices for
providing us with the data and graciously answering our subsequent queries.
Post world war Germany allowed reapplication of patents previously applied
for. By 1952 these were less than 1% of German applications, and this explains
the choice of 1952 for the starting cohort for Germany. The French patent
office only provided information on renewals between 1970 and 1981 . Given the
values of f and L in France, this implies that the data contain partial information on the renewal behavior of cohorts applied for between 1951 and 1979 in
that country. In light of these facts, I decided to use only post 1950 cohorts
for the analysis of the U.K. L was changed to 20 in 1976 in Germany, and in
1980 in the U.K., and this explains the final renewal years for these countries.

applied for in the cohorts specified in row 3, but in Germany the data contain

only those patents granted. Patents granted by date of application were not
available for France and the U.K. , though a rough estimate of the ratio of

grants to applications in these two countries can be obtained by comparing
the number of patents applied for to those granted over time (see the notes to

Table 1). This ratio was quite large in France (.93), a bit smaller in the U.K.
(.83), but only .35 in Germany (row 6). As a result of the facts that the data
contain grants in Germany (in contrast to applications in France and the U.K.),
and that the German granting criteria select Out only a relatively small portion
of the patents applied for, the average number of patents per cohort is smaller

in Germany (about 21,000) than in France or in the UK. (about 37,000; see row 7).
Note that rows 3 and 7 imply that the data contain information on about one
million patents in each of France and the U.K.

,

and on about half of a million

patents in Germany.

Figures 2 and 3 provide the proportion renewed, and the proportion dropping
out, by age, averaged over the cohorts for which these statistics were observed;
while figure 4 provides the mean of the renewal fee schedules used in the analysis.
Figure 1 makes it clear that there is a distinct difference between the age—path

of the proportion renewed in Germany, and those in the other two countries. This
difference is magnified in figure 2. In Germany the proportion dropping Out is
much lower in the early ages, subsequently overtakes and then stays larger than

the proportion dropping out in the other two countries. The lower drop out
probabilities in the early ages in Germany could reflect the success of the
German patent office in weeding out the patents which have high probabilities of
not being profitably developed; especially since the renewal fees in the early
ages in Germany are relatively small and comparable to those in the other countries

(see figure 4). After age five, however, these fees are increasing at a much
faster pace in Germany, and this should, all else equal, generate larger drop
out probabilities in the later ages in Germany.

Figure 2 also illustrates that there are, in fact, substantial differences
in the proportion dropping Out both between different ages for a given

country,

and between countries for a given age (the drop out proportion for age five in
the U.K. is not illustrated but equals .305). This understates the total
variance in the drop out proportions since there is variance between cohorts

at a given age in each country. Most of this latter variance is concentrated

in the early ages. Finally, note that in all countries (though to a varying
extent) the drop out probabiliites do not decline at as fast a pace in the last

few ages as in the ages immediately preceeding them. This is what we would
expect from a stochastic model of renewal behaviour, since as the age of the
patent approaches L, the option value of holding the patent goes to zero.
Turning to figure 3 note that the average cost of renewal schedules are

nondecreasing in age. This is also true for the renewal fee schedules of each
year and underlies the form of the solution to the agents decision problem

provided in Corollary 1. The renewal fees are quite small in all countries in
the early years, and increase significantly faster in Germany thereafter.

—27—

Section 5. The Empirical Results

Table 2 provides the parameter estimates, different dimensions of the data,

and some summary statistics, for each country. It was decided at the outset to

set the discount factor () equal to .9 in all runs; and the results presented
in the table are conditional on

•96

The parameter estimates in Germany and France are all positive and highly

significant. Recall that the dimension in which parameter estimates converge to
their true values is the total number of patents or NPAT. The extremely large
values of NPAT (row B.2) explain the relatively low estimated standard errors in

France and Germany. On the other hand the estimated information matrix for the
U.K. was singular (see footnote b to the table). As will become clear presently,
this occurs because the estimates imply that in order to distinguish between
different possible values of the parameter vector we require independent

information on events which occur during the early ages; and in the U.K. we do
not have such information until age 6.
To get an indication of the fit of the model the difference between the
estimated and acutual it's was squared and averaged over the NCI-IRTAGE (row B.4)

distinct cohort—age cells for which these proportions are observed. The
resulting numbers appear as MSE{ir] in row C.1 of the table. Comparing them to
the variance in the actual ii's (i.e., to V[x;data} in row C.3), it is clear that

in France and Germany only a small fraction of the variance in the acutal x's is
not

accounted for by the model (1.4% in France, and .6% in

the

U.K. this fraction is somewhat larger (6.4 %). To see whether there was any

Germany), while in

indication of cohort specific differences in the fit of the model, the differences
between the estimated and actual x's were also used to calculate a pseudo

6

This decision, and the decision to make only one run for each country,
were taken, in part, to minimize on computer time. The CPU time for each run
increases more than proportionately to the number of parameters estimated.

provided in row C.2 of the table, and seem to distribute about two.

I return to

further comments on the fit of the model after a brief description of some of

the implications of the parameter estimates; particularly those relating to the

characteristics of the learning process. Since it is these characteristics that
the data in the U.K. are not rich enough to determine, I shall concentrate on
the estimates for France and Germany.

The parameters whose estimates exhibit substantial intercountry differences
are u,

°R'

and a. The estimates of ji and °R imply that a substantial fraction

of the patents in the French data started out with low, almost negligible, initial
returns; while the higher mean and the lower coefficient of variation in Germany
imply that this phenomena was not nearly as pronounced among German patents (the
mode of the estimated distribution of initial returns is under ten dollars in
France but is over two hundred dollars in Germany; and the parameter estimates
indicated that about thirty percent of the French patents had initial returns

under fifty dollars, while under one percent of the German patents do). The
larger a in Germany implies that, on average, the holders of the patents
included in the German data had a higher probability of discovering uses which

increased the returns to their patented ideas. Recall that the German data
includes only patents granted while the French data includes all patents applied
for; and that the granting criteria seem to be particularly stringent in Germany

(Table 1). It seems, then, that the German patent office was, on the whole,
successful in weeding Out patents with low initial returns and a smaller
probability of increasing those returns over time.

The estimates of 0, 6, , and y do not vary much between the two countries.
The low estimates of 4>

(about .5) implies that the learning process is

concentrated in the early ages. Table 3 illustrates this point. The descriptive

statistics provided in this and in subsequent tables were obtained from a
simulation run of 20,000 draws based on the mean of the renewal fee schedules

and the parameter estimates of Table 2. Consider first the column of figures for
France. The mean of the initial distribution of returns was 380 dollars.
During the initial year just under twenty percent of the French patent holders
discovered a use which enabled them to increase subsequent returns, while

over six percent discovered that their patented ideas could never be profitably

exploited. These six percent were the only patents whose renewal fees were not
paid in the second year. The holders of the remaining patents paid the renewal
fee and maintained the option of patent protection on the results of the second

year's experiments. The substantial learning that occurred over the first year
caused a sharp increase in the average returns of the patents still in force in

the second year. During the second year nuch less learning occured than occurred
during the first year. An additional nine percent of the patent holders stopped

paying the renewal fee at the third age. Of these, about five percent were owned
by agents who, after doing experiments for two years, had decided that it was
not worthwhile to pay the renewal fee in order to have the option of patent

protection on the results of subsequent experiments. Average learning probabilities
decreased further over the next two ages. They were just about sufficient to
keep the mean of the current returns earned on the patents still in force

constant. There was essentially no learning after the fifth age, and the effect
of the obsolescence process clearly dominates the learning processes when
comparing the means of the patents still in force in the fifth, to those still in

force in the fourth, ages. The major qualitative difference between the German
and the French columns in this table arises from the fact, noted earlier, that
the German parameter estimates imply that a much smaller proportion of the

patents in the German data started out with negligible returns. As a result
most of the patents included in the German data were known to be worth something

—34--

at the outset, and more of the German patent holders who did not discover a more
profitable use over time had current returns which induced them to pay the
renewal fee until the ages in which those fees started rising sharply (which was

after age five, see figire 4)!

I now return briefly to the issue of the fit of the model. Figure 5 provides
the proportion renewed, by age, averaged over the cohorts for which this

proportion was observed. The thick lines provide the proportions in the data,
the thin lines those estimated by our model, and, for comparison, we also provide
the proportions estimated from a model which does not allow for learning,
(the broken lines). The no learning model is a model in which patents are
endowed with an initial distribution of returns which decay determiriistically

thereafter. It is obtained by changing the probability statement in equation

(6) to read; r+l

with probability one.8 In this figure it is hard to

distinguish the curve estimated by the model with learning, from the data. On
the other hand the model without learning predicts too few renewals in the early
ages (i.e., too many drop Outs), too many renewals in the middle ages, and too

few again in the later ages. Recall that the renewal fees are close to constant
over the initial ages. As a result, the model without learning cannot accommodate
both the small number of drop Outs fl

the initial age, and the sharp increase

in the number of drop Outs over the next few ages. This point is magnified

The parameter estimates for the U.K. presented in Table 2 imply a learning
process which is similar to those described for France and Germany. The problem
with the U.K. estimates was that without independent information on the drop
Outs over the first few ages, the likelihood function could not distinguish
between different values for the learning parameters, particularly S and 4. As a
result of this fact the maximization algorithm also had much more difficulty in
finding the estimates for the U.K.
8

As one would expect from the large size of our samples (NPAT) the likelihood ratio test statistic for the null hypothesis that there was no learning was
inordinately large; over 20,000 for Germany and over 60,000 for France.

in figure 6 which provides the proportion dropping Out, by age, averaged over

the cohorts for which this proportion is observed. The model with learning
accounts for the combination of the low initial drop outs and the increase
in the number of drop Outs over the next few ages by estimates which imply
that the option value of patents which start out with low returns is initially
Iigh,

but

then declines rather rapidly. As will be shown presently, this model

accounts for the spread of those who do drop Out over the later ages by a
somewhat skewed distribution of initial returns, and, more importantly, by a
learning process which increases the skew in the distribution of returns
substantially over the next few ages.

In figure 6 we can actually see the differences between the estimates from

the model with learning, and the data. These differences are concentrated in
the middle ages. The age—specific average drop out probabilities in the French
data have two local maxima (at ages three and seven). The estimates from the
model for France also have two local maxima (and at the same ages), but the
model's estimates of these maxima are somewhat too high, and its estimate of the

trough between them is too low. In Germany the data provide a rather flat age
distribution of average drop out probabilities between ages eight and eleven.
The model's estimates replace this with two local maxima and a minimum; though
neither the maxima nor the minimum are nearly as pronounced as those estimated

for the earlier ages in France. In addition, the model's estimate of the
average drop out probabilities in the later ages are a bit too high in France,
and a bit too low in Germany.

The proportions which actually enter the likelihood function (the n's) are
a combination of the renewal proportions (for the last age for each cohort, and
the first where there was left censoring) and the drop out proportions (for all

other cohort—age combinations). These are also the proportions which underly

Though figures 5

and 6 indicate why the nan square error measures are low relative to the
variance of u in the data; they also point Out that there are still some aspects
of the data that the model does not account for, and this should be kept in

mind when considering the implications of the parameter estimates.9
Figures 7 and 8 provide the distribution of current returns

at age one,

age three, and age five, in France, and in Germany, respectively. Part A of
these figures contain the first 99.5 percentiles of these distributions, while

part B narrows in on the lowest 75 percentiles. Two

from the figures. First the distributions, particularly those for the later
ages, are extremely skewed. As a result it is hard to

Second, there is a distinct pattern to the evolution of these distri-

bution functions over age. Between the first and the third ages there is a
substantial increase in the dispersion of the distribution functions. This is

easiest to see in part B of the figures. It occurs because of two implications
of the parameter estimates. First between these ages the experiments of a
It is worth noting that the intercohort differences in the drop out proportions for a given age and country were fit quite well by the data. As noted
in section 4 most of this variance was concentrated in the early ages. This
was also what the model predicted since the last age at which the option value
of patents with low returns induced payment of renewal fees depended on the
precise age at which the renewal fees began to rise. Even given this point,
however, it is still undoubtedly the case that the extremely large values of
NPAT and NSIM in table 2 imply that the
MSE(n) statistics provided in that table
are too large to be rationalized in terms of binomial sampling error in the
empirical and estimated frequencies. Though this problem (which is called the
problem of extra binomial sampling variance
by Williams, 1982; see also the
review by Haseman and Kupper, 1979)
occurs frequently when analyzing the
determinants of proportions, I do not know of any logically consistent way of
accounting for it when the model has a sequential dimension. It is also worth
restating here the related problem noted in the introduction; that is, the
complexity of the estimation procedure in discrete choice optimal stochastic
control problems such as ours makes it difficult to determine the robustness of
the conclusions to the particular distributional
assumptions made (for a
discussion of related issues, see Beckman and Singer, forthcoming). This is one
reason for examining (in some detail) the consistency of our empirical results
with known intercountry differences in patenting procedures.

large portion of the patent holders had enabled them to increase their returns,

and the effect of this was to thicken the tall of the distribution function and

push it to the right. On the other hand, many of the holders of patents which
had negligible initial returns, and recall that such patents were a much larger
fraction of the French data, had discovered by age three that their patented
ideas were not likely to enable them to increase their returns in the future,

and have consequently dropped out. By age three, then, the distribution developed
a mass at zero. A comparison of the percentiles for age five to those of age
three reveals the onset of the obsolescence process; that is the percentiles
from the age five distribution are below (strictly speaking, never above) the
same percentiles from the distribution at age three.

The skew in the distribution of initial returns combined with the substantial
increase in this skew over the early ages, lead to a highly skewed distribution

of realized patent values. Table 4 provides percentiles and lorenz curve
coefficients from the distribution of realized patent values; where the realized
value of a patent is defined as the discounted sum of net returns (current
returns minus renewal fees) from age one to the last age the given patent is

kept in force. Again I begin by considering the column of figures for France.
Twenty—five percent of the patents in the French data had realized values of
seventy—five dollars or less.'°

These patents contributed about a half of one

percent to the total value of the patents in a cohort, while the patents in the
lower half of the distribution contributed less than two percent of the total

value of a cohort. The median of the distribution of realized values ($534) was

10

Of course some of these patents had negative (though small in absolute
value) realized values, as they were patents who paid early renewals for options
which did not materialize. If, for example, we had defined the realized values
as the discounted sum of net returns from age two, rather than from age one (as
in the table), the lorenz curve coefficient corresponding to p = .25 would have
been negative, though close to zero.

less than one tenth its mean ($5,631); and the five percent of the distribution
with the highest realized values contribute about half of the total value of a

cohort. The German distribution of realized values was somewhat less skewed
than the distribution in France; though even the German distribution was

extremely skewed. The difference between the two distributions was7 as might
have been expected from the fact that in Germany the data refers to grants
rather than applications, most pronounced at the lowest percentiles. In Germany
these percentiles were non—negligible, albeit, quite small. Still only about
7

percent

of the patents in Germany had realized values in

excess of $5OOOO; in

France only two and a half percent had values this large. Given the size of the
cohorts this implies that, on average, about a thousand patents which had
realized values in excess of $50,000 were applied for annually in France, and
about fifteen hundred such patents were granted annually in Germany.

One other point is worthy of note here. The estimate of the ratio of the
average realized value in a cohort of patents applied for in France, to that
value in a cohort of patents granted in Germany, is .35, which is just equal to
the average of the ratios of grants to applications in the German cohorts (see

table 1). The estimates seem to imply, then, that the mean of the realized
values of the patents applied for in the two countries was similar. On the other

hand, there were a significantly larger number of patents applied for per year
in Germany than in France [about 60,780 in Germany, versus 36,865 in France); so
that, on average, the total value of a cohort of patents in Germany was larger
than the value of a French cohort.

The patent stock held in a country at a given point in time consists of the
patents from the cohorts applied for over the previous L years which are

still in force at that time. Table 6 provides the annual net returns earned by
the patents of each age contained in a stock which is

constructed by assuming

—44—

that each of the previous L cohorts began with the average number of patents per

cohorts and faced the mean of the renewal fee schedules. The entries in this
table are in thousands of 1980 U.S. dollars. The net annual returns earned from
holding the patent stocks in these countries is estimated at; .315 billion
dollars in France, .386 billion dollars in the U.K., and .512 billion dollars in

Germany. The next section considers likely implications of this, and the other
results provided in this section.

Section

6. More General Aspects of the Empirical Results

Many of the detailed implications of the parameter estimates were presented

in the last section. This final section provides a brief discussion of their
relationship to a few7 more general, issues in the economics of technological

change. I focus primarily on; the estimated characteristics of the learning
process (Table 3 and Figures 5 and 6), the estimated skew in the distribution of
the value of holding patents (Table 4)

,

and on the estimates of the annual

returns earned from holding the patent stocks of the alternative countries (the
last row of Table 5).

To get an indication of the importance of the incentives created by the
patent laws we would like to compare the estimates provided in Table 5 to
either, the total returns that accrued to the patented ideas, or to the

expenditures that went into developing them. Neither of these two figures are
available, but the OECD (1975; Tables III and IV)

does

provide estimates of the

R & D expenditures funded by the business enterprises in these countries in 1963
(which is the inidcohort in our data). The estimates of the annual returns from
holding the patent stocks were respectively, 15.56%, 11.03%, and 13.83% of the R
& D expenditures of the business enterprises in France, the U.K. and Germany;

and the sum of these returns across countries was 13.14% of the sum of their

R & D expenditures. Since there may be returns earned as a result of patenting
per se, regardless of whether the patents were ever renewed, and since our
estimates only pertain to the returns earned by renewing (or holding) patents
already in force, the numerator of this ratio may slightly understate the annual

monetary value of the incentives created by the patent system. Moreover, the
ratio suffers from the fact that we have not netted out various balance of trade
effects (business enterprises in these countries also own patents in force
elsewhere, and foreign business enterprises own patents in force in these
countries; while not all the business sector's R & D expenditures are directed

—47—

towards patentable innovations, and not all patentees are business enterprises).

The ratio does, however, suggest that the proprietary rights resulting from the
patent laws create annual returns which are non—negligible in comparison to
privately funded R & D activity.

The returns earned from holding patents may, of course, be only a small

fraction of the returns that accrue to patented ideas. Nevertheless the general
similarity between the shape of the estimated distributions of the value of
holding patents on the one hand (see Table 4) , and currently available evidence

on the distribution of the values of patented ideas on the other, is quite

striking. In particular the evidence available from disaggregated case studies
indicates an extremely skewed distribution of the values of patented ideas (see
Sanders, Rossnian, and Harris, 1958; and Gabrowski and Vernon, 1983). Scherer
(1965, plo98),

for

example, notes that the data provided in Sanders, Rossman,

and Harris (1958) suggests a Paraeto—Levy distribution with an infinite mean for
the distribution of profits from patented ideas; while Garbrowski and Vernon
(1983) summarize their studies on the profitability of new pharmaceutical entities
with the statement,
"In effect, these results indicate that pharmaceutical firms are heavily

dependent on obtaining an occasional 'big winner' to cover their R & D costs

and generate profits [Gabrowski and Vernon, 1983, p.11]

Larger sample econometric studies have focused on the relationship between the
number of patents applied for and alternative measures of the outputs and the
inputs into inventive activity [see the articles in Griliches (ed.), forthcoming].
Fakes, (1981) provides a detailed time—series cross—section analysis of the
reduced form relationship between patent applications, R & D expenditures,
and changes in the stock market value of firms, that allows for dynamic error

components to intercede between these variables. That article concludes

—48-

that changes in the number of patents applied for by firms

are

a very noisy

measure of the changes in stock market value of their R & D related output, but
that, on average, increases in patent applications are associated with large
increases in the firm's value; just what we would expect from a highly skewed

distribution of the value of patented ideas. In addition, a strong simultaneous
relationship between the factors driving R & D expenditures and those driving
patents was found; suggesting that a significant search for uses and improvements
to the patented ideas continues at least during the early years of a patent's
life.

There is an explanation of the patenting process which is at least
consistent with both the empirical results found in this paper, and with those

cited above. Patents are applied for at an early stage in the inventive process,
a stage in which there is still substantial uncertainty concerning both
the returns that will be earned from holding the patents, and the returns that

will accrue to the patented ideas. Gradually the patentors uncover the true
value of their patents. Most turn out to be of little value, but the rare
"winner" justifies the investments that were made in developing them, If this
explanation captures the nature of the patenting process we would not expect to
find a very stable relationship between profits and current and past patents, or
between profits and the current and past R & D expenditures which lead to their;

except possibly for very large aggregates. For individual economic units we
would expect most increases in patents not to lead to any increase in profits,
and for there to be an occasional jump in profits which is not necessarily

preceeded by any increase in patenting. Similar statements can be made
concerning the relationship between profits and the R & D expenditures that

lead to the development of the patented ideas. Growth through discovery will
occur in spurts, and these spurts will be probabilistically related to the

Investments which preceeded them. Traditional production function approaches to

—49—

obtaining estimates of either the rate of return to the investments which
produced the patents, or the determinants of the quantity of resources invested

in their development, are not likely to be very precise. Nor will they provide
much evidence on the characteristics of the distribution of possible outcomes;
features of the problem that are likely to be particularly important in
analyzing the rich set of issues determining the evolution of firm and industry

structure. An alternative, pointed Out by Nelson and Winter (1982), and Telser
(1982), is to be more careful in the econometric modelling of the inventive
process itself; employing, perhaps, controlled search processes in which investment
expenditures affect the distribution of possible outcomes.''
Disaggregated patent renewal data from over fifty national and regional
patent

offices

with coverage,

containing both the technical field of the patent, and the patentor,

in

most cases, dating back at least to 1973, is currently

available from Il\TADOC (see references). A more disaggregate patent renewal

study which estimates the return to patent protection by technical field, and by
nationality and type of patentor (e.g., individuals, small business enterprises,

large corporate entities) is likely to prove extremely valuable. Issues related
to which sectors in a particular country, and which countries, derive disproportionate

returns from the patent laws lie at the heart of much of the discussion

of the social costs and benefits of alternative patent systems

(see Scherer 1979

chapter 16, and the literature cited there). Moreover, a more disagrregated
study would provide information on both, differences in the characteristics of
the learning process and in the distribution of possible outcomes, and differences
in the relationship between patent statistics and alternative measures of

inventive inputs and outputs, between different industries. Policy, as well as
empirical and theoretical ana'ysis would benefit considerably from such
information.

A step in this direction has been made by Ericson and Fakes, 1983.

Though not differentiable in r everywhere, B(a,r) is differentiable in r in an

I now derive the boundary functions, and consider

their limiting rates of convergence. The researcher can use the exact approximations to calculate where the approximation error is within tolerable limits
for the problem at hand.

Note first that (A3.1O) and the fact that h'+÷j(Z) is nonnegative and

nondecreasing in z for zc[ r

,

and nondecreasing in z for zE[ Vr

°),

implies that h+R+1(1Sz) is nonnegative

, °). This fact allows us to show that

8H+i() is bounded by two simple functionals ha+v() The upper bound is found
by

noting that (A3.lOc) implies that

h"1(z) < 8h"

To obtain the lower bound note that the monotonicity of hv(.) and the
definition of H+2(.) imply that

H1(6z) < e[l-exp(-6Oz)]h(6z){Q2(6z) Qa+2vra+l+v)}

Clearly the resulting approximation errors will be less than the values of the

sequences themselves and these can be obtained directly from (A3.14). To
consider their limiting properties as

(which implies L-*cc) recall that

and assume that the nondecreasirig sequence {c}1 has limit equal
to

[this implies that lim(a+) r

for each age, both sequences {Av+l}

limiting rate

C]. Then A3.14 implies that,

and {Uv÷i}o converge to zero at the

exp(—5 c/Y+i)• Since the lower bounds,

and

decline faster then the upper bounds, so does the approximation error.
The following procedure was used to obtain the results reported in this

paper. For each (relevant) age an exact calculation of the first four elements
for both sequences

v iL—a—i

r V iL—a—2
and lTJa+iIv..0

was made using (A3.lO). After

checking that using the approximation for the fourth element instead of its
exact value did not have a perceptible effect on the cutoffs, that and

subsequent elements were replaced by the approximations for them.
