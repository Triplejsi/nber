ABSTRACT
In this paper we use a very large matched database on firms and employees to analyze the use of temporary
agencies by low earners, and to estimate the impact of temp employment on subsequent employment
outcomes for these workers. Our results show that, while temp workers have lower earnings than
others while working at these agencies, their subsequent earnings are often higher - but only if they
manage to gain stable work with other employers. Furthermore, the positive effects seem mostly to
occur because those working for temp agencies subsequently gain access to higher-wage firms than
do comparable low earners who do not work for temps. The positive effects we find seem to persist
for up to six years beyond the period during which the temp employment occurred.

I. Introduction
Do labor market intermediaries in general, and “temp” agencies in particular, help
unskilled workers with limited work experience transition to more stable and higher wage
jobs? Earlier research on the impact of temporary help agencies for this population was
generally positive. However, recent research by Autor and Houseman (2005, 2007), using
data from a random assignment experiment, has raised questions about the robustness of
the early research, and especially on whether any positive effects of temp agency
employment persist over the longer run. Other researchers have continued to find positive
effects for low earners of temp employment, among other efforts by a range of labor
market “intermediaries” such as unions and various not-for-profit placement agencies.
In this paper we contribute to the ongoing discussion about temp agencies and
low-wage workers in a number of ways. We do this by using a very large scale matched
database on firms and employees that enables us to establish a broad set of facts about the
workers who use temp agencies, and the firms to which they transition. The dataset has
several key features that we use throughout the study. The first of these is that it is
longitudinal in both firms and workers. A second key feature is that we estimated fixed
personal characteristics that are unobserved in many studies. We also directly estimate
the premium (or discount) that different firms pay observationally equivalent workers.
Our analysis begins by estimating the impact of temp employment for initially
low earners on their subsequent earnings. We then examine whether workers who work
for temp agencies eventually transition to firms that pay higher wage premia than do
workers who find firms on their own. This is followed by a consideration of the extent to
which these firm characteristics can account for any observed improvements in the

1

earnings of these workers. Finally, we examine the long-term stability of the employment
and earnings outcomes for low-wage workers engaged in temp work, relative to those
who are not.

II. Previous Literature
The fact that the temporary help industry generates substantial employment for
workers in the low-wage labor market has been well documented (Autor and Houseman
2002). But its impact on the employment outcomes of these workers, however, is not
clear a priori. On the one hand, temp agencies might provide a productive stepping stone
on the path to more stable employment, both by reducing search time and imparting
useful job skills. On the other hand, they might be seen as part of a “secondary” labor
market in which low-wage workers churn from bad job to bad job.
Why might temp agencies have positive effects? A body of earlier work strongly
suggests that the characteristics of firms and jobs, independently of worker skills, affect
the labor market outcomes of less-skilled workers (Abowd et al., 1999; Holzer et al.,
2004).1 And various groups of less-skilled workers, especially minorities, might have less
access on their own to stable employment and higher-wage jobs. For example, these
workers might lack the informal networks and contacts that are often necessary to gain
such employment (Holzer, 1987; Ioannides and Loury, 2004); or they might lack the
transportation and information needed to overcome “spatial mismatch” between their
residential locations (particularly in inner-city neighborhoods or rural areas) and the more
suburbanized locations of better jobs (Holzer, 1991; Kain, 1992; Ihlanfeldt and Sjoquist,
1

This notion, of course, has been heavily debated for decades in the labor economics literature – especially
in discussions over “dual labor markets” and “efficiency wages.” See Katz (1987) and Rebitzer (1993) for
thoughtful reviews on these issues. For an earlier treatment of this topic see Dunlop (1957).

2

1998). On the latter issue, Andersson et al. (2005) also show that employers paying
higher wage premia tend to locate further away from the residential areas inhabited for
low-wage workers than do other employers, further suggesting some geographic
mismatch between less-skilled workers and higher-wage job opportunities.
But do “temp” agencies” help less-skilled workers overcome these geographic
and informational gaps, thus improving their employment opportunities? Does the
general skills training that they often provide these workers (Autor, 2001) perhaps
contribute to their opportunities as well?
Initial empirical research based on both survey and administrative data provided
some evidence that temp agencies were providing pathways to more stable employment.
Lane et al. (2003) applied matched propensity score techniques to data from the Survey
of Income and Program Participation and concluded that spells in temp agency
employment improved labor market outcomes relative to spells of unemployment.
Heinrich, Mueser and Troske (2005) came to similar conclusions.
In a more broadranging study using the same dataset used in this paper,
Andersson, Holzer and Lane (2005) found that low earners employed by temporary help
services who subsequently changed firms were more likely to exit their low-earning
status than were low earners not working for temps; while those who stayed with the
temporary help firms had much lower chances of improving their earnings status. This
was true even after controlling for person fixed effects, and a variety of observable
worker characteristics. Furthermore, the research suggested that the positive impacts of
earlier temp employment were largely accounted for by the characteristics of the firms in
which they were subsequently employed This suggested that temp agencies seemed to

3

offer low earners better access to other higher-wage firms, rather than higher-wage
employment while at the agency.
More recent work continues to show positive effects. For instance, Benner et al.
(2007) examined survey data on employers and workers in Milwaukee and Silicon Valley
who used temp agencies, and a variety of not-for-profit intermediaries, to help fill job
vacancies. Like Andersson et al., they find that workers who used temp agencies to find
employment had higher earnings in subsequent jobs - though this seemed more due to
higher hours worked than higher wages. Some other types of intermediaries – including
community colleges, labor unions, and other not-for-profit agencies - seemed to generate
higher wages as well as hours worked in subsequent jobs. A large number of European
studies have similar positive findings (see Ichino et al., 2006, for a review).
However, all of these studies relied on econometric techniques to identify the
appropriate comparison groups, and concerns remain about selection on variables
(including time-varying characteristics in studies that control for person fixed effects)
that are unobservable to the econometrician. In the only study to date that has used
random assignment of TANF recipients to temporary help agencies, Autor and Houseman
(2005, 2007) found that temp agencies increased the short-term earnings for workers; but
their longer-term employment was characterized by lower earnings, less frequent
employment and higher welfare recidivism.
Autor and Houseman also found that other intermediaries, which generated
longer-term job placements for their clients, also generated some positive impacts over
time. But some questions remain about the external validity of their results – especially
since they are based only on TANF recipients, rather than a broader range of low-wage

4

workers; and they use data from the “Work First” agency in only one city (Detroit) to
generate their findings.2

III. Our Data
A) An Overview of the LEHD Data
The data used in this study are drawn from the Longitudinal Employer Household
Dynamics (LEHD) program at the U.S. Census Bureau. The core of the dataset is the
universe of state-level quarterly Unemployment Insurance (UI) earnings records from 44
states and the District of Columbia. The UI wage records cover data from the early
1990’s to the third quarter of 2006 and have been merged with a variety of other
household and employer survey data, including the 2000 Decennial Census of
Population, the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the American Community Survey
(ACS). This integration, which takes place under strict confidentiality protection
protocols, is represented in Figure 1.

Autor and Houseman note that their nonexperimental results are very similar to those of other researchers,
perhaps implying that their results are more generalizable than might be expected on the basis of the
particular sample on which they are based.

The LEHD data have elsewhere been described in great detail (Andersson et al.,
2005, Abowd et al 2004). Briefly, the UI wage records, which consist of quarterly reports
filed by employers every quarter for each individual in covered employment, permit the
construction of a database that provides longitudinal information on workers, firms, and
the match between the two. The coverage is roughly 96% of private non-farm wage and
salary employment; the coverage of agricultural and federal government employment is
less comprehensive. Self-employed individuals and independent contractors are also not
covered. Although the administrative records themselves are subject to some error, staff
at the LEHD program has invested substantial resources in cleaning the records and
making them internally consistent.3
The Census Bureau information used in this study consists primarily of basic
demographic information: date of birth, place of birth, sex and a crude measure of race
and ethnicity. These are available for almost all workers in the dataset -- the non-match
rate is about 4%. The UI wage records have also been matched with the Current
3

The approach is described in Abowd and Vilhuber (2003).

6

Population Survey, but since this is a cross-sectional match we simply use it as a
consistency check in the research.
There are clearly many advantages associated with this integrated data base -- its
enormous sample size, longitudinal structure, and information on employer-employee
matches. There are also some disadvantages. One is that hours or weeks worked are
typically not reported by employers. Another is that it is impossible to identify whether,
when multiple jobs are held within a quarter, they are held sequentially or at the same
time. We address both of these issues by creating, for each individual in the data, a
measure of that person's annualized earnings at the primary employer in each year that
they appear in the data. That is, for the entire year that an individual appears in a state, we
identify his/her primary employer as the one that pays them the highest earnings in that
year.
There are two additional conceptual issues to be addressed. Although we typically
refer to the employer as a ``firm,'' the actual reporting unit in the data is an
administrative, rather than an economic entity; in other words, the filing unit reflects an
``Employer Identification Number,'' rather than a specific firm. The distinction is
immaterial for about 70% of workers, who work for a single establishment employer -but for those who work for a multiple establishment employer, it is really not clear
whether they are working for the ``firm'' or an establishment. The other conceptual issue
involves the measurement of earnings. According to the BLS Handbook of Methods
(1997) UI wage records measure ``gross wages and salaries, bonuses, stock options, tips,
and other gratuities, and the value of meals and lodging, where supplied.'' They do not

7

include employer contributions to OASDI, health insurance, workers compensation,
unemployment insurance, and private pension and welfare funds.
Given the sensitive nature of the dataset, it is worth discussing the confidentiality
protection in some detail. All data that are brought in to the LEHD system have been
made anonymous, in the sense that standard identifiers and names are stripped off and
replaced by a unique ``Protected Identification Key'' or PIK. Only Census Bureau
employees or individuals who have Special Sworn Status are permitted to work with the
data, and they have not only been subject to an FBI check but also are subject to a
$250,000 fine and/or five years in jail if the identity of an individual or business is
disclosed. All projects have to be reviewed by the Census Bureau and other data
custodians, and any tables or regression results that are released are subject to full
disclosure review.
Standard measures of human capital include such variables as education and
experience. Other measures, such as ability or family background, have rarely been able
to be captured. Yet work by Juhn, Murphy and Pierce (1993), for example, demonstrates
that a major contribution to increased earnings inequality in the 1980’s was an increase in
return to “unmeasured” characteristics—for example, interpersonal skills. Work by
Holzer (1996), as well as the sociology literature, also finds that businesses increasingly
value characteristics of the employee that have not traditionally been observable—again,
interpersonal skills are frequently mentioned.

8

The newly developed longitudinal dataset permits the quantification of the value of
these measures, although not permitting a decomposition of the source.4 This is achieved
by capturing the portable component of individual earnings—that component that
belongs to an individual as she or he moves from job to job in the labor market (and that
is separate from the type of firm for which she or he works). In order to estimate this
effect, the LEHD staff decomposed of the log real annualized full-time, full-year wage
rate (ln w) into person and firm effects.5

ln wit = θ i + xit β +ψ J( i ,t ) + ε it

1) hˆijt = θˆi + xitexp βˆ exp
zˆ j = ψˆ j

The definition of human capital we use here, h, is the part associated with the person
fixed effect—the unobservable individual heterogeneity—and the measurable personal
characteristics (labor force experience, education). We are also interested in capturing
and analyzing the role of the firm effect ψ. The firm effect literally captures the extent to
which the firm the worker is attached to pays above or below average wages (after
controlling for person effects).6

4

We interpret this person fixed effect as a broad measure of human capital, though the source of the human
capital – whether inter-personal skills, cognitive ability, family background or some combination of these
and other factors – cannot be determined.
5
This methodology is drawn from Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis (1999) and further developed by Abowd
et al. (2003). A key assumption underlying this methodology is that worker mobility is (largely)
exogenous. See Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis (1999) for more discussion.
6
The individual fixed effects in our sample are estimates based on data through the year 1998. In our
empirical work below, we report some earnings equations based on our own sample of data from 1996-98
and also from 1999-2001. Clearly, our empirical work using the latter sample is not subject to any concerns
about the use of fixed effects wage measures that have been estimated over part of the time same period.
Results over the two time periods are generally quite consistent with one another, as we note below.

9

The firm fixed effect similarly captures a variety of factors. Most simplistically, it
captures the premium or discount that a given firm pays workers on average, controlling
for their individual characteristics. This premium might be due to a higher level of capital
in the firm, which would clearly increase the productivity of individual workers. Or, it
might be due to unionization -- the transportation equipment industry, for example, has a
relatively high average firm fixed effect. It might also be a compensating differential -the high average firm fixed effect in the mining industry is presumably in order to
compensate workers for the riskiness and unpleasantness of mine work. Finally, the firm
effect will capture a range of human resource policies chosen by the firm, including the
effects of training and promotion policies as well as compensation.
B) Sample Used Here and Definitions
Consistent with our earlier work (Andersson, Holzer and Lane, 2005), we use a
sample of LEHD data for five states in this study: California, Florida, Illinois, Maryland
and North Carolina. These were the first five states for which long panels of micro data
on both firms and workers were available to LEHD researchers. As we note below, we
use data over the period 1993-2001 for workers who were prime-age adults in 1993 and
who had at least minimal labor force attachment and earnings in each year. The result
was a sample that included roughly 18 million workers working in over 1 million firms
per year.
The demographic characteristics of the workforce in the LEHD data, both overall
and within these five states, are very similar to those of the decennial Census. There are,
however, a few differences. The LEHD data used here have a high proportion of younger
workers overall (about 20%), than do either the five state Census sample or the full

10

Census, which may be due to coverage and reporting differences. The five states which
we are studying have a lower proportion of white workers than does the country at large - about 66% here rather than 78% for the nation. The industry distribution is, by and
large, very similar - although the LEHD data show more workers in professional services,
and fewer in educational, health and social services. The earnings in the five states are
typically slightly higher than for the country at large, but the LEHD earnings measures
are, on average, slightly lower -- probably primarily due to the coverage differences that
were mentioned earlier.
As pointed out in our book, there are a variety of considerations associated with
defining low earners on the basis of administrative data on quarterly and annual earnings
only. It is important to try to separate out individuals who voluntarily work part-time at
high wage from those who work full-time but at low wages, since UI wage records do not
provide information on hours or weeks worked. Similarly, from a policy perspective, it is
useful to separate those with transitory earnings difficulties - such as those returning to
the labor market after a lengthy absence or those who have recently been displaced from
a job — from those with persistent earnings difficulties over some number of years.
Similarly, when studying the impacts of temp agencies, it is also important to measure
impacts over a substantial period of time, so that transitory impacts can be separated from
persistent ones in the labor market.
The practical way in which we address the first of these challenges is to limit the
sample to one of prime-age workers - i.e., those aged 25 through 54 - at the beginning of
our period of analysis (1993). This at least partially eliminates the largest groups who are
most likely to work part-time — such as students and the elderly (and near-elderly).

11

While some groups of voluntary part-time workers — such as homemakers — will
remain in the sample, the analysis will provide breakouts by gender (and also by
race/ethnicity), thereby separating groups with many voluntary part-time workers (such
as white females) from others where there presumably are fewer.
The second practical challenge is to identify people who are both attached to the
labor market and persistently low earners. We address the attachment issue by only
including in our sample of low earners those who have worked for at least one quarter in
each year, and earn at least $2000 per year when doing so. These conditions are also
applied for the subsequent six years of the sample, which tends to omit those who left the
population of earners in a state for any number of reasons.7
We define persistently low earners as those who earn $12,000 per year or less for
each of 3 years during a three-year base period of 1993-95.8 The three-year base period
is long enough that we generally avoid those with strictly transitory problems, and focus
instead on those with persistent low earnings. The implications for our sample sizes, and
the characteristics of our sample (both in terms of employment outcomes, person fixed
effects, and temp agency employment) of these various sample restrictions are considered
in the Appendix. As expected, limiting the sample to persistently low earners in the base
period clearer reduces outcomes and personal skills (while raising the incidence of temp

7

Since each individual is required to appear in our data in each year of the analysis, we omit those who
move out of state, or who drop out of the labor force for other reasons.
8

Earnings are measured in 1998 dollars. We have used the CPI-U to deflate earnings over time. Though
this index is known to overstate the rate of inflation over time (e.g., Schultz, 2003), this will have no effect
on comparisons across groups in earnings or earnings growth in comparable time periods. We also have no
data on the pecuniary values of fringe benefits for employees; however, these data are routinely omitted
from calculations of poverty rates and the like. Inclusion of these measures would, if anything, exacerbate
measured inequality across groups (Hamermesh, 1998).

12

agency employment, as we note below); but further limiting the sample in subsequent
years beyond the base period has little effect on any of these measures.
In any event, after analyzing temp agency employment during the base period, we
then examine labor market outcomes for low earners, and especially the impact of temp
employment during the base period, in the six years subsequent to the base period. We
also divide the six-year period into two 3-year periods, 1996-98 and 1999-2001. This
enables us to examine the stability of these subsequent labor market outcomes for a
lengthy period of time, and separate out transitory from more persistent impacts.
The $12,000 cutoff for low earnings may seem somewhat arbitrary, but we have
an extended discussion in our earlier work (Andersson, Holzer and Lane 2005) in which
we discuss the basis for, and implications of, this cutoff.9 The bottom line is that we find
that the $12,000 cutoff generates a sample of workers whose personal and family
characteristics approximate those in which we are most interested.10 However, we also
consider those in an intermediate category of earnings in the base period (whom we call
“occasionally low earners”), who earn less than $12,000 a year for at least one but not all
of the three years in the base period.

IV. Results
A. Summary Statistics

9

During this time period, a family relying on the earnings of a single worker earning $12,000 or less would
clearly have income below the poverty line for a family of three, and even below the poverty line for a
family of four if potential eligibility for the Earned Income Tax Credit were taken into account. Varying
this cutoff in our earlier work never affected our qualitative results.
10
See the Appendix to Chapter 4 of our book, where we consider the educational characteristics and family
incomes of workers from a smaller sample of LEHD workers who are matched to Current Population
Survey (CPS) data, and who are persistently low earners by our definition. The vast majority of these
workers had education levels of high school or less, and had family incomes below twice the poverty line.

13

We begin with some data on the use of temp agencies by workers during our
three-year base period (1993-95). In Table 1 we present summary data on the incidence
of temp employment for all workers as well as separately by their earnings status in the
base period - namely, for persistently low earners, occasionally low earners, and non-low
earners.11 We also present these results for individuals who had any employment through
a temp agency over a three-year period, as well as for those who had temporary agencies
as their primary source of employment over that period.
Our results show that, over a three-year period, roughly 8 percent of the sample’s
entire prime-age workforce has had some employment through a temporary agency –
though only about 1 percent of the workforce had temp agencies as their primary
employer over that period. However, when the sample is limited to include only
persistently low earners, it is clear that temp agencies play a much greater role in securing
employment for these workers than for the workforce overall – with 16 percent of all
such low earners having some temp experience during those three years and about 4
percent having temp work as their primary source of employment. Temp employment for
the “occasionally low earners” is very similar to that of workers whose earnings
“persistently low,” but it is considerably lower for the “non-low earners,” with 4 percent
of this latter group having any temp experience and less than 1 percent working primarily
for temps.
In Table 2 we consider the personal characteristics of those who work for temp
agencies during our base period. Once again, we consider these characteristics for all
workers and for persistently low earners who have either worked for a temp agency or
11

“Persistently Low” earners are those who earned less than $12,000 per year (in 1998 dollars) for all three
years between 1993 and 1995; “Occasionally Low” had earnings less than $15,000 for at least some years;
and “Non-Low” earners had earnings above $15,000 for each of the three years.

14

not; and we separately consider any work through a temp agency v. temp work as a
primary source of employment. For all of these groups, we present data on the gender
(female), age groups (25-34, 35-44, or 45-54), and race of such workers, as well as
whether they are foreign born. We also tabulate the mean person fixed effects of workers
in each category.
A number of findings appear in Table 2. Among workers of all earnings
categories, those working at temp agencies are generally younger, more likely to be
minority (especially black), and more likely to have below-average personal earnings
characteristics (i.e., fixed effects) than those not working at temp agencies.
Among those workers with persistently low earnings, those who work at temp
agencies are still more likely to be young or black. But we also find that low earners who
work for temp agencies are also more likely to be male, to be native-born, and to have
above-average personal characteristics than those not working for temps. In other words,
the self-selection mechanisms into temporary employment are somewhat different among
low earners than among others, with somewhat more positive self-selection into temp
agencies occurring among low earners, suggesting that it is important to control for such
forms of selection in regression analysis, if possible.
Once these workers spend some time working for temp agencies during the threeyear base period, how likely are they to continue with this form of employment in
subsequent years? The answer to this question obviously has important implications for
the issue of the extent to which temp agencies help workers – and especially low earners
– transition to more stable and perhaps higher-wage employment later on.

15

Table 3 presents data on the extent to which those who worked for temp agencies
during the base period – either with any amount of temp employment or as their primary
form of work – continue to work for temp agencies during the subsequent three years or
six years. These data thus constitute elements of transition matrices for those at temp
agencies during the base period, which shed light on the persistence of such employment
over long periods of time. Once again, the data appear for all workers at temp agencies
and only for those who were persistently low earners during the base period.
The results of Table 3 show some persistence over time in the attachment of
workers to temp agencies, though large majorities of these workers no longer use temps
by the period 1999-2001. For instance, among all workers who used temp agencies at any
point in the base period, roughly 40 percent still use them at some point over the 1996-98
period, and about a fourth still do so during 1999-2001. Among those for whom temp
agencies constituted the primary employer in the base period, persistence is even greater
– with about 61 and 37 percent respectively having some temp employment in the 199698 and 1999-2001 periods. Also, those who were low earners in the base period and who
used temp employment show modestly higher persistence in temp agency use than do
workers overall, though qualitatively the pattern is quite similar for low earners.
In any event, the impacts of temp agencies on subsequent advancement for low
earners will likely depend heavily on whether workers who used temps in the base period
continue to do so subsequently, and this factor must be taken into account when we do
our multivariate analysis of earnings gains for temp users over time below.
Having analyzed the personal characteristics of temp workers and the persistence
of temp employment over time, we now consider a range of employment outcomes

16

among these workers – both during the base period and in the subsequent three- and sixyear periods. For here onward, we focus exclusively on those who were persistently low
earners during the base period – as this is the group for whom temp agency might be
considered a stepping-stone to more stable and successful job opportunities.
In Table 4 we present a set of employment outcomes for those who used temp
agencies for employment during the base period and those who did not. We present the
outcomes for the base period, and also for the two subsequent 3-year periods. The
outcomes we consider are: a) The number of quarters during which the individual was
employed over the three-year period – a rough measure of overall employment activity;
b) The number of full quarters worked with any employer during that time-period, which
measures employment instability; c) The quarters of job tenure accumulated in their
primary job during this period, or a measure of employment stability; d) Average
quarterly earnings during the three-year period; e) Average quarterly earnings for full
quarters worked with any employer during such a period; and f) Average annual earnings.
Once again, these are presented separately for those with or without any temp
employment in the base period, and for those with or without such employment as their
primary source of work. And, in the two subsequent periods, we present results separately
for the full samples of originally low earners (panels B and D) and for those omitting
temp workers in the current period (panels C and E).
A number of findings appear in Table 4. During the base period, those low earners
who work at temp agencies work a bit less (in terms of quarters of employment), and are
considerably less likely to work full quarters for their employers or to generate significant
job tenure on these jobs. Their quarterly earnings in this time period are not greatly

17

different from those without such work, though their annual earnings are consistently
lower (especially among those for whom such employment is their primary source of
work over the base period).12
What happens to these low-earning workers over the subsequent three or six years
in the labor market? Those who worked for temp agencies earlier on (of whom we now
know that only a small fraction still work for temps) still work fewer full quarters for
specific employers and therefore accumulate less tenure on any job. But now their
earnings are higher than those of low earners who did not work for temp agencies
earlier. Specifically, those with any temp agency employment in the base period now
earn 8-9 percent more per quarter than those without such experience, and 9-14 percent
more for full-quarter employment or annual employment. For those whose primary
employment was through temp agencies in the base period, the positive earnings
differentials relative to those without such work are fairly comparable (though just
slightly smaller in most cases).
Among those who do not work in temp agencies in the subsequent periods, the
earnings of earlier temp workers relative to non-temp workers are even larger.13 And, in
tabulations not included in Table 4, we find these earnings gains among both women and
men who were low earners in the base period, and among those of each racial/ethnic
group - though the gains associated with earlier temp employment are somewhat larger
for women than for men and for minorities than whites.14
12

Since we are truncating the earnings distribution at a fairly low level when generating this sample, it is
not surprising that earnings differences between those working and not working at temp agencies during
this period are modest.
13
Panels C and E show earnings that are 12-19 percent higher among those who had earlier worked in temp
agencies during 1996-98 and 9-15 percent higher in 1999-2001.
14
For instance, full quarterly earnings are 16 percent higher among women and 7 percent higher among
men in 1996-98 among low earners who worked in temp agencies in 1993-95 (when their earnings were

18

Do these subsequent earnings advantages persist over time? During the second
subsequent three-year period, those who had worked for temp agencies continue to have
lower numbers of full quarters worked and less tenure accumulated, but they still earn
more than those who did not - with differentials that are just a bit smaller than during the
first subsequent period. Now we find quarterly earnings that are about 5-6 percent higher
among temp workers than among non-temp workers, full quarter earnings that are about
8-10 percent higher, and annual earnings that are 5-6 percent higher. Thus, most of the
earnings advantages associated with earlier temp work seem to persist over time.
Of course, these summary statistics on earnings do not control for personal
characteristics, and we observed above (in Table 2) that there is positive self-selection
into temporary employment among low earners in the labor market. We consider below
whether or not the subsequently higher earnings among temp workers are still evident
after controlling for observable differences in personal characteristics.
But, before we move to our regression analysis, we consider some data on the
differences in job characteristics of low earners in the base period who work for temp
agencies and those who do not – with the job characteristics presented for the base period
and also for subsequent periods. In Table 5 we present data on the industries and firm
fixed effects of employers of these different groups of workers. Once again, we present
results for the base period and for the two subsequent periods, and separately for full
samples and for those omitting current temp workers in the latter periods.

only 8 percent and 2 percent higher respectively). Full quarterly earnings are 17 percent higher among
whites, 12 percent higher among blacks and 11 percent among Hispanics in 1996-98 respectively among
those who worked for temp agencies in 1993-95 (when their earnings were only 10 percent, 2 percent and 2
percent higher respectively). The gains associated with earlier temp work are thus higher for women than
for men but higher for minorities than whites among low earners in the base period.

19

The results suggest that, during the base period, low earners working for temp
agencies were much less likely to work in agriculture, retail trade, and other services. To
a lesser extent, this remains true in the subsequent periods as well, because of the
persistence of temp agency employment across these periods. But, in subsequent periods,
those who worked for temp agencies in the base period are also now more heavily
concentrated in a variety of higher-wage industries – notably durable manufacturing, but
also to some extent in construction, nondurable manufacturing, transportation/utilities
and wholesale trade. This remains true even in the period 1999-2001, with the data
showing relatively little erosion of this effect between the first and second subsequent
periods. Indeed, by 1996-98, 26% of previously low earners who had any temp work in
the base period had jobs in these higher-wage industries, compared with only 18% of
previously low earners who had no temp work in the base period. By 1999-2001 the
proportions were roughly the same, at 28 percent v. 19 percent; the differences between
those whose primary employment was in a temp agency and those for whom it was not
are similar (though slightly smaller). And these differences are all considerably larger in
the samples that exclude current temp workers than in those that include them.
Furthermore, in the subsequent periods, those who worked for temp agencies in
the base period now work for employers with higher firm fixed effects than those who did
not work for temp agencies. This was true to a small extent during the base period, but in
subsequent periods, the gaps between the firm fixed effects of low earners do did and did
not work for temp agencies in the base period respectively has grown. This is a critical
finding, and suggests that temp agencies act as labor market intermediaries to link low
earners to better employers than those whom they might be able to find on their own.

20

And, once again, there is only modest evidence of erosion in the magnitude of this effect
between 1996-98 and 1999-2001.
B. Regression Equations for Earnings in Subsequent Periods
The extent to which employment in these higher-wage industries and firms might
account for the stronger employment outcomes in subsequent periods for low earners
who initially worked at temp agencies, especially once we control for other personal
characteristics, must now be ascertained.
In Tables 6 and 7 we present the results of estimated regression equations of the
following form for those who were low earners in the base period:

2) ln(EARN)ij,t+l = f(TEMPit, TEMPi,t+l, Xi, Xi,t+l, TENij,t+l, TIMEt+l; Xj) + uij,t+l

where EARN represents quarterly earnings, TEMP represents employment at a temp
agency, TEN represents job tenure, TIME represents quarter dummies, X represents a
variety of characteristics; i, j, and t denote the person, firm and time period respectively;
and l takes on the values of 1 or 2, depending on whether the observation is in the first or
second of the three-year periods subsequent to the base period.
In other words, we have estimated earnings equations across person-quarters,
separately for the period 1996-98 and 1999-2001. We are primarily interested in the
coefficients (and t statistics) on employment at temp agencies during the base period,
which is what we present in those tables. All other variables appear as controls.15

15

These regressions are based on random 10% samples of the full populations that meet our sampling
criteria; sample sizes are thus about 1/10 of those that appear in the Appendix for the two subsequent
periods.

21

In Table 6 we present five specifications of each equation. In the first, we control
for observable fixed characteristics such as race/gender and foreign born status, as well as
age; and time (quarter). In the second we add a control for current employment at a temp
agency. In the third, we replace the fixed personal characteristics noted above with a
person fixed effect. In the fourth we add a control for tenure in the current job. Finally, in
the fifth, we add the firm fixed effect. These different specifications shed light on how
our results might be influenced by the omission or inclusion of all of these variables,
since it seems that temp employment in the base period draws workers with different
personal characteristics than the overall population of low earners, and since temp
employment may or may not causally affect not only subsequent job tenure and firm
characteristics but also subsequent temp employment,.
Separate equations have been estimated for all earnings and for full quarter
earnings (in the latter case, the sample is restricted only to individual workers’ personquarters of full quarter employment with any particular firm). Separate estimates are also
provided for those with any temp employment in the base period v. those whose primary
employment was through the temp agency, and also for 1996-98 v. 1999-2001. Also,
Table 6 presents results for all workers who were persistently low earners in the base
period, while Table 7 presents them only for non-temp workers in the subsequent 3-year
periods.16
Overall, the estimated effects of temp employment for low earners in the base
period on their subsequent earnings are somewhat varied. The estimates for all earnings
are quite mixed, with primary employment at a temp agency showing more positive

16

Table 7 thus contains just four specifications, since the second one from Table 6 is omitted.

22

effects than any temp employment; but the effects of temp employment on full quarter
earnings are uniformly positive.
Without controlling for current temp employment, effects on all earnings are
negative , though still positive for those with full quarter earnings only. Controlling for
current temp activity makes the results for all earnings considerably less negative, and
even positive for those with primary temp employment in the base period. Controlling for
person fixed effects consistently makes the estimated effects of temp agencies less
positive, by 2-4 log points; this is consistent with the notion of some positive selfselection into temp employment among low earners. Controlling for tenure has mixed
effects, making the estimates more positive for all earnings (consistent with the shorter
tenure among temp users that we observed in earlier tables) but less positive for those
with full quarter earnings (implying longer tenure among temp users who have full
quarter employment). Also, the estimated effects of current temp agency employment are
large and negative in all equations (not shown in the tables), but controlling for these
makes the effects of previous temp employment more positive as well.
Controlling for current temp status and also for job tenure, all of the estimated
effects of temp agencies on either earnings measure are positive. Thus, both the estimates
for full quarter earnings and those controlling for tenure show that temp agencies have
positive effects on the earnings of low earners who manage to transition to stable nontemp employment afterwards. And, while some – though not all – of the positive
estimated effects of temp employment diminish between the first and second 3-year
periods after the base period, at least some positive effects persist over time, suggesting
that the positive effects are not purely short-term.

23

But all of the positive estimates become much smaller (or even negative) once we
control for firm fixed effects. Indeed, controlling for firm characteristics consistently
reduces the positive impacts of temp agencies by about 7 log points. In other words, most
of the positive effects of temp agencies on subsequent earnings of low earners occur
because they improve the access of these workers to higher-wage employers. This is
consistent with the results reported in Andersson et al. (2005).
When we consider the effects of earlier temp employment on those not working
as temps in the subsequent periods in Table 7, we generally find much more positive
effects of earlier temp employment than in Table 6. As before, results for those with fullquarter earnings are positive and quite large – with earlier temp employment raising
subsequent earnings by 20-30 log points in 1996-98 and 16-20 log points in 1999-2001.
For those with any earnings, the effects remain mixed but are clearly positive after
controlling for job tenure. And controlling for firm fixed effects now reduces the
estimated effects of early temp employment by 9-13 log points.
To see more clearly the apparent positive impact of temp employment on the
quality of firms to which workers get matched subsequently, we present estimates of
early temp employment on the firm fixed effects in 1996-98 and 1999-2001 in Table 8.
As before, estimates appear for full-quarter earnings only and for all earnings, and for any
earlier temp employment as well as primary employment during the base period. Results
from two specifications are presented: the first in which we control for observable
personal characteristics (i.e., race/gender and foreign born status), and the second
controlling for person fixed effects. As in Table 7, those who still work with temp
agencies in the subsequent periods are removed from the sample.

24

The results show quite substantial positive effects of early temp employment on
the subsequent quality of firms to which low-earning workers are matched. For all
earners, firm fixed effects are 9-14 percentage points higher among those who earlier had
worked for temp agencies; among those with full-quarter earnings, firm fixed effects are
9-18 percentage points higher. Thus, for those making successful transitions to stable
post-temp employment, access to higher-wage firms is improved by having worked for a
time with a temp agency.

V. Conclusion
Using new longitudinal data from the Census Bureau on the universe of UIcovered workers and their employers in five states, we have estimated the effects of temp
employment on the earnings of persistently low earners over a subsequent six-year
period.
Our results show that temp earners clearly have lower earnings than others while
working at these agencies; and even their subsequent earnings are somewhat mixed. But
these earnings are generally higher if they manage to gain stable employment with other
employers. In particular, we find that the effects of temp agency employment in the base
period on subsequent earnings are uniformly positive for those reporting full-quarter
earnings, and for all earnings once we control for job tenure.
While there is some positive self-selection among low earners into temp
employment, controlling for person fixed effects does not completely eliminate the
positive effects associated with temp employment. Furthermore, the positive effects seem
mostly to occur because those working for temp agencies subsequently work for higher-

25

wage firms than do comparable low earners who do not work for temps. And the positive
effects we estimate seem to persist over time, for as much as six years beyond the base
period during which the temp employment was observed.
Thus, our results are consistent with the notion that low earners, in addition to
any deficiencies in skills that they bring to the labor market, sometimes have difficulty
“matching” themselves to higher-wage employers in the labor market. This might reflect
employer discrimination, their own limited information and informal contacts in the labor
market, transportation and geographic “mismatch,” or other problems.
But temp agencies, and perhaps other labor market intermediaries, can help these
workers overcome these problems and gain access to better employers across their
regional labor markets. By providing the initial contact with employers, these
intermediaries can perhaps overcome transportation and informational barriers that limit
initial access (Giloth, 2003); and by providing information about worker quality and
previous performance that might be unobservable to employers on their own, they might
overcome discriminatory behaviors among employers (Holzer et al., 2003). Indeed, the
results suggest that such intermediaries might play a significant role in a strategy of
helping the working poor advance in the labor market by moving them into better jobs
over time, as long as such placements can be combined with appropriate job training and
support services (Holzer, 2004; Holzer and Martinson, 2005).
Our results are thus consistent with much of the earlier literature on temp agencies
that we reviewed above, though somewhat less consistent with the recent work by Autor
and Houseman in Detroit which suggested that any positive effects are spurious or
transitory. On the other hand, even in their work, contractors who placed TANF

26

recipients into permanent jobs also generated positive impacts on earnings that persisted
over time. In this broader sense, the results of Autor and Houseman are quite consistent
with our results here, suggesting that temps and/or other intermediaries who manage to
achieve more permanent job placements for their workers can have positive impacts.
Of course, we have not fully eliminated possible self-selection effects regarding
temps, since person fixed effects do not control for any time-varying characteristics of
these individuals. But, combined with the clear evidence that temp agencies result in
subsequent employment at higher-wage firms, our findings at least suggest that the
positive effects of temp agencies or other intermediaries on the job-matching process for
low earners might be real and persistent.

Note: “Any Temp Employment” and “Primary Temp Employment” refer only to the
base period; thus, outcomes for 1996-98 and 1999-2001 are conditioned on temp
employment during the base period (1993-95). Results for the latter period are also
presented with temp workers in those periods included (panels B and D) or excluced
(panels C and E).

Note: The dependent variable in these regression equations is ln(quarterly earnings). Observations are
person-quarters. The samples are restricted to those with full-quarter employment with any employer for
results listed as “full-quarter.” Each equation also includes controls for age and time dummies. Regressions
are based on a 10% random sample of the relevant population (as described in the Appendix).
