What Promises Are Worth:
The Impact of Affirmative Action Goals

ABSTRACT

Affirmative action goals and timetables for the employment of
minorities and females have been criticized by some as being ineffective,

and by others as being a system of rigid quotas. Using new data from OFCCP
administrative records, this paper estimates the impact of detailed regula-

tory pressure on goals and on subsequent employment demographics. It also
tests for the information content of the goals.
While the goals are inflated and are not being fulfilled with the
rigidity one might expect of quotas, the establishments that promise to
employ more minorities and females do actually employ more in subsequent

years. While the detailed enforcement tools of the compliance review process are of doubtful utility, the system of affirmative action goals does
appear to have prompted increases in minority and female employment at
reviewed establishments.

The goals and timetables for the employment of minorities and females drawn
from federal contractors under affirmative action stand accused on two mutually

inconsistent charges. The first is that "goal" is really just an expedient and polite
word for quota. Affirmative action has really imposed inflexible quotas for minority
and female employment. The second is that these goals are worth less than the paper

they are written on. Affirmative action is a game played for paper stakes, and has
never been enforced stringently enough to produce significant results. This paper
attempts to bring fresh empirical evidence to bear on the controversial question of
the actual impact of affirmative action goals.

Under Executive Order 11246, federal contractors are required to take affirmative

action not to discriminate, and to develop affirmative action plans (AAPs) including
goals and timetables for good-faith efforts to correct deficiencies in minority and
female employment. The aim of this paper is to measure good-faith, to determine what

affirmative action promises are worth. Is negotiation over affirmative action goals an

empty charade played with properly penciled forms, or does it in fact lead to more
jobs for minorities and females in the contractor sector? If the latter is the case, are
these goals so strictly adhered to as to constitute quotas?
This paper contains four sections. The first section reviews past work and estab-

lishes the institutional setting of affirmative action. The second section develops an
analysis of the formation of goals arid the impact of government policy in the context

of a model of the supply and demand for labor. It then discusses the characteristics

of the data underlying this study. The third section presents our central empirical
findings in five stages. It first presents simple comparisons of goals with realizations

on average. It then estimates the impact of detailed affirmative action enforcement

tools on minority and female employment in reduced form equations of the labor
market. The information content of affirmative action goals are then formally tested,
followed by estimates of the impact of government policy on the formation of goals. At

-2the end of this section, we return to the question of the impact of goals on minority
and female employment. Taken together, the evidence to be presented here suggests
that while many of the detailed enforcement tools are of doubtful utility, the system of
affirmative action goals has prompted increases in minority arid female employment.
I. The Regulatory Setting

Detailed regulations to enforce affirmative action under Executive Order 11246,
including numerical goals, were not introduced until 1969 after the Comptroller Gen-

eral ruled that the affirmative action obligation was too vague to satisfy the require-

ment that minimum contract standards be made clear to prospective bidders. Such
numerical goals were first embodied in the manning tables of the Cleveland and Phi-

ladelphia Plans for construction contractors. These measurable standards against
which to monitor compliance were extended to non-construction contractors in 1970,

and have since won the .tacit approval of Congress and the Courts. The regulations
require that every contractor maintain an affirmative action plan consisting in part of
a utilization analysis indicating areas of minority arid female employment in which the

employer is deficient, along with goals and timetables for good-faith efforts to correct
deficiencies.

While rio one has ever studied the usefulness of these affrmative action goals as a

regulatory tool, the impact of the cont.ract compliance program as a whole has been
analyzed five times in the past. For black males, Burrnan, Ashenfelter and I-leekman,

Heckman and Wolpin, and Leonard all conclude that employment increases faster at

establishments that are federal contractors. For females, a positive impact has not
been clearly established. Heckman and Wolpin, and Goldstein and Smith find the pro-

gram ineffective, while Leonard finds mixed evidence. Considering the marginal
impact of compliance reviews, Burman, and Heckman and Wolpin both find them
ineffective in the late 60's and early 70's, while Leonard finds a positive impact on both

minority and female employment in the late 70's, and suggests that. the expanded

-3supply of skilled minorities and females, as well as more aggressive enforcement
helped account for the improvement in effectiveness over time. Since the reviews
examined here have already been shown to be useful, the question here is not "Are
reviews effective ?", but rather "Do promises extracted during the review process con-

tribute to the impact of reviews?".

It is not beyond reason to suppose that they do not. Neither the penalties for
inflating promises to hasten the departure of federal inspectors nor the prospects of
being apprehended seem great. The ultimate sanction available to the government in

the case of affirmative action is debarment, in which a firm is barred from holding
federal contracts. The first debarment of a non-construction contractor did not take

place until 1974, and in total only 26 firms have ever been debarred. If the OFCCP

finds the establishment's affirmative action plan unacceptable, it may issue a show

cause notice as a preliminary step to higher sanctions. This step has been taken in
only I to 4 percent of all reviews. (USCCR, 1974, p.297). Of these, one-third to onehalf involve basic and blatant paperwork deficiencies such as the failure to prepare or
update an AAP. (USGAO, 1975, p.26).

The other major sanction used by the OFCCP is backpay awarded as part of a con-

ciliation agreement. In 1973 and 1974, $54 million was awarded in 91 settlements,
averaging $63 per beneficiary. (USGAO, 1975, p.46). In 1980, in all even more skewed

distribution, $9.2 million was awarded to 4336 employees in 743 conciliation agreements. (USCCR, 1982, p.47). These beneficiaries represented less than two tenths of
one percent of all protected group employees at just the reviewed establishments1.

The low penalties if caught are compounded by the low probability of apprehension, although the Department of Defense (DOD), upon whose reviews this paper con-

centrates, had one of the most vigorous programs. In 1976, DOD reviewed 24 percent
of its identified contractors, compared to an average for all compliance agencies of 11
percent. (USCCR, 1977, p.113). Tn 1977, DOD had a ratio of 42 contractor facilities per

-4staff member, and a total budget of 345 per contractor. (USCCR, 1977, p.107). Strikingly, compliance reviews have not typically been targeted directly against discrimina-

tion. An establishment's history of employment demographics has typically not played

a role in the incidence of compliance reviews, for a reason as procedurally obvious as
it.

is logically obscure: compliance officers have not, generally looked at an

establishment's past AAFS or EEO-1 forms in targeting reviews. Heckman and Wolpin

report that reviews are essentially random with respect to the level or growth rates of

an establishment's demographics. Leonard finds evidence that establishments with
more blacks or females are actually rriore likely to he reviewed.

In this light, the expected penalties for making promises to the government with
little regard for the likelihood of fulfilling those promises do not seem overwhelming.

In such circumstances, affirmative action promises may contain little if any information about, the establishment's future employment. On the other hand, the OFCCP may

use more subtle and less easily observed pressures. Firms may care about their reputations, not only with the OFCCP but also with their own employees and the public, and

so strive to set reasonable goals. More importantly, firms may react to the threat of
Title VII litigation, with its substantial legal costs and penalties, hanging over their

heads while under affirmative action review.
11. Models and Data

To understand the impact of regulatory pressure on affirmative action goals, and

the impact of these in turn on market realizations, we niodel both the labor market
and the formulation of goals. The inverse demand for labor is:
W'f31D â€”f2P + 3G +

e1

where
P

is the number of workers of a given type demanded as a
proportion of all workers.

(1)

-5G

is an indicator of affirmative action regu]atory pressure.

B

is a demand shifter

W is the wage for workers of a given type.
The inverse supply function is given by:
+

2p

(2)

where:

P

is the number of workers of a given type supplied.

as a proportion of all workers
S

is a supply shifter
In equilibrium W5= WV, so solving out we find:

+ 3G + 615 + e1 â€” e2}

(3)

We shall use this reduced form equation to estimate the impact of detailed
affirmative action regulatory pressure on minority and female employment.

Let P' be the projection firms would report if they had symmetric loss functions

about true P. in other words rational expectations. P' would then be given by the
expected value of P in equation 3 above. Now let b the goal reported by companies.
We shall present below estimates of a standard test of P against the null hypothesis of

rational expectations:
(4)

If firms are reporting the expected value of P as their goal, the rational expectations
hypothesis will hold, giving atphaO and beta=1. This in itself tells us nothing about
the impact of policy, since both the goal and actualization condition on actual policy.

At the other extreme, if firms' goals have no information content, then b2ta 0. This

-6possible finding would have a direct policy implication: the goals elicited from firms

under affirmative action are useless because they have no relation to subsequent
employment patterns.
To interpret the information content of goals in cases between the extremes of
beta = 1 or beta =0, we model goals as given by the fol.]owing equation, which will be

considered a reduced form equation for goals, bLit one of a set of structural equations

for realizations.
(5)

P=X1D + X2G + AS + e
We

shall us this equation to estimate the impact of regulatory pressure on goals.

The impact of regulatory pressure on market demands both directly and
indirectly through goals is identified in the reduced form equation 3 . In the quest for
identification, however, this reduced form estimate throws away most of the informriaA

DATA

The next section will present estimates of the rate of change in the employment
share of minorities and females in a sample of establishments that were subjected to
affirmative action compliance reviews in the late 1970's. This study relies on informa-

tion gathered by the OFCCP during compliance reviews2. The work-force analysis in

these reports includes past, current, and projected employment by occupation, race,
and sex at each establishment. The employment totals used here are the summations

across occupations. The projections are typically one-year ahead forecasts, so by
using data from reviews in consecutive years we can compare year ahead projections
with consequent realizations3.

-7lit The More They Promise, The More They Do

The employment goals that rms agree to ur1der affirmative action are not vacuous; neither are they adhered to as strictly as quotas. This section will show that while
affirmative action promises are inflated, they are not. hollow,

The sample means of absolute emnployrneni. by denniographic group by year are

shown in Table 1. The mode year for which projections are made is 1976. The first
finding in Table 1. is that establishnients on average overestimate the growth of tot:al

employment. They project one percent employment growth one year ahead, but
eniployment consequently falls by three percent. From a macroeconomic perspective

this is striking for two reasons. First, 1976, the year for which most, projections are
made, was a year in which real GNP grew by 5.4 percent coming out of a recession, and

total ernploymer.it grew by 3.4 percent. Peculiarly, these reviewed contractor establishments were not only left behind by the rising tide, they continued to sink. This is
consistent with previous evidence that reviewed contractors shrank between 1974 and

1960, and may in part be due to the concentration of these sar.npled reviews in the
durable goods manufacturing sector.
Second, this observed overestimation of employment growth conflicts with a pre-

vious finding that during the past two decades firms tended to underestimate wage

increases in part because they underestimated growth in labor demand. Part of the

discrepancy may easily arise because in the context of a compliance review firms
inflate minority and female employment well beyond their true expectations. However,

this cannot be the full explanation because even whit,e male employment falls more

than projected. If the projections were being manipulated to result in the greatest
projected increase in minority and female share, then we would not expect to see, as
we do, firms underestimate the decline in white male employment.

The second finding of interest in Table I is that neither absolute minority nor
female employment increased, but that both minority and female employment shares

-8did increase. This is because the contraction in employment that did occur was
almost lily-white and predominantly male. Most of the average employment decline of

27 was accounted for by white males, whose employment fell by 21. Put another way,

while white males averaged 57 percent of initial employment, they accounted for 78
percent of the employment decline. Since females and niinorities typically have lower

seniority, they are usually found to suffir disproportionately more during a downturn.

In this perspective, the finding here that, white males accounted for most of the
employment decline is itself striking evidence of the impact of affirmative action.

These establishrxients are projecting swift and substantial increascs in black male

employment. If the one year projections in Table 1 are extrapolated for ten years,
then fully 14 percent of the workforce at these plants would be black males.

These projections and actualizations can also be expressed as shares of total
employment. Over time, minority and female employment shares are indeed growing,

but not. nearly so fast as projected. The firms project growth in minority and fern-ale

employment share far in excess of their own past. history, and far in excess of what
what they will actually fulfill. Is there then any information at all in their projections,
or is the entire procedure an exercise in futility?
Heduced Form Estimates of the Impact of Policy

'l'his section makes use of the richly detailed data available in UFCCP records to

ask whether greater regulatory pressure results directly in better actual performance. We shall later examine the affirmative action bargaining process itself, and ask

the related question: what types and levels of regulatory pressure elicit bett.er prom-

ised performance? Section II derived the reduced form equation for a model of the
demand and supply of labor. Table 2 presents estimates of the impact of regulatory
pressure on employment in this reduced form. These are regressions. weighted by ini-

tial establishment size, of the realized growth rate in demographic group employment

share on the actual growth rate lagged one year, a vector of enforcement variables,

-9and vectors of binary variables indicating year and SMSA4.

The regulation variables may be divided into two classes: those that indicate initial deficiencies or non-compliance in affirmative action plans, and those that indicate

higher levels or regulatory pressure and thc resolution of plan deficiencies5. For both

classes the results are mixed and often insignificant. One might. expect. greater
growth in protected group employment in the case of pre-award compliance reviews

-reviews mandated prior to the final award of large federal contracts- supposedly
because the carrot is dangling so close to the nose. On the other hand, few contracts

have ultimately been lost in this process, and the courts have been loathe to uphold

the use of this type of leverage. 29 percent of all the reviews studied here are preaward reviews, but only in the case of black females did they make a significant positive addition to protected group employment share beyond that expected trorri a regular review.

Among the indicators of initial deficiencies in atflrmative action plans, eight
establishments were found to be riot, in compliance. As expected, protected group
employment grows slower at these establishments, but this is only significant. in the
ease of white females. Table 2 also includes three additional variables indicating more

specific deficiencies found in EEO policies, in composition of the workforce, and in

goals and timetables. Such deficiencies are commonly found. 56 percent of all the
AAPs studied here were classified by federal inspectors as having deficiencies in their

goals and timetables. In only a few cases are these deficiencies comptetely resolved
during a given compliance review. In general, establishments that are deficient do not

differ significantly in their subsequent demographics from others. White males
employment does grow significantly faster at establishments with deficient EEO poli-

cies, and black female employment does grow significantly slower at those with
deficient goals and timetables.

Raving controlled for the initial level of deficiencies, as well as for past growth

- to rates, we can now ask what impact higher levels of regulatory pressure beyond the ini-

tial review have on subsequent employment patterns. The first of these are a set of
variables indicating the resolution of deficiencies in policies, composition, or goals and

timetables. Such deficiencies were resolved during the given review in at most 113
establishments, and had a mixed effect. As expected, the employment of white males

grew significantly slower, and that of while females significantly faster, where
deficiencies in goals and timetables were resolved. On the other hand, this variable

was insignificant for other groups. Resolving deficient EEO policies significantly
increased black male employment growth, hut had a perverse effect on white males
and white females. Resolving deficient workforce composition had a significant per-

verse impact on black males and white females, and was insignificant in other eases.
Note also that the OFCCP spent an average of SB man-hours in conducting the reviews

in this sample, with a range between 5 and 1006 hours. Controlling for size, additional
hours had a positive but insignificant impact on protected group employment.

One third of the establishment were required to make interim progress reports.
This marginally greater pressure had no significant impact on their subsequent demo-

graphics. 122 establishments, three percent of the total, signed conciliation agreements to remedy deficiencies in their AAPs. Perhaps their AAPs looked better, but
their subsequent demographics did not. Only the growth rate of white male employment was significantly different at establishments with conciliation agreements, and it
was higher.

The ultimate enforcement tool at the Department of Labor's disposal is debar-

ment, but none of the few actual uses of this deterrent show up in our sample. The
strongest pressure observed here is a show-cause notice. 24 establishments received

such notices offering them the opportunity to show cause why they should not be
debarred. On average, they had not significantly altered their demographics a year
later6. On the whole, there is no compelhng evidence here that these detailed corn-

- 11

-

ponents of the enforcement process have a significant impact on the employment of

members of protected groups7.
The Information Content of Affirmative Action Goals

Goals and timetables for protected group employment are a major component of

affirmative action policy. Are these affirmative action goals of any use in predicting

subsequent employment? Table 3 tests for the information content of these goals by
regressing the actual growth rate of employment share on the goal that. had been set
a year earlier. The results are very strong. The establishments are clearly not reporting as goals their rational expectations of employment share growth. As was obvious
from simply comparing the sample means of goals and realizations shown in Table 1,

these inflated goals far overstate subsequent achievements. On the other hand,
except for non-black minority males, these regressions show a significant relationship

between the goal and the realization. Knowledge of the goal is useful in determining
future demographics.
The Impact of Pressure on Goals

To judge the implication of this finding for policy, we must first ask what impact
regulatory pressure has on these goals. The answer, in nearly every case in Table 4, is

none that we can observe. Here the independent variables are the same as those in
the reduced form equations previously considered for realized growth rates of employ-

ment share, but the dependent variable is now the employment goal expressed as the

projected rate of change in demographic group employment share. These estimates
suggest that. of the enforcement tools considered, the only one that results in greater
goals is a conciliation agreement, and this only works for females.

Are we then driven to the inescapable conclusion that while goals do contain
significant information on subsequent achievenients, with few exceptions the govern-

ment can affect neither projected nor actual employment patterns? The argument

- 12

-

deserves closer examination.

Semi-Reduced Form Estimates

In the attempt to identify the impact of policy on employment, the reduced form
estimates in Table 2 throw out nearly all the information contained in the goals. This

can be clearly seen by considering the estimates in Table 4- as structural equations
explaining goals. Here the exogenous variables can only explain from 1 to 6 percent of

the variation n goals, are always insignificant independently, and sometimes
insignificant jointly. While this may simply mean that regulatory pressure, as well as
the other independent variables, has little impact on goals, a more likely explanation,
in my opinion, is that the few components of regulatory pressure that we can observe

have little explanatory power. Here we have a trade-off between identification and
information. Table 2 chose identification. Tab]e 5 choses information. These should

roughly bound the true impact. This table replicates the reduced form specification

with the addition of goals as an independent variable. It attempts to measure the
impact of policy on employment both directly, and indirectly through the formulation
of goals. The striking finding in Table 5 is that the affirmative action goal is the single

best predictor of subsequent employment demographics. It is far better than the
establishments own past history, even controlling for the direct impact of detailed
regulatory pressure.
This indicates that while establishments promise more than they deliver, the ones

that promise more do deliver more, even conditioning on the past growth rate of
employment share. In these regressions, weighting by initial size, of consequent actu-

alizations on the past years' actualizations and on last year's projection, the projection is significant in every case except non-black minority males. The central finding

of this paper is that there is significant information in the projection over and above

what could have been predicted on the basis of past history. On the other hand, the
coefficient is far from one; the projection falls far short of perfect information. For

- 13 example,

on average a projected eleven percentage point increase in the growth rate

of black male employment share results in an actual increase of one percentage point,
ceteris paribus8.

Establishments not only generally overprornise minority and female employment,

they also overpromise white male employment, This reveals something of their strategy in formulating promises. They do riot promise direct substitution of minority and

female workers for white Iriales, instead they promise more for all. More accurately,
they promise to make room for more minority and female employees by increasing the

size of the total employment pie. The first step in bringing these projections down to

earth may simply be to ask the establishment whether the projected growth in tota]
employment is reasonable9.

While establishments do overpredict one year ahead, the coefficient on the projec-

tion is genera]]y more significant than the coefficients on past actualizations. The

surprising finding is that the projection is usually the single best predictor of the
future. This does not necessarily indicate anything about the establishment's demand
for labor. It is possible that establishments forsee shifts in the supply of labor that we
cannot observe, and incorporate these into their goals. However, these equations control for both calendar year and SMSA. This explanation would require then that within

a given SMSA, during a particular year, some establishments can accurately project
particular supply shifts that will differentially afTect them. Assuming identical demand

elasticities, a general supply shift, such as an increase in the number of black males in

New York, would be reflected in the SMSA variable. It seems doubtful then that the

correlation of goals and market outcomes niere]y reects the accuracy of establishments in projecting establishment specific supply shocks that are unobservable to us.

Moreover, other work has shown that protected group employment share generally
grows faster in reviewed establishments during this period. There would be no reason
to expect this evidence of effective compliance reviews if firms were merely projecting

- 14

-

supply shifts.

W. Conclusions

Goals for the employment of minorities and females are an important product of

affirmative action bargaining. This process costs at least 5l million and perhaps
more than one billion a year in administrative costs alone. In 1980, the OFCCP's
authorized budget was 51 million. Past studies, some politically motivated, have
estimated direct costs of affirmative action on the order of 50 to $50 per employee.
Cumulating very roughly results in more than a billion dollars in direct compliance
costs for all non-construction contractors. Concerning just the direct costs Ã¼f cornpli-

ance reviews, a 1981 survey of 42 companies with an average workforce of 50,000
found that 80% of the reviewed were requested to submit data in addition to the AAP,
at an average cost of $3000.10 A similar survey by Senator Hatch's Labor Committee of

245 contractors with an average workforce of 2584 in 1981 reported that 60% were
asked to submit additional data beyond the AAP, at an average cost of $24,000.

The major finding here is that goals set in these costly negotiations do have a

measurable and significant correlation with improvements in the employment of
minorities and females at reviewed establishments. At the same time, these goals are
not being fulfilled with the rigidity one would expect of quotas. While the projections
of future employment of members of protected groups are inflated, the establishments
that promise to employ more d.o actually employ more.

On the basis of the evidence studied here, which is essentially the only direct evi-

dence brought to light on the question so far, it is clear that affirmative action goals

are strongly correlated with subsequent achievements. What ultimately cannot be
resolved with certainty here is the implication this has for policy beyond the impor-

tant observation that goals appear to be neither so vacuous nor so rigid as their critics on either side have supposed.

- 15 We

have a policy that appears to be efTective in its whole and inefTective in its

parts. The paperwork requirements of the AAP, the notification and resolution of AAP
deficiencies, and even conciliation agreements and show-cause notices appear to have

no general significant impact on affirmative action goals or on subsequent employment

demographics. On the other hand, protected group employment share does genera]ly
grow faster at reviewed firms, and goals are strongly correlated with this growth. Do

our results then indicate only that establishments' projections reflect variations in
supply known Lu them, rather than induced variations in demand? Alternatively, can
we infer that extracting greater promises will result in greater achievement,? The crit-

ical evidence here is that there is an overall response to pressure. Within labor mark-

ets of the sanie industry and region, reviewed contractors do better than nonreviewed, as other work shows. As we have seen here, within a given SMSA the estab-

lishments that set higher goals achieve higher growth rates of protected group
employment11. My reading of this evidence is that while much of the nit-picking over
paperwork is inefTective, the system of affirmative action goals has played a significant

role in improving employment opportunities for members of protected groups. One
expects the lofty goals generated by political accomodation to be accompanied. by lof-

tier promises. The surprising finding here is that in the case of affirmative action,
these promises are not, entirely empty.

Notes
1.

While these affirmative action sanctions have riot been heavily employed, in many

cases regulatory sanctions, like weapons of war, are judged most successful just

when they are used the least. That does not seem to be the case here. The IJS
Civil Rights Commission, the General Accounting Office, committees of both houses

of Congress, arid the Courts, hive all eoncurrcd in the judgement that the contract compliance agencies have not made full and effective use of the sanctions at
their disposal.
2.

This data was made available by the OFCCPs Division of Program Analysis. Of the

roughly 27000 centrally documented reviews, 19351 are identifiable. For the
period before consolidation of enforcenient activities into the OFCCP in 1978,
records are available primarily of reviews conducted by DOD. Fortunately DOD
accounted for rough]y half of all pre-conso]idation reviews. For eamp1e, in 1976
10,647 reviews were conducted, of which 5050 were performed by DOD, (IJSCCR,

1977, p.113), and of which about 4300 were centrally reported in detail.

Among the numerous contract compliance agencies prior to 1978, DOD enjoyed
one of the better reputations for strict enforcement, so by examining a sample of
primarily DOD reviews we start with one of the more rigorous enforcement efforts.

To the extent that defense contract.ors are heavily dependent on the federal
government, and more so than the reverse, we may be looking at a situation in
which the government stands in a relatively strong bargaining position.
3.

Multiple compliance reviews at the same establishment are not rare. Of the 19351

reviews at identifiable establishments', 13125 represented multiple reviews. OF
these, 10768 were conducted in consecutive years at 4479 establishments. These

pairs of reviews provide the data for this study. Some establishments experienced more than one set of consecutive reviews.

- t7While this research design allows the use of one consistent set of data, it depends

on repeatedly reviewed establishments which may differ from the average contractor establishment, or even from the average reviewed contractor. In particular, the large defense contractors who have been reviewed a number of times may

expect to be reviewed frequently, and so conform more carefully to regulations
and adhere more closely to promises. If so, this study may overstate the average
impact of affirmative action promises. This question could be answered empirically in future work by matching the compliance review records with data on con-

sequent realizations from EEO-l reports. While the use of a sample of multiply

reviewed defense contractors may overstate the impact of affirmative action, I
believe this is unlikely to significantly bias the results reported here.

The determinants of reviews are studied at length in a companion paper. Reviews

are primarily a function of size. The multiply reviewed establishments studied
here are significantly larger than other contractor establishments. They are also
more black, but otherwise do not differ greatly in their initial demographics.
4.

Since there are six demographic groups, there are only five independent share
equations to be estimated. The reported employment pattcrns are thought of as

a sample statistic for the establishment's true employment propensities, so the

regressions are weighted by initial year establishment size to correct for
heteroskedasticity.
5.

Each of these mileposts in the bargaining process reflect both the establishment's

resistance to bureaucratic pressure, and at the same time increasing levels of
bureaucratic pressure itself. If establishment resistance can be controlled for,
then these may be taken roughly as inputs into a regulatory production function.

This is the method adopted here to deal with the simultaneity problem. We
assume that corporate resistance is controlled for by the past growth rates of
protected group employment share, and by initial notification of deficiencies, so

- 18
we

-

can then ask what the marginal impact is of factors of regulatory production

such as conciliation agreemcnts arid show cause notices.
6.

Table 2 also indicates the importance of healthy macroeconomic growth in
accommodating minority and female ernploynient. We estimate separate intercepts for each year, with 1974 omitted. White males' employment share growth is
greater during the recession years of 1975 and 1930. Correspondingly, females'
and blacks' shares are substantially lower.

7.

Caution must be exercised in interpreting this result, since it may reflect the
weakness of the identifying assumption rather than thc weakness of enforcement
tools.

8.

Comparing results across demographic groups, tire value of the projections is
weaker and less significant for minority males. One might expect promises for
females to be less costly to fulfill because of the concurrent increase Lii female

labor supply, but it is not clear why employers should appear less prescient in
forecasting the share of minority males than that of other groups.
9. We know that minority and female emp]oymn.ent shares increase in growing estab-

lishments, so errors in projecting total growth will reduce the accuracy of share
projections. To insulate from this effect, the regressions in Table 5 were repeated

for the sub-sample of establishments that grew by at least 1 0 percent during the

projection year. To the extent that this truncates the bottom of the sample on
the basis of a variable that is correlated with the dependent, it should bias all
coefficients toward zero. The power and significance of the projections are much

greater once the possibly confounding errors in projecting total growth are
reduced in this fashion. There are two factors at work here. First, it is far easier

to increase minority arid female employment in establishments that grow.
Secondly, we expect establishments that are surprised by a recession to overstate
the workforce openings they will have for minorities and females. Establishments

- 19 -

that grow stick far more closely to their projections for minority and female

employmentshare than do stagnant or shrinking establishments.

11. The study of the inner workings of the affirmative action negotiation process
would amount to futility compounded if that process were shown t.o be without
substance and of theatrical value only. Tire next step is to explore in more (1el:ail
the nature of the ar rnative action bargaining process, particularly as part of the
federal contracting process.
