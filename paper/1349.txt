Macroeconomic Evidence on the Composition of Effective
Household Savings During the 1960s and l9IOs

ABSTRACT

This paper studies the impact of broad changes in the economic and
financial environment on the savings rate and portfolio composition of indi-

viduals in different age groups and household types. Employing survey data,
household savings are cumulated as increases in net transactable wealth

observed across three benchmark dates: January—February 1962, the first
half of 1970, and August—September, 1911. This paper describes how savings
rates and the allocation of accumulated savings across different financial

and real—estate assets varied with household circumstances. A sharp turnaround is observed between the 1960s and 1910s in the profiles of saving
and homeownership for younger and older households.

MICROECONOMIC EVIDENCE ON THE COMPOSITION
OF EFFECTIVE HOUSEHOLD SAVINGS DURING THE 1960s AND 1970s

Edward 3. Kane*

Employing survey data on consumer balance sheets, this chapter describes mean
differences in effective savings rates and in the allocation of accumulated savings

across financial and real-estate assets for households in different demographic
circumstances. Adopting a balance-sheet perspective, effective saving is defined
as the net increase between survey dates in the amount of wealth a household holds

in the particular assets and liabilities for which survey data are collected.
Effective saving is an ex post and data-determined concept.

It differs from

anticipated saving not only because of income and expenditure surprises, but also

by the amount of the unanticipated capital gain or loss that accrues on a
respondent's overall portfolio position. In that it includes the effect of revaluations of existing assets, it differs also from the concept of ex

saving that is

embodied in the national income and product accounts.'

Three surveys conducted by the Survey Research Center (SRC) of the
University of Michigan serve as our principal source of data. Because survey
instruments did not regularly include questions about the value of pension claims,
claims against insurance reserves, and tangible assets other than real estate, these

assets are neglected in our study. To assign a name to the wealth concept that
corresponds to the net-worth account of these truncated survey balance sheets, we

introduce the term "net transactable wealth."
In this paper, household savings are cumulated as increases in net transactable wealth observed across three benchmark dates: 3anuary-February 1962, the

2

first half of 1970, and August-September 1977. These time intervals are chosen
because in each of them the SRC conducted a comprehensive national survey of
household balance sheets. Because data were collected from over 2,000 households

in each instance, the samples are large enough to support some analysis of crossclassified data.

Our goal is to develop and to interpret data on cross-sectional differences in

wealth trajectories through time. Our unifying hypothesis is that changes in the

economic and financiaPenironment seldom lead individuals in different demographic circumstances to effeèt parallel adjustments either in their saving rate or

in the composition of their equilibrium portfolios. This hypothesis implies that
class-level differences in the rate of wealth accumulation reflect returns from
active portfolio management as well as the passive realignment of portfolio shares

occasioned by unpredictable fluctuations in the prices of individual assets. We
strive to show that, over 1962-1977, wealth redistribution had an active as well as
a passive dimension.

Our analysis can be likened to examining the slopes of line segments drawn

triangularly through three data points. For most partitions of survey respondents,

we concern ourselves mainly with differences in the orientations of the 1962-70
and 1970-77 legs of the triangle. However, for specified age cohorts, we look also
at data covering the longer 1962-1977 segment.

A PRELIMINARY LOOK AT THE DATA
Although the 1962 and 1970 Surveys of Consumer Finances record holdings to the
nearest dollar (i.e., asked respondents for point estimates), most of the balancesheet data collected in the 1977 Consumer Credit Survey sponsored by the Federal

Reserve Board are in interval form. To aggregate 1977 observations across asset

3
classes

to estimate an individual household's transactable wealth, it is first

necessary to convert the interval estimates into point estimates.

Detailed

aggregation procedures, which draw on mean values recorded for various assetholding intervals in the 1962 and 1970 surveys, are explained in Shumay and Kane
(1983).

Because the accuracy and representativeness of survey data are always in
doubt, a responsible researcher must endeavor as far as possible to collate survey
measurements with comparable figures from other data sets. Reported percentage

allocations of consolidated transactable wealth to financial assets and real-estate
equity differ greatly between SRC surveys of households and institutionally derived

Federal Reserve Flow of Funds (FOF) data. Averaged across survey years, SRC
portfolio weights for financial assets are roughly 3/8. This is just over one-half of

their average weight in FOF data. For real-estate equity, the situation is reversed:
SRC weights range between 60 and 65 percent, while FOF weights vary between 25
and 35 percent. These discrepancies have many sources. First, in sample
surveys,

respondents have both a tendency to forget and an understandable reluctance to
disclose sensitive economic information. This leads respondents to misreport (and

on average to underreport) their positions in various financial assets (Ferber,
Forsythe, Guthrie, and Maynes 1969a and 1969b; Goldsmith 1982). Shumay and
Kane (1983) describe the error-detection and error-correction procedures to which
the 1962, the 1970, and particularly the 1977 data sets were subjected. Answers to

straightforward questions of fact such as whether a household is a homeowner or

has mortgage debt should be more reliable than value estimates. In an interview

situation, a household that owns a wide variety of stocks and bonds may easily
overlook its position in particular securities. Second, valuation skills may differ

across respondents, especially for real-estate assets. Third, valuation principles,

4

intrayear timing, and reporting categories differ between the SRC and Flow of

Funds accounts. In the Flow of Funds accounts, the household sector includes
personal trusts and nonprofit organizations, and a category of miscellaneous assets

exists. A fourth complication is that the interviewing unit in SRC surveys shifted
after 1964 from the "spending unit" to the "family unit."

In view of these discrepancies, the purpose of this paper is not to produce
unbiased estimates of consolidated balance sheets for the household sector as a
whole. Rather, it is to examine differences in saving and portfolio behavior across

households nartitioned by ae and family
-- comoosition. To assess the reoresenta—

tiveness

of SRC samples and of our aggregation procedures vis-a-vis patterns of

incremental wealth accumulation, Table 9-1 compares cumulative movements

for the pooled cross-section sample between survey dates with time-series

changes reported in FOF data covering approximately the same intervals. SRC and

FOF estimates of cumulative growth rates for deposits and savings bonds and for
owner-occupied real estate are similar in both periods, but especially for 1962-1970

other categories diverge considerably. In part this is because, in an effort to
compensate for the greater nonreporting of financial information by high-income
households, SRC surveys oversample high-income households (Katona, Mandell, and

Schmiedescamp, 197 1:3-4; Durkin and Elliehausen, 1978: 97-99). Measured against

Census data, the concentration on hii nrome households increased from the 1970

to 1977 survey. In Table 9-1, the divergences are greatest for assets favored by
wealthy households:

for corporate equities, for marketable bonds (where, by

recording increases in par values without respect to ongoing price depreciation,
SRC surveys seriously overstate value growth in an era of rising interest rates), and

5

for the category of investment real estate (which has no strict counterpart in the
Flow of Funds accounts). In addition, these same assets bulk large in the portfolios

of personal trusts and nonprofit organizations. Goldsmith reports that nonprofit
organizations greatly reduced the weight of bonds and stocks in their portfolios
between 1964 and 1975. Except for corporate equities, the alternative estimates

of cumulative growth in net transactable wealth prove doser f or the 1970-77
period (which makes use of the same concept of interviewing unit at both end
dates) than for 1962-70.

For equity in homes, it proved impossible to maintain complete comparability

between 1977 and earlier survey data. First, fully 6.6 percent of 1977 respondent
households reported themselves as homeowners without revealing either the value

of their home or information about the terms of their mortgage. Second, unlike
the 1962 and 1970 survey instruments, the 1977 questionnaire did not ask for the

value of outstanding mortgage debt. Fortunately, in all but 57 cases (2.2 percent
of sample respondents and 5.2 percent of the 1,099 mortgagors in the sample), it

proved possible to estimate the book value of mortgage debt from information
concerning the terms of the mortgage. In the sample analyzed in this study, the

homeownership rate falls short of the 64.8 percent Census estimate for 1977
reported by Carliner (1982), even though the unedited survey sample showed a

homeownership rate of 68.9 percent. Moreover, the deletion bias does not fall
uniformly across various demographic partitions. In particular, because families
that have undergone some form of breakup or have occupied a home for a long time

are more likely to fail to report the value of their home as well as to forget
relevant information or to report inconsistent mortgage terms, the cases deleted
include a disproportionately large number of older mortgagors. The edited sample's
lack of representativeness can be assessed from Table 9-2, which compares

6

Place Table 9-2 near here
homeownership rates in our 1977 sample with two-age dass partitions published in

Carliner (1982). Data presented in Table 9-9 show that the percentage of deleted
homeowners increases steadily with the age of a household's head.

FACTORS DIFFERENTIALLY AFFECTING HOUSEHOLD SAVINGS

PATTERNS IN THE 1960s AND 1970s

Modern theories of consumption emphasize that, for a representative household,
savings behavior differs as it moves through the life cycle. Life-cycle theories of
saving (Modigliani and Brumberg 1954; Ando and Modigliani 1963) hold that, over

its lifetime, a household accumulates and decumulates wealth to smooth the
timestream of its consumption expenditures by offsetting the effects of anticipated and unanticipated variation in income receipts and in spending goals. Spending

goals indude predictable and partly controllable bulges in expenditure, such as
those occasioned by retirement, college expenses, vacations, and downpayments on

big-ticket items such as cars and houses. They also indude provisions for bequests

and unpredictable (and often uncontrollable) bulges in expenditure such as for
household repairs and health emergencies. If it could ignore complications due to
uncertainty about the age of death, this theory would predict that, as a household
approached the end of its expected life span, it would plan to decumulate wealth to
the level of intended bequests.

Because differences in implicit and explicit transactions charges and in

securities' minimum denominations affect the liquidity of various assets, the
existence of a life cycle in saving patterns suggests the likelihood of a correspond-

ing life cycle in patterns of asset holding. In this second life cycle, we may expect

differences in age-class transactions costs, tax structure, and portfolio risks to
play an important role. 1-listorically, securities dealers and brokers have priced

7

their services in ways that discourage small individual trades: imposing odd-lot
fees, transactions minima, and per-trade charges. Calculated as a percentage of

the value of a trade, explicit transactions charges fall as the dollar amount
increases.

Although we may presume that this schedule of charges mirrors

underlying broker costs, it predisposes financial investments by low-wealth house-

holds toward small-denomination retail assets such as deposits and U.S. savings

bonds. At the same time, households must worry about the exposure of their
accumulated wealth to implicit and explicit taxation and to various kinds of risk.
Differential changes between survey dates in age-class transactions costs, tax
structure, and portfolio risk-return loci should lead to a change in the equilibrium

composition of age-class portfolios.

For convenience, we may call this the

portfolio-churning hypotheses.

Of course, the distribution of wealth across age dasses may change without

active churning of household balance sheets. Passive churning occurs when the
prices of assets held to a disproportionate extent by particular age classes appreci-

ate or depreciate faster than the prices of other assets. Over any interest-rate
cycle, passive churning occurs because the assets favored by low-wealth households

(checking accounts and passbook savings accounts) are fixed in value, while the

value of highly wealth-elastic assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate
fluctuate with market forces. As Table 9-3 shows, between the 1962 and 1970
Place Table 9-3 about here

survey dates, savings accounts and U.S. Treasury bills both returned about 12.5
percent after inflation while common stock and single-family homes both appreci-

ated 28 percent. However, in the 1970-1977 period, while liquid investments in
Treasury bills held their real value only slightly better than savings accounts did,
stocks and bonds appreciated at greatly divergent rates. As stock prices rose less

8

than 8 percent, the value of single-family homes increased 85.4 percent. Even
ignoring the implicit or shelter services a house provides, over 1970-77 housing
investments far outperformed financial assets.

Real-estate and stock prices move in response to private economic forces
such as exogenous movements in construction costs, to demographic pressures, and

to government taxes and subsidies. In particular, much of the active and passive

churning observed in the 1960s and 1970s was driven by the interaction of
unanticipatedly accelerating inflation with the inherited structure of deposit-rate
ceilings, deposit insurance, federal income taxes, and housing subsidies. House-

holds also responded to changes in taxes and regulations that, after a lag,
authorities made to adapt taxes and regulatory policies to ongoing inflation.

For households, the federal income tax is nonneutral with respect to inflation

in two principal ways. First, capital-gains taxes (though set typically at only a
fraction of tax rates on ordinary income) are levied even when purely nominal price

increases are realized in the sale of physical assets. Second, federal taxes are
levied progressively on nominal incomes. For both reasons, inflation tends over
time to push given levels of real personal income into potentially higher and higher

tax brackets. Bracket drift simultaneously puts pressure on Congress to lower

statutory tax rates and raises the incentive for households to engage in taxavoidance activity. Estimates of average marginal tax rates on personal income

show a small upward drift between survey dates (Barro and Sahasakul 1983).

Moreover, the changing structure of tax rates, particularly on explicit capital
income as documented by Estrella and Fuhrer (1983), ought to have affected
various types of households differently.

During 1970-77, effective tax rates on capital gains were increased in several

ways. First, over 1970-1972, the maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains was

9

increased in three steps to 35 percent. However, until 1978, the tax rate on the
first $50,000 of an individual's capital gains was capped at 25 percent. Second, the

holding period necessary to qualify a capital asset for preferential long-term
capital-gains treatment was raised from six months to nine months in 1977 and to
one year in 1978. Third, beginning in 1970, net long-term capital losses of $1000 or

less could no longer be deducted in full against ordinary income. Henceforth, only
50 percent of these losses could be deducted, again up to a maximum deduction of
$1000 (now $3000) in any tax year.

It is widely believed that, because service returns and capital gains from

investments in owner-occupied housing continued to be treated preferentially
throughout the 1970s, unanticipated increases in inflation and inflation risk tended

to raise the price of owner-occupied homes relative to stock prices (DeLeeuw and

Ozanne 1979; Summers 1981; Hendershott and Hu 1983).2

Tax preferences

accorded owner-occupied housing include nontaxation of the value of the services
provided by an owner-occupied home, the capacity for repeated deferrals of capital
gains due on changes in residence, and a once-in-a-lifetime forgiveness of some of

the capital-gains taxes that would otherwise be due on the sale of a principal
residence once the seller has attained a designated age. Before July 26, 1978,
gains on the sale of a principal residence with an adjusted sales price of $35,000 or

less were not taxable for sellers who were 65 or older and who had occupied the

residence for five of the eight years preceding the sale. In cases where the
adjusted sales price exceeded $35,000, sellers who met the age and occupancy tests

could still exclude a portion of the gain from taxation. In 1978, the critical age
was lowered to 55, the occupancy rule shortened to three of five years, and the
excludable amount raised to $100,000. (While not strictly indexed with inflation,

10

the maximum exclusion has since been raised to $125,000.) Although the alteration

in the capital-gains tax forgiveness on sales of homes occurred after the 1977

survey date, it would not have found a place on the legislative agenda unless
households who were in or approaching the 55-64 age range were fighting for it
politically during the preceding years. The cost of mobilizing political resources to

extract a new tax advantage suggests that, during the 1970s, many so-called
"empty nest" households must have been contemplating the sale of what had
become in terms of its size or implied burden of school taxes an inappropriate
house.

It should be clear that the value of the in-kind services a house performs for
its occupants varies with the composition of the household residing in it. Because

these services are not taxed for owner-occupants, changes in the structure of

explicit taxes differentially affect implicit rates of return on rental and owneroccupied types of housing.

Leveraged investments in housing financed with regulatorily subsidized fixed-

rate mortgages benefited additionally from unanticipated inflation. Unanticipated
inflation lowers the real burden of fixed-rate mortgage debt (see Hendershott and

Hu 1981). With returns on financial instruments distorted by deposit-rate ceilings
and multiple regulatory subsidization of homeownership and home financing (see

Kane 1981), no other easily available financial transaction offered established or
growing households of low or average wealth as high an anticipated real after-tax
rate of return or as favorable a hedge against unanticipated inflation.

Extended to savings-and-loan associations in 1966, ceilings on nominal
interest rates payable on deposits discriminated against low-wealth households.
Regulators selectively relaxed these ceilings in the 1970s by tying differences in

ceiling rates on certificate accounts to differences in maturity and minimum
denominations. This helped deposit institutions to discriminate more effectively

between interest-sensitive and interest-insensitive low-wealth customers. As

11

Table 9-3 shows, this discrimination pushed inflation-adjusted explicit returns in
the 1970s on savings accounts below those on Treasury bills and left them sharply
negative for passbook savings.

Opportunities to counterbalance the negative real after-tax rates of explicit
returns on deposit assets differed with the level of household wealth. For wealthy
households, they differed also between the 1960s and 1970s. In either era, wealthy

households could better extract a compensating stream of implicit returns from

deposit institutions and move wealth more efficiently into stocks and bonds.
Transactions costs and the risks of being underdiversified made these avenues less

feasible for low-wealth households. Similarly, when money-market mutual funds
(whose rate of growth first surged in 1974) and the variety of high-rate certificate-

of-deposit (CD) accounts expanded in the 1970s, financial-market opportunities
improved f or households of moderate and high wealth. But these changes did little

for low-wealth investors. Hence, while wealthy households could reallocate their

portfolios to escape most of the ex ante burden that anticipated inflation and
deposit-rate regulation would otherwise place on them, throughout the period of
observation, poor households were more tightly constrained. Two principal avenues

of adjustment were open to low-wealth households: (1) to make highly leveraged
investments in housing and durable goods, and (2) to cut back their overall rate of
saving.

This study focuses on transactable and noncontractual savings, forms of
household wealth that are not administered by outside parties such as insurance

companies, pension funds, and the Social Security System. However, we must
recognize that wealth accumulated in contractual arrangements should, as explained in Munnell (1981), condition a household's decisions about how to accumulate and

to manage transactable wealth. Whatever life cycle in portfolio structure we
observe must be interpreted in the light of the lifetime pattern of simultaneous and

12

partly exogenous growth in the risk-adjusted present value of households' pensionfund and social-security claims.3 In 1972, the decision to increase real socialsecurity benefits and to double-index them to an upwardly biased consumer price
index may be interpreted as a governmental redistribution of wealth from younger
to older households.

This redistribution, which also reduced older households'

exposure to inflation risk, might have altered each group's need for transactable
saving.

SAVINGS BEHAVIOR

r

We hypothesize that a household's effective saving rate over any period
varies with its place in the life cycle, its size, and the marital status of its head.
We further hypothesize that, as the economic and financial environment changes,
class-level saving rates and portfolio structures vary actively as well as passively.

Passively, any dass of households tends to gain or lose wealth relative to other
classes whenever assets in which that class historically maintains a disproportion-

ately large position experience an unanticipated increase or decrease in value.

This hypothesis implies that on average windfall gains and losses on particular

assets impact saving as well as consumption. Asset revaluation is only partly
offset by readjustments in the level and composition of new savings (Jianakop1os
1983).

Actively, households in any dass adapt their portfolios to differential

movements in the net after-tax risk-adjusted real returns anticipated on different
assets. Because anticipated returns were not observed for survey respondents, the
institutional facts developed in the previous section are used along with the ex

returns listed in Table 9-3 as proxies for the set of information on which a rational

respondent would have conditioned his or her rate-of-return forecasts. Particular

13

stress is placed on the roles played by three factors: differential changes in
implicit returns on owner-occupied housing, the 1965 expansion of deposit-rate
regulation and its subsequent decline in effectiveness, and the level of a household's wealth as a restraint on incentives to engage in disintermediation.

To examine what we may call the life-cycle, family-size, and marital-status
hypotheses, we develop a series of statistical tables. The first two tables present

evidence on differences in propensities to save and in patterns of real wealth
accumulation. These tables are reported for every partition we examine. Other
tables track differences in class-level positions in particular assets. These tables

throw light on the extent to which active and passive portfolio churning may be
observed at the dass-level.

Although portfolio churning is examined in detail only for age classes, we
compare summary distributions for all sample partitions of class-level positions in

selected financial and real-estate assets with the percent of sample families in
each class. These tables amount to a series of Lorenz curves for assets.
For age classes and age cohorts, various additional tables are developed. Two

of these disaggregate percentage and dollar changes in class-level wealth across

specific financial and real-estate opportunities. These tables support inferences

about the allocation of new saving. A third table reports mean wealth and
homeownership and mortgagor rates for each class. Finally, for age classes only,

wealth-based Engels curves are estimated for four types of financial and realestate investments.

Differences in Engels-curve coefficients are tested both

across survey dates and across age classes at each date. This analysis provides
additional evidence on the extent of active and passive portfolio churhing.

OBSERVED SI-LIFTS IN LIFE-CYCLE SAVINGS PATTERNS

Tables 9-4 through 9-9 compare househo'ds at identical stages of the life cycle
across time. Table 9-4 focuses on mean savings in dollars and on ratios of real

14

(i.e., inflation-adjusted) saving to real income. The ratios reported in the table
tend to overstate the magnitude of age-class average propensities to save because
incomes reported by survey respondents tend to be understated. Survey responses

are subject to deliberate underreporting and omit imputed income such as
unrealized capital gains, the services of owner-occupied housing, and implicit
interest received as subsidized accountholder services from deposit institutions.

This error in measurement tends to raise reported saving-to-income ratios for

all groups.

If we ignore possible differences in measurement errors across

demographic classes, Table 9-4 indicates that, during the 1960s, households whose
Place Table 9-4 near here

heads were at least 55 years old saved a much larger percentage of their real
incomes than younger persons did.

Moreover, unless it reflects age-related

reporting bias in 1977 home equity or unanticipated passive appreciation of existing

portfolio holdings, the high rate of accumulation observed in the 1960s f or
households in the 65-and-over category is hard to reconcile with the life-cycle
theory.

But increased life-cycle decumulation by older households and the

hypothesized redistributive impact of social-security indexing is consistent with
the turnaround between the 1960s and the 1970s in effective patterns of life-cycle

saving reported in the table. This pattern pivots like a mirror image around the

breakpoint observed at age 55.

Below this age, households increased their

effective saving rates substantially during the 1970s. However, over the same
period, older households greatly reduced their effective saving rates. Comparing

1972-73 with 1962 behavior in an income-expenditure data set, Lieberman and

Wachtel (1980) report a similarly sharp dedine in the savings rate of older
households that predates the 1974 adjustment in social-security benefits.

Table 9-5 reports cumulative growth rates for mean nominal wealth and mean
Place Table 9-5 near here

15

real wealth. As explained in the note to the table, the cumulative rate of increase

in real wealth is calculated from the ratio of mean end-date wealth to inflation-

adjusted base-date wealth. The table provides further evidence that age-group
wealth trajectories differed sharply between the two periods. During the l960s,
wealth accumulation by households whose heads were 55 and older greatly outpaced

the savings growth achieved by younger households. In the 1970-77 period, the
reverse proves true. Although two-thirds of the population of sample households
were on balance net savers during the 1970s, these households were the youngest

ones. Because the proportion of transactable wealth controlled by households in
the designated age dasses rises on average with the age of the household head, the
pooled growth rate in real saving fell by almost two-thirds.

Table 9-6 shows mean dollar increments experienced in three broad compo-

nents of net transactable wealth: retail financial assets (deposits and savings
bonds), wholesale financial assets (stocks and bonds), and equity in real estate (i.e.,

value of real-estate assets less mortgage debt). To allow readers to unravel the
Place Table 9-6 near here

effect of mortgage leverage, an additional column describes the cumulative
increase in the market value of real-estate assets. The table indicates that, for
households above and below age 55, differential rates of wealth accumulation
spread across portfolio categories during the 1970s, but (in keeping with the wealth

constraint on opportunities for disintermediation) differences observed during the

1960s were dominated by differences in the flow of new savings into wholesale
financial assets.

Table 9-7 illustrates the proportionate weight carried by real-estate investPlace Table 9-7 near here

ment as a vehicle of household wealth accumulation. Real-estate equity is defined

as the difference between the market value of real-estate owned and the book

16

value of mortgage debt secured by these holdings.4 This variable is dominated by
equity in homes. For survey respondents in the 1960s and 1970s, real-estate equity
carried roughly 60 percent of the overall increase in mean household wealth.

For each survey date, Table 9-8 shows the distribution across age classes of

retail financial assets (deposits and savings bonds), wholesale financial assets
(stocks and marketable bonds), real-estate equity, net transactable wealth, and the

value of owner-occupied housing. This table presents something like a Lorenz
curve
Place Table 9-8 near here

for age classes. It lets us see that the age structure of the population interacts
with life-cyde patterns of asset accumulation to determine the share of national

wealth controlled by a given age group.

To assess the degree of wealth

redistribution occurring across age classes between survey dates, it is useful to

focus on changes in what we may call the control ratio: the percentage of net
transactable wealth held per each one percent of respondents in a given age class.

For this purpose, it is convenient to consolidate households into three age dasses:

under 35, 35 to 54, and 55 and older. In 1962, older households held the greatest

percentage control of transactable wealth. Their control ratio stood at 1.44, as
against 1.14 for rniddle-.aged households and 0.34 for young ones. Between 1962
and 1970, and in keeping with the savings rates shown in Tables 9-4 and 9-5, older

households improved their control ratio even further, to 1.73 as against declines to

0.95 and 0.23 for middle-aged and young households, respectively. However, the
high saving rates maintained by young and middle-aged households during the 1970s

improved their 1977 ratios. In 1977, the control ratios were 0.42, 1.28, and 1.26,
respectively.

If these changes were due only to passive portfolio churning,

percentage control of component assets would not change at all. Contrary to the

17

temporal variation shown in the data underlying Table 9-8, control ratios for
individual asset categories (e.g., for the value of homes) would have to remain
constant over time.
Table 9-9 shows that at each survey date mean wealth, homeownership rates,
and use of mortgage leveraging differed across age groups. For the first of these
Place Table 9-9 near here

variables, the table also reports the standard error of the mean. Even allowing for

age-level differences in leverage, variation in the percentage of wealth allocated

to leveraged investments in housing across age-group portfolios made passive
opportunities to benefit from unanticipated inflation in 1962 lowest for very young

households and highest for middle-aged ones. This table provides evidence that

unanticipated returns on accumulated wealth cannot account fully for the turnaround in the age profile of effective savings performance during the 1970s. New

saving by young households is suggested by their establishing a steadily higher
percentage of homeownership. Even allowing for the bias in our estimates of age-

class homeownership rates, the table suggests that during the 1970s, some emptynest housing was bid away from households in the 55-and.-over group.5 Given young

families' typically high use of leverage in their housing investments, their expanded

homeownership rates repositioned them to realize portfolio gains from anticipated
and unanticipated inflation.

TESTING FOR SHIFTS IN WEALTH-HOLDING PATTERNS

These data show that wealth-holding patterns differ both across age groups and
across time. This section fits these patterns into a framework of optimal choice.

Modern portfolio theory portrays balance-sheet choices as allocating wealth
in response to variation in the mean vector and covariance matrix of asset returns

18

(Friedman 1982).

In this application, these choices should be conditioned by

unobserved differences in the composition of an individual's holdings of nonmarket-

able assets such as pension claims and human capital (Mayers 1973). Taxes and

transactions costs may (at least as an interpretive first approximation) both be
presumed to vary with portfolio size. However, the means and covariances of asset

returns (although not necessarily the marginal risks) should be the same for all

households at each date. Hçnce, a particularly straightforward way to explain
differences in asset-holding patterns is to estimate for every age group at each

survey date a set of wealth-based Engels curves for the main components of
transactable wealth. We interpret each curve as showing how the increment in
wealth that a household desires to place in a particular portfolio component varies
with the level of household wealth.
Using a quadratic approximation, Tables 9-10, 9-11, 9-12, and 9-13 report

Place Tables 9-10 through 9-13 near here

estimates of wealth-based Engels curves for retail financial assets, wholesale

financial assets, home equity, and equity in investment real estate.

Because

reported portfolio positions in these assets never fall below zero, a Tobit limited-

dependent-variable estimation procedure is employed.

Respecting individual

balance-sheet constraints, when the censored-regression equations for any age
dass are summed across the four portfolio opportunities, the wealth coefficients
must sum to one, while the intercepts and wealth-squared terms must each sum to

zero. Except for the 65-and-over group in 1977, mean wealth rises with age. The
column labeled "wealth-squared coefficient times twice mean wealth" tells us how

much the first derivative of the mean portfolio position with respect to wealth

departs from the regression coefficient for wealth. The sum of this adjusted
coefficient and the regression coefficient for wealth represents the marginal

19

proportion of mean wealth that allocated to the asset class in question. Although
deviations between the marginal proportion and the wealth coefficient range up to
0.125 in magnitude, the median adjustment is less than 0.05.

The tables show that, across age groups and dates, portfolio positions in all

four portfolio categories generally increase with household wealth. The major
differences concern life-cycle differences in allocation patterns and the sensitivity

of incremental allocation rates to the level of wealth. For most age groups, what
we may call the marginal propensity to hold retail financial assets and real-estate
equity decreases with wealth. On the other hand, the marginal propensity to hold
wholesale financial assets increases with wealth.

Estimated differences in the wealth sensitivity of the various marginal
propensities accord broadly with conventional wisdom about the role of trans-

actions costs, minimum denominations, and difficulties in arranging credit as
barriers to investment by low-wealth households in wholesale financial assets and
investment real estate (Kane 1980). As compared to low-wealth households, high-

wealth households should hold retail financial assets more for liquidity and
diversification purposes than as vehicles for maximal accumulation of expected
future wealth.

For retail financial assets, wholesale financial assets, and (to reduce the
number of computer runs) the sum of the two kinds of equity in real-estate, formal

tests were conducted of differences in coefficient estimates across age classes and
across survey dates. These tests apply one-zero dummy variables for specific dates

and age classes to all three parameters in the model. Because observations on the

regressand are truncated in Tobit estimation, the distribution of the "t-statistics"

developed may not be well-approximated by Student's t when the number of
nonlimit observations is small.

20

Differences in Engels coefficients across time may be attributed to differences in the mean vector and covariance matrix of anticipated risk-adjusted after-

tax returns on the component assets at different dates, to differences in the range

of wealth observed, and to sampling error as well. Differences in coefficients
across age groups reflect differences in life—cycle status, effective transactions
costs, and range of wealth observed, as well as sampling error once again.

Coefficient Differences Across Age Groups

On a cross-section basis, we are interested at each survey date in the significance

of differences in coefficieht estimates across age classes, If significant differences did not exist, studying age-dass Engels curves for assets would have no
statistical justification.

Although to save space the detailed results are not reported here, we used

slope and intercept dummy variables to test the significance of differences
between coefficient estimates for every age-class pair. For all equations, in both

1962 and 1977, significant differences prove to be the rule rather than the
exception. On average in these years, two-thirds of the slope coefficients and 40
percent of the intercepts differ significantly from the corresponding estimates for

other classes.

In 1970, only about one—fifth of the coefficient pairs differ

significantly, with significant differences particularly rare in the equation for real—

estate equity. We interpret the similarity of coefficient pairs in 1970 as evidence
that wealth-related constraints on a household's ability to engage in disintermedia-

tion temporarily became a more important force in portfolio allocation than hf ecycle considerations.

21

Coefficient Differences Over Time
Tables 9-10, 9-11, and 9-14 indicate that, for retail financial assets, wholesale

Place Table 9-14 near here

financial assets and real-estate equity, more than half of the estimated slope
coefficients differ significantly across survey dates. The significance of coeff icient differences is somewhat more frequent for the (quaçlratic than for the linear
term. This is important because an individual's marginal allocation to a given asset

deviates from the wealth coefficient by the product of the coefficient for the
quadratic term and twice the individual's level of wealth.

The pattern of differences observed is consistent with the hypothesis that the

benefits of financial disintermediation increase with household wealth. Although
importantly constrained by the evolving structure of taxes and transactions costs,
households actively reallocated their portfolios to protect themselves against the

interaction of ceilings on explicit nominal rates of interest on deposit assets with
rising market rates of interest.
Between 1962 and 1970, older households increased their propensity to hold

wholesale assets and decreased their propensity to hold retail assets and home
equity.

Although households in the under-45 group increased their marginal

propensity to hold retail assets, this propensity to hold financial assets of either

kind became more sensitive to increases with wealth. Older and wealthier
households showed a reduced disposition to hold retail financial assets and a higher

propensity to invest in more-volatile wholesale securities. The resulting increase

in the demand for brokerage services drove up transactions costs in wholesale

markets, especially for small trades (Kane 1980).

These transactions-cost

increases reinforced the attractiveness to very-young families of leveraged investments in homes, bringing about a reverse shift in wealth propensities for younger
households.

22

Schemes for paying implicit interest on household deposits (e.g., "free"
checking) proliferated in the 1970s and the regulatory strategy shifted to one of
letting the ceiling rate on a deposit account more closely approach its market level

the larger the account's minimum denomination and the longer its stated maturity.

In addition, as shown in Table 9-3, 1970-77 holding-period returns on stocks and
Treasury bills proved negative in real terms. For at least some of these reasons, as

our data show, between 1970 and 1977 retail assets regained their former
attractiveness to older households, while wholesale assets lost some of their luster.

Young and middle-aged families generally increased their propensity to allocate
wealth to real estate, while this propensity declined significantly for (nonmarried)
households in the 65-and-over group.

ACCUMULATIONS BY AGE COHORTS

Another way to look at patterns of life-cyde saving is to study how the mean net

worth of a particular age cohort behaves as members of the cohort grow older.
Here, the focus falls on transitions through a prolonged preretirement phase of
average wealth accumulation into a hypothesized phase of planned wealth decumulation.

Table 9-15 pushes forward the age cohorts reported in Table 9-4 and 9-5 for
Place Table 9-15 near here

the 1962 and 1970 surveys to develop comparable data for appropriately older

respondents in the 1970 and 1977 surveys. The table deletes the wealth of
household heads that were under 18 in 1962 and 1970 and therefore too young to be

sampled. Following age classes through time provides something akin to a panel
perspective on patterns of life-cycle saving. We see that, in all cohorts, households

managed to increase their mean real net worth from 1962 to 1970. However, the

23

second panel shows that, during the 1970s, the per-year rate of real accumulation

increased dramatically for the youngest 1962 cohort, decreased for the fourth
cohort (some of whom were passing into the retirement stage), and turned negative

for the two oldest cohorts.

The third panel, which compares post-sample

accumulation rates for 1962 and 1970 cohorts, shows a similar picture.

Economic theory treats changes in saving rates as adaptive responses to
changing requirements for consumption smoothing. In the 1970s, the two oldest

cohorts experienced consumption-expanding windfall gains in wealth from two
sources; the double-indexing of social-security benefits and unanticipated appreci-

ation in real housing prices. For these cohorts, the desirability of decumulating
transactable wealth may have been further enhanced by the structure of capital-

gains taxes and dedines in reported mean real incomes of 20 and 30 percent,
respectively. If the two youngest cohorts' sharply higher savings rates represents
consumption smoothing too, it may be due mainly to unanticipated increases in the

capitalized real value of fulfilling their lifetime housing needs. We show in the

next section that families with three or more children (for whom the average
implicit return on housing space is greatest) greatly increased their mean saving

rate in the 1970s, while smaller families drastically reduced theirs. Given the
secularly rising divorce rate, in the 1970s some small-sized families may have been

adapting to a reduction in family size.

To carry out plans to increase their mean rate of homeownership in the
1970s, many young households may have postponed the consumption of other goods

and services. Although SRC data do not bear on this issue, young households may
also have perceived secular growth in the size of government transfer programs as

increasing the discounted real value of their lifetime tax bills.

Tables 9-16 and 9-17 provide evidence on the composition of age-cohort
savings across different survey dates. Mean dollar increments in the values of

24

real-estate assets and of three components of net transactable wealth are shown in

Table 9-16. Data on real-estate assets are included to permit the interested reader

to decompose increases in real-estate equity into price-appreciation, portfoliorebalancing, and debt-expansion elements. Although component-by-component

Place Table 9-16 near here

growth rates vary widely across age classes and asset categories (from -61.2
percent to 5181.5 percent), Table 9-17 darifies that for every age class whose
Place Table 9-17 near here

mean nominal wealth increased (i.e., all but the 72-and-older group in 1970-77),

real-estate equity served in both periods as the major vehide for carrying
increased wealth across time.
Lorenz distributions for age cohorts are displayed in Table 9-18. For each
Place Table 9-18 near here

asset category, percentage control ratios are reported in parentheses. These
control percentages show the relative position that a representative household

takes in each type of wealth as it ages. For most assets and dates, the control
percentage follows a humped or inverted-U curve. The typical curve reaches its
maximum in middle age. Compared to financial assets, real-estate equity shows
higher values for young cohorts and generally peaks at an earlier age. The control

percentage for wholesale financial assets rises relative to retail assets as households move through their 30s and 40s. Households in their 50s and early 60s hold

the maximal percentage of wholesale assets, but this percentage falls off rapidly

when they reach retirement age.

Although for comparable age dasses the

percentage level of control varies across survey dates (presumably with differences

in the economic environment), the qualitative association with the life cycle does
not.

Table 9-19 focuses on changes in the homeownership rate and use of

25

Place Table 9-19 near here

mortgage debt across time. Allowing for the extent to which the understatement

of 1977 homeownership rates rises with age, the table provides time-series
confirmation of cross-section evidence on life-cycle patterns of homeownership
and mortgage repayment. Both within and across survey dates, homeownership

rates are seen to rise into late middle age and to fall off thereafter, while the use
of mortgage debt dedines steadily as a household ages.

DIFFERENCES IN ACCUMULATION RATES FOR
HOUSEHOLDS OF DIFFERENT SIZES

For many households, family size rises and falls over the life cyde in a humped
pattern that parallels the rise and fall of age-class homeownership rates. This
cyde in the size of the typical nuclear family reflects corresponding cycles in the

market value of its human capital, in marginal in-kind rates of return on given

amounts of housing space and school taxes, and in the household's detailed
expenditure goals.

One-person households consist of bachelors, divorced and separated individuals, and widowed persons. The age distribution of this group may have distinct

modes for each component dass. The above-average age and high standard
deviation shown for one-person households in Table 9-20 supports this presumption

of rnultimodality.
Place Table 9-20 near here

Two-person households consist of childless couples, older "empty-nest" cou-

ples, widowed, divorced, and even single parties with one child, and various
combinations of unmarried adults. The high (though falling) average age reported
for heads of two-person households in Table 9-20 is consistent with the hypothesis
that the mean number of children in these households is small.

26

Tables 9-21 and 9-22' show a sharp change in effective savings propensities
Place Tables 9-21 and 9-22 near here

between the 1960s and the 1970s paralleling the age-class reversals reported
earlier. Households of three or more persons were much more effective savers in

the 1970-77 period than in the 1962-70 era.

Correspondingly, while smaller

households grew wealthier during the 1960s, on average they drew down their real
wealth during the 1970s.
These patterns may be explained as adaptations to changes observed between

survey dates in tax structure, financial transactions costs, and risk-return oppor-

relatively constant real in-kind return on housing space for large households made

it optimal for them to expand their housing investments more than a smaller
household would. Interacting with the life cycle, the proportion of households
owning their home rises sharply with household size, as does the use of mortgage

leverage. For households with three or more persons, ownership and mortgagor
rates are twice as high as for smaller households. Table 9-23 shows that positions
Place Table 9-23 near here

in real-estate equity and owner-occupied housing also increase with household size.

Although two-person households have higher per-capita wealth than the other
categories at all three survey dates, during the 1970s larger households narrowed

the gap considerably. In contrast, the relative positions of one-person households
change little across dates. Differential savings performance across size classes in

the two eras does not merely reflect the passive interaction of increasing realestate prices with the positive association between prior real-estate holdings and
household size.

During the 1970s, large families increased their holdings of

27

financial assets even more rapidly than their real-estate equity. This increased
financial saving may have two sources.

First, it may reflect the efforts of

households still occupying rental housing to accumulate a sufficient downpayment

to support a planned house purchase. Second, it may reflect the use of mortgage
credit (which to most households represents the low-cost form of credit available)
to support financial investments.

DIFFERENCES IN ACCUMULATION RATES FOR
DIFFERENT TYPES OF HOUSEHOLDS

Table 9-24 explores the relationship between household size and marital status.
Place Table 9-24 near here

During the 1960s, all types of large households were less-effective savers than

smaller ones. Moreover, the 1970-77 increase in savings propensities for large
households was limited to married and other nonsingle .(i.e., widowed, separated,
and divorced) households.

This provides further support for the view that

movements in the expected value and variance of implicit returns on owner-

occupied housing explain a good part of the divergent movements in saving
propensities during the 1970s. These families' future housing requirements may be

presumed to be more stable than those for single households. During the 1970s,
large single households dissaved at a high rate.

Table 9-25 shows the effect of changing savings propensities on the real rate
Place Table 9-25 near here

of accumulation of transactable wealth. In the 1970-77 period, except for large
households in the married and other categories, no household type much improved

the real value of its mean transactable wealth. Table 9-26 shows that, in 1977, the
Place Table 9-26 near here

mean age of the heads of accumulating large households in the married and other

categories was in the 40s.

The mean ages of the heads of the four low-

28

accumulation types of households all prove significantly older or younger than this.

Particularly remarkable is the downward trend in the age of heads of single
families with two or more members. This reflects growth in the number of couples

living together without benefit of marriage. For these households, unsettled
property rights and uncertainty about the coupl&s commitment to a shared future
may erect substantial disincentives to homeownership and saving.

Data on portfolio shares (not reported here) show that the turnaround
between 1962-70 and 1970-77 in savings performance by large nonsingle families

was an across-the-board one. During the 1970s, relative to their initial wealth,
these families expanded their holdings of retail assets, wholesale assets and real-

estate equity all at above-average rates. As they cut their savings rate, single
families markedly shifted the composition of their wealth accumulations. Oneperson single households, which had concentrated on amassing real-estate equity in

the 1960s, accumulated their wealth in financial assets in the 1970s. Larger single
households (people living with friends and relatives) had reallocated wealth from

real-estate equity into financial assets during the 1960s, but reversed the pattern

in the 1970s, apparently in response to improved implicit returns on owneroccupied housing.

Table 9-27 darifies the role of home equity in the saving behavior of
Place Table 9-27 near here

households of different type by tracking trends in homeownership and mortgage
financing by household type. The most marked trends are the continued high use of

leverage by large married households, its increasing use by single and other
nonmarried households, and the increased rate of homeownership for one-person

households. For so-called small savers -- households not wealthy enough to invest
directly in wholesale financial assets, these trends may be interpreted as a form of

29

disintermediation. Small savers with large and stable households found it profit-

able to shift some of their deposit balances into housing. These investments
offered untaxed implicit returns, protection against unanticipated inflation, a
better anticipated real after-tax explicit return than small-denomination accounts,
and a regularized and partially subsidized arrangement for borrowing against small

accumulations of wealth. Even for wealthy households, some of these advantages

apply. In particular, changes in the level and structure of federal capital-gains tax

rates enacted during the 1970s enhanced the tax advantages of owner-occupied
housing relative to stock-market investments.

SUMMARY AND CAUTION

Our analysis of SRC data supports three broad inferences.

First, life-cycle

patterns of accumulation and asset holdings shift importantly with such changes in

the economic environment as inflation risk, tax structure, and transactions costs.

Perhaps because of such shifts, Consistent evidence of average postretirement
decumulation emerged only for cohorts of advanced age. Second, between the
1960s and 1970s, a sharp turnaround occurred in the profiles of household saving
and homeownership. Households whose heads were 55 and older were strong savers
in the 1960s, but younger households proved to be the principal accumulators of the

1970s. A parallel shift in savings propensities occurred between large married or
previously married households and other families, suggesting that movements in the
expected value and variance of the implicit return on owner-occupied housing may

have evoked the adjustment. During the !960s, all age groups increased their
homeownership rates. In the 1970s, large nonsingle households and households
whose heads were under 45 accentuated the trend, while most other households
merely continued it. Third, the compositions of 1962 and 1977 portfolios end up far

30

closer to each other than to 1970 values. This suggests that some of the portfolio
churning observed in SRC data reflects disintermediation that was reversed during
the 1970s as deposit institutions made ceilings on explicit interest less effective by

broadening their product line to develop less-restricted liability instruments and to

expand the ways in which they could pay implicit interest on regulated accounts.

Combined with a capital-gains tax structure that taxed nominal as well as real

price appreciation, these ceilings made the implicit and explicit tax rate on
financial savings rise with the rate of inflation. This lowered the saving rate for

many households and distorted the allocation of transactable wealth between
financial and real-estate assets for everyone.

Because the hypotheses of differential behavior and portfolio churning are

such straightforward ones, this paper emphasizes statistical description over
statistical testing and interpretation. By conventional Chi-square tests, saving and
asset-holding behaviors reported by respondents differ significantly across demographic categories. But we must keep in mind two problems in drawing inferences

from SRC data. First, observations taken at only three points in time cannot
discriminate closely among plausible alternative explanations for observed differences in dass-level behavior. Second, in a survey context the ultimate meaningful-

ness of statistical tests depends on the validity of joint hypotheses about the
appropriateness of the sampling frame and the accuracy of respondent reports.
Validation studies (Ferber et a!. 1969a and 1969b) indicate that noncooperation,

especially among high-income groups, leads to a systematic understatement of
sample variances. Ascertaining the ways in which the three survey observations of

cross-section data on respondent wealth management are each, in fact, representa-

tive of the population of U.S. households is a herculean task. This task can be
accomplished only by carefully examining sampling frames and respondent behavior

31

in alternative data sets and tirelessly endeavoring to reconcile whatever differences emerge.

On the grounds that a mortgage is obviously a financial instrument, we might

have chosen to categorize mortgage debt as a negative financial asset. Our

approach has the advantage of incorporating the portfolio restriction that

mortgage loans are limited to owners of real estate. Programming diff iculties persuaded us to defer our efforts to estimate the market value of
mortgage debt.
