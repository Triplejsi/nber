Housing Price Volatility and Downsizing in Later Life
James Banks, Richard Blundell, Zoë Oldfield, and James P. Smith
NBER Working Paper No. 13496
October 2007
JEL No. D12,D91
ABSTRACT
In this paper, we modeled several types of housing transitions of the elderly in two countries -- Britain
and the United States. One important form of these transitions involves downsizing of housing consumption,
the importance of which among older households is still debated. This downsizing takes multiple forms,
including reductions in the number of rooms per dwelling and the value of the home. There is also
evidence that this downsizing is greater when house price volatility is greater and that American households
try to escape housing price volatility by moving to places that are experience significantly less housing
price volatility. Our comparative evidence in suggests that there is less evidence of downsizing in
Britain. Our results indicate that housing consumption appears to decline with age in the US, even
after controlling for the other demographic and work transitions associated with age that would normally
produce such a decline. No such fall in housing consumption is found in Britain, largely because British
households are much more likely to stay in their original residence.

In this paper we will document and model the housing transitions of the elderly in two
countries—England and the United States. One important form of these transitions involves
downsizing, but there remains considerable controversy even about what the facts are about
downsizing at older ages. This controversy stems partly from the absence until recently of long
panel data on the housing wealth and circumstances of elderly households. It may also flow from
a relatively narrow view of what downsizing is for the purposes of empirical modeling—selling a
home and becoming a renter. Other dimensions that are now possible to analyze include selling a
home to move into a smaller place either as a renter or owner, or moving in with family or
friends, renting out rooms, or simply reducing maintenance and repairs (see Davidoff (2004)).
Thus, in addition to the transition into renting, we will document and model the factors
associated with downsizing across several of these relevant dimensions.1 We will examine the
extent to which these transitions are co-incident or near other salient events such as retirement or
widowhood by estimating models for the empirically important types of housing transitions over
multiple waves of our panel data. While other literature has looked at some of these transitions in
the US, the contribution of our analysis, in addition to broadening the empirical analysis to
include multiple downsizing measures, is to exploit the longer sample periods now available to
look at transitions over a longer horizon where we are more likely to see evidence of downsizing
if it does exist in the data. We also provide, to our knowledge the first systematic comparison of
downsizing behavior between the US and Britain, where there has been much less empirical
evidence on downsizing to date.2
A second contribution of this paper is to discuss and model the potential role of house price
volatility, which we have previously studied by us for younger households’ home ownership and
housing consumption decisions (Banks et al. (2003, 2005)), in the housing decisions of the

1

Less immediately transparent forms of downsizing - reducing additions and repairs or renting
out rooms - will be dealt with, to the extent that data allow, in subsequent research.

older households in the UK between 1988 and 1994.

elderly. In addition to any type of downsizing in housing consumption that may occur, some
housing transitions at older ages may reflect an attempt to escape from the risk associated with a
highly price volatile asset given the relatively short remaining life span. For example, housing
price risk at older ages may encourage moving to less price volatile areas but leave intact
ownership status as well as the level of real housing consumption. Among those who do sell their
homes to buy another, we will therefore also document the transitions between housing-price safe
and volatile areas even if home size does not change.
Since it places the future flow of non-housing consumption at risk, greater housing price
risk provides an incentive to reduce housing consumption more quickly (at an earlier age) or
equivalently to downsize in all forms. Greater (mean preserving) price risk increases the
probability that individuals will want to increase their savings in safe assets. Since holding a
house in a volatile area is not a safe asset, this implies that the desire to downsize is greater when
house price risks are higher. These effects will be mitigated to the extent households have
annuitized incomes.
Because housing price volatility is temporally and spatially variable, our empirical analysis
will document the importance of the role of house price volatility using comparable panel data
analysis for the US and Britain. One reason motivating our choice of comparison countries is the
significant differences in housing price variability between these two countries—Britain has
considerably higher house price volatility, with the relatively safe regions having comparable
volatility to the most risky regions of the US (see Banks et al. (2005) for example). Consequently,
if volatility matters one might expect differences in downsizing behavior across countries.
Of course there may be many other differences between the two countries and hence, in
contrast to the descriptive evidence comparing the two countries, our empirical analysis will
exploit within country regional and time-series variation in volatility to identify the effects of
volatility on downsizing behavior. This distinction between these two approaches turns out to be

4

important. At the broadest level, our descriptive comparison of the two countries reveals less
downsizing behavior in Britain than in the US—a result at odds with the idea that higher volatility
should lead to greater downsizing. Once we look within country and also control for other
covariates, however, we find a positive correlation between downsizing and volatility in the US,
and a qualitatively similar although statistically weaker effect within Britain. This suggests that
other differences between the two countries are driving the international differences and some
potential factors are discussed briefly in the spirit of topics for future research.
A third contribution of our paper is to examine more generally the long contested issue of
whether households in both countries at sufficiently old age reduce their consumption. In
particular the question we ask is whether consumption of housing declines in addition to any
changes induced by a set of demographic changes producing smaller households and the decision
to retire from the labor force. Since housing is an important component of total consumption and
if anything is believed to one of the resistant to any downward changes, we believe that evidence
showing a downward path of housing consumption adds important evidence to the more general
debate on the nature of consumption trajectories at older ages.
This paper is divided into six sections. Section 1 outlines and discusses implications from
a simple theoretical model of the impact of housing price variability on life-cycle choices
regarding housing decisions with an emphasis on its implications for downsizing during late life.
Section 2 describes the data sources used in both Britain and US. Section 3 documents the
principal facts about the extent of different forms of late life downsizing in both countries and
their possible relation to housing price variability within and between Britain and US. In Section
4 we summarize the predictions to be tested and provide the results of the empirical tests of our
model. Section 5 uses the results of previous sections to present and discuss age-trajectories of
housing consumption at older ages in the two countries. In the final section we present our
conclusions.

1. Theoretical Model

Economic theory has implications about the possibility of downsizing at older ages for
a number of reasons. As families progress through the life cycle, the demand for the
consumption of housing services is likely to fall. For example, it is a standard implication of life
cycle models that at sufficiently older ages as mortality risks rise, total household consumption
(of which housing is an important part) will fall with age. While the extent of the actual fall in

total household consumption remains a matter of active debate, it appears to be the case that
at sufficiently older ages household consumption does indeed fall with age, most likely
reflecting the combined influences of time preferences and mortality risk. When total
consumption falls, housing consumption should also fall since if it did not, all reductions in
total consumption would have to take place in non-housing consumption alone.
1.1 The Demographic Ladder
The second and perhaps more immediately apparent reason that one might expect
reductions in housing consumption at older ages are demographic. One useful description of the
demographic forces is the housing ladder, which we see as demographically driven as individuals
marry, form families with children aging and growing in their housing needs. Eventually people
complete their family building with older children starting to leave home to go off on their own.
Figure 1.A depicts this demographic process by plotting by age for the United States three
dimensions of the demographic ladder—the fraction of families who had completed their family,
the fraction of families who ever have had a child at least five years old, and the fraction of
families who currently have a child at least five years old in the household.3 A parallel set of
graphs are provided for Britain in Figure 1.B.

3

This figure plots the cumulative fraction of individuals who completed their family size by age. This was obtained
from data on individuals aged 50 and over by taking the age at which they had their last child as being the age they
completed their family.

6

The demographic housing life-cycle can be divided into five broad stages: In the first
stage, an individual is living with their parents; in the second, they form partnerships; and in
the third goes on to have children and complete their family size. In the remainder of the life
cycle, in stage four, children leave home; and the final stage is widowhood. At each stage,
there is a decision to buy or rent and a decision about a minimum level of housing
consumption necessary to meet needs. The demography depicted in Figures 1.A and 1.B,
which are remarkably similar in both countries, indicates that housing demand will grow
during the early and middle parts of life, but may then reverse as children leave home and go
off on their own.
Since the fraction of families with a child over age 5 in the household peaks around age
forty in both countries, the fraction of families with children under age 18 will peak in the
mid fifties and the demographically driven demand for housing should peak at this age or before.
Multiple children should matter as well in housing demand. Further reductions in housing
demand at older ages will flow from divorce and/or widowhood as people enter the final stage of
life without a partner.
1.2 Housing Price Risk
The third factor that may influence decisions to downsize concerns the influence of housing
price risk. In an earlier paper (Banks, Blundell, Oldfield, and Smith (2005)), we investigated the
influence of housing price risk on the decision to own a home during rising upward part of the
demographic housing ladder. To summarize, one possible solution to the changing housing
demand over the life cycle is to simply purchase the amount of housing one requires at each
stage, but high transactions costs serve as an effective barrier to that strategy.
Another solution would be to rent in the early stages and then purchase the ‘right’
presumably larger home when family size is complete. The difficulty with that strategy is that
housing price volatility may means that you are priced out of this market at the time when you

7

need to purchase your family home. Since there are no market insurance devices that can insure
against this risk, one can only self-insure against the future housing price volatility. To provide
this insurance, a household wishes to hold an asset with a value correlated with house prices they
will face in the future. Holding housing equity essentially provides some insurance against high
house prices later. Since, in the absence of a formal market, the only way to obtain housing equity
is to buy a house, to insure themselves, individuals must purchase a house earlier than they may
have wanted based on housing consumption demographic needs alone. Thus, the more volatile
house prices are, the greater the insurance motive of owning a house in the early phrases of the
demographic ladder depicted in Figure 1.
This paper is motivated by an extension of our model into the older stages of the life
cycle—the stage that involves children leaving home and widowhood. Are people willing to
downsize in order to fund their retirement consumption, and how is this decision affected by the
presence of volatile house prices?
The integration of housing price risk into a single theoretical framework is complex and
even algebraic closed form solutions will only be possible under certain forms of preferences.
Ideally, however, we want such a framework to use relatively flexible preferences (such as
CRRA) that also have some minimum housing needs or requirement that must be met in each
period and as such analytical solutions can be hard to come by. We have confirmed the
predictions that follow in a numerical simulation of a simple three period model of the latter
stages of life to capture the stages of the demographic ladder identified in the previous section,
with CRRA utility, house price risk, a minimum housing requirement that rises and then falls
with the housing ladder, and a simplified form of mortality risk. For the purposes of this paper,
and in the absence of analytical results, we focus instead on intuitive descriptions of the
mechanisms in play.

8

The first thing to note is that the model is not symmetric with regard to the role of
volatility in early as opposed to late life. In the rising phrase of the housing ladder, individuals
wants to self-insure so that they will not be forced to live in a house that is too small when their
housing demand is high in mid-life. In volatile areas, expected price volatility induces one to
move into home ownership at a younger age and hence to reduce consumption of other goods.
On the later rungs of the household ladder however housing is no longer required in order
to meet an insurance need. Instead, when household size is no longer expected to rise, housing
reverts to a more straightforward risky asset which individuals (if they are risk averse) may wish
to avoid Put simply, in the later stages of life or the downsize of the housing ladder, one may
want to release some housing consumption to consume other goods. Greater housing price risk
(whether in the form of greater house equity for a given level of risk, or greater risk for a given
level of equity) puts that decision at risk, thereby encouraging homeowners in more price volatile
areas to either downsize more rapidly than they might have wanted, to rent, or to move to areas
with less house price volatility. Another option is equity withdrawal or reverse mortgages, which
not only provide some insurance against mortality risk but also slowly reduces uncertainty about
the equity. But like many annuities this market is quite thin, perhaps due to standard adverse
selection issues.
Downsizing essentially involves cashing in housing equity. You want to do this because
you want to use housing wealth to finance future non-housing consumption, but as with any
approaching asset realization, an optimal path would be to gradually reduce risk and move into
safe assets to avoid exposure to shocks at the time of realization that will have permanent effects.
(This is a mechanism directly analogous to the prediction in the pensions literature that as
retirement approaches the optimal pension portfolio is to gradually switch out of stocks and into
bonds).

9

There are, of course, many good reasons why individuals may not want to downsize. One is
that they may have build up a ‘habitual’ demand for this house as they may over time have fitted
it to their tastes, or they may want children to return to the home in which they were raised. The
cost of not downsizing is that all other consumption may have to absorb more of the fall.
If you do decide to downsize, the specific timing may be coordinated with other salient
events—indeed our description of the housing ladder is event-specific as opposed to age or timespecific. One event may be retirement since one’s work is location-specific even in there is
housing price risk. The other is widowhood or other forms of marital dissolution where, at a
minimum, the old house may be too big. Thus, any downsizing that does take place may be
correlated with retirement, widowhood, or divorce and our empirical analysis will need to allow
for these transitions.
In the discussion above we have not addressed the issue that, conditional on location, house
price volatility may not be avoidable by switching to the rental sector, since rental prices may be
more volatile as well in such areas, which may indeed generate a demand for owner-occupation to
avoid rent risk (see Sinai and Souleles (2005)). Several things are worth mentioning here. Firstly,
the mechanisms discussed above relate to stock of housing wealth as opposed to the flows of
period by period housing costs associated with ownership or rental respectively. Although once
mortgages are paid off, the risk associated with house price fluctuations for home-owners is all
related to the value of assets and not post-housing cost incomes so the relative comparison of
ownership to rental is changed in favor of owner-occupation the fact that horizons are shorter
would weaken the importance of such an effect.
Second, in our framework, switching from an owner to a renter is just one way that an
individual can choose to downsize. This means that our framework is compatible with that of
Sinai and Souleles because individuals who wish to avoid both rental risk and house price risk
can do so by downsizing in ways which they can remain an owner occupier. Finally, even when it
comes to home-ownership itself, in contrast to the up stage of the ladder the prediction here is that

10

more volatility would lead to lower ownership rates—a mechanism that would work against that
described above so if anything. To the extent that the above two considerations do not totally
remove the relevance of rental price risk (relative to ownership) in volatile areas, we may be
underestimating the effect of volatility in our empirical models.
1.3 Other Risks
Of course, other risks that may or may not be correlated with house price risk, may also
matter for households’ housing and downsizing decisions. Perhaps the two most natural to think
of are income risk and mortality or morbidity risk. On the assumption that most downsizing takes
place at or after retirement, income risk is most likely of only second order importance since there
is no earnings risk and large fractions of the incomes of retired households may well have some
degree of inflation protection.
More important is likely to be health risks, and there are several ways in which additional
health risk may also affect housing wealth and non-housing wealth accumulation and
decumulation decisions at older ages. Especially when health insurance is not complete, it
increases the risks of additional out-of-pocket expenditures, particularly at the tails, which should
encourage additional precautionary savings.
Before retirement, morbidity risk also shows up as one of the determinants of income risk
and thus will have effects similar to those described in the previous section. Holding a risky asset
such as housing when prices are highly volatile may be a dubious strategy when one faces
additional health risk. A spread in pure mortality risk (making it more likely you will live longer
as well as shorter) will make risk-averse agents engage in more precautionary savings in all forms
in face of an added risk of living too long. This effect will depend both on the extent to which
retirement incomes have been annuitized (which varies a great deal across our countries) and the
importance of any bequest motive that might exist. We will not incorporate health risk into this

11

draft but note that it is an important topic, on which we are gradually gaining a better empirical
understanding, for inclusion in future drafts.
2. Sources of Data
This research will rely on micro-data from the US and Britain. For the US, we will use the
Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) and primarily the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics
(PSID). For Britain, we will use the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS). Besides the
standard set of demographics on age, schooling, family income, marriage and other aspects of
family building, outcomes information available in all these surveys include several aspects of
housing choice—ownership, size of house, and value of house.
HRS
This research uses a set of surveys of the over-age 50 population: the original Health and
Retirement Study (HRS-original) and the Assets and Health Dynamics of the Oldest Old
(AHEAD. HRS-original is a national sample of about 7,600 households (12,654 individuals) with
at least one person in the birth cohorts of 1931-1941 (about 51-61 years old at baseline). AHEAD
includes 6,052 households (8,222 individuals) with at least one person born in 1923 or earlier (70
or over in 1993). Follow-ups have taken place at two-year intervals.
HRS housing section includes wave-by-wave data about tenure (renter or owner), value and
purchase price of the home, outstanding mortgages (and hence home equity) and monthly
mortgage payments, whether the household refinanced since the last interview, other fixed
payments (e.g., property taxes, fuels, etc), rents (if a renter), and number of rooms. Information is
also available on second homes. In this draft of the paper, HRS is used simply to confirm the
principal patterns of changing housing demand obtained from the PSID during later life.
The Panel Study of Income Dynamics
The PSID has gathered almost 30 years of extensive economic and demographic data on a
nationally representative sample of approximately 5,000 (original) families and 35,000

12

individuals who live in those families. Details on family income and its components have been
gathered in each wave since the inception of PSID in 1967. Starting in 1984 and in five-year
intervals until 1999, PSID asked questions to measure household wealth. Starting in 1997, the
PSID switched to a two-year periodicity, and wealth modules are now part of the core interview.
In each wave, the PSID asks detailed questions on family size and composition, schooling,
education, age, and marital status. State of residence is available in every year and individuals are
followed to new locations if they move. Unlike other American wealth surveys, PSID is
representative of the complete age distribution. Yearly housing tenure questions determine
whether individuals own, rent or live with others. Questions on value and mortgage were asked in
each wave of the PSID. Renters are asked the rent they pay and both owners and renters are asked
the number of rooms in the residence. Health conditions and timing of onset were added in 1999.
British Household Panel Survey—BHPS
The BHPS has been running annually since 1991 and, like the PSID, is also representative
of the complete age distribution. The wave 1 sample consisted of some 5,500 households and
10,300 individuals. The BHPS contains annual information on individual and household income
and employment as well as a complete set of demographic variables and has several other
features to recommend it. There is an extensive amount of information on mortgages and housing
(including number of rooms) that enables us to measure housing wealth in each wave of the data4.
Regional variation in ownership and housing wealth accumulation will be essential in our tests
and the data will provide us with sufficient observations per year in each region to carry out our
tests.
Housing Price Volatility
For the US, housing price data to measure housing price risk were obtained form the Office
of Federal Housing Enterprise (OFHEO) House Price Index. This data contain quarterly and

4

With the exception of 1992 when house value was only collected for those living at new addresses.

13

yearly price indexes for the value of single-family homes in the US in the individual states and
the District of Columbia.5 This data use repeat transactions for the same houses to obtain a quality
constant index and is available for all years starting in 1974. All yearly housing prices by state are
reported relative to those that prevailed in 1980. By 1995 there were almost 7 million repeat
transactions in the data so that the number of observations for each state is reasonably large. No
demographic data are available with this index.
For Britain, regional house price data to measure housing price risk will be obtained from
the Nationwide Building Society House Price series, which is a quarterly regional house price
series going back to 1974. Rather than use a repeat sales index, the prices are adjusted for
changes in the mix of sales to approximate a composition constant index, and are also seasonally
adjusted.
As with our previous paper (Banks et al 2006), housing volatility is defined using a
moving five-year window. That is, our measure of volatility is the standard deviation of the house
price around its trend in the five-years prior to the observation. What should matter for individual
decisions of course is the conditional variance of expected house prices over the individuals
horizon and in this respect our measure is only crude, intending simply to capture that the recent
past might be used as a prediction of the future. Nevertheless, sensitivity analysis in previous
papers revealed the empirical conclusions to be broadly unaffected by choice of window-length
within reasonable ranges, and subject to the constraints of, and subsequent impacts on, the
amount of time-series variation available. Finally, with regard to picking out regional as opposed
to time-series variation in volatility, we are confident that the measure picks out the risky from
the safe regions both within and across countries.
3. Establishing the Facts

14

Even the basic question of whether housing is downsized as people age is not well
answered in the literature. For example, Venti and Wise (2001) concluded, based on the AHEAD
data in the United States, that, after controlling for transitions into widow hood and nursing
homes, the elderly do not generally reduce housing equity as they age. Yet, Sheiner and Weil
(1992) estimated that among households entering old age owning a home, just 41% still own
when the surviving spouse dies.
One source of the differences that emerge in the current literature is that moving out of
home ownership is only but one form downsizing may take. Individuals may sell the original
family home to move into a smaller one whilst remaining owners either in the same or a different
general location. They can also remain home owners even if the size of the home is the same but
move to a less expensive and less volatile place. They may also invest less in upkeep of their
home, an implicit form of downsizing, or rent a room out. Or, they may move into the home of
another relative (especially children) or have them move into their own home, perhaps with
shared ownership. The years around labor market retirement and the death of a spouse may be
especially important ones for these transitions. Very little is currently known about the magnitude
and reasons for these broader cumulative transitions or about any international differences that
might exist. In this section, we document the principal empirical facts around these issues in both
the United States and the United Kingdom.
3.a Home Ownership Rates at Older Ages
Especially at older ages most Americans are homeowners. Based on multiple waves of the
PSID, Table 1.a presents tenure status for individuals by age of the household head for ten year
age groups starting at age 50, concluding with a residual category of those 80 plus years old.
Using the same format, Table 1.b lists parallel data derived from the BHPS for individuals in
Britain. For both countries, the data are also stratified by whether or not the household lives in an
area characterized by volatile housing prices.

15

Table 1.a shows that slightly more than eighty percent of all American individuals over age
50 are homeowners. Approximately one in every six Americans in this age group are renters,
while a relatively small fraction are in the catch all ‘other categories’ that largely consist of living
with relatives or in a nursing home. Among older Americans, there is a gradual decline in the
fraction who are home owners across age groups post age 70. Below age 70, home ownership
rates are about 83%—above age 80 the rate is 66%. Most of the decline in the probability of
owning a home appears as an increase in renting but some of it, particularly among those over age
70, reflects an increase in the likelihood of living with others or in a nursing home.
For British individuals over age 50 (summarized in Table 1.b), the probability of being a
homeowner is about thirteen percentage points lower than that of American individuals, a deficit
mostly offset by a higher probability of renting. There is a much sharper negative age pattern in
Britain compared to the US across the age groups depicted in Table 1. Among those in their
fifties for example, there is less than a seven percentage point difference in home ownership rates
between the two countries—by ages 80+ the likelihood of owning a home is seventeen
percentage points lower in Britain compared to the US. As documented in Banks, Blundell, and
Smith (2003), this sharp negative age gradient in home owning rates in Britain largely reflects
cohort effects and the sale at subsidized rates of government owned council housing.
In the United States, homeownership rates are much higher in non-risky housing price
locales than in the risky ones. One might be tempted to attribute this difference to the fact that
housing prices are also considerably higher in the risky places, but that temptation is deterred by
the fact that the reverse pattern appears in to be the case in Britain even though housing prices in
Britain are also higher in the more volatile housing price places.
3.b Changes in Housing Tenure with Age
Our principal concern in this paper involves not homeownership status per se but rather the
transitions in tenure that takes place at older ages. The very pronounced cohort effects in housing
status in Britain documented in the previous section indicate that it would be perilous to attempt

16

to read housing transitions from cross-sectional age housing tenure patterns, especially in Britain.
Instead, in this section we will highlight the salient transitions using the panel nature of the data
in the US and Britain.
Since much of the existing research on downsizing at older ages focuses on the decision to
sell one’s original home and become a renter, we begin with the transitions conditional or
originally being a homeowner. Table 2 examines these tenure transitions in the United States
(using the PSID) and Britain (using the BHPS) for a sub population who are at least fifty years
old and who were originally home owners in the initial period. Because the extent of the
transitions that place will depend on the length of the window during which we allow households
to adjust their status, the data are presented for three different durations between the waves of the
panel—two years apart, five years apart, and ten years apart. All tenure transitions are presented
separately for risky and non-risky price areas. Finally, Table 3 organizes the data in precisely the
same way for those who were initially renters.
These two year transitions may illustrate why there is some skepticism about downsizing
being an important dimension of behavior at older ages. Across a two year period, only eleven
percent of American homeowners move and only one in twenty relocate during a single year.
Such mobility is even less in Britain where only about six percent of British home owning
households relocate over a two year horizon. However, as we allow the number of years between
the survey waves to expand, the extent of mobility taking place increases significantly. To
illustrate, over a decade, almost one in every three American home owners who were at least fifty
years old moved out of an originally owned home. Among those Americans who did move,
however, 71% of them remained homeowners by purchasing another home. Another 22% of them
became renters while the rest do a collection of things, including moving in with family members
or into group dwellings.
Mobility among homeowners is clearly less in Britain for older households. Across the
same ten year span between survey waves, about one in every four British homeowners relocated

17

compared to about one in three American households. In these simple tabulations, in neither
Britain nor the US does an owner’s propensity to sell a home appear to depend on whether one
lives in a housing price risky or non-risky locale.
Table 3 demonstrates that—not surprisingly—renters in both countries are far more mobile
than owners. Across the ten year survey interval, 72% of American renters moved at least once
compared to 40% of British renters so that once again British households are less mobile than
their American counterparts. Most of these originally renting households remain so and simply
settle into another apartment or flat. But a little more than one in every four American renters
who do relocate over age fifty subsequently become homeowners—the comparable British
number is one third. While these transitions rates were similar between risky and non-risky areas
for home owners, it appears that renters in non-risky areas are more likely to move in the US.
Table 4 displays patterns of housing tenure transitions by ten year age groups for those
owners who are at least age 50 and Table 5 does the same for those who were originally renters.
In the United States, until after 80, roughly two-thirds of home owners do not move to another
place over a ten year window. However, among those who do move, a growing fraction of them
do not purchase another home. Rather they increasingly move into rental properties and to a less
extent into either assisted living or to stay with family members. The probability of a homeowner
moving into a rental property is far less in Britain than in the US and it is a good deal less likely
at older ages for an home owner in Britain to subsequently become a renter.
In the United States and in Britain, renters become increasingly less mobile with age, once
again with an important exception noted during the 80s in the US. Forty-one percent of American
renters in their seventies stay in the same place over a ten year horizon compared to twenty-two
percent of American renters in the fifties. Across all age groups, many more American renters
relocate in the non-risky areas compared to the risky ones.
Table 5 demonstrates that a good deal of the additional mobility among renters in the US in
non-risky areas involves larger movements from renter to owner status (compared to the risky

18

areas). To this point, we have emphasized the incentives involved in these housing decisions from
the point of view of owners. However, the arguments are completely symmetric. From the
perspective of those who were originally renters, changing from being a renter to an owner of
housing in a house price risky area would make little sense indeed. That transition is less
problematic in places where housing price risk is less problematic. Thus our model predicts that
mobility of owners should be higher in housing price risky areas but mobility of renters should be
the reverse- that is mobility will be higher among renters in the non-risky areas.

3.c Changes in the Number of Rooms
In addition to changing ownership status—the most commonly used measure of
downsizing—another form may involve selling an existing home and buying a new one that is
spatially smaller or constitute less housing consumption in other ways. One definition of
objective home size available in all our data sets is the number of rooms. Using the PSID for
those ages fifty or more, Table 6 examines changes in the number of rooms of the primary
dwelling among those who changed residences between the waves of the data. These patterns are
presented by type of area (whether a risky price area or not), initial type of housing tenure (owner
or renter), and three time durations between the PSID waves—two, five, and ten years.
These data indicate convincingly that among older Americans once they decide to relocate
that they do tend to move into a smaller dwelling. On average, the new house is around 0.7 of a
room smaller than the prior one, a scaling down of about 16% using rooms as the metric. This
tendency to downsize is almost entirely due to a movement to smaller places among those who
were initially homeowners. Moreover, most of that reduction in size is due to those who change
in housing tenure from owner to renter—a new rental dwelling that is on average two and a third
rooms smaller than the prior owned one. But—especially as the duration between the waves of
the PSID increases—even those who remain homeowners purchase a new home that is on
average about one third of a room smaller.

19

At least in these univariate descriptive statistics, this tendency of Americans home owners to
downsize their house at older ages appears to be somewhat stronger if they originally lived in a
risky housing price area. This is especially the case amongst those home owners who sell and
then buy another home. Using the ten year interval horizon, the change in the number of rooms is
twice as high in the risky areas when homeowners buy another home. In non-risky areas, there is
little difference in size of dwelling among renters but renters do appear to downsize in the risky
area.
One limitation of the PSID is that sample sizes become thin once one stratifies by age.
Tables 7 and 8 list similar data on the changing number of rooms associated with housing
mobility for two HRS cohorts where relatively long horizons are possible to track housing
changes. Table 7 provides data from the original HRS cohort (those 51-61 years old in 1992)
while Table 8 does the same for the AHEAD cohort (those 70+ years old in 1993.) These two
cohorts are of particular interest since the first captures transitions associated with the pre
retirement years while the second focuses on the nature of post-retirement mobility.
During the pre-retirement years, we do find a tendency of Americans to downsize, but this
is concentrated completely on home owners and appears to be more pronounced in the price risky
places. Over a ten year ten horizon, homeowners who lived in price risky areas when they moved
reduced the size of their dwelling by 1.6 rooms if they became a renter and half a room on
average if they remained a home owner. The comparable figures for those in less housing price
risky areas were about a one room reduction if they became a renter and a .8 reduction if they
remained a homeowner—about half as large as the amount of downsizing taking place among
those living in the price risky areas.
If anything these size reductions appear to be even larger in the post retirement AHEAD
cohort who are examined in Table 8. Conditional on relocation, there is a tendency to move to a
smaller place even if one remains a homeowner. This tendency is much stronger among those
who initially resided in a place with a lot of housing price risk.

20

The comparable data on number of rooms for the sample ages fifty plus in Britain are
contained in Table 9 based on data from the BHPS. Downsizing at older ages characterizes
households in both countries although it is a less pervasive phenomenon in Britain than in the US.
The term less pervasive applies not only to a smaller probability of changing residences at all at
older ages in Britain, but also to a smaller change in the size of dwelling given that a move takes
place. If we compare Tables 6 and 9, the changes in number of rooms are almost half as large in
Britain compared to the US. The principal difference lies in the switch from owner to renter status
where the reduction in number of rooms in Britain is 1.4 compared to 2.2 in the US. As was the
case in America, the magnitude of the downsizing that takes place is somewhat larger in the
housing price risky areas of Britain compared to places with more stable housing prices.
3.d Escaping Housing Price Volatility
Even when older householders remain home owners and stay in a home of approximately
the same size, they can avoid some of the costs of housing price risk by moving to places where
housing prices are less volatile. The data contained in tables 10.a (for the US) and 10.b (for
Britain) indicate that this is precisely what takes place. For those who moved, these tables
measure the difference in our measure of housing price risk (the standard deviation in housing
prices) between the area where they originally lived and the area to which they moved. Thus, a
positive negative number indicates that the area that they left was characterized by more housing
price volatility than the area to which they moved—that is the household was reducing their
exposure to housing price risk. In addition to age stratification, the data in Table 9 (based on the
PSID) and Table 10 (based on the BHPS) are stratified by whether one was originally an owner
or a renter and within each housing tenure type by the housing tenure type to which one moved.
Additional data for the American sample based on the two HRS cohorts are provided in Appendix
Table 1. In these tables, the American units of volatility were defined as ten times the British
units.

21

There are a number of salient patterns, foremost of which is that after age 50 when they do
move people move on average to a place with less housing price volatility. The tendency of
Americans to move to less price volatile areas peaks during the dominant retirement years (ages
60-69) and actually reverses after age 80. This may not be surprising since housing decisions at
very old age may have more to do with attempts to provide care for the elderly when they become
frailer. This would include moving to assisted living communities and to live with relatives.
Second, as predicted by the theory, the tendency to move to areas with less price volatility
is far more prevalent among homeowners than among renters. The difference for Americans in
the pre and post standard deviation of housing prices is six times larger among homeowners
compared to renters. Among homeowners, there is almost no change in volatility if the one
changes status from being an owner to a renter but a very large one if one remains a homeowner.
These data on the change in housing price volatility associated with a move are also arrayed
by the length of the time transition between the surveys. The longer the time duration between the
surveys the greater the difference in location specific price volatility associated with the move.
This effect is particularly large among those who were originally in their fifties. In this age group,
the longer the time duration examined the more likely the move is associated with the retirement
decision, where other factors are less likely to play a major role.
With this consideration in mind, Appendix Table 1 presents a similar array of data for two
important cohorts in the HRS data. The first is the original HRS cohort, those who were 51-61
years old in 1992. This cohort was largely in the immediate pre-retirement phrase of the life cycle
when the survey began. The second is the AHEAD cohort, a random sample of individuals who
were at least 70 years old in 1970. Most of these individuals were in the post-retirement phrase of
life. Individuals in both cohorts tend to move to less price volatile locations when they do move,
especially if they were originally homeowners and especially if they remain home owners after
the move. However, the escaping of price volatility is much larger in the pre-retirement cohort
especially as the duration of time between the survey snapshots increases. One reason that this

22

effect is smaller in the post retirement AHEAD cohort is that many of them have already moved
after retirement to a less price volatile place.
Table 10.b lists parallel numbers for Britain. Just as in the States, British citizens also tend
to move to less volatile housing areas if they do decide to move, but on average the escape from
volatility is less dramatic there than in the US. In spite of this similarity, there are some
important differences between the two countries as well. For example, the escape from volatility
in Britain appears not to vary substantially by age and also appears to be as large among renters
as among owners.
4. Model Estimates
We will estimate a number of empirical models that relate to the downsizing decisions at
older ages. These models include the following for those who did change residences across the
waves of the data (i.e., movers); the change in the number of rooms, the change in the price
volatility of the location in which one lives, and the change in the value of the house (for those
who remained home owners). Since these models condition on the decision to move, we also use
the full sample to estimate a probit model of the decision to change residence (where our
dependent variable takes a value of one if the individual moves) and the change in the number of
rooms. Having these two models side by side allows us to distinguish between the effects of
variables on the probability of moving and then conditional on that probability the probability that
one downsizes housing. These models are also combined into a single model of downsizing at
older ages.
We include in all models the following sets of demographic variables—a set of five year
age dummies beginning at ages 50-54 with those ages 80 and over the reference group, the
change in the number of people living in the house, three marital status transitions (marriedsingle, single-married, single-single with married-married as the omitted group), and children
living at home transitions (kids-no kids, no kids-kids, no kids-no kids with kids-kids as the

23

omitted group). The marital and child transition variables tell us, conditional on the changes in
the number of residents, whether the type of resident matters. For example, one might suspect that
children would matter more than spouses in these transitions since they might have a bigger
impact on the number of rooms. Because not all transitions from married to single are the same,
we also include a dummy variable for whether or not one became widowed across the waves.
The probability of moving and hence the possibility of downsizing may be related to work
transitions including retirement that take place at these ages. Therefore, a set of work transitions
are included in these models (work-no work, no work-work, no work-no work with work-work as
the omitted category). Unlike the demographic variables above which are common to the family
unit, the work variables are individual level variables.
The economic variables include the ln of real annual income and education, measured by
years of schooling. In the United States education is separated into three groups—13-16 years of
schooling, 16 or more years of schooling with 12 or fewer years the reference group. In Britain
we construct broadly comparable groups based on educational qualifications—the lowest
education (reference) group are those with compulsory schooling only, the middle group has
some post-compulsory schooling or vocational qualifications but less than a college degree, and
the final group has college degrees or higher.
We also include a measure of baseline house value (for home owners only) and home
equity and baseline housing price volatility. A linear time trend is part of all models. The data
used for estimation are based a sample of individuals ages fifty and more using the PSID for the
United States (for all years 1968-1999) and the BHPS for Britain (years 1993-20046).
4.1 The Probability of Moving

derivatives and the associated z statistics obtained from probit models of the probability of

Although the BHPS sample began in 1991, data on house value was only collected for those who were
interviewed at a new address in 1992. Since our models are based on differences, we effectively have data
starting in 1993.

24

changing residence (leaving aside the issue of changing areas or locations for the time being). For
each country, models are estimated across three time horizons—one, five, and ten years.
If we examine first the set of transition variables included in the model (marriage, kids, and
work), the reference group (married-married, kids-kids, and work-work) is generally the one least
associated with residential mobility. Next in line tends to be the other category which also does
not involve a transition between states over the time period under consideration (single-single, no
kids-no kids, and no work-no work). The higher effect compared to the reference group may
reflect lagged effects of transitions into the single, no kids, or no work states. If a marriage
transition did take place, the demographic one most likely to lead to higher residential mobility
are from single to married. Compared to the transition from married to single of which it is a part,
becoming widowed is less likely to result in mobility presumably since it is not necessary that
somewhat move in this case. The impact of kids leaving home on mobility appears to be larger in
the US than it is in Britain. The estimated magnitude of these demographic transitions effects do
not change significantly with the time horizon over which the effects are estimated. The two work
transitions are about equally likely to induce additional mobility in both countries. The results are
generally remarkably similar in the two countries with the principal transitional difference taking
place in the dimension of the kids at home variables.
We next describe the estimated impacts of the economic variables included in the models.
Several dimensions of economic resources are measured, including ln household income,
education, whether or not one is initially a home owner, house value and home equity among
home owners. Statistically significant positive education and income effects are estimated for
both countries, effects that increase in size with the duration of the horizon. Given the stage of the
life-cycle that we are examining, income is not a proxy for job market opportunities in alternative
labor markets. These are more likely income effects that capture the ability to finance moves and
the ability to purchase amenities associated with localities that are no longer tied to jobs.

25

Consistent with the descriptive tables above, home owners in both countries are less mobile
than renters even after controlling for this set of economic and demographic variables . However,
conditional on being a home owner in both countries, mobility rises with the value of the house
but declines with home equity when both variables are in the model. One interpretation of the
home value effect (in addition to the normal income effect mentioned above) is that as the value
of home goes up people are consuming a lot of housing relative to their income inducing them to
want to downsize their house. Conditional of the value of the house, and increase in home equity
is equivalent to a reduction in the stock and flow of mortgage payments which makes it less likely
that people move to reduce those payments.
We estimate positive but statistically weak impacts of price volatility on mobility in
Britain. One reason for not being able to estimate volatility effects in Britain may be that there
are much fewer years over which to estimate the volatility effect in Britain, a point which will
become a theme in what follows. Particularly for the longer differences the time-series variation
is extremely limited in the British sample—with 12 years of data we have t=2 for a ten-year
difference—and since our identification of the volatility effects depends on time-series as well as
regional variation there is only a very limited extent to which we could detect volatility effects.
We estimate a negative effect of price volatility in the US, that is higher price volatility is
associated with a lower probability of moving. As explained above, there is no unambiguous
prediction of the effect of price volatility on the geographic mobility. On the one hand, higher
price volatility should encourage owners to move in order to either downsize or escape the
volatility. On the other hand, higher price volatility makes renters more constrained in their
moves since they should not be eager to change their tenure status by buying a house. To test this
idea, we ran separate models in the US for the ten year horizon for owners and renters. The
estimated effect (derivative) of volatility on mobility was 0.001 (z= 3.26) for owners and -0.003
(z= 5.92) for renters. These results also suggest that it more be more appropriate to estimate the

26

models on alternative forms of transitions (owners-owners, owners-renters, renters-owners, or
renters- renters) for the predictions differ.
Conditional on the attributes included in the model (which include incomes which will be
growing with time), negative mobility time trends are estimated in the United States and no time
trends in Britain. Finally, especially as the horizon expands to the ten year interval, we find that in
the United States those ages 80 and over are the most mobile. This no doubt reflects the
increasing necessity of moving into assisted living arrangements or moving in with relatives as
individuals’ health deteriorates at very old age. However, amongst the other age groups, those in
their fifties are the most mobile with mobility falling until people are in their early seventies. In
contrast, mobility in Britain is lowest amongst those eighty or more years old and peaks amongst
those in their late fifties.
4.2 The Change in the Number of Rooms—Movers
The decision to move at older ages does not necessarily imply that downsizing of housing
is occurring. For that to be true, those who do move would have to reduce their housing
consumption in some form. The most direct quantitative measure of housing consumption
available in both countries is the number of rooms per dwelling. Tables 12.a (for the United
States) and 12.b (for Britain) list estimated coefficients and the associated t statistics obtained
from OLS models of the change in the number of rooms per dwelling estimated across a sample
of movers. Once again, models are estimated across three time horizons—one, five, and ten years.
Demographic attributes of the household are not surprisingly strong predictors of the
magnitude of housing demand. Reductions in the size of household (the dominant direction of
change during this phrase of the life-cycle) are strongly associated with reductions in the number
of rooms. The impact of people moving out also depends on the types of people who are leaving.
In the United States, having no remaining children at home or having a spouse leave the home
reduces the size of the house while entry does the opposite. In the United States, the difference

27

between spouses and no children are not all that large suggesting that this is not simply a
bedroom effect. Lag effects of prior exit are no doubt operating as well since the no spouse-no
spouse and no kid-no kid are both associated with reductions in the size of the dwelling.
Conditional on changes in the number of household members, these demographic composition
effects associated with children are much smaller and less consistent in Britain compared to the
US. Marriage effects are more similar in the two countries.
However, while work transitions were strongly correlated with mobility in both countries,
they have little impact on the size of dwelling unless they are also accompanied by demographic
changes in the household structure. The extent of downsizing, at least as measured in this
dimension, appears to increase with age in both countries. This age pattern becomes particularly
steep after age 70 when the evidence appears to support reductions in housing consumption with
age.
Moreover, the age patterns of downsizing in housing consumption that occur are by and
large independent of the other demographic and work transitions (marital status, work status, and
kids at home status) in the sense that these estimated age patterns are about the same when all the
demographic and work transitions are excluded from the model. Thus, these age patterns lend
support to the most basic prediction of the life-cycle model that at sufficiently old ages total
consumption, of which housing is a very important part, will tend to decline. We return to this
point again in section 5 below.
Not only is higher household income associated with higher mobility at older ages it also is
associated, particularly in Britain, with a reduced likelihood of reducing the size of the dwelling
once one does move. Given the general desire to downsize at older ages, families in their present
houses have more housing that they really need at this stage of their lives. Not downsizing puts
the load on other forms of non- housing consumption to fall. Essentially the amenities of a ‘too
large’ house (family memories, associations with old neighbors etc) can be thought of as a luxury
good, which the more well- to- do are more able to afford.

28

In the US, there is limited evidence of a net impact of education on the size of the house
with some tendency for less educated British households to downsize more, even conditional on
their lower incomes. Increases in the value of the initial owned home tends to lead to a larger
decrease in the size of the dwelling suggesting that when a lot of resources are tied up in the
house, there is a greater tendency to downsize at older ages. The same is true when one has a lot
of equity in the home although this effect is only found in Britain at the ten year horizon.
In the United States, consistent with the theory outlined above, living in a more price
volatile area does encourage additional downsizing among those who do move. There appears to
be little effect in Britain although one obtains the expected negative point estimate of the effect at
the ten year horizon, albeit only with a t-value of 1.5.
4.3 The Change in the Number of Rooms—Full Sample
In the previous two sections, we estimated separate models for the probability of changing
residences at older ages and the change in the number of moves conditioned on being a mover.
The advantage of the two part model is that we can more easily detect whether variables have
differential effects on mobility and the consequences of that mobility for housing consumption.
We have already seen that in a number of cases the estimated effects are even of different sign. In
this section, we ignore that separation by estimating the effect of co-variates on the changing
number of rooms over the full sample of respondents. Since most people in fact do not move at
all at older ages, these estimated effects will of course be necessarily smaller.
Not surprisingly, the estimated impacts of demographic variables resemble those estimated
over the mover sample but at much diminished magnitude. The size of these demographic
associated with family related transitions tends to increase with the time duration of the window
in which a move can take place. In both countries, the transition from married to single is
associated with a smaller dwelling, while the reverse is true when people change from the single
life to a married one. Two differences between the two countries in the impact of the

29

demographic transitions are first that widowhood has no impact on the size of the house in Britain
while it tends to reduce the number of rooms in the US. Second, the transitions associated with
children appear to have no effect in Britain but kids leaving home do promote some downsizing
in the US. The only consistent impact of work transitions on the size of the dwelling in either
country is that the transition from work to no work (presumably during these ages mostly
retirement) leads to a smaller house.
Higher incomes strongly discourage downsizing in both countries with somewhat larger
estimated impacts in Britain. This implies that the increase in probability of moving is offset the
fact the move is less likely to reduce the size of the dwelling. Across the full sample, higher home
values encourage downsizing in the US but there is no effect in Britain. Home equity appears to
have little impact in either country. Once again the estimated patterns with age indicate that
housing consumption does decline with age, a decline that cannot be explained by the other
demographic and work transitions included in these models. These adjusted age patterns of
downsizing appear to be larger in the US than they are in Britain. On net, higher housing price
volatility encourages downsizing in US with statistically significant effects in Britain.

4.4 Changes in House Price
In addition to the number of rooms, the other dimension of housing consumption that we
can measure in both countries is the change in the value of the house among those who move.
By necessity, the sample over which these models are estimated are homeowners who moved but
who remained home owners. These models are presented in Tables 14.a (for the US) and 14.b
(for Britain). In order to control for any state or region wide capital gains in housing, these
models include two additional variables that are not in the change in rooms equation. The first is
the percent change in the real price of housing in the state of origin over the horizon used in the
regression (measured as the delta in the geometric means) and the second is whether or not one
changed state of residence when a move took place. Not surprisingly, individual level changes in

30

house values when people move are positively correlated with area wide real housing price
changes.
A useful comparison is to compare the results for the two dimensions of downsizingchange in number of rooms amongst movers (Table 12) and change in home price (Table 14).
Taking into account that sample sizes are much smaller in the model for the change in ln home
value specification the results for the US are generally similar but statistically weaker than for the
change in number of rooms. In particular, becoming single or having the final child leave home,
and more generally reductions in the number of people living in the household, are all associated
with a move to a less expensive home. There is little association of the value of the home with
any of the work transitions. Most important, volatility at baseline has the expected negative
coefficient in both the change in rooms and change in ln home value models but it is less
statistically significant in the home value specification. Perhaps, the biggest difference is that
income effects are much weaker in the change in home value model in the US. If anything the
results in Britain are weaker still where we encounter a lack of precision on our estimates of the
volatility terms and weaker income effects than in the model for the change in rooms.

4.5 Reducing price volatility

We have argued that, from an exposure to house price risk point of view, one alternative
to downsizing is to protect your assets in housing by moving to a less price volatile housing area.
Tables 15.a and 15.b model the change in housing price volatility among movers for the US and
Britain respectively. The outcome variable is measured as current housing price volatility minus
volatility in the new location, so that positive values imply a movement to a less housing price
volatile area. The same set of variables that entered the room downsizing model are included in
this model for escaping housing price volatility. Examining first table 15.b, we can see
immediately why it is so difficult to obtain an effect for housing price volatility in Britain. Given

31

the short time span over which models are estimated there, there is a very strong time trend in
volatility that dominates everything else included in the model. Conditional on this trend, (where
price volatility is increasing over time), there are little remaining systematic associations with
price volatility in Britain.
Given the longer number of years available for analysis coupled with more systematic
and larger differences between the volatile and less volatile areas, more interesting results were
obtained for the US model summarized in Table 15.a. A positive coefficient in these models
indicates that a variable is associated with moving to an even less price volatile area. To begin
with we see that many of the demographic transition variables associated with other forms of
downsizing are also important here. Most importantly, the transition of the last child leaving
home is associated with a greater tendency to move to a less housing price volatile area, and those
families whose children have already left home (the kids-no kids group) are also more likely to
search out a less price volatile area than those whose children remain in the home Once again, we
interpret this as a lagged effect of children leaving home prior to the baseline year since the
subsequent decision to relocate may not be instantaneous. Second, those households who either
are retired or who become retired are also likely to reduce the housing volatility associated with
the place where they decide to reside by more.
In contrast to some of the other measures, however, we do not find significant effects of
changes in marital status or widowhood, even over the longest time-period horizons. Finally, we
find contrasting education and income effects that are somewhat hard to interpret—conditional on
income, the more educated are less likely to reduce their house price volatility which is somewhat
of a puzzle, although the effect of income would be to offset this unconditionally, since those
with higher incomes tend to reduce their house price volatility by more. Since the age coefficients
tend to become less positive after age groups 55-59 and 60-64, the tendency to seek out places in
less volatile areas peaks in that age group.

32

5. Consumption Trajectories at Older Ages
One of the more hotly debated issues regarding life-cycle patterns of consumption with age
concerns whether households reduce their consumption at older ages. The importance of the
debate stems in part from the fact that it is a basic implication of the life-cycle model that such
consumption declines should occur in part due to rising rates of age specific mortality at older
ages. There are of course other reasons for consumption to fall with age particularly related to the
shrinking of households as children leave home and widowhood becomes more common. Thus,
the question is ask is whether consumption declines in addition to any changes induced by a set of
demographic changes producing smaller households and the decision to retire from the labor
force. Housing is an important component of total consumption and is believed to one of the
resistant to any downward changes. Thus, we argue that evidence showing a downward path of
housing consumption adds important evidence to this debate.
To provide such evidence, Figure 2.a plots the change in the number of rooms across age
bands that is estimated in the models for movers in Table 12.a and Table 12.b. Figure 2.b
provides similar plots except in this case the sample consists of all households whether or not
they change residence (i.e. the models estimated in Table 13.a and Table 13.b).For the purposes
of these plots, we used the models estimated over the five year horizon. The declines in housing
consumption documented in this section would be even larger if we used instead estimates
obtained from the ten year horizon. For both Figures 2.a and 2.b, we plot the estimated age
trajectories obtained whilst controlling for other transitions between waves (i.e. the models in
Tables 12 and 13 respectively), and also the trajectories estimated from a more restricted model
with the demographic and employment status transition variables excluded. In each country the
changes are normalized around the value for the 50-54 age group in the models without any
controls for demographic and work transitions.

33

Figure 2.a demonstrates that there exists in both countries a clear decline in housing
consumption (as measured by the change in the number of rooms) for movers, a decline that
appears to accelerate after age 65. Except for very old ages (ages 75 and older) this decrease in
housing consumption appears to be roughly similar in both countries. After age 75, the decrease
in the number of rooms is clearly larger in the United States presumably reflecting the decline in
the number of rooms associated with widowhood in the US and the absence of any such
association in Britain. These declines in housing consumption are not trivial- about one room in
the US and a half a room in Britain.
If we control for the other demographic and work transitions and all other covariates
included in the models in Tables 12.a and 12.b, the age patterns are very much the same
indicating declining housing consumption with age in both countries of about the same order of
magnitude. This indicates that the age patterns of declining housing consumption that we
document are not the result of either work or family transitions that are associated with aging.
The age patterns that are plotted in Figure 2.b for all households (independent of whether
they move or not over the five year horizon) dramatize a much larger difference between the two
countries. In particular, the decline in housing consumption with age across this more relevant
sample of all households is clearly much larger in the US than it is in Britain. The decline in
number of rooms with age is a little less than half a room in the US and about one twentieth of a
room in Britain. The principal reason for the differences between Figures 2.a and 2.b is that
households are much less mobile in Britain than in the US.
Our results indicate that housing consumption appears to decline with age in the US, even
after controlling for the other demographic and work transitions associated with age that would
normally produce such a decline. No such fall in housing consumption is found in Britain, largely
because British households are much more likely to stay in their original residence. The important
question that cannot be answered with data on housing alone is whether these results indicate a
more general tendency of less reduction in total household consumption in Britain compared to

34

the US at older ages. The alternative possibility is that the British adjust their non-housing
consumption downward more than American households do so that the patterns of total
household consumption with age are similar.
There may of course be other transitions, not controlled for in our analysis, driving the
downwards trajectories observed . The principal candidates for transitions that are correlated with
age and not accounted for in our models would be health related. Health conditions are not
measured well in either the PSID or the BHPS and we will consider them instead in future work
that uses the HRS and ELSA panels. Declines in health in old age are of course closely related to
the principal factor (rising mortality risk) emphasized in life-cycle models that produces the
decline in consumption so that it may be difficult to disentangle these effects in practice.

Conclusions
In this paper, we examined and modeled several types of housing transitions of the
elderly in two countries—Britain and the United States. One important form of these transitions
involves downsizing of housing consumption, the importance of which among older households
is still debated. We find that on balance—looking over a number of dimensions over a number of
transition intervals - downsizing is an important part of life for many older households in both
countries. For example over a decade, almost one in every three American home owners who
were at least fifty years old moved out of an their originally owned home. And mobility is much
higher in both countries (and in particular in the US) amongst renters. Moreover when they do
move we find that on average, households in both countries tend to downsize their housing
consumption. This downsizing takes multiple forms, including reductions in the number of rooms
per dwelling and the value of the home. There is also evidence that this downsizing is greater
when house price volatility is greater and in addition, that American households also try to escape

35

housing price volatility by moving to places that are experience significantly less housing price
volatility.
Our comparative evidence in the descriptive tables in Section 3 also suggests that there is
less evidence of downsizing in Britain than in the US, although a note of caution is appropriate
here because we have a considerably smaller samples and a different (and shorter) time period in
Britain. Nevertheless, given differences in house price volatility across the countries this is a
result that is, on the surface, contrary to the predictions of our simple theoretical discussion.
Looking within country, however, we find the expected positive correlation between volatility
and downsizing (although this correlation is weaker in Britain where we have less variation in
volatility to exploit). This in turn suggests that other factors must account for the differences in
the average levels of downsizing across the two countries. Possible candidates would include the
role of lower mobility in general in Britain. Whilst this is only an incomplete explanation since
mobility is itself an outcome measure and one indicator of downsizing, if households are moving
less often (and their children and grandchildren are also less likely to move) then there will be
less downsizing to the extent that the number of rooms and a reduction in house value only
change on moving.
Hence, other explanations might lie in transactions costs associated with moving in
Britain (where stamp duties are levied on house sales and the fixed costs associated with house
sales are both high and somewhat uncertain), the nature of bequests and inheritance tax bases and
the role of housing wealth in other economic institutions such as the means test for long-term
care. However, such mechanisms are unlikely to be the full explanation since mobility in Britain
is particularly low amongst renters. In addition, to the extent that retirement related mobility
yields movements outside Britain—to Spain and France, as opposed to Florida and Arizona, for
example - such transitions are not captured in our data although the empirical importance of such
transitions in Britain is still likely to be relatively limited. Finally, it is certainly the case that even

36

in the least volatile regions of Britain there is still considerable volatility so the possibility of
avoiding house price volatility altogether is somewhat limited. Such explanations should be
considered as topics for future research.
