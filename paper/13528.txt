Employer Health Insurance Mandates and the Risk of Unemployment
Katherine Baicker and Helen Levy
NBER Working Paper No. 13528
October 2007
JEL No. I1,J01
ABSTRACT
Employer health insurance mandates form the basis of many health care reform proposals. Proponents
make the case that they will increase insurance, while opponents raise the concern that low-wage workers
will see offsetting reductions in their wages and that in the presence of minimum wage laws some
of the lowest wage workers will become unemployed. We construct an estimate of the number of
workers whose wages are so close to the minimum wage that they cannot be lowered to absorb the
cost of health insurance, using detailed data on wages, health insurance, and demographics from the
Current Population Survey. We find that 33 percent of uninsured workers earn within $3 of the minimum
wage, putting them at risk of unemployment if their employers were required to offer insurance. Assuming
an elasticity of employment with respect to minimum wage increase of -0.10, we estimate that 0.2
percent of all full-time workers and 1.4 percent of uninsured full-time workers would lose their jobs
because of a health insurance mandate. Workers who would lose their jobs are disproportionately likely
to be high school dropouts, minority, and female. This risk of unemployment should be a crucial component
in the evaluation of both the effectiveness and distributional implications of these policies relative
to alternatives such as tax credits, Medicaid expansions, and individual mandates, and their broader
effects on the well-being of low-wage workers.

INTRODUCTION
Employer health insurance mandates form the basis of many health care reform
proposals. Democratic Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton, John Edwards and Barack
Obama have all proposed reforms that include pay-or-play mandates. Individual states
are contemplating these mandates as well. In California, for example, the state legislature
passed a law requiring employers above a certain size to provide a specified package of
health benefits for their workers. California voters narrowly overturned the measure
(“Proposition 72”) in 2004, but Governor Schwarzenegger recently unveiled a new plan
to expand insurance coverage that requires employer contributions. Oregon and
Washington enacted mandates that were later repealed. Hawaii implemented an employer
mandate in 1974. The recent reform in Massachusetts, which combines an individual
mandate, employer requirements, redirection of Medicaid funds, and the creation of a
new insurance pooling mechanism, has garnered much attention and may spur similar
reforms in other states.
The proponents of these measures make the case that they will increase insurance
coverage while maintaining the role of the market in generating competition and
efficiency in health insurance offerings. Opponents raise the concern that low-income
workers will see offsetting reductions in their wages and that in the presence of minimum
wage laws some of the lowest wage workers will become unemployed. Academics and
the popular press alike cite increased health insurance costs as one of the causes of recent
increases in unemployment (Porter, 2004). Estimates of the potential job loss from the
mandates included in the failed Clinton health care proposal ranged from 600,000 to
more than 2,000,000.

1

To determine how important the potential job loss from employer mandates is, we
need to know how many workers are likely to be affected. Several factors affect the
degree to which employer mandates will cause unemployment. First, what is the likely
cost of the mandated health insurance? This clearly depends on the specifics of the
mandated coverage.1 Second, how much of an increase in the cost of employing workers
is borne by employees in the form of reduced wages? There is substantial evidence that
the cost of health insurance mandates will be shifted to employees, resulting in lower
wages.2

Third, how many workers not currently covered by employer-sponsored

insurance are so close to the minimum wage that their wages cannot be lowered enough
to offset the cost of the new mandate? We focus on the last question. This paper provides
an estimate of how big the pool of workers at risk of unemployment is likely to be and
what characteristics they are likely to have, taking into account minimum wage laws and
patterns of employer health insurance offering and coverage.
We construct an estimate of the number of workers whose wages are so low that
they cannot be lowered to absorb the cost of health insurance, using detailed data on
wages, health insurance, and demographics from the Current Population Survey. We
characterize the population of workers at risk in terms of their socio-demographic
characteristics (age, race, gender, education, family structure), and industry of
employment.

We find that 33 percent of uninsured workers earn within $3 of the

costs and benefits of California’s law depend crucially on the subsidy for low-income workers, the
generosity of the plan required to fulfill the “play-or-pay” requirements, etc. See also Zedlewski et al,

minimum wage, putting them at substantial risk of unemployment if their employers were
required to offer insurance. These workers are disproportionately likely to be high school
dropouts or racial minorities. Understanding which workers these laws are likely to
affect should play an important role in the assessment of the effect of employer mandates
on the level and distribution of employment and insurance coverage.

BACKGROUND
The estimated impact of an employer health insurance mandate on insurance
coverage and employment depends on two sets of factors: (1) the specifics of the mandate
and (2) what one assumes about the dynamics of wages, fringe benefits, and employment.
Specific mandate proposals vary widely from state to state.3

Most include

exemptions for smaller firms (e.g. those with fewer than 20 employees in California) and
for employees with few hours (e.g. fewer than 20 hours per week in Hawaii or 100 hours
per month in California). Most include minimum employer contributions (such as 80
percent of premiums in California or 75 percent for employees in Oregon) and minimum
coverage requirements (benchmarked to other plans offered in the state in Hawaii;
including prescription drugs and preventive care in California). Three of these features
are likely to be particularly important for the analysis of any particular mandate. First,
which employers and employees are affected? Any exemptions, such as those for small
firms or part-time workers, will dilute both the positive and negative effects of a mandate.
Second, what is the marginal cost of the newly mandated benefits, both in terms of
specific benefits and in terms of lost flexibility for employers? A mandate can specify a

mandate in order to estimate the proposal’s cost.

3

generous benefits package that all employers must provide (thus increasing costs for
some employers already providing insurance) or it can require minimal coverage that
affects only employers who do not already provide insurance. Third, what fraction of
these costs must nominally be borne by the employer? When nominal wage rigidities
prevent accommodation of increased costs through reduced wages, the statutory
incidence may have a substantial effect. Policies that require firms to offer insurance but
not pay for it would like have little effect on rates of coverage because uninsured workers
do not appear to be very responsive to the availability of benefits unless they are very
heavily subsidized (Chernew, Frick and McLaughlin, 1997; for a review of the recent
literature on price elasticities of demand for health insurance among uninsured workers,
see Gruber and Washington, 2003).4
The second set of issues – what assumptions one maintains about the dynamics of
wages, fringe benefits, and employment – comes into play when a significant share of the
cost of the newly mandated health benefits falls on employers. There is a consensus
among most economists that these costs, like the cost of any fringe benefit that workers
value, will be passed on to workers in the form of reduced wages whenever possible (see
Gruber and Krueger, 1991; Gruber, 1994; Fishback and Kantor, 1995; Olson, 2002). The
implication of this is that when an insurance mandate accomplishes its stated goal of
extending coverage to a previously uninsured worker, that worker will also experience a
reduction in her wage or the growth of her wage relative to what would have happened
otherwise. In the best-case scenario, the worker’s wage will be sufficiently high to

4

If workers are required to take up the insurance, the degree to which workers value the benefits and the
elasticity of labor supply and demand would determine the ultimate effect on wages (and the “incidence”
of the mandate) – as discussed below. See Summers (1989) for a discussion of how worker valuation
affects the incidence of mandated benefits.

4

absorb the entire cost of the benefit, and the mandate will have changed the composition
of compensation (less wages, more benefits) but not the total value of compensation.
The problem arises when the worker’s wage is not high enough to absorb this cost
without bumping into the minimum wage. When this is the case, the insurance mandate
has the same effect on employment as an increase in the minimum wage. Suppose, for
example, that an uninsured worker earning the minimum wage becomes subject to an
insurance mandate that requires the employer to provide benefits that cost $1 per hour
worked. Since there is no scope to reduce wages, the hourly cost of employing the
worker is now the minimum wage plus $1. Economists have long believed that this is
likely to result in lower employment, as employers substitute machines for workers when
workers become more expensive. The size of this “elasticity” of employment with
respect to the minimum wage has been the subject of considerable recent controversy:
there is little consensus on the magnitude of the unemployment effect associated with an
increase in the minimum wage (see Brown, 1999, for a review). Regardless of one’s
beliefs about the employment effect of minimum wage increases, however, the
employment effect of an employer health insurance mandate that increases employer
costs ought to be the same as the effect of a change in the minimum wage. In the analysis
that follows, we present estimates of the population at risk of being affected by the
imposition of employer mandates, to which different estimates of the elasticity of
employment with respect to changes in the minimum wage can be applied. Our analysis
shows how many uninsured workers are within different ranges of the minimum wage
(such as within $3), so that readers can consider mandates that impose different levels of

5

cost on employers and a range of estimates of the effect of changes in the minimum wage
on employment.

DATA AND METHODS
The primary data for analysis come from the Current Population Survey (CPS),
conducted annually by the Bureau of the Census. The CPS collects information from
about 50,000 households each month about household composition, socio-demographic
characteristics, earnings, and employment in eight different monthly surveys over the
course of sixteen months. Each month’s survey provides detailed demographic data such
as age, race, education, marital status, and family composition of respondents. The March
survey in each year also collects information about health insurance coverage. We
combine these variables with information provided by respondents about their labor force
status, whether or not they are paid hourly, usual hours worked, and wages in an exit
(“outgoing rotation”) interview.5 We use data from 2000 to 2006, the most recent CPS
survey available. We restrict our sample to respondents age 22 to 65.
To this data we add information on the minimum wage, which varies by state and
over time (see Nelson, Nelson and Fizpatrick, and Fitzpatrick, various years, for details
of state law changes, also shown in Appendix Table A1). While the federal minimum
wage was $5.15 throughout our study period, several states enacted minimum wages that
were higher than the federal minimum, so workers and employers in these states faced a
5

We are able to match just over 70 percent of March respondents to their corresponding exit (“outgoing
rotation”) interview. Reasons for failing to find a respondents across months include household mobility,
nonresponses, and noise in the identifiers. There is also a known decline in match quality following the
expansion of the CPS sample size in 2002 (driven in part by the way that household identifiers were
assigned to the new sample). We use the standard household and person identifiers to match across
months, and then screen for match quality using respondent demographics (such as age and gender), based
on methodology outlined in Madrian and Lefgren (2000). About 5.1% of observed “matches” appear to be
false, and these observations are dropped.

higher minimum wage. We then compare workers’ wages to the minimum wage in effect
in January in their state and year (which corresponds best with the period from which
respondents in the CPS report their wages).
We also use information on health insurance premiums by state, year, and policy
type (family or single) collected by the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey for 1999 to
2005. We merge this data with the individual observations from the CPS for those years
(using the previous year’s survey to most closely match the timing of the CPS
questionnaire) to impute a health insurance premium for each observation, attributing
family policy premiums to those with a spouse or children and single policy premiums to
those without.6 We deflate all dollar amounts to year 2006 dollars using the CPI.
Together, these data allow us to estimate both the likely effect of different
employer mandates on wages and employment, as well as the distributional implications
for workers with different characteristics. In the analysis that follows, we aggregate data
from the CPS across years, and report workers’ insurance status, wages relative to the
minimum wage, and various demographic characteristics such as age, race, marital status,
and education.

We use the weights provided in the CPS so that the numbers and

proportions we report are representative of the full-time private sector workforce as a
whole. See the Appendix Tables that follow for more detail.

RESULTS
We use these data to estimate which workers would be at risk of unemployment
with the imposition of employer mandates. We present data on the health insurance and

(1986) presents evidence that people actually respond to these questions as if they were reporting their
coverage at the time of the survey.

wage distribution of all workers, as well as different demographic subgroups, focusing in
particular on workers with wages close to the minimum wage since it is these workers
whose wages may have the least flexibility to be lowered in response to mandates that
make employing them more costly, and thus may be most likely to face adverse
employment consequences.7 We focus our analysis on workers employed more than 20
hours per week, as those with fewer hours are likely to be exempt from employer
mandates.8 Much more detailed data are shown in the Appendix Tables that follow.

Workers at Risk
More than 15 percent of private sector workers employed more than 20 hours a
week (whom we call “full time”) are currently uninsured. Note that our estimate of
uninsured workers includes those who decline insurance offered to them by their
employers, but does not include workers who get insurance from a source other than their
own employer.9

7

While hourly workers may be more susceptible to binding minimum wages than salaried workers,
minimum wage laws apply to almost all salaried workers as well. We impute an hourly wage for those
workers on salary using the usual hours worked per week and weekly wages from the CPS. Workers paid
hourly are much more likely to be close to the minimum wage than those paid on salary, but we include
both in our analysis.
8
Many proposed mandates only apply to full-time workers. Employers might thus have the incentive to
substitute away from full-time employees towards part-time employees. We ignore these dynamics. We
are also implicitly assuming here that wages adjust independently of whether workers would have taken up
insurance or not – insofar as there is no mechanism for employers to know ahead of time (when offering a
wage and insurance package) whether a worker is going to take up that coverage or not.
9
Implicitly, we are assuming that the wages of workers who turned down have not already adjusted
downward by the cost of the insurance that they declined. Analysis of the February Contingent Work
Supplements to the Current Population Survey in 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001 and 2005 shows that about onequarter of uninsured workers were offered insurance. We also assume that workers with coverage from
another source, which is typically a spouse’s employer-sponsored policy, would not be affected by
mandates.

Who are these uninsured workers? They are more than three times as likely to be highschool drop-outs as insured workers, and twice as likely to be from a minority racial or
ethnic group. They are 50 percent more likely to be under age 35 and to be unmarried.
They are almost twice as likely to be single parents.

Uninsured workers are thus demographically quite different from insured workers.
Several of these characteristics make them economically vulnerable – and also make
them the target population for policies intended to expand health insurance coverage.
Many of the employer mandates being considered by different states exempt
small firms. More than 55 percent of all uninsured workers are employed in firms with
more than 25 employees (compared to more 80 percent of insured workers) – which

9

means that they would be covered by many proposed mandates.10 Of course, mandates
that cover only firms above this size would have commensurately smaller effects both on
insurance coverage and on the risk of decreasing employment than proposals without
such limitations.

Benchmark Insurance Costs
How likely these uninsured workers are to face unemployment depends on
whether the minimum wage is binding – that is, if the hourly cost per worker of newly
mandated health insurance is greater than the gap between the worker’s wage and the
minimum wage.

While a more detailed calculation requires knowledge of (or

assumptions about) workers’ family structure, health status, the elasticity of labor supply
and demand, workers’ valuation of health insurance benefits, long-run labor market
dynamics (such as substitution towards part-time employees) and the like, we calculate
several informative back-of-the-envelope benchmarks using aggregate insurance costs.
The average annual premium for employer-sponsored health insurance in our data was
approximately $9,046 for family coverage and $3,429 for single coverage (for the period

10

It is not clear how accurate employees’ reports of their establishment size are.

10

2000-2006, expressed in 2006 dollars), for an average hourly premium of $3.66 for a fulltime worker.11 If employers were required to pay 80% of premiums, the average hourly
wage for this group of workers would thus have to decrease by about $3 to absorb fully
the cost of providing the average health insurance package. Here, clearly, the costs
would be different if the mandated insurance coverage were more or less generous than
the typical plan already provided to most workers or if workers were required to pay
more of the premium directly.
We also calculate a more sophisticated benchmark based on the insurance cost
facing individual workers, rather than a broad average. We impute the insurance cost for
each worker based on state of residence, year, and family structure, divide that number by
2,000 to generate an average hourly cost of insurance, and compare the difference
between hourly wages and the minimum wage to that hourly insurance cost.

The Role of the Minimum Wage
A large fraction of uninsured workers earn little more than the minimum wage.
Insurance costs potentially represent an enormous increase in the minimum compensation
for this group of workers.

The federal minimum wage is $5.15, and the average

11

These data are consistent with other survey results on insurance costs, suggesting that our algorithm for
assigning premiums in our sample is representative. For example, the Kaiser/HRET survey reported
average employer premiums in 2006 of $11,500 for family policies and $4,200 for single policies, while in
our CPS/MEPS sample the average premium in 2006 was $10,700 for family policies and 4,000 for single
policies.

11

minimum wage in our sample (taking into account state minimums that are sometimes
higher) is $5.98 – so the benchmark cost of $3 represents 50 percent of the effective
minimum wage.12 There is clearly a great deal of disagreement about the effect of
minimum wages on employment, but even under relatively conservative elasticity
estimates this could result in significant effects on minimum wage workers.
Uninsured workers earning within $3 of the minimum wage represent 5 percent of
the workforce, and a third of all uninsured workers. (Using the more sophisticated
benchmark based on individual insurance costs yields answers very similar to the $3
benchmark, both of which are reported in the Appendix Tables.)

Figure 1 shows a more detailed distribution of the hourly wages of uninsured workers
relative to the minimum wage.

12

On average, wages represent about 70 percent of compensation in the private sector, with health insurance
costs accounting for an addition 7 percent, other voluntary fringe benefits accounting for 14 percent, and
legally required benefits (such as Social Security) accounting for the remaining 9 percent (Department of
Labor 2007). In theory, then, employers might respond to insurance mandates by reducing other fringe
benefits. Low-wage workers are less likely than the typical worker to have these other benefits, however
(Schwabisch 2004), so it is unclear in practice how much of a buffer other benefits provide.

The gap between a worker's wage and the minimum wage

Thus, while the overall fraction of private sector workers who are “at risk” is
moderate, since only 5 percent of all workers are uninsured workers earning within $3 of
the minimum wage, a potentially very large fraction of the group supposedly targeted for
help by employer mandates might in fact be hurt, since 33 percent of uninsured workers
earn within $3 of the minimum wage. So, of the roughly 114 million U.S. private sector
workers, 105 million of whom work more than 20 hours per week, 16 million are
uninsured, and more than 5 million of those earn within $3 of the minimum wage.13
As Table 2 suggested, low-skilled workers are more likely to be uninsured.
Figure 2 shows this wage distribution for workers with different levels of education.
Workers with less than a high school degree are significantly more likely to have
earnings close to the minimum wage.

Bureau of Labor Statistics series CES0500000001 (total private employment) is 113,753,000 in March

The gap between a worker's wage and the minimum wage

Thus, among the uninsured, those with the least education face the highest risk of losing
their jobs under employer mandates. The same is true for nonwhites, those under age 35,
single parents, and women (as seen in Appendix Table A4).

Potential Job Loss
How many of those workers are likely to lose their jobs? We calculate an
approximate answer to this question in the following way.

First, we compare the

individual-specific hourly insurance costs described above to the cushion between an
uninsured worker’s wage and the minimum wage. If a worker’s wage is sufficiently high
that it can adjust downward by the full cost of insurance without hitting the minimum
wage, we assume this worker is not at risk of losing her job. If, however, the minimum
wage constraint binds, we calculate the percentage increase in total compensation implied

14

by the health insurance mandate. For example, if a worker earning $6 per hour is
mandated to have health insurance costing the firm $2 per hour, we assume that her wage
will adjust downward by 85 cents to the minimum wage of $5.15.

However, the

remaining $1.15 of the cost of the mandate cannot be absorbed by reducing wages and
increases her total compensation to $7.15 – an increase in compensation of almost 20
percent ($1.15/$6.00 = 0.19). Assuming an employment elasticity with respect to the
minimum wage of -0.1, meaning that a ten percent increase in the minimum wage would
lead to a one percent reduction in employment, this worker has a two percent chance of
losing her job.14 Performing a similar calculation for all the workers in our sample
suggests that about 224,000 workers would lose jobs as a result of a mandate with these
costs.

More than 60 percent of these workers would be racial or ethnic minorities and

about one-third would have less than a high school education. The burden of the mandate
would thus fall disproportionately on these groups since, for example, racial and ethnic
minorities are only 30 percent of the workforce in this sample.

This is a relatively conservative estimate of the sensitivity of employment to minimum wage laws. See
Brown (1999) for a review of the wider range of estimates of this elasticity.

15

To the extent that mandates impose additional costs on firms (such as reduced
flexibility or more generous coverage than they were already offering), these figures
represent a lower bound on the increase in unemployment likely to result from such
mandates. As noted above, if mandates apply only to some workers this will dilute both
the positive and negative effects of a mandate. For example, establishments with fewer
than 25 workers employ 44 percent of uninsured workers (Table 3); if these small
employers were exempted from a mandate, our estimate of job loss would drop to about
45 percent of the number above.

Regional Variation
These results are not confined to any particular area of the country. As Appendix
Table 7 shows, the Northeast, Midwest, South, and West have very similar fractions of
workers at risk for unemployment. Looking at individual states shows that there is local
variation in this at-risk pool, however (although sample size limits our ability to compare
individual states).

Individual states should be more concerned with employment effects of their own
minimum wage laws and health insurance mandates than the federal government, since

16

firms and jobs may move across state lines if nearby states place fewer constraints on
employers.

DISCUSSION
Understanding the labor market consequences of employer mandates is a key
component in evaluating their effectiveness relative to other policies such as tax credits,
Medicaid expansions, and individual mandates. Several studies have analyzed the effect
of different versions of employer mandates on insurance premiums and on workers’
wages. This study contributes an important missing piece to the analysis: how large is
the potential risk of unemployment? Our analysis suggests that one third of the targeted
population of uninsured workers have hourly wages close enough to the minimum wage
that employers will not be able to lower their wages enough to accommodate fully the
increase in compensation costs that employer mandates would impose. These workers,
who tend to be disproportionately low-education, minority, and female, thus face a risk of
unemployment.

This risk of unemployment should be a crucial component in the

evaluation of both the effectiveness of these policies in reducing the number of uninsured
and their broader effects on the well-being of low-wage workers.
