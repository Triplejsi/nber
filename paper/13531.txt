Export Dynamics in Colombia: Firm-Level Evidence
Jonathan Eaton, Marcela Eslava, Maurice Kugler , and James Tybout
NBER Working Paper No. 13531
October 2007
JEL No. F10
ABSTRACT
Using transactions-level customs data from Colombia, we study firm-specific export patterns over
the period 1996-2005. Our data allow us to track firms' entry and exit into and out of individual destination
markets, as well as their revenues from selling there. We find that, in a typical year, nearly half of
all Colombian exporters were not exporters in the previous year. These new exporters tend to be extremely
small in terms of their overall contribution to export revenues, and most do not continue exporting
in the following year. Hence export sales are dominated by a small number of very large and stable
exporters. Nonetheless, out of each cohort of new exporters, a fraction of firms go on to expand their
foreign sales very rapidly, and over the period of less than a decade, these successful new exporters
account for almost half of total export expansion. Finally, we find that new exporters begin in a single
foreign market and, if they survive, gradually expand into additional destinations. The geographic
expansion paths they follow, and their likelihood of survival as exporters, depend on their initial destination
market.

Introduction

Research in international trade, both theoretical and quantitative, is increasingly focussed
on the role of …rm heterogeneity in shaping trade ‡ows. One strand of the literature shows
how …rm-speci…c productivity shocks a¤ect the mix of exporting …rms and their foreign sales
volumes (e.g., Clerides, Lach, and Tybout, 1998; Bernard and Jensen, 1999; Melitz, 2003;
Bernard, Eaton, Jensen, and Kortum, 2003; Das, Roberts, and Tybout, 2007; Bernard, Jensen,
Reading, and Schott, 2007). These studies provide insight into why some producers export and
others do not, and the role of market entry costs in shaping export dynamics. Another strand
of the literature documents and interprets the relationship between …rms’productivity levels
and the collection of foreign markets that they serve (Eaton, Kortum, and Kramarz, 2004 and
2007). These papers …nd that most exporting …rms sell to only one foreign market, with the
frequency of …rms’selling to multiple markets declining with the number of destinations. At
the same time, …rms selling to only a small number of markets tend to sell to the most popular
ones. Less popular markets are served by …rms that export very widely. These patterns are
consistent with the notion that …rms with relatively low marginal costs can pro…tably exploit
relatively more foreign markets.
While both strands of the literature have furthered our understanding of the relationships
between productivity distributions and trade ‡ows, the necessary data have not been available
to study both export dynamics and destination-speci…c ‡ows for the same set of producers.
Also, although several papers have examined the relationship between individual producer
decisions and aggregate export trajectories, they have done so only for selected manufacturing
industries (Roberts and Tybout, 1997b; Das, Roberts, and Tybout, 2007). This study exploits

comprehensive transactions-level trade data from Colombia to generate a new set of stylized
facts on both issues.
Our analysis proceeds in several steps. After reviewing patterns of aggregate exports across
destination countries and over time, we decompose export growth into two parts: changes in
sales volume among incumbent exporters (“the intensive margin”) and changes in the set
of exporting …rms (“the extensive margin”). Next, we track the behavior of “cohorts” of
exporters from their …rst year in foreign markets onward. Finally, we characterize …rms’
transition paths as they change the set of export markets that they serve.
Several key patterns emerge. First, in any one year, almost all export expansion or contraction comes from changes in sales by …rms that have been exporting for at least one year.
This dominance of existing …rms is despite the fact that one-third to one-half of all exporters
are new entrants in a typical year. These new …rms by and large do not add much to export
growth simply because (i) the majority do not last more than a year and (ii) their sales are
very small. Second, however, the new exporters who do survive their …rst year grow especially
rapidly for several years thereafter, and together account for about half of the total expansion
in merchandise trade over the course of a decade. An explanation for this pattern is that exporters and importers frequently experiment with small scale transactions, and while most of
these experiments fail, those that prove mutually pro…table quickly lead to larger shipments.
Third, as exporters add or drop markets, they appear to follow certain geographic patterns.
For example, those that begin by exporting to Latin American destinations are more likely
to add markets than those that begin by exporting to the United States. This pattern may
partly re‡ect the nature of the goods being shipped, but it may also mean that certain markets

2

are well-suited to serve as “testing grounds”for new exporters who wish to learn about their
foreign market potential.

Data

Our data set includes all export transactions by Colombian …rms between 1996 and 2005.
Each transaction is recorded separately, and we aggregate transactions by a given …rm to
obtain total exports by that …rm in each year. A transaction record includes the …rm’s tax
ID (which serves as a time-invariant identi…er), a product code, the value of the transaction
in US dollars, and the country of destination. Because we use the same data that are used
for o¢ cial statistics, the merchandise exports in our data set aggregate to within one percent
of total merchandise exports reported by the Colombian Bureau of Statistics (Departamento
Administrativo Nacional de Estadística or DANE).1
Before turning to the …rm-level data themselves, we set the stage by reviewing the aggregate movements in Colombian exports over the period we are considering. Figure 1 depicts
annual Colombian merchandise exports from 1996 through 2005 (in current US dollars) to
external markets. It also breaks out exports to several signi…cant destinations: (i) the United
States, (ii) the European Union, and (iii) Venezuela and Ecuador, Colombia’s contiguous
neighbors with active cross-border trade.2 Note that the …rst seven years exhibit alternating
1

The deviation is due to mistakes in the records of tax identi…ers. Since following …rms over time is

central to our analysis, our database includes only records of transactions in which the tax identi…er has the
appropriate format. Not satisfying this requirement is a clear indication that the …rm is not correctly identi…ed
in the record.
2

Colombia also shares borders with Brazil, Panama, and Peru, but the borders lie mostly in unpopulated

3

periods of modest growth and decline, with drops in 1998, 2001, and 2002. Growth picks up
again in 2003 and then accelerates in the most recent two years. These patterns are re‡ected
closely in exports to the United States, Colombia’s largest destination in terms of overall value.
Colombia’s exports to the European Union, on the other hand, experience a much longer and
more pronounced decline over the years 1999 through 2002, recovering to their 1997 level only
at the end of the period.3 Colombian exports to its neighbors have grown overall but have
been much more volatile than exports to other destinations, with sharp declines in 1999, 2002,
and 2003. These overall patterns should be kept in mind as we turn to the …rm level activity
underlying them.

Total Exports and the Number of Firms: The Cross
Section

With our …rm-level data we can decompose aggregate exports into (i) the number of …rms
selling and (ii) average sales per …rm. Denoting by Xn (t) aggregate Colombian exports to
market n in year t; by Nn (t) the number of …rms selling there, and by xn (t) average sales per
…rm we can write the identity:
ln Xn (t) = ln Nn (t) + ln xn (t):
jungle areas, so that cross-border trade is much less intense. Moreover, most economic activity in Colombia
takes place in the valleys between the various Andean mountain ranges and on the Caribbean coast. These
areas are contiguous with Venezuela and Ecuador, but not with the other neighbors.
3

European integration and the emergence of former Soviet states as new sources of imports probably

contributed to the sluggish growth of European demand for Colombian goods.

4

Figure 2 provides a quick sense of the contribution of the two terms on the right to the term
on the left by plotting Nn (t) against Xn (t): Each data point represents a speci…c destination
in a speci…c year. The relationship is clearly upward sloping, indicating that the extensive
margin (more …rms) plays an important role.
A regression of ln Nn (t) against ln Xn (t) provides a measure of the average contribution
of entry to changes in the value of exports. The implied margin is :54, meaning that, in
comparing two destination-years, a doubling of export volume re‡ects just over 50 percent
more …rms. An implication, of course, is that sales per …rm rise by slightly less than 50
percent.
A similar exercise is conducted by Eaton, Kortum, and Kramarz (2004), who relate the
total number of French exporters to the market size (rather than total exports as we use
here) of the destination for a 1986 cross-section. They …nd a margin of entry of just under
two-thirds. To the extent that total exports of a particular country are proportional to market
size (as implied by the standard gravity formulation) the result then implies that the number
of French exporters should rise with total French exports with the same elasticity. The lower
elasticity we …nd for Colombia seems to be related to the fact that many destinations are
served by just a few, frequently just one or two, Colombian …rms. Note in Figure 2 that the
relationship between the two margins becomes much tighter for destinations served by 10 or
more …rms. In the case of France, no market is served by fewer than sixty French exporters.
Note also in Figure 2 that many of the destinations with only one Colombian exporter
purchased rather large volumes, suggesting that larger, probably more established, exporters
tend to be those that explore new destinations. On the other hand, the destinations that

5

attract the most Colombian exporters tend to purchase relatively little per exporter. These
destinations may present Colombian exporters with relatively low entry-cost barriers and/or
a diversi…ed collection of potential buyers. Either characteristic would make them attractive
to new exporters who wish to try out foreign markets on a small scale. We will return to
consider these possibilities further below.

Decomposing Growth: Continuing Firms, Entry, and
Exit

Having seen the importance of the extensive margin in explaining cross-sectional variation,
we now ask how much it contributes to changes over time. We …rst look at how growth in
exports re‡ects the contributions of continuing …rms, entrants, and exiters using the identity:
XnCO (t) XnCO (t 1)

Here XnCO (t) denotes total Colombian exports to destination n in year t and xn (j; t) is exports
by …rm j to destination n in period t: The terms CNnt
respectively, the set of …rms that exported to n in t

represent,

…rms in the ENnt

1;t

and N EXnt

1;t

represent the number of

sets, respectively. The term xn (t

1) represents average

1:4

exports of a …rm to destination n in period t

The left-hand side of equation (1) measures the growth in exports between t

1 and t.

The expression on the …rst line of the right-hand side represents the contribution to growth
of pairwise continuing …rms, de…ned here as those that exported in both periods. It equals
the share of continuing …rms’exports over the two years times the growth in their sales.
The second and third lines measure the contributions of entry and exit, respectively, to
export growth. The contribution of entry is expressed as the sum of two terms: (i) the growth
in exports implied by the increase in the number of exporters if new …rms had the same average
sales as those of the average …rm in period t
entrants and those of the average …rm in t

1; and (ii) the di¤erence between exports of

1. The …rst term is thus gross percentage entry

in terms of numbers of …rms and the sum of the …rst and second is the total contribution of
entry to growth. Similarly, the contribution of exit is expressed as the sum of the contraction
that would have occurred if each exiting …rm had been as large as the average t

1 exporter,

and a term that corrects for the fact that exiting …rms are relatively small.
4

Note that we follow the convention of treating growth as the change between two dates divided by the

average level in the two dates rather than the change divided by the level in the earlier date. Bene…ts are that
(i) x percent growth followed by

x percent growth returns us to the same level and (ii) values close to zero

in the …rst year have a less extreme e¤ect on the growth rate.

4.1

Aggregate Growth

Table 1 presents the results of applying equation (1) to decompose aggregate export growth,
year by year. Cross-year averages of the growth components are presented in the last row.
Also, to highlight the cumulative e¤ects of entry and exit, the next-to-last row presents a
cross-decade application of the decomposition. This latter set of …gures treats all exporters
observed in 2005 but not in 1996 as entering …rms, all exporters observed in 1996 but not
2005 as exiting …rms, and exporters observed in both years as continuers.5
The calculations in this table pool all the destinations. The main line for each component
represents the contribution to growth itself by the corresponding term and the expression
in parentheses below is the percentage contribution to the total change. Similarly, Figure 3
shows year-to-year export growth disaggregated into the three basic components of equation
(1) for all destinations. In addition to the contributions of continuing …rms, entry, and exit,
it also shows the net e¤ect of entry and exit.
Table 1 and Figure 3 indicate that continuing …rms drive most of the year to year ‡uctuations, although much less so after 2001. Note, for instance, that in Figure 3 the lines for
total growth and growth by continuers are almost identical up to 2001. For later years, total
growth takes o¤, re‡ecting an increase in net entry. Looking at the cross-decade decomposition, however, net entry contributed to over a quarter of the growth in exports (26%, or 17.4
percentage points of growth, calculated from the next-to-last line in Table 1).
Breaking the net entry e¤ect for a typical year into its individual components, one …nds that
5

The bottom row of the table reports annual averages. Unlike the other rows the overall growth rate in the

…rst column does not relate exactly to the remaining components according to the identity above since some
of the individual terms enter nonadditively.

8

if entrants had exported as much per …rm as pairwise continuers, they would have generated
about 46 percentage points of total annual export growth, on average (last line of table 1).
But since their exports per …rm were smaller the net export growth from gross entry averaged
only 3.2 percentage points. Some algebra shows that behind these …gures is an average size
of entrants, relative to those of …rms selling the previous year, equal to 1

(42:2=45:4) = :066

or 6.6 percent.6 Similarly, exiting …rms would have reduced exports by 43.6 percentage points
per year if they had exported as much per …rm as a typical …rm the previous year. But
since their exports per …rm were smaller by factor of 5.5 percent, gross exit implied only 2.3
percentage points of export contraction.
The cross-decade version of the decomposition (next-to-last line of table 1) shows that the
cumulative e¤ects of entry and exit were nonetheless substantial. Gross entry contributed 47
percent (31.3 percentage points) of total growth, and would have implied 61.5 percentage
points of growth if entrants exported as much as the average …rm at the beginning of the
period. (A calculation like the one above indicates that by the end of this period these …rms
exported about half as much as the average …rm at the beginning.) Similarly, the gross exit
of …rms would have implied a contraction of exports of 53.9 percentage points if those …rms
exported as much as the average …rm of the beginning of the period. However, the average
sales of exiting …rms were about 25 percent of the beginning of period average, implying a net
contraction of exports due to gross exit of 13.9 percentage points.

In sum, 8% of the average year-to-year growth in exports is explained by year-to-year net
entry. This number is small despite vigorous turnover among exporters because …rms that
have just begun to export or are about to stop exporting typically sell relatively little. On
the other hand, as we further discuss in section 5 below, …rms that enter foreign markets and
survive more than a year are typically able to expand rapidly. Thus, net entry over the course
of the sample period accounts for one quarter of the cumulative total export expansion, while
gross entry explains about half of total growth. Below, we further explore and emphasize the
importance of gross entry for long run export growth.

4.2

Individual Destinations

Figure 4 shows annual averages of this decomposition for the ten most popular destination
markets (on a transaction basis, see the notes to the …gure for greater detail on the classi…cation of destinations). Note that exports to some countries, particularly the Dominican
Republic, grew phenomenally while, as discussed above, exports to the European Union languished. Furthermore, with the exception of Panama, where there was little growth but much
entry, high growth appears to be associated with more exporter turnover, as well as more net
entry. And, with the exception of Europe, continuing …rms explain a large part of the variation in growth rates across destinations. Thus, although markets are heterogeneous, some
general patterns explain the behavior of exports to most destinations. In particular, while net
entry contributes positively to export growth, pairwise continuers explain most of it.

4.3

Di¤erences in Size: Gibrat’s Law Fails

Gibrat’s Law holds that the growth rate of a …rm is independent of its size. To what extent does
Colombian export growth obey the law? To address this issue we next decompose the growth
rate of continuing …rms into quintile-speci…c components. More precisely, we decompose the
contribution of continuing exporters in equation (1) as:

quintile de…ned regardless of whether …rms went on to sell in period t or not). The …rst term
in parentheses is the share of quintile q in total sales (obviously declining in q). The second
is the growth rate of sales by that quintile.
Table 2 presents the quintile-speci…c growth rates that correspond to the right-hand side
component in the product above. Quintile 1 includes those …rms whose exports in year t

1

fell above the 80th percentile in that year, quintile 2 includes …rms between the 60th and
80th percentile, and so on. For comparison purposes, Table 2 also reports quintile-speci…c
growth rates inclusive of those …rms that exited in the following year, and quintile-speci…c
mean exports. Panel A does the analysis for total exports year by year while Panel B presents
annual averages taken over individual destinations.7 Panel C presents the decompositions for
7

In order to calculate quintiles we limited ourselves to destinations with at least …ve exporters.

11

the ten most popular destinations.
All three panels of table 3 imply a major departure from Gibrat’s Law: Sales growth
is systematically higher among …rms in the low-sales quintiles, even when exit is taken into
account. Remarkable is the huge growth in sales of continuing …rms in the …fth quintile. This
quintile is always the fastest growing. Nevertheless, because …rms in this quintile initially sell
so little, their contribution to overall growth is trivial. Sales of …rms in the …rst quintile for
each destination grow by less than the overall growth rates of continuing …rms. Even among
these larger exporters, taking into account exit substantially lowers overall growth.
One explanation for this di¤erential growth across quintiles is that …rms face increasing
resistance to foreign market penetration as their exports grow. Sustaining growth may be
di¢ cult because exporters encounter capacity constraints, because their foreign demand elasticities fall as they expand, or because the return per dollar expenditure on advertising drops
as their market penetration increases (as in Arkolakis, 2006).
Alternatively, it may be that new exporters go through a learning period during which
their buyers try them out on a very limited scale (Rauch and Watson, 2003). Buyers may be
learning about sellers’business practices and products, while sellers learn about the reliability
of their potential partners and the scope for future sales. Once this exploration process has
played out, …rms either terminate their exporting relationship or experience a surge in orders.8
Panel C of Table 2 allows us to investigate the distribution of sales across the di¤erent
destinations. We observe higher growth for …rms in the low-sales quintiles, compared with the
high-growth ones, for all destinations. However, there are some interesting di¤erences across
8

This process is analogous to models of passive learning where, at the start of operations, there is resolution

upon entry of ex ante uncertainty about pro…tability (see e.g., Jovanovic, 1982).

12

markets. The small growth of total exports to the EU relative to other destinations is only
replicated by the …rst quintile. Moreover, while the EU exhibits no important di¤erences with
respect to the US in quintiles 2 through 4, in the …fth quintile exports to the EU actually
show much larger growth than those to the US.
Figure 5 plots (on a log scale) the ratio of each quintile’s sales relative to the sales of the
third quintile. For exports to the United States and Europe, sales by the …rst quintile are
remarkably larger than those by the third quintile, much more so than for other destinations.
This result contrasts with Eaton et al. (2004), who …nd remarkable similarity in the sales
distributions of French exporters across destinations.
We also explore how …rms move from one quintile to another. Table 3 reports year-to-year
transitions across quintiles, de…ned in terms of …rms’total sales (across all destinations). Each
element of the matrix reports the probability that a …rm in the quintile corresponding to the
column in year t

1 transits into the quintile corresponding to the row in year t; with entry

from not exporting and exit from exporting added possibilities. We de…ne the population of
…rms as those that exported at least once during the 1996-2005 sample period. (There are,
of course, many more …rms selling in Colombia that never exported over our sample period
while, at the same time, many of the …rms in our population did not exist in all sample years.)
Only …rms in the top two quintiles face more than half a chance of staying in their quintile
or higher. Only those in the top three quintiles face more than half a chance of surviving. At
the same time, of those …rms that didn’t export in period t

1 but did export in period t; one

in three start in the …fth percentile, but a surprising one in six start in the second percentile.
Table 4 ‡eshes out the potential link between size on entry and longevity of the …rm in

13

exporting. The bottom row reports the fraction of entrants in each quintile in year of entry.
A third of entrants start in the smallest (…fth quintile) while 4 percent begin in the top one.
The elements in the matrix report the probability that a …rm that entered in the quintile in
the column transits into the quintile in the row the following year. Only sellers in the top
quintile face a higher probability of continuing than of exiting. Hence initial …rst year sales
are an excellent indicator of survival. Nevertheless, about 10 percent of …rms that enter in
the …fth quintile transit into quintiles with more sales by the following year.

4.4

Interaction Across Markets

Table 5 provides a similar decomposition as Table 1 for the 10 most popular destinations.
Going beyond Table 1, however, it distinguishes continuing exporters, entrants, and exiters
according to their participation in other markets in the same year (t) or previous year (t

1).

Speci…cally, for continuing …rms, we separate …rms that sell only in market n from those that
sell in other markets as well in year t. We separate …rms that enter market n into “old”
entrants, who exported to some other country in t
nowhere in t

1; and “new” entrants who exported

1. Similarly, we classify …rms that exit from exporting to n into …rms that

continue exporting in t to some other destination, and those that drop exporting altogether.
See the Table notes for the precise de…nitions. Since we report averages across years the
…gures don’t obey exactly the identity equivalent to (1).
Among continuing …rms, those selling in multiple markets represent a much larger share
of total sales, especially in less popular markets. This pattern is consistent with Eaton et
al.’s (2007) model, in which …rms with low marginal costs or highly appealing products reach

14

more export markets, and sell relatively large volumes in those markets where less e¢ cient
exporters are also present. There does not appear to be any systematic di¤erence between the
growth of sales of …rms selling to multiple markets and just that particular market; in some
markets the former grow much rapidly, while in others the opposite is the case.
New entrants are particularly important, relative to entrants that were already selling
in other markets, in those countries that represent the largest shares of exports: the US,
the EU, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama.9 For other destinations, such as the Dominican
Republic, this pattern is reversed. Because they tend to export much more, however, entry
by experienced exporters tends to contribute much more to growth in all destinations.
It is also the case that, for popular destinations, …rms that cease exporting altogether
are more numerous than …rms that exit that market but continue exporting elsewhere, while
the opposite is true for the average destination. Taken together, these patterns suggest that
countries are attractive as proving grounds for new exporters either if they o¤er a relatively
large and diversi…ed consumer base (the US and the EU), or they are relatively easy to access
(Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama). Other destinations seem to be visited mostly by …rms
that export elsewhere.

4.5

Numbers, Revenues, and Size

We saw in the growth decompositions that large numbers of …rms enter or exit each destination market every year. We now examine these entering and exiting …rms in more detail,
distinguishing those that are present for only one year from those that remain for longer periods. Table 6 reports, for each year in our sample that is not an endpoint, data on …rms
9

Jointly, these countries capture over 70 percent of Colombian merchandise exports.

that: (i) enter exporting, (ii) continue exporting, (iii) exit from exporting, and (iv) export for
just one year. Entry and exit are de…ned di¤erently from above, where we were just referring
to pairwise entry and exit (i.e., entry and exit de…ned over t

1 and t). With the pairwise

de…nitions above, a …rm that exports only in year t is considered as entering in that year and
exiting in the following year, and it is not treated di¤erently from other …rms that export for
longer periods. Here we di¤erentiate single-year exporters from …rms that start exporting and
keep doing so for at least an additional year, and from …rms that exit after having exported
for at least two consecutive years. More speci…cally, entrants in year t are now …rms that not
only: (i) did not export in t

1 and (ii) exported in t; but (iii) must export in t + 1 as well.

Exiters in t must (i) export in t
must not only (i) export in t

1; (ii) export in t, and (iii) not export in t + 1. Continuers
1 and (ii) export in t; as above, but (iii) export in t + 1 as

well. The remaining …rms, those that exported in t but not in t

1 or t + 1 are what we call

“single year”exporters. As mentioned, they would have been included with both entering and
exiting …rms in our pairwise de…nitions above.
The top panel of Table 6, looking across exporters to any destination, presents the numbers
of such …rms for each year. The middle panel presents the total value of their exports while the
bottom panel reports mean exports per …rm, which is the ratio of the corresponding number
in the middle panel to the corresponding number on the top panel.
Starting with the counts, Table 6 con…rms that single year exporters are very common.10
It further shows that the total number of exporting …rms varies over the period substantially,
dropping from 10,517 in 1996 to a trough of 6,765 …rms in 1999 (a year of deep recession),
10

This high exit rate among …rst-year exporters is consistent with Besedes’s (2006) …ndings using 10-digit

product level data on U.S. exports.

16

rising back to 11,720 by the end of the period. This volatility was due to single year exporters
and, to a lesser extent, exiting …rms. The number of entering and continuing …rms exhibits
smaller ‡uctuations around trend growth. The second panel shows, as was suggested by Table
1, that continuing …rms provide the bulk of exports for all the years.
As shown in the third panel, continuing …rms export the most per …rm by a huge amount.
Note that exports per continuing …rm have not grown, but have ‡uctuated around US$ 3
million. The growth in total exports of continuing …rms, and therefore most aggregate growth,
has been overwhelmingly at the extensive margin of continuing …rms although, as documented
earlier, net entry contributed several percentage points to growth during 2003-2005. Both the
number of continuing exporter …rms and the total amount they exported rose about 50 percent
over the period, while exports per continuing …rm remained stable.
Entering and exiting …rms have been similar in size to each other, small, and volatile
year to year. Single year exporters have been much smaller still. Several interpretations are
available for the fact that so many …rms are jumping into and out of foreign markets, earning
little revenue while they are in. One is that sunk entry costs are quite modest for a large
fraction of producers. Given that other studies have found signi…cant entry costs for many
…rms (Roberts and Tybout, 1997a; Das et al., 2007), this interpretation further suggests that
the costs of “testing the waters” may be substantially less than the cost of locking in major
exporting contracts. Such a two-tiered entry cost structure is implied by Rauch and Watson’s
(2003) model of international matching between buyers and sellers. An alternative (and not
necessarily competing) interpretation is that …rms undergo serially-correlated productivity or
product quality shocks. Those that experience a sequence of very favorable draws …nd that

17

exporting is very pro…table, and they persistently do so on a large scale. In contrast, those
with draws just su¢ cient to induce them to export do so on a small scale, and frequently
experience shocks negative enough to bump them out of foreign markets altogether. This is
the mechanism used by Das et al. (2007) to explain patterns of exporter turnover and sales
heterogeneity.11
Table 7 presents the results for individual destinations, averaging across the ten most
popular. While the numbers are scaled down the overall picture is very similar.

5

Analysis by Cohort

From Table 1 we saw that entering …rms made only a very small contribution to export growth
in the year of entry, although gross entry explained almost half of growth over the full eight
year period. To examine the connection between the small year-to-year e¤ect and the large
long-term e¤ect we investigate the role that entrants play as their cohort ages, as surviving
members acquire experience in foreign markets.12 In doing so, we come closer to characterizing
the “life cycle”of an exporting episode, getting a better sense of what would happen to export
sales if new …rms faced higher barriers to initiating foreign operations.
11

Another dimension underlying the pattern of export entry which may be of relevance, and is left for future

research, is whether the …rm is linked with a multinational corporation that may have partially sunk some of
the costs associated with distribution and product placement associated with penetration of new markest. The
evidence in Kugler (2006) shows that in other important dimensions such as productivity, scale, skill intensity
and capital intensity, multinational a¢ liate manufacturing plants display higher averages than domestically
owned ones.
12

Brooks (2006) performs a similar analysis using Colombian plant-level data.

18

Table 8 presents data on the activity of …rms that enter in a particular year t over the
remaining years of our sample. A …rm is assigned to cohort t if the …rst report of an export
transaction by that …rm over our whole period of study occurs in year t. We don’t know
what …rms did before 1996 but, for comparison purposes, we report …rms present in 1996 as
if they belonged to a “1996” cohort. Hence …gures for this “cohort” should be interpreted
very di¤erently, as they combine …rms starting to export in 1996 and survivors from previous
cohorts.
In parallel with Tables 6 and 7 the top panel reports the number of …rms, the middle panel
the total exports of these …rms, and the bottom panel the consequent average exports per
…rm. Note …rst that the survival rate among …rst-year exporters is typically around one-third,
and in some cases is much lower. Thus an enormous “weeding out” occurs in the year of
entry.13
Interestingly, however, the survival rate typically rises substantially after the …rst year to
.8 or .9, except in the last year in the sample, when it is much lower across all cohorts. Thus
…rms that make it through the …rst year are much more likely to survive to the end of the
period. This …nding is consistent with learning on both sides of the market, as discussed
above.
Turning to total sales, those of …rms that were present in 1996 remain quite stable at about
US$ 10 billion until the last two years, when they grew substantially, in parallel with total
exports. At the end of the period their exports still accounted for 76 percent of total foreign
sales. On the other hand, post-1996 entrants gain market share relative to the 1996 cohort in
most years, and account for 47 percent of the expansion in total exports between 1996 and
13

This result was of course implied by the large number of one-year exporters discussed above.

19

2005, as was also seen in Table 1.14 Di¤erent cohorts grow at di¤erent rates, however. Some
(such as the 1998 cohort) are slow to blossom, while others (such as the 2000 cohort) establish
themselves quickly.
In terms of exports per …rm, size jumps substantially after the …rst year. Hence, even
though many …rms drop out after the …rst year, total exports by the cohort do not fall
accordingly. As of 2005, …rms that exported in 1996 remained over four times larger than
those in any entering cohort. But older cohorts are not always larger than younger ones. The
2000 cohort has the most exports per …rm among entering …rms.
Table 9 reports results of a similar exercise for the ten most popular destinations; results
for the average destination (among the ten most popular ones) are reported. The overall
patterns are similar although, across these individual destinations, the 2001 rather than the
2000 cohort stands out as the most successful among entrants, while the 1998 cohort looks
closer to average. Also, post-1996 entrants play a more important role in the most popular
destinations, accounting for 70 percent of the export expansion by 2005.
To summarize, in the aggregate or within individual markets, …rms that exported in the
…rst sample year (1996) remain more numerous 10 years later than any but the most recent
cohort. These long-time exporters continue to be the largest, both in total export sales and
in exports per …rm. Nonetheless, post-1996 entrants account for roughly half of the total
expansion in exports over the sample period. Although each wave of entering …rms exhibits
very high attrition rates within a year of their appearance, those new exporters that survive
this initial shakedown are very likely to thrive. Cohorts di¤er in their performance over the
years, with leapfrogging in size occurring. The heterogeneity in export growth conditional on
14

They account for 100 percent of the expansion between 1996 and 2003.

20

survival suggests that, among …rms attaining the threshold pro…tability of operating in a new
destination, there is a wide variety in export performance thereafter.15

6

Cross-Market Dynamics

We now use transition matrices to characterize cross-market patterns of entry and exit in more
detail. Table 10 breaks our sample into …rms that sell to di¤erent numbers of destination
markets: none, one, two, three to …ve, and so on, and then documents year-to-year transition
frequencies between the categories. Again, we de…ne the population of …rms to be those that
exported at least once during the 1996-2005 sample period. The bottom row of Table 10
reports the fraction of …rms in each cell at the beginning of the period. Note that the modal
number of destination markets is zero, with the frequency of …rms selling to multiple markets
declining in the number of markets.16
The main part of Table 10 reports the frequency with which …rms assigned to the column
categories in year t 1 transited to the various row categories in year t. The columns thus sum
to 100. As expected, non-exporters almost always enter a single market when they initiate
foreign sales, and when …rms add or subtract markets, they are more likely to do so gradually
than in large clumps. This pattern is consistent with the model developed in Eaton et al.
(2007), augmented to allow for serially correlated productivity shocks.
While transition matrices are typically diagonal dominant, note that …rms selling to one
destination are more likely to drop out of exporting than to continue exporting. Here again,
15

Irarrazabal and Opromolla (2006) provide a dynamic model of entry into export markets, based on Luttmer

(2006), that captures some of these elements qualitatively.
16

This result parallels what Eaton et al. (2004) found in a cross-section of French …rms.

21

we are picking up the high failure rates among …rst-year exporters. A similar, albeit more
muted, pattern appears among …rms selling to two destinations. A member of this group is
more likely to drop down to one, or to drop out of exporting altogether, than to continue
selling to two or more. Only …rms selling to three or more destinations are more likely to
stay where they are or move up. The most stable …rm types are the non-exporters and those
selling to 10 or more destinations.
Applying the transition matrix over and over again to an arbitrary initial allocation of …rms
across the cells gives the ergodic distribution implied by the transition matrix. Doing so 1000
times (by which point the distribution of cells had converged) yields an ergodic distribution
very close to the initial one given in the bottom row.
We can also look at transitions across various groups of destinations. We …rst assign
destinations to three groups: the United States, neighbors (Venezuela and Ecuador), and
others. We then look at the various combinations of these groups. We create cells of these
di¤erent combinations and, as above, include a cell for not exporting in year t

1, conditional

on exporting in some year of our sample period. Table 11 reports the groups and the transitions
between them.
The bottom row of Table 11 reports the initial frequency of …rms in the di¤erent cells.
No destinations is most common, followed by “others,” “neighbors,” and the United States.
Notable is the lack of overlap between …rms selling to the United States and …rms selling to
neighbors. The transition matrix is highlighted to show transitions between cells involving
the same number and di¤erent number of destination categories.
The fact that the numbers in any row are quite di¤erent across columns implies that a

22

…rm’s probabilities of moving into di¤erent markets depend upon its current market position.
For example …rms in the “neighbors”group are much more likely to move into “neighbors and
others”than …rms in the “others”market are. More generally, the “neighbors”cell o¤ers the
greatest promise of launching into a larger number of destination groups (with frequency .1,
compared with .08 for others and the United States). On the other hand, the …rst row indicates
that …rms are most likely to drop out of exporting from the US cell, followed closely by the
“others”cell. A non-trivial fraction of …rms selling to more than one destination also drop out
from exporting by the following period. The cell containing neighbors and the United States is
the least stable, o¤ering the greatest chance of launching into the cell with all three groups but
also the greatest chance of dropping down to zero or one destination. This path dependence
may re‡ect di¤erences in the types of products that are exported to di¤erent destinations,
destination-speci…c threshold costs for exporters breaking into new markets (which create
incentives to stay put), or some combination of both factors.
The “others” category in Table 11 pools some very heterogeneous countries. To give a
more detailed picture of trade with countries in this residual group, Table 12 breaks countries
falling under this “others” heading into two subgroups: (i) non-neighbor Latin American
countries and (ii) the EU and the rest of the world (ROW). (OECD countries dominate the
second category.) We had seen in Table 11 that the “neighbors”category showed the greatest
probability of diversifying into more markets; Table 12 shows that this expansion occurs
mainly by entering other countries in Latin America. Moreover, while it is as likely that in
t

1 that a …rm exports solely to the neighbors category as it is that it exports to other

destinations in Latin America, the two categories di¤er in that the “neighbors”column shows

23

higher probability of both continuing exporting and diversifying into new markets. Firms that
sell only to other Latin American destinations in t 1 stop exporting in t with probability 0.64,
compared to 0.56 for …rms that export only to the neighboring destinations. Also, moving to
the rows of “Neighbors, LA”or “Neighbors, USA, LA”occurs with probability 0.07 for …rms
that start selling only to neighbors, compared to 0.04 for those that start in the “LA” only
column.
Once a …rm exports to both neighbors and other Latin American destinations, it enjoys
a 24 percent chance to expand further to reach an OECD destination while …rms that sell
only to neighbors or only to other countries Latin America are very unlikely to do so. Thus,
while neither neighbors nor Latin America stand alone as “stepping stones,”jointly they often
constitute the …rst two rungs to climb in the ascent to reach either the US and other OECD
countries.
A similar exercise (not reported) was conducted separating the EU rather than Latin
America from others. The results show that very few Colombian …rms sell to the EU, and
that it is an unlikely destination for an initiate. At the same time, the few …rms that sell only
to the EU are less likely to increase their groups of destinations and are most likely, among
single group exporters, to drop out of exporting. These patterns trace at least partly to the
fact that the EU has remained a stagnant market from the perspective of Colombian …rms.

7

Summary

Each year, large numbers of new Colombian exporters appear in foreign markets. Most drop
out by the following year, but a small fraction survive and grow very rapidly. Thus, while

24

the entering cohort in any given year makes a trivial contribution to total export sales, its
contribution over a longer period is signi…cant. Indeed, over the course of a decade almost
half of the total growth in Colombian merchandise exports was attributable to …rms that
were not initially exporters. One interpretation of this pattern is that new exporters and
their potential buyers undergo a period of learning about one another. As the uncertainty is
resolved, exporters either expand their sales substantially or abandon the particular market.
While aggregate export levels are primarily accounted for by big established …rms, there
is an apparently important role of experimentation and selection. As explained above, entry
is important to export growth. In fact, the panel data shed light on the life-cycle of exporters
by showing that new exporters upon survival of the …rst year are crucial to growth. While
other studies have found signi…cant entry costs into export markets by individual …rms, our
…nding of substantial short-lived entry suggests that the costs of shipping small volumes to
new destinations are relatively small for many …rms. Those costs may be viewed as part of
the larger cost of establishing lucrative long-term export contracts. This two-tiered entry cost
structure is consistent with learning in export markets by both buyers and sellers.
There appear to be dominant geographic expansion and contraction paths that …rms follow as they add or subtract foreign destinations. Neighboring markets appear to act as
stepping stones for other Latin American markets. Once …rms have successfully penetrated
both neighboring and other Latin American destinations, they are more likely to reach larger
OECD markets (including the US and EU), but not vice versa. These patterns may well re‡ect
demand mix e¤ects, or market sizes and distances, as formalized in Eaton et al. (2007). But
they may also re‡ect learning processes at work and regional di¤erences in the mix of products

25

demanded. That is, success in smaller markets may provide a signal that the expected payo¤
of testing the waters in larger markets exceeds the sunk costs.

Notes: this table reports the annual growth rate of total exports decomposed into the contribution of pairwise continuing, entering, and exiting firms. Pairwise continuing firms in t are those that
exported in t-1 and t. Pairwise entering firms in t are those that exported in t but not in t-1. Pairwise exiting firms in t are those that did export in t-1 but not in t. The contribution of pairwise
continuers is the product of columns (2) and (3). Percentage contribution of each term to growth of total exports reported in parenthesis.

Notes: this table decomposes the contribution of pairwise continuing, exiting, and entering firms to exports growth in a given destination, classifying firms according to whether they sell to other destinations in t or t-1.
A pairwise continuing firm in t is one that exported to market n in t-1 and t. It is defined as single-market continuer if it exported to a single market in t-1 and t and as multiple-market continuer if it exported to multiple
markets in t-1 or t. A pairwise entering firm in t is one that exported to market n in t but not in t-1. It is defined as new-entrant if it did not export in year t-1 to other markets, and as old-entrant otherwise. A pairwise
exiting firm in t is one that exported to market n in t-1 but did not export to n in t. It is defined as exiting-dying in every market if it does not export to any market in t and as exiting-continuing in some other market if it
continues to export to at least one other market in t. The ten most popular destinations are characterized as described in Figure 4. For other relevant definitions see Table 1.

Notes: this table reports numbers of continuing, exiting, entering, and single year exporting firms in a given destination, as well as
value of exports in each category, using three year definitions of entry and exit. For a given destination n, continuing firms in t are
those that exported to market n in t-1, t and t+1. Entering firms in t are those that did not export to market n in t-1, and exported to
market n in t and t+1. Exiting firms in t are those that exported to market n in t-1 and t, but not in t+1. Single-year exporters in t are
those that exported to market n in t, but not in t-1 nor in t+1. The average for the ten most popular destinations is reported. The ten
most popular markets are characterized as in Figure 4.
