Labor Market Status and Transitions during the Pre-Retirement Years: Learning from International
Differences

ABSTRACT
Many western industrialized countries face strong budgetary pressures due to the aging of the baby
boom generations and the general trends toward earlier ages of retirement. We use the American PSID
and the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) to explain differences in prevalence and dynamics
of self-reported work disability and labor force status. To that end we specify a two-equation dynamic
panel data model describing the dynamics of labor force status and self-reported work disability. When
we apply the U.S. parameters to the equations for the thirteen European countries we consider, the
result is generally that work disability is lower and employment is higher. Furthermore, measures of
employment protection across the different countries suggest that increased employment protection
reduces reentry into the labor force and hence is a major factor explaining employment differences
in the pre-retirement years.

1. Introduction

Increasing labor force participation among older workers is an important issue on
the scientific and policy agenda in the U.S. and other industrialized countries. Major
categories of individuals who are out of the labor force at later ages consist of persons
drawing disability benefits, unemployment benefits, and early retirement benefits. Crosscountry differences in the prevalence of early retirement are clearly related to differences
in financial incentives (Gruber and Wise, 2003, Börsch-Supan, 2007). The fraction of
workers on disability insurance is vastly different across countries with similar levels of
economic development and comparable access to modern medical technology and
treatment.
Health is also a major determinant of economic inactivity, and those who have a
health problem that limits them in their daily activities or in the amount or kind of work
they can do (a “work disability”) are much less likely to work for pay than others
(Stapleton and Burkhauser, 2003). In view of the aging of the work force in developed
countries, reducing work disability among the working population and particularly
among older workers may have a major impact on the sustainability of social security and
health care systems, among other things. Institutional differences in eligibility rules,
workplace accommodation of older or sick workers, or generosity of benefits, contribute
to explaining the differences in disability rolls (cf., e.g., Bound and Burkhauser, 1999,
Autor and Duggan, 2003, and Börsch-Supan, 2007). Recent survey data show, however,
that significant differences between countries are also found in self-reports of work
limiting disabilities and general health (Banks et al. 2007).
In this paper we use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and
the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) to study the labor force dynamics in
the U.S. and in thirteen European countries. To focus on labor market dynamics in the
pre-retirement years and because these dynamics are likely to differ by gender, we
concentrate on the age group between 40 and 65 and consider males and females
separately. We also investigate the dynamics of work disability (i.e. the extent to which
work disability varies over time and its reversibility) and how this varies across countries.
One of the questions we address is whether we can explain the prevalence of self-

3

reported work disability as a function of individual characteristics, including general
health.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the details of the
data that are used are described. Section 3 discusses some pertinent characteristics of
institutions in Europe and the U.S. that relate especially to the incentives and institutions
of work disability programs. Section 4 presents the model that is used to describe labor
force dynamics in the various countries. The model is estimated for each country
separately. Section 5 presents the estimation results. In Section 6, we summarize the
implications of these results by showing simulations, where we assign U.S. parameter
values to the models for the European countries. The implied differences in outcomes can
be seen as a counterfactual simulation of the impact U.S. policies and institutions would
have when implemented in European countries. Section 7 concludes.

2. Data

Our data come from two sources: the European Community Household Panel
(ECHP) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). Both data sets have reasonably
comparable measures of labor force activity and self-assessed work disability for the
countries that will be included in our analysis. We discuss some issues related to the
comparability of measurement of these key concepts in section 5 below.
The ECHP is an annual longitudinal survey of households in the EU.1 Data were
collected by national statistical agencies under the supervision and coordination of
Eurostat (the statistical office of the EU). Table A1, taken from Eurostat (2003, p.15),
gives an overview of the waves of ECHP in all fifteen countries that participated in the
ECHP project.
The ECHP started in 1994 and was terminated in 2001. The first wave covered
some 60,500 households and some 130,000 adults aged 16 and above from all countries
except Austria, Finland and Sweden. Austria and Finland were added in the second and
third waves. As of the fourth wave, the original ECHP survey was terminated in
Germany, Luxembourg and the UK. Comparable data for these countries were obtained
from existing national panels. For the UK this was the British Household Panel Survey
1

See Nicoletti and Peracchi (2002) and Peracchi (2002) for more information on ECHP.

4

(BHPS), for Germany the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and for Luxembourg the
PSELL (Panel socio-économique Liewen zu Lëtzebuerg). For these countries we will use
the existing national panels rather than the few waves of the ECHP. As of the 4th wave,
data for Sweden were obtained from the Swedish Living Conditions Survey. Since this is
not a panel, we will exclude Sweden from our analysis. We will also not use the
Luxembourg data, since it provides no information on self-reported disability.
The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) has gathered almost 30 years of
extensive economic and demographic data on a nationally representative sample of
approximately 5000 (original) families and 35,000 individuals who live in these families.
Details on labor market activity and family income and its components have been
gathered in each wave since the inception of PSID in 1968. The PSID has been
collecting information on self-reported general health status (the standard five-point scale
from excellent to poor) since 1984 and has always collected good information on workrelated disabilities. To provide comparability in the time period with the EHCP, our
analysis will use the PSID waves between 1995 and 2003. It should be noted that after
the 1999 wave the PSID is no longer annual, but bi-annual.

3. Institutions

There exists great variation in labor market institutions across OECD countries;
regulations with respect to disability insurance are certainly no exception. To get a very
broad overview for a majority of countries in our sample, Figure 1 reports a crude
measure of the generosity of disability benefits – the fraction of GDP accounted for by
public expenditures on disability benefits. Considerable variation across OECD countries
is readily apparent, with France and Italy spending less than 1% of GDP and three
countries – Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands – spending more than twice that level.
Using this metric, the U.S. ranks lower than any of the OECD countries listed in Figure 1.
The variation spending levels can of course be due to variation in benefit levels or
variation in eligibility, or some combination of both.
Looking more deeply into international variation than the simple generosity
measure presented above, various dimensions can be distinguished. The main ones are
the loss of earnings capacity required to qualify for benefits and the way in which such

5

loss of earnings capacity is assessed, eligibility requirements based on work or
contribution history, and benefit levels in relation to loss of earnings capacity. Table A2
provides an overview of the main features of disability insurance systems in the countries
we study in this paper.

Table A2 illustrates the complexity of these disability programs across countries.
For example, while many countries have a basic five years minimum period of eligibility
(for example, Germany, Austria, Italy, Portugal), basic eligibility is as low as six months
in Belgium and one year in France while one is not fully covered unless one has worked
for ten years in the United States. Similarly, while the loss of normal earnings capacity is
sufficient to qualify for eligibility in Spain, one must have a loss of two-thirds of earnings
capacity in France, Belgium, and Portugal.

Not surprisingly, the variation in DI systems identified in Table A2 is correlated
with differences in prevalence of DI receipt across countries and in the disability status of
individuals receiving DI. Börsch-Supan (2007) showed that in a cross-sectional context
variation in incentives and institutional rules across a series of European countries and
the United States can account for differences across these countries in the fractions of
individuals on work disability programs. In contrast, variation in demographic attributes
and health across these countries did little to explain these differences.
In this paper, we do not attempt to analyze being on the disability rolls but instead
aim at explaining the cross-sectional and dynamic variation across countries in selfassessed work disability and work. Table 1 shows for 2001 the relation between what is
probably the best single measure of the scope of a country’s disability program, the
fraction of disability benefits as a fraction of GDP, and the fraction of men who selfreport that they have a work disability.2 There appears to be almost no correlation
between these two measures.

The exact question on work disability in ECHP is: “Are you hampered in your daily activities by any
physical or mental health problem, illness or disability?” In the PSID, it is: “Do you have any physical or
nervous condition that limits the type of work or the amount of work you can do?”

7

Although the incentives and institutions across countries appear to have a great deal to do
with the fraction of workers who are on disability programs, these incentives and
institutions appear to be only weakly related to the fraction of men who claim that they
are work disabled.
Table A3, taken from a recent OECD study, provides information on some
characteristics of DI recipients for most of the countries we are considering in this paper.
The first column shows that a substantial fraction of the people on DI declare that they
have no work disability. This fraction varies a lot across countries and is particularly
large in Sweden (48.9%) and the U.S. (46.7%). Either people are granted DI benefits
while not acknowledging disability status, or those who recover from their disability are
not able to find a job and instead stay on DI, or some combination of both. The third
column of Table A3 shows indeed that exit rates from DI are extremely low. The UK and
the Netherlands seem to be the exceptions in this respect, but this might have to do with
reforms in the disability insurance system in these countries.
The second column of Table A3 shows the other side of the coin – many people
who report to have a (moderate or severe) work disability receive neither earnings nor DI
or other benefits. Again, variation across countries is substantial. In Sweden, almost
everyone with a work disability has earnings from work or receives benefits, but in Spain
and Italy, 28 or 29% receive neither of the two. The U.S. has an intermediate position in
this respect.
Column 4 shows that the expected negative relation between disability and the
chances of being employed holds in all countries: the relative employment rate is always
less than one. Still, there are substantial differences across countries. In Spain, someone
with a work disability is 0.41 times as likely to do paid work as someone without a work
disability, compared to 0.79 in Switzerland. Again, the U.S. is somewhere in the middle
with 0.58. Column 5 shows that there is an earnings differential between workers with
and without a work disability, but in most countries, it is not very large. Here the U.S.

8

and (surprisingly) Sweden are the exceptions – with workers with a disability earning
almost 30% less than workers without disability.3
On the other hand, for those with a work disability, working seems to be an
effective way of increasing income, as is borne out by column 6. This is particularly true
in the U.S., where the disabled who work have an average income that is 2.84 times as
high as the average income of disabled who do not work. In Europe, the differences are
smaller, but even in Sweden and Denmark, the countries with the lowest income
differentials between working and non-working disabled persons, the difference is still 37
or 38%. These cross-country differences seem to be in line with the generosity of
disability insurance systems (as indicated by Figure 1, for example).

4. The Model

In this section, we outline our model of the interrelated dynamics of self-reported
work disability and labor force status (work versus no work). The equation for disability
of individual i in time period t is specified as:
Dit* = X it' β D + γ DD ' Di ,t −1 + γ WDWi ,t −1 + α iD + ε itD
Dit = 1[D*it > 0]

(1)

Here Dit indicates the presence of self-reported work disability; 0 means no
disability and 1 means disability. Lagged labor force status is denoted by an indicator
variable Wi ,t −1 = 1 if the respondent worked in the previous period and Wi ,t −1 = 0
otherwise. The error terms ε itD are assumed to be independent standard normal; α iD is an
individual effect, normally distributed with variance σ α2 . The ε itD and α iD are assumed
mutually independent and independent of the vector of explanatory variables X it .
Thus there are two direct sources of persistence in the disability equation: the
lagged dependent variable Di ,t −1 and the unobserved heterogeneity term α iD . We allow for
a lagged effect of work force status on work disability, but not for a contemporaneous
effect. That is, we are effectively assuming no contemporaneous ‘justification bias’ in
3

A complete analysis of this effect would need to account additionally for differential selection into the
labor market across countries.

9

self-reported disability (justification bias would imply that people say they have a work
disability to justify their non-work status).
The second equation explains whether respondents do paid work or not. Labor
force status Wit is explained by a Probit equation as follows:
Wit* = X it' β W + γ DW Di ,t −1 + γ WW Wi ,t −1 + δ dW Di ,t + α iW + ε itW

(2)

Wit = 1[Wit* > 0]

Thus we allow for both a contemporaneous and a lagged effect of work disability
on labor force status. The assumptions about individual effects and error terms are the
same as before. We do not allow for correlation between the error terms in the two
equations, but we do allow for correlated individual effects. Also here, there are two
direct sources of persistence, lagged labor force status Wi ,t −1 and the individual effect α iW .
The variance-covariance matrix of the individual effects is unrestricted. For
estimation purposes we parameterize it as follows. Let ui = (uiD , uiW ) ~ N 2 (0, I ) . Then we
specify the vector of individual effects α i = (α iD , α iW ) as α = Λu , with

⎛ λDD
Λ=⎜ W
⎝ λD

0 ⎞
⎟,
λWW ⎠

(3)

a lower triangular matrix. The parameter estimates summarized in the next section
include the estimates of the entries in Λ .
To account for the initial conditions problem, we follow Heckman (1981), Hyslop
(1999), and Vella and Verbeek (1999) and specify separate equations for wave 1. These
equations have the same exogenous regressors and contemporaneous dependent variables
on the right hand side as the dynamic equations presented above, but do not include the
lagged dependent variables. No restrictions are imposed on the coefficients or their
relation to the coefficients in the dynamic equations. These coefficients are estimated
jointly with the parameters in the dynamic equations and can be seen as nuisance
parameters.
In the initial condition equations, we include arbitrary linear combinations of the
individual effects in the two dynamic equations. This is the same as including an arbitrary
linear combination of the two entries in ui . The estimated coefficients of these linear
combinations can be seen as nuisance parameters.
10

The above equations must be slightly adapted for the PSID data. In the PSID, the
frequency of interviewing was reduced from once a year to once every two years starting
in 1997.4 As a result, for the more recent years a lagged variable in the PSID model refers
to a value two years ago. Hence in the model for the PSID data we include separate
coefficients for the lagged variables for the case that the previous wave is one year ago
and the case that the previous wave is two years ago.5

5. Results
Our focus in this research is on the dynamics of disability and labor force activity
during the pre-retirement years. These labor market dynamics are likely to be very
different than those that characterize the period of labor market entry when people are
first entering the labor market. Therefore, we estimate our models on samples of people
who are ages forty and over. Separate models are estimated for men and women given
that the dynamics of labor force behavior are potentially very different.
A problem that requires special attention in an exercise like this is the
international comparability of variable definitions. For example, if schools are organized
in very different ways in different countries (as they are), it would be very difficult to
know what it would mean to make comparisons across countries that ‘assume’ that the
schooling levels of workers are the same.
For that reason we have only used a very limited set of covariates: age dummies
for the age groups 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64; year dummies; marital status
(married or not, where married includes cohabitation) and two health dummies.
International comparability of self reported health is a very difficult problem in
itself. Because of this, we have adopted the following simple approach: In the U.S. and
European data respectively we find the weighted frequency distributions for ages 40-65
(balanced panel) in the top panel of Table 2. Based on this we collapse the five categories
into three; combining the first two and the last two, essentially ignoring the wording

4

To be precise, we use PSID waves 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2001 and 2003.
To be precise, for the years 1995, 1996, 1997, only the one year lags are included; for the years 1999,
2001, and 2003, only the two year lags are included.

The health distribution is now similar in the U.S. and the European countries. In the
analysis section below, we discuss what the implications for work disability and labor
market participation would be if health were ‘the same’ in all countries.
Table A4 summarizes for men and women separately some of the key dynamic
parameters (relating disability and work) estimated from our empirical models. While
there are differences between our estimates for men and women, these tend to be
concentrated in the ‘off-diagonal’ terms – the effects of disability on work status or vice
versa. In most countries (but not all), the effects of lagged disability on current disability
is similar for men and women within each country. To the extent that the effect of lagged
disability on current disability measures the pure transitions of work related health
between the waves, the similarity between men and women may not be that surprising. In
most countries, the effects of lagged employment on current employment are higher for
men than for women. The traditionally more transitory nature of employment for women
would imply a smaller estimated impact of lagged employment.

12

With the exception of Belgium and Finland, the estimated effects of disability on
employment are somewhat larger (in absolute value) for men than for women. Disability
programs whose generosity depends on a past series of contributions would imply greater
generosity for men compared to women and this is what we find. Finally, the effects of
lagged employment on disability may reflect in part the health effects of work. More
likely this is picking up the unobserved effects of health, which is very incompletely
captured in this data. Better health increases the likelihood of work and makes disability
less likely.
Both disability and work status are highly persistent, and significantly so, across
all countries. Current disability is negatively associated with current work status in most
countries, and the relationship is particularly strong in the U.S. (and for women in
Belgium). The evidence for lagged disability affecting current work status over and
above the contemporaneous effect is weaker. There is evidence of lagged employment
status affecting current work disability however.
As one would probably expect, the parameter estimates for the effects of lagged
work status on current work status tend to be relatively low in the U.S., reflecting a
higher turnover than in the European countries (both from working to not working and
from not working to working). At the low end of the European scale in this respect are
the UK and Spain with the other European countries demonstrating somewhat larger
effects.

6. Discussion

To gain a better understanding of the differences between the countries, we carry
out four simulations. The first simulation simply generates values of work and selfreported disability over the sample period in each country, using the estimated models.
The second simulation replaces the country specific parameter estimates for the disability
equation by the corresponding U.S. coefficients, but retains the own country work
parameters. Conversely, the third simulation replaces the country specific parameter
estimates of the work equation by U.S. coefficients, but retains the own country disability
equation. Finally, the fourth simulation replaces the country specific parameters in both
13

equations by U.S. coefficients. In all simulations the initial conditions are generated
according to the country specific estimates.
The figures in Appendix B present time paths of two variables: the percentage of
individuals with a work disability and the percentage of individuals working. For each of
these variables we produce four values, according to the four scenarios sketched above.
Let us first concentrate on work disability. The yellow and light blue lines
represent the scenarios where the U.S. disability parameters are used (the yellow line) or
where both the disability parameters and the work parameters come from the U.S. (the
light blue line). The graphs suggest that the initial conditions only have an effect during
the first couple of years of the simulations. The path of disability moves away from its
initial position very quickly.
In countries where self-reported disability tends to be low, moving to U.S.
parameters will lead to an increase in self-reported work disability. This is the case for
female disability in Belgium, U.K., and the Southern European countries, and for
disability among malesin the UK, Italy and Spain. In some other cases the simulations
with U.S. parameters do not lead to very different time paths of disability, like for
Belgian, Greek, and Portuguese males. In a number of countries, adopting U.S.
parameters leads to a dramatic fall in disability. These cases include males and females in
Germany and Finland, and females in Denmark and the Netherlands.
Another noteworthy aspect of the graphs is that the light blue and yellow lines
tend to be on top of each other for most countries. This suggests that the feedback from
work to disability is quantitatively similar to that in the U.S. (since the yellow line uses
country specific work parameters this should generate deviations from the all U.S. light
blue line if work had an appreciably different effect on disability in Europe compared to
the U.S.). Cases where the feedback from work to disability appears to make a difference
include females in The Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Greece, Spain and Austria.
For males the difference in feedback from work to disability seems to be essentially
immaterial, with the possible exception of Belgium. Inspecting the second column of
Table A4, suggests that the cases with the biggest differences between the yellow and
light blue lines are indeed the cases where the estimated values of γ WD , the effect of
lagged work on disability, deviate most from the U.S. estimate.

14

Now consider the bottom part of the graphs, i.e. the simulation of employment
under the different scenarios. The simulations with all U.S. coefficients lead to final
values that are quite similar across countries: from 0.66 (Portugal) to 0.75 (Belgium,
Ireland) for women, and from 0.76 (Germany) to 0.86 (several countries) for men. The
main sources of differences are initial conditions and demographic and health differences.
A second observation is that the simulation with all U.S. coefficients leads to the highest
employment rate in almost all countries, although often it makes only a negligible
difference whether European or US coefficients are used for the work disability equation.
Exceptions are Italy and the UK where replacing EU disability coefficients by US
coefficients leads to higher work disability and thus lowers employment. As a
consequence, the highest employment rate is attained with US work and EU disability
coefficients.
This argument, however, does not always work: to further isolate the effect of
labor market institutions from the effect of disability, it is of interest to consider the
difference between the yellow line (only disability parameters from the U.S.) and the
light blue line (all parameters from the U.S.) in more countries. It is instructive to take
The Netherlands as an example. When looking at females, we note that the simulation
with U.S. disability coefficients but Dutch work coefficients yields essentially the same
employment rate, despite the fact that disability is much lower with U.S. disability
coefficients. Table A4 tells us immediately why this is so. The parameter γ DW is close to
zero for Dutch females. We also note however that the light blue line (all U.S.
parameters) is about 25 percentage points higher than the yellow line. This suggests that
independent of the disability status of Dutch women, American institutions would
generate a much higher employment rate. The story for Dutch males is qualitatively
similar, but since the employment rate is already high, adopting U.S. coefficients can
only have a limited effect. With this example in mind we observe that in all countries,
with the possible exception of Denmark, the U.K. and Ireland, labor market institutions,
rather than disability, cause the employment rate to be low relative to the U.S.
One can further investigate this by looking at the pink lines (EU disability
parameters, but U.S. work parameters). The relevant comparison now is between the pink
line and the dark blue line (all E.U. parameters). Once again we find that labor market

15

institutions explain the differences in employment rates, rather than differences in
disability.
A different way to obtain insight into the different dynamics across the various
countries is to consider transition matrices. These are given in Table A5 (for disability)
and Table A6 (for work). These key dynamics relate to the transitions between work and
non-work and disability and non-disability. Each can be summarized by two off- diagonal
transitions. For work, the two transitions are the transition from work to non-work and
the transition from non-work to work. Similarly for disability the off-diagonal transitions
are from not disabled to disabled and from disabled to not disabled. Since our interest
concerns how all these transition patterns vary across our set of countries, Tables A7 (for
disability) and A8 (for work) summarize the key parameters by organizing them by the
magnitude of the transitions with the country names attached. Finally, since the U.S. will
be the benchmark for all countries in our simulations we list the U.S. parameter at the
bottom of each list.
Consider first the disability transitions. We observe considerable variation in the
inflow rates into disability (the transition from being not disabled in one period to being
disabled the next period). For men these rates vary from 18% in Germany to 4% in the
U.S., U.K., and Italy. For women the rates vary from 21% in Germany to 5% in Ireland,
Italy, and Belgium. The U.S. is near the bottom with 6%. On the other hand outflow
rates out of disability (the transition from being disabled in one period and not disabled in
the next period) vary less, at least in relative terms. For men the rates vary from 42% in
Italy to 23% in Germany and Denmark, while for women the rates vary from 49% in Italy
to 22% in Germany.
There are a number of salient patterns to these disability transitions. First, while
the levels differ between men and women, the country rankings are remarkably similar by
gender suggesting that the variation across countries is at least partly due to institutional
variation affecting men and women in a similar way. To illustrate, Germany ranks
highest on the transition into disability for both sexes while Italy ranks highest in the
transition from work disability into non-work disability. Second, for almost all the
countries listed there exists considerable churning between work and non-work disability
indicating that work disability is far from a permanent condition even at these older ages

16

(cf. Kapteyn, Smith and Van Soest, 2007). Consequently, cross-sectional analysis of
work disability status will not be able to capture some of the main features of work
disabilities during the pre-retirement years. Third, compared to the European countries,
the U.S. ranks very low on the transition into work disability while it ranks in the middle
of the pack in the transitions out of work disability.
Work disability will tend to be high when the transition into work disability is high while
the transition out of work disability is low. Germany, Denmark, and Finland would be the
best prototypes of such behavior. On the other hand, other countries have a relatively low
transition into disability matched with a relatively high transition out of disability. Italy,
Greece, and Spain would be good illustrations of that behavior and in those countries the
steady state levels of work disability will be low.
Consider next the ranking of the transitions between work and non-work for
countries listed in Table A8. First, we note that the variation in transitions from work to
non-work varies less across countries than the transitions from non-work to work. Thus
most of the variation across countries in labor market dynamics relates to whether
persons who are out of the labor force are likely to transit back into the labor force. To
illustrate, for men, transition rates from non-work to work vary from 31% in the U.K. to
as low as 3% in Austria and Belgium. Indeed the countries where moving back into the
labor force appears to be least likely, are very similar for men and women alike. These
countries would include Italy, France, Belgium, and Austria.
In contrast, the U.S. has a relatively high rate of transition back into the labor
force for both sexes compared to all countries. It is in comparisons between the U.S. and
Italy, France, Belgium, and Austria, that the effects on employment are quite dramatic.
For example, the chart for Austria in Appendix B shows a very low employment rate
towards the end of the observation period. For women, among the European countries the
U.K. has the highest inflow into employment (16%), while Belgium has the lowest inflow
(3%). The chart for Belgium in Appendix B confirms that female employment in
Belgium is very low in comparison with other countries.
In sharp contrast, Table A8 shows much less variation in transitions from work to
non-work especially for men. The full range of values for men in Table A8 is only from
0.03 (Denmark) to 0.08 (Germany) with the U.S. at a value of 0.07. In fact, eight of the

17

thirteen European countries in Table A8 for men lie within two percentage points of the
U.S. transition value from work to not work. Thus, the source of the labor market
dynamic differences amongst these countries appears not to lie in the ease or difficulty of
the transition from work to not-work. Instead, it is the relative rigidity of some European
countries in discouraging re-entry into the labor force that appears to be the major issue.
This is further illustrated by Table A9. The last four columns of Table A9 contain
the same transition rates as Table A8, but in addition the first two columns contain
measures of employment protection and replacement rates at retirement. The employment
protection measure is taken from OECD (2004) and is the sum of three main components
reflecting respectively (1) difficulty of dismissal, (2) procedural inconveniences an
employer faces in the dismissal process, (3) severance pay provisions (OECD, 2004, p.
65). The measure presented here is “version 2, late 1990s” (see Table 2.A2.4 in OECD,
2004). The replacement rate shown in the table is the replacement rate of a worker with
average earnings in a country, as calculated in OECD (2005). The countries in Table A9
have been ranked according to the employment protection measure. Somewhat
remarkably it is particularly the transitions from non-work to work that are affected by
the employment protection index: for both women and men, more employment protection
implies a smaller transition rate back into employment. A similar finding is reported in
OECD (2004). On the other hand the protective effect seems to be limited; transition
rates out of employment do not correlate significantly with the employment protection
measure.
In view of the age range we are considering, a measure of a retirement
replacement rate has been included, since one would expect that some workers who are
temporarily out of the labor force will transit into retirement rather than back into
employment if that alternative is sufficiently attractive. Table A9 indeed shows the
expected negative correlation. However, when regressing the transition rates on both the
employment protection measure and the replacement rate measure we find the former to
be significant, but not the latter.

7. Conclusion

18

In this paper, we have investigated the dynamics of labor force and work
disability behavior among individuals between 40 and 65 in several Western European
countries and the United States. We estimated the dynamics of labor force and disability
behavior separately for men and women using high quality panel data in 13 European
countries and the United States. We find substantial differences in labor force dynamics
between the countries. Adopting U.S. parameters (i.e. U.S. institutions and norms) often
leads to considerable reductions in self-reported disability. Although this has some effect
on employment rates, most of the action is in the labor market institutions themselves,
where adopting U.S. coefficients may generate substantially higher employment rates.
Comparison of transition rates with aggregate measures of employment protection
suggests that these play a major role in generating the observed differences across
countries.

Notes to table A4:
Results for the U.S. are coefficients on one-year lagged variables although two-year lags are also included
to control for the varying periodicity of PSID data. All specifications also include year dummies, controls
for education, age group, marital status, self-reported general health status, and (in the U.S. case)
ethnicity. Equations for the initial conditions use the same variable.
