Measuring Ancient Inequality
Branko Milanovic, Peter H. Lindert, and Jeffrey G. Williamson
NBER Working Paper No. 13550
October 2007
JEL No. D3,N3,O1
ABSTRACT
Is inequality largely the result of the Industrial Revolution? Or, were pre-industrial incomes and life
expectancies as unequal as they are today? For want of sufficient data, these questions have not yet
been answered. This paper infers inequality for 14 ancient, pre-industrial societies using what are known
as social tables, stretching from the Roman Empire 14 AD, to Byzantium in 1000, to England in 1688,
to Nueva España around 1790, to China in 1880 and to British India in 1947. It applies two new concepts
in making those assessments -- what we call the inequality possibility frontier and the inequality extraction
ratio. Rather than simply offering measures of actual inequality, we compare the latter with the maximum
feasible inequality (or surplus) that could have been extracted by the elite. The results, especially when
compared with modern poor countries, give new insights in to the connection between inequality and
economic development in the very long run.

1. Good Questions, Bad Data?
Is inequality largely a byproduct of the Industrial Revolution? Or, were preindustrial incomes and life expectancies as unequal as they are today? How does
inequality in today’s least developed, agricultural countries compare with that of ancient
societies dating back to the Roman Empire? Did some parts of the world always have
greater income inequality than others? Was inequality augmented by colonization? These
questions have not been answered yet, for want of sufficient data. Our effort to gather
these data has not been easy, even though we were well warned of the pitfalls facing any
attempt to explore pre-industrial income gaps between rich and poor.
Simon Kuznets was very skeptical of attempts to compare income inequalities
across countries when he was writing in the 1970s. In his view, the early compilations
assembled by the International Labor Organization and the World Bank referred to
different population concepts, different income concepts, and different parts of the
national economy. To underline his doubts, Kuznets once asked (rhetorically) at a
University of Wisconsin seminar “Do you really think you can get good conclusions from
bad data?” Economists with interest in inequality are indebted to Kuznets for his sage
warning. 1 We are even more indebted to Kuznets for violating his own warning when,
earlier in his career, he famously conjectured about his Kuznets Curve based on a handful
of very doubtful inequality observations. His 1954 Detroit AEA Presidential Address
mused on how inequality might have risen and fallen over two centuries, and theorized
about the sectoral and demographic shifts that might have caused such movements. Over

1

His Wisconsin seminar paper became a classic (Kuznets 1976).

3

the last half century, economists have responded enthusiastically to his postulated
Kuznets Curve, searching for better data, better tests, and better models.
As we have said, Kuznets based his hypothetical Curve on very little evidence.
The only country for which he had good data was the United States after 1913, on which
he was the data pioneer himself. Beyond that, he judged earlier history from tax data
taken from the United Kingdom since 1880 and Prussia since 1854 (1955, p. 4). For these
three advanced countries, incomes had become more unequal between the late nineteenth
century and the 1950s. He presented no data at all regarding earlier trends, yet bravely
conjectured that “income inequality might have been widening from about 1780 to 1850
in England; from about 1840 to 1890, and particularly from 1870 on in the United States;
and from the 1840’s to the 1890’s in Germany” (1955, p. 19). For poor, pre-industrial
countries, he had only household surveys for India 1949-1950, Sri Lanka 1950, and
Puerto Rico 1948 (1955, p. 20). These are all bad data judged by the standards Kuznets
himself applied in the 1970s. They are also bad data judged by the modern World Bank
standards since those three surveys from the mid-20th-century would now be given low
grades on the Deininger-Squire scale assessing the quality of income distribution data
(Deininger and Squire, 1996: pp. 567-71). Meanwhile, world inequalities have also
changed. The convergence of incomes within industrial countries that so impressed
Kuznets has been reversed, and the gaps have widened again.
We have reason, therefore, to ask anew whether income inequality was any
greater in the distant past than it is today. This paper offers five conjectures about
inequality patterns during and since ancient pre-industrial times:

4

(1) Income inequality must have risen as hunter-gathers slowly evolved into
ancient agricultural settlements with surpluses above subsistence. Inequality rose
further as economic development in these early agricultural settlements gave the
elite the opportunity to harvest those rising surpluses.
(2) Yet, the evidence suggests that the elite failed to exploit their opportunity fully
since income inequality did not rise anywhere near as much as it could have.
While potential inequality rose steeply over the very long run, actual inequality
rose much less.
(3) In ancient pre-industrial times, inequality was driven largely by the gap
between the rural poor at the bottom and the landed elite at the top. The
distribution of income among the elite themselves, and their share in total income,
contributed far less to overall inequality, and never consistently.
(4) Ancient pre-industrial inequality seems to have been lower in East Asia than it
was in the Middle East, Europe, or the world as settled by Europeans, suggesting
long period persistence in region-specific distributions.
(5) While there is little difference in conventionally measured inequality between
modern and ancient pre-industrial societies, there are immense differences in two
other, less conventional, dimensions. First, the share of potential inequality
actually achieved today is far less than was true of pre-industrial times. Second,
life expectancy inequality was far greater two centuries ago than it is today. The
decline in survival inequality in the twentieth century has contributed mightily to
the convergence of lifetime incomes in the world economy.

5

Our data are subject to all the concerns that bothered Kuznets, other economists,
and the present authors. Our income inequality statistics exploit fragile measures of
annual household income, without adjustment for taxes and transfers, life-cycle patterns,
or household composition. None of our ancient inequality observations would rate a “1”
on the Deininger-Squire scale. Yet, like Gregory King in the 1690s and Simon Kuznets in
the 1950s, we must start somewhere. Section 2 begins by introducing some new concepts
that we use for the analysis -- the inequality possibility frontier and the inequality
extraction ratio, measures of the extent to which the elite extract the maximum feasible
inequality. These new measures open the door to fresh interpretations of inequality in the
very long run. The next section presents our ancient inequality evidence. Section 4
examines income gaps between top and bottom, and the extent to which observed
inequality change over the very long run is driven by those gaps as opposed to the
distribution of income among those at the top or the top’s income share. Section 5
explores how the stylized facts are changed when conventional annual income measures
are replaced by lifetime income measures. We conclude with a research agenda.

2. The Inequality Possibility Frontier

The workhorse for our empirical analysis of ancient inequalities is a concept we
call the inequality possibility frontier. While the idea is simple enough, it has surprisingly
been overlooked by past authors. Suppose that each society, including ancient nonindustrial societies, has to distribute income in such a way as to guarantee subsistence
minimum for its poorer classes. The remainder of the total income is the surplus that is

6

shared among the richer classes. When average incomes are very low, and barely above
the subsistence minimum, the surplus is small. Under those primitive conditions, the
members of the upper class will be few, and the level of inequality will be quite modest.
But as average incomes increase with economic progress, this constraint on inequality is
lifted; the surplus increases, and the maximum possible inequality compatible with that
new, higher, average income is greater. In other words, the maximum attainable
inequality is an increasing function of mean overall income. Whether the elite fully
exploit that maximum, and whether some trickle-down allows the subsistence minimum
to rise, is, of course, another matter entirely.
To fix ideas intuitively, suppose that a society consists of 100 people, 99 of whom
are lower class. Assume further that the subsistence minimum is 10 units, and total
income 1050 units. The 99 members of the lower class receive 990 units of income and
the only member of the upper class receives 60. The Gini coefficient corresponding to
such a distribution will be only 4.7 percent. If total income improves over time to 2000
units, then the sole upper class member will be able to extract 1010 units, and the
corresponding Gini coefficient will leap to 49.5 percent. If we chart the locus of such
maximum possible Ginis on the vertical axis against mean income levels on the
horizontal axis, we obtain the inequality possibility frontier (IPF). 2 Note also that by
virtue of the fact that any progressive transfer must reduce inequality measured by the
Gini coefficient, we know that a less socially-segmented society must result in a lower
Gini. 3 Thus, IPF is indeed a frontier.

2

The IPF concept was first introduced in Milanovic (2006).

3

The reader can verify this by letting one subsistence worker’s income rise above subsistence to 20, and by
letting the richest person’s income be reduced to 1000. The new Gini would be 49.49.

7

The inequality possibility frontier can be derived more formally. Define
s=subsistence minimum, μ=overall mean income, N=number of people in a society, and
ε=proportion of people belonging to a (very small) upper class. Then the mean income of
upper class people (yh) will be

yh =

μN − sN (1 − ε ) 1
= [ μ − s (1 − ε )]
εN
ε

(1)

where we assume as before that the (1-ε)N people belonging to lower classes receive
subsistence incomes.
Once we document population proportions and mean incomes for both classes,
and assume further that all members in a given class receive the same income, 4 we can
calculate any standard measure of inequality from the distribution data. Here we shall
derive the IPF using the Gini coefficient.
The Gini coefficient for n social classes whose mean incomes (y) are ordered in
an ascending fashion (yj>yi), with subscripts denoting social classes, can be written as in
equation (2)

G = ∑ Gi piπi +
i =1

(2)

where πi=proportion of income received by i-th social class, pi=proportion of people
belonging to i-th social class, Gi=Gini inequality among people belonging to i-th social
class, and L=the overlap term which is greater than 0 only if there are members of a
lower social class (i) whose incomes exceed that of some members of a higher social
class (j). The first term on the right-hand side of equation (2) is the within component
(part of total inequality due to inequality within classes), the second term is the between
4

This is already assumed for the lower classes, but that assumption will be relaxed later for the upper
classes.

8

component (part of inequality due to differences in mean incomes between classes) and L
is, as already explained, the overlap term.
Continuing with our illustrative case, where all members of the two social classes
(upper and lower) have the mean incomes of their respective classes, equation (2)
simplifies to
G=

1

μ

( yj − yi ) pi p j

(3)

Substituting (1) for the income of the upper class, and s for the income of lower class, as
well as their population shares, (3) becomes
G* =

1 ⎡1
(μ − s(1 − ε ) ) − s ⎤⎥ε (1 − ε )
⎢
μ ⎣ε
⎦

(4)

where G* denotes the maximum feasible Gini coefficient for a given level of mean
income (μ). Rearranging terms in (4), we simplify
G* =

1− ε

μ

[(μ − s(1 − ε ) ) − sε ] = 1 − ε ( μ − s)
μ

(5)

Finally, if we now express mean income as a multiple of the subsistence minimum, μ=αs
(where α≥1), then (5) becomes
G* =

1− ε
α −1
s (α − 1) =
(1 − ε )
αs
α

(6)

Equation (6) represents our final expression for the maximum Gini which will
chart IPF as α is allowed to increase from 1 to higher values. For example, when α=1 (all
individuals receive the same income), (6) reduces to 0 (as we would expect), while when
α=2, the maximum Gini becomes 0.5(1-ε). Let the percentage of population that belongs
to the upper class be one-tenth of 1 percent (ε=0.001). Then for α=2, the maximum Gini

9

will be 49.95 (expressed as a percentage). 5 The hypothetical IPF curve generated for α
values ranging between 1 and 5 is shown in Figure 1.
[Figure 1 about here]
The derivative of the maximum Gini with respect to mean income (given a fixed
subsistence) is
dG * 1 − ε ⎛ α − 1 ⎞ 1 − ε

⎜1 −
⎟=
α ⎝
α ⎠ α2
dα

(7)

In other words, the IPF curve is increasing and concave. Using (7), one can easily
calculate the elasticity of G* with respect to α as 1/(α-1). That is, the percentage change
in the maximum Gini in response to a given percentage change in mean income is less at
higher levels of mean income.
The inequality possibility frontier depends on two parameters, α and ε. In the
illustrative example used here, we have assumed that ε=0.1 percent. How sensitive is our
Gini maximum to this assumption? Were the membership of the upper class even more
exclusive, consisting of (say) 1/50th of one percent of population, would the maximum
Gini change dramatically? Taking the derivative of G* with respect to ε in equation (6),
we get
dG * 1 − α
=
<0
dε
α

(8)

Thus, as ε falls (the club gets more exclusive), G* rises. But is the response big? Given
the assumption that mean income is twice subsistence and that the share of the top
income class is ε=0.001, we have seen that the maximum Gini is 49.95. But if we assume
instead that the top income group is cut to one-fifth of its previous size (ε=1/50 of one
5

As the percentage of people in top income class tends toward 0, G* tends toward (α-1)/α. Thus, for
example, for α=2, G* would be 0.5 (or 50 percent).

percent), the Gini will increase to 49.99, or hardly at all. G* is, of course, bounded by 50.
For historically plausible parameters, the IPF Gini is not very sensitive to changes in the
size of the top income class.
The assumption that all members of the upper class receive the same income is
convenient for the derivation of the IPF, but would its relaxation make a significant
difference in the calculated G*? To find out, we need to go back to the general Gini
formula given in (2). The within-group Gini for the upper class will no longer be equal to
0. 6 The overall Gini will increase by επhGh where h is the subscript for the upper (high)
class. The income share appropriated by the upper class is

π h = 1−

and the increase in the overall G* will therefore be

(9)

This increase is unlikely to be substantial. Consider again our illustrative example
where α=2 and ε=0.001. The multiplication of the last two terms in (9) equals 0.0005.
Even if the Gini among upper classes is increased to 50, the increase in the overall Gini
(ΔG*) will be only 0.025 Gini points. We conclude that we can safely ignore the
inequality among the upper class in our derivation of the maximum Gini. Inequality
among the upper class is unlikely to make much difference since the assumed size of the
top income group is so small to start with. Thus, we think within-group inequality can be
safely ignored for IPF estimates since almost the entire inequality is due to the between-

group Gini component. 7 This inference should not imply a disinterest in actual
distribution at the top; indeed, we will assess the empirical support for it in section 4.

3. Social Tables and Inequality Measures

Income distribution data based on household surveys are, of course, unavailable
for pre-industrial societies. The earliest household surveys of income and expenditures
date from the late eighteenth century in England and the mid nineteenth century in other
countries. We believe that the best estimates of ancient inequalities can be obtained from
what are called social tables (or, as William Petty (1676) called it more than three
centuries ago, political arithmetick) where various social classes are ranked from the
richest to the poorest with their estimated population (family or household head) shares
and average incomes. Social tables are particularly useful in evaluating ancient societies
where classes were clearly delineated and the differences in mean incomes between them
were substantial. Theoretically, if class alone determined one’s income, and if differences
in income within classes were small, then all inequality would be explained by the
between-class inequality. One of the best examples of social tables is offered by Gregory
King’s famous estimates for England and Wales in 1688 (Barnett 1936; Lindert and
Williamson 1982). King’s list of classes summarized in Table 1 is fairly detailed (31
social classes). King (and others listed in Table 1) did not report inequalities within each
social class so we cannot identify within-class inequality for 1688 England and Wales or
for any other of the Table 1 observations. However, within-class inequalities can be
7

Moreover, in the empirical work below, we shall be using mean incomes of social classes to calculate the
estimates of ancient inequalities, thus making an assumption equivalent to the one made in the derivation of
the inequality possibility frontier.

12

roughly gauged by calculating two Gini values: a lower bound Gini1 which estimates
only the between-group inequality and assumes within-group or within-social class
inequality to be zero; an upper bound Gini2 which estimates the maximum inequality that
is compatible with the grouped data from social tables assuming that all individuals from
a higher social group are richer than any individual from a lower social group. In other
words, where class mean incomes are such that yj>yi, it also holds true that ykj>ymi for all
members of group j, where k and m are subscripts that denote individuals. Thus, in
addition to the between-class inequality component, Gini2 includes some within-class
inequality (see equation 2), but under the strong assumption that mean incomes for all
members of a given social class are poorer or richer than those respectively above or
below them. This strong assumption is unlikely to be fulfilled in any actual social table,
but it allows us to move beyond an accounting limited only to between-class inequality. 8
In the empirical work that follows, we shall depend almost entirely on social tables or tax
census data obtained from secondary sources, including some estimates of our own.
Detailed explanations for each country’s social table are provided in the Appendix 1.
[Table 1 about here]
Table 1 lists 14 ancient pre-industrial societies for which we have calculated
inequality statistics. 9 These societies range from early first-century Rome (Augustan
Principate) to India just prior to its independence from Britain. Assuming with Angus
8

Gini2 is routinely calculated when published income distribution data are only reported as fractiles of the
population and their income shares are the only data given. In that case, of course, any member of a richer
group must have a higher income than any member of a lower group. This is unlikely to be satisfied when
the fractiles are not income classes but rather social classes as is the case here. The Gini2 formula is due to
Kakwani (1980).

9

Joseph Massie’s famous social tables for 1759 England and Wales are not used here since he did not give
them in a form consistent with our needs. In addition, we excluded 1752 Jerez (Andalusia) since it was
primarily an urban observation. In the near future, we expect to augment the sample by adding 1861 Chile,
1924 Java, late Tokugawa and early Meiji Japan, 1427 Tuscany, 1788 France, Tsarist Russia and others.

13

Maddison an annual subsistence minimum of $PPP 400 per capita, 10 and with GDI per
capita ranging from about $PPP 500 to $PPP 2,000, then α would range from 1.3 to 5. A
GDI per capita of $PPP 2,000 is a level of income not uncommon today, and it would
place 1732 Holland or 1801-03 England and Wales in the 40th percentile in the world
distribution of countries by per capita income in the year 2000. With the possible
exception of 1732 Holland and 1801-3 England, countries in our sample have average
incomes that are roughly compatible with contemporary pre-industrial societies that have
not yet started significant and sustained industrialization. The urbanization rate in our
sample ranges from less than 10 to 45 percent (the latter, again, for Holland). Population
size varies even more, from an estimated 983,000 in 1561 Holland to 350 million or more
in India 1947 and China 1880. Finally, the number of social classes into which
distributions are divided, and from which we calculate our Ginis, varies considerably.
They number only three for 1784-99 Nueva España (comprising the territories of today’s
Mexico, Central America, Cuba and parts of the western United States) and 1880 China.
In most cases, the number of social classes is in the double digits. The largest number is
in Brazil, where the data from the 1872 Brazilian census include 813 occupations.
The estimated inequality statistics are reported in Table 2. The calculated Ginis
display a very wide range: from 23.9 in 1880s China to 63.5 in 1784-99 Nueva España.
The latter figure is higher than the inequality reported for some of today’s most unequal
countries like Brazil and South Africa (Table 2). The average Gini (using Gini2 where
available, otherwise Gini1) from these 14 data points is 45.7, while the average Gini from
the nine modern comparators is 43.3. These are only samples, of course, but there is very
little difference on average between them, 45.7 (ancient) - 43.3 (modern) = 2.4. In
10

All dollar data, unless indicated otherwise, are in 1990 Geary-Khamis PPPs.

14

contrast, there are very great differences within each sample: 58.8 (Brazil 2002) - 27.3
(Sweden 2000) = 31.5 among the modern comparators, while 63.5 (Nueva España 178499) - 24.5 (China 1880) = 39 among the ancient economies. In short, inequality
differences within the ancient and modern samples is many times greater than the
difference between them.
The Gini estimates are plotted in Figure 2 against the estimates of GDI per capita
on the horizontal axis. They are also displayed against the inequality possibility frontier
constructed on the assumption of a subsistence minimum of $PPP 400 (solid line). 11 In
most cases, the calculated Ginis lie fairly close to the IPF. In terms of absolute distance,
the countries falling farthest below the IPF curve are the most “modern” pre-industrial
economies: England and Wales in 1688 and 1801-3, and Holland in 1732. The maximum
possible Ginis in these cases range from 72 to 80 while the estimated Ginis are between
45 and 63. 12
[Table 2 and Figure 2 about here]
If we used Maddison’s subsistence level of $400, then four estimated Ginis would
be significantly greater than the maximum Gini (at their level of income) implied by the
IPF: three of these are based on data from India, and the fourth is from Nueva España. 13

11

This is based on Maddison’s (1998, p.12) assumed subsistence minimum. Note that a purely
physiological minimum “sufficient to sustain life with moderate activity and zero consumption of other
goods” (Bairoch 1993, p.106) was estimated by Bairoch to be $PPP 80 at 1960 prices. Using the US
consumer price index to convert Bairoch’s estimate to international dollars yields $PPP 355 at 1990 prices.
Maddison’s estimate allows in addition for expenses above the bare physiological minimum. Our minimum
is also consistent with the World Bank absolute poverty line which is 1.08 per day per capita in 1993 $PPP
(Chen and Ravallion 2007, p. 6). This works out to be about $PPP 365 per annum in 1990 international
prices. Another justification for a subsistence minimum between $PPP 350 and 400 was recently provided
by Becker, Philipson and Soares (2005), who, in calculation of multidimensional inequality (income times
life expectancy), use a calibration to transform these two variables into one.
12

Naples, with very low inequality, also lies deeply inside the Inequality possibility frontier.

13

The Old Castille is also slightly above the IPF.

15

Recalling our definition of the IPF, these four cases can only be explained by one or more
of these five possibilities: (i) a portion of the population cannot even afford the
subsistence minimum, (ii) the actual ε is much smaller than the assumed ε=0.001, (iii)
inequality within the rich classes is very large, (iv) our estimate of inequality is too high,
and/or (v) the subsistence minimum is overestimated. We have already analyzed and
dismissed the first three possibilities. The fourth possibility is unlikely: since our
estimates of inequality are based only on a few classes, they are likely to be biased
downwards, not upwards. The last possibility offers the more likely explanation. It could
well be that the subsistence minimum was less than $PPP 400 for some societies. 14 In
particular, this is likely to be the case for subtropical or tropical regions where calorie,
housing and clothing needs are considerably less than those in temperate climates.
Indeed, in his pioneering study of world incomes, Colin Clark (1957, pp. 18-23)
distinguished between international units (the early PPP dollar) and oriental units, the
dollar equivalents which presumably hold for Asia and other poor areas but not for the
rest of the world. If the true subsistence minimum is less than Maddison’s assumed value
of $PPP 400, the IPF would move upwards (see the new IPF shown by a broken line in
Figure 2). Thus, the average income of $PPP 800 would no longer be equivalent to 2
subsistence minima (α=2) but, assuming the subsistence minimum of $PPP 300, the mean
income of $PPP 800 would amount to α=2⅔. If the IPF is drawn under the s=300
assumption, it shifts the frontier upwards enough to encompass at or below it all our
estimated inequalities, with the possible (and modest) exceptions of Moghul India and
Nueva España.
14

Another possibility is that our Maddison-based estimates of mean incomes for these four cases are too
low. If that was true, all four points should be moved horizontally to the right, thus falling inside the IPF.

16

How do country inequality measures compare with the maximum feasible Ginis at
their estimated income levels? Call the ratio between the actual (measured using Gini2)
and the maximum feasible inequality the inequality extraction ratio, indicating how much
of the maximum inequality was actually extracted: the higher the inequality extraction
ratio, the more (relatively) unequal the society. 15 The median ratio in our sample is 94
percent, the mean 102 percent. The countries with the lowest ratios are 1811 Naples and
1688 England and Wales (60-62 percent).
The inequality possibility frontier allows us to better situate these estimates of
ancient inequality in modern experience. Using the same framework that we have just
applied to ancient societies, the bottom panel of Table 2 provides estimates of inequality
in several contemporary societies. Brazil and South Africa have often been cited as
examples of extremely unequal societies, both driven by long experience with racial
discrimination, tribal power and regional dualism. Indeed, both countries display Ginis
comparable to those of the most unequal pre-industrial societies included in our sample.
But Brazil and South Africa are several times richer than the richest pre-industrial society
in our sample. Consequently, the maximum feasible inequality is much higher than
anything we have seen in our ancient sample. Thus, the elite in both countries have
extracted only about two-thirds of their maximum feasible inequality, and their inequality
extraction ratios are about the same as what we found for the most egalitarian ancient
societies (1688 England and Wales, and 1811 Kingdom of Naples).
In the year 2000, countries near the world median GDI per capita (about $PPP
3,500) or near the world mean population-weighted GDI per capita (a little over $PPP
15

The term “relative” is used here, faute de mieux, to denote conventionally calculated inequality in
relation to maximum possible inequality at a given level of income; not whether the measure of inequality
itself is relative or absolute.

6,000), had maximum feasible Ginis of 89 and 93 respectively. The median Gini in
today’s world is about 35, having thus extracted just a bit over a third of feasible
inequality, vastly less than did ancient societies. Using this measure, China’s present
inequality extraction ratio is 47 percent, while that for the United States is 41 percent,
and that for Sweden 28 percent. Only in the extremely poor countries today, with GDI
per capita less than $PPP 600, do actual and maximum feasible Ginis lie close together
(2003 Nigeria, 2004 Congo D. R., and 2000 Tanzania). Thus, while inequality in
historical pre-industrial societies is equivalent to that of today’s pre-industrial societies,
ancient inequality was much greater when expressed in terms of maximum feasible
inequality. Compared with the maximum inequality possible, today’s inequality is much
smaller than that of ancient societies.
Our new measure of inequality (the inequality extraction ratio) may possibly
reflect more accurately societal inequality, and the role it plays, than does any actual
measure. This new view of inequality may be more pertinent for the analysis of power in
both ancient and modern societies. For example, Tanzania (denoted TZA in Figure 3)
with a relatively low Gini of 35 may be less egalitarian than it appears since measured
inequality lies so close to (or indeed above) its inequality possibility frontier (Table 2 and
Figure 3). On the other hand, with a much higher Gini of almost 48, Malaysia (MYS) has
extracted only about one-half of maximum inequality, and thus is farther away from the
IPF.
[Table 2 and Figure 3 about here]
Another implication of our approach is that it considers jointly inequality and

18

development. As a country becomes richer, its feasible inequality expands. Consequently,
if recorded inequality is stable, the inequality extraction ratio must fall; and even if
recorded inequality goes up, the ratio may not. This can be seen in Figure 4 where we
plot the inequality extraction ratio against GDI per capita. Thus, the social consequences
of increased inequality may not entail as much relative impoverishment, or as much
perceived injustice, as might appear if we looked only at the recorded Gini. This logic is
particularly compelling for poor and middle-income countries where increases in income
push the maximum feasible inequality up relatively sharply, since the IPF curve is
concave. The farther a society rises above the subsistence minimum, the less will
economic development lift its inequality possibility frontier, and thus the inequality
extraction ratio will be driven more and more by the rise in the Gini itself. This is best
illustrated by the United States where the maximum feasible inequality already stands at
a Gini of 98.2. Economic development offers this positive message: the inequality
extraction ratio will fall with GDI per capita growth even if measured inequality remains
constant. However, economic decline offers the opposite message: that is, a decline in
GDI per capita, like that registered by Russia in the early stages of its transition from
Communism, drives the country’s maximum feasible inequality down. If the measured
Gini had been stable, the inequality extraction ratio would have risen. If the measured
Gini rose (as was indeed the case in Russia), the inequality extraction ratio would have
risen even more sharply. Rising inequality may be particularly socially disruptive under
these conditions.

4. Looking at Different Parts of the Income Distribution

How much of the inequality observed in ancient societies can be explained by the
economic distance between the rural landless poor at the bottom and the rich landed elite
at the top? How much can be explained by the distribution among the elite at the top?
How much by the share of that elite in the total?

Life at the Top: Income Distribution among the Elite

An impressive amount of recent empirical work has suggested that the evolution
of the share of the top 1 percent yields a good approximation to changes in the overall
income distribution in modern industrial societies (Piketty 2003, 2005; Piketty and Saez
2003, 2006; Atkinson and Piketty forthcoming). These studies find that most of the action
takes place at the top of the income distribution pyramid and that differences in the top 1
percent income share account for much of the differences in overall inequality. These top
share studies have also been performed on poor pre-modern India (since 1922: Banerjee
and Piketty 2005), Indonesia (since 1920: Leigh and van der Eng 2006) and Japan (since
1885: Moriguchi and Saez 2005), but it is important to stress that they do not find this
result, but rather assume it. So, are differences in the share of the top 1 percent also a
good proxy for differences in overall income distribution in ancient pre-industrial
societies?
The share of top 1 percent is estimated here under the assumption that top
incomes follow a Pareto distribution. Our approach is basically the same as that recently
used by Atkinson (forthcoming) and by others writing before him (see the references in

20

Atkinson). The estimation procedure is explained in detail in Appendix 3 where several
caveats are listed since our social tables are different from the usual income distribution
data sources.
Table 3 reports two key results: the estimated income share of the top 1 percent of
recipients, and the cut-off point, that is the income level (relative to the mean) where the
top one percent of recipients begins. The countries are listed in descending order
according to the top 1 percent share. In sharp contrast with modern studies, the
correlation between the top 1 percent share and the Gini is negative, small (-0.13), and
statistically insignificant. This implies that differences in the top percentile share do not
reflect differences in overall inequality very well, a result consistent with what we report
on the average income to rural wage ratio below. Consider, for example, the Roman and
Byzantine empires. Their estimated Ginis are very similar (39.4 and 41) but the top
percentile share in Byzantium (30.6, the highest in our sample) is almost twice as great as
in Rome (16.1). Consider another top-heavy society like China in 1880 where the top
percentile share of 21.3 is second only to Byzantine 1000, but where the Gini is the
lowest in the sample (24.5).
[Table 3 and Figure 5 about here]
The location of the cut-off point -- where the top percentile begins -- tells us a lot
about the organization of societies. Figure 5 displays the top percentile share and the cutoff point (relative to mean income). At one end of the spectrum is the Byzantine Empire
with a very rich top one percent, but also with an unusually low cut-off point. This would
seem to indicate the absence of a middle class, that is, of those who would normally fill
in the “space” between the mean income and (say) an income 3 to 4 times greater than

21

the mean. The results for China display the same pattern. 16 On the other hand, the top
percentile was very rich in the Roman Empire (16.1 percent of total income), but the cutoff point was very high too: 12.4 times the mean. This suggests a Roman income
distribution with a long tail of rich people such that the 2nd-5th percentiles were also quite
rich. This interpretation is supported by Figure 6 which shows the empirical income
distributions and the estimated top percentile share calculated using the Pareto
interpolation (see the dashed line). 17 While the income share after the first, and up to the
4th and the 5th percentile in Byzantium rises very slowly, the line rises more steeply in
Rome, indicating that Romans in these percentiles were relatively wealthy. For
comparative purposes, we also show the English 1801-3 data where the top 1 percent
share, as well as the steepness of the line after the top percentile, are similar to those of
Rome. It seems that the main difference among the very rich in Rome 14 and England
1801-3 was that the people just below the very top of the income pyramid were, relative
to the mean, somewhat less rich in England than in Rome. Finally, notice that in all three
cases, the top 5 percent of income recipients received between 30 and just over 40
percent of total income. In contrast, the top 5 percent received about a quarter of total
income in modern United States and United Kingdom, while the share is 27 percent in
modern Chile and a third in Brazil.
Table 3 also reports several modern comparators. In all cases but one (Mexico),
their top 1 percent share is less, and for most cases, much less, than that estimated for our

16

The Chinese result is driven in part by the available data which focus on the income of Chinese gentry,
the top 2 percent of the population.
17

Note that the high intercept of the line indicates a very high income share of the very top (people even
richer than the top 1 percent).

22

sample of ancient societies. The low top 1 percent share combined with a low cut-off
point (characteristic of advanced societies) betokens a distribution where, first, the richest
1 percent are not extravagantly rich (in contrast with the American Bill Gates or the
Roman Marcus Licinus Crassus), and where, second, they are not very different from the
rest of the population. Since we have already noted that Gini coefficients between the
ancient and contemporary poor societies are not very different, this difference in the
average top 1 percent shares between the ancient and modern implies that the link
between top income share and overall inequality is not very strong among ancient
societies.

Life at the Bottom: The Unskilled Rural Wage Relative to Average Income

For eleven of the fourteen countries in our ancient inequality sample, we can
measure the economic distance between the landed elite and landless labor by computing
the ratio of average family income (or average income per recipient, y) to that of landless,
unskilled rural laborer (w). Figure 7 plots the relation between the overall Gini and the
y/w ratio (Appendix 2). 18 The simple bivariate correlation is positive (standard errors in
parentheses):
Gini =

29.79 + 6.27 y/w, R2 = 0.51
(4.83) (3.04)

(n = 11)

The estimated relationship also implies an elasticity of the Gini with respect to the y/w
ratio of 0.4. For every 10 percent increase in y/w, the Gini rose by 4 percentage points.
Low measured inequalities in China 1880 and Naples 1811 (Ginis of 24.2 and 28.3) were
consistent with small gaps between poor rural laborers and average incomes (y/w of 1.32
18

This simple y/w index has been shown to be a good proxy for inequality among nineteenth and twentieth
century poor economies (Williamson 1997, 2002).

23

and 1.49), or with a rural wage two-thirds to three-quarters of average income. High
measured inequalities in Nueva España 1784-99 and England 1801-03 (Ginis of 63.5 and
51.5) were consistent with large gaps between poor rural laborers and average incomes
(y/w of 2.94 and 4.17), or with a rural wage only one-quarter to one-third of average
income. There appears to be only one true outlier to the otherwise tight relationship in
Figure 7, British India in 1947. Still, the overall relationship does suggest that the gap
between poor landless labor and the landed elite, whose incomes raise the average
considerably, drives the Gini, not conditions at the top.

5. Unequal Life Expectancy and Lifetime Incomes

Thus far, this paper has followed convention by considering inequality of annual
income. Yet, differences in the ability to consume should be gauged by lifetime income,
not just annual income. The fact that some die much younger than others matters in
gauging inequality, and it matters even more if morbidity and mortality are correlated, so
that short lives are also low quality lives. How are comparisons between ancient and
modern pre-industrial societies affected when we adjust for inequality in life expectancy?
We are interested in two concepts of life expectancy inequality: inequality in
group survival rates, and inequality in individual survival rates. The first speaks to
debates over the injustice of the rich living longer, while the second speaks to debates
about the distribution of individual income and consumption. We think it is useful to
measure historical movements in both kinds of life expectancy inequality, even without
trying to tote up lifetime consumption levels.

24

Public interest in group survival rates tends to focus on differences between
nations, social classes, and genders. 19 The difference in average survival between nations
first rose and then fell over the last five hundred years. Before the sixteenth century, the
average life span from birth was in the 21-29 year range the world over. Subsequently,
western Europeans began to undergo an increase in life spans beyond 30 years while the
rest of the world continued to die younger. This gap between longer-living rich countries
and others continued to widen until the early twentieth century, thus causing world
lifetime income inequality to rise more steeply than world annual income inequality.
Over the past century, the life span gap between poor and rich countries has narrowed
dramatically. Despite current concern about infectious diseases in poor countries, the fact
is that spectacular progress has already been made there.
The resulting transformation in international inequalities is illustrated by Figure 8,
which plots average life expectancies at birth (e0) against GDP per capita. The two e0
curves with black markers trace out long histories for England and Wales (later, the
United Kingdom) since the late sixteenth century and France since the early eighteenth
century. British and French citizens, and those in the rest of Western Europe, were, of
course, much richer and lived much longer than their distant ancestors. The same has also
been true of the Japanese since the early nineteenth century, even though they have
always lived longer than Western Europeans at similar incomes. The distinction between

19

On the gender front, we will only note that since about 1800, females have outlived males throughout the
world. Before then, the gender life balance could tip either way. Males outlived females in some, but not
all, of the pre-1800 averages for China, Japan, England, and Scandinavia. The global shift toward relatively
longer-lived females is probably explained largely by the decline in female infanticide and in maternal
deaths during childbirth.

25

shifts in the e0 curve in Figure 8 and movements along it is important. 20 It is far harder to
argue that shifts in the curve are driven by improvements in living standards than for
movements along it (Preston 1980; Williamson 1984). While we know a great deal about
the connections between individual living standards and longevity along the e0 curve
(Fogel 2004), we know far less about the public health forces accounting for the shift in
the e0 curve.
The most dramatic historical shift in international survival rates, however, has
taken place in today’s developing countries, seven of which are portrayed in Figure 8.
People in today’s poor countries live much longer than did Western Europeans before the
twentieth century, at comparable income levels. For example, at the end of the twentieth
century China had an average life expectancy of almost 70 years, compared with 47 years
for the French in 1900 who received comparable real incomes. Similarly, Africans south
of the Sahara survive a bit longer today (e0 = 47 years, even including the impact of
AIDS), than did the English in the early nineteenth century when they had the world’s
longest life spans (e0 = 45 years). The global spread of better health care and public
victories over many pathogens and parasites in the twentieth century created a dramatic
life expectancy convergence between nations. Thus, we now live in a world where
nations no longer differ anywhere near as much in life expectancies than they did a
century ago. What separates nations today is the quality of life, not the length of life
(Clark 2007, p. 108). What separated them a century ago was both.
Group survival rates were always correlated with average incomes in the past. We
have not yet found any century in which the poor out-lived the rich (apart from episodes
20

The upward shift over time in the e0 curve was emphasized by Samuel Preston (1980).

26

of civil violence and war), while there are plenty of historical examples where the rich
out-lived the poor. Thus, in Roman Italy two millennia ago, adult mortality was worse for
former slaves than for magistrates. 21 Several estimates from early modern Europe show
that aristocrats outlived commoners, especially female aristocrats. The same correlation
with socio-economic status persists today, both for infant and adult mortality, even in
countries with comprehensive national health services. While survival rate gaps between
different socio-economic groups may have been eternal, we lack enough evidence to say
exactly when they widened or narrowed.
Survival inequalities across individuals deserve at least as much attention as
survival inequalities across classes or nations. History offers two clear insights on the
issue. First, inequality among individual lifetime incomes has always been greater than
inequality among individual annual incomes. Second, the historical trend in the inequality
of lifetime incomes must have been sharply downward to the extent that those five
hundred years of improvement in life spans illustrated in Figure 8 were driven in large
part by improvements in infant and child survival. For example, infant mortality in Africa
south of the Sahara today is only 10 percent, while it was over 12 percent in the United
States in 1900 and 17 percent in England in the late eighteenth century.
People today in modern pre-industrial societies are endowed with much more
equal life span (and morbidity) chances than were their distant ancestors in ancient preindustrial societies. It follows that lifetime-adjusted inequality is a lot less in today’s preindustrial societies.

21

This point has been previously noted by Jackson (1994) and Hoffman et al. (2005).

27

The trend toward more equal survival rates has an interesting East Asian twist.
Ancient China and Japan both had higher infant mortality than did the rest of the world,
but children also had better survival chances after infancy, so that until the late eighteenth
century overall life expectancy at birth was as good in East Asia as in Europe and even
England. This demographic fact has had two important implications for the long-run
evolution of East Asian inequality. First, those suggestions of ancient East Asian
egalitarianism in Table 2 and Figure 2 were offset by highly unequal survival chances for
East Asian newborns. Second, the twentieth century convergence in life expectancies was
more dramatic for East Asia than it was for the rest of the Third World. For example, the
share of Japanese infants dying in the first year of life dropped from 25 percent in 17761815, to 5 percent in the early 1950s, and to only 0.4 percent today. Ancient East Asia
has moved from being relatively equal in income, but relatively unequal in life span, to
being relatively equal in both today.

6. New Inequality Insights and an Agenda for the Future

We conclude by stressing three key aspects of inequality that ancient preindustrial experience has uncovered. First, as measured by the Gini coefficient, income
inequality in still-pre-industrial countries today is not very different from inequality in
distant pre-industrial times. In addition, the variance between countries then and now is
much greater than the variance in average inequality between then and now. Second, the
extraction ratio – how much of potential inequality was converted into actual inequality –
was significantly bigger then than now. We are persuaded that much more can be learned

28

about inequality in the past and the present by looking at the extraction ratio rather than
just at actual inequality. The ratio shows how powerful and extortionary are the elite, its
institutions, and its policies. For example, in a regression using ancient inequality
evidence (not included in the text) a dummy variable for colony has a strong positive
impact on the extraction ratio. Furthermore, while a relation between conflict and actual
inequality has proven hard to document on modern evidence (see Collier and Hoeffler,
2004), we conjecture that the introduction of the inequality possibility frontier and the
extraction ratio might shed brighter light on that hypothesis. Third, differences in lifetime
survival rates between rich and poor countries and between rich and poor individuals
within countries were much higher two centuries ago than they are now, and this served
to make for greater lifetime inequality in the past. Fourth, unlike the findings regarding
the evolution of the 20th century inequality in advanced economies, our ancient inequality
sample does not reveal any significant correlation between the income share of the top 1
percent and overall inequality. Thus, an equally high Gini could and was achieved in two
ways: in some societies, a high income share of the elite coexisted with a yawning gap
between it and the rest of society, and small differences in income amongst the non-elite;
in other societies, the very top of income pyramid was followed by only slightly less rich
people and then further down toward something that resembled a middle class. Why were
some ancient societies more hierarchal while others were more socially diverse? While
this paper has focused on inequality description in ancient societies, it has not explored
the social structure underpinning inequality or its determinants.
We hope to fill these social structure blanks in a sequel to this paper. In addition,
the sequel, with an augmented ancient inequality sample, will explore determinants of

29

actual inequality and the extraction ratio. Three forces are likely to explain most of the
variance in an augmented ancient inequality sample. First, initial resource endowments
should matter, especially for ancient agricultural settlements. Different endowments
imply different food crops, and different food crops imply different technologies. Some
agrarian technologies imply constant returns (rice) and some increasing returns (wheat).
The difference may matter for the inequality configuration of ancient inequalities.
Second, whether the country is the colonizer or the colonized should matter. Throughout
history, colonial powers have ruled by rewarding indigenous elites, not by mollifying the
masses. Third, a mixture of political and market forces must have been at work,
especially the former. More political power and patronage implies more inequality. The
frequent claim that inequality promotes accumulation and growth does not get much
support from history. On the contrary, great economic inequality has always been
correlated with extreme concentration of political power, and that power has always been
used to widen the income gaps through rent-seeking and rent-keeping, forces that
demonstrably retard economic growth. 22

For a theoretical restatement and fresh international evidence on the growth costs of unequal political
power, see Glaeser, Scheinkman, and Shleifer (2003).

Income distribution data. The occupational data come from the Brazilian 1872 Census.
The annual incomes by occupation were estimated by the team of economic historians
Bértola, Castelnovo, Reis and Willebald (2006). The original data include 813
professional groups. For simplicity they are consolidated in the table shown above:
different professions with the same estimated income are summed up.
Population and area. Current land area of Brazil. Population from Maddison (2004).

Urbanization rate. The 1872 urbanization rate (share of cities 50,000 or greater) is 5.1
precent, interpolated from Banks (1976).
Mean income in $PPP. From Maddison (2004).

Notes: Nobility includes civil and military nobility. The average household size estimated at 4.3 (see
Lefort, 2002).

Income distribution data. Taken directly from Milanovic (2006: Table 5, p. 465). Rural
incomes are based mostly on Lefort (2002) who quantifies population shares and incomes
of several classes; rural population is divided into tenants (pariokoi); farmers that include
both landowning peasants and (not very numerous) hired farm workers and slaves working
on large estates; and large landowners. Urban population is, following Morrisson and
Cheney (2002), divided into four classes plus nobility (both civilian and military).

Income distribution data. The calculations are based on Supplement 2 (“The gentry's
share in the national product”) from The Income of the Chinese Gentry, by Chung-li
Chang, University of Washington Press, Seattle 1962, pp. 326-333.

Gentry per capita incomes. The supplement provides a careful breakdown of
gentry incomes by different sources, division of these income sources between upper and
lower gentry, and the population shares of both types of gentry (see the table below
which is derived from Chang’s Supplement 2). The rest of the book gives the data on
Chinese GDP and taxes from which one can calculate total household disposable income,
and when combining this information with the estimates of gentry total income and its
share in the Chinese population, calculate gentry’s (upper’s and lower’s) per capita
incomes (see the last line in the table below).
Main sources of gentry income, according to Chang, are:
(i) Government office-holding (administration) which was confined to gentry
only. Income from government jobs provided resources for purchase of land and thus
income from landownership. Land was a much less important source of income than at a
similar stage in European history.
(ii) Gentry service in local affairs (managerial income); basically local
administration.
(iii) Assistants to officials (secretarial services).
(iv) Teaching. Unlike the first three, they are private services. Only higher
education (teaching) was monopolized by the gentry.
(v) Other services include medicine, writing etc. They are of much smaller
importance.
In professions (i) to (iii) actual incomes (as calculated by Chang) were several
times larger than the official wages. It was a policy to keep official wages low and give
large premiums (the yang-lien allowance, see Chang p.13).
Commoners’ per capita incomes. Once gentry per capita incomes are derived,
commoners’ incomes are obtained as the residual (using total household disposable
income, line d in Table below, minus gentry’s total income, and dividing by commoners’
total population). The estimated commoners’ per capita income of 4.92 taels should be

contrasted with the estimated subsistence minimum (based on wage data) which was
between 5 and 6 taels (Chang). If we consider Maddison's (2004) estimated China GDI
per capita of $PPP 540 and Chang's average income of 6.5 taels to be the same (as they
should be), then the subsistence minimum of $400 works out to be 4.8 taels. This
indirectly obtained subsistence minimum is quite close to the directly calculated one
(from Chang) of 5 to 6 taels per annum. This further corroborates both the subsistence
minimum and the average figures.

King’s social table (available at
http://www.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/fzlinder/King1688revised.htm). The data which

Urbanization rate. Bairoch (1985: Table 13/1, p. 279) gives the year 1700 range (based
on cities greater than 5,000) to be 13 to 16 percent. For 1688, we have used the lower
bound of the range (13 percent).
Mean income in $PPP. Obtained by interpolation from Maddison’s (2001, p. 247)
estimates of English and Welsh GDI per capita in 1600 and 1700. An alternative
calculation based directly on King’s estimates yield almost the same result. If we take
the ratio between the mean income from King’s social table (9.6 pounds per capita per
annum) and the subsistence minimum assumed to be one-third above the vagrants’
income (2.7 pounds), we get a mean income which is 3.5 times the subsistence which,
combined with the subsistence minimum of $PPP 400, yields an average income of
$PPP 1400. The interpolation based on Maddison’s data is $PPP 1418.

Holland 1561 and 1732
Income distribution data: The rental values of all dwellings (including the poor) were
taxed. We know that dwelling rents were highly correlated with income (Williamson
1985; van den Berg and van Zanden, 1988: pp. 193-215), but we also know that the
elasticity of rents to income was less than one (between 0.72 and 0.75 in 1852-1910
Britain: Williamson 1985, p. 225). Thus, income inequality should be understated by
rental values. With that understood, the source of the Dutch data is van Zanden (1995).
We have not yet been able to secure the underlying distribution data from the author.
Population and area: Population is interpolated between 1500 and 1600 (983,176), and
between 1700 and 1820 (2,002.783), from Maddison (2001). We approximate the area of
21,680 km2 to be modern Holland.
Urbanization rate: For 1561, the urbanization estimate (45%) is from van Bavel and van
Zanden (2004). For 1732, the urbanization estimate (39%) is from de Vries (1985).
Mean income in $PPP: GDP per capita in 1990 international dollars interpolated
between 1500 and 1600, and between 1700 and 1820, from Maddison (2001: p. 264).

Note: Zemandars are large landowners. The data refer to the entire Indian subcontinent (today’s India,
Pakistan and Bangladesh).

Income distribution data. The source of both data is Maddison (2002) which is turn
based on Maddison (1971: pp. 33 and 69). Maddison (2002) gives only population and
income shares, but if we combine this information with Maddison’s own estimates of
GDI per capita for India (see below), we can calculate $PPP income estimates for each
social group. Indian Moghul data present a particular problem because there are only 4
social classes given. Since their incomes are vastly different, and the largest group (72
percent; village economy) is in the middle of income distribution, probably spanning
people with very different incomes, Gini2 is unusually some 27 percent higher than the
minimum Gini (G2 is 48.9 vs. Gini minimum 38.5). 23

Discussion: Note that a part (but only a part) of high Indian inequality around the time of
the independence from Great Britain is caused by very high incomes of the British in
India. According to Maddison, 0.06 percent of the population (British officials and
businessmen) received 5 percent of total income which made their average per capita
income more than $PPP 51,000 per year (and would place them in the top 5 percent of
23

today’s US income distribution). Yet, despite these incomes being extravagantly high,
this is only a part of the story since Gini without the British is still at a rather high level of
45 (as opposed to 48-49 with them). Consequently, the main cause of the very high
inequality is a very low income level of the poor classes (a point discussed in the main
text with regard to the appropriateness or not of using the subsistence minimum of $PPP
400).
One can also compare the without-the-British inequality in India in 1947 to the inequality
results derived from the first Indian National Sample Survey (NSS) conducted in 1951.
The expenditure-based NSS Gini is only 36. 24 So—(1) are expenditures significantly
more equally distributed, compared to income, than we would expect (a conventional
adjustment, suggested by Li, Squire and Zou (1998), is 5 to 6 Gini points while here the
difference is 9 Gini points), 25 or (2) is Maddison overestimating India’s 1947 inequality;
or (3) is he underestimating income of India’s poor, or (4) did inequality go down by
several Gini points between the end of the British raj and 1951?
Population and area. The Indian population in 1750 is estimated from Maddison (2003:
appendix HS-8, Table 8a, p. 256). Interpolation based on the data for 1700 and 1820. The
population for 1947 is taken directly from Maddison (2003). For both dates, the area
includes the entire Indian subcontinent (today’s India, Pakistan and Bangladesh).
Urbanization rate. For 1750, from Bergier and Matthieu (2002: Table 1, original
sources given there). Obtained by interpolation from the urbanization rates of the Indian
subcontinent of 11-13 % in 1700 and 9-12% in 1800. The paper available at
http://eh.net/XIIICongress/cd/papers/33BergierMathieu422.pdf#search=%22urbanization
%20rate%20british%20india%22. For 1947, obtained as interpolation between the
urbanization rate of 14.1% in 1941 and 17.6% in 1951; see Mohan (1985: Table 1, p.
621).
Mean income in $PPP. From Maddison (2004), “World population, GDP and per capita
GDP, 1-2000 AD”, available at http://www.ggdc.net/Maddison/content.shtml. For around
1750, we assume the same income as in 1820 (the first year in Maddison’s series). For
1947, the value is taken directly from Maddison (2004).

And it could easily be argued that the difference ought to be less since data from social tables are very
rough in that they assign the same income for an entire class of people and do not allow for the fact that
some people from a mean-poorer class may have higher incomes than some people from a mean-richer
class.

Income distribution data. The source is Malanima (2006: p. 31), who uses the tax census

data from 1811. This tax census is, for the purposes of establishing an estimate of income
distribution, better than others because it surveyed not only tax paying units but also the
poor (the indigent). Each of the 14 provinces of the Kingdom was supposed to place
people in predetermined nine categories, running from the poorest to the richest (by
family income). The percentage of people placed in each category was “free” (that is, left
to each village, city etc.) with the only stipulation that not more than one-sixth of the
population may be placed in the bottom category (the “indigent”) and hence be exempt
from taxation. The problem is that it imposes an equality of conditions across provinces
and leads to an underestimation of incomes in the rich areas like Naples-city. For
example, people with a same income may be placed in category III in Naples and in
higher category IV in a poorer province. Similarly, the number of poor in Naples (which
was probably high) might have been underestimated (because of the imposed threshold of
one-sixth). Yet, with the exception of the Naples-city (then the third largest European
city containing about 6 percent of the total Kingdom’s population), which also displayed
relatively high inequality, 26 income differences between the provinces were too small to
lead to significant and systematic misplacing of households. The ratio of mean rural
incomes between the richest and poorest province was less than 1.5 to 1 (and rural
population accounted for 85% of the total population). 27
Another problem is that the authorities in each province might have been tempted to
underestimate people’s incomes and to push more people into lower classes so that taxes

The Gini given by Malanima (2006) is 53.
Excluding Naples-city, the same ratio for the urban areas is even narrower: 1.4 to 1 (calculated from

would be minimized. This is reflected in the fact that some 75 percent of families were
grouped in the second class (just above the indigent; see Malanima 2006, Table 3, p. 9). 28
Malanima, however, revises these original data, uses information about salaries and other
sources of income, and constructs a new distribution (which we use here) composed of
nine groups, each consisting of 10 percent of the population, and the top decile divided
into three groups (see Malanima 2006: Appendix). We thus obtain an income distribution
composed of twelve groups ranked by their estimated per capita income.

Mean income in $PPP. Obtained as the ratio between the mean income of the Kingdom
of Naples as calculated from Malanima data (65.8 ducats per capita per annum) and the
subsistence minimum (31 ducats per capita for a five-member family in rural areas, and
up to 50 ducats per capita in urban areas). Taking relative shares of urban and rural
populations (85 and 15 percent), we estimate the subsistence minimum at 35 ducats per
person annually. Mean income is thus 1.9 times the subsistence. Taking $PPP 400 for the
subsistence, results in mean income of $PPP 752. This can be contrasted with
Maddison’s (2004) estimate of Italy’s 1820 GDI per capita of $PPP 1117. Since
Kingdom of Naples was poorer than most of Italy (north of Naples), the difference seems
plausible.

It is notable however that the quota for the indigent which was 16.6 percent was not fulfilled: in total,
only 14.4 percent of families were placed in this group and thus tax-exempt.

Income distribution data. In 1813, Manuel Abad y Queipo, Bishop of Michoacán,
published his Colección. His social tables offer information on: family size; total
population; three income classes with population shares and income per capita for the
bottom two (the Spanish upper class 10% ; mestizo middle class 18% at 60 pesos; and
indigenous peasant class 72% at 12.2 pesos). What is missing to complete the crude size
distribution is either an estimate of average income per capita for the richest class or an
estimate of total income for Nueva España as a whole. Our estimates use an average of
the latter from three sources: Coatsworth’s 240 million pesos in 1800 (Coatsworth 1978
and 1989); Rosenzweig’s 190 million pesos in 1810 (Rosenzweig Hernández 1989); and
TePaske’s 251 million pesos in 1806 (TePaske 1985).
Population and area. Population estimate of 4,500,000 from Colección (1813). Modern
Mexican borders are used to define the area of 1,224,433 km2 since it appears that
Manuel Abad y Queipo ignored New Mexico and California.
Urbanization rate. Calculated from cities with 10,000 or more inhabitants from von
Humboldt (1822).
Mean income in $PPP: 1800 GDP per capita in 1990 international dollars (Coatsworth
2003 and 2005).

Income distribution data. The basis for calculations is provided by Goldsmith’s (1984)
estimates. Goldsmith provides minimum wealth (census qualification) for the three top
classes (senators, knights and municipal senators) and an estimate of their mean incomes.
The problem was that –taking these estimates as given, and assuming that the bulk of the
working population lived at slightly above the subsistence minimum ($PPP 400)—one
finds an overall lower mean income than given by Goldsmith and used here (HS 380).
This is why we introduced, following Goldsmith who spoke of that class but did not put
any numbers on it, a fourth rich class of “other rich people” who were neither Roman
knights nor municipal senators (both of which needed to fulfill the census requirements).
There is no doubt that that “fourth” rich class existed but putting a number on its size and
average income is obviously difficult. We decided to take as their mean income the
average of the two other higher classes’ incomes (leaving out as decidedly the richest the
class of Roman senators).

Notes to the table above
1/ From Goldsmith (1985). Total amount for senators includes HS15 million of
Augustus’ and Imperial households’ (100 people) private fortune. The censuses,
according to Goldsmith, were 1 milion for senators and 250,000 for the knights.
According to Finlay (p. 46), the census for the knights was 400,000 HS. The average
annual income of senators’ class is calculated to be 15 percent of the census (note: census
is the threshold) and for knights, 12 percent of the census amount.
2/ Calculated from Clark (p. 676): 225 denarii (1 denarius = 4 HS) plus 50 modii of
wheat valued at 110 HS (Milanovic, 2006, Table 3). This makes the average wheat price
2.2 HS per modius. Harl (p. 276) gives modius price range from 8 asses (2 HS) in Egypt
to 32 (8 HS) in Rome. Temin (2006, p. 138) gives free market price in Rome at 4-6 HS.
After the huge Rome’s fire in 64, Tacitus (Book XV, Chapter 39) mentions that the price
of wheat in Rome, due to the sudden impoverishment of the population, dropped to 3HS
per modius. We select a relatively low price to avoid inflating incomes by using Roman
prices for the goods that were essentially consumed outside the capital.
Tacitus (Book I, Chapter 17) quotes soldiers (in year 14) complaining that a
soldier is worth only 10 asses per day. That would be 2.5 HS per day or 912 HS per
annum, some 10 percent below our estimate of HS 1010. Tacitus’ number may refer to
the monetary pay only, i.e., it likely excludes payments in kind.
Size of the army (250,000) from Temin (2006, p. 147) quoting Goodman (1997).
Similarly, Walbank (p.19) gives 250-300,000.
3/ Clark (p. 676). The size of the Praetorian guard was 9 cohorts each with 1,000 men.
4/ From Milanovic (2006, Table 4), based on Goldsmith (1984, p. 268) and the amount of
alimenta paid from the public treasury to boys under 15 years of age.
5/ From Temin (2006, p. 136). We assume that their income was twice the subsistence.
They are assumed to account for 10 percent of the urban population.

6/ Lowest class according to Temin (2006). We assume their average income to be 30%
above the subsistence minimum. They account for more than 90 percent of the rural
population (which in turn accounts for 90 percent of the total population).
7/ Based on Goldsmith (3.5 HS per day times 225 working days). Temin (2006, p. 138)
gives also the average wage in Rome as 3-4 HS per day (see also Milanovic, 2006, Table
4 and the sources given there). Wages expressed at Rome-city prices (see discussion of
mean income below). Workers are estimated to account for 80 percent of urban
population.
8/ The legion's commander wage ratio (67 times ordinary soldier’s wage) is given in
Duncan-Jones (p. 116) who quotes Brunt (1950). The number of legion commanders
calculated by dividing 250,000 soldiers by the average size of a legion (5,000 men; for
the average size of the legion, see Duncan-Jones p. 215).
Discussion.
(1) Slaves and landowners. Slaves are not shown as a separate social category. This is
because their economic conditions covered practically the entire spectrum of incomes
(with a possible exception of the very top). Their consumption levels varied widely: they
ranged from being very rich (owning slaves themselves) to being very poor (mostly
slaves engaged in mining). Even rural slaves, who were on average worse-off than urban
slaves, were not just “all undifferentiated gang laborers; [on the contrary] there are lists
of rural slave jobs that are as varied as the known range of urban or household slave
jobs" (Temin, no date, p. 8). For the urban slaves, who were more numerous than rural
slaves, 29 the prevalence of manumission made Roman slavery (unlike that in the
Americas) an “open slavery”. Schiavone (2000) and Temin (no date) discuss the position
of slaves and the role of manumission at great length. Similarly, landowners are not
shown separately as a class since most landowners belonged to the four top classes and
their incomes from land are included in our totals.
(2) Top of the income distribution. The estimated Gini of between 37 and 40 might seem
low in the light of the excesses of wealth in Rome (see Table below with data gathered
from Tacitus’s Annals) But this extraordinary wealth was limited to a very few people at
the very top. It is very unlikely that they would be even selected (so few they were) to
participate in a modern random household survey. Moreover, their extraordinary wealth
was not out of step with what we observe today. For example, the fabulously rich
triumvir Marcus Crassus (-115 to -53) whose wealth was estimated at 200 million HS
(Schiavone, 2000, p.71) and hence his income at HS 12 million per year, 30 has more than
a counterpart in today’s Bill Gates and other super rich. Crassus’s income was equal to
about 32,000 mean Roman incomes. Using today’s US GDI per capita, the equivalent
would be an income of about $1 billion per year. But this is an income that is easily made
by many of today’s hyper-billionaires and yet the overall inequality is not much affected
by it. Bill Gates’s fortune is estimated at $50 billion which with 5% interest yields $2.5
29

According to Schiavone (2000, p.112), slaves represented 35 percent or more of Italy’s population. And
Italy was the most urbanized part of the Empire.

Using the conventional interest rate of 6 percent (see Finley, 1985, p.104).

billion per year, i.e., more than twice as much as Crassus—expressed in mean incomes of
one’s own time and place. According to The Forbes’ Magazine 2007 list of richest
people in the world, 31 four individuals in the United States have wealth above $20
billion which would place them around Crassus’s level.
Tacitus (Book XII, Chapter 53) gives the wealth of Pallas, a freedman, at 300 million HS.
This would have been 50 percent more than Crassus’s wealth. Augustius’ household’s
private income was estimated (as mentioned above) by Goldsmith at HS 15 million.
Using the conventional interest rate of 6 percent, it translates into a wealth of HS 250
million.

Note: Augustus’s donatives refer to the amounts given out at his death.
Inflation rate was estimated by Temin (2003, p. 149) to have been less than 1 percent p.a,, up to the end of
the Julio-Claudian era in 69. Thus, later (post-Augustan) incomes ought to be deflated accordingly.

Population and area. Population is taken from Goldsmith (1984: p. 263). Goldsmith
also gives the area as 3.3 million km2, while Taagepera (1979: Table 2, p. 125) gives 3.4
million km2 (for year 1, wrongly labeled as year 0).
Urbanization rate. Goldsmith’s (1984: pp. 272-3) range is 9 to 13 percent with the
former number “nearer the lower boundary at the beginning of the principate.” (The
urbanization rate seems to be calculated based on the cut-off point of 2-3,000 people). In
addition to Rome, the population of which is conventionally estimated at 1 million
(Bairoch 1985: p. 115), there were six cities (Carthage, Alexandria, Antioch, Ephesus,
Pergamum and Apamea) with populations in excess of 100,000 (Schiavone 2000: p. 61).
Taking their average size to be 150,000, it follows that about 2 million (or almost 4
percent of the population) lived in the cities that were larger than 100,000. For the
urbanization rate, we use a median estimate of 10 percent.
Mean income in $PPP. Obtained by expressing mean income from Goldsmith (HS 380)
in terms of the subsistence minimum (estimated at HS 180), and then pricing the latter at
$PPP 400. This yields mean income of $PPP 844 in 1990 prices. In his most recent
(2007) update (available at http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/) Maddison gives Italian National
Disposable Income in year 14 as $PPP 806.

Discussion.
Temin (2003) argues that Goldsmith’s calculation of the mean Roman income is too high.
However, there are at least three counterarguments to Temin: (1) his critique of
Goldsmith’s calculations is not based on Goldsmith’s methodology (which Temin
praises) but on Goldsmith’s apparent use of Rome-based wage rates for the rest of the
Empire including Egypt where both wheat prices and wages were much lower in nominal
terms. Temin then uses an average of the two nominal wage-rates, and obtains a
significantly lower overall Imperial mean income. But that issue can be sidestepped by
arguing that the Imperial numbers are expressed in Rome-city prices. This is acceptable
since Temin (2003, p. 19) himself believes that real (wheat) wages in Egypt and Romecity were about the same. Thus, Temin’s metrhodology of averaging two nominal wagerates seems faulty. (2) The level of infrastructural development, urbanization, size of a
large standing army (almost ½ of a percent of total population), and the point made by
Schiavone (2000) that regional differences in mean incomes might have been as high as 5
or even 6 to 1, 32 imply that an overall Imperial mean income was unlikely to have been
32

If there are large inter-regional differences, and even the poorest region is at the subsistence, then the
overall Imperial mean must be relatively high. Large regional differences are mentioned by Goldsmith too
(1984: p. 265).

68

less than HS 380 (as calculated by Goldsmith) which, using the assumptions regarding
the subsistence minimum, translates into about $PPP 850 (in 1990 prices). (3) There is
the consistency argument against changing Goldsmith’s mean income while retaining his
other calculations.

Appendix 3: Derivation of top 1 percent income share

Define H(y)=cumulative percentage of people with incomes higher than y (the
reverse of the normal distribution that cumulates people from the bottom income
upwards).
Also H(y) follows a Pareto distribution:
(1) H ( y ) = Ay − a
where a=Pareto exponent. If we do not have individual-level data but income distribution
tables with grouped data (fractiles of income distribution), then y should ideally be the
lower bound of the income interval. There are two differences between these
requirements and the data we have. First, we have only social classes arranged by their
mean incomes and population shares. In other words, we have percentages of people
with an average income and do not know lower or upper bounds of their income ranges.
Notice that the same problem exists when the data are arranged in deciles and only mean
income by decile is available. Second, there are very likely "leakages"--namely people
from lower (mean-poorer) social groups whose actual incomes are higher and should be
part of the top (and the reverse). This problem is specific to the type of data we have here.
These two departures of our data from the usual way income distribution statistics are
displayed (even in grouped form) should be kept in mind.
Now, let us define G(y) = total income of those with incomes above y divided by
total population; if it follows a Pareto distribution, then
(2) G ( y ) =

a
Ay −( a −1)
a −1

Also, by definition, yh = mean income of people with income greater than y, and

G( y) =

yhH ( y ) N
N

This means
(3) y h =

G( y) N G( y)
a
A ya
a
=
=
=
y
a −1
H ( y) N H ( y) a − 1 y
A a −1

For example, if the Pareto constant is 2, then mean income of those with income greater
than y, will be 2y.
Using (1) and (2), we can link G(y) and H(y):

72

(4) G ( y ) =

a
a
a
Ay −( a −1) =
Ay − a y =
H ( y) y
a −1
a −1
a −1

Write the expression (4) to the exponent a:
a

a
A
⎛ a ⎞
a a
Ha
= KoH a −1
(G ( y )) a = ⎜
⎟ H y =
a −1
H
⎝ a −1⎠
where Ko = constant, and we use expression (1).
Now this means that
a ln G = ln K 0 + (a − 1) ln H = K + (a − 1) ln H
where the constant K=ln Ko
Then,
ln H =

a
ln G + C
a −1

The ratio between the change in H and change in G is:
(5)

a
ln H 1 − ln H 2 (a / a − 1) ln G1 − (a / a − 1) ln G 2
=
=
a −1
ln G1 − ln G 2
ln G1 − ln G 2

Expression (5) is the key relationship that we fit in order to get the Pareto constant and to
interpolate for the values that we do not have in the original data. For example, in the
case of Rome we have H1=1.71 and H2=0.29. Now, the H1 people receive 24.4 percent
of total income. And H2 people receive 6.2 percent of total income. The top 1 percent
receive the share that is between the two.
Using (2) we find that the share of total income received by people whose income is
greater than y, s(y), is equal to:
(6) s ( y ) =

G( y) N G( y)
=
μN
μ

where μ=overall mean income.
We can then transform (5)
(7)

a
ln H 1 − ln H 2
ln H 1 − ln H 2
ln H 1 − ln H 2
=
=
=
a −1
ln G1 − ln G 2 ln s1 + ln μ − ln s 2 − ln μ
ln s1 − ln s 2

73

(7) will be the key relationship when we do the estimation:
Thus,
ln 1.71 − ln 0.29 0.536 − (−1.238) 1.774
=
=
= 1.295
ln 24.4 − ln 6.2
3.195 − 1.825
1.37
From which we find α=4.38.
Now, to find the income share of the top 1 percent, we use (7) again.
ln 1.71 − ln 1
= 1.295
ln 24.4 − ln x
0.536
= 1.295
3.195 − ln x
And thus x=16.13.
We obtain the same result if we do:
ln 1 − ln 0.29
= 1.295.
ln x − ln 6.2
Note that the data we have here are: (i) the bottom cut-off point (y), the share of
people above that income level, H(y), and (iii) the share of total income they receive,
s(y). The cut-off point is crucial. If we have only the means (for each fractile) and the
percentage of people, we are effectively treating the fractile means as the bottom cut off
points.
We can also get the important relationship between the income share and the
number of people above the income level y. Using (4) and (6), we get
s( y)μ =

a
H ( y) y
a −1

and
s( y) =

a
y
H ( y)
a −1
μ

If H(y)=1 percent, then s(y)=(a/a-1)(y/μ), where y is the cut-off point above which
the top 1 percent of the population begins, and μ=overall mean. The ratio y/μ expresses,
in terms of the overall mean, income level where the top 1 percent of population begins
74

(the 1 percent cut-off point). Going back to the Roman example where we found α=4.38
and s(y)=16.13, we can readily see that this implies a cut-off point of 12.4.

* Calculated using Gini2 measures unless it is unavailable, in which case Gini1 is used. Modern Ginis,
calculated from individual-level data from national household surveys, are from World Income Distribution
database, benchmark year 2002 (see http://econ.worldbank.org/projects/inequality).

Note: Income distributions for Holland not available. All modern countries as calculated from LIS database
(using disposable per capita income). The cut-off point indicates the income level (expressed in terms of
overall country mean) where the top percentile begins. For the modern societies, it is estimated by taking
the mean income of the 99th percentile and adding 3 standard deviations (of income within that percentile).
Where available, the Gini is Gini2, otherwise Gini1 (Table 2).
