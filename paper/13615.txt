Relative Goods' Prices, Pure Inflation, and the Phillips Correlation
Ricardo Reis and Mark W. Watson
NBER Working Paper No. 13615
November 2007, Revised August 2009
JEL No. C32,C43,E31
ABSTRACT
This paper uses a dynamic factor model for the quarterly changes in consumption goods’ prices to
separate them into three independent components: idiosyncratic relative-price changes, a low-dimensional
index of aggregate relative-price changes, and an index of equiproportional changes in all inflation
rates, that we label “pure” inflation. The paper estimates the model on U.S. data since 1959, and it
presents a simple structural model that relates the three components of price changes to fundamental
economic shocks. We use the estimates of the pure inflation and aggregate relative-price components
to answer two questions. First, what share of the variability of inflation is associated with each component,
and how are they related to conventional measures of monetary policy and relative-price shocks? We
find that pure inflation accounts for 15-20% of the variability in inflation while our aggregate relative-price
index accounts most of the rest. Conventional measures of relative prices are strongly but far from
perfectly correlated with our relative-price index; pure inflation is only weakly correlated with money
growth rates, but more strongly correlated with nominal interest rates. Second, what drives the Phillips
correlation between inflation and measures of real activity? We find that the Phillips correlation essentially
disappears once we control for goods’ relative-price changes. This supports modern theories of inflation
dynamics based on price rigidities and many consumption goods.

One of the goals of macroeconomics is to explain the aggregate sources of changes in
goods’ prices. If there was a single consumption good in the world, as is often assumed in
models, describing the price changes of consumption would be a trivial matter. But, in
reality, there are many goods and prices, and there is an important distinction between price
changes that are equiproportional across all goods (absolute-price changes) and changes in
the cost of some goods relative to others (relative-price changes). The goal of this paper is to
empirically separate these sources of price changes and to investigate their relative size, their
determinants, and their role in the macroeconomic Phillips relation between inflation and
output.
Our data are the quarterly price changes in each of 187 sectors in the U.S. personal
consumption expenditures (PCE) category of the national income and product accounts from
1959:1 to 2006:2. Denoting the rate of price change for the i’th good between dates t–1 and t
by it, and letting t be the Nx1 vector that collects these goods’ price changes, we model
their co-movement using a linear factor model:

(1)

t = ΛFt + ut

The k factors in the kx1 vector Ft capture common sources of variation in prices.
These might be due to aggregate shocks affecting all sectors, like changes in aggregate
productivity, government spending, or monetary policy, or they might be due to shocks that
affect many but not all sectors, like changes in energy prices, weather events in agriculture,
or exchange rate fluctuations and the price of tradables.

The N×k matrix Λ contains

coefficients (“factor loadings”) that determine how each individual good’s price responds to
these shocks. The Nx1 vector ut is a remainder that captures good-specific relative-price
variability associated with idiosyncratic sectoral events or measurement error.

1

We see the empirical model in (1) as a useful way to capture the main features of the
covariance matrix of changes in good’s prices. To the extent that the factors in Ft explain a
significant share of the variation in the data, then changes in goods' prices provide
information on the aggregate shocks that macroeconomists care about. We separate this
aggregate component of price changes into an absolute-price component and possibly several
relative-price components. Denoting these by the scalar at and the Rt vector of size k−1
respectively, this decomposition can be written as:

(2)

ΛFt = lat + ΓRt

Absolute price changes affect all prices equiproportionately, so l is an N×1 vector of
ones, while relative price changes affect prices in different proportions according to the
N×(k−1) matrix Γ. The first question this paper asks is whether the common sources of
variation, ΛFt, can be decomposed in this way.
One issue is that l may not be in the column space of Λ; that is, there may no
absolute-price changes in the data. Given estimates of the factor model, we can investigate
this empirically using statistical tests and measures of fit.

Another issue is that the

decomposition in (2) is not unique; that is, at and Rt are not separately identified. The key
source of the identification problem is easy to see: for any arbitrary (k−1)×1 vector , we
have that lat + ΓRt = l(at + ´Rt) + ( − l´)Rt, so that (at, Rt) cannot be distinguished from
(at + α′Rt, Rt). The intuition is that the absolute change in prices cannot be distinguished
from a change in “average relative prices” α´Rt, but there are many ways to define what this
average means.1

1
One natural way is to assume that relative price changes must add up to zero across all goods. Reis and
Watson (2007) use this restriction to define a numeraire price index that measures absolute price changes. A
further identification issue in the model is that Rt = AA−1Rt for arbitrary non-singular matrix A. For our
purposes we will not need to separately identify the elements of Rt so this final issue is not important.

2

We overcome this identification problem by focusing instead on two independent
components: “pure” inflation υt, and a low-dimensional relative price index ρt defined as:

(3)

υt = at − E[at | {R τ }T 1 ]

(4)

ρt = E[Ft | {R τ }T 1 ]

Pure inflation is identified, and it has a simple interpretation: it is the common
component in price changes that has an equiproportional effect on all prices and is
uncorrelated with changes in relative prices at all dates. We label it “pure” because, by
construction, its changes are uncorrelated with relative-price changes at any point in time,
and because it corresponds to the famous thought experiment that economists have used
since David Hume (1752): “imagine that all prices increase in the same proportion, but no
relative price changes.”2 The relative-price index captures all of the aggregate movements in
goods’ price changes that are associated with some change in relative prices at some date. In
an economic model, these components map into different fundamental shocks. For instance,
an exogenous but anticipated increase in the money supply that leads all price-setters to raise
their prices in the same proportion leads to pure inflation, while an unanticipated increase in
money to which some firms respond, but others do not, leads to a change in the relative-price
index.3 In this dichotomy, inflation due to changes in the money supply that are reactions to
relative price changes also lead to changes in the relative-price index, since pure inflation is
uncorrelated with any relative-price change.
The first contribution of this paper consists in estimating the empirical model in (1)(4) providing a decomposition of inflation into three independent components:
2

The definition of pure inflation also appears in current textbooks (Olivier J. Blanchard, 2003: 33).
In some sticky-price models, like a Calvo model in which the frequency of price adjustments differs across
sectors, an anticipated increase in the money supply would not lead to pure inflation, as the price-setters are, by
assumption, unable to all raise their prices at once.

(5)

t = lνt + ρt + ut

Our estimates show that these three components have differed markedly over the last
40 years, and allow us to address two issues. First, we are able to quantify the share of
inflation’s variability associated with each of the components. We find that for a typical
good, its idiosyncratic relative-price component accounts for roughly 70 percent of its
variability, so that macroeconomic shocks account for almost as much as 1/3 of the
movement in sectoral prices. Within aggregate sources of variation, pure inflation accounts
for about 15-20 percent of the variability in PCE inflation. Researchers must be cautious
when comparing the predictions for inflation from models with a single consumption good to
the data, because most of the variation in standard aggregate inflation indices is associated
with relative-price movements, which these models ignore. Second, we relate our estimates
to other variables. At business-cycle frequencies, pure inflation is barely correlated with
money growth, while it has a correlation of around 0.5 with nominal interest rates. The
relative-price index is weakly related to food and energy prices, but it is strongly related to
the relative price of non-durable and services. However, even considering as many as four
conventional measures of relative-price changes, the two relative-price factors in our baseline
specification appear to be a more comprehensive measure of relative price movements.
The second contribution of this paper is to re-examine the correlation between
inflation and real activity. Alban W. H. Phillips (1958) famously first estimated it, and a vast
subsequent literature confirmed that it is reasonably large and stable (James H. Stock and
Watson, 1999). This correlation has posed a challenge for macroeconomists because it
signals that the classical dichotomy between real and nominal variables may not hold. The
typical explanation for the Phillips correlation in economic models involves movements in
4

relative prices. For instance, models with sticky wages but flexible goods prices (or viceversa), explain it by movements in the relative price of labor. Models of the transaction
benefits of money or of limited participation in asset markets explain the Phillips correlation
by changes in the relative price of consumption today vis-à-vis tomorrow, or asset returns.
Models with international trade and restrictions on the currency denomination of prices
explain it using the relative price of domestic vis-à-vis foreign goods, or exchange rates. We
show that, after controlling for all of these relative prices, the Phillips correlation is still
quantitatively and statistically significant. Then, using our estimates, we control instead for
the relative price of different goods.

This would be suggested by models with many

consumption goods, as is the case in modern sticky-price or sticky-information models. We
find that, controlling for relative goods prices, the Phillips correlation becomes quantitatively
negligible This suggests a more important role for rigidities in goods markets and a less
important role for rigidities in labor or asset markets.
The paper is organized as follows. Section I outlines the methods that we use to
estimate the factor model and to compute the inflation components and their correlation with
other variables. Section II presents a stylized structural model of inflation dynamics that
generates the decomposition in equation (5) and relates its three components to fundamental
economic shocks. Sections III and IV present estimates of the factor model, the factors, and
their relation to observables. Section V investigates the Phillips correlation, and section VI
discusses the robustness of the conclusions in the previous two sections to different
specifications.

Section VII concludes, summarizing our findings and discussing their

implications.

Relation to the literature
There has been much research using statistical models to define and measure inflation

5

(see the survey by E. Anthony Selvanathan and D. S. Prasada Rao, 1994) but, as far as we are
aware, there have been relatively few attempts at separating absolute from relative-price
changes. An important exception is Michael F. Bryan and Stephen G. Cechetti (1993), who
use a dynamic factor model in a panel of 36 price series to measure what we defined above as
at.

They achieve identification and estimate their model imposing strong and strict

assumptions on the co-movement of relative prices, in particular that relative prices are
independent across goods.

Moreover, while they use their estimates to forecast future

inflation, we use them to separate inflation into components and to assess the Phillips
correlation.4
In methods, our use of large-scale dynamic factor models draws on the literature on
their estimation by maximum likelihood (e.g., Danny Quah and Thomas J. Sargent, 1993,
and Catherine Doz, Domenico Giannone and Lucrezia Reichlin, 2008) and principal
components (e.g., Jushan Bai and Serena Ng, 2002, Mario Forni, Marc Hallin, Marco Lippi
and Reichlin, 2000, and Stock and Watson, 2002). We provide a new set of questions to
apply these methods.
Using these methods on price data, Riccardo Cristadoro, Forni, Reichlin and
Giovanni Veronesi (2005) estimate a common factor on a panel with price and quantity series
and ask a different question: whether it forecasts inflation well. Marlene Amstad and Simon
M. Potter (2007) address yet another issue, using dynamic factor models to build measures of
the common component in price changes that can be updated daily. Marco Del Negro (2006)
estimates a factor model using sectoral PCE data allowing for a single common component
and relative price factors associated with durable, non-durable, and services goods sectors.
Finally, Filippo Altissimo, Benoit Mojon, and Paolo Zaffaroni (2009) estimate a common
factor model using disaggregated Euro-area CPI indices and use the model to investigate the

importance of asset prices for an inflation index.

persistence in aggregate Euro-area inflation. The common factor in these papers is not a
measure of pure inflation, since it affects different prices differently.
Closer to our paper, in the use of dynamic factor models to extract a measure of
inflation that is then used to assess macroeconomic relations suggested by theory, is Jean
Boivin, Marc Giannoni and Ilian Mihov (2009). They extract a macroeconomic shock using
many series that include prices and real quantities, estimate the impulse response of
individual prices to this shock, and then compare their shape to the predictions of different
models of nominal rigidities. In contrast, we use only price data (and no quantity data) to
separate different components of inflation, so that we can later ask how they relate to
quantities. Moreover, we apply our estimates to assess unconditional correlations of real
variables with inflation, whereas they focus on the link conditional on identified monetary
shocks. Finally, we separate relative prices and pure inflation, while their inflation measure
is a mix of the two, so we ask a different set of questions.

I. Measuring the Components of Inflation and Calculating MacroCorrelations

The model in (1)-(4) is meant to capture the key properties of the inflation series as
they pertain to the estimation of their separate components, with an eye on the applications
that we discussed in the introduction. We use a factor model for the covariance between
sectoral inflation rates because past research focusing on the output of different sectors, and
macroeconomic variables more generally, found that this model is able to flexibly and
parsimoniously account for the main features of the economic data (Stock and Watson, 1989,
2005, Forni et al, 2000).

7

A. Estimating the Dynamic Factor Model
The strategy for estimating the model can be split in two steps. First, we choose the
number of factors (k). Second, we estimate the factors (at, Rt) and the factor loadings (),
and examine the restriction that the factor loading on at is equal to unity. We discuss each of
these in turn.
Choosing the number of factors, that is the size k of the vector Ft, involves a tradeoff. On the one hand, a higher k implies that a larger share of the variance in the data is
captured by the aggregate components. On the other hand, the extra factors are increasingly
harder to reliably estimate and are less quantitatively significant. Bai and Ng (2002) have
developed estimators for k that are consistent (as min(N,T) → ∞) in models such as this. We
compute the Bai-Ng estimators, which are based on the number of dominant eigenvalues of
the covariance (or correlation) matrix of the data. We complement them by also looking at a
few informative descriptive statistics on the additional explanatory power of the marginal
factor. In particular, we estimate an unrestricted version of (1) that does not impose the
restriction in (2) that the first factor has a unit loading. We start with one factor and
successively increase the number of factors, calculating at each step the incremental share of
the variance of each good’s inflation explained by the extra factor.

If the increase in

explained variance is large enough across many goods, we infer it is important to include at
least these many factors. These pieces of information lead us to choose a benchmark value
for k. In section VI, we investigate the robustness of the results to different choices of k.
To estimate the factor model, we follow two approaches.

The first approach

estimates (1)-(2) by restricted principal components. It consists of solving the least-squares
problem:

(6)

N

T

i 1

t 1

min Γ ,( a , R )  wi  ( it  at  γ 'i R t ) 2

8

where i denotes the i’th row of  (from (2)) and wi are weights. We set wi equal to the
inverse of the sample variance of it so that the solution to (6) yields the restricted principal
components associated with the sample correlation matrix of the inflation series (C.
Radhakrishna Rao (1973), section 8g.2). When N and T are large and the error terms uit are
weakly cross-sectionally and serially correlated, the principal components/least squares
estimators of the factors have two important statistical properties that are important for our
analysis (Stock and Watson, 2002, Bai, 2003, Bai and Ng, 2006). First, the estimators are
consistent. Second, the sampling error in the estimated factors is sufficiently small that it can
be ignored when the estimates, say aˆt and Rˆ t , are used in regressions in place of the true
values of at and Rt.
The second approach makes parametric assumptions on the stochastic properties of
the three latent components (at, Rt, and uit), estimates the parameters of the model by
maximum likelihood, and then computes estimates of the factors using signal extraction
formulae. In particular, we assume that (at, Rt) follow a vector autoregression, while uit
follow independent autoregressive processes, all with Gaussian errors.5

The resulting

unobserved-components model is:

(7)

it = at + γi′Rt + uit

(8)

a 
Φ ( L )  t  = t
 Rt 

(9)

βi(L)uit = ci + eit

5

One concern with assuming Gaussianity is that disaggregated inflation rates are skewed and fat-tailed. In
general, skewness is not a major concern for Gaussian MLEs in models like this (Watson, 1989), but excess
kurtosis is more problematic. To mitigate the problem, we follow Bryan, Cecchetti and Rodney L. Wiggins II
(1997) and pre-treat the data to eliminate large outliers (section III has specifics).

9

with {eit},{ejt}j≠i,{t} being mutually and serially uncorrelated sequences that are normally
distributed with mean zero and variances var(eit) =  i2 , var(t) = Q. To identify the factors,
we use the normalizations that the columns of Г are mutually orthogonal and add up to zero,
although the estimates of υt and ρt do not depend on this normalization.
Numerically maximizing the likelihood function is computationally complex because
of the size of the model. For example, our benchmark model includes at and two additional
relative price factors, a VAR(4) for (8), univariate AR(1) models for the {uit}, and N = 187
price series. There are 971 parameters to be estimated.6 Despite its complexity, the linear
latent variable structure of the model makes it amenable to estimation using an EM algorithm
with the “E-step” computed by Kalman smoothing and the “M-step” by linear regression.
The appendix to this paper describes this in more detail.
While this exact dynamic factor model (7)-(9) is surely misspecified − for instance, it
ignores small amounts of cross-sectional correlation among the uit terms, conditional
heteroskedasticity in the disturbances, and so forth − it does capture the key cross sectional
and serial correlation patterns in the data. Doz, Giannone and Reichlin (2008) study the
properties of factors estimated from an exact factor structure as in (7)-(9) with parameters
estimated by Gaussian MLE, but under the assumption that the data are generated from an
approximate factor model (so that (7)-(9) are misspecified). Their analysis shows that when
N and T are large, the factor estimates from (7)-(9) are consistent despite potential
misspecification in the model.
We carry out our analysis using the principal components estimates of the factors and
the estimates from (7)-(9). To save space, unless noted otherwise, the results reported in
sections III-V are based on the estimates from the parametric factor model (7)-(9); results
with the principal components estimates of the factors are shown in section VI, which
6

The number of unknown parameters is 186 + 185 (γi) + 187 (βi) + 187 (ci) + 187 (var(ei)) + 36 () + 3 (var(ε))
= 971, where these values reflect the normalizations used for identification.

10

focuses on the robustness of the empirical conclusions.
The model in (1)-(2) imposes the restriction that the loading on the absolute-price
factor must be one for all goods. To investigate how restrictive this is, we calculate the
increase in fit that comes from dropping the restriction, measured as the fraction of (sample)
variance of i explained by the factors. Moreover, we estimate the value of ςi in the N
regressions:

it = ςiat + i′Rt + uit,

(10)

using aˆt and Rˆ t in place of at and Rt, as explained above. When ςi = 1, this corresponds to
our restricted model, so we can use the estimates of ςi to judge how adequate is this
restriction.

B. Computing the Aggregate Components of Inflation
To separate the components of inflation and obtain time-series for pure inflation and
the relative-price index (υt, ρt), we need to calculate the expectation of absolute-price changes
conditional on relative-price changes in (3)-(4). This requires a model of the joint dynamics
of at and Rt. We model this as a VAR, as in (8), which is estimated by Gaussian MLE in the
parametric factor model, or by OLS using the principal-component estimators for the factors
as in the two-step approach taken in factor-augmented VARs (Bernanke, Boivin, Eliasz,
2005). Finally, given estimates of (L), we compute the implied projection in (3) and (4) to
obtain pure inflation and the relative-price index. Details are provided in the appendix.

C. Computing Macro-Correlations at Different Frequencies
As described in the introduction, we are interested in the relationship between pure
11

inflation and the relative-price index, υt and ρt, and other macro variables such as the PCE
deflator, food and energy prices, the unemployment rate, or the nominal interest rate. Let xt
denote one of these macro variables of interest and consider the projection of xt onto leads
and lags of υt (or ρt)

xt = δ(L)υt + et.

(11)

The fraction of variability of xt associated with {υt} (or {ρt}) can be computed as the
R2 from this regression. Adding additional control variables, say zt, to the regression makes
it possible to compute the partial R2 of x with respect to leads and lags of υt (or ρt) after
controlling for zt.
We will compute frequency-domain versions of these variance decompositions and
partial R2’s (squared coherences or partial squared coherences). One of their virtues is that
they allow us to focus on specific frequency bands, like business cycle frequencies. Another
virtue is that they are robust to the filter used to define the variables (e.g., levels or first
differences). In particular we report the squared coherence (the R2 at a given frequency)
between x and υ (or ρ) averaged over various frequency bands. When it is relevant, we also
report partial squared coherences controlling for (leads and lags) of a vector of variables z
(the partial R2 controlling for z at a given frequency), again averaged over various frequency
bands.
We are also interested in the relationship between Rt and standard measures of
relative prices such the relative price of consumer durables, food, energy, and so forth. Let qt
denote a vector of these variables. We summarize the correlation between R and q using
canonical correlations, again implemented using frequency domain methods. In particular
we report the squared canonical coherences between R and q averaged over various

12

frequency bands.
These various spectral R2 measures are computed using VAR spectral estimators,
where the VAR is estimated, in the first instance, using xt, aˆt , Rˆ t , and (if appropriate) zt,
and in the second instance using Rˆ t and qt. The standard errors for the spectral measures are
computed using the delta-method and a heteroskedastic-robust estimator for the covariance
matrix of the VAR parameters. Details are provided in the appendix.

II. A Theoretical Framework

The statistical decomposition in (5) expresses it in terms of three components: vt,
which we have labeled pure inflation, t, which is a function of aggregate relative-price
shocks, and uit, which captures sector-specific relative-price changes or measurement error.
Structural macro models give rise to an analogous representation for inflation, where the
components depend on the various shocks in the macro model. The specifics of the structural
model determine the relative variances of the components and their correlation with nonprice variables such as real output, money, interest rates, and so forth.
This section presents a simple economic model of inflation that relates key structural
shocks to the statistical constructs v,  and u. The goal is to help guide the reader’s intuition
about the forces underlying the statistical factors that we estimate, so the model is kept as
simple as possible. We believe that its main conclusions are robust to the specific modeling
choices (like the source of nominal rigidities, or the particular functional forms), and that
this model could serve as the starting point for a more structural empirical analysis of
inflation's components in future work.

A. The Model
13

The general-equilibrium setup follows Blanchard and Nobuhiro Kiyotaki (1987) and
Michael Woodford (2003) allowing for many sectors.

A representative consumer

where δ < 1 is the discount factor and ψ is the elasticity of labor supply. Total labor supplied
is Lt and Ct is a consumption aggregator with elasticity  across N sectors, indexed by i, and
across a continuum of varieties within each sector, indexed by j:

At every date, the consumer purchases each good at price Pit(j) for a total spending of
S t   i  Pit ( j )Cit ( j ) dj , earns a wage Wt for labor services, and pays taxes at rate Tt. She has

three other sources income that are lump-sum: profits Dt from firms, transfers Gt from the
fiscal authorities, and money injections Ht from the monetary authority.

Finally, the

consumer holds money Mt to save and to purchase consumption goods. The budget and
cash-in-advance constraints are:

(14)

(15)

St  M t  (1  Tt )Wt Lt  M t 1  Dt  Gt  H t ,
St  M t 1  H t .

14

Firms are monopolistically competitive, each hiring labor Lit(j) to produce output
Yit(j) with productivity Xit(j) subject to decreasing returns to scale at rate η < 1:

Yit ( j )  X it ( j ) Lit ( j )

(16)

Finally, the two government authorities simply return their funds to consumers, so
that Ht = Mt – Mt-1 and Gt = TtWtLt. Market clearing in the goods and labor market require
Yit(j) = Cit(j) and Lt   i  Lit ( j ) dj respectively.
In this simple economy, there is uncertainty about taxes Tt, the money supply Mt, and
productivity Xit(j), each of which depends on shocks. Letting small letters denote the natural
logarithm of the corresponding capital letters:

The six independent shocks (in Greek letters with time subscripts) are: firm-specific
productivity (), sectoral productivity (χ), aggregate productivity with a sector-specific
impact (ζ), anticipated monetary policy (ω), unanticipated monetary policy (μ) and
anticipated tax changes (τ). In (18) note that

the monetary policy rule responds

systematically to productivity shocks. For simplicity, we assume that each shock follows an
independent random walk, and that the variety-specific and sector-specific shocks
approximately average to zero in each time period,

. We further assume that mt grows over time at a rate m that is large enough so that
15

δEt(Mt/Mt+1) < 1, ensuring that the cash-in-advance constraint always binds.
We model price rigidity through imperfect information as in Robert E. Lucas Jr.
(1973) and N. Gregory Mankiw and Reis (2002). In particular, we assume that at the
beginning of every period, all firms learn about the past values of the six shocks, as well as
the current values of the anticipated fiscal and monetary shocks. However, only a randomly
drawn fraction i of firms in each sector observe the contemporaneous realization of the other
four shocks before making their pricing decisions. The remaining 1–i fraction of firms learn
these shocks only in the following period, and we denote their expectations with this
incomplete information by Eˆ (.) .

This assumption of imperfect information has a long

tradition in macroeconomics (Woodford, 2003, chapter 3, labels it the “neoclassical” case)
and is in line with the recent work on sticky-information Phillips curves.
The appendix solves for the equilibrium in this economy, showing that it can be
reduced to the following equations for pit, pt, and yt (ignoring constants):

productivity . The first equation is the fundamental pricing equation in new Keynesian
models, relating sectoral prices to marginal costs, which in this model depend on aggregate
output, sectoral productivity, and taxes. The second equation is a log-linear approximation to

quantity theory relation that follows from the cash-in-advance constraint.

This basic

reduced-form structure is shared by many modern models of inflation dynamics.
A few steps of algebra show that sectoral price changes in this economy follow the
same linear dynamic factor model in (5), t = lνt + Θρt + ut, that we will estimate in the
data. The three components are:

B. Relation Between the Theory and the Estimates
We ask, in the model, the same two questions that we will ask in the data: what
part of price changes is due to pure inflation, relative-price aggregate shocks, and

17

idiosyncratic shocks? And, which shocks account for the Phillips correlation between real
activity and inflation? Answering these questions shock by shock (table 1 summarizes the
results):
Anticipated money (ω): When money grows by 1 percent and all price-setters know

about it, then all raise their prices by exactly 1 percent once and for all. No relative prices
change and there is pure inflation.

The quantity theory in turn implies that output is

unchanged so there is no Phillips correlation. This is a result of the absence of money
illusion in this model, as rational consumers and firms realize that nothing but units have
changed, so there is no reason to change any real actions.
Unanticipated money (μ): In this case, only a fraction i of the firms in each sector

change their prices in response to a shock while the others remain inattentive. As a result,
sectoral inflation is different across sectors, depending on the share of attentive firms in each
sector, so there is an aggregate relative-price change. A monetary expansion raises output,
because of the information stickiness of prices, and thus there is a Phillips correlation.
Aggregate productivity (ζ): This shock has a similar effect as an unanticipated money

shock, both through its direct effect and through the systematic response of monetary policy.
Either because it affects the productivity of different sectors differently, or because of
different information stickiness across sectors, the shock induces a change in relative prices.
Output increases when firms become more productive so there is a Phillips correlation.
Sectoral productivity (χ): These shocks map directly into the idiosyncratic shocks to

relative prices in our measurement model. Because we assumed that an approximate law of
large numbers holds, they do not affect output, so they do not generate a Phillips correlation.
Firm-specific productivity (): These shocks are an example of something that the

statistical model will miss. While these shocks induce relative-price changes within each
sector, they wash out at the sectoral level so they do not affect relative sectoral prices.
18

Likewise, while they affect the allocation of production across firms, within each sector, they
aggregate to zero on aggregate, so they neither move aggregate output nor prices. Whether
these shocks are important or not cannot be answered without more disaggregated data.
Anticipated tax changes (τ): When taxes increase, the representative agent raises her

wage demand. As this affects all firms equally, all raise their price in the same amount.
Therefore, there is pure inflation. However, output falls as the return to work has fallen. The
Phillips correlation results not from a change in the relative price of goods, but rather from a
change in the relative price of labor versus consumption.
To conclude, our empirical estimates are informative about the role of different
shocks in this economy. Our first empirical contribution, the estimates of the variability of
overall inflation due to pure inflation, aggregate sources of relative prices, and idiosyncratic
shocks, pins down the relative variance of anticipated versus unanticipated shocks and of
aggregate versus sectoral shocks.7 Our second empirical contribution, whether the Phillips
correlation is still present after we control for goods’ relative prices, tells us whether this
famous relation is due to monetary and productivity shocks via goods’ relative prices as
models of monopolistic competition emphasize, or whether it is due instead to shocks to
other relative prices like real wages.

III. The Estimated Factor Model

A. The Data
The price data are monthly chained price indices for personal consumption
expenditures by major type of product and expenditure from 1959:1 to 2006:6. Inflation is
7
Our definition of pure inflation only allows us to gauge the relative variance of the unsystematic parts of
money supply. To identify the policy rule, in this case the coefficient  , requires more structure just as in the
VAR literature on identifying monetary policy shocks. Also, as in that literature, a small role for pure inflation
should not be confused for a small role for monetary policy.

19

measured in percentage points at an annual rate using the final month of the quarter prices: it
= 400×ln(Pit/Pit−1), where Pit are prices for March, June, September, and December.8 Prices
are for goods at the highest available level of disaggregation that have data for the majority
of dates, which gives 214 series. We then excluded series with unavailable observations (9
series), more than 20 quarters of 0 price changes (4 series), and series j if there was another
series i such that Cor(it, jt) > 0.99 and Cor(it, jt) > .99 (14 series). This left N = 187
price series.

Large outliers were evident in some of the inflation series, and these

observations were replaced with centered 7-quarter local medians. A detailed description of
the data and transformations are given in the appendix.
As the economic model from section II makes clear, the level of aggregation across
goods and time affects the interpretation of the estimated model. For example, as stressed in
section II, the sectoral data provide no information about the relative prices of goods within a
sector.

The hope, therefore, is that the sectoral information is rich enough to capture

important aggregate shocks. Furthermore, as with all models of information flows and
discrete actions, the definition of the appropriate time period is important. The use of
quarterly data means, for example, that equiproportional changes in all sectoral price indexes
within the quarter are included in at, even if these changes occur at different times throughout
the quarter. Said differently, the relative price factors, Rt, capture only those relative prices
changes that persist for at least one quarter. Because most macroeconomic analyses focusing
on aggregate shocks use quarterly data, we are not departing from tradition.
One feature of these data is the constant introduction of new goods within each sector
(Christian Broda and David Weinstein, 2007). Insofar as our statistical factor model of
sectoral price changes remains a good description of their co-movement during the sample
period, this should not affect our results. Another common concern with price data is the
8

We considered using monthly, rather than quarterly, price changes, but found that the extra idiosyncratic error
in monthly price changes outweighed the benefit of more observations.

20

need to re-weight prices to track expenditure shares and measure their effects on welfare.
Our model in (1)-(5) does not require any expenditure shares, since the objective of
measuring pure inflation is not to measure the cost of living, but rather to separate absolute
from relative price changes.

B. The Number of Factors and the Estimated Parameters
Panel (a) of figure 1 shows the largest twenty eigenvalues of the sample correlation
matrix of the inflation data. It is clear that there is one large eigenvalue, but it is much less
clear how many additional factors are necessary.

The Bai-Ng estimates confirm this

uncertainty: their ICP1, ICP2 and ICP3 estimates are 2 factors, 1 factor, and 11 factors
respectively. Panel (b) of figure 1 summarizes instead the fraction of variance explained by
unrestricted factor models with 1 through 4 factors for each of the 187 inflation series.9 To
make the figure easier to read, the series have been ordered by the fraction of variance
explained by the 1-factor model. The uncertainty in the appropriate number of factors is
evident here as well: the second factor improves the fit for several series, but it is unclear
whether a third, fourth or fifth factor is necessary. In our benchmark model we will use 3
factors (at and two relative price factors in Rt). We summarize the key results for other
choices in section VI.10
We use the parametric factor estimates from (5)-(7) in our benchmark calculations;
results using the principal components estimators are similar and are summarized in Section
VI. The VAR for the factors in the benchmark specification uses 4 lags, guided by a few

9

These measures were computed as Ri2  1  [var(ui ) / s2i ] , where var(ui ) is the estimated variance of ui implied

by the estimated model and s2i is the sample variance of i.
10

There is also uncertainty about the number of dynamic factors, which corresponds to the rank of the
covariance matrix of  in (8). The estimator developed in Bai and Ng (2007) indicates that the number of
dynamic factors is the same as the number of static factors, while the estimators discussed in Dante Amengual
and Watson (2007) and Hallin and Roman Liska (2007) suggest one dynamic factor. In our parametric model
we will not constrain the rank of the covariance matrix of .

21

diagnostic tests (not reported). It is well-known that inflation series are quite persistent and it
is difficult to reject the null hypothesis that they have a unit root in the autoregressive
representation (Pivetta and Reis, 2007). When we estimate the VAR in (6), we find that
there are several large roots in (L) and one that is very close to unity. In our benchmark
model, we impose two unit roots in (L); that is, at and one of the relative price factors are
treated as I(1) processes. Results in which these unit roots are not imposed turn out to be
very similar, and again, we summarize results for these models in section VI. Finally, we use
only one lag in the univariate autoregressions of uit, as suggested by diagnostic tests. The
estimated AR(1) coefficients for uit are typically small, suggesting I(0) variation in the
idiosyncratic relative inflation rates.
Values for the estimated parameters for the benchmark model are given in the
appendix.

C. The Unit Coefficient on at
Panel (a) of figure 2 summarizes the fit of unrestricted factor models that do not
impose the unit restriction on the loading of the absolute-price factor. It shows that the
increase in fit, measured by R2 is less than 3 percent for 80 percent of the series. The median
increase is less than 1 percent. The unrestricted model appears to fit appreciably better only
for a small number of price series: for 10 series the increase in R2 exceeds 10 percent. Panel
(b) of figure 2 shows the ordered values of the estimates of ςi from (10), that is the leastsquares coefficient from regressing it on aˆt controlling for Rˆ t . Most of the estimates are
close to 1. Panel (c) shows the ordered values of the (4-lag Newey-West) t-statistic testing
that ςi =1. There are far more rejections of the restriction than would be expected by
sampling error, with over 30 percent of the t-statistics above the standard 5 percent critical
values and over 20 percent above the 1 percent critical values. These results suggest that, as
22

a formal matter, the unit factor loading restriction in (2) appears to be rejected by the data.
That said, the results in panels (a) and (b) suggest that little is lost by imposing this
restriction.

IV. Decomposing Sectoral Inflation

Figure 3 shows the historical decomposition of headline PCE inflation (top panel) and
a representative sector, “major household appliances” (bottom panel). By construction, the
pure-inflation (v) component is identical in the two plots (note the difference in the scales),
while the idiosyncratic (u) component differ across goods, and the aggregate relative prices
components () differs in its impact (). Because υt = at − E[at | {R τ }T 1 ], we have plotted
the data from 1965-1999 to eliminate uncertainty associated with pre-sample and postsample values of Rt.
Pure inflation is somewhat smoother than the other series and less volatile. The
standard deviation of υt is 0.3 percent, while the standard deviation of PCE inflation
changes is 1.7 percent. Sectoral inflation is more volatile: the standard deviation for changes
in “Major Household Appliances” is 4.1 percent, and the median across all 187 sectors is 5.9
percent. Evidently, aggregate relative price changes () explain much of the low-frequency
variability in headline PCE. For example, much of the increases in inflation in the early
1970s and the declines in inflation in the 1990s were associated with changes in the relative
price factor. That said, pure inflation (v) did account for over 2 percent of the increase in
inflation from 1970-1980 and over 2 percent of the subsequent decline from 1980-1983.

A. The Relative Size of the Components
Table 2 shows the fraction of the variability of overall inflation associated with each
23

of its components, either averaged over all frequencies or just over business-cycle
frequencies. The first row of the table uses the PCE deflator as the measure of overall
inflation and shows that, at business-cycle frequencies, 15 percent of the movements in the
series are accounted for by pure inflation, 76 percent is accounted for by the relative-price
index, and the remainder is accounted for by the idiosyncratic sectoral shocks. The second
and third row look at two other commonly used measures of overall inflation, the GDP
deflator and the Consumer Price Index, and show similar results.

The 2-dimensional

relative-price index captures most of the variance in aggregate measures of inflation, while
pure inflation plays a smaller but not negligible role. Including all frequencies, the role of
pure inflation rises (with the exception of the CPI) while the relative-price index is
significantly less prevalent.
These results have implications for macroeconomic models. For example, in terms of
the model of section II, this 5-to-1 ratio in the relative variances of the relative-price index
and pure inflation would say that a weighted average of the variance of anticipated shocks is
significantly less volatile than an average of the unanticipated shocks. More generally, it is
customary to compare the predictions of models with a single good for inflation with, for
example, the data on the PCE deflator. The results in table 2 show that it is dangerous to do
so since as much as 85 percent of the movements in the PCE deflator are driven by changes
in the relatives prices of different goods. For some questions, it might be better to compare
the predictions of these models with our estimated series for pure inflation.
Two common approaches to strip relative-price movements from inflation are to
exclude the prices of food and energy or to look at the median inflation across the different
sectors. The next two rows in table 2 shows that these rough attempts at controlling for
relative-price changes go in the right direction but remain quite far from excluding all
relative-price changes. Core inflation is less closely tied to the relative-price index and more

24

related to pure inflation, but the squared coherences are still only slightly different, 69
percent and 21 percent respectively. For median CPI inflation, the idiosyncratic component
is higher, but the two aggregate components are also only slightly lower.
The last section of table 2 summarizes the distribution of variance decompositions for
the 187 sectoral inflation rates. Looking at the 25th and 75th quartile, the relative-price index
accounts for between 15 percent and 42 percent of the overall variability of sectoral inflation
rates, and pure inflation between 2 percent and 8 percent. As expected, the idiosyncratic
relative-price shocks account for a much bigger share of sectoral price movements than they
do for aggregate inflation measures. More remarkable, at the median, almost 1/3 of relativeprice movements at the sectoral level are accounted for by the aggregate measures of pure
inflation and the 2-dimensional relative-price index. Using sectoral price data, these findings
confirm a result found for different macroeconomic datasets, countries, and time periods: a
few aggregate factors (in our case three) can account for a large share of the variability in the
economy (Stock and Watson, 1989, 2005, Forni et al, 2000).

B. Components of Inflation and other Observables
Table 3 compares the 2-dimensional index of relative prices with several
conventional measures of relative-price changes. In the first row is the change in the price of
durables relative to the headline PCE. The squared canonical coherence of this measure of
relative prices with the relative price factors is high, around 0.5, but this single indicator falls
short of capturing all of the variability in relative prices. The next two rows look at the
relative prices of non-durables and services. The link between these and the two relativeprice factors is higher, but they are still quite far from being a comprehensive indicator for
relative-price changes. The next two rows show the relative price of food and energy,

25

popular measures of relative-price shocks in the macro literature. These are still statistically
significant, but they perform significantly worse. In spite of the attention devoted to the
price of energy, Table 3 suggests that it can account for only roughly one third of the
relative-price shocks hitting the U.S. economy at business cycle frequencies.
Figure 4 illustrates these results by showing the projection of the change in the
relative prices of services and energy onto 2 leads and lags of Rˆ t , the estimated vector of
relative price factors. For services, the regression’s adjusted R2 is 0.56, but for energy it falls
to 0.22. Both series can deviate quite significantly from the relative-price index, but energy
prices provide a particularly poor fit to the aggregate movements in relative prices.
Table 3 indicates that combining food and energy captures a larger share of the
movements in relative prices, but still only comparable to the share accounted for by
services. Finally, the resulting 4-dimensional index of relative prices (durables, nondurables,
food and energy) can only account for at most 87 percent of the variability of relative prices
captured by the two relative-price factors. These results suggest that, given its parsimony
and comprehensiveness, the two relative-price factors estimated from the statistical model
provide a useful summary of relative-price shocks in the U.S. economy.
The bottom panel of Table 3 investigates the correlation of pure inflation with
measures of monetary policy and the term spread. Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz
(1963) famously observed that in the long run, money growth and inflation are tightly linked.
Equally famously, Irving Fisher (1930) and many that followed showed that there is an
almost as strong link between nominal interest rates and inflation in the long run. At
business-cycle frequencies though, these correlations are much weaker. The correlation
between money growth and inflation is unstable and typically low (Stock and Watson, 1999),
while the correlation between inflation and nominal interest rates is typically higher, but well
below its level at lower-frequencies (Frederic S. Mishkin, 1992). Panel b of Table 3 shows
26

the average squared coherence of pure inflation and measures of money growth (M0, M1,
and M2) and different short-term nominal interest rates (the federal funds rate and the 3month Treasury bill rate). The correlation between money growth and pure inflation is very
close to zero for all measures. The correlation between nominal interest rates and pure
inflation is significantly higher and statistically significant at conventional significance
levels, especially at business-cycle frequencies.

These correlations are much like

correlations found by other researchers using overall measures of inflation. The final row of
Table 3 shows the correlation of pure inflation with the term spread (the difference between
to yield on 10-year Treasury bonds and 3-month Treasury bills), where the results look much
like the results for short-term rates.
In terms of the model of section II, these estimates again provide useful information
on the relative size of different shocks. Identifying some sectors in the model with services,
non-durables, food or energy, the results in panel (a) of table 3 provide information on the
relative size of the sectoral-specific productivity shocks. In turn, the results in panel (b) of
the table indicate the relative weight of anticipated monetary shocks vis-à-vis unanticipated
monetary shocks and fiscal shocks.

V. The Phillips Correlation

One of the most famous correlations in macroeconomics, due to Phillips (1958),
relates changes in prices with measures of real activity. The first panel of table 4 displays the
Phillips correlation using our measures of squared coherence. At business-cycle frequencies,
measuring inflation with the PCE deflator and real activity with GDP, the average squared
coherence (R2) is 0.28, corresponding to a “correlation” of roughly 0.5.

The Phillips

correlations for industrial production, consumption, employment or the unemployment rate

27

are all similarly large.
The second and third panels in table 4 show that the usual controls for relative prices
reduce the strength of this correlation. Controlling for intertemporal relative prices (using
short-term interest rates and stock returns), for the relative price of labor and consumption
(using real wages), or for the relative price of domestic and foreign goods (using the real
exchange rate) cuts the Phillips correlations in approximately half. Still, these correlations
remain quantitatively large and statistically significant.
The fourth and fifth panels in table 4 include instead two of the conventional
measures of relative prices that we discussed in the previous section. Controlling for food
and energy relative prices, the Phillips curve relation falls significantly, but the squared
coherences remain sizeable and at least 0.10 for two of the five real series. Including all four
relative-price indicators drives down the Phillips relation to between 0.03 and 0.08 (although
with four relative price series included in the VAR used to estimate the coherences, one
might conjecture that some of this decline is associated with over-fitting).
The last panel of table 4 introduces as controls instead the two relative price factors
from the estimated model. Strikingly, controlling for ρt, the Phillips correlation disappears
over business cycle frequencies. The largest squared coherence point estimate between PCE
inflation and measures or real activity, controlling for our relative-price index, is 0.03 and the
point estimates are statistically insignificant at the 10 percent level for all measures of real
activity.

Apparently, the empirical regularity that Phillips first brought attention to is

essentially entirely explained by the two relative-price factors.
Table 5 provides a different perspective by decomposing the Phillips relation into the
inflation components that we have separated. The first panel shows that removing the
idiosyncratic sources of inflation variation makes the Phillips relation much stronger than it
was with headline PCE inflation. At business-cycle frequencies, the squared coherence

28

between the aggregate components of inflation and measures of real activity is as high as 70
percent, and it is highly statistically significant at conventional significance levels. The
second panel controls for the relative-price index, so it shows the squared coherence between
pure inflation and measures of real activity. Again, controlling for relative prices essentially
eliminates the Phillips correlation, with the squared coherences falling by a factor of roughly
one-seventh. According to the model in section II, the little that remains of the relation
between pure inflation and real activity could be due to omitted relative prices like wages.
Panels (c) and (d) control for real wages, asset prices and exchange rates, which cuts the
squared coherences a little further.
The results in these tables suggest that a large part of the Phillips correlation, that has
puzzled macroeconomists for half a century, is explained by changes in good’s relative
prices. Changes in the unit of account, as captured by pure inflation, do not seem to affect
real variables, consistent with anticipated money shocks accounting for most of pure
inflation. However, note that a few of the estimates in table 5 are statistically significant,
even if small, even after controlling for other relative prices. This suggests that some money
illusion may be present, although it seems to explain very little of the variability of real
activity.

VI. The Robustness of the Results

Table 6 investigates the robustness of the key empirical conclusions to four aspects of
the model specification: (i) the number of estimated factors, (ii) the method for estimating the
factors (signal extraction using the parametric factor model (5)-(7) versus principal
components on (4)), (iii) the imposition of unit roots in the factor VAR for the parametric
model, and (iv) the number of lags and imposition of unit roots in the VAR spectral estimator

29

used to compute the various coherence estimates. The table focuses on seven key results
described below.
The first row of the table shows results for the benchmark model, where the first
column provides details of the factor estimates and where “(1,1,0)” denotes a parametric k=3
factor model where the first and second factor are I(1) processes and the third is I(0). The
next column, labeled “VAR”, summarizes the specification of the VAR used to compute the
spectral estimates, which for the benchmark model involves 4 lags of (at, Rt) with at and the
first element of Rt entered as first differences (D,4).
Results shown in the column labeled (1) are for the fraction of the business cycle
variability of headline PCE inflation explained by the relative price factors () and pure
inflation (v); for the benchmark model these are taken from the first row of Table 2. Results
shown in the column labeled (2) are the average squared canonical coherences between the
relative inflation factors Rt and relative inflation rates for durables, nondurables, food, and
energy (benchmark model from Table 3, panel a, final row). Columns (3) and (4) show the
average squared coherence between pure inflation and the growth rate of M2 and the 3month Treasury bill rate (benchmark model from Table 3, panel b, rows 3 and 5). Column
(5) shows the average coherence between real GDP and headline PCE inflation after
controlling for the estimated relative inflation factors (benchmark model, Table 4, panel f,
first row). The final two columns show the fraction of business cycle variability explained
by the factors (at, Rt) (Column 6) and the fraction explained by pure inflation, vt (benchmark
models results from Table 5, row 1 of panels a and b).
Looking across the entries in the table, the key quantitative conclusions from Tables
2-5 appear to be robust to the changes in specification studied in Table 6. From column (1),
relative inflation factors explain a significant fraction of the business cycle variability of
aggregate inflation (as measured by the headline PCE deflator), while pure inflation (v)
30

explains a smaller, but non-negligible fraction.

Observable measures of relative price

inflation are reasonably highly correlated with one of the relative inflation factors (the first
canonical coherence is roughly 0.90), but less highly correlated with the other factor (the
other canonical coherences are generally less than 0.50). For all of the specifications the
estimates of pure inflation are very weakly correlated with M2, but more highly correlated
with nominal interest rates. Finally, in all of the specifications, controlling for the relative
inflation factors essentially eliminates the correlation between PCE inflation and real GDP
(column 5), and, while the estimated factors are highly correlated with real GDP (column 6),
the pure inflation factor is very weakly correlated with real GDP (column 7).

VII. What Have we Done and Why Does it Matter?

In this paper, we decomposed the quarterly change in sectoral goods’ prices into
three components: pure inflation, an aggregate relative-price index, and idiosyncratic relative
prices.

We used different estimation techniques and specifications to estimate these

components, proposed a simple method to compute their correlations with other
macroeconomic variables, and presented a stylized structural model that showed how these
components relate to different economic shocks.
Our first finding was that pure inflation, the relative-price index, and conventional
measures of inflation, like the PCE deflator or its core version, can all differ markedly. Pure
inflation is smoother and less volatile than the others, and much of the low-frequency swings
in standard inflation measures are associated with changes in relative prices.

More

concretely, a large part of the increase in inflation in the early 1970s and the decrease in
inflation in the 1990s was associated with changes in relative prices, while some of the
increase in the late 1970s and the decrease in inflation in the early 1980s was associated with

31

changes in pure inflation.
Second, we found that aggregate shocks account for roughly 90 percent of the
variability of aggregate inflation, and a still sizable 1/3 of the variability of sectoral inflation
rates. Within aggregate shocks, the relative-price index dominates, but pure inflation is also
quantitatively significant, accounting for 15-20 percent of the variability in inflation
measured by conventional price indices, like the PCE deflator, the GDP deflator, or the CPI.
This finding has at least two implications for the work of economic theorists building models
to explain inflation. First, it shows that comparing the predictions of one-good models with
common measures of inflation is flawed. Changes in the relative prices of goods are large
enough that they can easily lead to mistakenly accepting or rejecting models that ignore this
feature of the data. Second, our estimates provide statistics that can be used to calibrate the
relative variances of anticipated versus unanticipated shocks, and aggregate versus sectoral
shocks.
Our third finding was that conventional measures of relative-price inflation, such as
the relative inflation of non-durables, food and energy, or combinations of several of them,
all fall short of capturing most of the relative-price inflation in the data. Our 2-dimensional
relative-price index provides a parsimonious yet comprehensive measure of relative-price
inflation that we hope will be useful in other studies that either need to statistically control
for relative-price changes, or that seek to provide economic models of the main sources of
relative-price movements. Pure inflation is only partly related to monetary policy variables.
The link to the growth rate in monetary aggregates is weak, but the correlation with nominal
interest rates at business cycle frequencies is stronger (approximately 0.5).
Our most striking finding was perhaps that, once we controlled for the two relative
price factors, the Phillips correlation became quantitatively insignificant. Therefore, the
correlation between real quantity variables and nominal inflation variables observed in the

32

data can be accounted for by changes in goods’ relative prices. This implies that models that
break the classical dichotomy via nominal rigidities in good’s price adjustment are likely
more promising than models that rely on money illusion on the part of agents. Moreover,
changes in the relative prices of labor and intertemporal prices were less successful in
explaining the Phillips correlation, suggesting a less important role for rigidities in the labor
and asset markets.
To conclude, the distinction between absolute and relative prices is a central one in
economic theory. Models of inflation have strong predictions on the relative sizes of pure
and relative-price inflation and on what accounts for the Philips correlation. However,
separating absolute and relative-price movements is naturally difficult, since the two
concepts themselves are more a fruit of thought experiments than something easily observed.
As a result, there have been few systematic attempts to measure and separate them in the
data. The goal of this paper was to make some progress on this decomposition and on
understanding its effects. Our estimates are certainly not perfect. We hope, however, that
they are sufficiently accurate that future research can look deeper into the time-series and the
moments that we provide, and that by stating the challenges and putting forward a
benchmark, we can motivate future research to come up with better estimators. Likewise, we
are sure that our findings will not settle the debates around the Phillips correlation. Our more
modest hope is that they offer a new perspective on how to bring data to bear on this longstanding question.

Notes: The first column describes the factor estimates, where the parametric estimates
are based on signal extraction applied to (5)-(7) with parameters estimated by Gaussian
MLE, and the numbers in parenthesis indicate the number of factors and whether the
relevant factor is modeled as an I(1) or I(0) process. For example, “(1,1,0)” is a three
factor model modeled as I(1), I(1), and I(0) processes. PC-k denotes a k-factor model
estimated by principal components. The column labeled VAR shows the specification of
the VAR used to compute the VAR-spectral estimates, where “D” and “L” denote first
differences and levels specifications and the numbers 4 and 6 denote the number of lags
in the VAR. Results shown in the column (1) are the average squared coherences
between Headline PC and t and vt (benchmark model results from Table 2 first row); (2)
canonical coherences between the relative prices of (Durables, Nondurables, Food,
Energy) and Rt (benchmark model results from Table 3 row 7); (3) coherence between
M2 and v (Table 3 row 10); (4) coherence between Federal Funds Rate and vt (Table 3
row 11); (5) coherence between PCE Inflation and GDP controlling for Rt (Table 4, panel
f, row 1); (6) coherence between vt + t and GDP (Table 5, panel a, row 1), and (7)
between vt and GDP (Table 5, panel b, row 1).

from

Quarterly

inflation rates were computed using the first difference of logarithms of the price indices
for the last month of the quarter. Inflation observations that differed from the series
median by more than six times the interquartile range were replaced by the local median
computed using the six adjacent observations. The table below shows the price index
from the NIPA table, the series description, the standard deviation of the (outlieradjusted) series over 1959:2-2006:2 and the 2005 PCE expenditure share. To save space,
the final four columns of this table are used to show the estimated parameters from the
benchmark 3-factor model.

A.2 Solving the restricted least squares problem in (6)
To solve the least squares problem in (6), notice that (i) if at were known, the least
squares problem could be solved by computing principal components for variables
zit  wi ( it  at ) and (ii) if i′Rt were known, the least squares estimator of at could be

computed from the weighted least squares of it – i′Rt onto a constant. We iterated
between these two steps to solve (6).
A.3 State-space representation of the dynamic factor model, the log-likelihood
function, and the EM algorithm.
Let B be an NxN diagonal matrix with i on the diagonal, let p be the order of the
VAR, and let the N×1 vector yt = t – Bt–1 – c. Then, the unobserved-components
model in (7)-(9) can be written in state-space form as:
(A.1)

yt = Hst + et

(A.2)

st = Fst–1 + Gt

where, st = ( x 't x 't-1 … x 't-p +1 )' with xt = (at Rt´)´ a k×1 vector, and:

and

. The Gaussian log-likelihood for the unknown parameters conditional on

{y t }Tt 2 can be computed using the Kalman filter innovations and their variances as

described in Hamilton (1993, Chapter 13).
The EM algorithm is a well-known approach (Watson and Engle, 1983, Shumway
and Stoffer, 1982) to maximize the Gaussian log-likelihood function for state-space
problems. The method is convenient here because it straightforward to compute the
52

expected value of the “complete data” ({yt, st}) sufficient statistics conditional on the
observed data ({yt}), and because maximization of the complete data Gaussian likelihood
follows from familiar regression formulae. The standard linear regression formulae are
modified in two ways to estimate the parameters in (A.1)-(A.2).

First, Gauss-

Seidel/Cochrane-Orcutt iterations are used to estimate B conditional on c and Γ, and c
and Γ conditional on B. Second, Γ is estimated subject to the constraint l´Γ = 0 using the
standard restricted least squares formula, in order to impose the normalization that we
used.
While there are many parameters to estimate (971 in the benchmark model), there
are two features of the model that make estimation feasible. First, while N is large,
because R is diagonal, the sufficient statistics for the complete data likelihood can be
computed in O(Tm) calculations, where m is the dimension of the state vector s. Second,
because N and T are large, the principal component estimators of (at Rt´) are reasonably
accurate and regression based estimators of the model parameters can be constructed
using these estimates of the factors. These principal component based estimates serve as
useful initial values for the MLE algorithm. (See Doz, Giannone and Reichlin, 2008, for
further discussion.) Results reported in the text are based on 40,000 EM iterations,
although results using 5,000 iterations are essentially identical.
A.4 MLEs for the benchmark model

A.5 Estimating υt and t
Recall that υt = at – E ( at | {R τ }T 1 ) . We estimate υt using the inflation data, that is
we construct E(υt| { i }iN1,,T 1 ). One way to construct this estimate is to note that the
projection E ( at | {R τ }T 1 ) can be computed from the Kalman smoother of at from a state
space system with state equation given by (A.2) and observation equation given by Rt =
[0 Ik 0(k,

(k+1)p)]st.

That is, the Kalman smoother implicitly computes the projection

coefficients, say , for the equation E ( at | {R τ }T1 )    1 β t,τ R τ , so that υt = at –
T



T
1

βt,τ R τ . From the law of iterated expectations

E(υt| { i }iN1,,T 1 ) = E(at| { i }iN1,,T 1 ) –



T
1

β t,τ E (R τ |{ i }iN1,,T 1 ) . As a practical matter this

can be computed in two steps:
Step 1: Use the Kalman smoother applied to (A.1) and (A.2) to compute the
smoothed estimates of at and Rt given { i }iN1,,T 1 . Call these estimates at/T and Rt/T.
Step 2: Construct



T
1

β t,τ R τ/T as the smoothed estimate of at from a state-space

model with observation equation Rt/T = [0 Ik 0(k,

(k+1)p)]st

and state transition equation

(A.2). Then E(υt| { i }iN1,,T 1 ) is the smoothed estimate of at from Step 1 minus its
smoothed estimate from Step 2.
Similarly, recall that t = E[Ft | {Rτ }T1 ], which we estimate as E(t| { i }iN1,,T 1 ).
From (2) Ft = (′)–1′lat + (′)–1′Rt. The component of the projection of Ft onto
{Rτ }T1 that depends on at can be computed from the smoothed estimate of at in step 2.

The component that depends directly on Rt can be computed from the smoothed estimate
of Rt from step 1.

A.6 Calculating the Average Squared Coherences shown in the tables
Consider a VAR for a vector of variables Xt written as (L)Xt = t, where var(t)
= . The spectral density of X at frequency  is given by S() = (e-i)–1(ei)′–1.

54

The squared coherence between the Xit and Xjt at frequency  is cohij ( ) 

Sij ( )

2

Sii ( ) S jj ( )

,

which is recognized at the frequency domain analogue of the squared correlation between
the variables. Similarly, the squared coherence between Xit and Xjt , controlling from Xkt
at frequency  is cohij  k ( ) 
1

Sij  k ( )

2

Sii  k ( ) S jj  k ( )

, where Sij  k ( ) = Sij() – Sik()Skk()–

Skj(), and Sii  k ( ) and S jj  k ( ) are defined analogously.
Estimates of these coherences were computed by estimating the VAR parameters

in (L) and , and then plugging these estimates into the formula above. The average
coherences reported in the tables are averages of the coherences over a fine grid of
frequencies in the desired frequency band. Finally, standard errors were computed using
the delta method and the asymptotic covariance matrix of the estimated VAR parameters.

A.7 Solution of the model in section 3
The representative agent’s satisfies the conditions for Gorman aggregation, so it
can be split into two stages. The optimal choice of how much of each variety to consume
implies the optimality conditions:
(A.3)

Cit  Ct ( Pit / Pt )   and Cit ( j )  Cit ( Pit ( j ) / Pit )   ,

(A.4)

and Pt   N 1  Pit1 



.

These imply that St = PtCt. Log-linearizing the static cost-of-living price indices around
the steady state where all the prices are the same leads to:

(A.5)

N

i 1

pt  N 1  pit and pit   pit ( j )dj

The second-stage optimality conditions for the representative consumer are:

limi   t i Et 
0
 (1  Tt i )Wt i 

where zt is the Lagrange multiplier on the cash-in-advance constraint (15). The first
condition is the static labor supply condition equating the marginal utility of consumption
divided by its price to the marginal disutility of labor divided by its after-tax wage plus zt
reflecting the tightening of the cash-in-advance constraint that comes with consuming
more. The second condition is the standard Euler equation, equating the marginal utility
of an extra dollar today from working to its discounted expected value tomorrow, which
also includes the relaxation of the budget constraint that comes with holding money as
savings. Third, we have the complementary slackness condition associated with the
constraint, and fourth the transversality condition.
We conjecture that, in equilibrium, the cash-in-advance constraint holds at all
dates and states, so zt > 0 always. To verify the conjecture, note that it implies that in
equilibrium PC
t t  M t . Combining the first two optimality conditions in (A.6), we obtain
an expression for zt  1   Et  M t / M t 1   / M t , which given the assumption on m
verifies the conjecture. Using the result for zt on the first optimality condition gives an
expression for the real wage, which after taking logs and ignoring constants is:
(A.7)

wt  pt  yt  lt  ln(1  Tt ) .

Turning to the problem of the firm, using the production function to replace out Lit(j), the
demand for each variety in (A.3) to substitute out Cit(j), and the market clearing condition
in the goods market to replace Ct for Yt, real profits are:
1

Maximizing this expression, taking logs and ignoring constants, the price charged by an
56

attentive firm in sector i is:


1
pit* ( j )  pt  
  ( wt  pt )  (1  ) yt  xit ( j )
    (1   ) 

(A.9)

The desired price rises one-to-one with the price index, and increases with marginal
costs, which rise with the price of the labor input, rise with output because of diminishing
returns to scale, and fall with higher productivity. Only i of the firms actually set
pit ( j )  pit* ( j ) with the remaining 1  i choosing, up to a first-order log-linear

approximation, the certainty-equivalent pit ( j )  Eˆ  pit* ( j )  .
Finally, integrating over j the prices set by the firms, using the definition of pit in
(A.5), and substituting out wages using equation (A.7), we obtain the solution in (20),
where the parameters are:  1     (1   ) and   (1   ) . The cash-in-advance
constraint combined with market clearing in the goods market implies equation (22), and
the first equation in (A.5) is (21).
Turning to the solutions for πit and yt, start by defining a new variable qt = pt +
αyt. Taking the Eˆ (.) operator over both sides of (A.9) and substituting out for real wages
gives: Eˆ  pit   Eˆ  qt   xt   t    xit  xt   . Taking the average over N, using the
process for xit(j) in (17), using the price index equation in (21), and ignoring constants:

Eˆ  pt   Eˆ  qt    t   t 1 . Then, using the definition of qt and (22), qt= αmt + (1α)pt,

so

substituting

the

expression,

we

find:

Now, using the quantity theory

relation (22), it follows that: Eˆ ( yt )   ( /  ) t   t 1 . Moreover, one gets:

By going through the same steps, one solves for the “news” part qt  Eˆ  qt  , and
again taking the same steps find:

Adding the two parts of each solution, taking first-differences of the solution for prices to
obtain πit, and using the definitions of the three components of price changes gives the
expressions in (23)-(26).
