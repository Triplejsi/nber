ABSTRACT
This paper investigates the relationship between the size of interest groups in terms of voter representation
and the interest group's campaign contributions to politicians. We uncover a robust hump-shaped relationship
between the voting share of an interest group and its contributions to a legislator. This pattern is rationalized
in a simultaneous bilateral bargaining model where the larger size of an interest group affects the amount
of surplus to be split with the politician (thereby increasing contributions), but is also correlated with
the strength of direct voter support the group can offer instead of monetary funds (thereby decreasing
contributions). The model yields simple structural equations that we estimate at the district level employing
data on individual and PAC donations and local employment by sector. This procedure yields estimates
of electoral uncertainty and politicians effectiveness as perceived by the interest groups. Our approach
also implicitly delivers a novel method for estimating the impact of campaign spending on election
outcomes: we find that an additional vote costs a politician between 100 and 400 dollars depending
on the district.

Introduction

The role played by special interest groups in shaping policy-making is hard to ignore. One simple
reason is the considerable size of the amounts the special interest groups (SIGs) inject into the
political system. During the 1999-2000 election cycle the first 50 donor industries disbursed to
incumbents of the 106th Congress a cumulated $368, 438, 170, about the size of the GDP of a (not
so) small developing economy. In the 2005-2006 election cycle the first 50 donor industries disbursed
the 109th Congress $444, 505, 353. Much research eﬀort has gone towards understanding the way in
which special interest groups (SIGs) aﬀect the political process and policy formulation, if and how
SIGs buy influence. In particular, within this literature one specific path has been to investigate the
importance of campaign contributions by SIGs to politicians who value such donations as inputs
that increase their probability of electoral success.
One aspect that has received little attention along this path of research is that, since the probability of being (re-)elected ultimately depends on the number of votes a politician can attract,
the legislator should take into account both the electoral strength of an interest group (i.e. the
share of voting population it represents) and its contributing possibilities when deciding whether
to support or not legislation in favor of such group.1 On the one hand, SIGs that represent a large
number of voters in a district also benefit more from a given policy and therefore might contribute
more. On the other hand, such interest groups might be required to make fewer contributions if
they can pledge voter support.2 The ability of employers to aﬀect the electoral orientation of their
1

The power of firms in terms of voter representation has been at the center of discussion following a recent move by

Wal-Mart: “In August, Wal-Mart distributed a letter to its employees in Iowa and three other states, highlighting what
it said were inaccuracies in criticism by Governor Tom Vilsack, as well as Senators Evan Bayh of Indiana and Joseph
Biden of Delaware and New Mexico’s Governor Bill Richardson. The letter encouraged employees to talk to ‘friends,
neighbours and family about the good that Wal-Mart does’. It also promised that the company would ‘keep you informed
about what these political candidates are saying about your company while on the campaign trail’. Wal-Mart has also
highlighted the significant number of its employees in both swing states. In Ohio its 50,000 workers represent roughly 1
per cent of voters in the 2004 presidential election, enough to be a factor in the current Senate battle between Sherrod
Brown - a Wal-Mart critic - and Mike DeWine, the Republican incumbent. Wal-Mart’s political action committee is
also one of the largest corporate donors to Mr DeWine’s campaign.” (Financial Times - September 30, 2006)
2
The idea that politicians may accept lower contributions by firms that represent a large number of voters is
clearly expressed in the following interview to Representative Guy Vander Jagt (R-Michigan): “I have one Fortune
500 company in my district that was so fuddy-duddy that they would never ever, ever do anything to help me. If their
plane was going back to Michigan, they wouldn’t let me ride on it. And that was before we got all these rules in.
Nobody would do it now [accept a ride on a corporate jet], but back then, everyone would do it. When the Washington
Senators were still here, instead of [this company] getting me tickets, I’d scramble around and get them tickets. In
other words, I could not have been treated more shabbily in terms of anything they might do for me. And yet I always

are voting on issues of concern to their sector.

3

This turns out to be a quantitatively important mechanism at play in the data. The main
contribution of the paper is to show that the number of voters represented by interest groups is an
important variable in explaining the pattern of campaign contributions. The data indicate that an
inverted-U shape describes the relationship between the share of voters represented by an interest
group and the contributions to a legislator.
As a departure point, the paper exploits the variation in economic structure across US states
and congressional districts to investigate the relationship between the electoral strength of a given
interest group and the political contributions to a given politician. For each US House Representative and each Senator, we match PAC and individual contributions by each economic interest group
(e.g. tobacco, insurance, steel producers, textiles) to the number of employees in the corresponding
sector.4 We find that, within each Congressional District and each State, an inverted-U describes
the relationship between campaign contributions and the number of employees in the sector represented by the corresponding interest group. At low employment levels (i.e. fewer voters), interest
group contributions to the politician increase with the number of employees in a sector. At higher
employment levels the interest group contributions decrease with the number of employees. Indeed,
the data show that the largest employers are practically never the largest contributors. This pattern
knocked myself out for them because they were the biggest employer in that county. Their health was essential to the
health of my constituents, the people who worked there.” - Speaking Freely by Martin Schram for the Center for
Responsive Politics (1995, First Edition)
The following quote by Senator Dennis DeConcini (D-Arizona) clarifies further the concept: “If I get a contribution
from, say, Allied-Signal, a big defense contractor, and they’ve raised money for me. And then they come in and say,
‘Senator, we need legislation that would extend some rule of contracting that’s good for us.’ They lay out the case.
My staﬀ goes over it. I’m trying to help them. Why am I trying to help them? The cynic can say: ‘Well, it’s because
they gave you 5,000 bucks. And if you ran again, they’ll give you another 5,000 bucks.’ Or is it because they have
15,000 jobs in Arizona and this will help keep those jobs in Arizona? Now to me, the far greater motivation is those
jobs, because those are the people that are going to vote for me. But I can’t ignore the fact that they have given me
money... Now the ideal situation is if I was motivated only by the jobs and the merits and there was no money here that’s the way it ought to be - or if the money was so minimal that nobody would think it was a factor. If I could only
spend a half a million dollars in a Senate campaign and they could only give me $1,000, it would not be a factor.”

In 2004 NAM reports “By Election Day, the program reached more than 19 million employees, delivered more than
40 million messages and helped 1.7 million employees with voter registration and early ballot information.”

It seems reasonable to proxy the number of voters an interest group represents with the number of employees in
the sector.

is robust to a battery of specifications and controls and, to the best of our knowledge, has not been
explored before in the literature on political contributions. Furthermore, we believe this framework
highlights a channel of influence at work in a wider sample than the one we consider here. For
instance, several surveys of legislators indicate AARP as the most influential special interest group
in Washington. AARP gives $0 of political contributions by statute. These two facts cannot be
reconciled by standard models of lobbying, but they are rationalized in the framework we present,
given the large fraction of voters represented by the elderly.
From a theoretical standpoint, we interpret the evidence by modeling the interaction between
heterogenous interest groups in a district and a politician in a simultaneous bilateral bargaining
framework, which illustrates the eﬀects of interest group size on the amount of campaign contributions. Each interest group bargains with its representative over the latter’s support for a policy
favorable to the SIG and over the amount of contributions and voter support by the interest group.
The politician is interested in ensuring support because it faces electoral uncertainty and aims at
increasing the probability of winning by trading legislation support for (i) a guaranteed number of
votes by individuals members of the SIG’s and (ii) contributions that are then employed to aﬀect
the decision of impressionable voters through advertising. The size of the interest group aﬀects
the bargaining because: (i) a larger interest group benefits more from a given favorable policy and
must therefore give larger contributions, (ii) a larger interest group can ensure the legislator a wide
support in the sense of persuading the voters it represents to vote in favor of the politician and
therefore it might not be required to contribute as much, if it suﬃciently increases the probability
of winning of the politician by just committing the support of its members.
The model delivers a structural relationship between votes and contributions, which we estimate,
thus obtaining a measure of the rate at which politicians transform contributions into votes, of the
degree of electoral uncertainty, and of the implicit ability of politicians to support legislation in
favor of interest groups. We employ our results to make four points.
First, according to our parameter estimates, each politician expects to be spending between
$100 and $400 in order to assure an additional vote through advertising and other forms of campaigning. Levitt (1994) finds that campaign spending has a small impact on electoral outcomes5 ,
or equivalently, that to obtain on average one more vote politicians need to spend a large amount
of money. Interpreting Levitt’s estimates in this direction yields a cost of $130 − $390 per vote.
Our estimates, though the result of a diﬀerent empirical approach, are of the same magnitude.
5

The impact is also not significantly positive, but here we simply make use of his point estimates to illustrate the

comparison.

4

Second, we relate our estimates of the cost of a vote to the density of population finding that
more urbanized districts have a higher cost of votes. This result is consistent with findings in
Stratmann (2004), who reports that some districts have a higher cost of media advertising. If we
think that cities like New York have both high density and high cost of media advertising then the
positive correlation we obtain can be rationalized.
Third, the estimates of ex ante electoral uncertainty are compared to measures of lopsidedness
using ex-post vote margins. We find that in districts where electoral races are closer (ex-post victory
margin is thin) our estimates indicate higher ex-ante uncertainty. Analogously, for races that are
considered more lopsided our estimates indicate lower ex-ante variance.
Fourth, by considering the electoral support oﬀered by an interest group along with its contributions, we are able to recalculate the return to political ‘investment’, broadly defined and we assess
its magnitude. Ansolabehere, de Figueiredo and Snyder (2003) provide a comprehensive review of
the discussion surrounding the question of whether returns to political contributions are too high
(implying that contributions should be several orders of magnitude higher) or too low (implying
that we should observe very little contributions). The very nature of this question presupposes
that contributions are similar to an investment decision and that interest groups are buying favors
at some implicit price. The conclusion that Ansolabehere et al. reach is that if contributions
were truly an investment decision then we should observe higher levels of monetary support, as
their returns appear considerably higher than other types of investment. Therefore, they claim,
contributions must rather be a form of consumption. We argue that in order to calculate the return to contributions one needs to take into account that interest groups give votes (which can be
translated into money) and money.6 The method we propose delivers considerably lower (and more
reasonable) returns.
Relation to previous literature
The literature on campaign financing is vast.7 The models that have been proposed in the
literature attribute to political contributions diﬀerent motivations and consequences. We will focus
on those papers that are more relevant to this study here, with the full knowledge that this review
is far from complete.
Various theoretical models have identified reasons why contributions are given and how they
are used. According to these models contributions are given in order to (i) aﬀect the policy choice
6

So an extra dollar would earn return on a larger denominator and not the return found by simply dividing the

value of political favors by the amount of dollar contributions.

of an incumbent government (Grossman and Helpman, 19948 ), (ii) to influence the platform of
political candidates (Grossman and Helpman, 19969 ), (iii) to increase the likelihood of election of a
candidate with a given (i.e. non-flexible) favorable position (Grossman and Helpman, 1996; Morton
and Myerson, 1992) or (iv) to buy access (Austen-Smith, 1995). Politicians find those contributions
useful because campaign spending can be used to inform voters of a candidate position (AustenSmith, 1987) or to convince them of the candidate’s quality (Coate, 2004).
Empirical studies of mechanisms (i) and (ii) have found some eﬀect of contributions on voting
behavior on specific pieces of legislation10 although others have not.11 In this paper, we assume
contributions are valued by politicians and therefore aﬀect legislators’ votes on certain bills. Eﬀect
(iii) is hard to distinguish empirically from eﬀect (ii), but many studies have nevertheless tried
to assess the impact of a given candidate spatial position on the contributions raised (Poole and
Romer, 1985; Poole, Romer and Rosenthal, 1987; McCarty and Poole,1998). Ansolabehere, Snyder,
and Tripathi (2002) and references therein discuss eﬀect (iv)12 .
Whether the politicians’ perception that contributions can indeed aﬀect voters decisions is
justified has been the subject of very close empirical scrutiny. This literature has pursued the
goal of quantifying the impact of campaign spending on the share of votes obtained in the election
(Jacobson, 1978; Green and Krasno, 1988, Palda and Palda, 1998). The diﬃcult task faced by
this literature has been to control for other variables that aﬀect electoral outcomes and that might
therefore bias the estimate of the impact of spending. A few studies have addressed this issue
using diﬀerent techniques and obtaining diﬀerent results (Levitt, 1994; Milligan and Rekkas, 2006,
Erikson and Palfrey, 1998). This paper is not going to address the issue directly, but it oﬀers an
implicit way of estimating the monetary value of a vote, which is just another way of expressing
how much money is needed to ‘influence’ an additional voter. Our methodology, using withindistrict data, is not subject to bias coming from unobserved candidate characteristics because such

Grossman and Helpman (1994) study the impact of political contribution on trade policy determination, but the

electoral process is not modeled and contributions are assumed to increase the utility of politicians.
9
In Grossman and Helpman (1996) political candidates have a given position on some issues, but their platform on
other topics can be aﬀected by contributions (valued as a tool to gather votes). Interest groups have two goals in giving
contributions: influencing the platform of candidates and aﬀecting the probability of winning of those candidates that
are ex-ante aligned with them. In this paper, policy is taken to be exogenously given for the individual candidate,
who has the choice of supporting it or not. This is a realistic assumption when we analyze the case of an individual
politician during a given legislature.

characteristics are constant at the district level. Admittedly we cannot perform the same exercise
as the previous studies, but we can obtain an estimate for the implicit cost of a vote that is free of
individual candidate bias.
Another strand of research has focused on identifying the strategy of interest groups in terms of
choice of timing and recipients of contributions. Several papers have found committee assignments
and constituency characteristics to be important determinants of interest group donations, both
theoretically and empirically (Grier and Munger, 1991; Denzau and Munger, 1986; Stratmann,
1991). Generally, the view in these studies is that interest groups at the national level decide
where to allocate a given amount of money according, for instance, to whether the legislator’s
constituents’ interests are or not aligned with the interest group. The view that we take in this
paper is to consider an individual politician and abstract from the national interest group allocation
problem.
There is also relevant political science research on the role of groups as vote providers and
turnout, which include both theoretical and empirical contributions. For the former, see Morton
(1987, 1991), Schram (1990), Uhlaner (1989). For the latter, see Filer, Kenny, and Morton (1993)
and Nalebuﬀ and Shachar (1999).
The study that comes closest to what we do in this paper is Stratmann (1992). Stratmann looks
at the relationship between farm PAC contributions in a given district and the fraction of farm
population in that congressional district13 . He finds that farm PAC contributions are low for those
legislators whose district has a low fraction of rural population (approximately below the median
for the country) suggesting that, according to Stratmann, those politicians are ‘too costly’ to bring
to the farm cause because they do not have support for those policies from their constituency14 .
Stratmann also finds that, conditional on the fraction being (approximately) above the median,
contributions first decrease in farm population (because politicians with larger farm constituencies
care more about farming and need to be compensated less for supporting farming-favorable policies),
but then increase. Stratmann explains that the latter eﬀect is suggestive of the fact that politicians
with large farming constituencies are the ones with the highest productivity in pushing legislation
that is pro-farming and therefore PACs that try to maximize their return should invest more heavily
in them. Although this paper primarily focuses on the interaction between a politician and interest
13

Rural fraction is used as a proxy for the fraction of population with some interest in policies favorable to

farming. This measure is also taken to proxy the position of the specific legislator about issues concerning farming,
independently of campaign contributions.

to influence the ‘least costly’ half of the legislature.

groups in his electoral district, in Section 3 we discuss the relationship between our results and
Stratmann’s regressions.
The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces the data and presents the
reduced-form evidence. Section 3 presents a model of bargaining between the legislator and interest
groups and derives a structural relationship between votes and money. Section 4 presents the
estimation procedure and the structural estimation results. Section 5 concludes.

Presentation of the data and reduced-form estimation

This section presents the data on the number of voters pertaining to each special interest group and
the amount of political contributions to each legislator by each interest group. The data come from
two sources. Data on local employment by sector are contained in the Country Business Patterns
database, an annual series15 published by the U.S. Census Bureau, which provides U.S. county-level
employment16 by 6-digit NAICS.17 The county-level data is aggregated to the congressional district
level and the state level using the MABLE-Geocorr software.18
Campaign contributions data from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) files are collected
and aggregated by the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP). The CRP classifies Political Action
Committee (PAC) contributions and individual contributions according to the industry to which the
PAC or the individual donor is associated1920 . We use the subset of groups identified by the CRP
15

The series excludes data on self-employed individuals, employees of private households, railroad employees, agri-

cultural production employees, and most government employees.
16
The Business Register database contains information about every known establishment in the United States. The
information on employment is summarized in CBP by establishment size bracket.

In this paper we employ the 1989-90 and 1999-2000 issues.
18
Supported by the Missouri Census Data Center. Whenever counties are split between two congressional districts,
we utilize the following methodology to allocate employment to the two districts. Consider county i, part of which
lies in congressional district d and part in d0 . Define as P OPid and P OPid0 the population of county i in districts d
and d0 respectively. The county-level employment in sector s, vsi is attributed to the two districts in the following

amounts: vsi P OPPidOP
and vsi P OPid +PidOP

20
Noticeably, the approach followed by the CRP may induce a form of measurement error in the data if voters’

contributions are unrelated to the economic SIGs inferred from employment data (for instance, because donors are
driven exclusively by ideological concerns). This would clearly induce attenutation bias in the data, moving against
the mechanism we present. As we report in what follows, attenuation bias does not seem to be a first-order issue,
given the quantitative strenght and precision of our estimates.
Finally, the absence of generalized information concerning aﬃliation to non-economic interest groups prevents
us from extending the analysis beyond economic SIGs. The eﬀects we describe however directly generalize to any
instance in which groups have non-zero electoral mass.

8

for which we have employment data and match the CRP interest groups to 6-digit NAICS sectors21
using the definitions reported by the U.S. Census Bureau. The 86 SIG’s and the corresponding
NAICS industries are listed in Table 1. For each SIG we have contributions to each member of the
Senate and the House of Representatives for the 101st (election cycle 1989-90) and 106th Congress
(election cycle 1999-2000). Data collected by the CRP have been extensively employed in the
politico-economic literature22 .
As additional controls, data concerning electoral districts and elections are obtained from the
Oﬃce of Clerk of the House (for election results) and the Poole and Rosenthal’s voteview data
base23 (for names, party aﬃliation, and characteristics of congressmen and senators). Finally, in
order to remove the largest outliers we winsorize contributions and number of workers at the 99th
percentile of the right-end tail of the pooled densities of each variable.
We now proceed to gauge the qualitative features of the data. Our starting point is to present
evidence of a non-monotonic, inverted-U pattern between contribution and SIG’s employment sizes.
We present evidence of this empirical regularity in Table 2. The table is divided in three sections,
corresponding to the House, the Senate, and the subgroup of Senators running for reelection at
the two sampling dates of November 2000 and 199024 respectively. The dependent variables of
interest are contributions by each SIG s in district d, which corresponds more directly to Csd ,
and, in alternative, the fraction of all contributions received by a politician from each SIG. The
independent variable, vsd , is the fraction25 of total population of total employment in district d
represented by sector s. The four specifications that we estimate in Table 2 are:
(col. 1) Csd = φ + δ 1 vsd + µsd
(col. 2) Csd = φ + δ 1 vsd + κd + ψ s + µsd
2
(col. 3) Csd = φ + δ 1 vsd + δ 2 vsd
+ µsd
2
(col. 4) Csd = φ + δ 1 vsd + δ 2 vsd
+ κd + ψ s + µsd .

The first two specifications presented account for a linear relationship between the number of voters
represented by a given SIG and its contributions to a given legislator. A parametric (quadratic)
polynomial is the simple but flexible approximation that we employ in columns (3) and (4). In

Initially from Poole and Rosenthal (1997).

The House is renewed every two years, while the Senate is staggered in electoral classes of size 1/3 every two

years. The term in oﬃce of representatives is therefore two years, relative to six years for Senators.
25
We utilize shares of total population in order to account for possible diﬀerences in the size of the diﬀerent polities.
This is not particularly important for the House, but it is relevant for the Senate.

order to partial out unobserved sector-specific and politician-specific characteristics, we pool across
districts all the observations for each branch of Congress and include both sector and legislator
fixed eﬀects. We include the fixed eﬀects in columns (2) and (4).
The linear specifications indicate a positive correlation between contributions and size of the
lobby, δ 1 > 0, that is robust to the inclusion of fixed eﬀects that is significant at standard confidence
levels. Such relationship holds for the House and the Senate in 1990 and 2000, indicating a consistent
pattern over time and across Congressional branches. As expected the relationship is stronger in
the subgroup of Senators up for reelection in November 2000.
More interestingly Table 2 shows that the pooled regression indicates a hump-shaped relationship between votes and contributions: the parameters present a positive sign on the linear term and
negative on the quadratic (δ 1 > 0 and δ 2 < 0) and are always statistically significant, whether we
include the fixed eﬀects or exclude them. In order to give quantitative intuition the table reports
also the point of maximum and the number of observations above the point of maximum of the
parabola implied by the estimated coeﬃcients. For the House the peak is located between 1.4 and 3
percent of the overall district population. In a congressional district of size approximately 600, 000
it corresponds to a SIG employing between 8, 400 and 18, 000 workers. This number is particularly
reasonable considering that the margin of victory in the 2000 House elections was on average about
80, 000 − 90, 000 voters, implying a pivotal group size around 40, 000 − 45, 000 voters. As we could
have expected, the number of observations above the point of maximum is not very large. Within
each district there are never too many relatively large voter groups (the distribution of industry
sizes is well approximated by a Pareto distribution)26 . Furthermore, understanding the behavior
of the function over the rightmost portion of the size range is important. Large employers are
particularly interesting since they cover a substantial portion of the electorate.
For the Senate the peak of the inverted-U is located between 1.1 and 3.97 percent of the
State population. Senatorial races operate over substantially larger constituencies and the number
of lobbies large enough to exercise electoral pressure could diﬀer from that for the House. This
notwithstanding, the data seem to support an hump-shaped relationship for Senatorial races as well,
especially for those Senators that had completed their fund-raising and were running for reelection
in 2000 and 1990 (part 3 of Table 2).
We now proceed in further detail conditioning along the two main dimensions of the data (by
district and by sector). Table 3(a) reports the results for the coeﬃcients of interest after removing
26

It is also mechanically impossible to have many relatively large sectors since their fractions of total employment

have to add up to one.

the assumption of common behavior of the polynomial approximation across districts, while 3(b)
reports within-sector results. Within each district we estimate the equation:
2
+ µsd ,
Csd = κd + δ d,1 vsd + δ d,2 vsd

(1)

and we consider the overall distributions of various test statistics (sign, 0.05 F-test, 0.05 and 0.10
t-tests). We find that δ d,1 > 0 and δ d,2 < 0 (i.e. the relationship between votes and contributions
exhibit an inverted-U shape) in almost all the districts27 and such pattern is significant at least at
the 10 percent level generally in half the seats for all our samples28 .
A reasonable insight that we obtain from this table is that heterogeneity across congressional
and senatorial races is quantitatively relevant. The fitted parabolas in column (1) change from
district to district considerably. For instance, albeit the estimated mean peak of the parabola for
the House in 2000 was 0.018, the standard deviation across district was almost as high (0.013).
In the section devoted to structural estimation we devote considerable attention to what specific
characteristics of the races may determine the pattern of contributions. The approach of Table
3(a) operates within politician by construction and does not allow accounting for unobserved SIG’s
characteristics that might be correlated with sector size and could be inducing certain levels of
contributions. In column (2) we control for the value added of the sector in 2000, as computed by
the Bureau of Economic Analysis, to obviate such design problem. The results of column (1) are
broadly confirmed. We can reject at 5 percent the joint hypothesis of δ 1d = 0 and δ 2d = 0 for more
than 2/3 of the districts. Column (3) of Table 3(a) repeats the analysis excluding from the sample
four particular sectors29 exhibiting often a large employment level and a low level of contributions
and that might be suspected of driving the results (notice that from column 1 and 2 an average
between 5.3 and 6.2 SIG’s locate on the declining portion of the parabola). The results do not
change substantially once we exclude those four observations. In fact, the results suggest that
there is variation on which sectors belong to the declining portion of the parabola (their number
varies between 3.7 and 5.2).
Table 3(b) reports the results for the coeﬃcients of interest after removing the assumption of
27

Congressional districts for the House and States for the Senate.
We perform three types of tests on the subset of districts that present point estimates δd,1 > 0 and δ d,2 < 0.

First we test whether we can reject the null hypothesis that jointly δ d,1 = δ d,2 = 0 at the 5% confidence level. Second
we test whether we can reject the null hypothesis that separately δ d,1 = 0 and δ d,2 = 0 at the 5% confidence level.
Finally we repeat this second test at the 10% confidence level.

common behavior of the polynomial approximation across sectors. Within each sector we estimate:
2
+ µsd ,
Csd = hs + δ s,1 vsd + δ s,2 vsd

and report tests on the signs of δ s,1 and δ s,2 similarly to the case of district-level regressions. We
find that for about two thirds of the sectors δ s,1 < 0 and δ s,2 > 0. In about half the sectors such
pattern is significant at the 10 percent level30 in the House, while the results for the Senate are less
conclusive, mostly due to the fact that we are not distinguishing between Senate seats that are up
for vote and those that are not.
An intuitive check for the nonmonotonicity documented in the previous tables is that by and
large the largest employers should not be the largest contributors both within districts and within
industries. It turns out they are not. Table 4 presents evidence of this finding. In the first panel
of Table 4 we first report the number of districts in which the largest employer in that district is
the top contributor and we find that this is the case for less than 2% of the districts31 . The second
line in the same panel reports the number of districts in which the top 5 percent (ventile) of sectors
is the largest contributor. This condition is realized in less than 4% of districts. A monotonic
increasing relationship between money and votes can hardly be reconciled with these figures. The
second panel of Table 4 repeats the same calculation considering the distribution of contributions
across districts for a given sector. We find that the largest employer in a sector is also the largest
contributor in generally less than 7% of sectors. This fraction increases when considering the case
of the top ventile of districts within each sector: the top 5 percent employment group is the top
contributor in 18% to 37% of the cases. In the majority of instances sectors do not pay the largest
contributions where their employment is the largest. We report the same type of evidence in Figure
1 where the employment size of the largest contributor is plotted against the employment size of
the largest employer within a district (Figure 1a, for 106th and 101st House) and within a sector
(Figure 1b). If contributions were increasing in employment size then all observations should lie
along the 45◦ line, but we observe that the large majority of the observations lie strictly above such
line. The graphs provide a snapshot of the size dispersion of the largest contributors as well.
As additional checks we report two important robustness extensions in Appendix Tables A1
and A2. Tables 2 and 3 do not allow for any role of electoral challengers. We consider this in
Table A1. Large incumbency advantages are a robust feature of US Congressional elections and
challengers usually garner relatively small amounts of resources for elections. Nonetheless, some
30

We perform an F-test with a null hypothesis of δ s,1 = 0 and δs,2 = 0 on the subset of sectors where we find

coeﬃcient point estimates that point to a hump.
31
All the data used in table 4 and the graphs are not winsorized in order to properly compute frequencies.

special interests contribute to challengers, either exclusively or jointly with incumbents/favorites.
Table A1 shows that considering the contributions to incumbents net of challengers’ contributions
does not change the frequency and robustness of the non-monotonicity that we report in the data
in any significant way. As a second check we consider the case where SIGs may not deliver all their
votes to only one candidate. To address this we split the SIG’s votes proportionally to the splitting
of the SIG’s contributions across the two diﬀerent candidates32 . Table A2 shows the robustness of
the results along this dimension. This specific way of controlling for SIG’s vote-splitting does not
change the frequency and robustness of the non-monotonicity.
By and large the reduced-form evidence tends to support the idea of a non-monotonic relationship between number of SIG’s voters and SIG’s contributions. This particular feature of the data is
novel to the best of our knowledge and surprisingly robust. In the next section we present a model
of the interaction between a legislator and several interest groups that rationalizes the results.

The model

This section presents a formal description of the game between politicians and SIGs. An initial
caveat is in order. The model is rigged toward empirical estimation and as such it is simplified
(radically) along several dimensions. Being critical of our own approach, we require cross-checking.
First, whenever restrictive assumptions are made, we show how the empirical results are aﬀected
by relaxing them. Second, we check our structural estimates against information external to the
model: parameter estimates should appear unreasonable if the model’s assumptions are excessively
restrictive.

3.1

Structure of the polity

Legislature and policy choice
Consider a jurisdiction where the population is divided into D equally sized electoral districts.
The parliament is formed by D legislators, each representing an electoral district d, d = 1, ..., D.
The task of the legislature is to pass or reject a set of policies. In order to simplify matters we
disregard the agenda-setting stage and consider the decision of each legislator d to vote in favor
or against each of the exogenously proposed policies. We do not model the interaction among the
legislators and the determination of the national policy since we are interested in the district-level
32

Given the absence of turnout and electoral data by SIGs, we are constrained by addressing the matter indirectly

in Table A2.

13

interaction between the incumbent legislator and the set of local interest groups, in view of future
electoral competition between the incumbent and a challenger.
Special interest groups
The economy is divided into S sectors producing goods or services. For the purpose of this
model a sector s in electoral district d is a group of capital owners and workers, which share a
common interest in policies that favor the sector.33 In each electoral district d the economy is
characterized by a diﬀerent size distribution of sectors. The size of interest group s in electoral
district d is represented by the number of workers/voters in the sector: vsd (the set of all voters who
have some stakes in policies that favor the sector). We indicate with the vector y = (y1 , y2 , ..., yS )
the set of policies proposed by the agenda setter. Policy ys might be an industry-specific subsidy
or tariﬀ, which increases the rent of interest group s. We assume that the benefit of the lobby
depends only on the aggregate income of the interest group. Ignoring for now the role played by
contributions, the income of the interest group depends on the benefit from policy ys . We allow the
benefit from ys to depend on the size of the interest group and the ability of the politician. Interest
group size matters because, for example, the benefit created by a subsidy given to an industry is
increasing in the size of the industry. By allowing the benefit to depend on the specific politician,
we want to capture the idea that more experienced legislators are more likely to be eﬀective at
supporting a piece of legislation and increase the size of the benefit to the interest group they agree
to support. For simplicity let us assume that in the absence of policy ys the rent of the interest
group is zero.34 The expected utility of interest group s, denoted by Usd is therefore:
Usd = γ d + ρd vsd + εsd
where ρd and γ d are the legislator-specific parameters and εsd is a random component that
might depend on the specific ability of a politician to support a particular sector.
We assume that agents with a stake in sector s act as a unified special interest group vis-á-vis
the district legislator.35 Since this paper focuses on the interaction between interest groups and
33

Although we recognize that the interests of workers and capital owners might not always coincide, we here focus

on policies for which they are suﬃciently aligned.
34
Members of the interest group might have other sources of income, which do not depend on the policy implemented. We disregard them here.
35
We will be interchangeably use the expression (special) interest group and lobby, even though the word lobbyist
would more strictly identify individuals that act on behalf of interest groups and do not necessarily decide on the
amount of political contributions. Lobbyists are more likely to channel information to the legislators while interest
groups decide independently to make campaign contributions (through their PAC’s, for example, in the United
States).

14

politicians, it seems plausible to abstract from coordination problems among individuals belonging
to an interest group. Since Olson (1965) contribution, a large literature has tried to identify
the characteristics that exacerbate the free-rider problem within groups that pursue a common
objective. We assume that when the group decides to vote for a given politician no individual
defects (defection is typically due to costly eﬀort or any other private cost of voting).
In this paper we concentrate on the interaction between a legislator and its constituents, that
is interest groups located in the electoral district. While we recognize that interest groups are able
to organize at the national level, it is common to observe that national associations promoting
special interests are divided into local chapters, which interact more closely with their respective
legislator.36 The importance of this local dimension of the interaction between interest groups and
politicians is testified by the predominance of in-state versus out-of-state political contributions for
the majority of politicians.37 Although the model can be extended to the simultaneous interaction
between legislators and lobbies at the national level, we choose not to pursue this avenue of research
here as it would greatly complicate the empirical estimation of the game by making the SIG’s payoﬀs
functions of the payoﬀs and the bargaining outcomes in all districts.38
36

It is also the case that many companies have their own PAC’s. So another interpretation is that companies

located in a district interact mainly with their legislator.
37
For the electoral cycle 1995-96 the median of the percentage of in-state contributions as a fraction of the total is
80% while the mean is 74%.
38
It is however interesting to address the question of how our results relate to previous research, particularly Stratmann (1992), focusing on a national lobby allocating resources across politicians. Stratmann considers a specific sector
and explores the relationship between the number of employees in diﬀerent districts and the amount of contributions
given to each legislator. This is similar to our within-sector analysis, which we can perform on 86 (or 84 depending
on the year) sectors (Stratmann only considers 1 sector, farming). Taking this standpoint, within-district results
should be the byproduct of the relationship between SIG’s and politicians at the national level. Five observations are
in order when comparing Stratmann’s results and ours. 1) As mentioned above, contributions are overwhelmingly a
local phenomenon. Out-of-state contributions are a small minority. 2) When comparing within-district and withinsector results in Table 3, within-district results seem to present stronger evidence of a non-monotonic relationship
than within-sector results. 3) Taking Stratmann’s model seriously, one should not observe positive contributions for
districts where a sector’s employment size is smaller than the median (given majority voting in Congress). This
would not strictly hold if there is uncertainty about politicians’ behavior, so Stratmann does expect to observe some
positive contributions even for observations below the median. However, the amount of contributions for observations
below the median is too large for such interpretation: about 40 percent of total sector’s contributions on average. 4)
We find that the peak of contributions is generally well above the median (above the 3rd quartile) and not around
the median. 5) Stratmann argues that for observations with employment levels above the median the relationship
between votes and contributions should be first decreasing (politicians that have aligned interests have to be paid less)
and then increasing (politicians with aligned interested are more productive and should be paid more). We do not
find generalized evidence of a spike in contributions for the highest levels of employment in nonparametric analysis

15

Voters
Like Baron (1994) and Grossman and Helpman (1996) we consider two types of voters, the
informed and the uninformed. Diﬀerently from these papers, the informed voters here are identified
by their occupation and general economic interests. In this paper the set of informed voters also
corresponds with the members of the interest groups, broadly defined as the set of individuals with
some stake in the sector. Therefore the number of informed voters in a district corresponds to
the sum of the individuals employed in each sector, vsd , in that district. The informed voters’
only concern is whether the proposed policy which benefits their sector, is supported by the elected
politician (and subsequently passed by the legislature). Interest groups can influence the incumbent
to vote in favor of their preferred policy not only by promising support of the informed voters in
the sector, but by also making political contributions which in turn can be used by the candidate
in the election campaign to aﬀect the decision of uninformed voters.
Uninformed voters are not influenced by the position of the candidates on the specific policy
vector y, but some of them can be aﬀected by the amount of advertising and other campaign expenditures undertaken by the candidates and directed to them. We define the set of uninformed
voters that responds to advertising as impressionable uninformed voters while the remaining uninformed voters are defined as non-impressionable uninformed voters. For simplicity we assume
that for each dollar spent on campaigning, the incumbent obtains the vote of αd impressionable
uninformed voters with certainty (alternatively, the ‘cost’ of an additional vote is

1
αd ).

Conversely

we assume that there is uncertainty over the behavior of non-impressionable uninformed voters: the
incumbent (and members of special interest groups) does not know how many of those uninformed
voters will turn up on election day and how many will vote for him or his challenger. The nature
of the uncertainty is described in the next subsection.
The incumbent legislator
The incumbent legislator in district d is concerned with winning the election (or re-election) so
her expected utility UdI depends on the return from being elected Ed , the probability of winning
¢
¡
the election, Pr WdI and some exogenous factor ξ d :
¡
¢
UdI = Ed Pr WdI + ξ d

Let us indicate by vI the number of NIU (non-impressionable uninformed) individuals who
vote for the incumbent, while vA is the number of NIU individuals who vote for the adversary
(the challenger). Knowledge of the incumbent legislator is limited to the ex-ante distribution
(not reported). These results suggest that, while Stratmann’s explanation for the farming sector contributions is still
valid, we need to explore other models in order to account for these diﬀerent features of the data.

16

of the diﬀerence between v A and v I . Uncertainty over the margin of victory of the challenger is
summarized by a cumulative density function which can diﬀer according to the characteristics of the
¡
¢
¡
¢
district Fd vdA − vdI . We assume for simplicity that the probability density function fd vdA − vdI
is continuous and diﬀerentiable. In the absence of contributions and voter support by interest
groups39 the incumbent wins the election whenever vdA − vdI ≤ 0

40 ,

so the probability of winning

for the incumbent is Fd (0).
Through bargaining with interest groups, the incumbent ensures a certain amount of contribuI the number of
tions and votes by interest group members (the informed voters). Indicate by vsd

informed voters in interest group s who vote for the incumbent and by Csd the contributions by
interest group s to the incumbent. The incumbent’s probability of winning is then:

The political game

We model the interaction between candidates and interest groups as a multiple bilateral bargaining
problem. Each political candidate engages in simultaneous bilateral bargaining with each of the
S special interest groups in her district. The structure of the game is therefore similar to the
one analyzed by Chipty and Snyder (1999) and Raskovich (2003). Both papers analyze a game
where one seller simultaneously negotiates with several buyers. This modeling approach oﬀers the
advantage of allowing us to find a unique solution in the level of contributions oﬀered by each lobby
provided we make some assumptions about the structure of uncertainty.41
We assume simultaneity in bargaining for two reasons. First, there is no obvious order in which
negotiations should take place since the each candidate could approach any interest group or vice
versa at any point in time. Second, as Raskovich (2003) argues, imposing an order of negotiations
implies that every interest group and candidate can observe whether negotiations of other players
have broken down. Since the negotiations between lobbyists and politicians can simply consist of a
phone call, it seems plausible that they could be resumed at any time and therefore any bargaining
39

For simplicity we assume that voters represented by interest groups would cast their vote randomly for the two

candidates in the absence of successful bargaining with the incumbent, so that on average their vote would not have
an impact on the electoral prospect of both candidates.
40
A tie is resolved in favor of the incumbent for simplicity
41
The politican economy literature has recently employed other modeling devices such as common agency (Grossman and Helpman (1994)). These models, under the assumption of quasi-linear preferences, lead to a unique equilibrium policy, but to a multiplicity of equilibrium contributions. Another interesting example of bilateral barganing
between lobbies and politicians is Drazen and Limâo (2007).

17

could not be considered terminated by other lobbies at any point in time.
As a result of the structure imposed, all the lobbies and the legislator can contract upon is the
favorable vote by the legislator, not the final outcome of the legislature vote, since the politician
can only decide on his own vote. Let us indicate the action of legislator d to support policy ys
by ads : if the politician supports the policy then asd = 1 and asd = 0 otherwise. For simplicity
supporting each policy ys entails no cost for the politician4243 .
The game is played in two stages:
1. In the first stage the incumbent legislator d enters into simultaneous negotiations with each
lobby s separately. Bargaining between the incumbent and each lobby s determines the
I ≤ v , the amount of contributions C
amount of votes promised vsd
sd
sd and the position of the

candidate, asd . We assume that the order in which negotiations are made and whether they
succeed or not is not observable by other lobbies until the second stage.
2. In the second stage the legislature votes on the set of proposed policies y, the contributions
obtained by each candidate are spent in an electoral campaign to sway the IU voters and the
election takes place.
We assume that the outcome of the negotiations between lobby s and the incumbent is given
by the Nash bargaining solution, taking as given the behavior of other lobbies j 6= s in the district.

42

Introducing a cost of supporting policies would entail no diﬀerence in the results of this analysis, unless two

specific cases are introduced. First, if the marginal cost of supporting a policy increases with the number of “favors”
then a politician will not decide to support every policy. Second, in the case the total amount of resources (e.g. eﬀort)
a politician can devote to supporting policies is limited, the legislator will again decide not to support every piece
of legislation. Both cases would introduce competition among lobbies. Since it is not immediate to us the extent
to which these eﬀects would interact with the mechanisms we intend to illustrate in this paper, we abstract from
competition among lobbies.
43
The main reason for excluding competition between special interests is data-driven. We tested extensively for
competition eﬀects by looking at obvious competititors such as upstream and downstream producers employing inputoutput tables. We could not find any empirical regularity of sort. We believe that, although competition between
special interests is relevant for specific bills and earmarks, it is unlikely to have such a systematic component across
all districts and special interests (so various ranging from tobacco to steel to hospitals) to be picked up precisely in
our empirical design.

focus on the first-order theoretical mechanism.

Marginal Impact Eﬀect

This assumption is needed to guarantee the concavity of the maximization problem, but for the main result to

hold we just need fd (·) to be decreasing over its positive support.

19

Everything else equal, the size of lobby s aﬀects the amount of its contributions through three
eﬀects:
1. Surplus Eﬀect: a larger vsd means that the interest group benefits more from legislation ys .
This eﬀect tends to increase contributions as the increased surplus is shared between the
legislator and the interest group. This eﬀect is constant because of the linearity assumption
in the benefit function.
2. Substitution Eﬀect: as an interest group promises more votes, the amount of contributions
needed to transfer a given surplus share to the legislator declines. This eﬀect declines with vsd
due to the assumption of a decreasing fd (·): an increase in vsd yields progressively a smaller
increase in the probability of winning. Therefore, this eﬀect causes contributions to decline
with vsd , but at a declining rate.
3. Marginal Impact Eﬀect: as the number of votes promised increases, the marginal value of
contributions declines because of the assumption of a decreasing fd (·). If an interest group
promises a large number of votes, then it resolves most of the uncertainty. Extremely favorable events are less and less likely to happen. Therefore the marginal impact of a dollar
of contributions is evaluated at a point where fd (·) is low. Due to this eﬀect contributions
decrease with the size of the lobby45 . The strength of this eﬀect hinges on the degree at which
fd (·) declines.
The eﬀects described above are implied by a comparative statics exercise that takes V−sd as
given. Therefore the discussion has ignored the impact that size has on contributions through
the optimal response of other lobbies. This is because under a general distribution function it is
diﬃcult to determine the direction of such eﬀects.46 The non-monotonicity of the FOC (4) creates
∗ , ..., C ∗ ), which makes it

impossible to investigate the behavior of contributions unless we make further assumptions about
the density function of the challenger margin. To close the model parametrically we consider
the case in which the margin vdA − vdI follows an exponential distribution. The assumption of an
exponential distribution for the challenger margin greatly simplifies the analysis, as the optimal

The eﬀect can be interpreted as a microfoundation for the reduced-form assumption of decreasing returns to

political contributions. See Drazen and Limâo (2007).

amount of contributions is independent of the choice by other lobbies47 . This is crucial in order
to deliver uniqueness of the equilibrium contributions, without which it would not be possible to
proceed to structural analysis.

We will verify later that estimates of ρd and αd confirm that the assumption is satisfied in the

The exponential distribution presents some properties that are desirable in the context of our
model. First, the pdf is always decreasing48 , as required in order to obtain a concave maximization
problem. Second, it is decreasing at a rate such that the combination of the Marginal Benefit
47

The intuition behind this assumption relies on the property of negative exponentials that "the future is indepen-

dent of the past" (i.e. they are memoryless). Notice that this assumption is similar in spirit to the assumption of
no economic interaction among lobbies made in several papers in the political bargaining literature, see Drazen and
Limâo (2007).
48
This property also implies that, if the location parameter λ is negative, then for the incumbent victory by a
larger margin is more likely than victory by a smaller margin, up to margin vdI − vdA = λ, but larger margins have
zero probability. We recognize this might not be a fully realistic representation of the ex-ante form of uncertainty.

Eﬀect and the Substitution Eﬀect dominate over the Surplus eﬀect for large values of vsd , which is
consistent with the empirical regularity found in the data in Section 2. Third, the exponential is
parametrically parsimonious, in that it is identified by just two parameters. This is an important
technical condition that we need to keep in mind when bringing the model to the data.

Proof. See Appendix
The intuition for this result relies on the fact that when elections are more uncertain the marginal
benefit of contributions does not decline as rapidly so the surplus eﬀect dominates for a larger range
of values of vsd , which makes the ‘hump’ shift to the right. In this section we have presented a
model of the interaction between a legislator and several lobbies that, under some assumptions,
delivers the observed inverted-U relationship between votes and contributions49 .
In Section 4 we estimate the structural parameters of the model: the electoral impact of a
dollar, αd , the uncertainty of the race, β d and the eﬀectiveness of the politician ρd .
49

Although this framework provides a possible explanation for the observed hump-shaped pattern, an alternative

explanation could be developed along the following lines. Imagine that, as in Grossman and Helpman (1994), politician
d cares about contributions, but also about the welfare of its constituents (in this case all voters in district d). The
proposed policy ys causes an overall distortion in welfare, but also benefits the group of voters vsd . In this case
contributions might increase with the size of the group for the same reason as in our model (the politician obtains a
fraction of a larger surplus), but might decrease because the welfare loss caused by a given policy ys in the district
decreases with the size of the group vsd . For simplicity, let the welfare loss at the national level be constant. Then

In order to implement ML we impose the distributional assumption that εsd be i.i.d. within district

a district with a larger fraction of voters in sector s experiences a relatively lower welfare loss and therefore the
politician d might ask for a lower level of contributions to partially compensate for the welfare loss. In order for these
forces to yield an hump-shaped pattern of contributions, this second eﬀect must get stronger as the voter groups
size vsd increases, i.e. the benefit from policy ys must be increasing more than linearly with group size vsd . It is
not obvious on which grounds to justify such a functional form assumption and our explanation, which relies on
a decreasing probability of larger defeat margins (i.e. a declining f (·)) might be easier to rationalize. To se why,
consider that a functional form assumption on diminishing welfare losses would be required to operate similarly for
sectors completely diﬀerent in terms of technology or market characteristics.
We discuss and test in Appendix B a series competing hypothesis.
Notice that ML approach allows to incorporate this feature of the data in a natural way. In the reduced-form

50

analysis of the previous section we have opted for OLS as a simpler (and rougher) approximation.

where we employ the indicator function Zsd = I [Csd = 0] and denote by θd the vector of parameters
of interest to be estimated for each district d:
θd = (αd , β d , γ d , ρd , σ d ) .
The argument of the logarithm in the first element of (9) is the Jacobian of the transformation51 .
Finally, in the estimation procedure we will impose certain inequality constraints requested by the
model (αd > 0, β d > 0, σ d > 0).
In the next sections we first report the quantitative results obtained from estimating the bargaining model. We then provide an interpretation of the structural parameters and we compare
them to previous politico-economic studies.

4.1

Results

This section presents the ML estimates of θd district by district, in a fashion similar to the analysis
in (1). Given the reassuring consistency of the reduced-form analysis across Congressional branches
and years, in the structural analysis we will focus on the set of incumbents of the 106th House,
specifically those running for reelection in November 2000.
From a computational standpoint, the main issues in maximizing (9) involve the ratios of the
αd and β d parameters, the highly nonlinear (exponential) components in the Jacobian, and the
numerical computation of the integral in the last line of (9). The likelihood function turns out
to be relatively well behaved after opportune reparameterization. We confirm this through modelspecific Monte-Carlo simulations. Specifically, when performing simulations of the data from known
distributions and parameters, the maximum likelihood estimator of the model performs well in
delivering back the original parameters, even in samples of size 100 (the eﬀective per-district sample
sizes are 86 and 84 for 2000 and 1990 respectively). However, according to the Monte-Carlo evidence
the parameters αd and, especially, β d exhibit a certain degree of sensitivity to miss-specifications
in the underlying distribution52 . Finally, in the following analysis the maximization proceeds from
a set of initial values that is randomly sampled 1, 200 times, reassuring on the presence of a unique
maximum.
Table 5 presents the distribution of the maximum likelihood parameters by Congressional district race. Since the nonlinear model is unit-dependent, we perform the analysis employing contributions in dollars for Csd and number of employees, vsd , adjusted for average voter turnout of

voting age population in the 2000 electoral cycle, 51.3% (FEC)53 . For the sake of exposition and for
consistency with much of the literature we report the inverse of the parameter αd , whose natural
interpretation is the amount of money necessary to buy one vote. This approach has the additional
implication of allowing us to employ $1 as the unit of analysis for all parameters with the exception
of β d (expressed in number of votes). A relatively coarse54 grid-search has to be applied to the
transformed parameter 1/αd . For completeness we also include in the bottom part of Table 5 the
distribution of the maximum likelihood parameters by Congressional district race including the
districts where we obtain a maximum on the bounds of the grid of 1/αd (i.e. at $0 and $1, 000).
These figures are less informative within the framework of our model, since it is problematic to
interpret the results on the bounds (at $0 the value of αd is not finite and at $1, 000 the maximum
of the likelihood function might not have been achieved). The upper part of Table 5 excludes these
districts.
Overall both the SIG’s and the politician’s parameters are precisely estimated when looking
at the frequency of the z-test rejections at 0.05 confidence level (computed with robust standard
errors) across races. Only the parameter γ d is statistically zero in less than 1/3 of the districts,
indicating that policy benefits seem to be related to SIG’s size without any constant benefit. The
SIG’s policy benefit per worker ρd is on average $347.9, and its median is $113.2. Notice however
the substantial variation in the estimates of the per-worker benefit. The standard deviation across
Congressional races is $342.66. We observe higher figures for ρd when focusing on the districts where
the maximum likelihood estimates are not necessarily interior to the bounds of the grid for 1/αd .
Particularly, the mean benefit per worker increases to around $547.9 and the median to $703.8. The
standard deviation of the distribution of the idiosyncratic random component εsd , representing the
specific ability of a politician to support a particular sector, is precisely estimated. The mean value
of σ d is $22, 223.6 with a standard deviation across all districts of $11, 799.9. Including districts on
the bounds of 1/αd does not substantially aﬀect the moments of the estimates of σ d .
Focusing on the politician’s parameters, the estimated monetary value of a vote, 1/αd , is on
average $339.33 with a median55 of $100. Similarly to the case of ρd , the variation across district is
substantial, with a standard deviation of $341. When focusing on the districts where the maximum
is not necessarily interior to the bounds of 1/αd (where the model does not perform accurately) we
53

Given the nonlinearity of the model, the use of the appropriate unit for votes and contributions is necessary in

order to obtain consistent estimates of the marginal eﬀect of contributions. In the linear regression models of the
reduced-form section the estimates of the peak are independent of the unit.
54
The grid search ranges on 1/αd ∈ {0, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000}.

find both higher mean and median ($536.8 and $700 respectively). Notice that 67 percent of the
sample falls within the bounds and only 8 observations out of 401 actually reach a maximum of
the likelihood at 1/αd = 0.
The scale parameter of the ex ante distribution of adversary versus favorable voters to the
incumbent, β d , is significantly estimated in more than half the districts/races. The location parameter of the distribution, λd , is not identified in the model and not estimated. The mean number
of votes of the scale parameter is 334, 503.4, and 369, 048.3 when we include districts with estimates
on the boundary of the grid of 1/αd . More interestingly, the median number of votes of the scale
parameter is 121, 918.2, and 250, 189.0 when we include districts with estimates on the boundary of
the grid of 1/αd . To interpret the estimates recall that the mean and median of the distribution are
not identified without λd , but that the scale of an exponential distribution is its standard deviation
and, more informatively for an asymmetric distribution, approximates the size of the interquartile
range (i.e.β d ' β d (ln 4 − ln 4/3)). Therefore we can attribute to β d ’s estimates the interpretation
of ex ante electoral uncertainty. It is interesting to notice that the results obtained from estimating
ex ante electoral uncertainty from the money-votes curve compare in magnitude to the ex post
electoral margins observed in the data. In the 2000 electoral cycle the average vote margin was
87, 168 votes, with an aggregate standard deviation of 45, 996 votes. These figures confirm that β d ’s
fall within a reasonable quantitative range, albeit with the caveat of aggregating ex post electoral
uncertainty across Congressional races. Along this line of reasoning in the next section we go in
further depth in analyzing the predictive power of the model by comparing its estimates to data
not explicitly included in the empirical design. We will interpret such results as a validation of the
predictive capacity of the model.

4.2

Validation of the estimates employing information external to the model

The simplicity of the empirical approach that we follow (essentially based on SIG’s voters and
contributions only) should not sacrifice excessively to realism of prediction. In this section we
present validation exercises for the estimated parameters of the model. We confront the districtlevel estimates of the parameters with out-of-sample information regarding the ex post tightness of
the electoral races and the specific characteristics of the constituency.
Table 6 reports the results of regressing the district/politician-specific parameters on a set of
covariates. In columns (1) and (2) the vector of parameters 1/αd , proxying for the estimated cost
of swaying an additional voter, is regressed on the ex post vote margin56 of the electoral race (in
56

The ex post vote margin is defined as the diﬀerence between the votes accrued to the elected candidate minus

26

the first column) and on the population density (number of inhabitants per land square mile) in the
second column. In principle we would expect races that are ex ante electorally more uncertain to be
also more expensive. It is however challenging to measure ex ante electoral uncertainty. Poll surveys,
for instance, are extremely volatile and change radically (and endogenously to contributions) over
time. We therefore inversely approximate ex ante uncertainty with the ex post vote margins. On
a diﬀerent token, we would expect that more densely populated areas where media markets charge
higher advertisement fees to be also associated with higher 1/αd . In columns (3) the vector of
parameters β d (proxying for ex ante dispersion of electoral margins) is regressed on the ex post
vote margin of the electoral race. Estimated ex ante uncertain races should be negatively associated
with ex post vote margins. We verify that these three hypotheses seem confirmed by the data (in
sign and statistical significance for 1/αd and sign only for β d ).
A check on the comparative statics of the model is reported in column (4). Proposition 6
predicts a positive correlation between the size of the SIG with largest contributions and the degree
of uncertainty of the race. The intuition is that more uncertain races should present a peak at a
larger lobby size since the marginal impact of a dollar of contributions is relatively more valuable
in tighter races. This is clearly embedded in the estimated parameters (higher β d ’s imply larger
v̂sd ). The data on ex post vote margins confirm this result as well. In column (4) we regress the
reduced-form estimates of v̂sd on the size of the vote margin and we find the expected negative sign
(statistically significant at 5 percent confidence level). This further supports the interpretation of
column (3) on electoral uncertainty.
Considering that information about the specific electoral outcomes or geographic characteristics
of the constituency is not directly incorporated in our estimation, we find these results reassuring.

4.3

Previous estimates of the cost of an additional vote

Our estimates of 1/α can be compared to the results of previous studies on the impact of campaign
spending on electoral outcomes. In particular these studies have obtained estimates of campaign
spending by the incumbent and the main challenger on the realized vote shares. Levitt (1994)
presents estimates of the eﬀect of a $100, 000 (in 1990 dollars) increase in spending on the vote
share. The general conclusion of that study is that campaign spending has no statistically significant
eﬀect on the election outcome, when one controls for unobserved candidate quality and district
characteristics. At most those eﬀects are very small, implying that votes are very costly to obtain
those accrued to the second, divided by the sum of the two numbers. This measure is inversely proportional to the
tightness of the race.

27

though campaign spending. The estimates vary according to the specification, but we consider the
numbers reported in column (1) of Table 5 of Levitt (1994) as an example.57 Levitt finds that
an increase of $100, 000 gives the challenger 0.3% more of the vote, while it gives the incumbent
only roughly an extra 0.1% of the vote. In 2000 the number of U.S. citizens who had the right
to vote was about 186 millions, of whom 59.5% voted.58 A typical district would have therefore
about 427, 600 eligible voters, of whom only 256, 500 vote on average. This means that $100, 000
would buy about 770 extra votes using the challenger estimate, which amounts to a price of about
$130 per vote. The price would be $390 per vote using the incumbent estimate for the spending
coeﬃcient. These numbers are compatible with the estimates that we report for the 1/αd in our
model. The implied cost of a vote is on average $339.3 with a median of $100 according to our
estimates.
Levitt (1994) also reports estimates by Jacobson (1980) and Green and Krasno (1988) of the
same eﬀect but employing diﬀerent empirical designs. In these studies the eﬀects are larger59 : the
2SLS estimates of Green and Krasno (1988)60 imply an eﬀect of 2.4% (for the challenger) and 2.2%
(for the incumbent), which imply a cost of $16.25 and $18 per vote.
It is worth emphasizing that the estimate of 1/αd that we obtain reflects the ex-ante evaluation
by a politician of the cost of buying an extra certain vote. In the studies mentioned above, the
estimates refer to the ex-post realization of the eﬀect of votes on contributions. With this distinction
in mind, our estimates are more in line with the cost implied by Levitt (1994) results.

4.4

Estimating returns to political contributions: Tullock’s puzzle

In this section we present a calibration of the model’s results aiming at quantitatively addressing
what in the political economy literature is commonly referred to as the Tullock’s puzzle61 . Simply
stated, the puzzle is that the amount of political contributions is too low relative to the substantial
amount of public resources that special interests seem able to obtain through bargaining with politi57

The individual coeﬃcients in this column are not individually statistically significant, but we use the estimate to

illustrate the order of magnitude.
58
See Jamieson et al. (2002). This is the ratio between the number of voters and the the number of citizens who
have the right to vote aged 18 and over. Notice that this is diﬀerent from the ratio between the number of voters and
the number of individuals in the country aged 18 and over (51.3%) due to the presence of foreigners and individuals
who cannot vote. We use the latter percentage when assessing the percentage of voting workers in each sector.
59
See Table 3 in Levitt (1994).
60
These are the estimates that most closely compare to Levitt (1994) as they include an index of quality of the
challenger.

In Tullock (1972). See Ansolabehere, et al. (2003) for a detailed overview of the topic.

28

cians. This implies absurdly high rates of return from political investments that seem unjustifiable
in any other competitive market. Alternatively the puzzle can be restated as the politicians being
unreasonably cheap.
A natural interpretation of our model is that politicians and special interest groups exchange
more than political contributions, they also bargain over votes. The “missing money” may be due
to the omission from the rate of return calculation of the votes that the lobby supplies the politician
at the moment of the election. In order to (roughly) gauge quantitatively the magnitude of such an
omission consider the following example (one of the most striking they present) from Ansolabehere,
de Figueiredo, Snyder (2003, p. 111). In 2000 total USDA subsidies to agriculture amounted
to $22.1 billion62 vis-a-vis total political contributions in the amount of $3.3 million. Taken at
face value these two numbers imply an astronomical rate of return. About $6, 665 for every $1 of
political contributions. However, this computation disregards the value of the about 2 million U.S.
working-age voting farmers and the implied value of one of their votes ($400). Consider now the
rate of return that correcting for this additional component would imply. The rate of return adjusts
to a still very high, but more reasonable figure, about $26 for every $1 of political contributions
($12 for an average year)63 . This correction produces a reduction of the estimate of more than
2 orders of magnitude, indicating that accounting for the substitution between contributions and
votes may substantially help in reducing the apparent paradox behind Tullock’s puzzle.
The structural estimates of the model can also help shedding light on the quantitative relevance of the votes/money interaction and their eﬀect on the estimates of the return to “political
investment”. In Table 7 we report the estimated average rates of return for political contributions
across SIGs (106th House) computed in two diﬀerent ways. The first line of the table computes the
district-SIG specific rate of return as the ratio of monetary benefit from the policy and political
contributions, that is
RRsd =

γ d + ρd vsd
− 1.
Csd

(10)

The average rate of return across all districts and lobbies is $431 for every $1 of political contributions with a large standard deviation across districts of $1542. The mean value is surprisingly
close to estimates obtained using actual subsidy data. We can now compare the average RR to the
62

This amount is the highest figure of the all 1995-2004 decade of subsidies paid by the USDA. The average yearly

figure ranges around $11 billion.
63
Notice that although votes do not ‘cost’ anything to farming interest groups, it is nevertheless necessary to include
them in the calculations to find the correct marginal return to contributions, that is the return the next dollar of
contributions would earn the interest group.

29

measure implied by the model:

RRsd

γ d + ρd vsd

Csd + αd vsd

(11)

The results employing (11) appear on the second and third rows of Table 7. The model-implied
average rate of return RR0 across all districts and all lobbies is a reasonable $0.33 for every $1
of political contributions64 ($0.12 employing the same sample as row 1). The standard deviation
across districts reads around $12, a larger figure which may well encompass cases like the agricultural
example we have just presented.
Table 8 reports all the moments of the lobby-specific estimated rates of return. Part (a) of the
table reports the statistics computed with the definition in (10), while part (b) of Table 8 employs
the definition in (11) for estimating returns. As expected, part (b) reports values of the rates of
return that are quantitatively reasonable.
In synthesis we believe the inclusion of the electoral dimension to the bargaining problem over
political contributions sheds substantial light on the rationale behind the observed figures. The
level of political contributions in the data does not appear unreasonably low once the role of SIG’s
votes is also taken into account.

Conclusion

This paper models and empirically tests a series of predictions concerning the bargaining of politicians and local special interest groups. We uncover a novel pattern in the data concerning the
relationship between votes and money in US congressional politics that follows an inverted-U relationship. A simultaneous bilateral bargaining game with heterogenous special interest groups
rationalizes the data appropriately65 , emphasizing the pattern of substitution between votes and
money that emerges when lobbies tend to be large in terms of workers/voters. The estimates also
provide a valid alternative to present studies of the amount of money necessary to sway one voter
and of the rates of return of political contributions.
An avenue of future research is to explore how the approach developed in this paper may be
extended to formal treatment of the coordination of local and national special interests. While the
pattern of contribution operates mostly at the level of local interactions, national coordination of
64

We restrict our attention to the sample with positive political benefit, as required by the model. About 5 percent

of the observations violate this constraint. However including such observations would have the eﬀect of reducing the
rate of return of political contributions even more, not increasing it.
65
In Appendix B we explore alternative hypotheses that might be consistent with the pattern observed and show
evidence that points toward an interpretation of the results that is closer to our model.

30

SIG’s is essential. Relatively few studies in political science and in political economy have tried to
address this issue systematically, mostly focusing on the SIG as a national entity.
This paper contributes to the literature concerned with modeling the interaction between economic and political interests from a rational choice perspective66 . Relative to standard reduced-form
approaches in the literature the more structured approach followed in the paper allows to simultaneously gauge the role of electoral uncertainty and politicians eﬀectiveness as perceived by the
interest groups.
66

The paper therefore is also related to a well established literature on how economic interests influence political

policy-making. See Peltzman (1984, 1985).

Appendix A

To simplify expressions we are going to drop the subscript d in the following proofs.
Proof of Proposition 4
Substituting the expression for the probability density function and the cumulative density
function in (4) and setting, WLOG, γ = 0 and εs = 0, delivers the following FOC:

We can rewrite this equation as g (Cs ) = 0. Function g (·) is continuous and diﬀerentiable on R.
Since limCs →−∞ = −∞ and limCs →∞ = ∞ then by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists
a real number Cs∗ , such that g (Cs∗ ) = 0

In order to prove uniqueness let us assume that the root of g (·) is not unique, i.e. there are two
¡ ¢

roots Cs1 and Cs2 , Cs1 < Cs2 such that g Cs1 = g Cs2 = 0. Then by the Mean Value Theorem,
there must be a real number C 0 such that:

However g 0 (·) = 1 + exp αCsβ+vs > 0 so, by contradiction there must be only one real number

that solves g (Cs ) = 0. If such solution is negative then contributions are set to be equal to zero.

It must be the case that contributions are not larger than total income of the lobby. In Figure

Inequality (14) is satisfied for εs > −γ, a condition that we assume holds (this means εs is not
“too” negative). Since we have established that under certain conditions at vs = 0 contributions
are strictly smaller than income, we only need to show that the contribution function increases at
a lower rate than income to complete the proof that the contribution function is in between the
two parallel lines in Figure A1 when it is increasing. This amounts to showing that
is satisfied since:

Proof of Proposition 6

From the proof of Proposition 4 we know that the point (vsmax , Csmax ) is located at the intersection of the function describing the FOC in (5) and (13). By solving the system of two equations
in two unknowns, we find a unique solution as in (7) and (8). To prove (ii) we calculate the first
derivative:

ln αρ + αρ − 1
dvsmax
=
dβ
1 + αρ

which is positive by Assumption 3. We do the same for contributions:

Csd
=

1 − αρ + αρ ln αρ
α (1 + αρ)

which is positive if and only if ln αρ > 1.

Appendix B: Alternative Hypotheses

The analysis so far has only briefly considered alternative explanations that might be consistent
with the pattern that we uncover in the data. Here we decide to discuss two interesting hypotheses
that could potentially explain the hump-shaped relationship between votes and contributions. We
find evidence that points against these explanations and leaves the hypothesis proposed in this
paper as the more convincing alternative.
36

A first hypothesis, which we refer to as “free-riding”, finds an explanation for the declining
section of the relationship in the following observation, by Mancur Olson (1965) about larger
groups: “Though all of the members of the group therefore have a common interest in obtaining
this collective benefit, they have no common interest in paying the cost of providing that collective
good.” Free riding would imply that as the size of the group increases, the incentive to contribute
declines. Although we cannot formally test our model against this alternative we attempt to address
this issue in two ways.
First, we employ data on number of establishments per sector in a district to control for the
extent of free-riding. If the Olsonian view were correct, then for a given number of employees in
a sector, we should observe that the smaller the number of firms (approximated by the number of
establishments), the larger each firm and the larger the incentive to contribute towards the common
favorable policy. So we should observe a negative relationship between the amount of contributions
and the number of firms/establishments, given the size of the sector (i.e. size of the labor force).
Denote number of establishments in sector s in district d by esd . The district-level regression results
reported in Table A3 refer to the following specification:
2
+ ξ d esd + µsd
Csd = κd + δ d,1 vsd + δ d,2 vsd

We find that in many districts, contrary to the free-riding hypothesis, for a given sector size,
the amount of political contributions rises the more dispersed the sector is, that is the larger the
number of establishments. In 403 districts out of 435 the coeﬃcient ξ d on establishment number is
positive and in 105 also significant, pointing to the fact that this data does not seem to indicate the
presence of free-riding and that, even controlling for this dimension, the district-level hump shape,
documented in Table 3 remains unchanged.
The second piece of evidence suggesting that free-riding cannot explain certain features of the
data is found in Table 5 where we show that the hump moves to the right when election margins
are closer (i.e. less predictable). There is no unambiguous reason for why free-riding should
decrease when elections are more uncertain. This is in contrast with our intuitive interpretation
that contributions become more important in uncertain elections because their marginal impact
is higher. Although we cannot nest formally the collective action problem within our model, we
believe these two pieces of evidence point against an Olsonian interpretation of the pattern found
in this paper.
A second hypothesis that we consider is summarized by the following simple example. Imagine
a politician cares equally about votes and contributions and bears a cost m when supporting a
policy favorable to interest group s (it might be because of the welfare loss or private eﬀort in
37

arguing in favor of a piece of legislation). Also assume that the interest group s benefits vs from
such legislation and makes a take-or-leave oﬀer in terms of contributions and electoral support (vs )
to the politician to solicit support of the policy. Such simple game yields the simple prediction that
contributions by sector s:
Cs =

⎧
⎨

0 if vs ≤ m
⎩ m − vs if vs > m

This simple example would imply that contributions are negligible up to a certain size of the
interest group, they then increase discretely and then decline. Such pattern is not confirmed in the
data where we notice that the relationship between votes and contributions is characterized by a
significant increasing section and about 1 dollar out of 3 of political contributions within a district
are paid by the SIG’s below the median. This seems to suggest that the hypothesis is not suﬃcient
to explain the hump-shaped pattern.

Note: The 106th Congress refers to the electoral cycle of year 2000, 101th to 1990. Fraction employed is the total number of
workers employed in a SIG divided by congressional district's (State's for the Senate) population. Total number of observations
for 106th House is 37410 (no. House seats 435 * no. SIG 86). Total number of observations for 106th Senate is 8600 (no.
Senate seats 100 * no. SIG 86). Total number of observations for 101st House is 36540 (no. seats 435 * no. SIG 84). Total
number of observations for 101st Senate is 8400 (no. seats 100 * no. SIG 84). Standard errors clustered at the electoral district
level (congressional district for House and State for Senate). All regressions include a constant, not reported.

Note: The 106th Congress refers to the electoral cycle of year 2000, 101th to 1990. Fraction employed is the total number of
workers employed in a SIG divided by congressional district's (State's for the Senate) population. Total number of observations
for 106th House is 37410 (no. House seats 435 * no. SIG 86). Total number of observations for 106th Senate is 8600 (no.
Senate seats 100 * no. SIG 86). Total number of observations for 101st House is 36540 (no. seats 435 * no. SIG 84). Total
number of observations for 101st Senate is 8400 (no. seats 100 * no. SIG 84). Standard errors clustered at the electoral district
level (congressional district for House and State for Senate). All regressions include a constant, not reported.

percent of employers in the district are considered. The largest 5 percent of employers' total amounts are averaged and
compared with the mean total contributions at all 5-centiles. In each district there are either 86 (106th Congress) or 84
industries (101st). The within-industry analysis is performed in each of the 86 (for 106th Congress) and 84 (for 101st Congress)
industries. The largest and the largest 5 percent of employers in the industry are considered. For each industry we consider 435
congressional districts or 100 Senate seats.
