Global Forces and Monetary Policy Effectiveness

ABSTRACT
In this paper, we quantify the changes in the relationship between international forces and many key
US macroeconomic variables over the 1984-2005 period, and analyze changes in the monetary policy
transmission mechanism. We do so by estimating a Factor-Augmented VAR on a large set of US and
international data series. We find that the role of international factors in explaining US variables has
been changing over the 1984-2005 period. However, while some US series have become more correlated
with global factors, there is little evidence suggesting that these factors have become systematically
more important. We don't find strong evidence of a change in the transmission mechanism of monetary
policy due to global forces. Taking our point estimates literally, global forces do not seem to have
played an important role in the US monetary transmission mechanism between 1984 and 1999. In
addition, since the year 2000, the initial response of the US economy following a monetary policy
shock --- the first 6 to 8 quarters --- is essentially the same as the one that has been observed in the
1984-1999 period. However, point estimates suggest that the growing importance of global forces
might have contributed to reducing some of the persistence in the responses, two or more years after
the shocks. Overall, we conclude that if global forces have had an effect on the monetary transmission
mechanism, this is a recent phenomenon.

Introduction

In many respects, the economic integration of the U.S. economy with the rest of the world has
deepened in the last two decades. International trade has continued to expand more rapidly than
economic activity in industrialized countries. For the US, the amount of goods and services imported
and exported which represented 18% of GDP in the mid-1980’s represents more than 27% in 2005.
But the globalization of finance has shown a much more dramatic development. During the same
period, the ratio of foreign assets and liabilities to GDP has increased from approximately 80%
to more than 300% in the 23 most industrialized economies, according to Lane and Milesi-Ferretti
(2006). As global economic integration is spreading, it is often argued that macroeconomic variables
in one country – whether they pertain to measures of economic activity, inflation, or interest rates
– should increasingly reflect events occurring in the rest of the world.1
Such developments raise naturally two sets of questions which we attempt to address in this
paper. First, to what extent have international factors aﬀected the determination of key macroeconomic variables in the US economy? Is it the case that with the recent globalization, this economy
has become more strongly aﬀected by international factors? Second, has the very rapid globalization of finance weakened the ability of US monetary policy to influence domestic financial market
conditions, and through it, the rest of the economy? In other words, does a change in the Federal
Funds rate have a smaller impact on the US economy now than it used to?
Central bankers and economists in the financial press have pointed out the fact that while the
US central bank raised the Federal funds rate target by 425 basis points between June 2004 and
July 2006, long-term rates remained at historically low levels with the ten-year Treasury bond yield
increasing by less than 40 basis points and the twenty-year yield actually falling by 20 basis points
during that time. This phenomenon, which former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
labeled “conundrum” highlights the fact that US long-term interest rates may have become more
dependent on international factors than had been observed historically. As then Governor Bernanke
1
For example, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Richard Fisher, and Michael Cox (2007) have
argued that domestic inflation may be increasingly determined in the rest of the world. Advocating a “new inflation
equation,” they conclude that “globalization has been changing how we consume as well as the way we do business.
It’s high time economic doctrine caught up.” The Economist (2005), citing Stephen Roach, chief economist of Morgan
Stanley, and the 2005 annual report of the Bank for International Settlements suggests that global forces have become
more important relative to domestic factors in determining inflation in individual countries.

1

(2005) explained, a more extensive global financial integration and the increased amount of savings
outside the US – in particular in developing economies – may have resulted in a “global saving
glut” which may have put downward pressures on long-term interest rates. A casual look at such
recent historical episodes raises the possibility that the long-term yields may respond less to changes
in Federal funds rates than in the past. Given that monetary policy does at least in part aﬀect
the economy through its eﬀect on long-term rates, it is natural to wonder about the implications
of the globalization of finance for the eﬀectiveness of monetary policy. Certainly, the answers to
such questions have key implications for a proper understanding of the determinants of economic
fluctuations, and for policy.
To address these questions, we provide in this paper an empirical assessment of the synchronization between international factors and key US economic variables. We then investigate whether
the importance of these global forces has changed for the US economy over the last two decades,
and how such a possible change has aﬀected the transmission of monetary policy.
The general empirical framework that we consider is a factor-augmented vector autoregression
model (FAVAR), as described in Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz (2005), but extended to explicitly
include international or “global” factors. One of its key features is to provide estimates of macroeconomic factors that aﬀect the data of interest by systematically exploiting all information from
a large set of economic indicators. In our application, we estimate the empirical model based on
the information from a large number of macroeconomic indicators, and disaggregated data for the
US, as well as a large set of macroeconomic indicators for the 15 major US trade partners. By
identifying US monetary policy shocks, this framework allows us to uncover the transmission of
such shocks to a large set of macroeconomic indicators. Our interest in studying the responses
to monetary policy shocks does not reside in the fact that these shocks are important. In fact,
it is well-known that they contribute only little to US output fluctuations. Rather, we find the
responses to such shocks interesting as they allow us to trace out the eﬀects of monetary policy on
the economy.
Many studies have provided evidence that key macroeconomic variables display substantial
comovements across countries. For instance, Kose, Otrok and Whiteman (2003), analyzing output,
consumption and investment data from 60 countries over the 1960-1990 period, document that a
2

large fraction of business cycles fluctuations of developed economies is accounted by a common
world factor. The latter factor – a component of economic activity which is common to all
countries considered – explains more than one third of output fluctuations in the US and in
Europe.2 Ciccarelli and Mojon (2005) argue that inflation in industrialized economies is also largely
a global phenomenon: they find that on average, about 70% of inflation variance is attributable
to a common global factor given by the component of inflation that is common across countries.
Moreover, Ehrmann, Fratzscher, and Rigobon (2005) show that shocks to money, bond and equity
markets result in substantial spillovers between the US and Europe.
Other researchers have recently examined whether the importance of such comovements across
regions has changed over time. The evidence regarding the output synchronization is mixed. Kose,
Prasad and Terrones (2003) report evidence of stronger comovements of output in industrialized
countries with a world factor, since the early 1980’s, than in the preceding two decades. However,
Doyle and Faust (2005), testing for changes in comovements among real activity measures for
the G7 countries find very few statistically significant changes over the 1960-2000 period. When
looking at their point estimates, they even find some evidence of a fall in the correlation across
countries since the early 1980s. Such a reduced synchronization is in fact consistent with findings
of Helbling and Bayoumi (2003), Monfort, Renne, Ruﬀer and Vitale (2003), Heathcote and Perri
(2004), Stock and Watson (2005), and Kose, Otrok and Whiteman (2005). According to Stock
and Watson (2005), and Kose et al. (2005), the fact that the output correlations across countries
were particularly high in the 1970s may reflect unusually strong common shocks, such as large
movements in oil prices, during that period. These authors thus argue that the reduction in the
2

Similar comovements in economic activity have been documented for more restricted sets of countries. Gerlach
(1988) found that industrial production is positively correlated across several OECD countries. Backus, Kehoe
and Kydland (1995) and Baxter (1995) found that business cycles share similarities in major industrial economies.
Gregory, Head and Raynauld (1997) in an early estimation of a factor model on economic activity data for the G7
countries, detected a significant common factor across countries. Bergman, Bordo and Jonung (1998), analyzing more
than one hundred years of data, found that the synchronization in activity across 13 industrialized countries remains
strong regardless of the monetary regime. Forni, Hallin, Lippi and Reichlin (2000), proposing a generalized dynamic
factor model and applying it to data of 10 European economies, find that a common European activity factor explains
between 35% and 96% of the volatility in countries’ GDP. Clark and Shin (2000), similarly find that a common factor
accounts substantial variations in industrial production of European economies, and Lumsdaine and Prasad (2003),
examining correlations between industrial output in 17 OECD countries and a common component, find evidence of
a world business cycle and of a European business cycle. Canova, Ciccarelli and Ortega (2004), estimating a Bayesian
panel VAR model on G7 data find also a significant world business cycle, but find no evidence of a cycle specific to
the Euro area, in contrast to some of the other studies.

volatility of common international shocks since in the early 1980s, compared to the 1960s and 1970s,
provides an important explanation for the reduced synchronization among G7 countries since the
early 1980s, and that the correlation in output across countries would have been larger, had the
international common shocks been as important in the 1980s and the 1990s, as they were in the
1960s and 1970s.
In addition, some authors have argued that the development of trade in goods and services,
especially with low-cost producing economies such as China and India may have altered the relationship between some measure of the output gap and domestic inflation (see, e.g., Rogoﬀ (2004),
Borio and Filardo (2006), Ihrig et al. (2007)).
While we also seek to characterize changes US macroeconomic dynamics due to global forces,
our paper distinguishes itself from the papers just mentioned in several respects.
First, in general, global co-movements among macro variables could arise from the presence of
exogenous global – or worldwide – shocks, or from the international transmission of domestic
shocks. Our central focus in this paper is the implications for monetary policy of the changes in
the role of global forces. It is thus important to stress that while we allow for the presence of global
shocks like in many of the papers just cited, our interest will be mainly on the characterization of
the international transmission of regional shocks. In particular, we determine to what extent the
transmission of U.S. monetary policy shocks – as measured by exogenous changes in the Federal
funds rate – to key US economic variables such as long-term interest rates, output, inflation, and
so on, has been altered by global forces.
Second, in order to identify the monetary transmission mechanism, we jointly model multiple
dimensions of the US economy. Thus, rather than restricting ourself to the comparison of a single
type of measures across regions of the world – e.g. only economic activity measures or only inflation
measures – we adopt a more general and encompassing approach which allows us to compare a set
of factors summarizing the US macroeconomic dynamics with those summarizing the rest of the
world’s macroeconomic dynamics. Another contribution is hence to consider a much broader set
of macroeconomic indicators than has been used before in order to document the changes in the
importance of global forces for the determination of US measures of real activity, inflation, interest
rates and various other series.
4

Finally, we focus on the evolution since 1984. Our sample includes the period during which
the globalization of financial flows accelerated significantly and allows us to sidestep an important
issue: the considerable changes that occurred in the preceding decade. The period of large common
shocks, in the 1970s and the early 1980s, during which the business cycles of many countries were
strongly correlated, was followed in the US by a rapid adjustment – called “great moderation” –
to a regime characterized by lower output volatility.3 Some studies have explained the reduction
in volatility with a reduced volatility of shocks (e.g., Stock and Watson (2002a), Sims and Zha
(2006), Justiniano and Primiceri (2006), Smets and Wouters (2007)). In addition, as documented
in Clarida, Galí and Gertler (2000), Boivin (2006), Cogley and Sargent (2001, 2005), Boivin and
Giannoni (2002, 2006a), the systematic response of US monetary policy to fluctuations in inflation
and output has changed significantly around 1980, revealing a greater tendency to stabilize inflation
fluctuations. As Boivin and Giannoni (2006a) emphasize, such a change in policy can explain in
large part why the responses of output and inflation to an unexpected change in the Federal funds
rate of a given size have been much smaller since the early 1980s, than they were in the 1960s
and 1970s. By considering the period after 1984, i.e., a period during which both the variance of
the shocks may reasonably be assumed to have remained constant and the systematic monetary
policy rule has not been found to have dramatically changed, we hope to better isolate the eﬀect
of international factors.
It is important to stress, however, that our sample is relatively short: it contains a bit more
than 20 years of quarterly data. We expect a priori that this will make statistical relationships
harder to detect and will constitute an important constraint on the richness of the models that we
can contemplate in the empirical exercise below. This is an important sense in which we see our
analysis as an exploration of how important global forces might have become for the US economy.
But as the results seem to suggest, there is still suﬃcient statistical information in the sample that
allows us to learn something useful about changes in the economy in the recent past.
Our findings can be summarized as follows. First, we find that common factors capture on
3

Many researchers have documented a sharp drop in the volatility of the US real GDP in the early 1980s (see,
e.g., McConnell and Perez-Quiros (2000), Blanchard and Simon (2001), Boivin and Giannoni (2002), Stock and
Watson (2002a)). Stock and Watson (2005) show that other G7 countries with the exception of France have similarly
experienced lower output volatility since the mid-1980s compared to the previous decades.

average a sizable fraction of the fluctuations in US macroeconomic indicators. This provides support
for the use of our empirical model. Second, there is evidence that the role of international factors
in explaining US variables has been changing over the 1984-2005 period, but this evolution is
not systematic across series, and it is diﬃcult to see a pattern suggesting that they have become
generally more important. Some variables such as the long-term interest rates, as well as import
and export prices, however, do display a systematic increase of their correlation with global factors
throughout our sample.
We don’t find strong statistical evidence of a significant change in the transmission mechanism
of monetary policy due to global forces. Taking our point estimates literally, global forces do not
seem to have played an important role in the US monetary transmission mechanism between 1984
and 1999. Also, since 2000, the initial response of the US economy following a monetary policy
shock – the first 6 to 8 quarters – is essentially that same as the one that has been observed
in the 1984-1999 period. However, point estimates suggest that the growing importance of global
forces might have contributed to reducing some of the persistence in the responses, two or more
years after the shocks.
Overall, we conclude that if global forces have had an eﬀect on the monetary transmission
mechanism, this is a recent phenomenon. This means however that we will need more data before
we can get strong statistical conclusions on this question.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the econometric framework adopted and the estimation approach. In Section 3, we present empirical results on the
comovements between international factors and US data, and document changes in these relationships over the last two decades. In Section 4, we document to what extent the role of global factors
has changed the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. Section 5 concludes.

Econometric Framework: FAVAR

One key objective of this study is to evaluate the importance of the rest of the world in the
transmission of US monetary policy. That is, we seek to estimate to what extent the response of
the rest of the world’s economy enhances or mitigates the eﬀect of US monetary policy on the US

6

economy, and, importantly, whether this has changed over time. The FAVAR model described in
Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz (2005) (BBE) provides a natural framework to address these questions.
In this section, we describe the empirical model and our estimation approach.

2.1

Description of FAVAR

The econometric framework that we consider is based on the FAVAR extended to include international factors. We consider two regions: the US economy and the rest of the world, which we denote
with *. We assume that in each region, the state of the economy, which is possibly unobserved, can
be summarized by a K ×1 vector Ct in the US, and a K ∗ ×1 vector Ct∗ for the rest of the world. We
measure the state of the economy in each region with large vectors of macroeconomic indicators,
denoted by Xt for the US, and Xt∗ for the rest of the world. These vectors are of dimension N × 1
and N ∗ × 1 respectively. The indicators are assumed to relate to the state of the economy in each
region according to the observation equations

Xt = ΛCt + et

(1)

Xt∗ = Λ∗ Ct∗ + e∗t

(2)

where Λ and Λ∗ are matrices of factor loadings of appropriate dimensions, and the N ×1 (respectively
N ∗ × 1) vectors et and e∗t contain (mean-zero) series-specific components that are uncorrelated with
the common components Ct (respectively Ct∗ ), but are allowed to be serially correlated and weakly
correlated across indicators. The number of common factors is assumed to be small relative to the
number of indicators, i.e., N > K and N ∗ > K ∗ .
Under this structure, Ct and Ct∗ constitute two sets of components which are common to all data
series in the respective region and in general correlated across regions. Equations (1)—(2) reflect
the fact that the common factors represent pervasive forces that drive the common dynamics of
the data, and summarize at each date the state of the economy in each region. The variables in Xt
are thus noisy measures of the underlying unobserved factors Ct . Note that it is in principle not
restrictive to assume that Xt depends only on the current values of the factors, as Ct can always

7

capture arbitrary lags of some fundamental factors.4 The unobserved factors should reflect general
region-specific economic conditions such as “economic activity,” the “general level of prices,” the
level of “productivity,” and key dimensions of the interest-rate term structure, which may not easily
be captured by a few time series, but rather by a wide range of economic variables.
The dynamics of the common factors are modeled as a structural VAR

where Φ0 is a matrix of appropriate size on which we will later impose some restrictions, Φ(L) is
a conformable lag polynomial of finite order, and the “structural” shocks vt and vt∗ are assumed
to be iid with mean zero and diagonal covariance matrix Q and Q∗ respectively. While these
shocks are uncorrelated, anyone of these shocks may aﬀect common factors of the other region
immediately or over time, through the oﬀ-diagonal elements of Φ0 and Φ (L) . This structural VAR
has a reduced-form representation obtained by premultiplying on both sides of (3) by Φ−1

where the reduced-form innovations ut and u∗t are cross-correlated.
Since we will ultimately be interested in characterizing the eﬀects of monetary policy on the
economy, we include in the vector of US common components an observable measure of the monetary policy stance. As in most related VAR applications, we assume that the Federal funds rate,
Rt , is the policy instrument. The latter will be allowed to have pervasive eﬀect throughout the
economy and will thus be considered as a common component of all US data series. We thus write

Ct = ⎣

where Ft is a vector of latent macroeconomic factors summarizing the behavior of the US economy.

This is why Stock and Watson (1999) refer to (1) as a dynamic factor model.

2.2

Interpreting the FAVAR structure in an international context

The empirical model we just laid out is a dynamic factor model that links a large set of observable
indicators to a small set of common components through the observation equations (1)—(2). The
evolution of these common components is specified by the transition equation (3) or its reducedform representation (4). It is useful to spell out more clearly the economic interpretation of this
empirical model and, in particular, the relationship with possible underlying structural models.
As in Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz (2005) and in Boivin and Giannoni (2006b), we interpret
the unobserved factors, Ct and Ct∗ as corresponding to theoretical concepts or variables that would
enter a structural macroeconomic model. For instance, open-economy dynamic general equilibrium
models such as those of Benigno and Benigno (2001), Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2002), Lubik and
Schorfheide (2005), and those of many papers collected in Galí and Gertler (2007) fully characterize
the equilibrium evolution of inflation, output, interest rates, net exports and other variables in two
regions. In terms of the notation in our empirical framework, all of these variables would be in Ct
and Ct∗ . The dynamic evolution of these variables implied by such open-economy models can be
approximated by an unrestricted VAR of the form (4).5 If all of these macroeconomic concepts were
perfectly observed, the system (4) would boil down to a standard multi-country VAR and could
be estimated directly, as in, e.g., Eichenbaum and Evans (1995), Grilli and Roubini (1995,1996),
Cushman and Zha (1997), Kim and Roubini (2000), Scholl and Uhlig (2006). In such a case, there
would be no need to use the large set of indicators Xt .
However, there are reasons to believe that not all relevant concepts are perfectly observed. First,
some macroeconomic concepts are simply measured with error.6 Second, some of the macroeconomic variables which are key for the model’s dynamics may be fundamentally latent. For instance,
the concept of “potential output” often critical in monetary model cannot be measured directly. By
using a large data set, one is able to extract empirically the components that are most important
in explaining fluctuations in the entire data set. While each common component does not need to
represent any single economic concept, the common components Ct and Ct∗ should constitute a

e.g., Fernández-Villaverde, Rubio-Ramírez, Sargent and Watson (2007) and references therein.

Boivin and Giannoni (2006b) argue, for example, that inflation is imperfectly measured by any single indicator,
and that it is important to use multiple indicators of it for proper inference.

9

linear combination of all of the relevant latent variables driving the set of noisy indicators Xt and
Xt∗ , to the extent that we extract the correct number of common components from the data set.
An advantage of this empirical framework is that it provides, both for the US and the international data sets, summary measures of the state of these economies at each date, in the form
of factors which may summarize many features of the economy. We thus do not restrict ourselves
simply to measures of inflation or output. Another advantage of our approach, as BBE argue,
is that this framework should lead to a better identification of the monetary policy shock than
standard VARs, because it explicitly recognizes the large information set that the Federal Reserve
and financial market participants exploit in practice, and also because, as just argued, it does not
require to take a stand on the appropriate measures of prices and real activity which can simply be
treated as latent common components. Moreover, for a set of identifying assumptions, a natural
by-product of the estimation is to provide impulse response functions for any variable included
in the data set. This is particularly useful in our case, since we want to understand the eﬀect of
globalization on the transmission of monetary policy to a wide range of economic variables.
The empirical model (1)—(2) and (4) provides a convenient decomposition of all data series into
components driven by the US factors Ct (i.e., the Federal funds rate and other US latent factors Ft ),
non-US latent factors Ct∗ , and by series-specific components unrelated to the general state of the
economies, et or e∗t . For instance, (1) specifies that indicators of measures of US economic activity
or inflation are driven by the Federal funds rate Rt , US latent factors Ft , and a component that
is specific to each individual series (representing e.g., measurement error or other idiosyncrasies of
each series). The dynamics of the US common components are in turn specified by (4).
Note that the factors Ct and Ct∗ summarizing macroeconomic conditions in the US, respectively
in the rest of the world, may be aﬀected both by their own region-specific shocks and by worldwide
or “global” shocks. In fact, since reduced-form innovations ut and u∗t may be cross-correlated, they
could be expressed as the sum of a component that is common both the US and the rest of the
world, possibly due to “global” shocks and a component that is exclusively region specific. The

10

reduced-from VAR may thus be rewritten as
∗
Ct∗ = Ψ11 (L) Ct−1
+ Ψ12 (L) Ct−1 + Γ1 gt + ε∗t

(5)

∗
+ Ψ22 (L) Ct−1 + Γ2 gt + εt
Ct = Ψ21 (L) Ct−1

(6)

where gt is a vector of “global” exogenous shocks, and ε∗t , εt are disturbances that are specific to
each region and uncorrelated across regions.7

2.3

Estimation

As in Stock and Watson (2002b) and BBE, we estimate our empirical model using a variant of a
two-step principal component approach which we briefly outline here. We refer to these papers for
a more detailed description.
The first step consists of extracting principal components from Xt and Xt∗ to obtain consistent
estimates of the common factors under the structure laid out. In the second step, the Federal funds
rate is added to the estimated factors and the VAR in equation (4) is estimated. Note that in the
first step, BBE do not impose the constraint that the Federal funds rate is one of the common
components. So if this interest rate is really a common component, it should be captured by the
principal components. To remove the Federal funds rate from the space covered by the principal
components, BBE perform a transformation of the principal components exploiting the diﬀerent
behavior of what they call “slow moving” and “fast moving” variables, in the second step. Our
implementation is slightly diﬀerent, however. We adopt a more direct approach which consists of
imposing the constraint that Federal funds rate is one of the factors in the first-step estimation.
This guarantees that the estimated latent factors recover dimensions of the common dynamics not
captured by the Federal funds rate.8 To do so, we adopt the following procedure in the first step
(0)

of the estimation. Starting from an initial estimate of Ft , denoted by Ft

and obtained as the first

K − 1 principal components of Xt , we iterate through the following steps:
In this respect, Ct and Ct∗ have a diﬀerent interpretation than the world factors estimated by, e.g., Gregory et
al. (1997), Forni et al. (2000), Kose et al., (2003), Ciccarelli and Mojon (2005). While these authors estimate a
world factor and orthogonal region (or country)-specific factors, our estimated Ct and Ct∗ contain both fluctuations
in regional and world factors.

Having estimated the factors Ct and Ct∗ and the factor loadings Λ, Λ∗ , we can estimate the VAR
(4). As we will argue in Section 4, the matrix polynomial Ψ21 (L) will be of particular interest to us,
as it captures the eﬀects of international factors on domestic variables. For now, note that the VAR
coeﬃcients Ψij (L) are identified provided that the variance-covariance matrix of the innovations

Ct , and the domestic factors Ct do not constitute suﬃcient statistics to uncover the dynamics of the
domestic economy. In other words, the domestic economy is not a statistical “island.” Alternatively,
if the rest of the world had no region-specific shocks, so that E (ε∗t ε∗0
t ) = 0, then Ψ21 (L) would not
be identified, as international factors would bring no additional information. The estimate of the
VAR coeﬃcients Ψ21 (L) will thus rely on the presence of independent variations originating in the
rest of the world, and the Granger-causality tests that we report below will guarantee that there is
indeed suﬃcient such variation.

Data

The data we use for the estimation of the FAVAR are a balanced panel of 720 quarterly series for the
period running from 1984:1 to 2005:2. The data series are listed in the Appendix. They comprise
671 US series. Among these, there are 129 macroeconomic indicators that measure economic
activity, employment, prices, interest rates, exchange rates and other key financial variables. In
addition, we include the 542 series of disaggregate consumption, and consumer and producer price
series used in Boivin, Giannoni and Mihov (2007). As discussed in that paper, disaggregate price

In terms of IV intuition, to estimate Ψ12 (L) , we need some independent variation in Ct∗ in order to be able to
use it as an instrument for itself in equation (6). For a formal treatment of this argument, see Hausman and Taylor
(1983).

data provide useful information for the appropriate estimation of the monetary policy shocks, and
are found to mitigate the price puzzle obtained in conventional VARs or factor models which omit
that information. For the rest of the world, we consider a panel of 49 quarterly data series for the
15 main US trade partners. This data set includes for each country, measures of economic activity,
prices, and short and long-term interest rates (if available). All data series have been transformed
to induce stationarity, and the transformations applied are indicated in the Appendix.

2.5

Preferred specification of the FAVAR

For the model selection, there are two important observations to keep in mind. First, the sample
size severely constrains the class of specifications we can consider, especially the number of lags
in (4), as the number of factors gets large. Second, in trying to identify the monetary policy
transmission mechanism, we are more worried about bias than eﬃciency. Available information
criteria for selecting the number of factors are thus not clearly adequate in that respect. Our
general approach for selecting our preferred specification has thus been to try with up to twenty
domestic factors and up to 10 foreign factors.
It turns out that irrespective of the number of factors that we include, the Bayesian information
criterion selects 1 lag in (4) over the post-1984 sample. We found that including more than 10
domestic factors and 4 global factors did not change substantially the dynamic response of the
economy to monetary policy, although, obviously, the uncertainty around the estimates increases
with more factors. In fact, very similar results are obtained with as few as 6 domestic factors and
3 foreign factors, although point estimates suggest some price puzzle for some of the price series.
Our preferred specification thus includes 10 domestic latent factors and 4 global factors, and
the transition equation (4) has 1 lag.

International Factors and US Economic Dynamics

Several studies have recently attempted to the determine the degree of comovement of a few macroeconomic series across countries. For instance Kose, Otrok, Whiteman (2003, 2005), Stock and
Watson (2005) study the comovement of economic activity measures and Ciccarelli and Mojon

13

(2005) focus on inflation. In this paper, rather than restricting ourself to the comparison of a single
type of measures across regions of the world, we use our FAVAR framework to compare how the
factors summarizing the US macroeconomic dynamics relate to the rest of the world’s factors.10 If
global forces are important to describe the dynamics of the US economy, they should be captured
by the latent factor space of the FAVAR. We use the common factors extracted from our large
data set and determine the fraction of fluctuations in US indicators of real activity, inflation and
interest rates that can be explained by US and global factors respectively. After showing to what
extent key US economic variables co-move with US and international factors, we determine whether
these relationships have changed since the mid-1980s. We then attempt to measure whether foreign
factors do “cause” (in a Granger sense) fluctuations in US factors. In the next section, we report
how monetary policy shocks aﬀect a large number of variables, how the transmission mechanism
has changed over time, and to what extent the change is due to international factors.

3.1

Comovements between US and international factors

We first start by determining to what extent US variables are correlated with US and foreign
factors. Table 1 reports the fraction of the volatility in the series listed in the first column that is
explained by the 11 US factors Ct (i.e., 10 latent factors and the Federal funds rate), the 4 foreign
factors Ct∗ , and all factors taken together. This corresponds to the R2 statistics obtained by the
regressions of these variables on the appropriate set of factors, for the entire 1984:1-2005:2 sample.
Note that since the US and international factors are allowed to be correlated, the fraction of the
variance in any given variable explained by the US factors (first column) plus that explained by the
international factors (second column) do not correspond to the fraction of the variance explained
jointly by both sets of factors (third column). However, by comparing the numbers in the third
column to the sum of the other two columns, we may have a rough sense of how the determinants
of the variable of interest may be correlated across countries.
Looking at Table 1, several observations are worth mentioning. First, the entire US data set Xt
is on average quite strongly correlated with the common factors. On average, all factors explain 45%

Justiniano (2004) similarly studies the comovement of multiple macroeconomic series between Canada, Australia,
and the rest of the world.

of the variance of US series. Most of the common fluctuations in US series is however provided by
US factors, as the R2 for these factors amounts to 0.39. However, foreign factors do also appear to
be correlated with US data series, with an R2 of 0.13. Note that, at this point, we do not attempt
to determine the origin of the fluctuations in the factors and the direction of causality between
US and international factors. We realize that in general US variables may be aﬀected by global
economic shocks which impact simultaneously US and international factors. Instead, we attempt
to assess to what extent international factors can explain fluctuations in various US macroeconomic
variables with information that is not contained in US factors.
Looking at selected US indicators, we find that quarterly growth rates of measures of real
economic activity such as quarterly averages of industrial production and employment display very
high correlations with the US factors (R2 statistics of 0.79 and 0.84 respectively). It may be
surprising that other activity measures such as real GDP or consumption from the national income
accounts do not appear as strongly correlated with the US factors, especially when compared with
existing evidence based on similar factor models. However, this is purely an artifact of our use of
quarterly growth for GDP components mixed with quarterly averages of monthly data. In fact,
the quarterly growth rates of the GDP components display more high-frequency variability than
those of (the quarterly averages of) employment and industrial production. Since that variability
is not well captured by US factors, a large fraction of these series volatility is explained by the
idiosyncratic terms. Were we to consider year-over-year growth rates of the variables, GDP and
consumption would display much larger contributions of US factors. The important point, however,
is that most of the fluctuations in industrial production, consumption, investment or employment
indicators are determined by domestic factors. While these indicators display some correlation with
the international factors, the additional explanatory power of the latter factors is relatively low.
In fact, The R2 obtained for these variables by them regressing on all factors are not much higher
than those found by regressing only on the US factors.
Quite naturally, the picture is diﬀerent for US real exports and imports, as they appear to be
much more strongly related to international factors. Adding the international factors to the US
factors increases the fraction of the variance of exports explained from 0.38 to 0.57, and raises the
R2 of imports from 0.45 to 0.55. These global factors thus contain substantial information not
16

already contained in US factors, and which is correlated with real exports and imports. Real GDP
then reflects the descriptions of its underlying components: while domestic factors are certainly
key, adding the international factors increases the R2 by 7 percentage points.
For US quarterly inflation rates, the importance of international factors varies sensibly depending on the price index used. Inflation of the producer price index, for instance is well described by
US factors and displays very little correlation with international factors. However, growth rates of
the US GDP deflator and of consumer prices, whether based on the CPI or the personal PCE deflator, are more correlated with international factors. The latter factors explain 37% of fluctuations
in inflation of the PCE deflator. Nonetheless, the international factors don’t seem to explain much
more of consumer price inflation than what is explained by US domestic factors. This suggests
that the US and international factors which explain well inflation are strongly correlated. This is
consistent with Ciccarelli and Mojon (2005), who find that an important component of consumer
price inflation is shared globally. For the GDP deflator, however, global factors contain information
not included in US factors. In fact, regressing this indicator on all factors raises the R2 to 0.69
compared to 0.54, when we consider only US factors. One possible explanation is that export prices
depend sensibly on international factors in a way that is not captured by US factors. The inflation
rate of the exports’ deflator does however not appear to be strongly correlated with international
factors, over our entire sample. As we will see below, though, this low correlation with international
factors is deceptive as it appears to be due to considerable instability over the sample.
The nominal exchange rate is strongly correlated with domestic factors, and the R2 with international factors is 0.27, but these global factors seem to contain surprisingly little information no
already contained in the domestic factors, and the R2 with all factors is only a little higher than
the one with only US factors.
Finally for nominal interest rates, the Federal funds rate is by assumption a US factor, but it
is also strongly correlated with international factors. Similarly, the long-term US interest rate is
very strongly correlated with US and international factors. This suggests that all of the countries
considered in our data set are aﬀected by a common factor resembling US interest rates.

17

3.2

Have US and international forces become more strongly correlated?

Overall, the evidence reported in Table 1 indicates that most selected key US variables are strongly
correlated with US factors and to a lesser extent with international factors. Such results have been
obtained for the sample that runs from 1984:1 to 2005:2. As mentioned in the introduction, though,
the US economy’s trade in goods and services with the rest of the world has expanded considerably,
and the financial globalization, as measured by the sum of external assets and liabilities, has
developed at an unprecedented pace, during this period.
Such dramatic developments are likely to have aﬀected the relationship between US variables
and international factors. To date, however, the evidence about change in the synchronization of
the US economy with the rest of the world is mixed. While Kose, Prasad and Terrones (2003)
find stronger comovements of output in industrialized countries with a world factor, since the early
1980’s, than in the preceding two decades, Doyle and Faust (2005) little evidence of statistically
significant changes, and Helbling and Bayoumi (2003), Monfort, Renne, Ruﬀer and Vitale (2003),
Heathcote and Perri (2004), Stock and Watson (2005), and Kose, Otrok and Whiteman (2005) find
reductions in the synchronization of output fluctuations across countries. In addition, these studies
typically consider the period subsequent to the mid-1980s as a whole, and do not allow for changes
during that period.
Several observers have nonetheless suggested that key macroeconomic variables might have
become more dependent on the state of the economy in the rest of the world, in the last few
years. Chairman Bernanke (2007) pointed out that long-term interest rates in the US have become
sensibly more correlated with those of Germany and other industrialized economies. Some have
argued that US inflation may have become more strongly aﬀected by international developments,
such as the rise of China as a source of goods and services sold in the US (see, e.g., Rogoﬀ (2004),
Kamin, Marazzi, Schindler (2006), Borio and Filardo (2006), Ihrig et al. (2007)). While some US
variables may well have become more strongly correlated with international factors, our framework
allows us to assess whether a large number of macroeconomic variables in the US have become
systematically more synchronized with the factors of its major trade partners.
It is important to keep in mind that a formal empirical analysis of the recent changes due

18

to the greater globalization is diﬃcult, and faces limits, as the data samples are still very short.
Nevertheless, our framework provides a rich account of these changes since 1984, which can show
to what extent the global components have revealed changes in the correlations with US variables.
Figures 1-2 document the comovement of US variables with global forces over time. They show the
fraction of the variability in US variables explained by the global factors, where the estimation is
done using a 10 year rolling window. The dates correspond to the mid-point of that window.

These figures reveal several interesting results. First, they show that international factors have
not become more strongly correlated with a broad set of US variables since 1984. The regressions
of the US common components on all international components result in R2 statistics that have not
increased on average. Second, despite a fairly constant correlation between international and US
factors, when taken as a whole, the importance of global forces on some individual US variables has
varied considerably over the sample. Part of that variation certainly reflects the short samples, and
may exaggerate the nature of the true changes. Nonetheless, the R2 of the regression of real GDP
growth on international factor fell from 1995 (corresponding to the period that spans 1990-2000)
to 2000 (i.e., the period that spans 1995-2005). A similar evolution can be found for consumption,
investment and imports, though the R2 found at the end of the sample are not very diﬀerent from
those obtained at the beginning of the sample. US exports, however, do seem to be more strongly
correlated with international factors after the mid-1990s, with R2 doubling from approximately
0.20 to 0.40.
In terms of prices, inflation in export prices is increasingly more correlated with the international
factors throughout the sample. While international factors explain only about 20% of the variance
of the export prices’ inflation rate around 1990, they explain close to 70% of this variance a decade
later. Import prices similarly see their correlation with international factors steadily increase over
time. This is consistent with the idea that import prices have been rising more slowly than other
consumer prices due in part to an increase in imports from low-cost emerging economies. In fact,
Kamin, Marazzi and Schindler (2006) find that trade with China has reduced inflation in import
prices by about 1 percentage point. This ends up being reflected in a greater correlation the
international factors with US inflation as measured by the CPI, but surprisingly, there is no such

eﬀect on the inflation rate of PCE prices. In addition, there is no evidence that the GDP deflator
has become more strongly correlated with international factors since the mid-1990s. If anything,
the R2 statistic has decreased since 1995 for the inflation based on the GDP deflator and on the
PCE deflator. These findings contrast sharply with the claims often made that US inflation may
have become increasingly determined in the rest of the world (e.g., Borio and Filardo (2006)), but
are consistent with the results of Ihrig, Kamin, Lindner and Marquez (2007).
Regarding interest rates, the Federal funds rate appears very strongly correlated with international factors until the mid-1995s, and again by the year 2000. But in the second half of the 1990s,
the Federal funds rate appears to disconnect from the international factors for several years. For
10-year rates, the correlation with international factors seems to increase by the late 1990s, a fact
consistent with the finding by Bernanke (2007) that long-term yields in industrialized countries
have become more strongly correlated in the last few years. While we do not attempt to determine
why that correlation has increased, we note that it does not necessarily imply that US rates are
determined to a greater extent on foreign capital market. In fact, such a finding is also consistent
with the idea that US monetary policy may now have larger eﬀects on international bond markets
at the same time as it aﬀects US financial markets (see Ehrmann, Fratzscher and Rigobon, 2005;
Faust et al. 2006).
Finally, while the value of the US dollar seems to have been strongly correlated with international
factors for a large part of the 1990s, the recent decline in the value of the dollar appears to have
had little relation with global factors. Instead, it has been much more determined by US domestic
factors.
While these Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2 have provided an interesting account of the relationship
between various US macroeconomic variables and international factors, the numbers reported are
however merely correlations, and do not imply that fluctuations in US variables such as the Federal
funds rate are caused by changes in international conditions. It may well be that changes in US
conditions may be suﬃciently important to cause changes in foreign factors.

3.3.1

Testing the relevance of global forces for US fluctuations
Granger causality tests

To check formally whether global forces do matter for US fluctuations, we now turn to Granger
causality tests. Results are presented in Table 2. In Panel A, we test whether the lags of all
∗ , jointly have predictive power for the current values of US factors C
international factors, Ct−1
t

listed in the first column, over and beyond lags of domestic factors, Ct−1 . Under the null hypothesis,
foreign factors have no predictive power. The table suggests that all but one US common factors,
including the Fed funds rate, are Granger-caused by international factors at the 5% level over the
entire sample considered. The evidence is somewhat weaker when we perform the test over the
1984:1 to 1994:4 period. At this stage, this might only be reflecting lower power of the test over the
smaller sub-samples. Interestingly, however, combined with the evidence that we report in Section
4, it seems that global factors were not very important to explain US economic dynamics before
the late 1990’s.
This evidence implies that the feedback from the rest of the world to the US economy as
measured by Ψ21 (L) , and to which we return in Section 4, are identified.

23

3.3.2

Has the influence of international factors on US factors increased over the last
two decades?

As the comparison of the Granger causality tests between the two subsamples crudely suggests,
the relationship of the global factors with the US economy might have changed over time. In fact,
if there is any content to the claims that the greater economic integration between the US and
the rest of the world has aﬀected the dynamics of US economic variables, the Granger causality
relationship must have changed over time.
One way to get formal evidence on this question is to test for the stability of the Granger
causality relationships. We do so using the Quandt likelihood ratio test (QLR), the asymptotic
distribution of which has been derived by Andrews (1993).11 We apply the test jointly to all global
factors.
The results are reported in Table 3. As is clear from the table, we reject stability at the 5%
level in most cases. Based on this, one important observation is that even though we have a fairly
short sample, the latter contains suﬃcient information to allow us to detect statistically significant
changes. It remains to be investigated whether these changes have been suﬃciently important,
economically speaking, to aﬀect the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. Interestingly, the
Federal funds rate is the only variable for which the stability is not rejected. The data thus suggests
that while the setting of the Federal funds rate is has been aﬀected by global factors, the role of
the latter factors does not seem to have changed significantly in our sample.

4

Implications for the Monetary Transmission Mechanism

In the last section, we determined that some of US factors have become more synchronized with
international factors over the last two decades. A natural question that arises then is to what
extent has US monetary policy become more constrained by the expansion of international trade,
and to a larger extent by the much greater globalization of finance. Do global forces mitigate the
eﬀects of US monetary policy more than they used to?
There is little doubt that, despite this globalization, the Federal Reserve has retained its capacity
11
In doing so, we ignore the uncertainty in the factor estimates. When the cross section of macro indicators is
large, the uncertainty in the factor estimates should be negligible asymptotically (see Bai and Ng (2006)).

to align the Federal funds rate with its target rate by managing the supply of funds in the interbank
market. It is thus still reasonable to think of the Federal funds rate as being the instrument of
monetary policy. As other short-term rates such as yields on 3-month or 6 month US Treasury
securities remain very strongly correlated with actual Federal funds rate (the correlation between
the Federal funds rate and 3-months securities is above 0.99 for the period 1984-2007 and has
remained as high since 2000) they can still be viewed as primarily aﬀected by monetary policy.
Clearly, longer-term interest rates reflect at least in part expectations of future short-term
rates, and depend on announcements provided by central bankers. Longer-term rates have however
become more strongly correlated with international factors in recent years, as mentioned above.
Part of this change may reflect a greater influence of international capital markets on US long-term
rates.12 Alternatively, US factors may have more impact on international capital markets (see
Ehrmann, Fratzscher, Rigobon (2005), Faust et al. (2006)). At the same time, since monetary
policy’s eﬀect on other variables such as economic activity and inflation is believed to depend
partly on long-term rates, it is possible that these other variables might have become less aﬀected by
Federal funds rate movements. In addition, the increase in international trade in goods and services
may explain why US import and export prices have become more correlated with international
factors. A natural question then is what are the implications of these changes for the transmission

Empirical strategy

In the context of our FAVAR framework, we can characterize the transmission mechanism of monetary policy by computing the response of selected macroeconomic series to an identified monetary
policy shock. In the spirit of VAR analyses, we impose only the minimum number of restrictions
needed to identify the policy shock. This allows us to document some facts about the evolution
of the monetary transmission mechanism that should not be otherwise contaminated by auxiliary
assumptions.
Recall that the structural representation of our VAR transition equation takes the form (3),
where again Ct = [Ft0 , Rt ]0 . To identify monetary policy shocks, i.e., the surprise changes in the
Federal funds rate, we assume that the latent factors Ft and Ct∗ cannot respond to innovations in Rt
in the period of the shock. The Fed funds rate, however, is allowed to respond to contemporaneous
fluctuations in such factors. We thus impose the restriction that the matrix Φ0 in (3) has ones
on the main diagonal, and zeroes in the last column, except for the lower right element, which is
one. This has the implication that the monetary policy shock enters only in the last element of the
innovations vector ut in the reduced-form VAR (4), which we repeat here for convenience:

⎥
⎦⎣

⎦+⎣
⎦.
Ψ21 (L) Ψ22 (L)
Ct
Ct−1
ut

As mentioned above, the matrix polynomials Ψ12 (L) and Ψ21 (L) determine the magnitude of
the spillovers between the US and the rest of the world’s economic variables. When Ψ21 (L) = 0, the
rest of the world has no spillovers on the US economy, meaning that fluctuations in foreign economic
variables do not cause (in the sense of Granger) any fluctuations in US variables. Following a US
monetary policy shock, Ψ21 (L) measures the extent to which the rest of the world contributes to
the transmission of the US monetary policy domestically.
Our strategy involves computing impulse response functions to a monetary policy shock in the
system above, and comparing them to those obtained with diﬀerent values of Ψ21 (L) . The diﬀerence

26

between these impulse responses provides a measure of the importance of the endogenous response
of the rest of the world in the US transmission of monetary policy. (Note that in both cases, Ct∗
is allowed to move only in response to the monetary shock.) In addition, to the extent that the
greater integration of the world economies has changed the role played by the rest of the world
in the transmission of US monetary policy, this should imply a change in Ψ21 (L). Consequently,
by documenting the changes over time in Ψ21 (L) and its implications on the impulse response
functions, it is possible to evaluate whether globalization has reduced the ability of US monetary
policy to aﬀect domestic variables.
To illustrate more directly the exercise we perform, let us consider a simplified version of this
model in which the macroeconomic factors are actually observed. To fix ideas more concretely,
think of the set of relevant domestic factors Ct as being given by the domestic (or world) interest
rate Rt and domestic real activity Yt , and the foreign factors Ct∗ as corresponding foreign real
activity Yt∗ . Let us assume that the structural model relating these variables is as follows:
∗
+ ψ 12 Yt−1 + ψ 13 Rt−1 + gt + ε∗t
Yt∗ = ψ 11 Yt−1
∗
Yt = ψ 21 Yt−1
+ ψ 22 Yt−1 + ψ 23 Rt−1 + gt + εt

Rt = φYt−1 + η t
where ε∗t and εt are region-specific output shocks and gt is a worldwide shock. The first two
equations are reduced-form equations determining output in both regions, while the third equation
can be interpreted as an interest-rate rule, so that η t can be viewed as a monetary policy shock.
In this context, our approach consists of comparing the impulse response functions of Yt and Rt
implied by this unrestricted system, with those obtained for diﬀerent values of ψ 21 . For instance,
setting ψ 21 = 0 is equivalent to assuming that domestic variables are not aﬀected by international
developments. Comparing the two sets of impulse response functions thus provides a way to assess the importance of the “feedback” or “spillover” from the rest of the world in explaining the
transmission mechanism of monetary policy.
In this simple context, whether or not our strategy identifies the eﬀect of international factors
– i.e. the eﬀect of Yt∗ – in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy depends solely on
27

whether the parameter ψ 21 is identified. As mentioned in section 2, ψ 21 is identified provided
that the variances of εt and ε∗t are nonzero. If var(ε∗t ) were equal to zero, the system would be
reduced-ranked and it would not be possible to identify separately all the parameters ψ ij , as Yt∗
and Yt would be perfectly collinear. Notice that the condition that var(εt ) > 0 and var(ε∗t ) > 0 is
equivalent to saying that Yt∗ Granger causes Yt (conditional on past values of Yt ).
It is important to note that our analysis does not identify directly “worldwide shocks” which
would aﬀect simultaneously domestic and international factors (such as the shock gt ) in the example
above, in the absence of further restrictions. It is however not necessary to identify such global
shocks in order to quantify the eﬀects of international factors of the transmission of US monetary
policy shocks.
For illustration purposes, in this simple example, we assumed that the factors Ct and Ct∗ were
perfectly observed. In our application, however, these factors are unobserved and relate to a large
set informative variables according to (1) and (2). This does not change any of the arguments just
made in the context of the simple example. Once we have estimates of Ct and Ct∗ , we are back in
the world described in the previous example. The matrix polynomial Ψ21 (L) is similarly identified
when the matrix var(ε∗t ) is full rank or, alternatively, provided that Ct∗ Granger causes Ct .

4.2

Implementation

In estimating the FAVAR over the sample 1984:1-2005:2, we allow for the possibility that the
international factors may aﬀect US variables diﬀerently after the year 2000. More specifically, we
expand the VAR system of our FAVAR with a dummy variable interacted with all the lags of the
foreign factors. More precisely, we estimate the following system

where dt takes the value 0 for the period 1984:1-1999:4 and 1 after. That means that the coeﬃcients
on the lag international factors in the equations for Ct are equal to Ψ21 (L) for 1984:1-1999:4, and
to Ψ21 (L) + Ψd21 (L) thereafter. Given that our preferred specification has only one lag, notice that

28

allowing for this form of instability requires estimating 4 additional parameters per equation, so it
is not too costly in terms of degrees of freedom.

4.3

The eﬀects of monetary policy shocks

Figures 3 and 4 show the estimated impulse responses of a set of macroeconomic indicators to
a tightening of monetary policy, that is, an innovation in the Federal funds rate corresponding
to an unexpected increase of 25 basis points. The solid lines represent the responses computed
using the relationship between the US factors and the international factors as estimated during
the 1984:1 to 1999:4 period, along with the 70% confidence intervals.13 The dashed lines, instead,
display the responses using the same FAVAR, but assuming that the US and international factors
relate as estimated after 2000. A comparison of these two sets of impulse responses allows us
to gauge the eﬀects on the monetary transmission mechanism of the changes in the relationship
between international factors and US variables. In fact, between the two sets of responses, the only
relationships that are allowed to change are those that describe how foreign factors end up aﬀecting
US data. Note that by doing so, we maximize the length of our sample in the estimation, yet we
allow for a change in the role of international factors.

As the impulse responses based on the eﬀects of international factors estimated for the 1984:1
- 1999:4 sample reveal in Figures 3 and 4, an unexpected tightening in monetary policy results
in a gradual decline in real GDP, which tends to revert back to the original level after about 3
years. Other measures of activity, such as industrial production and employment both respond in
a similar way. Consumption also shows a similar although smaller response, while investment falls
much more. Together with the fall in domestic demand, imports fall in response to the interest
rate increase. The reduction in imports appears to be reinforced by a significant appreciation in
the value of the US dollar, lasting about 2 years following the shock. Exports to the rest of the
world also fall significantly following the monetary tightening. This is consistent with the fact that
the US dollar appreciates, and that output in foreign trade partners falls (not reported).
All price indices (reported in levels) show little response on impact, but also tend to fall pro13

The confidence intervals were obtained using Kilian’s (1998) bootstrap procedure.

gressively, and in a persistent way, following the monetary tightening. However, while the import
and export price deflators seem to respond rapidly to the shock, it takes about 3 quarters for the
GDP deflator and the CPI to show any movement. While the import price response may reflect
a slowing domestic economy, the response of export prices may be explained by a drop in foreign
demand for US goods, due both to an appreciating US dollar and to a slowing foreign economy.

4.4

Has the role of global forces on the US monetary transmission changed?

We find little overall evidence that global forces have had a important eﬀect on the US monetary
transmission mechanism, and find little evidence of change over the last several years. To determine
to what extent the response of macroeconomic variables to a monetary tightening has changed recently, we compare the impulse responses based on the FAVAR involving the link between domestic
and international factors as estimated since 2000 (dashed lines) to those based on international
factors in the 1984-1999 period (solid lines). One interesting conclusion that emerges from this
exercise is that the variables display in both cases almost identical responses in the first 6 to 7
quarters following the shock. After that, the responses based on the most recent international
factors reveal a slightly more rapid return to the initial level. The output and various measures of
prices, for instance, show less persistent responses to the monetary tightening. But most changes
are not statistically significant. Only for the Federal funds rate, the long-term interest rate and
the exchange rate do we have sharper evidence that the impulse responses have changed after 3 or
4 years, when using the more recent factors. And the expectation of a higher Federal funds rate
three or more years following the shock is reflected in a slightly higher value of the 10-year yield.
The changes in the impulse responses just documented were obtained by allowing a diﬀerent
relationship between the US and international factors starting in the year 2000. For robustness,
we checked with alternative break dates, and found that in all cases, the changes were similar or
smaller than those reported in the figures. This suggests that if there has been a change in the
response to monetary policy shock, this phenomenon is very recent.
In brief, we found no evidence that the responses of a large number of key US variables to
monetary policy shocks have changed in the first 6-7 quarters following the shock. However, we
found some evidence that the relationship between US and international factors has changed in
32

such a way as to imply a lower persistence in the response to monetary policy shocks 8 or more
quarters after the shock.
How important are global forces for the monetary transmission? When the Federal Reserve
changes the course of monetary policy, it aﬀects both US and international factors. The response
of the latter may in turn constrain the response of the US economy. A crude way of assessing
the role of global forces in the transmission of US monetary policy it to report the responses of
US macroeconomic variables to a monetary policy shock, but assuming that the US factors do
not respond to global factors. Specifically, we compute the responses of the monetary shock by
setting to zero the submatrices Ψ21 and Ψd21 referring to the international factors Ct∗ . These impulse
responses that abstract from international factors are shown with dashed-dotted lines in Figures 3
and 4.
A striking conclusion is that these responses almost perfectly replicate those estimated with
the international factors in the 1984-1999 period (solid lines). It follows that the global factors in
that period don’t seem to have more than a marginal impact on the response of the US economy
to monetary shocks. Of course, we are not saying that global factors do not have an impact on the
economy, and that the Federal Reserve does not need to give any consideration to the international
economic situation. In fact, as we reported in the previous section, several key variable are strongly
correlated with international factors. Our results suggest, however, that conditional on changing
the Federal funds rate in a particular way, the response of the main US macroeconomic variables
have been little aﬀected by the response of international factors.
It is important, however, to keep in mind that in the counterfactual experiment just described
as well as in our assessment of the change over time in the eﬀect of foreign factors, we assume that
the coeﬃcients measuring the response of US variables to US factors as well as those characterizing
the dynamics of the US factors do not change. While we would in principle want to allow for
possible changes over time in the latter coeﬃcients, such exercises are unfortunately unlikely to
provide reliable results in our empirical model, given the number of extra parameters that we
would need to estimate, and given our relatively short sample. Such an assumption may well not
be satisfied. For instance, several authors have argued that the slope of the Phillips curve relating
US inflation to domestic measures of marginal costs or of activity may have changed following the
33

greater economic integration of the US with the rest of the world. However, Sbordone (2007) and
Woodford (2007) argue, in simple calibrated models, that such changes are unlikely to be large.
Another possibility is that the processes determining expectations about future domestic variables
be altered by the greater openness of the domestic economy. By not letting the relationships
among domestic variables change in our empirical model with the increased globalization, we are
technically subject to the Lucas critique. One would thus need a fully-specified forward-looking
structural model to account for this issue.

Conclusion

It has been widely documented that international trade has continued to advance, and that the
globalization of finance has seen an extraordinary expansion since the mid 1980s. In this context,
several observers have argued that global factors may now have a greater influence than in the
past on the determination of key US macroeconomic variables, and that conditions in international
capital markets may impose more constraints on the transmission of monetary policy.
In this paper, we have attempted to quantify the changes in the relationship between international forces and the US economy over the 1984-2005 period. To do so, we have used an empirical
model that allows us to summarize the macroeconomic conditions of the US economy and of the
rest of the world with a small number of factors. This framework allows us to quantify the extent of comovement between many key US macroeconomic variables and international factors. It
allows us to characterize empirically the transmission of monetary policy shocks to a large set of
macroeconomic indicators.
Our findings can be summarized as follows. First, we find that common factors capture on
average a sizable fraction of the fluctuations in US macroeconomic indicators. This provides support
to the use of our empirical model. Second, there is evidence that the role of international factors
in explaining US variables has been changing over the 1984-2005 period, but this evolution is not
systematic across series, and it is diﬃcult to see a pattern suggesting that international factors have
become generally more important. Some variables such as the long-term interest rates, as well as
import and export prices, however, do display a systematic increase of their correlation with global

34

factors throughout our sample.
We don’t find strong statistical evidence of a significant change in the transmission mechanism
of monetary policy due to global forces. Taking our point estimates literally, global forces do not
seem to have played an important role in the US monetary transmission mechanism between 1984
and 1999. This does not mean that global factors do not have an impact on the economy, as
other shocks, such as international shocks, may have an important eﬀect on US economic variables.
However, our results suggest that conditional on a monetary policy shock in the US, the response
of the main US macroeconomic variables have been little aﬀected by the response of international
factors.
In addition, since the year 2000, the initial response of the US economy following a monetary
policy shock – the first 6 to 8 quarters – is essentially the same as the one that has been observed
in the 1984-1999 period. However, point estimates suggest that the growing importance of global
forces might have contributed to reducing some of the persistence in the responses, two or more
years after the shocks.
Overall, we conclude that if global forces have had an eﬀect on the monetary transmission
mechanism, this is a recent phenomenon. This means however that we will need more data before
we can get strong statistical conclusions on this question.
