the payment of nominal interest on money is
generally not a perfect substitute for
a steady state rate of deflation
as a means of achieving a
given real return on money. The tax on capital
will depend on the composition of the real return
on money between nominal interest payments and deflation.

will depend on the rate of

inflation. The wedge will also be affected
by any reserve requirement that
forces banks to hold non-interest bearing reserves. Further effects

arise if inflation has a direct effect on

the return to capital because of a nonindexed tax
system. In this case,
all values of i and it

for

which i -

it = rk

are not equivalent since it

affects

the wedge between the returns on capital and base
money (reserves plus currency). The optimal rate of inflation will also
depend
on whether the central bank
pays interest on base money or only on reserves.

In the model to be analyzed in this paper, the
monetary authority is
viewed as having three
policy tools: the steady state rate of inflation,
a reserve requirement ratio, and the interest rate paid
on bank reserves
(Or reserves plus currency).

The monetary authority is also assumed to

be subservient to the fiscal

authority in that any deficit implied by

the fiscal authority's choice of tax rates and spending level
must be
financed through what can be described as monetary policy
revenue sourc-

es. Because all three policy

instruments affect the revenue generated

by monetary policy, their optimal values must generally be
jointly determined. For example, the
optimal rate of inflation will not be independent of the choice of the

reserve requirement ratio.

This is essentially Pheip's result: if

nondistortionary taxes are available, the optimal tax on outside money
should be zero, and the real after tax return on currency and reserves
should be set equal to ó + n, the after tax return on capital.

With only distortionary taxes, s

0 and tb will generally be nonze-

ro. The optimal value of tb is given by equation (21). The first term
in (21) parallels the standard partial equilibrium result for the opti-

mum commodity tax. In the present case, the optimum tax is inversely
proportional to the own interest rate effect on the demand for base money.

If the cross-elasticities embodied in dr and ka are ignored and

the two rates t and 12 are assumed equal, then (21) can be manipulated
to show that the optimal after tax real return on base money is equal to

[ó(l+S)+flh/{l_5/b,r1 where Cb,r is the elasticity of b with respect to

r. To evaluate this expression, an estimate

C1,r is needed. Since

neither currency nor reserves have recently earned explicit interest in

the U.S., an estimate must be inferred from evidence on the elasticity
of currency and reserves with respect to interest rates on alternative
nonmoney assets.

yielded by currency and deposits. For example, if the rate of inflation

is 0.05 and p equals 0.1, r rises to 0.038. If

-0.012. Since r must exceed -ii, however, this last result suggests that

a corner solution may occur if the optimal value of ir is negative. If a
high rate of deflation is necessary to achieve the

optimal capital-labor

ratio, the real return on base money resulting from the deflation may be

sufficiently large that no explicit interest payments on the monetary
authority's liabilities are necessary.

The effect of the last term in (21), tkka/b, is more difficult to
judge. A portfolio substitutIon argument would suggest that ka

0.

As Stockrnan[198lJ shows, however, an increase in money holdings leads to

a rise in the net of transaction costs return to capital and can lead to

a rise in the capital-labor ratio. A negative value for ka will increase the optimal tb and lower r.

To further consider the possibility of a corner solution in which
(21) would no longer apply, we must examine equation (18), the first order condition for the optimal choice of ir.

OPTIMAL POLICY WITH NO INTEREST PAID ON CURRENCY

- 22

-

The payment of interest on bank reserves is certainly technologically
feasible; tile payment of interest on currency may not be. This section

briefly examines optimal policy when the monetary authority pays inter-

est only on the reserve component of base money.

The results of the

previous section suggested that a corner solution might occur in which

nominal interest is paid on neither reserves nor currency.

In this

case, the restriction the i be paid only on reserves is irrelevant. It
is useful, however, to study the form of the interior solution when in-

terest is paid only on reserves. The failure of currency to earn an explicit rate of interest will tend to increase the demand for bank depos-

its, relative to currency, as a means of

producing liquidity. However,

the extent to which this substitution of

deposits for currency takes

place is dependent on the monetary authority's

setting of its policy in-

struments. The attractiveness of holding money in the form of deposits

rather than currency will depend on both the rate of interest paid on
reserves and the reserve requirement ratio.

In addition, a change in ¶1

now has a direct effect on the real return on currency as well as on the
rate of return on capital.

The first order conditions for the representative individual's maximization problem now take the form, in equilibrium,

is due to the distortions introduced

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

This paper has utilized an optimal taxation framework to
analyze the
choice by the monetary authority of its policy instruments. These instruments, the rate of inflation in the steady state, the interest rate
on reserves and currency, and the reserve requirement ratio on deposits,
all have characteristics in common with commodity taxes. By its choice

of policy instruments, the monetary authority can affect the rJtes of
return on capital, bank deposits, and currency. In general, the optimal

rate of inflation is not independent of the
money or the required reserve ratio.

interest rate paid on base

Unlike previous analyses of the optimal rate of inflation, the model

used in

this

paper assigns distinct roles to explicit interest on base

money and the rate of inflation. The former is set to achieve the opti-

mal opportunity cost of liquidity, while

the latter is used to achieve

the optimal capital-labor ratio. However,

the analysis suggests that

the optimal nominal interest rate on the central bank's liabilities may

be zero. More importantly, any discussion
reserves and currency must take into

of the payment of interest on

account the nature of the tax sys-

tern and the rate of inflation in a nonindexed world.
