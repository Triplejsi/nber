Neighborhood Violence and Urban Youth

NBER Working Paper No. 13773
February 2008

ABSTRACT
Three quarters of American children have been exposed to neighborhood violence in their lifetimes.
Most of the existing research has concluded that exposure to violence leads to restricted emotional
development, aggressive behavior and poor school outcomes. However, this literature fails to account
for the fact that children exposed to neighborhood violence are highly disadvantaged in other ways:
they are more likely to be black, poor and have poorly educated parents. As such, it is not clear whether
exposure to violence or the underlying measures of disadvantage are responsible for the poor child
outcomes observed. Using individual survey data on urban youth and their families from Los Angeles,
we find that the most violent neighborhoods are also characterized by the highest degree of disadvantage:
greatest poverty, highest unemployment, least education. And while living in a violent neighborhood
increases the probability of exposure to violence, within violent neighborhoods those personally exposed
to street violence are significantly more disadvantaged and are more likely to associate with violent
peers than their unexposed neighbors. Once we control for observed and unobserved family disadvantage,
the impact of violence declines for some child outcomes, suggesting that underlying disadvantage
explains some of the negative outcomes observed, but not all - it is still the case that associating with
violent peers is negatively correlated with cognitive test scores. In addition, when we control for underlying
differences across families, the relationship between violence and internalizing behavioral problems
appears stronger.

Introduction
In a 1997 survey nearly three quarters of American children reported having been
exposed to neighborhood violence (Hill and Jones, 1997; Boney-McCoy and Finkelhor,
1997). These rates are highest among low-income urban youth. There have been
numerous studies of the impact of exposure to violence on children that have linked
exposure to violence with restricted emotional development, aggressive behavior,
depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, learning problems and truancy.
However, the existing literature on neighborhood violence is characterized by a
number of shortcomings. In a review of the literature, psychiatrist Joy Osofsky identifies
a number of these shortcomings and calls for future research to address them.1 One
shortcoming relates to the difficulty defining or characterizing neighborhood violence
which leads to significant measurement error. Another is the fact that neighborhood
violence is often correlated with high rates of domestic violence and other types of
disadvantage (racial, income and parental education) which in turn have been shown to
have deleterious effects on child outcomes.2 As such, research documenting a
relationship between neighborhood violence and poor child outcomes may overstate the
relationship.
In this chapter we seek to answer the following questions: 1) In what other ways
do violent neighborhoods differ from non-violent ones? 2) Who is exposed to

Research conducted in the early 1990s concluded that three to ten million children witness assaults against
a parent by an intimate partner each year (Straus, 1992). More recent work has found that violence against
pregnant women (most often perpetrated by an intimate partner) has a negative and significant impact on
birth outcomes which have been linked to worse economic outcomes later in life (Aizer, 2006).

neighborhood violence? Is exposure to violence random? and 3) Does exposure to
violence affect child outcomes or does it reflect other poor circumstances or types of
disadvantage?
This research contributes to the existing body of work on the impact of exposure
to violence on child outcomes by examining this issue with new data that is well-suited to
address many of the shortcomings of the existing work. Importantly, we use established
econometric techniques (referred to as neighborhood and family fixed effects) that allow
one to control for both observed and unobserved measures of neighborhood and family
disadvantage that might be correlated with both exposure to violence and poor child
outcomes, thereby enabling causal inference. The data come from the Los Angeles
Family and Neighborhood Study (LA FANS), an individual survey of children and their
families residing in 65 neighborhoods in Los Angeles, California. The survey contains
information on child and parent characteristics including exposure to violence and
association with violent peers as well as family characteristics and multiple measures of
child well-being. Because all the children in the sample reside in one county, they are
subject to the same macroeconomic conditions and government programs so that we can
implicitly control for differences along these dimensions and focus on the impact of
neighborhood differences on child well-being.
In addition, we utilize alternative measures of community or neighborhood
violence. Typically, measures of neighborhood violence consist of police or crime
reports available only at an aggregate level such as the county or city that is not truly
representative of a child’s neighborhood. In addition, they no not necessarily reflect true
violence or victimization but rather a combination of underlying violence and police

3

response to that violence. Instead, we use two alternative measures of violence designed
to overcome these shortcomings. The first is the rate of hospitalizations for assault
developed from California Hospital Discharge data which is an administrative database
consisting of all hospitalizations in the state. These data allow one to create measures of
violence at the zipcode (which is more local than the county or city) that are not subject
to recall or self-reporting bias and do not reflect policing policies. The second source of
data on neighborhood violence is based on police data for individual reporting districts in
LA City. While these data are generated by the LA Police Department and therefore
reflect both underlying violence and police reports, the data are available at a very fine
level of detail (the census tract) and therefore more closely approximate one’s immediate
neighborhood – even more so than a zipcode.
Combining the individual level data from the LAFANS survey with measures of
neighborhood violence and other neighborhood characteristics from the 2000 Census
yields a dataset with a wide range of information on child, family and neighborhood
characteristics. These data enable one to explore both the effects of exposure to violence
on child well-being and how individual, family and neighborhood characteristics affect
one’s exposure to violence. In addition, we employ econometric techniques, referred to
as “fixed effects,” (described in greater detail later) that allow us to control for underlying
disadvantage at the neighborhood and family level that is unobserved by the researcher.
In so doing, we can isolate the causal impact of exposure to violence, separate from
underlying family and neighborhood disadvantage, on child outcomes. This research will
help us to better understand the role of violence in the lives of disadvantaged children. It
should be stressed that the focus of this work is estimating the impact of intermittent

4

exposure to neighborhood violence on child outcomes. As such, these results are not
generalizable to children who are the victims of repeated victimization such as child
abuse.3

I.

Literature Review

There have been numerous studies of the impact of exposure to violence on children,
with most of the research conducted by psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers.
This research has linked exposure to violence with restricted emotional development,
aggressive behavior, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, learning problems and
truancy.4
The earliest studies focused on single nonrecurring acts of violence such as sniper
shootings in school playgrounds (Pynoos et al, 1987). These studies generally found
posttraumatic stress symptom responses related to internalizing problems (anxiety and
depression) that varied with proximity to the actual violence. However, it has since been
noted that the clinicians in these studies were not blind to the subjects’ exposure to
violence, which some believe may have biased the findings (Cooley-Quille et al, 1995).
More recently, researchers have focused on exposure to chronic community
violence. These studies have, in general, linked exposure to community violence to
externalizing behavioral problems (Bell and Jenkins, 1993). For example, in a study of
37 school children age seven through 12, Cooley-Quille et at (1995) found that exposure

3

For example, recent work by Currie and Tekin (2006) suggests that repeated child abuse and
maltreatment leads to large and significant reductions in child well-being.

Keenan, et al. 1993; Schwab-Stone, Ayers, Kasprow, et al., 1995.

to high levels of community violence was not related to internalizing behavior and
disorders, but was associated with externalizing behavior problems – restlessness, and
impaired social and behavioral functioning. However, the authors also note that “families
of children with high exposure to community violence were characterized by high
conflict and lack of cohesiveness.” This leads the authors to conclude that “An important
caution is needed in interpreting the relationship between exposure to violence and
behavior problems. Because of the study’s correlational nature, it cannot be determined
whether one variable causes the other or whether both are mediated by a third factor.”
In another (larger) survey of 2248 6th, 8th and 10th graders in an urban public
school system, Schwab-Stone et al (1995) find that 40% of youth reported exposure to a
shooting or a stabbing in the past year. Children exposed to high levels of violence were
more likely to be black and/or Latino and more likely to receive free lunch. Using one
way ANOVA to examine differences in child outcomes, they found that violence
exposure was associated with greater willingness to use physical aggression, diminished
perception of risk, lowered personal expectations for the future, dysphoric mood,
antisocial activity, alcohol use and diminished academic achievement. However, in their
discussion, the authors also acknowledge the difficulty establishing a causal relationship,
writing “from the current study one cannot say that violence exposure or feeling unsafe
causes any of the attitudes or aspects of adaptation that are significantly related,
statistically speaking, to them.”
Few economists have studied the impact of exposure to violence on child
outcomes. The little work that does exist explicitly recognizes the difficulty of making
causal inference as exposure to violence may be correlated with other sources of

6

disadvantage that may be responsible for the poor outcomes observed. Grogger (1998)
estimates the impact of school violence on high school graduation rates based on a large
survey of school children and their school administrators. School violence can affect
graduation rates by reducing school attendance and/or the ability to concentrate when in
school, thereby lowering the probability of graduation. A major problem estimating the
impact of school violence on outcomes is that more violent schools may have lower
graduation rates simply because violent students are less likely to complete high school.
Grogger overcomes this problem by focusing on the high school graduation rates of nonviolent students. He finds that higher rates of school violence as reported by principals
among one’s peers was related to lower rates of graduation among the non-violent
students.
But it may still be the case that non-violent children in violent schools differ in
important ways from non-violent children in non-violent schools. Violent schools are
more likely to be in poorer neighborhoods and parents who send their children to violent
schools may suffer from other forms of disadvantage relative to parents who send their
children to non-violent schools. It may be these differences, not differences in school
violence per se, that are responsible for these differences.
More recent work by Kling, Liebman and Katz (2004) and Ludwig, Duncan and
Hirschfield (2001) based on the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) demonstration provides
experimental evidence of the impact of neighborhoods on child well-being. In the MTO
study, poor families were randomly selected to receive subsidies to move to higher
income neighborhoods. The MTO study overcomes previous difficulties estimating the
impact of environment on child well-being – because of the random assignment, families

7

living in poor and non-poor neighborhoods will not differ in significant ways. The
analysis consisted of in-depth interviews with families followed by a quantitative analysis
of how moving to a higher income neighborhood affected child outcomes. In the
qualitative analysis, the authors found that fear of random violence caused parents to
focus much of their time and energy on keeping their children safe and that parental
monitoring declined when they moved to higher income neighborhoods.
In the quantitative analysis that followed, the authors found a positive and
significant impact of moving to a higher income neighborhood on girls but no impact on
boys (Kling and Liebman, 2005). Females experienced improvements in education and
mental health and were less likely to engage in risky behaviors. While the focus of the
MTO study is to evaluate the impact of poor neighborhoods (and not violence
specifically) on child outcomes, the authors find that families that move to higher income
neighborhoods report lower rates of victimization, especially for females, but the
reductions are not statistically significant. There are, however, significant differences
between poor and non-poor neighborhoods in the quality of the school environments, the
presence of adult role models and the health of the environment. Thus while the
qualitative analysis suggested that safety and lack of fear of random violence would
explain improved outcomes associated with moving to a higher income neighborhood,
the quantitative evidence does not appear to support this.
Finally, recent work by Ludwig and Kling (2006) investigates whether the
findings of Ludwig, Duncan, and Hirschfield (2001) that moving to a lower-poverty
neighborhood reduces violent criminal behavior among youths can be explained by
reductions in exposure to criminal activity as measured by neighborhood crime rates.

8

Ludwig and Kling (2006) find no support for the hypothesis that crime is “contagious.”
Rather, they find that neighborhood racial segregation appears to be a much more
important factor than neighborhood crime rates in explaining youth crime. Although the
focus of their work is criminal activity, crime and violence are highly correlated and
these results provide further suggestive evidence that exposure to neighborhood violence
may not have a strong causal impact on youth behavior or outcomes but that the
underlying level of neighborhood disadvantage may be more important.
Thus the existing literature on the impact of violence on child well-being appears
to be mixed. While work by psychiatrists and psychologists has found an association
between exposure to community violence and externalizing behavioral problems, there is
also evidence that children exposed to more community violence are disadvantaged in
other respects – they are poorer, more likely to be Black, and their families suffer from
“lack of cohesiveness.” As such, it is difficult to make causal inferences regarding the
relationship between exposure to violence and child well-being. Work by economists
that has sought to overcome this difficulty through randomized assignment to
neighborhood has found that moving out of poor neighborhoods does improve outcomes
for girls, but cannot attribute the improvements to reductions in violence. In addition,
they have found that the reductions in criminal activity associated with moving to a lower
poverty neighborhood are not attributable to reductions in neighborhood crime but are
more likely explained by improvements in other measures of neighborhood disadvantage
– racial and income segregation (Kling and Ludwig, 2006).
In the work presented here, we attempt to distinguish the impact of violence from
other forms of disadvantage. In other words, we attempt to answer the question: does

9

exposure to community violence cause child outcomes to worsen? Or rather, is it the
case that disadvantaged youth are exposed to more violence, and it is the underlying
disadvantage, not the violence, that is responsible for the worse child outcomes? We
proceed in two stages. First, we include multiple controls for neighborhood and family
disadvantage that are available in the data. Second, we employ neighborhood and family
“fixed effects” which enable us to control for forms of neighborhood and family
disadvantage that may be correlated with exposure to violence but not captured in the
data. This method is described in greater detail in section V.

II. Data
The Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Study (LA FANS)
The LA FANS is a panel study of a representative sample of all neighborhoods in LA.
Poor neighborhoods and children are oversampled and all analyses presented here are
weighted using the survey weights which are deigned to provide estimates generalizable
to the population of all children living in Los Angeles. While the survey is designed as a
panel, only data for the first wave (conducted in 1999-2000) are currently available. In
wave 1, an average of 41 households within each neighborhood were randomly selected
for interview. Sampled adults were asked questions about household economic status,
health insurance, participation in welfare programs, use of social services as well as
questions about their neighborhoods. Caregivers provided information on the home
environment, children’s behavioral problems and school performance. Cognitive
assessments were administered to children over three. Children older than nine were also

10

asked about exposure to violence, their friends and social interaction; as such, the
analysis sample is limited to this older group of 785 children.
To compare the analysis sample with the overall population of children in the US,
we present descriptive statistics for this sample and for the sample of children living in
LA and the nation from the 2000 census in table 1. In column one are the unweighted
means for the LA FANS sample, column two contains the weighted means. In column
three are population means for families with at least one child between the ages of ten
and nineteen in LA county from the 2000 census and in column four are means for the
entire US population of families with at least one child between ten and nineteen.
The children included in this analysis are, on average, 15 years old. Thirty six
percent of mothers are high school dropouts, 67 percent are married and 34 percent live
below poverty. Eleven percent of the mothers receive cash welfare benefits. Given that
the survey was conducted in Los Angeles, it is not surprising that 55 percent are
Hispanic, ten percent Black, 27 percent white and eight percent Asian. If we compare the
raw means in column 1 with the weighted means in column 2, we see that when we
weight the sample means, the children appear slightly less disadvantaged. When we
compare the weighted means to those from the 2000 Census, we conclude that the LA
FANS sample is slightly more disadvantaged relative to the LA county population
(column 3) in terms of race (LA FANS is more likely to include Black and Hispanic
children) as well as poverty (LAFANs includes more poor families and families that rely
on welfare or SSI). However, when we compare the average characteristics of children
sampled in the LA FANS with those in the nation more generally, we find that the LA
FANS children are much more disadvantaged in terms of income, race, and maternal

11

education (column 4). The fact that the analyses are based on a disadvantaged (and nonrepresentative) population of children should be taken into account when interpreting the
results.
Exposure to violence in this sample is somewhat common. Twenty one percent of
children in this sample report having violent peers as measured by whether they know a
gang member (girls are as likely to report violent peers as boys in this sample). As for
exposure to street violence, 11 percent reported being robbed and eight percent witnessed
a shooting in the past year.5

California Hospital Discharge Data
The LA FANS data, which contain the household census tract, are merged with
measures of neighborhood violence developed from California’s hospital discharge
database. The hospital data is available at the zipcode level. As such, for analyses
involving these data, the child’s neighborhood is defined as the zipcode in which he/she
lives. A zipcode(s) is a far more precise measure of one’s neighborhood than measures
typically used (cities or counties) for the purpose of measuring neighborhood violence.
Information on the number of individuals in each zipcode (to compute an assault rate) as
well as characteristics of the zipcode (poverty rate, racial composition, share low skilled,
etc) comes from the 2000 census. There is considerable variation in the number and rate
of admissions for assault across LA’s neighborhoods. For example, in South Central Los
5

Eighteen percent report exposure to family violence, as measured by reports of family members “often
hitting.” However, the characteristics of the families of children who report family violence differ
considerably from the characteristics of violent families reported in other data, suggesting that this measure
may be unreliable in the LAFANS. For this reason, we do not use this measure in the analysis. However,
when we conduct the family fixed effect analysis (described later) we implicitly control for measures of
domestic violence.

12

Angeles there were 501 admissions for assaults among those age 15-44 in 2000 (or 45 per
10,000). In Compton there were 213 admissions (36 per 10,000) and in Beverly Hills
there were 5 (3 per 10,000). 6
The main advantage of using hospital discharge data to calculate measures of
neighborhood violence is that it enables one to calculate much more local measures than
other datasets and does not rely on self-reports or police reports.7 In addition, the
measures can be broken down by race and whether the violence involved a gun. But
there are potential drawbacks to these data. First, they capture extreme acts of violence
(though they are likely highly correlated with less severe violence). Second, because
they are based on hospital utilization, they may capture violence perpetrated against those
most likely to rely on hospitals as a source of medical care (those with fewer resources or
those located closest to hospitals). However, the measure is based only on admission to
the hospital, not emergency department utilization, and as there is less discretion in
hospital admission, we believe that the potential for this measure to capture poverty is
minimal and that it fairly accurately captures neighborhood violence. But in a
conservative effort to limit any potential for bias we recalculate our measure of
neighborhood violence not as a rate of assaults, but as the share of all hospitalizations for
an injury that are due to assaults. The latter implicitly controls for greater reliance on
hospitals for care in some zipcodes relative to others.

6

South Central includes zipcodes 90001, 90002, 90003, 90047 and 90059; Compton 90220, 90221 and
90222; and Beverly Hills includes zipcodes 90210,90211, and 90212.
7
Calculations by the author based on the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) of 2004 reveal that
the vast majority of violent crime occurs near the victim’s home. For example, among those age 12-19
who were victim of an assault, 15 percent reported that the assault happened in or very near the home, 47.7
percent reported that it happened within 1 mile, and 76.2 percent reported that it occurred within five miles.
This suggests that assault rates calculated from hospital discharge data that identify the patient’s zipcode of
residence do accurately reflect violence in the zipcode.

13

Violent Crime by Census Tract for LA City
We can link information on violent crime by census tract (a smaller area than zipcode) to
the roughly 475 youth surveyed as part of the LAFANS and who reside in LA City (a
subset of LA County). These data were first compiled by Grogger (2002)8. As noted
previously, while these data are based on police reports and thus capture not only
violence but reports to the police, they are available at the finest level of detail possible –
the census tract which includes on average 5,800 individuals in LA county, as opposed to
a zipcode which includes on average 67,000 individuals. These data are not available by
race or age. Rates of violent crime for the year 1999 range from 0 to 1910 per 10,000,
with an average of 136, which is considerably lower than it was in the early 1990s. In
1992, the first year for which these data are available, the average rate of violent crime
per census tract in LA was 275 per 10,000, representing a 50 percent decline in violent
crime over an eight year period.
The next three sections contain our analysis of the role of violence in the lives of
urban youth. In the next section (section III), we seek to answer the first of the three
questions: 1) in what other ways do violent neighborhoods differ from non-violent ones?
In section IV, we answer the second set of questions: who is exposed to neighborhood
violent? Is exposure to violent random or correlated with other forms of family
disadvantage? Finally, in section V, we answer the last of our three questions, does
exposure to violence affect child outcomes or does it reflect other poor circumstances or
types of disadvantage?

III. How do violent neighborhoods differ from non-violent ones?
8

The data were subsequently updated by George Tita.

14

Our first measure of neighborhood violence is the share of all hospitalizations for an
injury in a zipcode that are the result of an assault. This measure should reduce, if not
eliminate, any bias in the measures of violence that derives from one group’s greater
reliance on hospitals for care.9 We also decompose the assault rate into gun and non-gun
assaults.
In Figure 1 we present graphic evidence of a relationship between this measure of
community violence and various community characteristics. As is evident from all
graphs, there is a positive correlation between neighborhood violence among youths
(those aged 15-19) and neighborhood measures of disadvantage. Zipcodes with higher
levels of violence have a greater share of high school drop outs, individuals below
poverty, households receiving welfare, black individuals and a higher unemployment
rate. These relationships persist for adults (age 25-44) as well.
The two most important predictors of violence are the share below poverty and
the share black in a neighborhood. Among youths, if the share below poverty increases
by a standard deviation (.104) then the assault rate (as a ratio) increases 15 percent of a
standard deviation. If the share black increases by a standard deviation, then violence
increases by 28 percent of a standard deviation. Among adults, poverty appears to have a
greater impact than race in predicting violence.
In Figures 2A and 2B are the rates decomposed into gun-related assaults and non
gun-related assaults, respectively. In Los Angeles, among those age 15-19, gun violence
is responsible for a large share of hospital admissions: 12 percent of all hospital
admissions for an injury and 61 percent of all hospital admissions for an assault. As is
evident from Figures 2A and 2B, the relationship between violence and neighborhood
9

Results based on the assault rate are very similar but tend to yield more “outlier” observations.

15

disadvantage is driven almost entirely by gun violence, and, as with the total assault rate,
the share below poverty and the share black appear to be the most important predictors of
neighborhood violence.
In Figure 3 we present results from a similar exercise based on census tracts in
LA City. The findings are similar: race (share black) is highly correlated with violent
crime at the census tract level, as are the share receiving welfare and the share below
poverty. Unlike the hospitalization data, the crime data do not allow us to look at gun vs
non-gun crimes or differences by age.
Overall, this preliminary analysis based on aggregate data suggests that
community violence (and gun violence, in particular) is correlated with multiple
measures of disadvantage. This will affect our ability to attribute any negative
relationship that we observe between violence and child well-being to violence and not
the underlying disadvantage without adequately controlling for underlying sources of
disadvantage.

IV. Who is exposed to violence? Are children from disadvantaged families exposed
to more violence?
What determines personal exposure to violence? Is living in a violent neighborhood the
most important factor? How much do family characteristics matter? We begin to answer
these questions by comparing hospitalization rates across races and age groups. In Table
2 we see that hospitalization for assault is more common among youths age 15-19 than
adults (age 25-44) and children (age 0-15, not shown). The decline in violence by age is
even more striking when we focus on gun violence (column 3). In addition, blacks have
much higher rates of assault than other groups: nearly 4 per 1000 compared to .5 per

16

1000 for whites and 1.4 for Hispanics. This is particularly true for gun assaults (column
3). But the higher rates for blacks reflect, in part, their greater reliance on hospitals for
care. In column 2 of Table 2 we present the share of all hospitalizations for an injury that
are the result of an assault and in columns 4 and 5 the share of all hospitals for an assault
and any injury that are the results of a gun assault, respectively. When we correct for the
greater reliance on hospitals for care among some groups, we find that blacks still have
the highest rate of assault (42 percent of all injuries are assaults as opposed to 8 percent
for whites) but the gap is somewhat smaller. Interestingly, racial differences in assault
rates are greater for youths than adults.
We follow the analysis based on aggregate data with an analysis of personal
exposure to violence as reported in the LAFANS survey. In Table 3 we present the
probabilities of exposure to different types of violence by neighborhood type (Columns
1-2). Personal exposure to violence consists of exposure to violent peers and exposure to
street violence. The former is defined as whether the child knows any gang members and
the latter is defined in one of two ways – whether the person witnessed a shooting or was
robbed in the past year.
A violent neighborhood is defined as one in the top one third of the distribution of
violence as measured by the hospitalization rate for assault and a non-violent
neighborhood is in the bottom third of the distribution of violence. Living in a violent
neighborhood increases one’s exposure to violence: those in violent neighborhoods are
more likely to know a gang member, witness a shooting or be robbed. However, certain
parental characteristics are just as important in determining exposure to violence. For
example, whether a child’s mother often knows his or her whereabouts is just as

17

predictive of exposure to violence as a violent neighborhood (columns 3 and 4). In other
words, watchful parents appear to be just as protective as safe neighborhoods. A more
formal decomposition of the effects of family versus neighborhood on exposure to
violence suggests that family characteristics explain more of the variation in exposure to
violence than do neighborhood characteristics, the degree of difference depends on the
measure of violence. For example, neighborhood characteristics explain less than 13
percent of the variation in violence as measured by whether the child knows a gang
member and family characteristics explain slightly more than 15 percent. For witnessing
a shooting, the difference is much greater: neighborhood characteristics explain 12
percent while family characteristics explain 36 percent. For being robbed, family (5
percent) and neighborhood (1.8 percent) characteristics appear to explain much less of
the variation.
There is also considerable overlap in the types of violence to which children in
this sample are exposed. Of the children who report knowing someone in a gang, 16.36
percent of them were also robbed, 20.12 percent witnessed a shooting and 28.48 percent
reported that family members “often hit.” Likewise for those who witness a shooting,
33.85 report being robbed and 50 percent know someone in a gang and for those who
have been robbed, 25 percent witnessed a shooting and 31 percent knew someone in a
gang (Table 4).
In table 5 we present evidence that the family characteristics of those exposed to
violence are significantly different from those not exposed. The table includes three
panels. The first is based on the full sample, the second and third are based on nonviolent and violent neighborhoods, respectively. We find important differences in the

18

family background characteristics of those who are exposed to violence in this sample,
even when we control for the underlying level of neighborhood violence as we implicitly
do in panels two and three. Those personally exposed to violence are more
disadvantaged than those who are not, even conditional on the level of neighborhood
violence. The largest differences are observed for those who witnessed a shooting
(versus those who did not) and those who know gang members. We find considerably
smaller differences for those who were robbed versus those who were not which may
suggest that of the measures of violence considered here, being robbed may be the least
reflective of family disadvantage and may include a greater random or exogenous
component than the other measures.
These descriptive analyses yield a number of interesting findings with respect to
the role of violence in the lives of urban youth. First, violent neighborhoods are
correlated with higher exposure to violence, but families living in violent neighborhoods
are poorer, less educated and more likely to be Black or Hispanic than those living in
non-violent neighborhoods. Second, violence does not appear to be random. Children
exposed to street violence (shootings and robbery) often associate with violent peers. In
addition, even within violent neighborhoods, only some children report personal exposure
to violence and those who do are more disadvantaged than those who do not. Together
this preliminary evidence suggests that other forms of disadvantage, not simply
neighborhood violence, may be responsible for the negative child outcomes associated
with exposure to violence.
In order to determine whether it is exposure to violence itself or other
characteristics that are correlated with violence and child outcomes, we must control for

19

the underlying level of disadvantage as well as possible. For this we turn to regression
analysis in the next section.

V. Does exposure to neighborhood violence affect child outcomes?
We pursue two empirical estimation strategies in order to determine whether it is
exposure to violence that negatively affects child well-being or whether other types of
disadvantage (income, educational, racial) which may be correlated with violence that
affect child outcomes. In the first, we conduct ordinary least squares (OLS) regression
analysis of the impact of violence on child outcomes with and without controlling for
other types of disadvantage. The first equation estimated is:

Y= β0 + β1Violence + ε

(1A)

where Y is cognitive test scores for reading comprehension and math. The cognitive test
scores are a percentile (0-100), normed against other children of the same age and sex.
We focus on cognitive test scores because they are objective measures of child cognitive
achievement which have been shown to significantly affect a child’s future economic
success (Currie and Thomas, 2001, Zax and Rees, 2001, Murname et al, 2005). Previous
studies of the impact of violence on child outcomes have examined cognitive scores,
GPAs, psychological evaluations and the Behavior Problems Index (BPI). We also look
at the impact of violence on the BPI. However, both GPA and BPI have strong
subjective components which can bias these measures, whereas cognitive test scores
suffer no such bias.

20

Violence in the above equation is one of five measures of violence. The first and
second are measures of neighborhood violence - the rate of assaults among those aged
15-19 (or the ratio, as defined previously) in the neighborhood (zipcode) in which the
child lives and the level of violent crime in the census tract.10 The third is peer violence
which is defined as whether the child knows any gang members. The fourth and fifth
measures of violence in the above equation are defined in one of two ways – whether the
person witnessed a shooting or was robbed in the past year. The error term ε includes all
child, family and neighborhood characteristics not included in the regression that
influence child outcomes. Finally, we redefine neighborhood violence as the natural log
of the violent crime rate in the census tract.
In the top panel of Table 6A are regression estimates of the impact of violence
(neighborhood, peer violence, and street violence) on child outcomes without any
additional controls (equation 1A). It appears that neighborhood violence, as measured by
the rate of hospitalizations for assaults, has a large negative and significant impact on
both reading and math test scores, (columns 1 and 2). If the level of violence in one’s
neighborhood were to increase by one standard deviation (13 assaults per 10,000), then
reading and math scores would decline by 7 and 6 points respectively (or 23 and 22
percent of a standard deviation). Violent neighborhoods are also associated with both
internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems (columns 3 and 4). Internalizing
behavioral problems refer to all problems that are directed inwardly. They include low or
restricted activity levels, being shy, timid and unassertive, withdrawing from social

10

The census tract of children in the LAFANS is known and matched to the corresponding zipcode. Of the
89 census tracts in the LAFANS, 58 matched to only one zipcode and 31 matched to two or three zipcodes.
For children in census tracts with more than one zipcode, the average assault rate across all zipcodes that
comprise the census tract was used.

21

situation and acting in a fearful manner. The BPI (internalizing index) ranges from zero
to 20, with a mean and standard deviation of 3. Externalizing behavioral problems
include such behaviors as aggression, delinquency and hyperactivity. The BPI
externalizing index ranges from zero to 31, with a mean and standard deviation of 6. A
standard deviation increase in neighborhood violence is associated with a half point
increase in both the internalizing and externalizing BPI, or 17 and 8 percent of a standard
deviation increase, respectively.
Personal exposure to violence is also associated with worse test scores and greater
behavioral problems. Association with violent peers (columns 5 and 6) results in an 11
and 16 point drop in reading and math scores, respectively (37 and 54 percent of a
standard deviation) and a one point and three point increase in internalizing and
externalizing behavioral problems, respectively (30 percent and 50 percent of a standard
deviation). Witnessing a shooting is associated with 16 and 18 point drops in test scores
(49 and 61 percent of a standard deviation), and with a 45 and 55 percent standard
deviation increase in internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems. Finally, being
robbed in the past year is associated with 10 and 6 point drops (35 and 23 percent of a
standard deviation, respectively) in reading and math, and a small insignificant increase
in internalizing behaviors and a small (15 percent of a standard deviation), but significant
increase in externalizing behaviors.
However, these estimates may be biased. Recall that n equation (1A) estimated
above, the error term ε includes all child, family and neighborhood characteristics not
included in the regression that influence child outcomes. These include all other types of
disadvantage (racial, income, etc). If these omitted variables are correlated with violence,

22

(that is, if otherwise disadvantaged children are also exposed to more violence) then our
estimate of β1 will suffer from omitted variable bias – capturing not only the impact of
violence on child outcomes, but also other types of disadvantage that can negatively
affect child outcomes independent of violence. The bias in most cases will likely be
upward if violence and disadvantage are positive correlated and child outcomes are
negatively correlated with disadvantage. An upward bias means that our estimate of β1
will be an overestimate of the true impact of violence on child well being. It is possible,
however, for our estimate of β1 to be an under-estimate of the impact of violence on child
outcomes if either disadvantage is positively correlated with child outcomes and exposure
to violence or disadvantage is negatively correlated with both child outcomes and
exposure to violence. There is evidence, for example, that poor and minority families
under-report their children’s behavioral problems so that disadvantage and child
outcomes are positively correlated for behavioral problems (Lambert et al, 1992 and
McMiller and Weisz, 1996). It might also be the case that children in the most
disadvantaged families are less likely to report exposure to violence if it might implicate
them in criminal activity (such as knowing a gang member).
To correct for this bias, we include many detailed controls for locational, racial,
income, and parental education disadvantage. As we control for these variables, the
estimate of β1 should decrease in magnitude. The second regression is:

Y= β0 + β1Violence + β2Child + β3Family + β4Neighborhood + ε

23

(1B)

Where Child refers to a vector of child characteristics (sex, age, race and number of
siblings) and Family refers to a vector of family characteristics which include income and
parental education disadvantage (maternal education, maternal age, marital status, family
earnings and welfare receipt). Neighborhood refers to a vector of neighborhood
characteristics (share receiving welfare, share below poverty, share with less than a high
school degree, the unemployment rate and the share black) defined at the neighborhood
level (either the zipcode or the census tract, depending on the analysis) and based on data
from the 2000 census.
Estimates of equation 1B are presented in panel 2 of Table 6A. The following
neighborhood (zipcode level) controls are included: share on welfare, share below
poverty, share with less than a high school degree, the unemployment rate and the share
black. When we include these controls for other neighborhood characteristics, many of
the previous estimates of the impact of violence on child outcomes fall considerably. The
impact of neighborhood violence falls by more than 80 percent for math and reading
scores and is no longer significant. The impact of neighborhood violence on behavioral
problems also falls and is no longer statistically significantly different from zero. The
impact of peer violence and witnessing a shooting on cognitive test scores and behavioral
problems both fall by approximately 30 percent. The impact of being robbed, however,
falls the least once we control for neighborhood characteristics, falling only between 10
and 15 percent.
In the third panel, we include controls for neighborhood and family
characteristics. When we do, the impact of peer violence on cognitive performance and
behavioral problems falls further still and remains significant for externalizing behavioral

24

problems and math scores only. The impact of witnessing a shooting on all but
externalizing behavioral problems falls and is no longer statistically significantly
different from zero. Interestingly, the impact of being robbed in the past year on child
scores changes very little when we control for family characteristics and is still
significantly negatively associated with child test scores in reading and math.
In Table 6B we present estimated regression coefficients for the full set of family
and neighborhood controls from the previous regression. Of the neighborhood
characteristics included, only the share of adults with less than a high school degree
appears to largely, significantly and negatively affect child outcomes. However, it could
be that we are simply not including the most important neighborhood characteristics
because they are intangible or unobservable to the researcher, a point to which we return.
As for personal or family characteristics, race (being Black or Hispanic), maternal
education, family earnings and welfare receipt have the largest effects on child outcomes.
But these estimates are still subject to the criticism that many important forms of
neighborhood disadvantage are not captured in the data. If true, then our estimates of β1
may still be biased. To address this, we include neighborhood fixed effects. The
inclusion of fixed effects defined at the neighborhood level essentially limits our analysis
to a comparison of children who have been exposed to violence with children who have
not been exposed and reside in the same neighborhood. In so doing, we implicitly
control for all sources of neighborhood disadvantage, observed or unobserved, that might
be correlated with exposure to violence and could bias our results.
Panel four includes family controls and neighborhood (zipcode) fixed effects. By
including zipcode fixed effects we are able to isolate the impact of exposure to violence

25

separate from other forms of neighborhood disadvantage. When we do, the impact of
violent peers on reading scores falls further still, while the impact on math score also falls
but is still significant (5.8 points) as does the impact on externalizing behavioral
problems. Again, the inclusion of these controls does not affect the impact of being
robbed on child test scores which is still negative and significant (10.2 and 5.4 points on
reading and math, respectively) and the null effect on behavioral problems remains.
We re-estimate the regressions presented in Table 6A re-defining the
neighborhood at the census tract and the measure of neighborhood violence as the nature
log of the violent crime rate. We do this because, as noted previously, the crime rate is
available at a considerably smaller area (census tract) than the zipcode which may better
approximate a neighborhood. Note that since the violent crime data at the level for the
census tract is available only for Los Angeles City (and not all of Los Angeles County),
the sample size available for these analyses is smaller (approximately 500 versus 800).
When we exclude all controls (top panel of Table 6C) we see that the violent crime rate
has a negative and significant impact on all child outcomes, though the effect is not very
large. For example, a 100% drop in violent crime would raise reading scores by 16
points (slightly more than a standard deviation). As we include neighborhood and family
controls (second and third panels), the point estimates decrease considerably and lose
significance, just as we observed for the zipcode-level regressions. The remaining
columns (columns 4 -15) present estimates of the impact of personal exposure to violence
on child outcomes with controls for neighborhood characteristics defined at the smaller
geographic level (census tract). In the last panel, we include neighborhood (census tract)

26

fixed effects. In general, the results are very similar to those in which neighborhood is
defined at the larger level of the zipcode.
The results from the above regressions suggest that once we control for other
forms of disadvantage, violent neighborhoods, violent peers and witnessing a shooting do
not significantly negatively affect child cognitive achievement or internalizing behavioral
problems – suggesting that underlying sources of disadvantage associated with both
exposure to violence and child outcomes are likely responsible for the poor outcomes
observed. They do seem to be correlated with externalizing behavior problems. The fact
that the estimated impact of these types of violence on child outcomes falls as more child,
family and neighborhood controls are included underscores the importance of controlling
for underlying disadvantage that may be correlated with both exposure to violence and
child outcomes to produce unbiased estimates.
In contrast, the negative impact of one measure of violence (being robbed in the
past year) on child test scores remains once we control for neighborhood and family
characteristics, though there do not appear to be any significant effects on behavioral
problems. It could be that we are not adequately controlling for differences across
families within neighborhoods that are correlated with both exposure to violence and
poor child outcomes. Recall from Table 5 that the observed family characteristics of
those who were robbed were very different from those who were not, even when limiting
the comparison to families in violent neighborhoods. If families differ in observed ways,
they may also differ in unobserved ways for which we cannot control and which may
continue to bias our estimates. An important example may be domestic violence – as
noted previously, children in disadvantaged families are more likely to witness domestic

27

violence which may also be correlated with exposure to street violence. Since the LA
FANS does not contain credible measures of domestic violence, we are not able to
control for this directly.
To address this concern, we present estimates of the impact of exposure to
violence on child outcomes including family fixed effects in Table 7. By including
family fixed effects we limit our analysis to a comparison to children who have been
exposed to violence with their siblings who have not been exposed, thereby implicitly
controlling for all measures of family disadvantage, both observed and unobserved, that
may be correlated with worse child outcomes and exposure to violence. This would
include, for example, exposure to domestic violence. An analysis that includes family
fixed effects must, by definition, include only those children in families with at least two
children included in the LA FANS survey. This limits our sample to roughly 575
children in the case of violent peers, and 375 for the two other measures of exposure to
violence (witness a shooting or being robbed last year). Because the sample has changed,
for purposes of comparison in the top panel of Table 7 we present OLS estimates of the
impact of exposure to violence on child outcomes including family controls and
neighborhood fixed effects but not family fixed effects and in the bottom panel we
include family fixed effects. When we include family fixed effects in the last panel the
large and significant effects of being robbed on reading and math scores are close to zero
and no longer significant. However, those who know someone in a gang still have lower
reading scores (8 points or 60 percent of a standard deviation). One concern over
interpreting this latter estimate as causal, however, is that those of lower cognitive ability
may choose to associate with violent appears. While the family fixed effect estimate

28

does partially address this concern because cognitive ability within families is highly
correlated (and much more so than across families), differences in cognitive ability across
siblings still exist and may drive this relationship.
Interestingly, the impact of all three measures of violence on internalizing
behavioral problems increases and becomes borderline significant when family fixed
effects are included. The point estimates of 1.23, 1.99 and 1.50 suggest that exposure to
violence increases the BPI by half a standard deviation. This is an interesting finding that
may be explained by the fact that the BPI is based on parent reports and parents in
disadvantaged families may be less likely to report behavior as problematic. For
example, in the LAFANS, the average internalizing BPI of black children is 2.84
compared with 3.17 for non-black children (the numbers are 6.1 and 7.7 for the
externalizing BPI score). This is consistent with the findings of others (see Spencer et al,
2005 and Ng, 2006) based on other larger data sets. As such, when we limit our
comparison to that between siblings within the same family, we eliminate the familybased reporting bias that can bias downwards our estimates of the impact of exposure to
violence on children’s internalizing behavioral problems.

VI. Conclusion
Together these results suggest that care should be taken in interpreting estimates
of the impact of exposure to neighborhood violence on child outcomes. Previous work
has found that exposure to violence is associated with many negative child outcomes
(both cognitive and behavioral) but much of this work, while acknowledging that
children exposed to violence are often more disadvantaged in other ways, rarely controls

29

for such differences. Without controlling for such differences estimates of the impact of
exposure to violence on child outcomes are likely biased – reflecting the impact of both
exposure to violence and underlying neighborhood and family disadvantage on child
outcomes. In the work presented here we employ econometric strategies to control for
such differences by including multiple measures of neighborhood and family
disadvantage as covariates. We also include neighborhood and family fixed effects
which control for both observed and unobserved characteristics of a child’s neighborhood
and family that might bias estimates of the impact of violence on child outcomes.
Once we control for underlying disadvantage, the impact of violence declines for
some child outcomes, suggesting that underlying disadvantage does explain some of the
negative outcomes observed, but not all. In fact, for internalizing behavior problems,
controlling for underlying differences across families actually tends to increase the
impact of all three measures violence. And it is still the case that even when we control
for observed and unobserved underlying disadvantage, having violent peers (knowing a
gang member) is negatively correlated with cognitive test scores.
These findings have implications for public policies regarding the reduction of
violence as well as housing for the poor. In particular, the evidence presented here
suggests that reducing neighborhood violence via enhanced law enforcement policies
without reducing other sources of neighborhood disadvantage may have a limited impact
on the youth outcomes examined here. Housing policies, and in particular, housing
subsidies that enable low-income families to move to less disadvantaged neighborhoods,
may be more effective in this regard, especially if they improve the personal
circumstances (ie employment and income) of the target families. In this respect, policies

30

aimed directly at lessening the income and educational disadvantages of families may
prove the most effective.
