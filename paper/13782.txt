Evidence of Differences in the Effectiveness of Safety-Net Management in European Union
Countries

NBER Working Paper No. 13782
February 2008
JEL No. F02
ABSTRACT
EU financial safety nets are social contracts that assign uncertain benefits and burdens to taxpayers
in different member countries. To help national officials to assess their taxpayers' exposures to loss
from partner countries, this paper develops a way to estimate how well markets and regulators in 14
of the EU-15 countries have controlled deposit-institution risk-shifting in recent years. Our method
traverses two steps. The first step estimates leverage, return volatility, and safety-net benefits for individual
EU financial institutions. For stockholder-owned banks, input data feature 1993-2004 data on stock-market
capitalization. Parallel accounting values are used to calculate enterprise value (albeit less precisely)
for mutual savings institutions. The second step uses the output from the first step as input into regression
models of safety-net benefits and interprets the results. Parameters of the second-step models express
differences in the magnitude of safety-net subsidies and in the ability of financial markets and regulators
in member countries to restrain the flow of safety-net subsidies to commercial banks and savings institutions.
We conclude by showing that banks from high-subsidy and low-restraint countries have initiated and
received the lion's share of cross-border M&A activity. The efficiency, stabilization, and distributional
effects of allowing banks to and from differently subsidized environments to expand their operations
in partner countries pose policy issues that the EU ought to address.

EVIDENCE OF DIFFERENCES IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SAFETY-NET
MANAGEMENT IN EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES
In individual countries, banking insolvencies trace to difficulties in constraining the
extent and character of risk-taking and risk-shifting by banks. Risk-shifting occurs when
particular bank stakeholders are not adequately compensated for the risks to which they are
exposed.
EU directives and Basel agreements divide cross-country accountability for preventing
and resolving bank insolvencies in an economically arbitrary way. If a multinational European
bank were to fail, the EU’s 1994 Directive on Deposit-Guarantee Schemes makes host countries
responsible for paying off at least the domestic depositors of any banking offices the failed
organization might have operated in their jurisdiction1.
Although the host country is charged with supervising banking entities that operate
within its borders, Basel arrangements make home-country officials responsible for supervising
the accounts of the consolidated multinational organization to which a host-country subsidiary
would report. This gives regulators in both countries authority to influence loss exposures and
insolvency resolution at host-country banks. Losses large enough to ruin a host-country
subsidiary might be dumped on it by a wily offshore parent or a slippery host-country subsidiary
might avoid ruin by hiding its losses in assets it manages to transfer to the home country at an
inflated value. Unfair though it might be, cross-country differences in bankruptcy procedures and
in the effectiveness of market and regulatory discipline exerted in different jurisdictions could

countries.

force taxpayers of a home or host country to shoulder the bill for negligent acts of safety-net
officials, auditors, or creditors in a partner country (Eisenbeis, 2004 and 2006; Eisenbeis and
Kaufman, 2006).
This paper develops a way for EU regulators to assess their taxpayers’ exposures to loss
from partner countries. Our method estimates how well, on average, markets and regulators in
individual countries manage to control deposit-institution risk-shifting during a specified time
period. Sections I and II explain that our procedure combines two steps. We first construct time
series for leverage, return volatility, and safety-net benefits at individual EU financial
institutions. For stockholder-owned banks, our calculations use 1993-2004 data on stock-market
capitalization. In generating these data for mutual institutions, we draw on less frequently
reported accounting values to construct (albeit less precisely) these same three time series.
Section III takes the second step, feeding the first-step estimates as input into regression
models of ex ante safety-net benefits and interpreting the results. We show that parameters of the
second-step models express differences in the magnitude of safety-net subsidies and in the ability
of financial markets and regulators in member countries to restrain the flow of safety-net
subsidies to commercial banks and savings institutions. The final section shows that our
estimates help to predict cross-border merger activity among banks. It argues that it is poor
policy for the EU to allow banks to merge into and out of differently subsidized and differently
controlled environments without explicitly considering the efficiency, stabilization, and
distributional effects that such mergers might unleash.

I. Risk-Shifting Opportunities Provided by the Safety Nets

3

It is instructive to conceive of a country’s financial safety net as an evolving and
purposively incomplete contract whose counterparties are major sectors of that country’s
economy. This contract has two dimensions. First, it allocates de facto responsibility for
controlling bank risk-taking and recapitalizing insolvent institutions to specific regulators and
bank stakeholders. Second, to alleviate customer losses in economically and politically arduous
circumstances, it authorizes government officials to assign to taxpayers some of the costs of
resolving bank insolvencies that supervisory pressure and market discipline fail to prevent.
Financial safety nets expand risk-shifting opportunities by reducing incentives for
depositors and other private counterparties to monitor and police risk taking by banks. The costs
and benefits a country receives from its safety net depend on how much market discipline the net
displaces and how successfully safety-net managers substitute explicit and implicit insurance
premiums and takeover threats for the credit-market discipline they displace.
All EU safety nets include depositor guarantees. By exerting lobby pressure, a country’s
banking industry can and (we find) do keep these guarantees from being fully priced. The result
is that an increase in a bank’s overall risk exposure can almost always increase the value of the
safety-net benefits it receives. This creates an incentive to search out and to exploit weaknesses
in risk-control arrangements. At the same time, takeover threats exerted by safety-net managers
make it uneconomic to maximize the value of current-period benefits. The result is that bankers
support their risk-taking partly – but only partly – with off-balance sheet risk capital that they
extract strategically via the safety net from taxpayers and less-adventurous banks (Kane, 1995;
Honohan and Klingebiel, 2002).
Merton (1974) models the equity of a firm as a call option on the firm’s assets whose
exercise price is the book value of creditor claims (B). When B exceeds the value of bank assets,

4

creditors absorb the difference. Safety-net support allows creditors to put some or all of their
losses to safety-net managers. This reduces the net default risk that markets for equity and debt
must price (Vallilou and Xing, 2004).
The per-period flow of safety-net benefits that bank stockholders enjoy can be defined as
a “fair” insurance premium (IPP) expressed per euro of a bank’s deposits. Merton (1977, 1978)
shows that the IPP increases both with a bank’s leverage and with the volatility of its returns. In
Merton’s one-period model, leverage is measured as the ratio of the market value (D) of deposits
and other debt to the market value of a bank’s assets (V). Volatility is defined as the standard
deviation of the return on bank assets (σV). Our first-round estimates replace D with its book
value (B) and our second-round models parsimoniously linearize the IPP as:
IPP = γ0 + γ1σV + γ2(B/V) + ε1.2

(1)

This formulation implies that, other things equal, the value of safety-net benefits increases in
both σV and B/V. By themselves, the positive partial derivatives γ 1 = ∂IPP ∂σ V and

γ 2 = ∂IPP ∂ ( B / V ) in (1) tell us how much incremental value bank stockholders might extract
from the safety net by increasing the associated form of risk-taking.
The benchmark single-equation model (1) does not explicitly recognize that debt and
deposit-insurance contracts convey covenant-like monitoring and loss-control powers to
creditors and safety-net managers that empower them to restrain risk-shifting directly (Kane,
1995). To analyze the risk-shifting process at individual countries and banks, we estimate a
version of the two-equation model pioneered by Duan, Moreau, and Sealey (1992). To address
whether and how well safety-net covenants constrain bank-risk-shifting incentives, Duan et al.
introduce into the Merton model a structural equation for the debt-to-asset ratio, B/V:
2

Because the implicit Taylor-series expansion occurs around positive IPP mean values in each country, the zero
lower bound on IPP is not a worrisome source of bias.

5

B/V = α0 + α1σV + ε2.

(2)

Equation (2) is a locus of potential market-equilibrium points that expresses a tradeoff between
the pursuit of current safety-net benefits and the bank’s exposure to takeover by creditors or
insurers. Substituting (2) into (1) produces the following (partially) reduced-form equation:
IPP = β0 + β1σV + ε3,

(3)

where ε3=ε1+ γ2ε2. Even though it is convenient to estimate (2) and (3) separately, an underlying
recursive structure links the two equations:

d (B / V )
,
dσ V

(4)

∂IPP
∂IPP
+
α 1 = γ 1 + γ 2α 1 .
∂σ V ∂ ( B / V )

(5)

α1 ≡

β1 ≡

In portraying volatility as an exogenous variable, the model assumes that σ V represents a
value-maximizing decision made in response to a vector of unobserved bank-specific profit
generators. The underlying intuition is that of a dynamic rational-expectations game: each bank
sets its leverage and asset volatility jointly, with the understanding that creditors and safety-net
managers monitor these values and restrain leverage by raising funding costs and standing ready
to take over the franchise in the event of insolvency. In turn, creditors and regulators expect
banks to react ex ante and ex post to the discipline they provide. Equation (2) expresses the
hypothesis that, in equilibrium, outside monitoring constrains banks to choose points that lie on a
locus of mutually acceptable leverage and volatility pairs.
Given the external discipline a bank faces, the sign of β1 in equations (3) and (5) indicates
whether a bank’s covenanted contracting environment allows increases in asset volatility to
increase the multiperiod value of its safety-net guarantees. In principle, the total derivative β1
incorporates the value of the opportunity to operate the bank in future periods (Ritchken,
6

Thomson, and DeGennaro, 1993). If β1 is nonpositive, risk-shifting incentives in a given country
are fully neutralized.
To constrain risk-taking at all, outside limitations on leverage must be risk-sensitive
enough to overcome the “inside” value of leverage to bank stockholders so as to establish a
negatively sloped locus of acceptable B/V and σV values. However, a negative α1 only implies
that risk-sensitive capital regulation and complementary takeover and market discipline partially
constrain realizable safety-net benefits. As an input into β1 in equation (5), the size of α1 tells us
whether at the margin outside discipline is potent enough to persuade the bank not to increase
return volatility when outside capital requirements increase. To neutralize risk-shifting incentives
at the margin, outside pressure must induce a decline in B/V large enough to offset the currentperiod increase in IPP a higher σV would otherwise generate.
Thus, for market and regulatory pressure consistently to discipline -- and potentially to
neutralize -- incremental risk-shifting incentives, two conditions must be met:
Capital must increase with volatility:

α1 < 0,

Guarantee value must not rise with volatility:

β1 ≤ 0.

Although the values of assets, guarantees, and volatility are imbedded in a bank’s stock price,
none of these variables is directly observable. However, Marcus and Shaked (1984) show that
we can use option-based numerical expressions for the value of deposit insurance to track these
variables synthetically. Because finance theory tends to focus on unobservable values, running
regressions on synthetic data sets is a common practice in finance. This two-step approach tests
substantive hypotheses about asset valuation jointly with the subsidiary hypothesis that the
synthetic observations are reliable estimates of the true variables.

7

Every model makes deliberate and hard-to-defend simplifications. In interpreting our
parsimonious regression experiments, we cannot rule out the possibility that omitted variables,
measurement error, and simultaneous-equation bias distort the outcomes in unknown ways.
Murphy and Topel (1985) show that standard errors of substantive parameters are often
underestimated in two-step tests. These considerations suggest that we should interpret t-values
conservatively and subject our results to robustness checks.
The first step in the Marcus-Shaked procedure is to generate tracking values for V and σV
by numerical methods. These values are then used to estimate IPP as the value of a put option on
bank assets. The procedure begins by solving the call-option formula for equity, E.3 The last step
uses Îto’s lemma to link σV to E, V and σE (the instantaneous standard deviation of equity
returns) by means of equation (6):
σV = σE(E/V)/(∂E/∂V).

(6)

The procedure follows Merton (1977) in portraying deposit insurance as a single-period
European put option on the bank’s assets. Merton treats bank equity as the sum of a dividendunprotected European call option and the present value of the dividends distributed before the
option’s expiration date. The bank’s debt is assumed to mature in one year, which is also the
assumed exercise date for the insurer. The model expresses the value of a bank’s equity, E, and
the value of the fair deposit insurance premium, IPP, as:
E = V[1-(1- δ)T] + V(1- δ)TN(x1) - BN(x2),

(7)

IPP = N(-x2) - (1- δ)TN(-x1)V/B.

(8)

3

To establish whether inferences are robust to differences in how forbearance is modeled, it is useful to conduct
regressions using proxies for V, σV, and IPP derived from different models of deposit-insurance option value.
Hovakimian and Kane (2000) provide a detailed discussion of three such models.

8

In (7) and (8), δ is the fraction of bank assets distributed at each interim dividend date to
stockholders, T is the number of interim dividend payments, N(xi) states the probability that the
variate value x is ≤ xi, given that x is distributed with zero mean and unit variance.4
Ronn and Verma (1986) adapt Merton's model to account for the likelihood that safetynet managers would forbear from exercising their right to call the put when their claim is only
slightly in the money. When forbearance occurs, the value of the short position in the put can
turn negative. The RV model scales down the effective exercise price of the put for all banks and
all dates by a factor of ρ = 0.97. The data we employ to estimate equations (2) and (3) set T
equal to one year:
E = V[1-(1- δ)T] + V(1- δ)TN(x3) - ρBN(x4),

(9)

IPP = N(-x4) - (1- δ)TN(-x3)V/B.

(10)

Although we will experiment with other specifications eventually, for fixed samples, the
policy implications of regression experiments using U.S. data have proven relatively insensitive
to variation in ρ5. Moreover, Pennacchi (1987a and b) shows that, by counterfactually presuming
prompt and complete insolvency resolution, single-period models of IPP tend to understate the
economic value that government guarantees convey to bank stockholders. In exploring
differences in risk-shifting opportunities and authorities’ ability to constrain them, this bias
increases the power of regression tests based on a minimal-forbearance model.
II. Input Data
Tables 1 through 3 summarize the synthetic datasets on IPP, B/V, and σV over which we
conduct regression experiments. Our goal is to compare the quality of safety-net management not

x1 = [ln((1-δ)TV/B)+σV2 T/2]/(σV√T), x2 = x1 - σV√T, x3 = [ln((1-δ)TV/ρB)+σV2 T/2]/(σV√T), x4 = x3 - σV√T.
Of course, parameter estimates are sensitive to differences in the years and countries covered in any experiment.

only across countries, but also between commercial banks and savings institutions in each
country.
Because commercial banks are stockholder-owned, regression inputs can be calculated
from data on bank stock prices recorded on Bankscope. However, savings banks and credit
cooperative banks are mutual institutions. This has three important consequences. First, values
for E, B/V and σV must be calculated entirely from book values. Given that balance-sheet data
are reported less frequently than stock prices, variation in returns is bound to be understated for
mutual institutions. Second, at mutuals, risk-taking incentives are blunted because owners and
managers cannot divide potential gains from risk-shifting by writing easily enforceable side
contracts. Third, mutual institutions do not pay dividends. Assuming that market-determined
interest rates are paid on loans and deposits, we treat the reported value of “distributed profits”
(contributions to social works and social funds) as a rough counterpart. In interpreting statistical
tests, we must recognize that the reliability of coefficient estimates in IPP equations for mutuals
is weakened by these difficulties. The Appendix shows the main sources of information
employed to estimate IPP, B/V, and σV values separately for commercial banks and for savings
and cooperative banks. To provide proxies for market-value data for mutual institutions, we
experiment with two alternatives: the first employs book values for E, B/V, and σV; the second
generates synthetic market-value data by using the model and parameters estimated for
commercial banks. Our procedures are summarized in the Appendix.
Table 1 shows the size of sample cells for both types of institutions in each of the EU-15
countries. For all but four countries (Austria, Sweden, Italy, and Germany) the number of
observations for commercial banks exceeds that for mutual institutions. For several countries,
data on mutual institutions are scant and may not be fully representative of overall industry

10

experience. Gaps in data availability persuade us to delete Greece from the study and limitations
on sample size lower the power of statistical tests for comparisons involving a few other
countries.
Table 2 presents estimates of the mean values found for our three input variables at
commercial banks in each country. B/V ranges from a low of 83 percent in Spain to a high of 94
percent in Luxembourg. The mean volatility of returns varies from a low of 1.30 percent in Italy
to a high of 3.22 percent in the United Kingdom. Most importantly, the mean value of safety-net
benefits vary from 13 basis points per Euro in Luxembourg to 28 basis points in Denmark.
For mutual institutions, Table 3 reports safety-net premiums and return volatility in two
ways. Model I applies the RV procedure directly to the accounting values these firms report.
Model II instead runs the accounting data for mutuals through the equations used to generate IPP
and σV for each country’s commercial banks. In most cases, the second procedure greatly lowers
the values of safety-net benefits and volatility at mutual firms. One might interpret this as
evidence that, on average in most EU countries, more outside discipline is exerted on
commercial banks than on savings institutions.

III. Regression Results
However high or low the mean value of safety-net benefits might be in a given country,
the policy problem is to control risk-shifting at the margin. In effect, managers of risky banks
engage regulators and creditors in an endless dynamic game. As creditors and regulators develop
ways to counter a bank’s ability to burden them, bankers devise new strategies for concealing or
understating their exposure to loss. The dialectical nature of this game makes it advisable to
estimate equation (2) and (3) in first-difference form.

11

Individual-Country Estimates. Using a fixed-effects specification for individual institutions
chartered in each country, Tables 4 and 5 estimate leverage and fair-premium equations for
commercial banks and savings institutions separately.
For commercial banks, α1 is significantly negative at better than one percent, except in
Austria, Netherlands, Sweden, and Italy. In the ten other countries, capital discipline
significantly restrains risk. However, β1 still proves positive for all countries, ranging from 0.001
in Austria and in France to 0.045 in Sweden. At one-percent significance, only for Austria,
Finland and France can we reject the hypothesis that safety-net subsidies exist. Incremental
safety-net control is weakest in Sweden, Ireland, Netherlands, and Denmark.
With the exception of Sweden, the values of α1 and β1 found for mutual institutions in
Table 5 using Model I do not differ much from those reported for banks in Table 4. When Model
II is used to adjust accounting data, α1 typically becomes more negative, but β1 usually becomes
more positive. However, when we use accounting data to fit the model to commercial banks,
results do not differ significantly from those reported in Table 4. This suggests that, by itself,
disciplining accounting capital might prove a more reliable way to control risk-shifting at
commercial banks than at savings institutions.
Still, judging by our baseline Model I estimates, it appears that capital discipline
importantly influences risk-taking at savings institutions. Except in Netherlands and Italy, α1
proves significantly negative at one percent, but at that level of significance, the hypothesis of
incremental safety-net subsidies (i.e., positive β1) is rejected only for Finland and France. The
good news is that the magnitude of estimated safety-net benefits at savings institutions is
relatively small, exceeding 7 basis points only for Denmark, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Sweden,
and Italy.

12

Partitioning Countries by IPP and β1 Values. Our policy focus is how the costs of resolving
financial-institution distress might seep unrecognized across borders. Figure 1 divides the 14
counties into three classes based on observable clusters in the mean value of their IPP for banks.
Countries whose IPP is 15 basis points or less are coded as “low.” Countries whose IPP are 20
basis points or higher are coded as “high” IPP. The other five countries (Austria, Finland,
Ireland, Netherlands, and Sweden) are coded as “medium.”
The policy issue is whether adverse economic shocks could force taxpayers and
regulators in low-β1 countries to pay for weaknesses in market and regulatory oversight exerted
on institutions by high-β1 countries. To explore this issue, in Figure 2 we use the β1 estimates
reported in Tables 4 and 5 to partition the commercial-bank and savings-bank samples into three
clusters: β1 ≤ .05; .05 < β1 < .012; β1 ≥ .012.
Both for banks and for supervisory officials, incentives for risk-shifting intensify as an
institution slides into financial distress (Marcus, 1984; Kane, 1989). To protect taxpayers in
home and host countries, markets and officials in high-β1 countries must have the authority to
subject troubled banks to significantly stronger disciplines. To investigate this question, we
experiment with two dummy variables. What we call the “low-capital dummy” equals 1 for
institutions that fall in the less capitalized (i.e., more levered) half of the aggregate sample in the
preceding period and equals zero otherwise. As a robustness check, we employ an alternative
“high-premium dummy” that equals one for institutions whose fair premium exceeded the
median value recorded in the previous period.
In Tables 6 and 7, each dummy is interacted with ΔσV. In the columns reporting on these
experiments, the total effect of ΔσV on the leverage ratio and fair premium is the sum of the two
coefficients shown.

13

Very different pictures emerge for banks and for savings institutions. In the IPP equations
for banks in the higher-β1 subsamples, the value of access to safety-net subsidies falls for
distressed banks and the decline is significant in three of the four cells. On the other hand, in the
IPP equations for savings institutions, discipline strengthens for troubled institutions (though
only at 5 percent significance) in low-β1 countries, but falls sharply in high-β1 jurisdictions. This
is true even though leverage restrictions tighten significantly when distress emerges.
These results support the hypothesis that, in EU countries, it has been difficult for
commercial banks and easy for savings institutions to expand their access to safety-net subsidies
when they fall into distress. Still, because few savings institutions are large enough to command
too-big-to-fail benefits or to engage in substantial cross-border activity, their risk-shifting
capacity seems unlikely to create important loss exposures for regulators and taxpayers in partner
countries. The greater concern should attach to large commercial banks operating in home or
host countries whose safety-net management is not yet up to speed.
Evidence of Learning by Doing. Table 8 reports on the age of individual-country depositinsurance schemes. Hovakimian, Kane, and Laeven (2003) find that in the early years of
operating a deposit-insurance system, officials are apt to do a poor job of replacing the depositor
discipline they displace. Tables 9 and 10 investigate this issue for our EU-14, partitioned by the
effectiveness of safety-net management.
Both for commercial banks and for savings institutions, the tables indicate that countries
whose safety-net management is highly effective established tight control from the outset. The
statistical significance of the system’s age in the other two subsamples indicates that safety-net
managers in other countries did tend to improve their control as their systems aged.

14

IV. Robustness Issues
Potentially observable sources of variation might explain at least some cross-country
differences. This section investigates four possibilities.
1. Effects from Differences in Character of Deposit-Insurance Coverage and Management.
Tables 11 and 12 depict several ways that deposit-insurance schemes in the EU-15 differ in
structure. Although one might suppose that differences in the design features imbedded in
different deposit-insurance schemes could explain the bulk of cross-country differences in loss
control, the evidence suggests that differences in regulatory culture and environment are more
important. For example, narrow coverage does not translate directly into either low β1 or low
IPP. Denmark, Finland, and Sweden cover the fewest categories of deposit, but our regressions
classify none of them as a low-IPP country and only one of them (Finland) as a low-β1 country.
Also, slope coefficients differ negligibly and insignificantly between countries whose schemes
do and do not cover deposits that are denominated in foreign currencies or held by very large
companies.
Table 13 does indicate (and covariance tests confirm) that schemes that are chartered
either as private or public organizations control risk with similar effectiveness, and better than
schemes in which private and public officials share control. The same table finds that schemes
that separately guarantee the deposits of commercial banks and savings institutions are negligibly
more effective than joint-liability arrangements.
2. Effects From Differences in Country Size. One might also expect safety-net subsidies to vary
with the tax capacity of individual countries. We study this issue indirectly by asking whether
risk-shifting behavior varies with aggregate income. Table 14 partitions sample countries into
three classes: those with GDP below 100 million euros, those with GDP between 100 and 350

15

million euros; and those with GDP over 350 million euros. GDP data cover 2004 and come from
Eurostat. Covariance tests find no differences in capital discipline by country size. The lowest
p-value is 0.17 for differences in slopes between the medium and lowest GDP size classes.
However, safety-net subsidies are higher in the smallest countries and the differences prove
significant for all pairs by covariance tests. The p-values range between 0.01 and 0.03 and
indicate that undesirable distributional effects are more intense in smaller countries. This may be
because their governments lack the capacity either to finance or to execute preventive
supervision as effectively.
3. Effects from Government Ownership. The risk-shifting process passes losses directly to
taxpayers in state-owned institutions. This leads us to investigate whether incentives at publiclyowned banks might differ from those at private institutions. Banks are defined as publicly-owned
if a public (national, regional or local) authority holds at least 50 percent of its capital. The
differences are shown in Table 15. Safety-net subsidies do prove significantly lower for public
banks, but only at the 2-percent level. However, the data reject the hypothesis that capital
discipline varies between privately-owned and publicly-owned banks (the p-value for the
covariance test is 0.22).
4. Effects from Special Governmental Support of Major Banks. Since differences across EU
countries in risk-shifting incentives are more likely to affect multinational banks, we compare
risk-shifting behavior at country-champion banks with that for other sample banks. Countrychampion banks are defined as those whose total assets fall in the first size decile of EU banks.
These banks are listed in the Appendix. Table 16 shows that country-champion banks do extract
higher incremental safety-net benefits. The p-value of the relevant covariance test is 0.01. At

16

the same time, α1 estimates show that country-champion banks receive stronger capital discipline
on average and this difference proves statistically significant at 2 percent.

V. Policy implications for EU Merger Policies
Contestability theories of market structure stress the importance of entry and exit costs.
Incentives exist for national governments to protect domestic institutions from entry by foreign
competitors and to resist the exit of important domestic enterprises by bailing them out when
they become insolvent. The strength and predictability of these incentives let bank stakeholders
estimate fair insurance premiums for commercial banks and savings institutions in each country.
In countries like the Netherlands where three large institutions dominate banking markets and
foreign competition was until recently discouraged, too-big-to-fail benefits can be substantial.
Although the mean value of the safety-net benefits reported in Tables 2 and 3 range only
between 13 and 32 basis points, these estimates are biased downward by using a model that
assumes counterfactually that safety-net enhancements expire after only one year. Although our
findings are subject to simultaneous-equations bias from treating changes in volatility as
exogenous, our estimates of the rate at which benefits increase with increments in volatility (β1)
avoid early-expiration bias. The magnitude of this coefficient ranges from 10 to 450 basis points
for commercial banks and from 40 to 760 basis points for savings institutions.
Some high-β1 countries (e.g., Sweden) have suffered sectoral crises, but several (e.g.,
Netherlands) have not. In any case, it is particularly dangerous for the EU either to permit banks
such as Nordea to move their headquarters from low-β1 to high-β1 locales or to allow banks from

17

high-IPP and high-β1 countries to exploit the single-license framework to expand their footings
in low-β1 countries.
Consistent with the hypothesis of cross-country risk-shifting, table 17 indicates that
capital and IPP discipline is less effective at offshore subsidiary banks than at parent institutions
and that multinational organizations experience significantly less aggregate restraint from both
home and host regulators than purely domestic banks do. Table 18 shows that, vis-à-vis
estimated safety-net benefits, acquisition activity appears to move both uphill and downhill.
Banks from high-IPP and high-β1 countries have both initiated and received the lion’s share of
cross-border merger and acquisition activity. From a global perspective, entry of banks from or
into high-premium or low-control home countries can generate undesirable efficiency,
distributional, and stabilization effects. Sooner or later, EU authorities will have to confront the
coordination challenges that these effects raise.

APPENDIX
Four focal variables appear in our analysis:
- B, total debt: computed as the difference between the book values of total assets and common
equity.
- E, the market value of a bank’s equity: computed as the end-of-period stock-market
capitalization.
- σE, standard deviation of the return on equity: computed as the standard deviation of: (1)
deleveraged quarterly holding-period returns on stock for commercial banks and (2) reported
quarterly return on equity reported by mutual institutions.
- δ, fraction of bank assets distributed yearly as dividends to stockholders.
These variables are taken directly from the Bankscope database, provided by Bureau Van
Dijk.
Since a market value for equity cannot be observed for (non-quoted) savings &
cooperative banks, we experiment for these institutions with two different models of IPP, B/V
and σV values.
-

Model I: This is our baseline model. It employs market or market-like values wherever

possible. Since savings and cooperative banks do not pay dividends, we represent
“distributed profits” as a “social dividend” that is intended to capture community claims
that are exerted on these institutions. The “social dividend” consists primarily of
contributions to social works and social funds.

21

-

Model II: Accounting values for IPP and σV are understated because book values that are

reported annually cannot capture intrayear variation in B/V and σV. Model II estimates
IPP, B/V, and σV by means of equations fitted to data for commercial banks. The
procedure has two steps. The first step estimates equations for commercial banks in each
country. In the second step, the accounting data for a country’s savings & cooperative
banks are fed as input data through the numerical equations that generated IPP and σV for
that country’s commercial banks. The following example employs real data to illustrate
how V and σV are obtained from model II using a randomly chosen savings bank i from
Germany that we will call SBi:
Step 1: Fitted model for the average commercial bank in Germany in 2000:
σV = σE(E/V)/(∂E/∂V) = (0.091)(0.243)/(1,474) = 0.015
E = V[1-(1- δ)T] + V(1- δ)TN(x3) - ρBN(x4) = V [1-(1- 0.23)1] + V(1- 0.23)1N(x3)
- 0.97(18523)N(x4);
E=1636;
V = 6732 ;

Step 2: Fitted model for SBi in 2000:
The σE, (∂E/∂V), δ, Τ and ρ parameters and the probabilities for normal densities
estimated for commercial banks are used to compute “market” values of σV and V
for savings bank SBi:
σV = σE(E/V)/(∂E/∂V) = (0.091)(0.198)/(1,474) = 0.012
E = V[1-(1- δ)T] + V(1- δ)TN(x3) - ρBN(x4) = V[1-(1- 0.023)1] + V(10.023)1N(x3) - 0.97(15268)N(x4); V = 5327
