Acting White or Acting Black: Mixed-Race Adolescents' Identity and Behavior

NBER Working Paper No. 13793
February 2008
JEL No. J11,J13,J15,Z13
ABSTRACT
Although rates of interracial marriage are on the rise, we still know relatively little about the experiences
of mixed-race adolescents. In this paper, we examine the identity and behavior of mixed-race (black
and white) youth. We find that mixed-race youth adopt both types of behaviors -- those that can be
empirically characterized as “black” and those that can be characterized as "white". When we combine
both types of behavior, average mixed-race behavior is a combination that is neither white nor black,
and the variance in mixed-race behavior is generally greater than the variance in behavior of monoracial
adolescents, especially as compared to the black racial group. Adolescence is the time during which
there is most pressure to establish an identity, and our results indicate that mixed-race youth are finding
their own distinct identities, not necessarily "joining" either monoracial group, but in another sense
joining both of them.

1. Introduction
The constant of the postwar American family is change. Abundant scholarship documents the increasing
likelihood of divorce and single parenthood, later age at first marriage, and the rise of extramarital cohabitation,
same-sex unions, and interracial marriage (Stevenson and Wolfers 2007). The rise of interracial marriage since
the US Supreme Court struck down state anti-miscegenation laws in 1967 is notable. Between 1970 and 2000
the number of black-white marriages increased five-fold (Rosenfeld and Kim 2005). By 2000 over seven
percent of black men were married to white women, and nearly 3 percent of black women were married to
white men (Fryer 2007). Although interracial marriage remains relatively rare it is on the rise.
Scholars have focused on several features of interracial marriage, including sociological and economic
studies of the marriage market (Rosenfeld and Kim 2005; Joyner and Kao 2005; Fryer 2007), how the law
accommodates nontraditional unions (Kennedy 2003; Romano 2003), the consequences of interracial mating for
the psychological health and sociological adjustments of these unions’ mixed-race offspring (Tizard and
Phoenix 2002); the educational achievement of mixed-race children (Kao 1999; Harris and Thomas 2002;
Herman 2002); risk taking by mixed-race youth (Udry et al 2003); as well as the personal and social
construction of mixed-race identities (Harris 2001; Harris 2002; Harris and Sim 2002). Our study addresses the
last three of these issues in that we investigate how a mixed-race identity influences a wide range of teenage
academic and risk-taking behaviors relative to the behaviors of their monoracial peers.
The first systematic social science studies of mixed-race people in the early twentieth century argued
that, because they were perpetual outsiders, mixed-race individuals were more prone to psychological disorders
and social pathologies than monoracial individuals (Park 1929; Park 1931; Stonequist 1937). But recent
increases in interracial marriage and the number of mixed-race children have spawned a new interest in their
experiences and development. While the modern literature accepts that modern mixed-race individuals must
navigate certain strains, conflicts and ambiguities not faced by monoracial individuals, there is abundant
evidence that mixed-race youth develop positive self-images and healthy identities (Daniel 1996; Tizard and
Phoenix 2002).

2

We investigate the extent to which mixed-race youth adopt the behavioral norms of their white or black
peers or whether they sometimes adopt distinct behaviors that are neither stereotypically black nor white. We
find that mixed-race youth struggle to establish a unique identity in at least some dimensions. It is important not
to equate identity with behavior, of course, but much behavior is purposeful and designed to project a public
image or persona not inconsistent with the person’s beliefs or the salience an association holds for that
individual.
One of this study’s contributions to the literature is our rejection of the standard economic practice of
viewing race, like sex, as immutable and an exogenously determined datum. Sociology and psychology have
long recognized that race, like any other personal characteristic, is socially constructed and therefore
changeable. Economists have only recently begun to investigate the extent to which economic processes
influence racial determination and vice versa (Darity et al 2006). Although macro-level social processes
establish the choice set of identities available to the individual, there remains an element of choice in racial
identification. Moreover, racial identification and the resulting behaviors translate physical characteristics into
human capital with an economic value.
It is also important to emphasize that this study focuses on mixed-race youth defined by ancestry or
parents’ races. It addresses issues of complexion or phenotype indirectly, if at all. An emergent economic
literature connects phenotype and outcomes, and generally finds that lighter complected individuals earn higher
incomes, accumulate more wealth, and generally fare better in several dimensions that their darker complected
peers (Bodenhorn 2003; Goldsmith et al 2006; Hersch 2006; Gyimah-Brempong and Price 2006; Bodenhorn
and Ruebeck 2007; Goldsmith et al 2007). We cannot draw a connection between mixed-race individuals and
complexion-based differentials because, as Rangel (2007) shows, race mixing does not uniquely map into
phenotype because parents of given phenotypes produce offspring drawn from a distribution of potential
complexions. The data we employ identify mixed-race individuals, but reveal nothing definitive about their
complexions.
Specifically, we use a rich data set on adolescents to test hypotheses about differences in mixed-race and
monoracial behaviors as evidence for differences in identity. Although complexion is not definitively measured,
3

the data do allow us to use a number of different definitions and so compare our findings across the various
measures of adolescents’ racial group. The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. In section 2 we introduce a
model of identity and behavior which provides a framework for our empirical analysis. In section 3, we discuss
our data and our different measures of race. Section 4 presents our empirical model and summary statistics.
Section 5 presents the results of our classification of adolescent behavior along racial lines, while section 6
presents our results aimed at determining the variation in mixed-race individual’s identities. Section 7 provides
the results of a sensitivity analysis while section 8 concludes our analysis.

2. Conceptual apparatus
In this section, we outline a stylized model of identity and behavior inspired by Akerlof and Kranton
(2000; 2002), one that follows from Benjamin et al. (2007). The model organizes our thinking about the issues
of racial identity and behavioral choices among mixed-race children, but we do not provide a formal test of the
theory per se. It nevertheless remains a useful heuristic and the empirical results reported below are consistent
with the model’s predictions. In our framework, peer and familial pressures to adopt certain identity-related
behaviors influence the individual’s choice of activities, based on his or her personal preferences and the
salience of racial identification. Models based on Akerlof and Kranton’s framework (see also Bodenhorn and
Ruebeck, 2003) also recognize that economic incentives can influence the choice of identity directly. In fact, it
is the tension between pecuniary and psychic incentives that motivate these and related theories.
Let x be some decision variable, such as how much of a certain activity an individual may engage in.
The choice of activities may or may not be associated with existing racial behavioral norms. Individuals identify
with a given racial category R with salience s. Let x0 denote the optimal engagement in activity x absent racial
identity considerations. Similarly, let xR denote the existing racial behavioral norm associated with an activity
and prescribed for members of race R by the members of each race. The behaviors are stereotypical in the sense
that members of each race collectively define what they believe to be appropriate behavior for others of the
same race.

4

We assume there are two races, R = w (white) or b (black), each with reasonably well established
behavioral norms. There exist as well members of a third, emergent mixed-race group for whom a prescribed
norm does not yet exist. Mixed-race individuals face peer and familial pressures to adopt behaviors consistent
with one of the existing racial norms, while personal preferences and economic incentives may imply higher
levels of utility from alternative behaviors consistent with neither existing racial norm. Assume further that
mixed-race individuals place weights 0 ! wb (s) , ww (s) ! 1 on conforming to either the black or white
behavioral norms, where s represents the salience or strength of a particular racial identity to the individual.
The individual chooses x to maximize

(1)

U = ! (1! ww(s) ! wb(s))(x!x0)2 ! ww(s)(x!xw)2 ! wb(s)(x!xb)2 .

We further assume that wb (0) = ww (0) = 0 and that w "b (s), w "w (s) > 0. The assumptions and the form of the
utility function imply that deviations from a racial norm prescribed by peers or family members cause disutility
!
!s , the power of the individual’s affiliation with a racial norm,
that is increasing in the salience of racial identity

and the distance between a given activity and the racial norm. The individual also suffers disutility when she
deviates from her personal optimum level of activity x. Thus, the individual faces a tradeoff between being true
to herself and being true to social expectations regarding her behavior based on the racial image she projects.
The first-order condition of (1) defines the optimal level of x,

(2)

x* = (1 ! ww(s) ! wb(s))x0 + ww(s)xw + wb(s)xb ,

a weighted average of the individual optimum and the existing racial norms. This specification does not limit
mixed-race individuals to adopt behaviors that are convex combinations of existing black and white behaviors,
rather they are convex combination of existing black behaviors, white behaviors and behaviors consistent with
the individual’s personal optimum behavior absent identity pressures. The first right-hand side term affords the
5

mixed-race youth the opportunity to adopt behaviors that are neither stereotypically black nor stereotypically
white, behaviors that may be “outside” the established racial norms.
The model yields two predictions that bear on our study of mixed-race youth.

Prediction 1: The stronger the salience of a given racial behavioral norm, the closer the individual x* will be to
either xb or xw.
An example, although not one that we test directly here, is the still-controversial “acting white”
hypothesis (Fordham and Ogbu 1986; Austen-Smith and Fryer 2005; Fryer and Torelli 2005; Ferguson 2006;
Tyson and Darity 2005). If a mixed-race youth faces peer pressures to express black identity through
engagement in stereotypically black behaviors, and black behaviors are “oppositional” in that they reject white
norms of academic achievement, peer pressure may lead him to achieve a lower grade point averages. If the
“acting white” phenomenon is real and black racial salience is powerful for mixed-race youth in academic
matters, we may observe lower grade point averages among mixed-race youth than would be predicted by
observable family, personal and school characteristics. Although Ferguson (2006) fails to find evidence of
them, sociologists and psychologists report pressures placed on mixed-race youth by monoracial youth to
demonstrate racial authenticity in various dimensions, so we may observe multi-race youth adopting a wide
range of behaviors, depending on the salience of white or black race in a particular circumstance (Tizard and
Phoenix 2002; Williams 1996; Root 1997).

Prediction 2: The responsiveness of the individual’s engagement in activity x to racial salience is determined
by

(3)

!x*/!s = w "w (s)(xw"x0) + w "b (s)(wb"x0) .

! which depends,
! of course, on the signs of (x "x ) and (w "x ) and the relative magnitudes of the

relevant terms, which cannot be known absent a specific parameterization of the model. Nevertheless, the
6

general result reveals that the individual’s adjustment to changes in salience depends on the relative distances of
the mixed-race youth’s personal optimum engagement in an activity and the prescribed racial behavioral norms.
Suppose, without loss of generality, that xw – x0 > 0 and xb - x0 < 0 (or, that the mixed-race youth’s
personal optimum is closer to the black than the white behavioral norm), then the effect of racial salience on the
behavioral choice will be determined by

Given the assumptions, equation

rapidly the greater the initial distance between the white norm and the youth’s optimum engagement in x. But
depending on the forms of the w(s)’s and the value of s itself, !2x*/!s2 might be either positive or negative. As
Benjamin et al (2007) note, it may be that individuals with greater racial salience are more accepting of racial
norms (w" > 0); or it might be that individuals become saturated with the racial norm (w" < 0).
To summarize, mixed-race youth behaviors may reveal greater diversity than monoracial behaviors.
Because they face conflicting familial and peer pressures regarding “correct” behavior, mixed-race youth will
sometimes engage in stereotypically white behaviors, stereotypically black behaviors, and unique behaviors that
are neither black nor white. Moreover, because the salience of race is likely to vary more across mixed-race
than monoracial youth in at least some circumstances, we expect to observe a greater variance of mixed-race
behaviors driven by the absence of established mixed-race behavioral norms.

3. Data
To assess the connection between behaviors and identity among mixed-race individuals, we use data
collected by the Adolescent Health Survey (commonly referred to as AddHealth), a school-based nationally
representative survey of students, parents, and school administrators concerning the health-related behaviors of
adolescents in grades 7 through 12. Research dating to at least Erikson (1968) reveals that the initial steps
toward identity formation are taken in adolescence, when youth have accumulated enough experience to
adequately assess life goals and personal values (see Furstenberg 2000 for a recent review). Archer (1982)
argues that adolescence, especially early to mid-adolescence, represents a critical period in identity formation
because the physical changes surrounding puberty and the widening of the circle of acquaintances typically
result in self-appraisal and emergent concerns about behavior. Given the increasing number of mixed-race
individuals going through the process of identity development, sociologists and psychologists have grown
increasingly interested in their experiences (Tizard and Phoenix 2002). We consider the choices that
adolescents make, choices that are not only a function of their emergent identity but determinants of their future
livelihoods as well. Thus, our research contributes to this emergent literature because it is among the first to
offer an empirical assessment of mixed-race behaviors and identity formation through the lens of “the
economics of identity.”
Adolescents were interviewed for the AddHealth study in consecutive academic years, 1994-95 (Wave
1) and 1995-96 (Wave 2). In each wave, information on a wide range of risky and pro-social behaviors,
academic outcomes, and family characteristics was collected. The Wave 1 survey included two components: an
in-school survey and an at-home survey. The in-school survey was given during one class period (45 to 60
minutes) to more than 90,000 students and was administered between September 1994 and April 1995. The athome survey, a sub-sample of the in-school sample, was administered to 20,745 adolescents, and was typically
conducted in the adolescent’s home in a one to two hour period. The Wave 1 survey was administered between
September 1994 and December 1995. To reduce the likelihood of purposive misreporting on sensitive topics,
interviewers assured students that their answers could not be matched to their names and questions were
8

answered on a computer controlled by the adolescent student. Wave 2, which was also conducted at-home, was
administered to nearly 15,000 of the same students surveyed in Wave 1 approximately one year later. At Wave
1, the mother (or other female head of the household) of the originally-sampled adolescent was asked to
participate in a 40-minute, interviewer-administered survey regarding the health status and behaviors of the
adolescent, home environment, and the adolescent’s interpersonal relationships. AddHealth preferred to have
the mother fill out the parent’s questionnaire because mothers are generally believed to be more familiar than
fathers with the schooling, health status, and health behaviors of their children.
We make use of responses collected from the in-school, at-home, and parental components of the
survey. Our first task is to identify mixed-race adolescents, and towards this purpose AddHealth provides
multiple sources. Although the in-school survey asked each adolescent to self-report her or his race with the
option to select more than one racial category, self-reported race is potentially endogenous to identity
development and to the observable behaviors and other outcomes we study. We thus use as our primary source
of racial identity the parental survey conducted in the Wave 1 at-home survey in which a parent (usually the
mother as explained above), was asked to report their own race, as well as the race of their partner. Information
on the parents’ races should be less endogenous than the adolescent’s self-reported race is to the adolescent’s
outcomes. Parents, too, could select more than one racial category. Because our interest is in the black/white
dichotomy which characterizes the “acting white” research, we limit ourselves to considering those respondents
who noted that they were black and/or white. Respondents who did not check either black or white are not
included in our analysis. Note that if an individual marked white, black, or both but also marked one of the
other three categories that AddHealth records (asian, American Indian, other), we did not drop them because we
already have a small sample of mixed race adolescents. Thus, when we use the term “mixed race”, we use it to
refer to those individual who are reported (by themselves or their parents) to at least be both black and white.1

1

We label this group “mixed-race” for convenience and expositional clarity. In so doing, we sacrifice precision, but because no
generally acceptable terminology has yet emerged, we trade precision for a greater rhetorical clarity. Other studies have investigated
the experiences of children from racially mixed parents and have drawn parallels between their experiences and those of black-white
mixed race (Kao 1999; Harris and Sim 2002).

9

Our use of parental-based adolescent race forces us to limit our sample to adolescents living in intact
families because single parents are not asked to report the other biological parent’s race. Although this poses
some disadvantages, mostly because black youth are significantly less likely to live in intact families and
children in single-parent homes are more likely to engage in risky behaviors than children in traditional twoparent households (McLanahan and Sandefur 1994), focusing our attention on this group reduces racial
identification endogeneity and eliminates at least one confounding source of variation (Bryson 1995). Another
disadvantage to using the at-home sample is that we have few adolescents whose parents report a racially mixed
relationship. To address this drawback, we merge the data from both Waves 1 and 2 of AddHealth so that each
mixed-race adolescent is observed twice. As is typical in longitudinal data sets, the racial identification
questions were asked at baseline (Wave 1) and not at Wave 2. After linking the parental race information with
the adolescent information in Waves 1 and 2 (we refer to the combination of Waves 1 and 2 as the at-home
sample) and dropping those observations without a sample weight, we identified 63 adolescents who had one
white parent and one black parent and from whom we draw our principal conclusions about mixed-race
behavior and identity. We take care not to draw sweeping generalizations based on our modest sample size. To
address the more general population and increase the sample size of all racial groups, but at the potential
expense of endogenous racial identification, we then repeat our analysis with racial group identified directly by
the surveyed adolescent, widening the sample to include non-intact families in Waves 1 and 2 and then the
larger in-school sample. The advantage of the in-school data is that is includes responses from more than
90,000 respondents and about 800 of these self-report being mixed-race. We will report on results using the
following five samples: (1) Waves 1 & 2 at-home survey, intact families, race based on parents; (2) Waves 1 &
2 at-home survey, intact families, race based on adolescents’ self-report; (3) Waves 1 & 2 at-home survey, all
adolescents, self-reported race; (4) in-school survey, intact families, self-reported race; and (5) in-school survey,
all adolescents, self-reported race. We choose these samples to logically expand beyond the first (preferred)
sample and make relevant comparisons among the results. The at-home samples have, in addition to parents’
race, a more rich set of behaviors; our analysis of the two in-school samples thus depends on a smaller set of
behaviors and control variables.
10

Using our preferred sample (intact families from Waves 1 and 2 of the at-home sample), Table 1 reveals
that there is not perfect agreement between adolescents’ self-reports and parental racial categorizations. Of the
63 adolescents in Wave 1 from intact inter-racial families, 26 identified themselves as mixed-race: 3 with a
black mother and white father, and 23 with a white mother and black father. The thirty-seven remaining with
racially mixed parents mostly identified as “Black” (17), some as “White” (7) and the rest as “Other” (13). The
category “Other” is small because we have excluded adolescents whose parents did not check either black or
white. Although it captures potential errors in coding or completing the survey, most of these “Other”
observations are purposive choices by adolescents of one of the other three categories provided by AddHealth.

Notes to Table 1: The grey cells are the 63 adolescents identified as mixed-race by their parents’ racial identification. B = black; W =
white; Mix = mixed-race for parents. Parents, like their adolescent children, could self-report more than one racial identifier and
several did. We consider that person’s child to be mixed-race (black and white) if one parent selected black as at least one identifier
and the other chose white as at least one identifier. We have a greater number of observations in later tables that use both Waves 1 and
2; this table only reports on Wave 1 observations.

Our focus is on the adolescents’ race as implied by parental race and we find results robust to our
methods of measuring adolescent race when we extend our results to include samples in which adolescent race
is self-reported, but we conclude this section with a discussion of the disagreements between the measures.
Using a different subset of the AddHealth data, Harris and Sim (2002) conclude that race is fluid among a
significant proportion of adolescents. Their study finds that, whereas 6.8 percent of survey respondents report a
mixed racial heritage when completing the in-school survey, only 3.6 percent responded similarly on the athome portion. When considering intact, two-parent families they find 4.8% of students come from mixed-race
11

backgrounds. Hitlin et al. (2006) extend the work of Harris and Sim by using Waves 1 and 3 of the Addhealth
survey and report that between Waves 1 and 3 there are racial identification changes.2
AddHealth interviewers were also asked to “Code the race of the respondent based on your observation
alone.” Unlike respondents, however, interviewers were not allowed to select more than one racial category in
describing respondents, and they answered this question after respondents provided their self-identification. As
it stands, interviewers coded 14 of those who self-reported black as white and 18 of those self-reporting white
as black. Of those who self-reported mixed, 70 percent were classified as black by the interviewers, indicating
that the classification heuristic used by the interviewers appears consistent with Davis’ (1991) contention that
the “one-drop rule” still holds sway in modern America. That is, any individual with any trace of black heritage
is more likely to be viewed as black. When we use parental race reports (the group described in Table 1), we
find that of the 63 adolescents with one black and one white parent, 31 are categorized as black by interviewers,
20 as white, and the remaining 11 as one of the other three racial categories. It appears that when the parental
race reports are used to classify the adolescent the “one-drop rule” tended to break down.3

4: Empirical method and summary statistics
Our analysis of mixed-race behaviors and their relationship to identity choices unfolds in three steps. We
first look for differences in average behaviors between the monoracial white and black adolescents. These
differences are predominant or typical rather than stereotypical because our data-driven method sometimes
produces results that differ from popular portrayals. That first step allows us to empiricially identify behaviors
that are predominantly white, predominantly black, or neither. Our second step investigates differences in mean
behavior between the black, white, and mixed-race groups, allowing us to categorize mixed-race behavior

2

We not make use of the Wave 3 data for our analysis as the youth were no longer adolescents at the time Wave 3 was fielded.
To offer some insight into the factors influencing adolescent racial self-reporting, we regressed a binary identifier of the adolescent’s
self-reported mixed-race identity against mother’s race, father’s race, whether the parent was born in the U.S., parents’ social status,
and parental education using a standard probit specification. The results (not reported here) reveal that adolescents with black mothers
and white fathers are significantly less likely to self-report as mixed-race than adolescents with white mothers and black fathers, as
Table 1 would lead us to expect. Those with native-born fathers are also more likely to report being mixed. When parental education is
included, we find that those with college-educated mothers are more likely to report being mixed-race, as are those with mother’s who
receive welfare.

relative to other racial groups. Our analysis then turns to inter-group differences in the intra-group variance of
behaviors. Throughout these analyses, we investigate the sensitivity of the results to alternative samples of the
AddHealth data and alternative measures of racial identity.
Our empirical model is
(6)

where i subscripts individuals, s subscripts schools, and t subscripts time (Waves 1 and 2). AddHealth is a
school-based sampling design, so ! controls for school-level fixed effects4 to net out time invariant
heterogeneity that may be correlated with unobservables in the idiosyncratic error " . Y represents the behavior
under study, and X is a vector of demographic characteristics. Our explanatory variables of interest are the

racial categories: white is the omitted category, B = 1 if the individual is identified as black by their parents and

zero otherwise, and M = 1 if the respondent is identified as mixed (black and white) by their parents and zero
otherwise. Note that race is only subscripted over i and s because individuals were only asked their race in
Wave 1. Because Y is sometimes measured as a dichotomous variable and sometimes as an index or the
frequency of an event, we estimate the parameters in (6) using linear probability models. This specification
(rather than probit or logit) is also necessary in order to include the school fixed effects. Because we observe
some adolescents more than one, robust standard errors are reported.
Table 2 presents the variable definitions and the sample means for the more than 40 behaviors and
attitudes we analyzed as dependent variables. The variables can be grouped into five broad behavioral
categories: sexual activity, substance abuse, delinquent behaviors, time use and school-related behaviors. Most
responses to survey questions regarding behavioral choices are recorded as dichotomous variables; for example,
“Have you ever been a regular cigarette smoker?” Some, however, are recorded as frequencies; for example,
“How many hours did you spend watching television last week?”
In addition (and included in Table 2), we also created three behavior indices by summing a student’s
responses across several survey items and then dividing by the number of items over which the index was

created. The question groups were implied by the survey structure because they were asked in a sequential
manner, as in: “How often have you had trouble at school with: homework? teachers?” etc. The first index
combines attitudes towards school and includes six questions. The second index summarizes four negative
school-related troubles, such as having difficulties with teachers, with fellow students, with paying attention in
class, or with completing homework assignments. A third index averages over nine behaviors to create a
delinquency scale similar to that created by Resnick et al. (1997). In every case, a calculation of Cronbach’s
alpha produced a statistic exceeding 0.7, a commonly used cutoff for inferring that the indices are internally
consistent.
Taken on their own and without controlling for any other factors, the behavioral questions and the
behavior indices summarized in Table 2 present a complex portrait of mixed-race behaviors. Although mixedrace adolescents, on average, report higher satisfaction with school than whites or blacks, they simultaneously
report having more troubles in school and skipping school more often. Mixed-race adolescents are also more
likely than either blacks or whites to report having had sexual intercourse, to watch more television, and to
exhibit higher delinquency rates. If behavioral choices are indicative of identity development, the simple
averages reported in Table 2 suggest that, as a group, mixed-race adolescents are engaged in a wide range of
activities. The averages conceal whether each mixed-race individual is experimenting with a wider range of
behaviors or whether there is a wider variance of behaviors across individuals. The third step of our empirical
analysis confronts this issue.
Racial behavioral differences documented elsewhere for adolescents are evident here. We find that, for
example, white adolescents are more likely to have regularly smoked cigarettes, drank alcohol, and smoked
marijuana in the 30 days prior to the survey, while blacks were more likely to report having been sexually
active. These differences are consistent with data from the 2005 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Because
our preferred sample includes only intact families, the results are not necessarily representative of adolescents in
other family types. As explained in Section 3, we also expand our investigations to include wider samples from
the AddHealth data. In the appendix, Tables A1 and A2 report summary statistics for the behaviors and

14

attitudes of our four additional samples; Table A1 for the at-home samples and Table A2 for the in-school
samples. For details, see the discussion in the appendix.
Table 3 presents the means of our control variables: the adolescent’s age, sex, place of residence, and
religiosity, as well as controls for parental income, age, education, nativity and occupation. Dummy variables
are included to account for missing data in the relevant cells. Similar tables for the other samples are reported in
the appendix Tables A3 and A4. The controls reveal some additional notable differences between mixed-race
adolescents and their monoracial peers. Mixed-race youth reside in households with lower average incomes, are
more likely to live in an urban environment, are more likely than black youth to be Catholic, are more likely to
have foreign-born parents, to have an unemployed parent, and to live in a household receiving welfare
payments.

5: Race and behavioral propensities: Which behaviors are “black”? Which behaviors are “white”?
Figure 1 provides a heuristic for interpreting the first step in our analysis. Behaviors are classified as
predominantly black or white depending on the statistical significance of the coefficient on the black indicator
variable estimated by Equation 6 for each behavior or attitude. The first significant contribution of our research
is that this approach itself yields some interesting and potentially counterintuitive results. Those behaviors that
are not associated with either monoracial group are not included in subsequent analyses.
Figure 1. Classifying behavior as Black or White

Tables 4a, 4b, and 4c present the results of classifying behaviors according to Figure 1. To conserve
space, we do not report the estimated coefficients on the control variables for our preferred sample in Table 4a.
15

For the same reason, we summarize only the classifications from Figure 1 for our other four samples in Tables
4b and 4c, omitting the estimated coefficients entirely. The classification results from Table 4a are repeated in
Table 4b, along with the other two samples from the at-home survey. Table 4c reports the classification results
for our two samples from the in-school survey. Notably, with respect to black and white behaviors, there are no
contradictions in categorization among the three samples in Table 4b, nor between the two samples in Table 4c.
We do see that larger sample sizes (recorded in Tables 2, A1, and A2) generally lead to fewer categorizations as
“Neither”. Our discussion of the results focuses on the parent-identified adolescent race results presented in
Table 4a and repeated in the first column of Table 4b.
Of the 45 behaviors and outcomes, ceteris paribus, only five are clearly associated with black
adolescents, while 23 are associated with white adolescents, and the remaining 17 are not associated with either
monoracial group. Blacks are more likely to have engaged in sexual intercourse, to spend more hours watching
television, to spend more hours watching videos, and to spend more time playing video or computer games. One
outcome, which is more suggestive of a host of attendant behaviors rather than any one behavior (and of
particularly ambiguous causality), is that blacks are more likely to have been suspended from school during the
academic year. Predominantly white adolescent attitudes include believing that students at their school are
prejudiced, feeling close to other students at their school, feeling that teachers treat them fairly, and feeling
generally happy at school, skipping school, having difficulty paying attention in school, and completing their
homework. Whites are also more likely than blacks to engage in delinquent behaviors, including graffiti,
damaging property, and theft. Finally, whites are more likely than blacks to play sports, skate and “hang out”
with their friends.

6: Mixed-race identities implied by average behavior
To prepare for the second step of our analysis, we aggregate the white and black behaviors. Table 5
outlines our aggregation approach. We are most interested in three new indices: one of all white behaviors, one
of all black behaviors, and one combining them all. We also take an intermediate step for each of these three
aggregates because we have both dichotomous variables and frequency variables. To aggregate the
16

dichotomous variables we simply add them. To aggregate the frequency variables, we first rescale each
variable and then divide by its maximum value so that it ranges from 0 to 1. To combine the dichotomous and
rescaled frequency variables we add them. Note that higher values of our white indices indicate acting more
“white” while higher values of the black indices indicate acting more “black”. Thus before combining the black
variables and white variables, we subtract each black index from its theoretical maximum so that both the black
and white variables (when combined) have the same direction of black and white identity. As a result, higher
values of the combined white and black indices indicate acting more “white”.

Table 6 reports summary statistics for the indices described in Table 5, for all five of our samples. Each
samples’ indices’ components are defined based on that sample’s column in Table 4b or 4c. For example,
school_index is included in the “White” and “Aggregate” indices for the “all respondents” at-home sample
(the third column of Table 4b), but not in the other two at-home samples because the regression coefficient on
17

“black” is only significantly different from zero and negative in the “all respondents” regression, not in the
other two in-school sample regressions.
The summary statistics reported in Table 6 show two important general relationships between the
mixed-race populations and the monoracial populations. That is, although the mixed-race indices’ means are
closer to the white indices’ means than to the black indices’ means, yet the standard deviation of the mixed-race
population’s indices are generally larger than the black population’s standard deviation and smaller than the
white population’s standard deviation. We noted similar features in the separate behaviors’ means and standard
deviations in Table 2, and we will see it again in the regression residuals reported in the next section.
With these aggregate indices in hand, we are now ready for the second stage of our analysis, classifying
average mixed-race behavior in relationship to black and white monoracial behaviors. Table 7a reports
regressions of the indices from Table 6 on the same explanatory variables as were used to generate Tables 4a,
4b, and 4c. The estimated coefficients on the control variables are again omitted for clarity and this table
considers only our preferred sample (using parents’ identification to determine the adolescent’s identity). The
first trivial result (in the row “Type of behavior”) is to confirm that our aggregated indices maintain the
underlying statistical test of significance of the black indicator variable, as depicted in Figure 1. All indices of
white behaviors remain “white” types of behavior, all black index variables are “black” types of behavior, and
the combined indices indicate “white” behavior, as each one should.
The row in Table 7a that reports our substantive results at this stage is labeled “Identity”. Figure 2
describes the taxonomy and logic behind the “Identity” row, summarizing conditional average behavior of the
mixed-race sub-population. The classifications are based on an ordering of the coefficients "mixed and "black
relative to zero, as well as the statistical significance of their differences, implying seven possible “Identity”
outcomes. All coefficients and p-values are reported in Table 7a for our preferred sample. Table 7b reports
similar results for all five samples, without the coefficients and p-values.

Using p-values and signs of coefficients on the black and mixed indicator variables

18

Remembering that the excluded racial category is white adolescents, the easiest cases to explain in
Figure 2 are the first two from the left: “Black” and “White.” Mixed-race adolescents are engaging in typically
“Black” behaviors when the coefficient on the mixed-race indicator variable ("mixed) is statistically different
from zero but is not statistically different from the estimated coefficient on the black indicator variable ("black).
Mixed-race adolescents are engaging in typically “White” behaviors when the coefficient on mixed is not
different from zero and it is statistically different from the coefficient on the black indicator variable.
(Although we use a p-value of 0.10 as our cutoff, Table 7a shows that the p-values are seldom larger than 0.05
in our preferred sample, and this is true in the other samples as well.) The next three mixed-race behavioral
characteristics, moving from the left to the right in Figure 2, are identified by ordering zero and the two racial
coefficients "mixed and "black when all three are statistically different from each other. (The coefficient "black must
be different from zero given our construction of the index.) In the case of “Blacker-than-black”, the coefficient
on the black indicator variable is greater than zero and the coefficient on mixed is larger than the black
coefficient. In the case of “Whiter-than-white” behavior, the opposite ordering holds. We label the third case,
when mixed lies between zero and black, “Unique Combination”. The final two categories occur when the
mixed indicator variable is not individually statistically different from either zero or the black indicator
variable. If the joint F-test of these two null hypotheses is also not statistically significant, then we cannot
19

reject the hypothesis that mixed-race behavior is either black or white, the “Both” case. If the joint test is
statistically significant, then we have a result in which we can only say that average mixed-race behavior is
“Neither” black nor white.
The empirical results summarized in the “Identity” row of Table 7a indicate that mixed-race
adolescents’ behaviors are not easily characterized and that their identities may be in flux. Although the results
(in the first three columns) as regards “white” behaviors are not decisive for the frequency and dichotomous
indices separately, once the two indices are combined, we see that mixed-race adolescents on average adopt
white behaviors. The most robust result (in the second group of three columns) is that mixed-race youth follow
black behaviors with respect to those behaviors that are typically black. Once the “black” and “white” indices
are combined (in the last group of three columns,), the average behavior of mixed-race adolescents is
statistically different from both black and white adolescents, a convex combination of the two identities, not
behavior that is either “blacker than black” or “whiter than white”.
The “Identity” rows of Table 7b report results from all samples, first repeating the information from
Table 7a, our preferred sample in which adolescent race is determined by the parents’ races. Although race is
more likely endogenous to identity and behavior in the other four samples, we can use those additional samples
to investigate the robustness of our findings in our preferred sample. Interestingly, the two “Identity” rows that
are most different from the others are the second and third samples from the in-home survey. We can speculate
on two reasons for the discrepancy. Perhaps self-identification of race “whitens”, or it may be that we are losing
statistical significance in differentiation from the few black behaviors. Looking back at Table 1, we can find
support for both these assertions: Moving from parent-defined to self-defined mixed-race excludes 17 who selfidentify as black, 7 as white, and 13 as other (a total of 37), but includes only an additional 8 (5 with black
parents and 3 with white parents). So it may be that when mixed-race identification is endogenous to behavior,
those selecting into mixed-race are more likely to be comfortable with a white identity. But this argument loses
some force when considering the two in-school samples from Table 7b, because race is still self-identified but
we have much larger sample sizes. See also the summary statistics in Tables A1 and A2 for sample sizes (after
also including Wave 2 observations in the case of the in-home samples).
20

These five samples lend strong support to the result that the average behavior of mixed-race teens
generally follows a pattern of adopting both black and white behaviors. The result is a unique identity, one that
is different from both the average behavior of white teens and the average behavior of black teens (conditional
on our control measures, of course). This unique identity is a convex combination of the two identities, not
evidenced by behavior that is either “blacker than black” or “whiter than white”.

7: Variance in mixed-race individual identities implied by relative variance in behavior
As we noted earlier, an analysis of average behavior may conceal the fact that mixed-race individuals
are experimenting with a wider range of identities. Certainly the previous section’s discussion reveals
important characteristics of mixed-race identity, but we can add more to our understanding of individual
behavior by moving beyond a comparison of averages. To better understand the complexities of mixed-race
behavioral choices and identities, we now consider the variance in residual errors across the three racial groups,
comparing mixed-race adolescents to black and white adolescents in turn as well as comparing mixed-race
adolescents to the monoracial (either black or white) group as a whole. The test statistics for equality of
variance that we use are robust to non-normality, and we compute them using the robvar() command in
Stata® Version 10 (Brown and Forsythe 1974, Levene 1960). We use the several tests defined by those
authors, and the statistical significance of the differences in variance between the subgroups were generally
robust to the choice of statistical test.
Tables 7a and 7b summarize the results in the rows labeled “Differences in stdev”. The label “mix > b”
indicates, for example, that the variance in mixed-race adolescents’ behaviors is greater than the variance in
black adolescents’ behaviors, while “mix > mono” compares the variance of mixed-race adolescents’ behaviors
relative to the group composed of all monoracial adolescents. Only statistically significant differences are
reported. We again find evidence that mixed-race adolescents have less settled identities than do the
monoracial adolescents: There is more variation in behavior, and thus in definition of identity, among the
mixed-race adolescents, especially as compared to the black racial group. The intergroup differences in the

21

residual intragroup variances are again suggestive of a mixed-race group whose behavioral norms are less well
defined than for monoracial adolescents.

8: Concluding comments
In this research, we have expanded on the previous literature by considering the behavior and identity of
mixed-race youth, adding several important new methods and findings. We do not rely solely upon selfreported race but make use of parental identification as our preferred measure of racial group membership. We
also let the data determine which behaviors are black and which are white. The AddHealth survey allowed us to
consider a broad range of behaviors and outcomes from a nationally representative data set with a rich set of
control variables. Finally, we look at both average behavior and intragroup variance differences across the
racial categories to learn more about individuals’ choices.
Our results indicate that mixed-race youth act both white and black by adopting both types of behaviors,
those that can be empirically characterized as “black” and those that can be characterized as “white”. When we
combine both types of behavior, average mixed-race behavior is a combination that is neither white nor black,
and the variance in mixed-race behavior is generally greater than the variance in behavior of monoracial
adolescents, especially as compared to the black racial group.
We thus find that mixed-race identities are less well established, codified, or enforced than are
monoracial identities. Davis (1991) and Tizard and Phoenix (2002) provide anecdotal evidence supplied by
mixed-race youth that they resent the demands placed on them to exhibit a kind of racial loyalty by conforming
to prescribed norms and avoiding proscribed behaviors. In the terms of our theoretical model, both black and
white racial salience are high among the nationally-represented group of adolescents in the AddHealth data, but
the continued acceptance of the one-drop rule makes blackness somewhat more salient than whiteness. The
salience of black and white identities among mixed-race adolescents are manifested in the group’s conditional
average behavior. But the racial ambivalence reported by mixed-race youth to other researchers manifests itself
in our data as more highly variable intragroup behavior, measured by residual variance, as compared to
monoracial youths generally but especially as compared to the black group.
22

Given that adolescence is the time during which there is most pressure to establish an identity, and that
our results indicate that mixed-race youth are finding their own identities, not necessarily “joining” either
monoracial group, but in another sense joining both of them, one interpretation of our results is that multiracial
youth have the freedom to embrace both of their racial identities. We have found behaviors, providing evidence
of identities, that are more complex that those described in current interpretations of the “acting white”
hypothesis. The predominant application of “acting white” in the literature has been in the context of academic
achievement, and the next step in our research is to investigate the regularities we have uncovered here in that
more complex context.

23

Appendix: Samples in which the adolescent’s race is self-identified
Although our preferred sample provided a measure of identity that is arguably exogenous to students’
behaviors, it was necessarily limited to intact families. We then repeated our analyses, widening the sample to
include all families and using adolescents’ self-reported race. We first used the at-home data from Waves 1 and
2 which allows us to keep the same outcome variables, beginning with our sample of intact families but
switching the racial indentification from parents’ race(s) to the adolescent’s self identification (the sample size
falls slightly because there were some who didn’t choose either black or white but had parents who did), and
then expanding the sample by dropping the requirement that the adolescents be in intact families. The
summary statistics for these two samples’ dependent variables are reported in Table A1 and for their control
variables in Table A3, matching those in Table 3. We then consider the much larger sample of students from
the inschool survey, which was considerably shorter and did not ask many of the behavior questions that were
in that at-home Waves 1 and 2. Thus, we have no questions about sexual activity or drug use in Table A2’s
summary statistics of dependent variables. Even the set of explanatory variables is not identical as can be seen
in Table A4. We can only use the adolescent self-report of race(s) since the parent race data is not available for
the in-school sample. The two samples we create from the in-school data are for “intact” families and for all
respondents. (Given the structure of this questionnaire, we cannot be sure that the two parent families are intact
biological families, although we do at least delete those adolescents who report having been adopted.) Our
analysis proceeds with these samples as with the preferred sample. In particular, the “black” and “white”
behavior indices are constructed separately for each sample. Yet there is considerable agreement across
samples in the results of Tables 4b, 4c, and 7b.

Note: all models include the full set of control variables depicted in Table 3
The row "Type of behavior" summarizes the p-value above it and its associated coefficient.
The row "Identity" summarizes the p-values above it and their associated coefficients
The row "Differences in stdev" summarizes the standard deviations reported above only for significant differences (p-values not reported here).
"mix" = biracial subpopulation, "b" = black subpopulation, "w" = white subpopulation, "mono" = the black and the white subpopulations
