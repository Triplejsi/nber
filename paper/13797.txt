Optimal Provision of Multiple Excludable Public Goods

JEL No. H41
ABSTRACT
This paper studies the optimal provision mechanism for multiple excludable public goods when agents'
valuations are private information. For a parametric class of problems with binary valuations, we demonstrate
that the optimal mechanism involves bundling if a regularity condition, akin to a hazard rate condition,
on the distribution of valuations is satisfied. Bundling alleviates the free riding problem in large economies
in two ways: first, it may increase the asymptotic provision probability of socially efficient public
goods from zero to one; second, it decreases the extent of use exclusions. If the regularity condition
is violated, then the optimal solution replicates the separate provision outcome.

Introduction
This paper studies the optimal provision mechanism for multiple excludable public goods. We

brie‡y consider a somewhat more general setup where we obtain some characterization results, but
most of the paper focuses on a parametric version of the model where valuations are binary. In the
binary valuation case, we demonstrate that there is a considerable degree of bundling in the optimal
solution if a regularity condition, akin to a hazard rate condition, on the distribution of valuations
is satis…ed. If the regularity condition is violated, which happens when valuations are too strongly
positively correlated across goods, the optimal solution replicates the separate provision outcome.
To motivate the importance of a better understanding of bundling of non-rival goods, we note
that many goods that are provided in bundles are close to fully non-rival. The most striking example
is the access to electronic libraries, for which the typical contractual arrangement is a site license
that allows access to every issue of every journal in the electronic library. Another example is
cable TV, where the basic pricing scheme consists of a limited number of available packages. Other
examples include computer software and digital music …les. For several of these cases, the pros and
cons of bundling for the consumer have been frequently debated by the media, legal scholars, and
in the courtroom. Still, there is no normative benchmark that explicitly considers the non-rival
nature of these goods in the economics literature.
We consider a model with M excludable public goods, meaning that all goods are fully non-rival,
but consumers can be excluded from usage. Each consumer is characterized by a valuation for each
good, and the willingness to pay for a subset of goods is the sum of the individual good valuations.
In addition, the cost of provision for each good is independent of which other goods are provided.
Under these separability assumptions, the …rst best benchmark is to provide good j if and only
if the sum of valuations for good j over all consumers exceeds its provision cost and to exclude
no consumer from usage. Under perfect information, there is thus no role for either bundling
or use exclusions. However, when preferences are private information, consumers must be given
appropriate incentives to truthfully reveal their willingness to pay. Together with self-…nancing and
participation constraints, it is then impossible to implement the (non-bundling) perfect information
social optimum. Bundling is then potentially useful because it improves possibilities to extract
surplus from the consumers, which will then relax a binding constraint on the problem.
The …rst part of the paper considers a relatively general setup, and characterizes the form
of optimal provision mechanisms in symmetric environments. We then apply these results in the
special case with binary valuations for which we obtain an exact characterization of the constrained
e¢ cient mechanism. To make the problem tractable, we impose symmetry conditions on costs and
type distributions in addition to the restriction that valuations take on only two values for each of
the M excludable public goods.
The solution to the problem is rather striking. When the economy is large in the sense that

1

the number of consumers goes to in…nity, the optimal mechanism will either provide all goods
with probability close to one, or provide all goods with probability close to zero. Which of the
two scenarios applies depends on whether or not a monopolist pro…t maximizer that provides the
goods for sure could break even. If a regularity condition, akin to a hazard rate condition, on
the distribution of valuations is satis…ed, the optimal mechanism also prescribes a very simple rule
for user access to the public goods once they are provided. All consumers will fall into one of
three groups: the …rst group, consisting of those whose numbers of goods for which they have
high valuations strictly exceed a threshold, will be given access to the grand bundle consisting of
all goods; the second group, consisting of those whose number of goods for which they have high
valuations are strictly lower than the threshold, will be given access to only those goods for which
they have a high valuation; the third group, consisting of those with exactly the threshold-level
number of high valuation goods, will always be given access to their high valuation goods, and will
also be given access to their low valuation goods with some probability. Note that the third group
of consumers for which some randomization is applied will be quite rare when there are many public
goods, i.e., as M gets large.
For the special case with two goods we solve the problem also for the case where the regularity
condition discussed above is violated. With two goods, the regularity condition is violated when the
valuations are too positively correlated. This invalidates the standard approach to solve screening
problems using only downwards adjacent constraint, as there are simply too few “mixed types”
(those with one high and one low valuation) to justify giving them a better treatment than the type
with two low valuations. We show that the optimal solution in fact is identical to the solution when
both goods must be provided separately. It is interesting to relate this to the seminal contribution
by Adams and Yellen [1]. Their explanation of bundling was that the monopolist seller knows
more about the willingness to pay for the bundle than for the components provided that there is
negative correlation. It has been shown that the relevant comparison is the willingness to pay for
the components versus the willingness to pay for the average, implying that essentially the same
explanation also works when valuations are independent.1 Our result here shows that this logic
falls apart when valuations are too positively correlated.
The analytical tractability for the multidimensional mechanism design problem in our paper
comes from exploiting some important similarities to unidimensional problems. In particular, in the
unidimensional case, it is known that maximizing social surplus subject to budget and participation constraints leads to a Lagrangian characterization which can be interpreted as a compromise
between pro…t and welfare maximization (see Hellwig [10] and Norman [17]). In our model we
cannot collapse the constraints to a single integral constraint, but we are able to use the optimality conditions to link the values of the multipliers associated with various constraints so that the
optimal solution can be understood analogously.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the model and some
characterization results. Section 3 introduces the special case when valuations are binary and
derives the optimal mechanism in the regular case. In Section 4 we use some special cases to better
interpret the characterization in Section 3, in particular, we characterize the optimal mechanism for
the two good case when the regularity condition is violated. Section 5 contains a brief discussion
of the relevance of our analysis with respect to concrete anti-trust issues. Appendix A contains all
the proofs of results in Section 3.2

The Model
This section lays out a fairly general model (Section 2.1). The set of randomized direct mech-

anisms is represented in a somewhat nonstandard (but useful) way (Section 2.2), before we set up
the mechanism design problem (Section 2.3). We then gradually show, sometimes with additional
restrictions on the environment, that it is without loss of generality to consider a smaller and more
tractable class of simple, anonymous and symmetric mechanisms (Sections 2.4 and 2.5). The main
results of this section are Propositions 1 and 2, which are used in later Sections to reduce the
dimensionality of the design problem.

2.1

The Environment

There are M excludable public goods, labeled by j 2 J = f1; :::; M g and n consumers, indexed

by i 2 I = f1; :::; ng. Each public good is indivisible, and the cost of providing good j, denoted

C j (n), is independent of which of the other goods are provided. Since n is the number of consumers
in the economy, not the number of user s, all goods are fully non-rival. The rationale for indexing

cost by n is to be able to analyze large economies without making the public goods a “free lunch”
in the limit. We therefore allow for the existence of cj > 0 such that limn!1 C j (n) =n = cj > 0.
There is no need to give this assumption any economic interpretation. It is best viewed as a way
to ensure that the provision problem remains “signi…cant” with a large number of agents.
Consumer i is described by a valuation for each good j 2 J ; so that her type is given by a

vector

i

RM : Agent i has preferences represented by the utility function,

where Iji is a dummy variable taking value 1 when i consumes good j and 0 otherwise, and ti is
the quantity of the numeraire good transferred from i to the mechanism designer. Preferences over
lotteries are of expected utility form.
The type

i

is private information to the agent. While we allow valuations across goods to be

correlated for the individual, it is essential that we assume independence across agents. We denote

Randomized Direct Mechanisms

An outcome in our environment has three components: (1). Which goods, if any, should be
provided; (2). Who are to be given access to the goods that are provided; and (3). How to share
the costs. The set of feasible pure outcomes is thus

By the revelation principle, we restrict attention to direct mechanisms for which truth-telling is
a Bayesian Nash equilibrium. A pure direct mechanism is a map from

n

to A: We represent

a randomized mechanism in analogy with the representation of mixed strategies in Aumann [5].
That is, let

[0; 1] ; and think of # 2

as the outcome of a …ctitious lottery, where, without

loss of generality, # is uniformly distributed and independent of : A random direct mechanism
is then a measurable mapping G :

n

! A. A conceptual advantage of this representation

is that it allows for a useful decomposition. That is, we may write G as a (2M + 1)-tuple, G =

i(

is the cost-

) is the transfer from agent i to the mechanism designer given announced

valuation pro…le . In principle, transfers could also be random, but the pure cost-sharing rule in
(3) is without loss of generality due to risk neutrality.

A mechanism is incentive feasible if it satis…es (IC), (BB) and (IR). Utility is transferable, implying
that constrained ex ante Pareto e¢ cient allocations may be characterized by solving a utilitarian

planning problem, where a …ctitious social planner seeks to maximize total surplus in the economy,
subject to the constraints (IC), (BB) and (IR).4 Thus a mechanism is thus constrained e¢ cient if
it maximizes

any agent from usage, which is the same rule as the …rst best rule for a single public good. This is
implementable if and only if a non-excludable public good can be e¢ ciently provided under (IC),
(BB) and (IR). (See Mailath and Postlewaite [17].) Our setup is thus a second best problem.
3

As shown in Borgers and Norman [9] it is without loss of generality to consider a resource constraint in ex ante

form. Given independence and two or more agents, transfers can be adjusted so as to satisfy ex post budget balance
without changing the interim expected payo¤ for any individual.
4
The quali…er ex ante is crucial for the equivalence. See Ledyard and Palfrey [18] for a characterization of interim
e¢ ciency.
5
All these constraints are noncontroversial if the design problem is interpreted as a private bargaining agreement.
If the goods are government provided, the participation constraints (IR) may seem questionable. One defense in this
context is that the participation constraint is a reduced form of an environment where agents may vote with their
feet. Another defense is to view this as a reduced form for inequality aversion of the planner. See Hellwig [15].

Simple Anonymous Mechanisms

To simplify the analysis, we …rst exploit the symmetry, as well as the linearity, of the constraints
and the objective function. This allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the problem:
De…nition 1 A mechanism is called a simple mechanism if it can be expressed as (2M + 1)-tuple

is the inclusion rule for good j (same for all agents),

and t is the transfer rule (also same for all agents).
There are a number of simpli…cations in (5) relative to (3). First, inclusion and transfer rules
j

are the same for all agents; second, conditional on ; the provision probability

( ) is stochasti-

cally independent from all other provision probabilities, and all inclusion probabilities; third, the
inclusion and transfer rules for any agent i are independent of the realization of

i;

and fourth,

all agents are treated symmetrically in terms of the transfer and inclusion rules. But (5) allows
provision rules to treat agents asymmetrically. We therefore need a de…nition to express what it
means for the name of an agent to be irrelevant:

We now show that focusing on simple anonymous mechanisms is without loss of generality:
Proposition 1 For any incentive feasible mechanism G of the form (3), there exists a simple

anonymous incentive feasible mechanism g of the form (5) that generates the same social surplus.

The idea is roughly that risk neutral agents care only about the perceived probability of consuming each good and the expected transfer. Therefore, there is nothing to gain from conditioning
transfers and inclusion probabilities on

i,

or by making inclusion and provision rules condition-

ally dependent. Mechanisms of the form (5) are therefore su¢ cient. Moreover, given an incentive
feasible mechanism, permuting the roles of the agents leaves the surplus unchanged and all constraints satis…ed. An anonymous incentive feasible mechanism that generates the same surplus as
the initial mechanism can therefore be obtained by averaging over the n! permuted mechanisms.6
6

The actual proof is a bit more complex than simply randomizing with equal probabilities over the n! permutations.

The reason is that inclusion and provision probabilities are potentially correlated.

2.5

Symmetric Treatment of the Goods

Our next result, on which we rely heavily in Sections 3 and 4, identi…es conditions under which
it is without loss of generality to treat goods symmetrically. Obviously, the underlying environment
must be symmetric, and we formalize this by assuming that
random variable, that is F ( i ) = F

In de…ning a symmetric mechanism, the same permutation of goods must be applied for all
agents. As an example, suppose that there are two agents and two goods, and that the valuation
for each good is either h or l: In this case
= ( 1;

= ((h; l) ; (l; h)) 2

= f(h; h) ; (h; l) ; (l; h) ; (l; l)g. Consider the type pro…le

Applying the only non-identity permutation of the goods, i.e.,

P (1) = 2 and P (2) = 1; to all agents generates a type pro…le

P

=

P P
1; 2

= ((l; h) ; (h; l)) :

De…nition 3 requires that the allocations for type pro…le ((l; h) ; (h; l)) is the same as the allocation
for ((h; l) ; (l; h)) with goods relabeled, and that transfers are unchanged.7 The result is:
Proposition 2 Suppose that
that

Cj

i

is an exchangeable random variable and that there exists C (n) such

(n) = C (n) for all j 2 J : Then, for any simple anonymous incentive feasible mechanism

g; there exists a simple anonymous and symmetric incentive feasible mechanism that generates the
same surplus as g:
The idea is similar to that of Proposition 1, except that it is the identities of the goods that
are permuted. Consider the case with two goods, and suppose that the two goods are treated
7

If we were to apply di¤erent permutations for the two agents, e.g., applying the identity permutation for agent

1 and the non-identiy permutation for agent 2, then we would obtain a pro…le ((h; l) ; (h; l)), which is a qualitatively
di¤erent from either ((h; l) ; (l; h)) or ((l; h) ; (h; l)) : In the pro…le ((h; l) ; (h; l)) ; both agents have low valuations for
good 2 and high valuations for good 1, whereas, in the pro…les ((h; l) ; (l; h)) or ((l; h) ; (h; l)) ; one and only one agent
has high valuation for both goods.

7

asymmetrically. Reversing the role of the goods, an alternative mechanism that generates the same
surplus is obtained. Averaging over the original and the reversed mechanism creates a symmetric
mechanism where surplus is unchanged.8 Incentive feasibility of the new mechanism follows from
incentive feasibility of the original mechanism. Proposition 2 generalizes this procedure by permuting the goods (M ! possibilities) and creating a symmetric mechanism by averaging over these
permuted mechanisms.

notationally convenient to impose these additional symmetry restrictions at a later stage. As such, we are indexing

The Relaxed Optimization Problem

Guided by intuition based on unidimensional mechanism design problems, we will now formulate
a relaxed problem where all incentive constraints in (8) except the downwards adjacent incentive
constraints are removed. The relaxed problem is fully described below in (11). Analogous to the
standard approach in unidimensional problems, we will show in Lemma 12 below that this provides
a valid solution to the full problem when the solution to the relaxed problem is monotonic in the
following sense:

We will next state a sequence of intermediate results that will be used to characterize the solution
to (11) and, eventually, the full problem in (7).

3.2

Relating the Multipliers

First, a standard argument based on compactifying the constraint set assures that there are
solutions to the relaxed optimization problem:
Lemma 1 There exists at least one optimal solution to (11).
Next, we use the general symmetry result in Proposition 2 to show that the value of a multiplier
for any of the downwards adjacent incentive constraint (12) depends only on the number of goods
for which the consumer has a high valuation.
Lemma 2 It is without loss of generality to assume that for every m 2 f1; :::; M g there exists some
(m)

i

2

0 such that

(m) is the multiplier associated with every constraint (12) applicable for every

with m ( i ) = m:

Hence,

(m) denotes the multiplier for all downwards adjacent incentive constraints for types

with m

1 high valuations. We also let (0) denote the participation constraint for type l = (l; :::; l)

and let

denote the value of the multiplier for the resource constraint (14).

We now show that the multipliers

(m) ; m 2 f0; :::; M g and

type for which agent i has a high valuation for m 2 f0; ::::; M
ways to replace a coordinate in
of

0
i

i

are closely linked. Let

i

be a

1g goods. There are m di¤erent

that corresponds to a high valuation. Also, there are M

that can be “turned into” type

i

m types

by replacing a single high valuation with a low valuation.

10

As a result of these observations, we have that the optimality conditions to the program (11) with
respect to ti ( i ) are given by
(m) m + (m + 1) (M
whereas the optimality condition for

i

m

=

i ( i)

= 0;

(15)

= h = (h; ::::; h) is
(M ) +

Using the identity

m) +

M!
m!(M m)! i ( i ) ;

i (h)

=0

(16)

and the di¤erence equation de…ned by (15) and (16), we

obtain:
Lemma 3 For every m 2 f0; :::; M g the value of

is de…ned in (6).

A rough intuition for Lemma 3 is that if the designer could extract an extra unit of surplus
from types with m high valuations without upsetting any constraints, then an extra unit could be
obtained from all higher types as well because only the di¤erence in the transfers are relevant for
the (adjacent downwards) incentive constraints. This explains why the value of the multipliers are
proportional to the probability that the number of valuations exceeds m:

3.3

Inclusion Rules

Next, we will show that the solution has the intuitively plausible (but non-obvious) property
that exclusions are only used for goods for which the agent has low valuations.
Lemma 4 Suppose that
Then,

j

( i ) = 1 in any optimal solution to

j
i

= h and that

(11):12

P

i2

i

i(

j

( i;

i)

> 0:

At …rst blush, Lemma 4 may appear like a “no distortion at the top result.” However, this is
not the case because it says that a consumer should be given access to her high valuation goods
irrespective of her total number of goods with high valuations. Instead, the result is best understood
in terms of the relationship between the multipliers in (15). Providing a high valuation good to a
type with m high valuations relaxes the downwards adjacent incentive constraints (12) for every
12

The condition

P

objective function or the constraints when the conditional probability of provision is zero, but, one may of course set

( i ) = 1 also in this case.

type with exactly m high valuations. There are m such incentive constraints, so the increased
utility from truth-telling for these types is

(m) mh: However, giving access to the high valuation

good j does make it more tempting for a type with m + 1 high valuations to announce only m high
valuations. There are M

m ways to change one coordinate into a lie with m high valuations,

so the decreased utility from announcing a type with one of the other coordinates changed from h
to l is

(m + 1) (M

m) h: It is then immediate from (15) that the positive e¤ect from making

truth-telling more appealing always dominates, thus all consumers always get access to the high
valuation goods.

To interpret (18) and Lemma 5, we …rst notice that (M

m) l

m

is the (positive) e¤ect on

social welfare if the inclusion rule changes so as to give access to the low valuation goods for all
consumers with exactly m high valuations. To understand the second term in (18), consider the
expected revenue for the provider if she gives consumers with m or more high valuations full access
to all the goods, and the remaining consumers access to only their high valuation goods. Under
the above access policy, the provider can charge mh + (M

m) l to the group of consumers who

consume all goods; and charge h per good to the remaining consumers who only obtain access
to their high valuation goods. Assuming that all goods would be provided for sure, the expected
revenue under the above access and pricing policy is then be given by

Thus the second term in (18) is the (positive or negative) e¤ect on pro…ts from allowing a consumer
with m high valuations to consume also her low valuation goods. We conclude that we may interpret
the constrained welfare optimization as maximizing a weighted average of welfare and pro…ts, with
weights on pro…ts increasing with the multiplier

associated with the resource constraint (14).

This property has been shown in unidimensional settings (see Hellwig [14] and Norman [23]), where
incentive feasibility can be characterized by a single constraint using methods from Myerson [21],
but to the best of our knowledge, no analogous result directly applicable for our multidimensional
setting has been shown in the literature.

3.4

Provision Rules

We are now in a position to characterize the optimal provision rule. To do this transparently,
it is useful to …rst denote H j ( ; m) as the number of agents with a high valuation for good j and
m high valuations in total under the type pro…le

= ( 1 ; :::;

n ).

Symmetrically, we let Lj ( ; m)

denote the the number of agents with a low valuation for good j and m high valuations in total
under type pro…le : The solution to the relaxed problem can now be characterized rather sharply
in terms of the multiplier of the resource constraint only:

(21)

Just like the optimal inclusion rule, (21) may be understood as a compromise between welfare
maximization and pro…t maximization. To see this, …rst note the fact that all high valuation agents
P
j
consume the good for sure conditional on provision implies that M
m=1 H ( ; m) h is the surplus
from all consumers with a high valuation for good j: Next, recall that Gm ( ) had the interpretation

as the e¤ect from giving an agent with m high valuations access to all the goods for which the
agent has a low valuation. However, in order to get the surplus from the low valuation agents in
P
1
j
the same units as M
m=1 H ( ; m) h in (21), we need to rescale Gm ( ) by
(M m) : The reason
m

for

1

m

is as follows. The inclusion rules involves a trade-o¤ between the possibility that an agent
13

jj

)

h

mm

has exactly m high valuations (with probability
P
valuations exceed m (with probability M
j=m+1

m)

and the probability that the number of high

j ).

In contrast, the natural unit for the welfare

created by providing good j is for a …xed ; implying that we need to scale up Gm ( ) by

1
m

. In

addition, as all goods are treated symmetrically, the marginal e¤ect of changing the inclusion rule
is to provide access to M

m goods. In contrast, providing a good only gives the agents a single

extra good on the margin. This di¤erence is what accounts for the scaling factor

1
M m

in (21).

Hence, the …rst two terms may be thought of as the e¤ect from provision on a combination of social
welfare and revenue, whereas the …nal term obviously is the associated cost of provision.

3.5

Su¢ cient Conditions for the Solution to the Relaxed Problem (11) To Solve
the Full Problem (7)

We will now discuss when the solution to the relaxed problem (11) also solves the full problem
(7). Many steps in this analysis are similar to Matthews and Moore [19], but the multidimensional
nature of our environment leads to some important di¤erences.
If the mechanism is monotonic in the sense of De…nition 5, we show that, the diagonal constraints are irrelevant (Lemma 7) and that all downwards (upwards) constraints are implied by the
downwards adjacent (upwards adjacent) constraints (Lemma 8 and 9 respectively):
Lemma 7 Suppose that ( ; ; t) is monotonic and that all downwards and upwards incentive constraints hold. Then, all incentive constraints in (7) are satis…ed.
Lemma 8 Suppose that ( ; ; t) is monotonic and that all downwards adjacent incentive constraints
hold. Then, all downwards constraints in (7) are satis…ed.
Lemma 9 Suppose that ( ; ; t) is monotonic and that all upwards adjacent incentive constraints
hold. Then, all upwards constraints in (7) are satis…ed.
A qualitative di¤erence in the way downwards and upwards adjacent constraints are dealt with
is that the latter may possibly be violated at the optimal solution to (11). However, should the
downwards adjacent constraint bind, then it follows that the upwards adjacent constraints are all
satis…ed:
Lemma 10 Suppose that ( ; ; t) is such that the downwards adjacent constraints in (11) bind.
Then all upwards adjacent incentive constraints in (7) are satis…ed.
Combing the results above, we have that the solution to the relaxed problem is also a solution
to the full problem provided that the downwards adjacent incentive constraints bind and that the
solution to the relaxed problem is monotonic. We therefore need conditions for when this is true
in the optimal solution to the relaxed problem (11). As a …rst step we establish that monotonicity
guarantees that the constraints bind.
14

Lemma 11 Let ( ; ; t) be an optimal solution to (11). If ( ; ; t) is monotonic and is not ex post
e¢ cient, then every downwards adjacent incentive constraint and the participation constraint for
type l = (l; :::; l) bind.
The basic idea behind Lemma 11 is obvious: if there is slack in a constraint, one can increase
inclusions or the probability of provision. However, the actual proof is a little bit more subtle
because the inclusion and provision probabilities may already be at their upper bound for the
particular

i

where there is slack. To deal with this possibility we instead extract some additional

cash from type

i:

An inductive argument shows that this additional cash can be used to improve

the allocation unless the solution is already ex post e¢ cient.
We can now combine these preliminary results and provide a characterization of when the
solution to the relaxed problem solves the full problem.
Lemma 12 Let ( ; ; t) be an optimal solution to (11). If ( ; ; t) is monotonic and is not ex post
e¢ cient, then ( ; ; t) is also an optimal solution to the full problem (7).
Finally, we derive useful su¢ cient conditions for the conditions in Lemma 12 to be ful…lled:
Lemma 13 Let ( ; ; t) be a solution to (11). Then,
( ; ; t) is monotonic if

Moreover, a su¢ cient condition for

is that the valuations for any goods j and

6= j are independent.

The condition is almost, but not quite, a hazard rate condition, where the term M

m makes

the condition diverge from a simple hazard rate condition. Intuitively, the explanation of the
“almost hazard rate condition” is that we are either providing access to all goods or only to the
goods for which the agent has high valuations. Allowing access to all goods is better in terms of
social surplus, but may reduce the revenue raised. More precisely, with probability

m

a consumers

has exactly m high valuations, and such a consumer will be willing to pay (M

m) l more if he
PM
is given access to the low valuation goods. On the other hand, with probability j=m+1 j the
number of highPvaluations exceed m, and for such a consumer the revenue is reduced by (h

The Main Result

Now we provide our main result regarding the limit of the sequences of optimal solutions to
(11) as the number of agents n goes out of bounds. We will henceforth index mechanisms by the
number of agents n when needed.
The rationale for considering such sequences is that it allows us to take limits of exact solutions
to our optimization problems, to obtain a more easily interpretable characterization of the solutions
when n is large. The key advantage of considering a large population limit is that it allows us to
use a version of the “Paradox of Voting”–for large n; it is almost as if the provision rule is constant
in type announcements –which tremendously simpli…es the description of the optimal mechanism.
Formally, we can use the Central Limit Theorem to establish:
Lemma 15 Let ( n ; n ; tn ) be a solution to the constrained welfare problem (11). Then, E

and inclusion rules in the limit as n goes to in…nity is given as follows:

The proof of Proposition 3 requires quite a bit of technical work. Still, the key idea is rather
simple. Once we have established that the solution must have a threshold characterization (Lemma
14), and that the in‡uence of any individual agent’s announcement vanishes as the number of agents
goes to in…nity, it is quite clear that we want to set the threshold as low as possible, subject to
the constraint that provision must be self-…nancing. The condition on whether maxm R (m)

cM

is positive thus will dictate whether there will be su¢ cient budget to provide all the public goods.
Most work in the proof goes into establishing that a large economy is approximately like an economy
where the provision decisions are made ex ante, not conditioning on : The intuition for this is that
the larger the economy is, the more certain we can be that the economy is close to the expected.

Special Cases and Implications

4.1

One Good or Independent Provision

When there are no complementarities in preferences and production costs, it is clear that the
analysis of providing a single excludable public good is the same as the analysis of the case where
M goods are provided by independent agencies. Also, the case when valuations for di¤erent goods
are perfectly correlated is also equivalent to the case with a single good.
P
m
Let = M
m=1 M m denote the (marginal) probability that a consumer has a high willingness
to pay for any particular good. With only a single good, the condition that

1

M m

is

decreasing in m is satis…ed by default, thus Proposition 3 is always applicable. Furthermore,
(
l
if m = 0
R (m) =
h if m = 1:
Hence, Proposition 3 says that limn!1 E

c < 0:

The case with l

n(

) = 0 if max fl; hg

c < 0; and limn!1 E

n(

c is trivial: if the low valuation exceeds the cost of provision, it is …rst best

e¢ cient to always provide and never exclude any consumers from usage, which can be implemented
by a uniform user fee of c: When l < c < h; we know from Proposition 3 that the probability for
access for type l goods converges to

which interestingly is exactly the same provision rule as the one that would be optimal for a pro…tmaximizing monopolist; thus for the one good case, the welfare loss associated with a for-pro…t
monopolist relative to the constrained social optimum is only due to over-exclusion, not in underprovision. With more than one good, there is typically under-provision by a for-pro…t monopolistic
provider for …nite n:

4.2

Two Goods

Here we describe the results for the two-good case, which was the focus of Fang and Norman [12].
The two-good case is also interesting because we can also characterize the optimal mechanism
when the regularity condition is violated (the characterization for that case is provided in the next
subsection).

It is worth emphasizing that in the optimal joint provision mechanism, both goods will be
provided with probability one asymptotically if max f(

separately, but the optimal bundling mechanism provides both goods for sure.
The increased provision probability for e¢ cient public goods under a bundling mechanism relative to the separate provision mechanism is only one channel through which bundling may increase
e¢ ciency. The optimal bundling mechanism also leads to strict e¢ ciency gains relative the nonbundling mechanism by increasing the probability of inclusion for low-valuation agents, even in cases
when the goods can also be provided without bundling. To see this, suppose that

h > c so that

both public goods will be asymptotically provided with probability one with or without bundling.
From (22), we know that under the best separate provision mechanism, the probability for access to
a low valuation agent is ( h

c) = ( h

The interesting aspect of Proposition 4 is that the solution is identical to the case when
bundling is not allowed. To understand why, recall that asymptotic provision or non-provision
is related to whether the maximal revenue for a monopolistic provider of the goods – if provided
– exceeds the costs. The revenue maximizing selling strategy for a monopolist, if both public
goods are provided, is either to sell goods separately at price h; or sell the goods as a bundle
at price h + l, or to charge l for each good. These selling strategies generate a revenue of 2 h;
(

whether max f(

For the second part of Proposition 4, consider the case when either separate provision or

Conclusion and Discussion
This paper studies the optimal provision mechanism for multiple excludable public goods when

agents’valuations are private information. For a parametric class of problems with M goods whose
valuations take binary values, we fully characterize the optimal mechanism and demonstrate that
it involves bundling if a regularity condition, akin to a hazard rate condition, on the distribution of
valuations is satis…ed. Bundling alleviates the free riding problem in large economies in two ways:
20

…rst, it may increase the asymptotic provision probability of socially e¢ cient public goods from
zero to one; second, it decreases the extent of use exclusions. For the case of two goods, we also
show that if the regularity condition is violated, then the optimal solution replicates the separate
provision outcome.
Our Model as a Positive Theory of Bundling.

Bundled discounts are common in many

markets. In fact, some have argued that almost any commodity is best viewed as a bundle of
characteristics.13 However, once we take a narrower perspective of only considering bundles of
commodities that are viable “stand-alone goods” in the sense that a consumer has a substantial
willingness to pay for each component even if no other goods in the bundle are consumed, it is
arguable that commonly bundled commodities mostly have non-rival properties, or, more generally,
goods with a substantial …xed costs. Software, music, electronic libraries, and TV programming
are obvious examples, and these kinds of goods are growing more important. As such, our paper
may be interpreted as a positive theory of bundling of goods with no-rival properties.
It is worth noting that in this paper we focused on the harder problem of maximizing social
welfare instead of maximizing pro…ts; but the pro…t-maximizing selling strategy is a by-product of
our analysis. It is easy to see that the only change in the asymptotic characterization of the pro…tmaximizing selling mechanism is that the threshold number of high valuation goods a consumer
needs in order to get access to her low valuation goods will increase. Or, put di¤erently, the price
of the grand bundle will be higher than in Proposition 3 because a pro…t-maximizing monopolist
will seek as high a pro…t as possible rather than to only break even. The rest of Proposition 3 is
unchanged for the pro…t-maximization problem.
The key di¤erence between our model of bundling for non-rival goods and the standard bundling
model for private goods with constant unit costs is that the decision for whether to provide a good
becomes non-trivial. This in turn makes it necessary to go beyond the standard setup with a single
consumer. As a result the characterization of the optimal selling mechanism in our setup is more
complicated when there is a …nite number of consumers.
A Regulatory Benchmark for Bundling of Goods with Large Fixed Costs.

Bundling

may under some circumstances violate current U.S. anti-trust legislation; indeed the legality and
desirability of bundling of software (a non-rival good) have been a critical point of debate in several
recent cases. While economists have been involved in this discussion, to the best of our knowledge
there is not yet a clear-cut normative benchmark in the economics literature. The analysis in this
paper is a small step towards the development of a useful normative benchmark for bundling in
natural monopoly situations.
13

For example, a car can be considered as a “bundle” consisting of a chassis, an engine, cup holders, a stereo

system, air conditioning etc.

21

Though our model is highly stylized, it has enough ‡exibility to generate a non-trivial trade-o¤.
On the one side, it is a possible that bundling is required for the monopolist to break even. In
this case the pro…t-maximizing outcome with bundling is better for the consumer than the welfare
maximizing outcome without bundling; thus a requirement to “unbundle” is strictly worse for the
consumers, regardless of other budget-balancing remedies that may be combined with the decision
to unbundle.14 On the other side, the fact that bundling makes it easier for the monopolist to
extract consumer surplus can make consumers worse o¤ for the obvious reasons.
Our model still makes many restrictive assumptions on the cost and preference side. In particular, while the assumption that preferences exhibit no complementarities highlights the role of
bundling as a screening instrument, it is counter-factual in many cases. Moreover, arguments based
on alleged complementarities are often used to justify bundling. However, it should be rather clear
that in itself, complementarities are not su¢ cient to provide a rationale for bundling: if many
consumers like to consume a particular computer program jointly with their computer, they may
choose to do so regardless of whether the computer program is bundled with the computer.15 Even
though the argument that “bundling is good for the customer because the customers like the goods
together”is suspect, complementarities in preferences may matter if combined with some other potential justi…cation for bundling, such as the considerations about …xed costs of the current paper.
We intend to study this question in future research.

Indeed, for computers bought on the internet, the buyer already has a long array of options on how to customize
the computer, and it would be easy to allow the consumer to opt out of the standard software bundle (a choice which
is usually not available).

ti (l)

ti ( i jlk )

m ( i ) h + [M

m ( i )] l < M h. Recursive application

of (12) therefore implies that we may bound ti ( i ) from above by M 2 h: Since this is also an upper
bound for the di¤erence between ti ( i ) and ti ( i jlk ) ; it follows from (14) that we may bound ti ( i )
M 2 h: Hence, existence of a solution to (11) follows from Weierstrass maximum

from below by

We note that ti ( i ) enters in Term A for m conditions: there are m ways to manipulate a single
coordinate so as to announce a pro…le with one h replaced with a l: From Lemma 2, the multiplier
associated with each of these conditions is (m) : In addition, ti ( i ) enters in Term B for M m
downwards incentive constraints for types with m + 1 high valuations. Finally, it also enters the
resource constraint (14). The …rst order condition with respect to ti ( i ) can thus be written as

where we used (6) for the …rst equality.
For m = M; condition (A2) reads M (M ) =

m = M: Now suppose that (m) is given by the expression in (17) for some m

(Proof of Lemma 11, continued:) Since we assume that ( ; ; t) is not ex post e¢ cient, it must be
the case that (n 1)h > nc. Otherwise, the ex post optimal mechanism is either to implement
if and only if ji = h for all i (when (n 1) h < nc < nh), or to never provide any good (when
32

nh
nc). In each of these two cases, the ex post optimal mechanism is trivially implementable
under the constraints in (11). We therefore assume that (n 1)h > nc in the remainder of the
proof. If a downwards adjacent incentive constraint does not bind, there exists some i such that

(

> 0 for every j: Hence, the value of

the objective function increases, which contradicts the assumption that ( ; ; t) is an optimum
in the …rst place. Suppose instead that ji ( i jlk ) = 1: Then, we can …nd some " > 0 and raise
the tax to e
ti ( i ) = ti ( i ) + " for i and every 0i with m 0i = m ( i ) : This raises some extra

revenue, implying that the taxes can be lowered slightly for some other types without upsetting
the resource constraint. We can therefore proceed inductively as follows. First consider types

there are no active use of exclusions in the solution. However, as we have slack in the resource

unless the solution to (11) is the

ex post optimal rule.
Proof of Lemma 12.
Proof. By Lemma 7, all “diagonal” incentive constraints hold, and by Lemma 8 all downwards
constraints hold. By Lemma 11 we have that all downwards adjacent incentive constraints bind,
which, by use of Lemma 10 assures that the upwards adjacent incentive constraints hold. Finally,
Lemma 9 guarantees that all upwards incentive constraints hold. Taken together, we have then
veri…ed that all incentive constraints in (7) hold if the solution to the relaxed problem is monotonic
and di¤erent from the …rst best.
Proof of Lemma 13.

allows us to use the central limit theorem to establish a “generalized paradox of voting”, which
simply states the intuitively obvious fact that the in‡uence of a single agent approaches zero as the
number of agents goes out of bounds. To state this, we will now need to be careful about the fact
that the solution depends on the number of agents in the economy, and a mechanism with n agents
will therefore now be denoted by (

n ; n ; tn )

e is the threshold number of high goods

of converging subsequence. We use the following notations below:
h

E jn ( ) jm; ji = h denotes the conditional provision probability for good j perceived by
agent i given that

k

= h for exactly m goods k 2 J (including j). Notice that

this probability is the same for all goods by Proposition 2.

E jn ( ) j m; ji = l denotes the conditional provision probability for good j perceived by

the same for all goods by Proposition 2.

cM < 0 and an argument identical with part 1

2. Suppose that m

h
establishes that limn!1 E jn ( ) ! 0.

3. Suppose that m

0: Then, the expression in (A34) is strictly
i
h
j
positive and limn!1 E n ( ) ! 1: The social surplus must therefore converge towards the
same expression as in (A32), but with m replaced by m : But, if m

smaller because there are more exclusions.

that:
Lemma A1 Consider m = 2: Then, there are three possibilities in the solution to the program

where the last equality follows from (B10). Hence the surplus generated by g is identical to that

because (see the second line in (B12)) all the permuted mechanisms satisfy participation constraints.
Proposition 1 follows by combining Claims B1 and B2.
