ABSTRACT
We propose a new model of exchange rates, which yields a theory of the forward premium puzzle.
Our explanation combines two ingredients: the possibility of rare economic disasters, and an asset
view of the exchange rate. Our model is frictionless, has complete markets, and works for an arbitrary
number of countries. In the model, rare worldwide disasters can occur and affect each country's productivity.
Each country's exposure to disaster risk varies over time according to a mean-reverting process. Risky
countries command high risk premia: they feature a depreciated exchange rate and a high interest rate.
As their risk premium mean reverts, their exchange rate appreciates. Therefore, currencies of high
interest rate countries appreciate on average. To make the notion of disaster risk more implementable,
we show how options prices might in principle uncover latent disaster risk, and help forecast exchange
rate movements. We then extend the framework to incorporate two factors: a disaster risk factor, and
a business cycle factor. We calibrate the model and obtain quantitatively realistic values for the volatility
of the exchange rate, the forward premium puzzle regression coefficients, and near-random walk exchange
rate dynamics. Finally, we solve a model of stock markets across countries, which yields a series of
predictions about the joint behavior of exchange rates, bonds, options and stocks across countries.
The evidence from the options market appears to be supportive of the model.

Introduction

We propose a new model of exchange rates, which yields a theory of exchange rate “excess volatility”
and of the forward premium puzzle. We build on the idea proposed by Rietz (1988), Barro (2006)
and Weitzman (2007) that the possibility of rare but extreme events is a major determinant of
risk premia in asset markets, and develop a tractable framework to study its consequences for
international asset prices.
Our model allows us to propose a solution for a major puzzle in international macroeconomics,
the failure of uncovered interest rate parity (UIP). According to the UIP equation, the expected
depreciation of a currency should be equal to the interest rate diﬀerential between that country
and the reference region. A regression of exchange rate changes on interest rate diﬀerentials should
yield a coeﬃcient of 1. However, empirical studies starting with Hansen and Hodrick (1980) and
Fama (1984), and recently surveyed by Froot and Thaler (1990), Lewis (1995) and Engel (1996),
consistently produce a regression coeﬃcient that is less than 1, and often negative. This invalidation
of UIP has been termed the forward premium puzzle: currencies with high interest rates tend to
appreciate. In other words, currencies with high interest rates feature positive predictable excess returns. There are four possible explanations: time-varying risk premia, Peso problems, expectations
errors, and illiquid markets1 .
Our paper provides a theory of international time-varying risk premia in a complete markets,
frictionless and rational framework. In our model, the exchange rate is both a relative price of
non-traded and traded goods, and an asset price: it is the net present value of the export sector’s
productivity. For this, we develop a “stock view” of the exchange rate. We postulate (to the
best of our knowledge, in a novel way), a linear technology by which an initial investment of nontradable goods yields a stream of future export goods, with stochastic productivity. As a result, the
exchange rate is the present value of the country’s future export productivities, discounted using
the international pricing kernel. This “stock view” of the exchange rate could be used in other
contexts, e.g. with habit formation. In our model, risky countries are those whose productivity will
fall by a lot during disasters.
Risky countries command high risk premia: they feature a depreciated exchange rate and a high
interest rate. As their risk premium reverts to the mean, their exchange rate appreciates. Therefore,
the currencies of high interest rate countries appreciate on average. This provides an explanation
for the forward premium puzzle. The model is consistent with a forward premium puzzle, both in
sample with and without disasters. Therefore it does not suﬀer from a Peso problem. The driving
force of our result is that the risk premium covaries positively with interest rate. In other words, our
theory does not rely on mismeasurement of expectations. We calibrate a version of the model and
obtain quantitatively realistic values for the volatility of the exchange rate, the forward premium
1

Maynard and Phillips (2001) argue that the forward premium puzzle is the result of misspecification issues. The
Fama (1984) regression assumes short-memory stationarity of the data, but evidence contradicts this. Misspecification
arises from long memory in the forward premium (the independent variable), and this may induce a bias away from

puzzle regression coeﬃcients, and near-random walk exchange rate dynamics.
The model is very tractable, and expressions for the exchange rate, interest rate, risk premia, and
forward premium puzzle coeﬃcients are obtained in closed forms2 . For this, it uses the modelling
of environments with stochastic intensity of disasters proposed in a closed economy in Gabaix
(2007b) (Rietz (1988) and Barro (2006) have constant intensity of disasters), and the “linearitygenerating” processes developed in Gabaix (2007a). Our framework is also very flexible. We show
that it is remarkably easy to extend the basic model to incorporate several factors corresponding
to productivity, disaster risk and inflation.
Currency option prices potentially contain rich information both on the probability and severity
of disasters and on currency risk premia. The model generates a rich pattern of implicit volatility
curves for a given pair of currencies, with both a time varying “smile” — higher implicit volatilities
for out of the money options — and a time varying “skew” — higher implicit volatilities for out of
the money puts than out of the money calls. Indeed, the presence of extreme events generates a
smile and the possibility for a country to be riskier than the other generates a skew. We show
that in the model, the price of out of the money risk-reversals — and indicator of the premium
of out of the money puts on out of the money calls — can be directly linked to currency risk
premia. According to our theory, when out of the money puts are relatively more expensive, the
corresponding currency should be depreciated and expected to appreciate. Campa, Chang and
Reider (1998) and Carr and Wu (2007) provide evidence that, as predicted by the model, when
out of the money put prices increase relative to out of the money call prices, the corresponding
currency simultaneously depreciates. Farhi, Gabaix, Ranciere and Verdelhan (2008) confirm this
result on a larger sample of currencies for a longer time period; in addition, this paper shows that
high risk-reversal prices predict currency appreciations and tests a number of other joint predictions
of the model for currency option prices and other international and domestic asset prices.
Finally, we provide a calibration of the model. We show that under some simple conditions,
we match the volatility of exchange rates, interest rates, risk premia, and their half-life. Those
conditions involves taking Barro’s (2006) numbers, which imply that rare disasters matter 10 times
as much as they would if agents were risk neutral. As tail events have their importance multiplied
by 10, changes in beliefs about disasters translate into meaningful volatility. This is why the model
yields a sizable volatility, which is hard to obtain with more traditional models (e.g., Obstfeld Rogoﬀ
1995).
The model also oﬀers a number of additional predictions. First, there should be a clear link
between equity and currency risk premia through interest rates. High domestic interest rates imply
high currency risk premia — an expected appreciation of the domestic currency — and low equity
risk premia. Fama and Schwert (1977) and Campbell and Yogo (2006) provide evidence of the link
between equity excess returns and nominal interest rates. Hau and Rey (2004) find that for Japan,
2

Pavlova and Rigobon (2007) also provide an elegant and tractable framework for analyzing the joint behavior
of bonds, stocks and exchange rates, which is successful at accounting for comovements among international assets.
However, the model is based on a tradition consumption CAPM and therefore generates small risk premia and small
departures from UIP.

France, Germany and Switzerland, a negative shock to the foreign stock market — relative to the
US— lead to a foreign currency appreciation.
Second, the model has rich implications for the relation between the relative shape of the yield
curves between two countries and the expected change in the bilateral exchange rate. Boudoukh,
Richardson and Whitelaw (2006) regress the exchange rate movement on the T -period forward rate
from T periods ago, and find that the regression coeﬃcient increases towards 1 with the horizon
T . Indeed, our theory is consistent with this empirical finding in a context where risk-premia are
rapidly mean-reverting, and productivity is slowly mean-reverting.
The pricing kernels we derive are flexible and attractive reduced-form candidates for models
with time varying risk premia associated with large currency movements. This is, we believe, a
prevalent feature of foreign exchange markets: the carry trade is often referred to “picking dimes in
front a of steam roller.” Although we take the extra-step of linking these risk-premia to aggregate
consumption risk, this step is not needed to derive the asset pricing implications of our framework:
our model does not live or die on this particular hypothesis.
Moreover, time varying disasters are inherently diﬃcult to assess. As such, they might be
especially vulnerable to expectations errors. Although our model embodies rational expectations,
it can also be interpreted along behavioral lines as a consistent framework to analyze the impact of
investor sentiment on international asset prices3 .
Relation to the literature. This paper adds to a large body of theoretical work on the UIP
condition. On the empirical side, Frankel and Engel (1984) show that a simple CAPM has diﬃculty
explaining deviations from UIP. Most papers test the UIP condition on nominal variables. Two
recent studies cast the puzzle in terms of real variables. Hollifield and Yaron (2003) decompose
the currency risk premium into conditional inflation risk, real risk, and the interaction between
inflation and real risk. They find evidence that real factors, not nominal ones, drive virtually all
of the predictable variation in currency risk premia. Lustig and Verdelhan (2007a) find that real
aggregate consumption growth risk is priced on currency markets. This provides support for a
model which — like ours — focuses on real risk, abstracting from money and inflation. However,
Burnside, Eichenbaum, Kleschelski and Rebelo (2006) document that forward premium strategies
yield very high Sharpe ratios, but argue that the payoﬀs of such strategies are not correlated with
traditional risk factors. This disagreement spurred a debate on whether or not consumption growth
risk explains excess returns on currency speculation (Burnside 2007, Lustig and Verdelhan 2007b).
Our paper also contributes to the large literature on Peso problems in international finance.
See Lewis (2008) for a recent survey. Of most interest to us is Kaminsky (1993) and Evans and
Lewis (1995). Kaminsky (1993), extending the work of Engel and Hamilton (1990), considers the
possibility for rare events to explain investors expectations about the exchange rate. Rare events
in her model are infrequent switches from contractionary to expansionary monetary policy. She
provides evidence that investors’ expectations are consistent with the model. However, she does

more recently Frankel (2007) for an insightful discussion.

not examine the forward premium puzzle, and only considers one exchange rate (dollar-sterling)
and a short time period. Interestingly, Evans and Lewis (1995) show that a reasonably calibrated
regime switching model induces important biases in Fama regressions in small samples. These biases
disappear, however, in large samples.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to adapt the Rietz-Barro paradigm to exchange
rates. Guo (2007), subsequently, also adopts this paradigm, in the context of a monetary model,
whereas the essence of our model is real.
On the theory side, numerous studies have attempted to explain the UIP puzzle in rational expectations settings. Few models, however, are able to reproduce the negative UIP slope coeﬃcient.4
Here we concentrate on some of the most successful studies. We start by reviewing arguments
that rely on counter-cyclical risk premia. We then discuss the literature that departs from rational
expectations and introduces behavioral biases.
Frachot (1996) shows that a two-country Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985) framework can account
for the UIP puzzle but it does not provide an economic interpretation of the currency risk premium.
Backus, Foresi and Telmer (2001) pursue a similar line of research and show that aﬃne models of
the term structure can only rationalize the forward premium puzzle if either the state variables have
asymmetric eﬀects on state prices in diﬀerent currencies or nominal interest rates take on negative
value with positive probability. Our model is outside of the scope of their criticism: it is entirely
real and does not belong to the aﬃne class.
Alvarez, Atkeson, and Kehoe (2002) rely on a model with endogenously segmented markets
to generate qualitatively the forward premium anomaly. In their model, higher money growth
leads to higher inflation. This induces more agents to enter the asset market because the cost of
non-participation is higher. This, in turn, decreases risk premia. They later extend this type of
mechanism in Alvarez, Atkeson and Kehoe (2006).
Most recently, Verdelhan (2007) generates counter-cyclical risk premia via the varying habit
formation models pioneered by Abel (1990) and Campbell and Cochrane (1999). In his model,
the domestic investor expects to receive a positive foreign currency excess return in bad times
when he is more risk-averse than his foreign counterpart. Times of high risk-aversion correspond to
low interest rates at home. Thus domestic investors expect positive currency excess returns when
domestic interest rates are low and foreign interest rates are high.
Finally, Colacito (2006) and Colacito and Croce (2006) apply Bansal and Yaron (2004)’s model
with Epstein-Zin-Weil preferences to international economics. Bansal and Shaliastovich (2007)
have two-country setting, rely on a perfect cross-country correlation among shocks to the long run
components of consumption growth rates to reproduce the UIP puzzle.
Turning to explanations based on behavioral biases, Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2006) develop
a model where information is costly to acquire and to process. Because of these costs, many
investors optimally choose to assess available information and revise their portfolios infrequently.
This rational inattention mechanism produces a negative UIP coeﬃcient along the lines suggested
4

For the diﬃculty of generating a negative coeﬃcient, see Hollifield and Uppal (1997).

by Froot and Thaler (1990) and Lyons (2001): if investors are slow to respond to news of higher
domestic interest rates, there will be a continued reallocation of portfolios towards domestic bonds
and a appreciation of the currency subsequent to the shock.
Finally, another strand of the literature departs from the assumption of frictionless markets.
Using microstructure frictions, Burnside, Eichenbaum and Rebelo (2007) rely on asymmetric information and behavioral biases to explain the forward premium puzzle.
Outline. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we set up the basic model
and derive its implications for the forward premium puzzle. In Section 3, we extend the model to
incorporate a business cycle factor in addition to the disaster risk factor. In Section 4, we present
a calibration of the model. In Section 5, we derive the implications of our model for the pricing
of currency options and explain how to extract information about currency risk premia from the
volatility smile. The rest further extends the model. In Section 6, we look at the joint properties
of currency risk premia and bond risk premia by examining the information contained in the yield
curve. We also develop a nominal version of the model which allows for nominal risk premia. In
Section 7, we analyze the relationship between currency risk premia and equity premia. Section 8
concludes. Most proofs are in Appendix B.

Model setup

2.1

Macroeconomic environment: The stock view of the exchange rate

We consider a stochastic infinite horizon open economy model. There are N countries indexed by i.
Each country i is endowed with two goods, a traded good, called T , and a non-traded good, called
NTi . The traded good is common to all countries, the non-traded good is country-specific.

(1)

Note that the two goods enter separably in the utility function. Together with the assumption
of complete markets, this will allow us to derive a simple expression for the pricing kernel.
Numéraires. Our choice of numéraires follows the Harberger convention: we choose the traded
good T to be the international numéraire, and the non-traded good NTi to be the numéraire in
country i. We will sometimes call the traded good the “international good” or the “world currency”.
We call eit the exchange rate of country i in terms of the international good, with the convention
that a high eit means a “high value” domestic currency (when eit increases, the domestic currency
appreciates).5 Hence, if a good has a price pit in the currency of country i, it has price p∗t = eit pit
in terms of the world currency. Stars (∗ ) denote values in terms of the international good.
5

This choice of numéraire, although it does not follow the tradition which is to define the numéraire as a basket
of goods in the country, brings tractability to the analysis.

Hence, its price in terms of the traded good is pt

eit = ptNTi ∗

(2)

The exchange eit rate of country i, in terms of the international currency (i.e., in terms of the traded
good), is simply the price of the non-traded good of country i in terms of the traded good.
So, the exchange rate between country i and country j is the ratio of the e’s of the two countries,
eit /ejt .
Markets. Markets are complete: there is perfect risk sharing across countries in the consumption of international goods. Let CtT ∗ be the world consumption of the traded good. The pricing
kernel in terms of the traded good can therefore be expressed as
¡
¢−γ
.
Mt∗ = exp(−δt) CtT ∗

The pricing kernel means that an asset producing a stochastic stream (Dt+s )s≥0 of the traded good,

has a price: Et
s=0 Mt+s Dt+s /Mt .
Technology. There is a linear technology to convert the non-traded good of country i into the
traded good. By investing one unit of the non-traded good at time t, one obtains exp(−λs)ωi,t+s
units of the international good, at all periods s ≥ t. The interpretation is that ω it is the productivity
of the export technology, and the initial investment depreciates at a rate λ.
Hence, the non-traded good is a capital good that produces dividends Dt+s = exp(−λs)ωi,t+s .
So, in terms of the traded good, the price of the non-traded good NTi of country i is:

Given that eit = ptNTi ∗ (Eq. 2), the following obtains.

exchange rate eit of country i is the discounted present value of its future export productivity:

In Eq. 3, ωi,t+s is the productivity of country i’s export sector at time t + s. Mt+s
is the
international pricing kernel, and is independent of country i.
To our knowledge, the above formulation is novel, complete-market microfoundation for the
“asset view” of the exchange rate (Engel and West 2005 survey earlier “asset view” models, that
feature incomplete markets). The exchange rate is the relative price of two goods, the traded and

7

the non-traded good.6 At the same time, Eq. 3 gives us a stock view of the exchange rate: the
exchange is a present value of future levels of productivity in the country. The above formulation
could be used for many other models of the exchange rate. For instance, the stochastic discount
∗
could come from a model with habit formation (Abel 1990, Bekaert 1996, Campbell
factor Mt+s
Cochrane 1999), long run risk (Bansal and Yaron 2004), or first order risk aversion (Bekaert, Hodrick
and Marshall 1997). We choose to study disasters, in part because they have been less studied.
Potential variants. To keep the model simple, we made a series of modelling choices that
could be modified.
Let us first discuss our specification of technology. We have made the arguably strong assumption
that the investment technology transforms non traded goods in a flow of traded goods. This assumption, however, is not crucial. We could have assumed, for example, that investment goods are a
composite of traded and non traded goods. Let f (et ) be the relative price of investment goods — corresponding to the technology for producing investment goods — in terms of traded goods. We would
£P∞
¤
∗
M

/Mt∗ .
then have the following formula for the exchange rate: f (eit ) = Et
i,t+s
t+s
s=0
Similarly, we could have let the output of the investment technology be a basket of traded and nontraded goods. The stochastic process for the exchange rate would then have had to be solved as the
fixed point of a functional equation. The economics of the model would not be changed materially,
but the analysis would become much more complex and closed form solutions would be lost.
Likewise, we could have used a diﬀerent price index than the “Harberger” index puts a weight
of 1 on non-tradables. This more sophisticated index would put a small positive weight on nontradables. This would not importantly change our results, but would make the analysis more
complex.
Last but not least, the utility function (1) could be changed to:
E0

"

∞
X
t=0

¡ T ¢1−γ #
C
+ V ({CtNTi }t≥0 ),
exp (−δt) t
1−γ

(4)

where V is any utility function over non-traded goods consumption processes {CtNTi }t≥0 . With this
formulation, our formulas for the exchange rate (e.g., Eq. 10-11) would still hold. The only thing
that matters here is the marginal utility from one unit of tradable. Were we to follow this route, our
model would generate a very imperfect correlation between total consumption and real exchange
rates, which Backus and Smith (1993) have demonstrated holds in the data. For instance, V could
incorporate habit formation or adjustment costs.
6

In our model, the real exchange rate is the relative price of non-tradables in terms of tradables. The merit of this
identity has been investigated in the literature. The debate has focused on whether the relative price of non-tradables
is as volatile as the real exchange rate. An important obstacle that any study in this area has to overcome is the
identification in the data of pure tradable goods and pure non-tradable goods. Engel (1999) used diﬀerent measures
of tradable goods to conclude that variations in their relative price accounted for a small fraction of real exchange
rate movements. Burstein, Eichenbaum and Rebelo (2005, 2006) emphasize that that retail prices of tradable goods
contain a substantial fraction of non-tradable inputs. Using prices of traded goods at the dock, they find that the
price of nontradable goods relative to tradable goods accounts for a substantial fraction of the movements in the real
exchange rate.

Macroeconomic environment: Disaster risk

World consumption of the traded good. We will study equilibria where the world consumption
of the traded good C T ∗ follows the following stochastic process. As Rietz (1988) and Barro (2006),
we assume that in each period t + 1, a disaster may happen, with a probability pt . If a disaster

/CtT ∗ = exp(g), where g is the normal-times growth rate of the economy.
does not happen, Ct+1
T∗
/CtT ∗ = exp(g)Bt+1 , with Bt+1 > 0.7 For instance, if Bt+1 = 0.7,
If a disaster happens, then Ct+1
consumption falls by 30%. To sum up:

is the risk-free rate in an economy that would have a zero probability of disasters. For future
reference, we refer to it as the Ramsey interest rate.
Process (5) can be rationalized as the general equilibrium outcome in a model with a finite
number of countries, provided the endowments of those countries satisfy some conditions spelled
out in Lemma 1 of Appendix B.
Productivity. We assume that productivity of country i follows:
ω i,t+1
=
ωi,t

(

exp(gωi )
exp(gωi )Fi,t+1

if there is no disaster at t + 1
if there is a disaster at t + 1

i.e. during disaster, the relative productivity of the traded good is multiplied by Fi,t+1 . For instance,
if productivity falls by 20%, then Fi,t+1 = 0.8. We define the “resilience” of country i as:
¤
¢
¡ £ −γ
bit .
Hit = pit Et Bt+1
Fit+1 | Disaster at t + 1 − 1 = Hi∗ + H

(7)

bit are respectively the constant and variable part of the resilience. This is a
where Hi∗ and H
measure of how well productivity is insulated from world disaster.8 In (7), the probability pt and
world intensity of disasters Bt+1 are common to all countries, but the recovery rate Fi,t+1 is countryspecific. Of course, the recovery rates could be correlated across countries. In order to facilitate
taking the continuous time limit, it is useful to define hi∗ = ln (1 + Hi∗ ).
7

Typically, extra i.i.d. noise is added, but given that it never materially aﬀects the asset prices, it is omitted here.
This model addresses the concern of Brandt, Cochrane and Santa-Clara (2006), who note that discount factors
must be highly correlated across countries. They are in this model, because the crisis aﬀect all countries.

Formula (11) is a modified version of Gordon’s formula. It can be verified that eit is decreasing
in rei : the exchange rate is decreasing in the Ramsey interest rate R, decreasing in the depreciation
rate of capital λ, increasing in the growth of productivity gω . Formula (11) implicitly exhibits a
Balassa-Samuelson eﬀect: more productive countries — countries with a higher ωt — have a higher
real exchange rate. Countries with a high expected productivity growth also have high exchange

Here, changes in resiliences are changes in the technological exposure of the country. One might endogenize them
more, as optimal use of growth options by the countries, along the lines of Berk, Green and Naik (1999)’s model of
use of growth options by firms.

The forward premium puzzle

Consider a one period domestic bond in country i, that yields 1 unit of the currency of country i
at time t + 1. It will be worth ei,t+1 of the international currency. Hence the domestic price of that
bond is given by:10

Hence, countries with high interest rates will see their exchange rate appreciate — that’s the
“forward exchange rate premium puzzle” or “uncovered interest rate parity puzzle” highlighted by
Hansen and Hodrick (1980) and Fama (1984), and replicated for various countries and time periods
many times since (Engel 1996, Lewis 1995 provide surveys).
We analyze the predictions of our model for Fama regressions in two diﬀerent types of samples:

With the calibrated numbers φ = 20%/year and re = 10%/year, the coeﬃcient in a yearly
regression should be β = −2. This is in the order of magnitude of the estimates in the literature.
We conclude that even quantitatively, the UIP puzzle seems to be accounted for by the framework.
The Fama coeﬃcient in a sample without disasters does not depend on B. Even when disasters
are not associated with risk premia — B = 1— the Fama regression in a small sample with no
disaster would indicate a violation of UIP. Time varying risk premia are crucial to explain the
12

forward premium puzzle in a sample with disasters. In particular, for B = 1, there is no disaster
risk (consumption doesn’t fall during disasters), so that β F ull = 1. Hence, the Fama regression
yields a negative coeﬃcient only if disaster risk is high enough. We note that the negative β F ull
does not come from a Peso problem explanation in the sense that, in the model, even in a sample
that includes disasters, there can be a negative coeﬃcient in the Fama regression.
Other Interpretations The model can be interpreted alternatively in two diﬀerent ways.
First, while we have derived our diﬀerent pricing kernels from a CCAPM framework adapted for
disasters, there are other possibilities. The pricing kernels we derive are flexible and attractive
reduced-form candidates for models with time varying risk premia associated with large currency
movements. This is, we believe, a prevalent feature of foreign exchange markets: the carry trade
is often referred to “picking dimes in front a of steam roller.” Although we take the extra-step of
linking these risk-premia to aggregate consumption risk, this step is not needed to derive the asset
pricing implications of our framework: our model does not live or die on this particular hypothesis.
In fact, this particular dimension of the model is hard to test since the problem of estimating time
varying correlations with consumption is compounded in our case by the fact that rare disasters
that might not occur in short samples are crucial to computing the relevant correlations. Using
option prices in Farhi, Gabaix, Ranciere and Verdelhan (2008), we test a higher level implication of
the model — that there are time-varying risk premia associated with large movements in exchange
rate.
Second, while the model is presented as rational, it can also be viewed as a tractable way to
capture time-varying perception of risk, or investor sentiment. Disasters are rare by nature and
their probability of occurrence as well as their severity make them prone to expectations errors,
herds and other behavioral biases. In the model, the varying beliefs about the probability and
intensity of crashes could be rational, or behavioral. Under this interpretation, this paper oﬀers a
way to model time-varying “perception of risk”, “risk appetite” or “sentiment” — people’s estimate
of how their asset would perform in a crisis. Under that interpretation, one doesn’t need to use the
“macroeconomic consumption drop” interpretation. In fact, one can interpret more loosely disasters
as small probability bad events as “financial crashes.” Our international pricing kernel (6) does not
refer to consumption. The agents basically follow an expected value maximization, except that B −γ
term increases the eﬀective weight put on low probability events, consistent with Prospect theory.
The model then oﬀers a coherent way to think about the joint behavior of sentiment and prices.

A setup with a risk factor and a business cycle factor

The above setup gave the essence of the disaster mechanism, but it has only one factor, so that,
controlling for current productivity, exchange rate and risk premia are perfectly correlated, which
in a variety of contexts is not a desirable feature. Accordingly, we extend the framework to a
two-factor model, a risk factor, and a business cycle factor.
13

3.1

Setup with a risk factor and a business cycle factor

In the baseline model, the real rate varies only because of the risk premium. We can easily extend
the model to business cycle movements in the interest rates. For ease of notations, we typically drop
the index i for country i. We say that the country’s productivity is ω t = ω t (1 + yt ), where ω t is
the “permanent” component of productivity, and yt is a “business cycle” fluctuation or “deviation
of productivity from trend”. We model:
ωt+1

In Eq. 22, β 0 is the weighted average of two Fama coeﬃcients. One, β, comes from the variations

value predicted by the expectation hypothesis. The weight ν is the relative share of the two factors
in the variance of the interest rate.

Calibration
Choice of Parameter Values

We use yearly units.
Disaster and risk aversion. To keep the calibration parsimonious, the probability and intensity
of disasters are constant. The probability of disaster is p = 1.7%, as estimated by Barro (2006).
The key parameter in the calibration is pE [B −γ ], the risk-adjusted probability of disasters: disasters
are overweighted compared to their physical probability by a factor E [B −γ ]. This factor is very
sensitive to the severity of disasters and to the coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion. Increasing γ from
2 to 4 for example increases the risk-adjusted probability of disasters by a factor of 2.8. Going from
γ = 4 to γ = 6 increases it by another factor of 5.
We present three main scenarios which diﬀer by the implied risk-adjustment factor E [B −γ ].
These scenarios can be thought alternatively as varying the coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion or

15

the actual severity of disasters:12 these two parameter enter our results only through the summary
statistics E [B −γ ] . Under our preferred calibration (Calibration 1), the implied risk-adjustment
factor is E [B −γ ] = 10.9. This number is in line the numbers reported by Barro (2006) and Barro
and Ursua (2008) for a coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion γ = 4. We also present a Calibration
2 with more benign disasters (higher B or lower γ) where E [B −γ ] = 2.44. Finally, we present a
Calibration 3 with more extreme disasters (lower B or higher γ) where E [B −γ ] = 24.4.
Growth rates. We choose the growth rates so that in normal times, consumption of nontradables
grows at rate gc = 3%. We set gω = gc , but values are not really sensitive to that parameter. We
make sure that the riskless domestic short term rate is on average around 1%, which pins down the
rate of time preference, δ.13
Exchange rate. An initial investment depreciates at a usual rate λ = 8%. To specify the
volatility of the recovery rate Ft , we specify that it has a baseline value F∗ = 0.8, and its range is
Ft ∈ [Fmin , Fmax ] = [0.2, 1.2]. That means that the technology of transforming domestic goods into
international goods could improve. This is because ωt is really the ratio between two productivities
— to produce domestic or international goods, so that relative ratio could increase or decrease. This
possibility of a worst-case fall of productivity to 0.2 of its initial level may seem high. Perhaps it
proxies for disruptions not directly linked to productivity, e.g. the introduction of taxes, regulation,
or a loss of property rights (as in Barro 2006), though we do not model those interpretations here.
The speed of mean-reversion is φH = 0.2, which gives a high-life of ln 2/φH = 3.5 years, and is
in line with typical estimates from the exchange rate predictability
iliterature (Rogoﬀ 1996).

volatile riskiness will have a high v.
To calibrate the exchange rate fluctuations, we start from (11), and take the benchmark of a
constant productivity ω t during the “normal times” period under study. Then, the only changes
in the real exchange rates are due to expectation about the “resilience” of a country if a disaster
happens. Diﬀerentiation of (11) gives a bilateral exchange rate volatility between two uncorrelated
12

Here we take the Barro and Ursua numbers at face value: each observation is a realization of B. Another possibility would have been to estimate a distribution of B for world consumption. This should decrease the importance
of disasters, via diversification. However, many disasters are correlated (as they often occur during wars or global
economic or financial crises). There are several diﬃculties in implementing this approach, from pure data issues to
conceptual issues — for instance, distinguishing between tradable and non-tradable consumption. The data is not
available yet, but Barro and Ursua are in the process of computing these numbers.
13
Note that for Calibration 2, this forces us to adopt a negative value for δ . Alternatively, for the purpose of this
particular calibration, we could have adjusted the consumption growth rate gc ; we could also have introduced Epstein
Zin Weill preferences with a higher intertemporal elasticity of substitution while maintaining a coeﬃcient of relative
risk aversion of 4. We chose to vary as few parameters as possible.

while if they have a correlation of −1, then σ eij ' 2σ H / (re + φ). We report the values for the
uncorrelated case.
Default risk. To keep the model parsimonious, we assume no default risk on debt. This is the
cleanest assumption for developed countries. Of course, in many cases (e.g. to price sovereign debt),
default can be added without changing anything to the exchange rate.

4.2

Implications for levels, volatilities and correlations

Table 1 presents the main results. In Calibration 1, with v = 0.2, the volatility of the bilateral
exchange rate is 11%, and with v = 0.1, 8%. In our low risk calibration (Calibration 2), the
corresponding volatilities of the exchange rate are almost trivial: 1.8% and 2.5%. In our high
risk calibration (Calibration 3) these volatilities are magnified and become 25.7% and 18.7%, respectively. Hence, the model can reasonably generate a high volatility of the exchange rate. The
reason is that disasters have a high importance: their importance is magnified by E [B −γ ], which is
10.9 (Calibration 1), and 24.4 (Calibration 3). By contrast, in Calibration 2, disasters are milder,
risk premia are lower and less volatile, and as a consequence, exchange rates themselves are much
smoother.

Explanation: Each calibration starts with a postulated importance of disasters, E [B −γ ]. For instance
if E [B −γ ] = 10.9, rare disasters matter 10.9 times as much as they would if agents were risk neutral.

and Rogoﬀ 1983).
In the remaining of this section, we focus on our preferred calibration (Calibration 1) and dig
deeper into its implications. We turn to the model’s implications for the correlation between the
changes in the exchange
rate and the changes
in the interest rate. More precisely we are interested in

is close to 0. In the simple version of Calibration 1 we have only one real factor. Hence the correlation
is −1 almost by definition. However, a two-factor version of our model similar to that developed
in Section 3 performs much better. The reason for this is that although the disaster factor pushes
towards a negative correlation, the business cycle factor by contrast, pushes towards a positive
correlation. For the purpose of the calibration, it is more intuitive to model business cycle shocks
as shocks to productivity trend growth rather than shocks to the level of productivity.15
We choose the average standard deviation of the innovation in b

The Fama coeﬃcient is still negative but smaller in absolute value: β 0 = −0.04. This of course, is
to be anticipated because we have introduced a business-cycle factor with significant variance. To

Option prices and exchange rate risk premia

Option prices incorporate direct information about the probability and severity of disasters. In
particular, consider the implied volatility smile of a pair of currencies: a risky currency and a safe
currency. The smile will be much steeper on the risky currency side. A high “smile-skew” should

In order to gain in tractability, we make two simplifying assumptions, as in Gabaix (2007b).

that the distribution of et+1 conditional on date t information and no disaster occurring in period

The option price (26) is the sum of two terms. The first one is a familiar Black-Scholes term. The
second is a purely disaster term. For strikes close to the spot, the Black-Scholes term dominates.
But far out of the money, if the disaster term is not 0, it will typically dominate.

Option prices reveal the risk-neutral distribution — that is, the physical probabilities adjusted for
risk— of future exchange rates. Disasters are associated with large movements in exchange rates.

RR should be positive. If there is higher crash risk for currency A, RR should be negative. If there
is no disaster risk, then RR is very close to 0. Risk-reversals are used routinely by traders engaged

At this stage, we need to specify a detail that did not matter before, the volatility of the realization of FA in (26): for an option, the uncertainty about the realization of the risk matters. We choose
to say that if F A is the expected recovery of country A, its actual realization is FA = F A (1 ± ν),
where the noise ν will be chosen either equal to 0 (no uncertainty) or 0.5 (high uncertainty), no
correlations across countries. Given we have no strong prior on the value of that uncertainty, we
show the plots for two values. In Figures 1-3, the left panel corresponds to no noise (ν = 0), and

and its expected returns are higher. We see that when the noise is higher, the relation becomes
approximately linear as in (30)-(31). Hence, one can hope to use risk-reversals to forecast currency
returns. We explore these issues in Farhi, Gabaix, Ranciere and Verdelhan (2008).

5.4

Some Evidence: Contemporaneous Correlations between Currency
Movements and Risk Reversals

Carr and Wu (2007) compute the risk-reversals for two pairs of countries: UK and Japan versus
the US. They find a high correlation between changes in the price of risk-reversal options and
changes in nominal exchange rates: currencies that become riskier — for which puts become relatively
more expensive than calls — experience a simultaneous depreciation. Farhi, Gabaix, Ranciere and
Verdelhan (2008) extends their analysis to a sample of 25 countries. Their analysis confirms the
finding of Carr and Wu (2007) and shows that it also holds for real exchange rates, providing direct
evidence in favor of our model.17
We next turn to two extensions of our model, to nominal rates, and to stocks.

and

BRW (2006) find that β f wd (T ) increases toward 1 with the horizon. Our theory is consistent
with this empirical finding. Indeed, to interpret Proposition 9, consider the case where risk-premia
are fast mean-reverting, and productivity is slowly mean reverting, φH > φy . Then, large T , ν (T )
tends to 0, which means that, at long horizons, the forward rate is mostly determined by the level
of yt , not of the risk premium. Hence, at long horizon the model behaves like a model without risk
premia, hence generates a coeﬃcient β close to 1.

6.2

A simple model of exchange rates and nominal yield curves

Until recently, forward real interest rates were not available. Only their nominal counterparts were
the support of actively traded securities. Even today, most bonds are nominal bonds.
To model nominal bonds, we build on the real two factor model developed above. Let Qt =

(37)

the nominal interest rate is the real interest rate, plus inflation. The Fisher neutrality applies: there
is no burst of inflation during disasters. With a burst of inflation, even short term bonds would
command a risk premium.
Inflation hovers around i∗ , according to the LG process:
it+1 = i∗ +

1 − i∗
exp (−φi ) (it − i∗ ) + εit+1
1 − it

(38)

where εit+1 has mean 0, and is uncorrelated with innovations in Mt+1 , in particular with disasters.
One could correlate this, but the analysis is a bit more complicated (the analysis is available upon
request). The expected value of 1 unit of currency T period later is:

In this simple model with no inflation risk premia, the higher the variance of inflation , the closer
to 1 is β nom . Hence, countries with very variable inflation (typically, those are also countries with
high average inflation) satisfy approximately the uncovered interest rate parity conditions. When
disaster risks are very variable –and the real exchange rate is very variable — then β nom is more
negative.

6.3

A richer model with nominal risk premia

We now develop a richer model with an inflation-specific risk premium. We extend the framework
developed in the previous section by incorporating inflation risk along the lines of Gabaix (2007a).
26

The variable part of inflation now follows the process:

´´
bit+1 = 1 − i∗ · exp (−φi ) bit + 1{Disaster at t+1} j∗ + b

In case of a disaster, inflation jumps by an amount jt = j∗ + b
jt . This jump in inflation makes
jt is the mean-reverting
long term bonds particularly risky. j∗ is the baseline jump in inflation, b

increase in inflation if there is a disaster. We parametrize the typical jump in inflation j∗ in terms
of a number κ ≤ (1 − ρi ) /2:

pB −γ F j∗
= (1 − i∗ )2 κ (1 − ρi − κ) .

κ represents a risk premium for the risk that inflation increases during disasters. Also, we define
i∗∗ ≡ i∗ + κ and ψ π ≡ φπ − κ. They represent the “risk adjusted” trend and mean-reversion
parameter in the inflation process.
We denote nominal variables with a tilde. The

When a disaster occurs, inflation increases (on average). As very short term bills are essentially
27

immune to inflation risk, while long term bonds lose value when inflation is higher, long term bonds
are riskier, hence they get a higher risk premium. Hence, the yield curve slope up on average — as
implied by the term i∗∗ (1 − exp (−φi T )) ∼ i∗∗ φi T .
Each of the three terms is multiplied by a term of the type exp (−φH T ). For small speeds of

Hence, we obtain a rich, potentially realistic, forward curve.
Nominal yield curves contain a lot of potentially information useful to predict exchange rates.
We now explain how to best extract the relevant information to compute exchange rate risk premia.
As above, the expected depreciation of the nominal exchange rate is, up to second order terms, and
conditionally on no disasters:

It involves three factors that are also reflected in the nominal forward curve. Note however, that it
does not involve the inflation risk premium π it . So, an optimal combination of forward rates should
predict expected currency returns with more accuracy than the simple Fama regression. It can be
shown that when φy 6= φH , the currency risk premium is a linear combination of the traditional
yield curve factors: level rt , slope ∂T fet (0), and curvature ∂T2 fet (0).

Equity premia and exchange-rate risk premia

Our model allows us to think in a tractable way about the joint determination of exchange rate and
equity values.

The maximum Sharpe ratio St is high when resiliency Ht is high. Therefore, countries that
demand low currency risk premia will feature high local Sharpe ratio and high local equity premia.

7.2

Explicit stock values

Another way to proceed is to take a stand on what fraction of present and future endowments is
capitalized in each stock market. A commonly taken route in Lucas-tree economies is to equate
the market to a claim on the entirety of the present and future national endowments of goods.
However, listed stocks only account for a very small and potentially non-representative fraction
of future GDP. Hence, we model stocks without taking a specific stand on the link between the
aggregate dividend of listed stocks and GDP.

trolling for this resilience, if the currency is strong (because the country as a whole is safe), then the
stock price in domestic currency is low.19 As et is expected to depreciate, the expected return of the
stock in local currency is high. In this sense, currency risk premia and local currency equity premia
are negatively correlated. Hence, the theory provides an explanation for Hau and Rey (2006)’s
evidence that the home-currency stock price is decreasing in the exchange rate.

present value of future dividends (the numerator of Eq. 50), because future resiliences are high, and
the discount rate is lower. Hence, the numerator in (50) increases a lot. The denominator increases
also, but not as much. The net eﬀect is that the domestic stock price increases: The cash flows that
the firm produces are more valuable, and less risky. However, take a stock with F∗i = 0, i.e. a stock
that will be bankrupt after a disaster. Then, there is no “discount rate eﬀect” in the numerator of
(50), as cash-flows always have maximal riskiness (they disappear in a disaster). So, the eﬀect due
to the rise in the denominator is stronger. Hence, the stock falls, when the exchange rate increases.
All in all, we see that the price of domestic stocks producing nontradables increases with the
exchange rate, when it is expressed in international currency, but, expressed in domestic currency,
it increases only for the most resilient stocks. Again, one might hope to test that prediction.

Conclusion

This paper proposes a simple, tractable model of exchange rates and interest rates, and oﬀers a
theory of the forward premium puzzle. Its main modelling contributions are, first, to develop an
“exchange rate as a stock” view of the exchange rate, in a complete market setting (Proposition
1). Second, to work out the exchange rate in a stochastic disaster framework, and to obtain closed
forms for the value of the exchange rate, and the forward premium puzzle coeﬃcients.
The paper suggests several questions for future research. First, it would be good to examine
new predictions that the model might generate, including the relationships between bonds, options
and exchange rate premia and predictability. Second, it would be interesting to extend the model
to stocks, so as to study the link between exchange rates and stock markets. Third, given that the
model is very simple to state, and to solve (thanks to the modeling “tricks” allowed by linearitygenerating processes), it can serve as a simple framework for various questions. This gives hope that
a solution to more puzzles in international economics (Obstfeld and Rogoﬀ 2001) may be within
reach.

Appendix A. Results for Linearity-Generating processes
The paper repeatedly uses the Linearity-Generating (LG) processes identified and analyzed in
Gabaix (2007a). This Appendix gathers the main results. LG processes are given by Mt Dt , a
pricing kernel Mt times a dividend Dt , and Xt , a n-dimensional vector of factors (that can be
thought as stationary). For instance, for bonds, the dividend is Dt = 1.
! time By definition, a process Mt Dt (1, Xt ) is a LG process with generator Ω =

Higher moments need not be specified.
For instance, the functional form of the noise does not matter, which makes LG processes
parsimonious. Stocks and bonds have simple closed-form expressions.

To ensure that the process is well-behaved (hence prevent prices from being negative), the
volatility of the process has to go to zero near some boundary. Gabaix (2007a) details these
conditions.

where as before Ft is the reduction in the country productivity in producing the international good.
We postulate that the process for Fti allows the decomposition:
bt + (H∗ + p∗ ) Fbti
pt Bt−γ Ft Fti − pt = (H∗ + p∗ ) F∗i − p∗ + F∗i H

This decomposition is the natural one, as the central value of pt Bt−γ Ft is H∗ + p∗ , and the central
value of Fti is called F∗i . The process for Fit is a LG-twisted autoregressive process:

Appendix C. Variance processes
Suppose an LG process centered at 0, dXt = − (φ + Xt ) Xt dt + σ (Xt ) dWt , where Wt is a standard
Brownian motion. Because of economic considerations, the support of the Xt needs to be some
(Xmin , Xmax ), with −φ < Xmin < 0 < Xmax . The following variance process makes that possible:
σ 2 (X) = 2K (1 − X/Xmin )2 (1 − X/Xmax )2

(71)

with K > 0. K is in units of [Time]−3 . The average variance of X is σ 2X = E [σ 2 (Xt )] =
R Xmax
σ (X)2 p (X) dX, where p (X) is the steady state distribution of Xt . It can be calculated
Xmin
via the Forward Kolmogorov equation, which yields
d ln p (X) /dX = 2X (φ + X) /σ 2 (X) − d ln σ 2 (X) /dX.

42

Numerical simulations shows that the process volatility is fairly well-approximated by: σ X '
K ξ, with ξ = 1.3. Also, the standard deviation of X’s steady state distribution is wellapproximated by (K/φ)1/2 .
Asset prices often require to analyze the standard deviation of expressions like ln (1 + aXt ).
Numerical analysis shows that the Taylor expansion approximation is a good one: Average volatility
of: ln (1 + aXt ) ' aK 1/2 ξ, which numerical simulations prove to be a good approximation too.
For the steady-state distribution to have a “nice” shape (e.g., be unimodal), the following
restrictions appear to be useful: K ≤ 0.2 · φ |Xmin | Xmax .
When the process is not centered at 0, one simply centers the values. For instance, in our calibration, the recovery rate of the country productivity, Ft , has support [Fmin , Fmax ], centered around
F∗ . The probability and intensity of disasters (p and B) are constant. Define Ht = p (B −γ Ft − 1),
bt = Ht −H∗ . We take
