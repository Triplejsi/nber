Estimating Cross-Country Differences in Product Quality
Juan Carlos Hallak and Peter K. Schott
NBER Working Paper No. 13807
February 2008
JEL No. F1,F2,F4
ABSTRACT
We develop a method for decomposing countries' observed export prices into quality versus qualityadjusted-price components using information contained in their trade balances. Holding observed export
prices constant, countries with surpluses are inferred to offer higher quality than countries running
deficits. Our method accounts for variation in trade balances induced by horizontal and vertical differentiation.
We use our method to examine manufacturing product quality among the world's top exporters from
1989 to 2003. We find that the initial quality gap between high- and low-income countries is smaller
than their initial income gap, and that the former narrows considerably faster over time.

Introduction
Theoretical and empirical research increasingly point to the importance of product

quality in international trade and economic development.1 Unfortunately, relatively little
is known about how countries‚Äô product quality varies across time, or how it is influenced by
trade liberalization and other aspects of globalization. A major impediment to research in
this area is lack of data ‚Äî reliable estimates of export quality for a wide range of countries,
industries and years do not exist. In this paper, we introduce a method for obtaining such
estimates that incorporates information about world demand for countries‚Äô products.
Researchers often react to the absence of information about countries‚Äô product quality
by constructing ad hoc proxies, the most common of which is observed export prices (unit
values).2 This measure is unsatisfactory, however, because export prices may vary for
reasons other than quality. Chinese shirts might be cheaper than Italian shirts in the U.S.
market because of lower quality, but they might also sell at a discount because China has
lower production costs or an undervalued exchange rate. If consumers value variety and
goods are horizontally as well as vertically differentiated, high-cost producers can survive
in the U.S. market even in the face of cost disadvantages.
Our method for identifying countries‚Äô export quality involves decomposing observed
export prices into quality versus quality-adjusted-price components. We define quality to
be any tangible or intangible attribute of a good that increases all consumers‚Äô valuation
of it. Countries‚Äô product quality relative to a numeraire country is identified by combining data on their observed export prices with information about global demand for their
products contained in their trade balance vis a vis the world. The intuition behind our
identification is straightforward and has been used extensively in the industrial organization literature: because consumers are assumed to care about price relative to quality in
choosing among products, two countries with the same export prices but different global
trade balances must have products with different levels of quality. Among countries with
identical export prices, the country with the higher trade balance is revealed to possess
1

Flam and Helpman (1987) is representative of a line of theoretical research studying the influence of
product quality on international trade. Empirically, cross-country and time-series variation in product
quality has been linked to firms‚Äô export success (Brooks 2006, Verhoogen 2007), countries‚Äô skill premia
(Verhoogen 2007), quantitative import restrictions (Aw and Roberts 1986, Feenstra 1988) and trade
patterns (Schott 2004, Hallak 2006). The contribution of quality growth to macroeconomic growth is
investigated theoretically by Grossman and Helpman (1991) and empirically by Hummels and Klenow
(2005).
2
See, for example, Schott (2008). More generally, unit value differences figure prominently in surveys
of countries‚Äô ‚Äúquality competitiveness‚Äù (e.g., Aiginger 1998, Verma 2002, Ianchovichina et al. 2003, and
Fabrizio et al. 2007) and also are often used to distinguish horizontal from vertical intra-industry trade
flows (e.g., Abed-el-Rahman 1991 and Aiginger 1997).

higher product quality.3
A major contribution of the paper is to generalize this intuition to a setting where
countries are also allowed to differ in the number of unobserved horizontal varieties they
export in each product category (e.g., red versus blue men‚Äôs long-sleeve cotton shirts), a
standard assumption in trade models. Accounting for unobserved horizontal differentiation is difficult because it introduces an additional factor besides quality that can increase
consumer demand for a country‚Äôs products. All else equal, consumer love of variety implies that countries producing a larger number of varieties in a product category export
larger quantities and therefore exhibit higher trade surpluses. Unless the number of horizontal varieties that countries export is accounted for, this increase in net trade will be
interpreted, erroneously, as higher product quality. Our approach assumes a negative
relationship between quality-adjusted prices and the number of varieties countries export.
We justify this assumption by appealing to theoretical findings in Romalis (2004) and
Bernard et al. (2007) that demonstrate that countries‚Äô comparative advantage sectors
exhibit both relatively low prices ‚Äî due to relatively low factor costs ‚Äî and a relatively
high number of varieties ‚Äî due to disproportionate use of factor inputs.4
Using countries‚Äô net trade with the rest of the world to identify consumer demand
imposes an important practical constraint on empirical implementation of our method.
Currently, the most reliable time-series data on countries‚Äô trade balances are recorded
according to relatively coarse industries relative to the much more disaggregate products
(e.g., men‚Äôs long-sleeve cotton shirts) at which some countries‚Äô export prices can be observed. To deal with this constraint we derive a theoretically appropriate price index
that aggregates countries‚Äô product-level export prices up to the industry level. We refer
to this index as the ‚ÄúImpure Price Index‚Äù. We term it ‚Äúimpure‚Äù because its prices are
‚Äúcontaminated‚Äù by quality. This index has the useful property of being separable into
quality versus quality-adjusted-price components. It is developed under the assumption
that countries‚Äô export quality is constant across products within industries. This assumption creates an ‚Äúaggregation trade-off‚Äù: while product quality is more likely to be constant
across products the more disaggregate the industry, data on countries‚Äô global net trade
3

The use of market shares to infer unobserved consumer valuation is well-established in the industrial
organization and index number literatures (e.g. Berry 1994 and Bils 2004, respectively). Here, countries‚Äô
net trade with the rest of the world (conditional on trade costs) is a natural expression of their ‚Äúmarket
share‚Äù.
4
Feenstra (1994) outlines a method for computing import price indexes that accounts for the introduction of new product varieties (see also Broda and Weinstein 2006). Given its focus on changes in
prices over time, that methodology requires no knowledge of cross-sectional variation in the number of
varieties countries export within product categories so long as that number is constant over time for a
subset of countries. Here, we allow the number of varieties to vary across all countries.

becomes more scarce as well as more susceptible to measurement error. Use of disaggregate industries may also be problematic if countries‚Äô use of intermediate inputs straddles
the industries at which quality is being estimated. Separate estimations of quality for
apparel and textiles, for example, might not capture the fact that some countries import
textiles to produce apparel. As a result, textile and apparel quality might be under- and
over-estimated in these countries.
We show that even though the Impure Price Index comparing two countries‚Äô export
prices is unobservable, it is bounded by observable Paasche and Laspeyres indexes defined
over their common exports to a third country (e.g., the United States). This result
anchors a two-stage strategy for inferring countries‚Äô export quality. In the first stage, we
use the large set of bilateral Paasche and Laspeyres bounds (e.g., Germany versus China,
Swizterland versus Germany, France versus Thailand, etc.) to estimate the Impure Price
Index for each country-industry-year relative to a common numeraire. In the second
stage, we use data on countries‚Äô global net trade in the industry to strip away variation
in quality-adjusted (or ‚Äúpure‚Äù) prices from the estimated Impure Price Indexes. This
procedure yields estimates of quality that vary by country, industry and year.
We use our method to estimate manufacturing quality for the world‚Äôs 43 largest exporters over the period 1989 to 2003. The estimated Quality Indexes reveal substantial
variation in quality levels across countries in any given year as well as across years. We
find that relative export quality for overall manufacturing increases most dramatically for
Ireland, Malaysia and Singapore over the sample period, and falls most dramatically for
Hong Kong, New Zealand and Australia. Among countries that begin the sample period
in the top tercile of quality, Japan and Spain experience the largest (relative) declines. We
also show that our estimates of export quality and their evolution over time can deviate
substantially from estimates of export quality based on raw export prices. Indeed, we find
that our Quality Indexes and raw export prices move in opposite directions for one third
of the countries in our sample, including some of those with the largest increases in our
quality estimates. Finally, dividing our sample in halves according to income per capita
in 1989 (high versus low), we find that the mean quality gap between the two groups is
initially smaller than the gap in mean per capita income, and that the mean quality gap
narrows considerably faster.
This paper‚Äôs focus on cross-sectional variation in product quality differentiates it from a
very large index number literature devoted to constructing quality-adjusted cost-of-living
indexes. Here, rather than measure quality changes in bundles of products purchased over
time, we identify quality variation over simultaneously purchased bundles from different

sources of supply. Since we cannot observe products‚Äô underlying attributes, we are also
unable to make use of standard strategies ‚Äî such as hedonic pricing ‚Äî that link product attributes to specific dimensions of quality.5 Our method complements such efforts,
however, because its use of publicly available trade data permits estimation of product
quality across a broad range of countries, industries and years for which surveys of product
characteristics may be unavailable or prohibitively expensive to collect.6
Our analysis is more closely related to previous attempts in the international trade
literature to deal with potential variation in unit values not entirely due to variation in
product quality. Hallak (2006), for example, assumes a monotonic relationship between
per-capita income and ‚Äúpure prices‚Äù at the sector level while, in the closest precedent
to this paper, Hummels and Klenow (2005) use import prices and quantities to make
inferences about the cross-sectional elasticity of quality with respect to country income and
size. Neither of these papers, however, permits explicit estimation of product quality by
country, sector, and year, as is done in this paper.7 Our approach is also different from an
earlier strand of literature primarily interested in analyzing the effect of import quotas on
the quality composition of trade (e.g. Aw and Roberts 1986, Boorstein and Feenstra 1987,
and Feenstra 1988). In this literature, import quality increases when the composition of
imports shifts toward high-quality product categories. This literature therefore adopts
an across-product-category view of quality variation and quality upgrading in contrast to
the within-product-category view pursued here.
Estimates of countries‚Äô export quality will obviously find use in testing models of international specialization and development. They may also benefit other fields, such as
productivity and growth, where, despite the existence of an influential theoretical literature linking the production of quality to economic growth (e.g., Grossman and Helpman
1991, Aghion and Howitt 1992), empirical investigation of this link is scarce due to the
unavailability of reliable measures of quality. Controlling for product quality is also crucial for computing the import and export price indexes used to deflate national accounts
aggregates. Current estimates of ‚Äúreal GDP‚Äù in the Penn World Tables, for example,
deflate nominal GDP using a purchasing-power-parity index based on final expenditure
data. As noted by Feenstra et al. (2007), this adjustment likely does not appropriately
5

Feenstra (1995), for example, demonstrates how information on product attributes can be used to
establish bounds on the exact hedonic price index.
6
The International Price Program of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics constructs import and export
price indexes by combining survey data on firms‚Äô prices with firms‚Äô assessments about changes in the
quality of their products over time (Alterman et al. 1999).
7
More recently, Khandelwal (2007) has developed a method for estimating quality based on the assumption of a nested logit demand system.

capture changes in countries‚Äô production over time because it ignores the terms of trade.
The ability to net quality out of countries‚Äô import and export price indexes before performing the terms-of-trade correction would enhance the reporting of national accounts.
Development of country-sector specific quality-adjusted price indexes is also likely to be
useful in the labor economics literature. The distributional consequences of international
trade implied by the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, for example, cannot be properly identified if the import and export price changes used to empirically assess the theorem‚Äôs
relevance do not properly account for changes in countries‚Äô product quality.8
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 outlines our assumptions about consumer
demand and introduces the Impure and Pure Price indexes that will be the focus of our
analysis. Section 3 shows that the unobservable Impure Price Index is bounded by
observable Paasche and Laspeyres indexes. Section 4 derives the relationship between
the Pure Price Index and countries‚Äô sectoral net trade. Sections 5 through 7 describe
the application of our method to identifying export quality trends for 43 large trading
countries over the period 1989 to 2003. Section 8 concludes.

Preferences and Price Indexes

This section describes the preference structure underlying our analysis and formally
introduces the price and quality indexes that are the focus of our method.
2.1. Preferences
Goods are classified into product categories, which are in turn classified into sectors.
Sectors are indexed by s = 1, ..., S, while product categories (within sectors) are indexed
by z = 1, ..., Zs . In our empirical investigation below, product categories correspond to
ten-digit Harmonized System (HS) categories, the finest possible level of aggregation in
trade statistics.
There are C countries, indexed by c = 1, ..., C. The theoretical framework presented
below focuses on one sector, s. The analysis for other sectors to which the method is
applied is analogous.
Preferences are common across countries, and are represented by a two-tier utility
function that incorporates consumer love of variety. The upper tier is Cobb-Douglas, with

mechanism.

z

In the sub-utility function (1), ncz is the number of horizontally differentiated varieties of
product z produced by country c, xcz is the quantity consumed per variety, and œÉ s is the
elasticity of substitution between varieties. We note that by indexing product categories
instead of varieties, we implicitly assume symmetry across varieties in the same product category. The utility function includes two shifters, Œæ z and Œªcs . The first shifter, Œæ z ,
varies across product categories but is constant across countries for a particular product
category. It captures consumers‚Äô valuation of the essential characteristics common to the
heterogeneous varieties of a particular product category. Consumers, for example, might
have a higher preference for table varieties than chair varieties. The second shifter, Œªcs ,
varies across countries and sectors, but is constant across products within a particular
country and sector. It represents product quality and captures the combined effect of all
product characteristics, other than price and those already captured by Œæ z , on consumers‚Äô
valuation of a good. Product quality encompasses both physical attributes (e.g., durability) and intangible attributes (e.g., product image due to advertising). These assumptions
are formalized as follows:
Assumption 1: Œæ cz = Œæ z ,

‚àÄc = 1, ..., C,

Assumption 2: Œªcz = Œªcs ,

‚àÄz = 1, ..., Zs .

‚àÄz = 1, ..., Zs .

With the preference structure defined by equation (1), product demand depends on
quality-adjusted or ‚Äúpure‚Äù prices. Letting pcz be the export price of a typical variety of
product z produced in country c, we define the ‚Äúpure‚Äù price of that variety by pcz =
pcz /(Œæ z Œªcs ). The pure price is a quality-adjusted price. It is also divided here by Œæ z for
notational compactness, but none of the results or their interpretation is affected by this
choice.
9

The assumption of homothetic preferences, although standard in the international trade literature,
is potentially strong in this context. It is worthy of more focused attention in future theoretical and
empirical research.

2.2. The Pure and Impure Price Indexes
In this section we develop notation to keep track of countries‚Äô unobserved numbers
of varieties. Define ncs to be the average number of varieties across product categories
produced by country c in sector s,

The normalization in (3) re-scales the number of varieties of each country into common,
country-o units, according to the ratio of the average number of varieties between o and
c. Define also 
ncz to be country c‚Äôs ‚Äúexcess variety‚Äù in product z relative to the world
average,

The Impure Price Index between countries c and d is then defined as
Pscd = Psc /Psd .

(6)

The Impure Price Index is a summary measure of price variation between goods produced by countries c and d in sector s. The index is ‚Äúimpure‚Äù in the sense that it is
defined over prices that are ‚Äúcontaminated‚Äù by quality. The index is transitive, so that
Pscd Psdo = Psco . Choosing country o as the numeraire country, we can associate an index
number, Psco , with each country c, noting that Pscd can always be recovered from the ratio
Psco /Psdo . In particular, the value of this ratio is independent of which country is chosen
as the numeraire.
11

This type of price aggregator is often called a price ‚Äúindex‚Äù in the trade literature (e.g., Anderson
and van Wincoop 2004). We reserve the term ‚Äúindex‚Äù here for price comparisons between countries, in
accordance with terminology employed in the index number literature.

The Quality Index,

Œªcd
s ,

between countries c and d in sector s is simply defined as the

ratio of the two countries‚Äô quality levels. The Impure Price Index and the Quality Index
implicitly define the Pure Price Index, Pscd . The Pure Price Index is a summary measure
of pure price variation between countries, and it is also transitive. Combining estimates
of countries‚Äô sectoral Impure Price Indexes with inferences about their sectoral Pure Price
Indexes derived from their global net trade in the sector, we will use the decomposition
in (7) to identify countries‚Äô sectoral relative product quality.
3.

Bounding the ‚ÄúImpure‚Äù Price Index

The bilateral Impure Price Index in equation (7) cannot be observed because it depends
upon unobservables such as the number of varieties exported by the country pair and the
elasticity of substitution. In this section we outline a set of assumptions which allow the
Impure Price Index to be bounded by observable Paasche and Laspeyres indexes defined
over the two countries‚Äô common exports to a third country. In Section 5, we demonstrate
how overlapping bilateral bounds across country pairs can be used to identify Impure
Price Indexes for all countries (relative to a numeraire country).
3.1. Constrained Expenditure Function
We focus on countries‚Äô exports to a single ‚Äúcommon importer‚Äù, which we refer to as
the United States given the focus of our empirical examination below. The analysis would
be identical were it to be applied to any other common importer.
We define a country as ‚Äúactive‚Äù in product z if it reports positive exports to the United
States in that category. Let Is be the set of all product categories in sector s, and let
Isc be the subset of active categories in country c. Define vector ps to include the U.S.
import prices of all active categories in sector s from all countries. Define analogously
vectors qs , ns , Œªs , and Œæ s . A vector of per-variety consumption xs is implicitly defined by
qs and ns . Finally, stack these vectors across sectors to form vectors p, q, n, Œª, Œæ, and x.
Since our method is based on comparing import prices (as measured by unit values)
across pairs of U.S. trading partners, we need to use notation specific to country pairs.

Index countries in a pair of U.S. trading partners by c and d. Denote by Iscd the set of
active categories common to c and d in sector s. Zscd is the number of such categories.
Denote also by Isc,‚àíd the set of products in which c is active but not d, by Isd,‚àíc the set of
products in which d is active but not c, and by Uscd the union of these two sets. Finally,
‚àÖcd
s is the set of products in which neither of the two countries is active. The set Is can
then be partitioned into Iscd , Uscd , and ‚àÖcd
s .
We can use Iscd to break each of vectors p and q into two components. First, alternatively for each i = c, d, pis(cd) and qis(cd) include prices and quantities, respectively, of
exports by i of products in categories z ‚àà Iscd . The remaining parts of p and q are denoted
‚àíi
cd
by p‚àíi
s(cd) and qs(cd) . These vectors include categories z ‚àà Is exported by all countries
other than i, and also categories z ‚àà
/ Iscd exported by all countries (including i).12
For a pair of exporting countries c and d, we now define the constrained expenditure
(or import) function mcs(cd) (pis(cd) , q‚àíc
s(cd) , n, Œª, Œæ,U). This function represents the minimum
expenditure that the representative consumer in the U.S. would be required to spend on
varieties exported by country c in categories z ‚àà Iscd in order to attain utility level U
when import prices of those varieties are pis(cd) , if this consumer is constrained to consume
quantities q‚àíc
s(cd) of all other products, and the number of varieties, quality, and product
shifters are, respectively, n, Œª, Œæ. The constrained expenditure function solves the problem

By revealed preference, the minimum import expenditure on products produced by
country c in categories z ‚àà Iscd , when import prices of those products are pcs(cd) while
q‚àíc
s(cd) , n, Œª, Œæ, and U take their unconstrained equilibrium values, is the observed amount
of imports:

(9)

However, when prices are pds(cd) instead of pcs(cd) , the minimum import expenditure is equal
to or lower than pds(cd) qcs(cd), because the amount pds(cd) qcs(cd) is sufficient to attain utility
U but qcs(cd) is not necessarily optimal given pds(cd). Hence,

pds(cd) to pcs(cd) , holding constant their number and characteristics (including quality), and
the number, characteristics and quantity consumed of all other goods. The right-hand
side of (11), Hscd , is a Paasche price index defined over the observed prices of the country
pair‚Äôs common exports to the U.S. in sector s.

Paasche and Laspeyres indexes are typically defined in a time series context, where there is a natural
ordering of time periods. Since there is no natural ordering of countries in a multilateral context, calling
one of these indexes Paasche and the other one Laspeyres rather than vice versa is arbitrary.

Equations (15) and (16) relate the implications of consumer cost minimization to

Here, since we allow for horizontal differentiation, we must deal with two cost-of-utility

3.2. Paasche and Laspeyres Bounds on the Impure Price Index
In this section we develop additional notation specific to country pairs. For each pair of
countries c and d, define the pair‚Äôs (o‚Äînormalized) average number of varieties in product
category z:


(18)

Multilateral excess variety measures the extent to which the average number of varieties
in countries c and d is above or below the world average.
Also, for each country i = c, d in the country pair, define i‚Äôs (o-normalized) ‚Äúbilateral
excess variety‚Äù in product z relative to the country-pair average,

that two countries cannot both have positive bilateral excess variety in the same category.

Finally, for set of products A, define the sample covariance over that set of products

as covA (xz , yz ) = (1/ZA ) z‚ààA (xz ‚àí x) (yz ‚àí y), where ZA is the number of elements in
A.
We now lay out a set of sufficient conditions for the Impure Price Index to be bounded
by observable Paasche and Laspeyres price indexes.
Assumption 3 states that country c relative to country d will tend to have positive
bilateral excess variety in those products in which it has a lower relative pure price.

This assumption is based on the results of theoretical models of international trade
with product differentiation that allow for trade costs and do not assume factor price
equalization (e.g., Romalis 2004, Bernard et al. 2007). These models find that, across
goods, the relative number of varieties between two countries is a negative function of the
countries‚Äô relative prices. This finding supports the intuitive notion that countries should
have a relatively higher (lower) number of firms in sectors or product categories in which
they are relatively more (less) competitive, i.e. those sectors with relatively lower (higher)
prices. It is possible to reformulate these models in terms of quality-adjusted variables.
Thus reinterpreted, these models predict that the relative number of varieties in a sector
or product category is a negative function of relative pure (or quality-adjusted) prices.
Assumption 4 imposes the restriction that there is no correlation between the countrypair‚Äôs multilateral excess variety and bilateral differences in pure relative prices.

The magnitude of the terms Œ¥cd
s and Œ¥ s depends on the extent to which countries
c and d are ‚Äúsimilarly active‚Äù. Assumption 5 requires that these terms are zero. A
sufficient condition that implies assumption 5 is that the two countries are active in the
same categories. In that case, the numerator in the expression for Œ¥cd
s is zero, as it sums
cd
over elements of an empty set, Us . Since the sums in the numerator involve positive and
negative terms, it is still possible that the numerator is zero even if Uscd is non-empty.
dc
More generally, Œ¥cd
s and Œ¥ s will tend to be smaller (in absolute magnitude) the smaller is
the number of mismatched active categories (in the numerator) relative to the number of
matched active categories (in the denominator).18
With assumptions 3, 4 and 5 as well as our earlier assumptions about consumer utility,
Proposition 1 demonstrates that a country pair‚Äôs unobservable Impure Price Index is
bounded by the observable Paasche and Laspeyres indexes defined over their common
exports to a third country.

Proposition 1 Under Assumptions 1 through 5, for any two countries c and d, the (unobservable) Impure Price Index is bounded by the (observable) Paasche and Laspeyres
indexes:
ln Hscd ‚â§ ln Pscd ‚â§ ln Lcd

Proof. See Theory Appendix.
This finding provides the basis for our estimation of the Impure Price Index in the
first-stage of our empirical strategy.

The empirical section imposes a threshold number of matched active categories for a country pair to
be included in the estimation.

export flows over c‚Ä≤ = c, we obtain the value of country c‚Äôs exports,

Equation (25) shows that countries‚Äô trade balance in sector s is a function of all the
product-level pure prices in that sector. Our objective is to simplify this expression by
relating net trade of country c in sector s to the Pure Price Index.
To express equation (25) as a function of the Pure Price Index, we must impose
structure on the relationship between pure prices and the number of varieties countries
19

We can associate an infinite price pcz with a product z that is not produced in country c. Since pure
prices are elevated to a negative exponent, this product will have no effect on the volume of trade or the
price aggregator.

A particular case of this assumption is when Œ∑ s = 0, in which case the average number

general case where the number of varieties is allowed to decrease as pure prices increase.
We also characterize the relationship between pure prices and number of varieties across
product categories within sectors as the sum of a common component across countries
(Vs ) and a mean-zero, country-specific idiosyncratic component

Proposition 2 provides a simple expression for the relationship between net trade and
pure prices. This proposition formalizes the key insight of the paper. Price variation not
accompanied with corresponding quality variation implies variation in pure prices. Even
though unobservable, pure prices are manifest in sectoral trade balances. In particular,
the surplus in a country‚Äôs sectoral net trade should be larger the lower are its pure prices.
In addition to pure prices, trade costs also influence net trade. The term œÑ cs summarizes
this influence. This term includes bilateral trade costs between all country pairs. First, it
20

For estimation, we will assume that ¬µcs and the instrumental variable are uncorrelated.

includes all outbound bilateral trade costs for country c. Those costs, œÑ cc
s , enter directly
c
into the summary term œÑ s , which is smaller the higher are those costs. Second, œÑ cs also
‚Ä≤

includes all inbound bilateral trade costs for country c, œÑ cs c . In this case, the inbound
costs enter through the consumption price index for country c, Gcs . The term œÑ cs is larger
the larger are those costs, and hence affect positively net trade of country c. Finally, all
other bilateral trade costs enter indirectly through countries‚Äô consumption price indexes,
‚Ä≤

Gsc , dampening the negative effect of the outbound bilateral trade costs. Therefore, net
trade of country c is higher the higher are trade costs between third countries.21
The impact of trade costs on net trade characterized in Proposition 2 is conditional on
pure prices. That is, while trade costs properly shift the relationship between net trade
and pure prices, they do not provide a comparative statics assessment of the effect of
trade costs on net trade. Changes in those costs will typically affect pure prices in general
equilibrium, implying an indirect effect on net trade not captured in equation (27). Note
that our method does not require that we identify the economic forces that determine
pure prices in equilibrium. It only requires that we control for them. Variation in pure
prices can be driven by traditional sources of comparative advantage, or it can be the
result of macroeconomic conditions, such as over- or under-valued currencies.
Equation (27) can be interpreted as a relative demand function, where net trade is
the ‚Äúquantity‚Äù variable, the Pure Price Index is the ‚Äúprice‚Äù variable, and the trade costs
are demand shifters. The first term captures movements along the demand curve: higher
pure prices of country c in sector s are associated with a worsening of this country‚Äôs net
trade position in that sector. The second term captures movements of the demand curve.
Conditional on pure prices, higher inbound trade costs relative to outbound trade costs
shift this curve to the right.
Before concluding this section, we note that a substantial advantage of using net trade
as the quantity indicator in our method is that it can mitigate our inability to control
for components of trade costs we cannot observe, such as information costs and nontariff barriers associated with commercial policy. As noted above, bilateral trade costs
affect countries‚Äô exports and imports in opposite directions. As a result, the impact
of unobserved trade costs may, to a considerable extent, cancel out. In contrast, an
alternative approach based purely on ‚Äúdemand‚Äù information, e.g., using countries‚Äô U.S.
import market shares rather than their global net trade, as in Khandelwal (2007), is likely
to be substantially more sensitive to mismeasurement of trade costs.
21

See Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) for a detailed discussion of the effects of trade costs on trade
flows in a related setting.

Estimation
In this section we demonstrate how our theoretical results can be used to estimate U.S.

trading partners‚Äô relative manufacturing export quality from 1989 to 2003. Estimation
is accomplished in two stages. We discuss the strategy of each stage, as well as their
data requirements, separately. Throughout, we focus on the key issues associated with
implementing our method, deferring detailed discussions of data requirements to a separate Data Appendix. Raw datasets and the computer code used to generate the results
reported below are available from the authors upon request.
5.1. Estimation of First-Stage Impure Price Indexes
The first stage of the estimation uses Proposition 1 to estimate each country‚Äôs Impure
Price Index, Psko , ‚àÄk = o, where country o is the numeraire country and hats over variables
denote estimates. We note that the choice of numeraire is made without loss of generality;

in our empirical implementation, we use Switzerland. For generic country pair c and d, the
estimated indexes Psco and Psdo implicitly determine the bilateral index Pscd = Psco /Psdo .
This index should satisfy the Paasche and Laspeyres bounds for that country pair, as
outlined in Proposition 1. Similarly, for C trading partners, the C ‚àí 1 estimated Impure
Price Indexes Psko , ‚àÄk = o, implicitly determine C(C ‚àí 1) bilateral indexes Pscd , ‚àÄc, d, that
should satisfy the bilateral Paasche and Laspeyres bounds for all country pairs.
If export prices and quantities were observed without error, estimation would entail
searching for an interior solution to the set of observed Paasche and Laspeyres bounds
across country pairs. Given that import data may be mis-recorded on customs documents,
however, we allow for measurement error in the bounds by assuming that Paasche and
Laspeyres indexes are observed imprecisely. Denote the ‚Äútrue‚Äù Paasche and Laspeyres
cd
indexes by Hs‚àócd and L‚àócd
s , respectively. We assume that the observed indexes, Hs and
cd
‚àócd
cd
Lcd
s , depart from the true indexes by a multiplicative error: in logs, ln Hs = ln Hs + Ã∫h,s
‚àócd
cd
and ln Lcd
s = ln Ls + Ã∫l,s . We also assume that each error is distributed normally, with
mean zero and standard deviation œà s , and that the errors for each bound are independent
both of each other and of error terms for other bilateral pairs.22
Satisfying the inequality constraints of Proposition 1 for a given pair of countries
22

This is a potentially strong assumption because the price (unit value) of a single product might show
up in many bounds, inducing correlated rather than independent errors. It is worth noting that biases
in the estimated standard errors of the estimated price indexes do not affect our results for quality since
only price index point estimates are used in the second stage. Biases in the latter estimates, however,
may not be innocuous.

where Œ¶ is the cumulative normal.
Intuition for this estimator is provided in Figure 1, which considers the PaascheLaspeyres interval for a single country pair c and d, defined by ln Hscd and ln Lcd
s . In the
figure, two cumulative normal distributions, each with standard deviation œà s , take values
of one half at each end of the interval. Consider a pair of Impure Price Index estimates
relative to the numeraire and the location of their (log) ratio ln Pscd = ln Psco ‚àí ln Psdo along
the horizontal axis in the figure. According to equation (28), the height of the cumulative
normal distribution to the left of ln Pscd indicates the likelihood that the true Paasche
index is lower than the estimated bilateral index, that is, ln Hs‚àócd < ln Pscd . Likewise,
using equation (29), the height of the cumulative normal to the right of ln Pscd indicates the

likelihood that the true Laspeyres index is greater than the estimated bilateral index, that
is, ln L‚àócd
> ln Pscd . Choosing a particular value for ln Pscd inevitably involves increasing
s
the value of one of these functions at the expense of the other. If the objective were to
maximize the likelihood that ln Pscd is within the true bilateral Paasche and Laspeyres
bounds, only taking into account the bounds of this particular country pair, then ln Pscd
would lie in the middle of the interval and be equivalent to the well-known Fisher index.
However, because the choices of ln Psco and ln Psdo , which determine ln Pscd for this country
pair, also influence the fit of all other country pairs in which either country c or d are
present, the estimates that maximize the joint likelihood for all country pairs will not in
general be located in the center of the interval for countries c and d. For that reason, ln Pscd
is drawn off-center in the interval depicted in Figure 1. This estimator has the advantage
that it penalizes estimates that lie inside the interval only in relation to the likelihood
that conformance to the theory is a consequence of measurement error. Similarly, it

21

penalizes estimates outside the interval only in relation to the likelihood that violation of
the bounds restriction is not caused by measurement error. We note that this estimator is
not a conventional maximum likelihood estimator as it does not maximize the likelihood
of observing the data (the bounds) given the parameters (the Impure Price Indexes).
Even though the theoretical properties of our estimator are unknown, further intuition
for it can be derived from consideration of two alternatives. The first, which we refer to
as the ‚ÄúV‚Äù estimator, is defined by a quadratic penalty function centered at the midpoint
(Fscd ) of each country pair‚Äôs interval,

Since the midpoint of the interval is equal to the (log of the) Fisher index defined by
!
the intervals‚Äô Paasche and Laspeyres bounds (Fscd = Hscd Lcd
s ), this penalty function is
similar in spirit to other multilateral indexes proposed in the index number literature (see,
for example, Diewert and Nakamura 1993). Though this approach has the advantage of
rewarding estimates that are closer to the middle of the interval, where conformance with
the bounds is less likely to be driven by measurement error, it has the undesirable feature
of treating equally deviations from the Fisher index that are inside versus outside of the
theoretically mandated bounds.
A second alternative penalty function, which we refer to as the ‚Äúsink‚Äù estimator, only
penalizes estimates outside the interval:

within and outside the interval, but only according to the likelihood that conformance to
the theory is a consequence of measurement error.

The index HKskW compares country k‚Äôs prices to those of the world (W ) over the set of
goods country k has in common with the world (z ‚àà IskW ). The world (W ) is an aggregate
of all countries ‚Äî in our case the 43 countries in the sample ‚Äî except for country k. Therefore, the ‚Äúworld‚Äù price of product z, pW
z , is just total world value divided by total world
quantity, qzW , omitting country k in the calculation.23 Though this index has the advantage that it can be computed rather than estimated, it has the disadvantage of treating
an aggregation of countries as a single entity without theoretical justification. Finally, a
bilateral index for country pair c and d, HKscd , is computed as the ratio HKscW /HKsdW .24
We compare the empirical performance of each of these estimators after outlining the
first-stage data requirements. As discussed further below, we show that our preferred
estimator comes closest to estimating Impure Price Indexes consistent with Proposition
1.
5.1.1. First-Stage Data Requirements

Estimation of countries‚Äô Impure Price Indexes requires data on countries‚Äô export prices
and quantities. Here, we rely on detailed U.S. import statistics published by the U.S.
Census Bureau. These data record the total customs value and quantity of U.S. imports
by year, source country and ten-digit Harmonized System (HS) product classification
from 1989 to 2003. We focus here on U.S. import data given its availability for such a
long time horizon, but note that our method can be generalized to include data from
other countries; such data would generate additional Paasche and Laspeyres bounds that
could be incorporated into the estimation. Our use of U.S. trade data presumes that U.S.
import prices and quantities are representative of countries‚Äô exports to other markets.25
We compute the unit value, or ‚Äúprice‚Äù, of export product z from source country c, pcz ,
by dividing free-on-board import value (vzc ) by import quantity (qzc ), pcz = vzc /qzc , where
free-on-board refers to import values that are exclusive of customs, insurance and freight
charges.26 Examples of the units employed to classify products include dozens of men‚Äôs
23

Since country k is not included to calculate world prices, the set of countries in W varies with k. We
do not subindex W by k to simplify notation.
24
Note that since the HK index is a bilateral index applied to a multilateral purpose, it does not
satisfy transitivity, i.e., it cannot be obtained from applying equation (32) directly to countries c and d.

25

In principle, this assumption could be tested by comparing the results of this section to results based
on other countries‚Äô data.
26
A sustained assumption in our framework is that the export unit values that we observe are not
systematically different from the prices charged to domestic consumers, which we do not observe.

cotton shirts in apparel, square meters of wool carpeting in textiles and pounds of folic
acid in chemicals. We focus on manufacturing exports, where a product is classified as
manufacturing if it belongs to SITC industries 5 through 8. Following standard practice,
we exclude SITC 68, non-ferrous metals, from manufacturing. We note that quantity
information is missing for approximately 20 percent of observations in the raw data; these
observations are dropped.
Unit values are noisy due to both aggregation and measurement errors (GAO 1995).
To mitigate the impact of these errors, we both restrict our analysis to relatively large
exporters and screen the raw data. First, we start with the world‚Äôs top 50 exporters
of manufactured goods by value. Second, we employ two types of screens to eliminate
suspect observations. ‚ÄúPrimary‚Äù screening drops observations where only a single unit is
shipped in a year or where the U.S. CPI-deflated annual import value is below $25,000 in
1989 dollars. ‚ÄúSecondary‚Äù screening makes the primary quantity and value cutoffs more
stringent while imposing three additional criteria:
‚Ä¢ (More Stringent) Relevance Constraint: Country-product-year observations must
have quantity greater than 25 and value (in 1989 dollars) greater than $50,000;
‚Ä¢ Presence Constraint: Country-product observations must appear in more than two
years of the sample;
‚Ä¢ Country-Pair Overlap Constraint: For a country-pair comparison to be included in
the sample in any given year, the two countries must export at least 25 products in
common to the United States; and
‚Ä¢ Unit-Value Dispersion Constraint: Country-product-year observations are excluded
if the country‚Äôs adjusted27 unit value is less than one-fifth or more than five times
the geometric mean of all prices for the product in that year.
After secondary-screening the data, we finally impose the constraint that data required
for both the first and second stage cannot be missing for more than three years of the
27

The adjustment accounts for the likelihood that very high export prices are more likely to be the
result of misrecording if they come from countries with relatively low average export prices, and vice
versa. To adjust product-country-year unit values relative to the numeraire country, we perform two
iterations of the first-stage estimation. In the first iteration, we estimate Impure Price Indexes after
eliminating observations under the unit-value-dispersion constraint without making any adjustment to
country‚Äôs unit values. In the second iteration, we divide a country‚Äôs unit values by the estimated Impure
Price Index from the first iteration prior to implementing the unit-value-dispersion screen. We note that
omitting the second iteration has relatively little impact on our second-stage quality estimates.

sample period. After all screens are implemented, we are left with 43 countries, which
constitute the base sample we use in the remainder of the paper.
The costs and benefits of screening the raw data can be discerned from Table 1. Each
row of the table focuses on a different screen, while each column indicates the affect of
the screen on a different aspect of the 2003 sample, though we note that screening has a
similar effect across years. To promote comparability, all rows in the table are restricted
to the same set of 43 countries available after the most stringent screening (that is, the
screening in the final row of the table).
The first column of Table 1 demonstrates that secondary screening reduces the value
of imports captured in the sample by 11 percent vis a vis the primary-screened sample.
The next two columns of Table 1 show that secondary screening also reduces country
and country-product participation in the sample, lowering the number of country pairs
for which data is available to 829 from 861 and the median number of products country
pairs export in common to the United States from 347 to 228. As illustrated in the final
column of the table, there are very few incorrectly ordered Paasche and Laspeyres bounds
cd
(i.e., Lcd
s < Hs ) in all three screens. We do not use those bounds for estimation.
The primary benefit of screening is substantially tighter Paasche and Laspeyres bounds.
cd
As indicated in the fourth column of the table, the median interval length (ln Lcd
s ‚àíln Hs )
under the preferred secondary screening is 0.74, less than one-third the length under the
primary screen, 2.51. The reduction in interval length results in a substantial improvement
in estimation precision.
Of the additional criteria imposed by secondary screening, the unit-value dispersion
constraint exerts the strongest affect on median interval length. For example, an ‚Äúalternate‚Äù secondary screening (not shown) that omits the requirement that adjusted unit
values be within one-fifth and five times the geometric mean for the product-year results
in a disproportionately large increase in median interval length (to 2.01) versus import
value (to 97.8 percent).
The left-hand panel of Table 2 summarizes several dimensions of the preferred sample,
by year. The first column of the panel illustrates that the sample of countries is held
constant at 43 for the entire sample period. The final column of the panel shows that
the median Paasche-Laspeyres interval across country pairs measured in log points moves
between 0.68 and 0.78 over the sample period. The remaining columns of the panel
demonstrate that the number of country pairs, the total number of product-countrypairs, and the median number of common products across country pairs all rise over time.
These increases are driven by growth in the number of products countries export to the

E C

25

United States over the sample period. This growth introduces a potential composition bias
into our estimates, a well-known problem in the index number literature. We attempt to
mitigate the influence of composition bias via use of the ‚Äúpresence‚Äù and ‚Äúoverlap‚Äù screens
outlined above. Unfortunately, we cannot restrict our analysis to a set of continually
exported country-products due to numerous changes in product classification codes during
the sample period.
5.1.2. First-Stage Results

The right-hand panel of Table 2 summarizes the results of the first-stage estimation by
year. Column one of the panel shows that the log likelihood declines in absolute value over
 s , is relatively
time, while column two reports that the estimated standard deviation, œà
constant at approximately 0.15 over the sample period. The third column of the panel
reports the estimation‚Äôs goodness of fit in terms of the percent of first-stage Impure Price
Index estimates that lie within the Paasche-Laspeyres bounds. As indicated in the table,
this share is above 90 percent in all years and rises from 90.4 percent in 1989 to 93.8
percent in 2003.
Goodness of fit for the alternate ‚ÄúV‚Äù, ‚Äúsink‚Äù and HK Impure Price Index estimates
described above, in contrast, is generally lower, supporting the choice of our preferred
approach. As reported in Table 3, the ‚ÄúV‚Äù performs best among the alternatives to the
preferred estimator, with the ‚Äúsink‚Äù estimator a close second. The performance of the
‚ÄúHK‚Äù estimator, on the other hand, is poor: on average, just 43 percent of the bilateral Impure Price Indexes lie within the theoretically mandated Paasche and Laspeyres
bounds. Similar differences are manifest in the first-stage estimates: though we find a
high cross-country correlation between Impure Price Indexes estimated by our preferred
estimator and those estimated by the ‚ÄúV‚Äù and the ‚Äúsink‚Äù (the average cross-sectional
correlation across years is above 0.99 in both cases), the correlation with the computed
‚ÄúHK‚Äù indexes is much lower (an average across years of 0.43).28 Given the similarity of
the preferred, ‚ÄúV‚Äù and ‚Äúsink‚Äù estimates, it is not surprising that the second-stage quality
estimates to which they give rise are also quite similar.
Estimation of the first stage yields an Impure Price Index for each country relative
to the numeraire country. In Figure 2, we report normalized log Impure Price Indexes
for all countries for the first and last years of the sample. This normalization involves
28

In a few cases, for a given country-year the ‚Äúsink‚Äù estimator yields an indeterminate solution over a
compact interval. This indeterminacy occurs for one country per year on average. Choosing alternative
points within the interval has negligible effects on the cross-country correlations cited in the text.

Estimated Impure Price Indexes generally accord with expectations. In the figure,
countries nearer the origin such as Pakistan (PAK) and China (CHN) exhibit relatively
low export prices in both years vis a vis the mean while countries in the upper right corner
like Ireland (IRL) and Switzerland (CHE) exhibit consistently high relative export prices.
Countries‚Äô orientation with respect to the grey forty-five degree line illustrates changes in
relative prices over time. Countries like Hungary and Morocco (MAR) that lie above the
forty-five degree line exhibit rising relative export prices, while those below the forty-five
degree line like China (CHN) and Singapore (SGP) experience declining relative prices.
In both years, the ordering of countries accords well with their level of development. Note
that a mapping of country codes to country names is provided in Table 5.
5.2. Estimation of Second-Stage Quality Indexes
The second stage of our estimation uses the result in Proposition 2 to recover information about countries‚Äô relative export quality from their first-stage estimated Impure
Price Indexes. Given ln Pscd = ln Pscd ‚àí ln Œªcd
s from equation (7), we can rewrite the result
of Proposition 2 as
co
c
Tstc /Ytc = Œ®st + Œ≥ s ln Pstco + bs œÑ cst ‚àí Œ≥ s ln Œªco
st + Œ≥ s Œ∫st + bs Zs ¬µst

(35)

co
co
where t indexes time periods and Œ∫co
st = ln Pst ‚àí ln Pst is the estimation error from the
first stage. The last three terms in equation (35) are unobservable and create a compound
error term that includes: countries‚Äô product quality relative to the numeraire country
co
(Œªco
st ); the estimation error in the first stage (Œ∫st ); and the idiosyncratic component of the
covariance between excess variety and pure prices (¬µcst ) from equation (26). Assuming that
this compound error term is uncorrelated with the regressors is untenable. In particular,
the quality component Œªco
st may be correlated with the estimated Impure Price Index:
developed countries, which tend to have higher export prices, are also likely to produce
higher quality.

To deal with this endogeneity, we first specify a linear time path for the evolution of
product quality relative to the numeraire country,
co
co

ln Œªco
st = Œ±0s + Œ±1s t + Œµst

(36)

co
where Œ±co
0s and Œ±1s are a country fixed effect and the slope of a country-specific time trend,
respectively, and Œµco
st represents deviations of quality from this trend. As in the estimation

of the first stage, results here do not depend upon the choice of numeraire country, and
we again choose Switzerland for this role. Incorporating the country-specific linear time
trend for quality into equation (35), we obtain our second-stage estimating equation
co
c
co
Tstc /Ytc = Œ®st + Œ≥ s ln Pstco ‚àí Œ∂ co

co
where Œ∂ co
0s = Œ≥ s Œ±0s and Œ∂ 1s = Œ≥ s Œ±1s are country fixed effects and time trends, respectively,
co
co
c
and œÖ co
st = Œ≥ s (Œ∫st ‚àí Œµst ) + bs Zs ¬µst is the error term. Note that the terms for both the
trade balance and the tariff could be expressed relative to the numeraire country, but that
doing so would have an impact only on the year fixed effects.
The inclusion of country fixed effects in (37) eliminates the most obvious source of
endogeneity, i.e. the cross-sectional correlation between the time-invariant components of
countries‚Äô prices and quality levels. The inclusion of country-specific time trends further
reduces the remaining correlation between regressor and error term, as the latter term

now includes only deviations of quality from country-specific trends. However, correlation
co
between Œµco
st and Pst may still persist, as shocks to quality may be accompanied by increases
in (impure) prices.
To address this potential problem, we use the real exchange rate as an instrument
for the estimated Impure Price Index. As usual, the instrument needs to satisfy two
conditions. First, because the estimating equation includes country-specific fixed effects
and time trends, the instrument has to be correlated with ln Pstco , after controlling for the
fixed effects and time trends. In other words, deviations of the real exchange from its own
time trend have to be correlated with similar deviations of Pstco . Macroeconomic conditions typically determine periods of over- and under-valuation of countries‚Äô real exchange
rate around long-run trends. These periods also determine changes in the international
competitiveness of a countries‚Äô exports, captured in our model by Pstco . Since Pstco is a component of Pstco , periods of over- or under-valuation are also associated with movements of
Pstco , providing the necessary correlation. Second, the instrument has to be uncorrelated
with the error term Œµco
st , which requires that shocks to quality around the trend in sector
s are not correlated with the real exchange rate. While we cannot rule out that such a

E C

-C

  D   P

  Q 

28

correlation exists, we judge it to be relatively unimportant. Shocks to quality in sector s
might be accompanied by exactly offsetting changes in prices, leaving pure prices ‚Äî and
hence net trade in that sector ‚Äî unchanged. Even if these shocks affect pure prices, they
might have a negligible effect on the real exchange rate. This is more likely to be true if
the shocks are temporary deviations around a trend, and if they are specific to sector s,
that is, uncorrelated with shocks to quality in other sectors. Finally, we also assume that
c
both Œ∫co
st and ¬µst are uncorrelated with the real exchange rate.
We estimate equation (37) using two-stage least squares (2SLS). Our estimate of country c‚Äôs Quality Index relative to the numeraire is

where t indexes the number of years since 1989 and the remaining right-hand side variables
are estimates from equation (37). Note that we identify only the linear trend in quality.
Deviations of quality from the linear trend are confounded with the other two components
of the error term and are therefore not included in our estimated Quality Indexes.

We note that this estimate of the Pure Price Index inherits any estimation error in
both the Impure Price Index and the Quality Index. In particular deviations of quality
from the trend (Œµco

5.2.1. Second-Stage Data Requirements

Estimation of the second stage faces a number of practical obstacles. Foremost among
them is data collection. Obtaining reliable information about countries‚Äô trade balances, for
example, is challenging because countries vary greatly in how they report this information
to international agencies. Similarly, collection of countries‚Äô product-level trade barriers
did not begin in earnest until 1989 and has grown fitfully since then. Here, we provide
a brief description of how our datasets are constructed. See the separate Data Appendix
for further detail.
Trade balance data are drawn from the United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics
Database (COMTRADE). This dataset records bilateral import and export flows between

E C

  D   P

  Q 

29

countries by manufacturing industry and year. Our overall approach to obtaining countries‚Äô net trade is to subtract each country‚Äôs total reported imports from its total reported
exports by industry and year.29 We measure countries‚Äô annual net trade in overall manufacturing as well as the industries within manufacturing discussed below. As required
by equation (37), we normalize trade balances by nominal GDP drawn from the World
Bank‚Äôs World Development Indicators (WDI) database. Data on Taiwan‚Äôs GDP are from
the Economist Intelligence Unit website.
To assess countries‚Äô trade barriers, we make use of data on two types of bilateral trade
costs: transport costs and tariffs. We measure country pairs‚Äô bilateral transport costs
using the U.S. import data, which record both the customs-insurance-freight (cif) and
free-on-board (fob) value for most import flows. Restricting our analysis to the preferred
screened sample described above, we define transport costs as aczt = (cifztc ‚àí fobczt ) /fobczt
and we estimate ad valorem transport costs per mile across all z in industry s in year t
by regressing the relative value spent on customs, insurance and freight on imports from
country c on the distance the exports have travelled,

Tariff information is derived from the Trade Analysis and Information System (TRAINS)
Database maintained by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD). In principle, these data record countries‚Äô most favored nation (MFN) tariffs as well as any preferential (PRF) tariff rates that might be available for a subset of
trading partners at the eight-digit Harmonized System level. In practice, product-country
coverage in the dataset is very sparse, hampering our ability to control properly for trade
policy in equation (37).
The construction of the trade cost term œÑ cst is more challenging because it requires
values for the unobservable consumption price indexes Gc‚Ä≤s (equation 27). As indicated in
29

Unfortunately, country pairs‚Äô reported trade flows with each other are often mutually inconsistent.
Since our principal interest is the accuracy of countries‚Äô overall net trade with the world, we favor this
approach, which maximizes reporting consistency within countries, to the one taken by Feenstra et al.
(1997, 2000), which generally relies on reporting countries‚Äô import statistics to estimate bilateral trade
flows. Further details of our data refinement procedures are described in the separate Data Appendix.

is the share of country c‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ in world production of sector

of country c‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ in ‚Äúworld‚Äù exports of that sector, i.e., the total exports of all countries in
the preferred estimation sample. While this approximation is imperfect, the theoretical
and observed shares should both largely be driven by country size. As a result, this approximate measure should capture a substantial fraction of the relevant variation in the
unobserved shares. The consumption indexes Gcs also require an estimate of the elasticity
of substitution œÉ s . We compute œÑ cst using œÉs = 6 and note that alternative values of œÉ s
ranging from 3 to 10 have almost no impact on our results. We obtain the main input
‚Ä≤
for the construction of the trade cost term, the bilateral trade costs œÑ cc
s , by adding the
measures of bilateral transport costs and tariffs explained above.
Finally, to compute countries‚Äô real exchange rates, we use the real effective exchange

the EIU dataset is reasonably complete, we fill in any holes in it by using data from the

5.2.2. Second-Stage Results

Table 4 reports second-stage estimates of Œ≥ s and bs from the estimation of equation
(37) by OLS and two-stage least squares (2SLS).30 Robust standard errors adjusted for
clustering at the country level are reported below each coefficient. As indicated in the
table, the OLS estimate of Œ≥ s has the expected negative sign but is statistically insignificant. The 2SLS estimate, on the other hand, is both negative and statistically significant
as well as substantially lower than the OLS estimate, -0.325 versus -0.029. The coefficient on the trade cost term is negative and insignificant for OLS. For 2SLS, it has the
expected positive sign but remains statistically insignificant, an outcome that may reflect
the difficulties associated with accurate measurement of trade costs. The final row of the
table reports an F-statistic for the first stage of 2SLS of 37.8.31
Log Quality Index intercepts and slopes, normalized by annual means as in equation
(34), are displayed in Figure 3 along with their 95 percent confidence bands.32 Estimated

Given our rejection of a unit root using the test developed by Levin et al. (2002), we perform the
estimation in levels rather than in differences. The test is performed on the dependent variable, each of
the regressors, and the residual allowing alternatively for a constant and for both a constant and a time
trend. The null hypothesis that there is a unit root is rejected at the 1% significance level in all cases.
31
By comparison, implementation of the second stage using first-stage estimates based on the ‚ÄúV‚Äù,
‚Äúsink‚Äù and HK indexes discussed above yields first-stage F-statistics of 31.9, 34.8, and 3.9, respectively.

Standard errors are computed using the delta method. Intercept and slope coefficients and standard

intercepts are equivalent to countries‚Äô relative log export quality in 1989. As indicated
in the figure, China‚Äôs quality in 1989 is two-thirds (e0.418) that of the mean country in
that year, while Germany‚Äôs is more than twice as high (e0.723). Estimated slopes report
how much relative export quality rises or falls vis a vis the mean country each year. The
countries with the highest and lowest slopes are Ireland and Hong Kong, at 0.076 and
-0.037, respectively, though the former has a relatively large confidence interval.
Figure 3 sorts countries according to their intercepts, from low to high. Though these
intercepts vary widely, they tend to be high for developed economies like Switzerland and
Sweden and low for developing countries like Malaysia and the Philippines. Quality slopes
also vary substantially across countries but appear to be inversely related to intercepts.
Key outliers to this pattern include Hungary, Singapore and Ireland, though the estimated
slopes of the latter two countries are estimated relatively imprecisely.
Normalized Quality Indexes across the sample period are displayed along with 95 percent confidence bands for a set of nine countries in Figure 4. The relative tightness of
the confidence bands indicates substantial and statistically significant variation in product
quality across both countries and years. China‚Äôs export quality relative to the mean country in the sample, for example, is substantially and significantly below that of Germany,
Japan and even Singapore in all years and is essentially flat over time. Quality indexes
for Hungary and Singapore, on the other hand, rise significantly over time, though the
trend for Singapore is relatively imprecise.
To assess the robustness of our results, we performed a number of sensitivity analyses.
First, we find that our second-stage regression results are not driven by the inclusion of
any particular country, as selectively removing each one country from the sample has little
impact on our point estimates. Second, we obtain similar results using either more or less
stringent secondary screens, though standard errors are generally larger in the latter case.
Finally, our second-stage results are very similar when using either the ‚ÄúV‚Äù or ‚Äúsink‚Äù
estimators discussed above to derive first-stage Impure Price Indexes. Though we do not
report all of these results to conserve space, they are available from the authors upon
request.

Evolution of Overall Manufacturing Quality Over Time

This section examines the evolution of countries‚Äô relative manufacturing quality over
time. We show that several developing countries, notably the Philippines and Malaysia,
errors are reported for each country in the separate Data Appendix.

exhibit large increases in relative quality over the sample period, and that changes in
countries‚Äô raw relative export prices can be a poor approximation of changes in their
relative product quality. We also demonstrate that the ‚Äúquality‚Äù gap between initially
high- and low-income countries narrows more substantially over time than their ‚Äúincome‚Äù
gap. Though these findings are primarily descriptive, they nevertheless highlight the range
of issues that our estimates might help address.
Table 5 displays countries‚Äô overall manufacturing quality rankings at four-year intervals
from 1989 to 2003. Countries are sorted according to their ranking in 1989, and the final
column of the table reports the change in ranking over the sample period. Countries
whose rank changes by more than ten places between 1989 and 2003 are highlighted.
As indicated in the table, quality rankings are generally more stable for countries that
begin the sample period with relatively high normalized Quality Indexes. Among the
upper tercile of countries (from Switzerland to Norway), the average change in rank is
-1.7. In this group, Japan and Spain exhibit the largest declines, from 10 to 17 and from
14 to 21, respectively, while Ireland experiences the largest gain, from 7 to 1.
More substantial re-rankings are observed among countries that begin the sample
period with low quality. Across countries in the bottom tercile (Turkey to Chile), for
example, the average change in rank is 2.6. The largest increases in this cohort are
exhibited by Malaysia and the Philippines, which jump 27 and 18 places, respectively,
between 1989 and 2003. The sharpest declines of this group are registered by Colombia,
China and India at -11, -9 and -9, respectively. Across all countries, Singapore registers
the second highest jump in ranking, from 23 in 1989 to 2 in 2003.
Changes in quality rankings inferred from our method can be quite different from
changes in countries relative export prices, indicating that naively equating price and
quality can yield misleading results. Figure 5 compares the change in countries‚Äô normalized
log Quality Indexes versus their change in normalized log Impure Price Indexes between
1989 and 2003. Though these two changes are positively correlated (0.32), quality and
prices move in opposite directions for one third of the sample. For Malaysia, Singapore,
Thailand and Indonesia, quality rises while raw export prices fall, while the opposite is
observed for Argentina, Greece, Israel, Mexico, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland.
These divergences between quality and impure prices are due to variation in countries‚Äô
global net trade balances. As illustrated in Figure 6, for example, Malaysia‚Äôs rising trade
balance combined with its relatively flat impure prices results in rising estimated quality.
The attainment of higher quality levels in manufacturing is often thought to foster
export development, which in turn induces economic growth. Seminal research by Gross-

E C

  Q 

33

man and Helpman (1991) and Aghion and Howitt (1992), for example, highlights a link
between countries‚Äô ability to ‚Äúclimb the quality ladder‚Äù and their economic development.
In these models, productivity gains allow countries to produce higher quality goods and
thereby achieve higher income. Based on similar reasoning, governments in several countries have implemented export development programs that help firms improve the quality
of their products. Despite its importance, there has been relatively little empirical investigation into the link between product quality and economic development, mostly due to
a lack of information about product quality.
Here, we find a strong positive relationship between countries‚Äô manufacturing quality
and income, with the cross-country correlation of normalized log manufacturing quality
and normalized log income per capita ranging from a high of 0.88 in 1990 to a low of
0.66 in 2003.33 The correlation between growth in manufacturing quality and growth
in per capita income between 1989 and 2003, however, is substantially smaller at 0.30.
This relationship is displayed in Figure 7. Prominent outliers to the positive correlation
include the Philippines and China. The Philippines saw its quality rise relative to the
mean country while its income fell. The opposite is true for China, whose quality fell 11.1
percent relative to the average country even as its per capita income grew 130.2 percent.
Finally, we find that trends in quality and income per capita growth are quite different
for countries that begin the sample period with either high or low levels of income per
capita. Dividing the countries in our sample into two groups according to whether their
1989 income per capita is above or below the median in that year, we find that the 1989
gap in mean quality levels between these two groups is initially lower than the mean
income gap, at 0.83 log points versus 2.32 log points, respectively. Over time, as reported
in Figure 8, we find substantially stronger narrowing of mean quality levels versus mean
income levels. While the quality gap narrows by nearly 40 percent, to 0.51 log points in
2003, the income per capita gap falls only slightly, to 2.25 log points.
7.

Estimating Export Quality Within Manufacturing

As noted previously, our method for identifying product quality contains an aggregation trade-off. While product quality is more likely to be constant across more finely
disaggregated products, data on countries‚Äô global net trade and trade barriers is scarcer
33

Even though Hummels and Klenow (2005) cannot obtain quality levels for each country, they are able
to compute estimates of the cross-sectional elasticity of quality with respect to income using assumptions
about the elasticity of substitution and the number of varieties countries produce. Depending on these
assumptions, their estimate of the cross-sectional quality-income elasticity in 1995 ranges from 0.09 to
0.23.

and potentially more susceptible to measurement error. In this section we compute Quality Indexes across the four one-digit SITC industries that constitute manufacturing. We
also estimate quality across the two two-digit SITC sectors that represent apparel and
textiles, respectively, in order to explore the potential influence of countries‚Äô use of intermediate inputs outside of the sectors at which quality is being estimated.
7.1. One-digit SITC Sectors
Estimation of export quality within manufacturing relies upon the same strategies and
datasets described above. To conserve space, we omit a discussion of screening, but note
that primary and secondary screens exert similar influence. The number of countries that
can be included in the analysis varies by industry because all countries do not participate
equally in each industry. Of the 43 countries used for aggregate manufacturing, we are
left with 27 countries in Chemicals, 41 countries in Manufactured Materials, 37 countries
in Machinery and 41 countries in Miscellaneous Manufacturing.
Table 6 reports estimation results as well as details of the first-stage estimation sample by industry and year. Across industries, the data are thicker in terms of productcountry-pair observations and median products in common for Manufactured Materials
and Miscellaneous Manufactures than for Machinery and Chemicals. Goodness of fit in
terms of the share of estimates falling within bounds is highest in Machinery and lowest
in Manufactured Materials and Miscellaneous Manufactures, and this ordering generally
remains consistent with the ordering of their Paasche-Laspeyres intervals from high to
low.
Figure 9 reports estimates of countries‚Äô normalized first-stage Impure Price Indexes by
manufacturing industry for 2003 versus 1989. As indicated in the figure, prices are most
tightly distributed in Chemicals (except for outlier Ireland) and are most dispersed in
Miscellaneous Manufactures. We find that countries‚Äô Impure Price Indexes are positively
correlated across industries. In 2003, this correlation is highest for Manufactured Materials
versus Miscellaneous Manufactures (0.82) and lowest for Chemicals versus Machinery
(0.54).
Table 7 reports the second-stage OLS (top panel) and 2SLS (bottom panel) estimates
of Œ≥ s and bs by industry. The 2SLS estimates of Œ≥ s have the expected negative sign in all
four industries, but the estimate for Chemicals is statistically insignificant. As with the
results for aggregate manufacturing above, the 2SLS coefficients for the trade cost term
have the expected positive sign but are statistically insignificant. The strength of the
real exchange rate as an instrument for the Impure Price Index varies across industries.

E C

-C

  D   P

  Q 

35

The F-statistic for the first stage of the 2SLS regression is high for both Machinery and
Miscellaneous Manufactures, low for Manufactured Materials, but especially low (0.01)
for Chemicals. A potential explanation for this result is that Chemical products are less
horizontally differentiated than products in Machinery or Miscellaneous Manufactures. If
that were the case, export prices might not be responsive to movements in countries‚Äô real
exchange rate and instead respond mostly to movements in world prices. This hypothesis
receives some support from the relatively low price dispersion exhibited in the Chemical
Impure Price Indexes (Figure 9).
Normalized log Quality Index intercepts and slopes along with their standard errors
are displayed along with their 95 percent confidence bands in Figure 10.34 Outside of
Chemicals, most countries‚Äô normalized slopes and intercepts are significantly different from
zero (i.e., the mean country). As with aggregate manufacturing, the ordering of quality
intercepts generally accords with expectations: developed economies have the highest
intercepts in Machinery, for example, while Italy‚Äôs intercepts are among the highest in
Manufactured Materials and Miscellaneous Manufactures, which include Textiles (SITC
65) and Apparel (SITC 84), respectively. China‚Äôs quality ranking, on the other hand,
is relatively low in both Manufactured Materials and Machinery and relatively high in
Miscellaneous Manufacturing. Given the weak results for the Chemicals sector, we exclude
if from further analysis.
Disaggregated quality estimates reveal substantial variation in export quality across
industries within countries. While quality intercepts for Manufactured Materials and
Miscellaneous Manufactures are positively correlated, the correlation of intercepts for Machinery and Miscellaneous Manufactures is approximately zero. Hong Kong and Taiwan,
for example, have relatively high intercepts for Miscellaneous Manufactures but are in the
middle of the pack for Machinery. Quality Index slopes display similar variation: across
countries the non-Chemical industry slopes have the same sign in only 17 of the 43 countries in the sample. These differences are highlighted in Figure 11 for the subset of nine
countries examined above. For Singapore, quality increases relatively strongly compared
to the mean country in all three sectors. For Malaysia, quality increases strongly in Machinery, much more moderately in Manufactured Materials, and declines in Miscellaneous
Manufactures.
Quality convergence within manufacturing also varies across industries. Figure 12
reports the evolution of mean quality for countries with initially high and low per capita
34

As noted above, standard errors are computed using the delta method. Intercept and slope coefficients
and standard errors are reported for each country and industry in the separate Data Appendix.

36

income. As indicated in the figure, there is a substantial narrowing of quality in Machinery,
weaker convergence in Miscellaneous Manufactures and an unchanging quality gap in
Manufactured Materials.
7.2. Two-digit SITC Sectors: Apparel and Textiles
As noted in the introduction, our method for estimating product quality involves an
aggregation trade-off. For broad SITC categories such as all manufacturing, the assumption of constant quality across all products in the category is strong, but data on countries‚Äô
global net trade is more readily available and more likely to be reliable. Another potential advantage of using broader SITC sectors is their ability to dampen the impact of
countries‚Äô use of imported intermediate inputs. Use of such inputs is an issue when they
straddle the sectors at which quality is being estimated. Countries with a strong comparative advantage in one sector, for example, might be large net exporters of that sector
but large net importers of a second sector which is an input to the first. All else equal,
this situation may lead quality in the first and second sectors to be over- and underestimated, respectively. In principle this problem can be solved by using input-output tables
to map imported intermediates to final goods. Unfortunately, such tables are unavailable
at a useful level of aggregation for a wide sample of countries. Another potential solution
would be to use value added trade data, but these data, too, are generally unavailable.
In this section we investigate the potential impact of input-output linkages across
sectors by examining the relationship between textiles (SITC 65) and apparel (SITC 84).
We also explore a potential solution to the intermediate-inputs problem that involves
combining linked industries into a more aggregate sector. First, we estimate quality
for textiles and apparel separately. We then estimate quality for the hybrid ‚ÄúApparel
& Textiles‚Äù, which includes products from both industries. We find that even though
cross-country correlations of apparel and Apparel & Textile quality are high in every
year, estimated quality for apparel declines substantially for some countries when textile
deficits are taken into account.
Across the sample period, an average trade surplus in apparel coincides with an average trade deficit in textiles in eight developing countries: Colombia, Hong Kong, Israel,
Mexico, Malaysia, the Philippines, Portugal and South Africa. The contrast is most stark
for Hong Kong, whose average net trade in SITC 65 and SITC 84 over the sample period
is -1.0 and 7.6 percent of GDP, respectively.35 The opposite pattern, that is, an average
35

Interestingly, Hong Kong‚Äôs net trade in these two sectors move in opposite directions over time, with
the result that its declining trade surplus in Apparel & Textiles is less extreme than its declining trade

E C

37

deficit in apparel and an average surplus in textiles, is exhibited by several developed
economies: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Japan and Switzerland. The remaining
countries either have a surplus in both sectors (e.g., Italy, Pakistan and Romania), or a
deficit in both sectors (e.g., Spain, Ireland and Sweden). The largest re-ranking of apparel
versus Apparel & Textile qualities occurs for Pakistan, which has a strong surplus in both
apparel and textiles.
Table 8 reports 2SLS estimates of Œ≥ s and bs for SITC 65, SITC 84 and the hybrid
Apparel & Textiles. The estimates of Œ≥ s for all three remain negative and significant, while
the estimates for the trade cost term have the indicated signs but remain insignificant.
Though the Quality Index intercepts and slopes for the hybrid sector versus those for
SITC 84 differ markedly for some countries, their correlations across all countries are
quite high: 0.90 for the intercepts and 0.91 for the slopes. Estimated Quality Indexes are
also highly correlated across years, ranging from 0.90 in 1989 to 0.74 in 2003.
These findings suggest that even though controlling for intermediate inputs does not
appear to change the overall pattern of results across countries, it can have a substantial
effect on individual countries‚Äô estimated quality. As a result, it would be prudent to
include as much information about input-output linkages as possible when estimating
quality at low levels of aggregation. Over time, collection and dissemination of more
detailed data on countries‚Äô international trade and use of inputs should make this task
easier.

Conclusion

This paper attempts to fill an important gap in the international trade and development literature by outlining a method for identifying how countries‚Äô product quality
evolves over time. First, we show how an important but unobserved Impure Price Index
comparing countries‚Äô export prices is bounded by their observable Paasche and Laspeyres
indexes. Then, we develop a method for decomposing an estimate of this Impure Price
Index into Quality and Pure Price Indexes. This method makes use of information on
consumers‚Äô valuation of countries‚Äô products contained in their net trade with the world
and allows for both vertical and horizontal product differentiation. In contrast to a vast
literature that associates cross-country variation in export unit-values with variation in
product quality ‚Äî implicitly assuming away cross-country variation in quality-adjusted
prices ‚Äî our method allows for price variation induced by factors other than quality, e.g.,
surplus in apparel. Between 1989 and 2003, Hong Kong‚Äôs apparel surplus declines from 13.4 to 5.3 percent
of GDP, while its Apparel & Textiles surplus declines from 11.2 to 5.6 percent of GDP.

comparative advantage or currency misalignment.
Implementation of our method reveals trends in product quality not evident in export
prices alone. Indeed, for several countries, export prices and quality evolve quite differently. Our estimation also highlights the importance of accounting for intermediate trade
in estimating countries‚Äô export quality. Further theoretical and empirical efforts on this
front will be quite useful.

Notes: Table displays several attributes of the estimation sample for all manufacturing in 2003 according to three
methods of screening the raw data. All samples contain the same set of 43 countries. Import value for each sample is
expressed as a percentage of the unscreened sample. Explicit country-pair comparisons is the number of country pairs
that appear in the sample; the maximum is 903 (i.e., 43*42/2). Median common products is the median number of
export products exported in common to the United States across country pairs appearing in the sample. Median interval
length is the median log difference between Paasche and Laspeyres bounds. Correctly ordered bounds is the percent of
bounds in the sample for which the Paasche index is less than the Laspeyres index.

Notes: Table reports OLS and 2SLS regression results for equation (37). The instrument for the
Impure Price Index is the real exchange rate. Coefficients for country fixed effects and time
trends are omitted. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors adjusted for clustering at the
country level are reported below each coefficient. The instrument for the Impure Price Index in
the 2SLS results is the real exchange rate. ** and *** denote statistical significance at the 5 and
1 percent level, respectively.
