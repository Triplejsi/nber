Measuring Financial Asset Return and Volatility Spillovers, With Application to Global Equity
Markets

NBER Working Paper No. 13811
February 2008
JEL No. G1
ABSTRACT
We provide a simple and intuitive measure of interdependence of asset returns and/or volatilities. In
particular, we formulate and examine precise and separate measures of return spillovers and volatility
spillovers. Our framework facilitates study of both non-crisis and crisis episodes, including trends
and bursts in spillovers, and both turn out to be empirically important. In particular, in an analysis
of nineteen global equity markets from the early 1990s to the present, we find striking evidence of
divergent behavior in the dynamics of return spillovers vs. volatility spillovers: Return spillovers display
a gently increasing trend but no bursts, whereas volatility spillovers display no trend but clear bursts.

1. Introduction
For many years but especially following the late 1990s Asian crisis, much has been made
of the nature of financial market interdependence, both in terms of returns and return volatilities
(e.g., King, Sentana and Wadhwani, 1994; Forbes and Rigobon, 2002). Against this background,
we propose a simple quantitative measure of such interdependence, which we call a spillover
index, and associated tools that we call spillover tables and spillover plots.
The intensity of spillovers may of course vary over time, and the nature of any timevariation is of potentially great interest. We allow for it in an analysis of a broad set of global
equity returns and volatilities from the early 1990s to the present, and we show that spillovers are
important, spillover intensity is indeed time-varying, and the nature of the time-variation is
strikingly different for returns vs. volatilities.
We proceed by proposing the spillover index in Section 2 and describing our global equity
data in Section 3. We perform a full-sample spillover analysis in Section 4 and a rolling-sample
analysis allowing for time-varying spillovers in Section 5. We briefly assess the robustness of
our results in section 6, and we summarize and conclude in Section 7.
2. The Spillover Index
We base our measurement of return and volatility spillovers on vector autoregressive
(VAR) models in the broad tradition of Engle, Ito and Lin (1990). Our approach, however, is
very different. We focus on variance decompositions, which are already well-understood and
widely-calculated. As we will show, they allow us to aggregate spillover effects across markets,
distilling a wealth of information into a single spillover measure.
The basic spillover index idea is simple and intuitive, yet rigorous and replicable,
following directly from the familiar notion of a variance decomposition associated with an Nvariable VAR. Roughly, for each asset i we simply add the shares of its forecast error variance
coming from shocks to asset j, for all j ≠ i , and then we add across all i = 1,..., N .
To minimize notational clutter, consider first the simple example of a covariance
stationary first-order two-variable VAR,

xt = Φxt −1 + ε t ,

-2-

where xt = ( x1,t , x2,t ) ' and Φ is a 2x2 parameter matrix. In our subsequent empirical work, x will
be either a vector of stock returns or a vector of stock return volatilities. By covariance
stationarity, the moving average representation of the VAR exists and is given by
xt = Θ( L)ε t ,
where Θ( L) = ( I − ΦL) −1 . It will prove useful to rewrite the moving average representation as
xt = A( L)ut ,
where A( L) = Θ( L)Qt−1 , ut = Qt ε t , E (ut ut, ) = I , and Qt−1 is the unique lower-triangular Cholesky

factor of the covariance matrix of ε t .
Now consider 1-step-ahead forecasting. Immediately, the optimal forecast (more
precisely, the Wiener-Kolmogorov linear least-squares forecast) is
xt +1,t = Φxt ,
with corresponding 1-step-ahead error vector
⎡a
et +1,t = xt +1 − xt +1,t = A0ut +1 = ⎢ 0,11
⎣ a0,21

a0,12 ⎤ ⎡ u1,t +1 ⎤
⎥⎢
⎥,
a0,22 ⎦ ⎣u2,t +1 ⎦

which has covariance matrix
E (et +1,t et' +1,t ) = A0 A0' .

, and the
Hence, in particular, the variance of the 1-step-ahead error in forecasting x1t is a0,11
2
2
variance of the 1-step-ahead error in forecasting x2t is a0,21
+ a0,22
.

Variance decompositions allow us to split the forecast error variances of each variable
into parts attributable to the various system shocks. More precisely, for the example at hand, they
answer the questions: What fraction of the 1-step-ahead error variance in forecasting x1 is due to
shocks to x1 ? Shocks to x2 ? And similarly, what fraction of the 1-step-ahead error variance in
forecasting x2 is due to shocks to x1 ? Shocks to x2 ?

-3-

Let us define own variance shares to be the fractions of the 1-step-ahead error variances
in forecasting xi due to shocks to xi , for i=1, 2, and cross variance shares, or spillovers, to be the
fractions of the 1-step-ahead error variances in forecasting xi due to shocks to x j , for i, j=1, 2,
i ≠ j . There are two possible spillovers in our simple two-variable example: x1t shocks that

S=

Having illustrated the Spillover Index in a simple first-order two-variable case, it is a
simple matter to generalize it to richer dynamic environments. In particular, for a pth-order Nvariable VAR (but still using 1-step-ahead forecasts) we immediately have

Such generality is often useful. In much of the empirical work that follows, for example, we use
second-order 19-variable VARs with 10-step-ahead forecasts.

3. Global Equity Market Return and Volatility Data

Our underlying data are daily nominal local-currency stock market indexes, January 1992
– November 2007, taken from Datastream and Global Financial Data. We examine seven
developed stock markets (for the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and Australia)
and twelve emerging markets (Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan,
Thailand, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Turkey).
We calculate returns as the change in log price, Wednesday-to-Wednesday. When price
data for Wednesday are not available due to a holiday, we use Thursday. We then convert
weekly returns from nominal to real terms using monthly consumer price indexes from the IMF’s
International Financial Statistics. To do so we assume that the weekly inflation rate π t is
constant within the month, in which case we can calculate it simply as the 1/4th power of the
monthly inflation rate, and we then calculate the weekly real return as

1 + it
− 1 , where it is the
1+ πt

weekly nominal return. We provide a variety of descriptive statistics for returns in Table 1.
We assume that volatility is fixed within periods (in this case, weeks) but variable across
periods. Then, following Garman and Klass (1980) and Alizadeh, Brandt and Diebold (2002), we
can use weekly high, low, opening and closing prices obtained from underlying daily
high/low/open/close data to estimate weekly stock return volatility:
σ 2 = 0.511 ( H t − Lt ) 2 − 0.019 [ ( C t − O t )( H t + Lt − 2 O t ) − 2( H t − O t )( Lt − O t ) ] − 0.383( C t − O t ) 2 ,

where H is the Monday-Friday high, L is the Monday-Friday low, O is the Monday open and C is the
Friday close (all in natural logarithms). We provide descriptive statistics for volatilities in Table 2.
4. Full-Sample Analysis: Spillover Tables

Here we provide a full-sample analysis of global stock market return and volatility
spillovers. As part of that analysis, we propose decomposing the Spillover Index into all of the
forecast error variance components for variable i coming from shocks to variable j, for all i and j.
We begin by characterizing return and volatility spillovers over the entire sample, January
1992-November 2007. Subsequently we will track time variation in spillovers via rolling
window estimation.) We report Spillover Indexes for returns and volatility in the lower right
corners of Tables 3 and 4, respectively. Before discussing them, however, let us describe the rest

-5-

of the two tables, which we call Spillover Tables. The ij th entry in the table is the estimated
contribution to the forecast error variance of country i (returns in Table 3, volatility in Table 4)
coming from innovations to country j (again, returns in Table 3, volatility in Table 4).1 Hence the
off-diagonal column sums (labeled Contributions to Others) or row sums (labeled Contributions
from Others), when totaled across countries, give the numerator of the Spillover Index. Similarly,
the column sums or row sums (including diagonals), when totaled across countries, give the
denominator of the Spillover Index.
The Spillover Table, then, provides an “input-output” decomposition of the Spillover
Index. For example, we learn from Spillover Table 3 (for returns) that innovations to U.S. returns
are responsible for 22.2 percent of the error variance in forecasting 10-week-ahead Mexican
returns, but only 3.0 percent of the error variance in forecasting 10-week-ahead Turkish returns.
That is, return spillovers from the U.S. to Mexico are larger than for the U.S. to Turkey. As
another example, we see from Table 4 (volatility) that total volatility spillovers from Hong Kong
to others (that is, Hong Kong Contributions to Others) are much larger than total volatility
spillovers from others to Hong Kong (Hong Kong Contributions from Others).
The key substantive summary result to emerge from Tables 3 and 4 is that, distilling all of
the various cross-country spillovers into a single Spillover Index for our full 1992-2007 data
sample, we find that almost forty percent of forecast error variance comes from spillovers, both
for returns (36 percent) and volatilities (40 percent). Hence spillovers are important in both
returns and volatilities, and on average – that is, unconditionally – return and volatility spillovers
are of the same magnitude.
However, at any given point in time – that is, conditionally – return and volatility
spillovers may be very different, and more generally, their dynamics may be very different. We
now substantiate these assertions by moving from a static full-sample analysis to a dynamic
rolling-sample analysis.

The results are based on weekly vector autoregressions of order 2 (selected using the Schwarz criterion), identified
using a Cholesky factorization with the ordering as shown in the column heading, and 10-week-ahead forecasts.

5. Rolling-Sample Analysis: Spillover Plots

Clearly, many changes took place during the years in our sample, 1992-2007. Some are
well-described as more-or-less continuous evolution, such as increased linkages among global
financial markets and increased mobility of capital, due to globalization, the move to electronic
trading, and the rise of hedge funds. Others are better described as bursts that subsequently
subside, such as the various Asian currency crises around 1997.
Given this background of financial market evolution and turbulence, it seems unlikely that
any single fixed-parameter model would apply over the entire sample. Hence the full-sample
Spillover Tables and Spillover Indexes obtained earlier, although providing a useful summary of
“average” behavior, likely miss the potentially important secular and cyclical movements in
spillovers. To address this issue, we now estimate the models using 200-week rolling samples,
and we assess the extent and nature of spillover variation over time via the corresponding time
series of Spillover Indexes, which we examine graphically in Spillover Plots.
We present the Spillover Plot for returns in Figure 1. It is largely uneventful, displaying a
gently increasing trend, but little else. Notice that even as the estimation window moves beyond
the mid-1990s, the return Spillover Plots never decline to their earlier lower range. This is
consistent with a maintained increase in financial market integration. In recent years, however,
the upward trend in the return Spillover Plot has become steeper.
We also present the Spillover Plot for volatility in Figure 1. It is radically different,
ranging widely and responding to economic events. Some of those events are major, including
(1) the East Asian currency crisis in late 1997 (the devaluation of Thai Baht in July 1997, the
spread to Hong Kong in October 1997, and further spread to other major economies in the region
such as South Korea, Malaysia and Indonesia through January 1998), (2) the June-August 1998
Russian crisis (the first wave was controlled by the IMF’s announcement of a support package in
June 1998, and the final outbreak occurred in August 1998), (3) the intense reversal of capital
flows from emerging markets following strong signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve of likely
additional hikes in the Fed Funds rate during May-June 2006, and finally, (4) the financial market
turmoil associated with the subprime mortgage market that started in July-August 2007, as well
as the first signs of the problem in march 2007.

-7-

Additional important events generating volatility spillovers include (1) the Brazilian crisis
of January 1999, (2) the U.S. terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, and (3) the “dollar crisis” of
March 2005, associated with remarks from policy makers in several emerging and industrialized
countries (South Korea, Russia, China, India and Japan) indicating that they were considering
central bank reserve diversification away from the U.S. dollar. In any event, the key insight is
that many well-known events produced large volatility spillovers, whereas, with the possible
exception of the recent subprime episode (which generates the highest value of the volatility
Spillover Index since the East Asian crisis of 1997-1998), none produced return spillovers.2
6. Robustness

We now perform some simple variations on our basic analysis, with an eye toward
checking robustness with respect to the rolling window width, the forecast horizon, and the
ordering of the VAR.
In Figure 2 we show Spillover Plots produced using a shorter 75-week rolling window
width, and two variance decomposition forecast horizons. (We use the original 10-week forecast
horizon in panel 2a and a shorter 2-week horizon in panel 2b.) Our earlier results appear largely
robust to all variations. The reduced smoothing due to the shorter window width, moreover, lets
us track movements in volatility spillovers with greater resolution.
In Figure 3 we show Spillover Plots produced using a still-shorter 75-week rolling
window width, and very short 10-day and 2-day variance decomposition forecast horizons. Our
results again appear robust to window width and forecast horizon. Indeed they are also robust to
choice of volatility estimator: We conduct the analyses underlying Figure 3 using daily, as
opposed to weekly, range-based volatilities.3
In Figure 4 we explore robustness to VAR ordering, plotting maximum and minimum
volatility spillovers across a variety of alternative VAR orderings, estimated using 200-week
rolling windows. Computational considerations generally prohibit exploration of robustness of
volatility Spillover Plots to all N! possible variable orderings of an N-variable VAR. (In our
case, for example, N=19, resulting in roughly 1017 possible orderings.) Hence in panel 4a we
present results for eighteen “rotated” orderings corresponding to moving the U.S. to last, and then
2

We provide weekly updated spillover plots, for both returns and volatilities, at
http://data.economicresearchforum.org/erf/SpillOverIndex.aspx?lang=en
3
Because of different holidays, one or more markets may be closed on any day. To circumvent this problem, we set
missing days’ volatilities equal to previous-day observations. We also assume that all stock markets are closed on
Christmas day, New Year’s Eve, and Easter, because an overwhelming majority of markets are closed then.

-8-

moving the U.K. to last, and so on, and in panel 4b we present results for fifty randomly-chosen
orderings. Throughout, the spillover range is small, and the same patterns are clearly revealed.
7. Summary and Concluding Remarks

We have proposed a simple framework for measuring linkages in asset returns and return
volatilities. In particular, we have formulated and examined precise measures of return
spillovers and volatility spillovers based directly on the familiar notion of variance
decompositions in vector autoregressions. Our spillover measures have the appealing virtue of
conveying important and useful information while nevertheless sidestepping the contentious
issue of definition and existence of episodes of “contagion” so vigorously debated in recent
literature such as Forbes and Rigobon (2002).
Our framework facilitates study of both crisis and non-crisis episodes, including trends as
well as bursts in spillovers. In an analysis of nineteen global equity markets from the early 1990s
to the present, we find striking evidence of divergent behavior in the dynamics of return
spillovers vs. volatility spillovers. To a good approximation, return spillovers display no bursts
but a gently increasing trend, presumably associated with the gradually increasing financial
market integration of the last fifteen years. Volatility spillovers, in contrast, display no trend but
clear bursts associated with readily-identified “crisis” events. Why this should be so is a
tremendously interesting question, albeit one about which existing theory evidently has little to
say. We hope that our measurement will stimulate new theory that speaks to the distinction
between return and volatility spillovers.
As for future work, there are several interesting directions for extension. On the
theoretical side, it would be interesting to attempt to bound the range of spillovers corresponding
to all N! variance decompositions associated with the set of all possible VAR orderings (e.g.,
building on Faust, 1998), or to produce spillover plots based on variance decompositions
invariant to ordering (e.g., building on Pesaran and Shin, 1998). On the substantive empirical
side, it will be interesting to analyze volatility spillovers not only in stock markets, but also
within and across other financial markets, as well as in cross-country real activity and inflation.

Notes to Tables
Table 1: Returns are in real terms and measured weekly, Friday-to-Friday. The sample size is
829. See text for details.
Table 2: Volatilities are for Monday-to-Friday returns. The mnemonics are as in Table 1. We
calculate Chile’s volatility using the Santiago Stock Exchange IGPA Index for 1/1992 – 5/2004
and the Santiago Stock Exchange IPSA index for June 2004 onward. The sample size is 829. See
text for details.
Table 3: The underlying variance decomposition is based upon a weekly VAR of order 2,
identified using a Cholesky factorization with the ordering as shown in the column heading. The
(i, j)-th value is the estimated contribution TO the variance of the 10-week-ahead real stock return
forecast error of country i coming FROM innovations to real stock returns of country j. The
mnemonics are defined as in Table 1.
Table 4: The underlying variance decomposition is based upon a weekly VAR of order 2,
identified using a Cholesky factorization with the ordering as shown in the column heading. The
(i, j)-th value is the estimated contribution TO the variance of the 10-week-ahead stock return
volatility forecast error of country i coming FROM innovations to the stock return volatility of
country j. We calculate Chile’s volatility using the Santiago Stock Exchange IGPA Index for
January 1992-May 2004, and using the Santiago Stock Exchange IPSA index for June 2004
onward. The mnemonics are defined as in Table 1.
Notes to Figures
Figure 1: We plot moving return and volatility Spillover Indexes, defined as the sum of all
variance decomposition “contributions to others” from Tables 3 and 4, respectively, estimated
using 200-week rolling windows. See text for details.
Figure 2: We plot a moving volatility Spillover Index, defined as the sum of all variance
decomposition “contributions to others” from Table 4, estimated using 75-week rolling windows.
See text for details.
Figure 3: We plot a moving volatility Spillover Index, defined as the sum of all variance
decomposition “contributions to others” from Table 4, estimated using 200-day rolling windows.
See text for details.
Figure 4: We plot maximum and minimum volatility spillovers across a variety of alternative
VAR orderings, estimated using 200-week rolling windows. In panel 4a we present results for
eighteen “rotated” orderings corresponding to moving US to last, and then moving UK to last,
and so on. In panel 4b we present results for fifty randomly-chosen orderings. See text for
details.
