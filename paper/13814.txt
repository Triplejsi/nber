International Trade in Durable Goods: Understanding Volatility, Cyclicality, and Elasticities
Charles Engel and Jian Wang
NBER Working Paper No. 13814
February 2008
JEL No. E32,F3,F4
ABSTRACT
Data for OECD countries document: 1. imports and exports are about three times as volatile as GDP;
2. imports and exports are pro-cyclical, and positively correlated with each other; 3. net exports are
counter-cyclical. Standard models fail to replicate the behavior of imports and exports, though they
can match net exports relatively well. Inspired by the fact that a large fraction of international trade
is in durable goods, we propose a two-country two-sector model, in which durable goods are traded
across countries. Our model can match the business cycle statistics on the volatility and comovement
of the imports and exports relatively well. In addition, the model with trade in durables helps to understand
the empirical regularity noted in the trade literature: home and foreign goods are highly substitutable
in the long run, but the short run elasticity of substitution is low. We note that durable consumption
also has implications for the appropriate measures of consumption and prices to assess risk-sharing
opportunities, as in the empirical work on the Backus-Smith puzzle. The fact that our model can match
data better in multiple dimensions suggests that trade in durable goods may be an important element
in open-economy macro models.

Introduction

One of the most established empirical regularities in international business cycle analysis is the countercyclical behavior of net exports. Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland (1992, 1994) (BKK henceforth) explain this
empirical finding with the dynamics of capital formation: in the face of a positive productivity shock, the
increase of investment exceeds the increase in saving.1 In contrast, the behavior of imports and exports
themselves has been largely neglected in the literature.2 They are much more volatile than GDP and both
are pro-cyclical, facts which are at odds with the predictions of standard models. Inspired by the evidence
that a large fraction of international trade is in durable goods, we propose a two-country two-sector model,
in which durable goods are traded across countries. Simulation results show that our model can match the
trade sector data much better than the standard models. Our model also sheds light on two other puzzles
in the literature: the elasticity puzzle and Backus-Smith puzzle.
We first document two robust empirical findings: 1. Real imports and exports are much more volatile
than total output. Their standard deviations are on average about two to three times as large as GDP’s
in our OECD-country dataset.3 2. Real imports and exports are pro-cyclical and also positively correlated
with each other. We label the first finding “trade volatility”, and the second one “positive comovement”.
These findings are very robust across our 25-OECD-country data. We also confirm in our dataset the
well-documented negative correlation between net exports and output.
In standard international business cycle models, imports and exports are far less volatile than in the data.
They are actually even less volatile than GDP. We demonstrate this in a variety of standard models–real
business cycle and sticky-price dynamic models. We emphasize that the issue is not resolved by building
versions of the model with high real exchange rate volatility. Although a more volatile exchange rate helps
to increase the volatility of imports and exports, it generates a negative correlation between imports and
exports. This is at odds with the finding of “positive comovement”.
We propose a model in which countries trade durable goods only. This setup is inspired by the fact
that a large portion of international trade is durable goods. Baxter (1995) shows that about two thirds of
trade is in durable goods (including capital goods.) Erceg, Guerrieri, and Gust (2006) document a more
recent (year 2004) breakdown of US imports and exports. They find that consumer non-durables account
1 Raffo

(2006) modifies BKK’s model with a preference function proposed by Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Huffman (1988)
(GHH henceforth). He finds that the modified model can also replicate the counter-cyclical net exports measured at constant
prices.
2 The only paper that examines import and export volatility to our knowledge, is Zimmermann (1999). That paper uses
exogenous exchange rate shocks to generate the volatility of imports and exports. This explanation is contradictory to the
positive correlation between imports and exports. We give more details later.
3 Similar results are also reported in Table 11.7 of Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland (1995), Heathcote and Perri (2002), and
Zimmermann (1999).

for only 28% of non-energy imports and 25% of non-energy exports. In contrast, consumer durables and
capital goods account for 32% and 30% of non-energy imports. For non-energy exports, they account for
respectively, 16% and 45%. Non-energy industrial supplies, which are used in producing durables, account
for the remaining 10% of imports and 14% of exports. We find similar patterns in our OECD country
dataset. Trade in durable goods on average accounts for more than 60% of imports and exports for OECD
countries. The share increases to 70% after excluding raw materials and energy products in the trade. The
importance of capital goods in international trade has also been documented by Eaton and Kortum (2001).
Boileau (1999) examines a model with trade in capital goods to explain the volatility of net exports and the
terms of trade. Erceg, Guerrieri, and Gust (2006) also emphasize that trade in capital goods helps model
to replicate trade volatility. They argue that trade balance adjustment may be triggered by investment
shocks from either home or foreign country and such adjustment may not cause substantial real exchange
rate fluctuations. Warner (1994) finds that global investment demand has been an important determinant
of U.S. exports since 1967. However, we find that a model with trade in capital goods but not consumer
durables is inadequate. In order to match the volatility of the trade data, a large share of traded goods
must be durable. But if we take all of those traded goods to be capital, then the model would require, for
example, that the U.S. obtains almost all capital goods from imports while simultaneously exporting large
quantities of capital.
Our model goes further by including both capital and durable consumption goods in international trade.4
In our two-country two-sector model, nondurable goods are nontraded. Durable consumption flows require
both home and foreign durable goods varieties and capital goods are aggregated from home and foreign
varieties of capital. Simulation results show that the benchmark model can successfully replicate “trade
volatility” and “positive comovement”. In addition, net exports in our model are counter-cyclical and as
volatile as in the data. So our model can match the trade sector data much better than the standard models.
This improvement is not at the cost of other desirable features of standard models. The aggregate variables
such as output, consumption, investment and labor, can also match the data well.
Our benchmark model can also replicate the behavior of short- and long-run elasticities documented in
the trade literature. One strand of literature estimates the long-run elasticity of substitution between the
home and foreign goods from permanent relative price changes, such as from tariff reductions. Those studies
usually find a large elasticity of about 8 (for instance Feenstra and Levinsohn, 1995 and Head and Ries, 2001.)
4 Baxter (1992) has durable consumption in a two-sector model. The model setup is very different form ours and is used to
address different issues. Sadka and Yi (1996) build a simple small-country real-business-cycle model with durable consumption
goods. They use this model to demonstrate that the increase of consumption durables due to a permanent decrease in their
prices may be an important element in explaining the 1980s US trade deficits.

2

But when the same elasticity is estimated from relative price fluctuations at the business cycle frequency,
the estimate is much smaller–even less than one (for instance, Bergin, 2006, Heathcote and Perri, 2002.)
Several studies have offered explanations for this puzzle, and ours is closely related. A common feature of
the hypotheses is that the long-run elasticity of substitution is high, but the short-run elasticity is low due
to some market frictions. Ruhl (2005) proposes a model in which firms have to pay a fixed cost to change
their export status. Benefits from changing export status are not enough to recover the fixed cost under
transitory shocks. So the elasticity of substitution between the home and foreign goods is low when shocks
are transitory. However, in the face of persistent chocks, firms will pay the fixed cost and change their export
status, which leads to a large increase of trade share even for a small, but permanent price change. Drozd
and Nosal (2007) use the friction of international marketing to reduce the response of output to relative price
changes. Ramanarayanan (2007) models this problem from the side of importers. In this model, importers
use foreign goods as intermediate inputs in production. Home and foreign intermediate goods are perfectly
substitutable in the long run, but switching between them in the short run is very costly. We follow the same
idea in our model, where we assume that the home and foreign goods are highly substitutable in the long run,
but in the short run there is a quadratic cost for adjusting the durable consumption and capital stocks. Unlike
the above studies, we do not provide a micro-story for the market friction. Our contribution is quantitative.
After calibrating the adjustment costs to match the volatility of durable consumption and investment, we
investigate whether our model can also deliver a reasonable short-run elasticity of substitution.
When agents can trade a complete set of contingent claims, but face potentially different goods prices,
in a variety of contexts models imply that relative cross-country consumption should be perfectly positively
correlated with the real exchange rate. Backus and Smith (1993) demonstrate this result in a model with
nontraded goods, while Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2002) show that even a DSGE model with incomplete
markets implies a strong but imperfect positive correlation. But, beginning with Backus and Smith (1993),
several studies find empirically that the correlation between relative consumption and the real exchange rate
is generally low, even negative in many countries. Some recent papers offer models to explain this correlation
when capital markets are not perfect, and only bonds are traded.5 Our model shares some of the features
of these models, but also offers some new insight. Consumption measured in national accounts data does
not capture the service flow from consumer durables. Our model does a good job of replicating the data
for measured consumption, which includes purchases of new durable goods. Positive wealth shocks increase
purchases of new consumer durables as well as nondurables, and drive up the relative price of nontraded
(nondurable) goods, as in Benigno and Thoenissen (2007). But the consumption flow from durable goods
5 For

instance, Corsetti, Dedola and Leduc (forthcoming), and Benigno and Thoenissen (2007).

3

adjusts slowly to shocks, so the behavior of “true” consumption can be quite different than that of measured
consumption.
Our model’s success in accounting for several aspects of international trade data suggests that it may
be important to incorporate trade in durable goods when constructing an open-economy model for policy
analysis. There are several challenges remaining, however. A well-known departure of the IRBC model from
the data is that cross-country outputs have low correlation in those models, while this correlation is positive
and relatively high in the data. Our model provides little insight on this issue. In this paper, we also take
trade in durable goods as exogenously given. Future work might endogenize the durability of traded goods,
relating the types of goods traded to the cost of storage and time to ship.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 displays statistics on “trade volatility” and
“positive comovement”. We show that the standard models and their simple extensions cannot simultaneously replicate those empirical findings. Section 3 describes our two-country two-sector benchmark model.
Section 4 explains our calibration of the model. Section 5 shows simulation results of the benchmark model
and Section 6 concludes.

Empirical Findings and Performance of Standard Models

In this section, we first show some facts about international real business cycles: 1. Real imports and exports
are about two to three times as volatile as GDP. 2. Both real imports and exports are pro-cyclical and
positively correlated with each other. 3. Real net exports are counter-cyclical. Then we investigate whether
standard models in the literature can replicate those features. We also present evidence that trade in durable
goods accounts for a large portion of imports and exports in OECD countries.

2.1

Empirical Findings

Our data-set includes quarterly real GDP, real imports, real exports, and real net exports of OECD 25
countries during the period between 1973Q1 and 2006Q3.6 The data are from OECD Economic Outlook
database. All variables are logged except net exports7 and H-P filtered with a smoothing parameter of 1600.
Table 1 shows the volatility of those variables and comovement of real imports and real exports with
GDP. The standard deviation of GDP on average, is 1.51%. Both real imports and exports are much more
6 Due

to data limitation, Austria starts from 1988Q1, Czech Republic starts from 1993Q1, and Hungary starts from 1991Q1.
The data of Germany are for West Germany only which end in 1991Q1. The data after unification (1991Q1-2006Q3) show
similar patterns.
7 Following the literature, we divide the net exports by GDP.

volatile than GDP. On average, the imports are 3.3 times, and exports are 2.7 times as volatile as GDP.
This result is not driven by outliers. The sample median is very close to the sample mean. The volatilities
of imports and exports in the US are close to the sample mean. However, the ratio of net exports to GDP
in the US is less volatile than it is in any other countries.
Two things stand out for comovement of real imports and real exports with GDP. First, both imports
and exports are pro-cyclical. This result is very robust: the imports are positively correlated with GDP
in all 25 countries. The average correlation is 0.63. The same is true for exports except in two countries:
Denmark and Mexico. The average correlation between exports and GDP is 0.39. Second, imports and
exports are positively correlated in all countries except Australia, Mexico, New Zealand and Spain. The
average correlation between imports and exports is 0.38. In this table, we also confirm a well-documented
finding in previous studies: net exports are counter-cyclical. This is true in all countries except Austria and
Hungary. The average correlation between net exports and GDP is -0.24.

2.2

Performance of Standard Models

We investigate whether some standard models can replicate the facts presented in Table 1. Table 2 shows
simulation results for these models. These simulations demonstrate that the standard models and their
extensions cannot replicate trade volatility and positive comovement simultaneously. Since the model setups
are very standard in the literature, we leave them in the appendix.
We consider two types of models: the IRBC model and the DSGE model. We use exactly the structure of
the bond-economy model in Heathcote and Perri (2002) as our standard IRBC model (labeled HP in Table
2.) This model has the same structure as BKK’s model, but limits the financial market to a real-bond market
only. Baxter and Crucini (1995) compare this incomplete financial market model with the model with perfect
risk-sharing and find they behave very similarly if the productivity shock is not extremely persistent or the
cross-country spillover of productivity shocks is high. Table 2 also reports results for the DSGE model. This
is the extension of the IRBC model that assumes monopolistic competition, trade in nominal bonds, Calvo
staggered price setting, and a monetary policy (Taylor) rule. Those models are often used in the studies of
monetary policy in open economies.
GHH is the DSGE model with the preference function proposed by Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Huffman
(1988). The function takes a form of
ut =

(Ct − ρLνt )1−σ
,
1−σ

(1)

where Ct is the consumption and Lt is the labor supply. We use the same class of utility function in our

5

benchmark model. We include this model to show that our benchmark model results are not driven by this
choice of utility function. We also report the results for two more extensions of the DSGE model: the model
with low intertemporal elasticity of substitution (Lo-elast) and one with an uncovered interest rate parity
shock (UIP). The standard international RBC model and DSGE models cannot replicate the volatility of
the real exchange rate. We use those two methods to increase this volatility to see if it helps the model’s
performance in matching the behavior of imports and exports.
Panel A of Table 2 reports the standard deviations of aggregate variables relative to that of GDP. In our
standard IRBC model (HP), imports and exports are even less volatile than GDP. The same discrepancy
has also been reported in Table 2 of Heathcote and Perri (2002).8 They find that the assumption of financial
autarky can improve the volatility of imports and exports in a very limited way. The added features in
DSGE model and GHH models cannot solve this problem. Imports and exports are still far less volatile
than what they are in the data. However, the GHH utility function does make the volatility of net exports
much closer to the data. This follows because imports and exports are more volatile (due to more variable
consumption in the GHH model), and imports and exports are less correlated than what they are in the
DSGE model.
Panel B shows the correlations of real imports, real exports, and real net exports with GDP, as well
as the correlation between real imports and exports. Imports and exports are measured at their steady
state prices (constant price). The models of HP, DSGE and GHH match the data in that real imports and
exports are pro-cyclical and positively correlated with each other. Net exports are counter-cyclical in these
models. That is, the standard models can replicate the “positive comovement” feature, though they fail the
“trade volatility”.9 Panel C reports the same statistics as Panel B, but imports, exports and net exports are
measured in terms of final consumption goods, instead of constant prices. The results are similar to those
in Panel B.
Besides the volatility of imports and exports relative to GDP, another feature missing from the standard
DSGE model is the high volatility of the real exchange rate. A natural question is whether we can increase
the volatility of imports and exports in a model with more volatile real exchange rates. We follow Chari,
Kehoe and McGrattan’s (2002) “elasticity method” to increase real exchange rate volatility by decreasing
the value of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution 1/σ. Some authors have also used an uncovered
interest rate parity (UIP) shock to generate exchange rate variations in DSGE models.10 In our simulation

(1999) finds similar results in a sticky price model.
(2006) finds that the real net exports measured with constant prices are pro-cyclical under the standard utility

function of ut =
. We find that this conclusion may be sensitive to the volatility of investment and the
1−σ
elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods.
10 For instance, see Kollmann (2004), Wang(2007). This approach is similar to Zimmerman’s (1999), which adds an exogenous
9 Raffo

results, we find that the volatilities of real imports, exports and the exchange rate all increase in those
models. Under certain calibrations of the UIP shock, the model can also replicate the pro-cyclical movement
of imports and exports, though the correlation between exports and output is nearly zero. However, there is
a striking departure of these models from the data: real imports and exports are highly negatively correlated
in those models.
Figure 1 shows the production structure in the standard models. Home and foreign intermediate goods
are used to produce final goods. The final goods are used for consumption and investment. There are two
factors affecting the volatility of imports: 1. the volatility of demand for final goods and, 2. the substitution
between home and foreign goods. Under the standard calibration, the majority (about 75%) of final goods
(and therefore imports) goes to consumption. Consumption is less volatile than GDP in the data. So if we
want to match the volatility of consumption, demand for final goods will not be very volatile. Given the low
volatility of demand for final goods, we can still have very volatile imports and exports if there is a lot of
substitution between home and foreign goods. This is actually what the high elasticity and the UIP models
do.
Exchange rate movements induce fluctuations in the relative price of imports and exports. In return, the
substitution between home and foreign goods increases the volatility of imports and exports. But when the
terms of trade changes, the imports and exports move in opposite directions. So this method produces a
negative correlation between imports and exports, which is contradictory to the data. Baxter and Stockman
(1989) find little evidence of systematic difference in the volatilities of real imports and exports when countries
switch from fixed to flexible exchange rate regimes, though the real exchange rates became substantially more
variable during this period. This finding also suggests that the high volatility of international trade flows is
unlikely to come from the exchange rate fluctuations.

2.3

Trade in Durable Goods in OECD Countries

Here we present some descriptive statistics on trade flows that help to motivate our model of trade in
durables. We obtain our 25 OECD country data from NBER-UN World Trade Data and use the latest
available data (year 2000) to calculate the share of durable goods in international trade. The original data
are at 4-digit SITC levels. We aggregate them into 1- and 2-digit levels for each country. Then we use the
information of the SITC classifications to classify imports and exports into durable and nondurable goods.
At the 1-digit SITC level, there are 10 categories (0-9). Categories 0 (FOOD AND LIVE ANIMALS), 1
(BEVERAGES AND TOBACCO), and 4 (ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE OILS, FATS AND WAXES) are
source of exchange-rate volatility.

7

obviously nondurable goods. It is also straightforward that category 7 (MACHINERY AND TRANSPORT
EQUIPMENT) belongs to durable goods. Category 2 is raw materials that exclude fuels such as petroleum.
Category 3 contains energy products such as coal, petroleum, gas, etc. The remaining categories however are
difficult to classify. This is particularly true for category 5 (CHEMICALS AND RELATED PRODUCTS,
N.E.S.). Even if we go down to the 3-digit level, it is still unclear which categories belong to durable goods.
We find that this category includes many nondurable goods, such as fertilizers, medicines, cleaning products,
etc. To avoid exaggerating the share of durable goods, we put the whole category 5 into nondurable goods.
But we note that this category does include some durable goods, such as plastic tubes, pipes, etc.
For categories 6, 8 and 9, we go down to the SITC 2-digit levels for more information about the durability
of goods. Category 6 (MANUFACTURED GOODS CLASSIFIED CHIEFLY BY MATERIALS) classifies
goods according to their materials. We assume that goods produced from leather, rubber, or metals are
durables (61-62 and 66-69). Goods produced from wood (other than furniture), paper, or textile (63-65) are
nondurables. Category 8 includes other manufactured products that are not listed in categories 6 and 7. We
assume that construction goods (81), furniture (82), professional instruments (87), photographic equipments
(88) are durable goods. Travel goods (83), clothing (84), footwear (85) and remaining goods (89) are classified
as nondurables. Category 9 includes products that are not classified elsewhere. In this category, we assume
that coins and gold (95-97) are durables. All remaining products are classified as nondurables.
Table 3 reports the share of durable goods in imports and exports in our 25 OECD country dataset.
On average durable goods account for about 60% of total imports and exports in these countries. If we
exclude raw materials (SITC 2) and energy products (SITC 3), the share increases to 70% (right panel of
Table 3). We find that about three quarters of trade is in durable goods in the US if we exclude energy
products, which is in line with the finding of Erceg, Guerrieri, and Gust (2006).11 We note some outliers for
exports. More than 50% of exports in Australia and New Zealand are in categories zero (FOOD AND LIVE
ANIMALS) and two (CRUDE MATERIALS, INEDIBLE, EXCEPT FUELS). 65% of exports in Iceland are
FOOD AND LIVE ANIMALS. Norway exports a significant amount of energy products. After we exclude
raw materials and energy products, Australia and Norway become close to our sample mean. Iceland and
New Zealand still export a much lower share of durable goods than other OECD countries. But our overall
results confirm that durable goods account for a large portion of international trade for OECD countries.
In particular, category 7 (MACHINERY AND TRANSPORT EQUIPMENT) on average accounts for more
than 40% of trade for OECD countries.
11 We

also find in another US dataset that durable good exports are much volatile than nondurable exports. See Appendix
A.1 for more details.

A Two-country Benchmark Model

There are two symmetric countries in our model, Home and Foreign. We depart from the standard models
in Section 2.2 by having two production sectors in each country: the nondurable good and durable good
sectors. All firms are perfectly competitive with flexible prices. Nondurable goods can only be used for
domestic consumption. Durable goods are traded across countries and used for durable consumption and
capital accumulation. Because of the symmetry between these two countries, we describe our model focusing
on the Home country.12
Our modeling strategy is motivated by the empirical regularities discussed in Section 2.1. As we have
noted, in order to explain the high volatility of imports and exports, it is not promising to rely on the response
of these variables to price changes. That would tend to make imports and exports negatively correlated, but
in fact they are positively correlated. Instead, we note that changes in capital stocks can be very volatile
in response to persistent changes in productivity. It is well known that investment is very volatile and
pro-cyclical. However, it would be unrealistic to attribute all of the movements in imports and exports to
trade in capital goods. In order to match the movements in trade volumes, we would need to ascribe an
unrealistically high share of trade to trade in capital goods, so we add trade in durable consumption goods
to the model.
The standard RBC models are able to capture the pro-cyclicality of imports and exports, and the countercyclicality of the trade balance by introducing capital goods. But they are unable to match the volatility
because most trade is in consumption goods, so the fraction of trade accounted for by investment goods is
too small to account for the overall volatility of trade volumes. However, recognizing that much of trade in
consumption goods is trade in consumer durables, we are able to simultaneously reconcile the volatility and
cyclical behavior of imports and exports.
We are able to match the business cycle facts on trade without giving up realism in other dimensions,
particularly in the characteristics of consumption behavior over the business cycle. That is because we
recognize that a large fraction of consumption is in services, which we model as a nondurable nontraded
good.
Trade in capital goods and consumer durables would introduce too much volatility in trade if we did
not allow for some sort of installation cost. This is a well-known feature of international RBC models. But
this also allows us to build a model consistent with another widely-recognized fact: that trade elasticities
are higher in the long run in response to persistent shocks than they are in the short run. In our model,
12 We

list all equilibrium conditions for both countries in Appendix A.3.

9

home and foreign durable consumption and capital goods are close substitutes, but the sensitivity over the
business cycle to relative price changes is low because of these costs of adjustment.
In addition, we introduce an iceberg cost of trade. Here, we want to capture the idea that there is “home
bias” in consumption of durables, as well as in the use of capital goods in production. Especially for large
economic areas such as the US or the European Union, imports are a relatively small component of the
overall consumption basket, or mix of inputs used in production. Because we model traded goods as being
highly substitutable in the long run, it does not seem natural to simultaneously introduce home bias directly
into the utility function or production function. Instead, and consistent with much of the recent literature
in trade, we posit that there are costs to trade which lead to this home bias even in the long run.
We note that there is a tension in modeling the behavior of trade volumes over the business cycle.
Imports and exports are pro-cyclical and their standard deviation (in logs) is much larger than that of GDP.
At the same time, they are apparently not very responsive in the short run to price changes. The model
of consumer durables and investment goods captures these features for reasonable parameter values. We
discuss the calibration in Section 4 below, after the presentation of the model.

Firms

If there were no adjustment costs to durables, durable consumption purchases would be very volatile in
response to shocks. Empirical work (see for example, Mankiw (1982) and Gali (1993)), finds that durable
consumption adjusts more smoothly and is less volatile than a model with no adjustment costs would imply.
Gali (1993) suggests that adjustment costs may account for the excess smoothness of durable consumption,
and indeed Startz (1989) finds that adjustment costs can account for the behavior of durable consumption
in a permanent income model. Bertola, Guiso, and Pistaferri (2005) find support on micro level data for a
model with a fixed cost of adjustment. Aggregate consumption is not likely to exhibit the same lumpiness
as micro data, so we adopt the standard quadratic adjustment cost formulation (as in Startz(1989).)

Calibration

We calibrate our model such that in the steady state, the structure of the economy is the same as in Figure
2. Details about how to solve the steady state can be found in Appendix A.3.2. In our benchmark economy,
nondurable goods account for 60% of total output and durable goods account for the remaining 40%. Among
the durable goods, half of them are used for consumption (equivalent to 20% of total output) and the other
half are used for investment (equivalent to 20% of total output).15 Among durable consumption goods,
65% are used for domestic consumption (equivalent to 13% of total output) and 35% are used for exports
(equivalent to 7% total output). Among durable investment goods, 70% are used for domestic investment
(equivalent to 14% of total output) and 30% are used for exports (equivalent to 6% of total output). In this
economy, investment accounts for 20% of total output and consumption (durable plus nondurable) accounts
15 Durable consumption in our calibration is higher than the US data, which is about 15% of output. However, many goods
with characteristics of durables-such as shoes and clothing-are classified as nondurables in the data.

14

for the remaining 80%. The trade share of output is 13%. Those features match the US data closely.
Table 4 shows parameter values that we use to match our benchmark model with the described economy
structure. We set the shares of home goods in capital (α) and durable consumption (ψ) at 50%. That is,
there is no home bias exogenously built in our economy structure. Instead, we generate the observed low
trade share from the iceberg trade cost τ . We will discuss this more later. As in Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland
(1992), the capital share in production (χ = ) is set to 36%, and the subjective discount factor is set to
0.99, which gives a 4% annual real interest rate. The depreciation rate of durable consumption (δD ) is set
to 0.05, which implies a 20% annual depreciation rate for consumption durables. A similar depreciation rate
has been used in Bernanke (1985) and Baxter (1996).
Given those parameters, we choose other parameters to match the economy structure as in Figure 2. We
first choose the preference parameter µ and the depreciation rate of capital (δ) jointly to match the relative
size of durable and nondurable good sectors, and the size of investment in durable goods. µ is set to 0.23 and
δ is set to 0.013 such that 1. the durable good sector accounts for 40% of total output and, 2. the investment
accounts for 50% of durable goods, or equivalently 20% of total output. Consumption durables account for
the remaining 50% of durable goods, or equivalently 20% of total output.
The trade cost (τ ) and the elasticity of substitution between the home and foreign goods are calibrated
to match two empirical findings: 1. the trade share of total output is about 13%; 2. the long-run elasticity
of substitution between the home and foreign goods is high. In our calibration, the long-run elasticity of
substitution between the home and foreign capital (γ) is set to 9.1. The elasticity of substitution between
the home and foreign durable consumption (θ) is set to 6.85. In the steady state, the trade in capital goods
(durable consumption goods) accounts for 46% (54%) of total trade. The above calibration of γ and θ implies
an overall elasticity of 7.9, which is the same as in Head and Reis (2001).16 The trade cost (τ ) is calibrated
to 0.1, that is, 90% of goods arrive in their destination countries in the international trade. For given γ and
θ, this trade cost generates a trade share of 13%.
We use different values for γ and θ to generate different home bias levels for capital and durable consumption. Capital is more biased towards home goods than durable consumption (70% vs 65%). For given trade
cost, the degree of home bias increases with the elasticity of substitution. So we assign a higher elasticity of
substitution to capital goods. Alternatively, we can assume the same elasticity of substitution, but higher
trade cost for capital goods. In either method, capital can have a higher level of home bias than durable
consumption. We used the first method because it matches a pattern observed in the data. For a given
decrease in trade cost, the first method predicts that the share of investment goods in international trade
16 9.1

× 46% + 6.85 × 54% ≈ 7.9.

15

increases relative to the share of durable consumption. Intuitively, investment goods are more substitutable
across countries than durable consumption under this setup. So when the trade cost decreases, there is more
substitution for investment goods than for durable consumption. As a result, the share of investment goods
in the trade increases. Figure 3 plots this prediction from the model. The same pattern is also found in the
US data: from 1994 to 2006-the share of capital goods except automotive in total export goods increased
from 34.4% to 45.1%.17
The preference parameters σ and ν are set to their standard levels used in the GHH utility function. The
parameter ρ is chosen such that the labor supply is one third in the steady state. We assume that the elasticity
of substitution between the durable and nondurable consumption is low (ζ = 1.1).18 The adjustment cost
parameters of durable consumption (φ1 ) is chosen to match the volatility of durable consumption, which is
about three times as volatile as output in the data. The adjustment cost of capital stock (φ2 ) is calibrated
to match the volatility of investment, which is about three times as volatile as output in the data.
We follow Erceg and Levin (2006) in calibrating the productivity shocks in the durable and nondurable
goods sectors. However, there is no information about the cross-country spillovers of those shocks in their
closed-economy model. Empirical findings usually suggest small cross-country spillovers. For instance,
Baxter and Crucini (1995) find no significant international transmission of shocks, except for possible transmission between US and Canada. In Kollman’s (2004) estimate between the US and three EU countries, the
spillover is 0.03. In Corsetti, Dedola, and Leduc (forthcoming), the spillover is −0.06 for traded goods and
0.01 for nontraded goods. We will first set those spillovers at zero and then choose some values used in the
literature to check whether our results are robust under different shock structures.

Performance of Benchmark Model

The model is solved and simulated using the first-order perturbation method. The model’s artificial time
series are logged (except for net exports) and Hodrick-Prescott (H-P) filtered with a smoothing parameter
of 1600. The reported statistics in this section are averages across 100 simulations. Our benchmark model

17

performs well in three broad categories. First, the model can match the observed IRBC statistics, including
the “trade volatility” and “positive comovement” of imports and exports as documented in Section 2.1.
Second, the model can replicate the elasticity puzzle in the trade literature. Finally, our model can replicate
the Backus-Smith puzzle and offers some new insights on this puzzle.

5.1

International RBC Statistics

Table 5 shows simulation results for five models. All of these models can match data fairly well in the
following respects:
1. The models can replicate the volatility (relative to that of GDP) of aggregate variables such as consumption, investment, durable consumption, and labor.
2. Real imports, exports and net exports are as volatile as in the data. That is, our model can successfully
replicate the excessive volatility of imports and exports.
3. Both imports and exports are pro-cyclical and positively correlated with each other. Net exports are
counter-cyclical.
4. The CPI-based real exchange rate is more volatile than GDP.
A noticeable difference between our benchmark model and the models with cross-country correlation of
technology shocks is that the volatility of imports and exports decreases when we allow spillovers.20 This
result is consistent with BKK’s finding that net exports become less volatile when cross-country spillovers
increase. But even when we set the spillover coefficient at 0.088, which is relatively large in the literature,
imports and exports are still about two times as volatile as output. If we set the spillover coefficient to a
moderate level of 0.044, the simulation results are very close to our benchmark results.
In all of our calibrations, we note the following shortcomings: As in almost all RBC models, real exchange
rate volatility is still lower than in the data. However, our model does quite well relative to the literature. The
standard deviation of the real exchange rate in our benchmark model is roughly 50% of the standard deviation
in the data. Across all specifications, our model produces somewhat lower correlations of real imports with
GDP than appear in the data. And, perhaps as a consequence, net exports are not as negatively correlated
with GDP as in the data.
Cross-country output correlation is nearly zero in the standard IRBC models,21 though this correlation
is usually large in the data. Our model provides little insight on this issue. We find that the cross-country
20 The

difference is more significant if we keep the adjustment costs the same across models.
instance, the cross-country output correlation in BKK (1992) is -0.18.

18

correlation of output increases if we allow innovations to be correlated across countries. For instance, if we
set cross-country correlation of innovations to 0.258 for both durable good and nondurable good sectors in
the model of Medium Spillover 2, the cross-country output correlation increases from 0.01 to 0.2. However,
it is still far less than it in the data. Kose and Yi (2003) find that their model can generate stronger crosscountry correlations for pairs of countries that trade more. But the increased correlation still falls far short
of the empirical findings.
We also considered a different model for the adjustment costs of capital and durable consumption stocks.
Under this setup, it is costly to adjust the proportion of home to foreign capital (durable consumption).
This is a crude way of capturing the notion that it takes time to change technologies. As a result, the
proportion of home to foreign durables only changes gradually. Ramanarayanan (2007) models this idea
more explicitly with a putty-clay technology. In addition, we use adjustment costs for the total stock
of capital (durable consumption) to match the volatility of investment. This new setup generates results
similar to our benchmark model. New results are reported in Table 5 under the name of “New Costs”.
Cross-country output correlation in New Costs model (0.08) comes slightly closer to the data than in the
benchmark model (0.01). However we also need to note that we have more freedom in calibrating “New
Costs” model because it has more cost parameters than our benchmark model.
When productivity shocks are persistent, it is well understood that investment will be volatile. Agents
wish to change the capital stock quickly to take advantage of current and anticipated productivity shocks.
This effect contributes to the high volatility our model produces for imports and exports, because capital
goods are traded. A positive productivity shock leads to a desire to increase Home’s stock of domestically
produced and foreign produced capital. This leads to the increase in demand for imports when there is a
positive productivity shock. A positive productivity shock also increases the supply of Home’s export good,
lowering its world price, and thus increasing exports.
These effects are standard in RBC models, and explain why the models can generate procyclical imports
and exports. However, if only investment goods are durable, and consumption goods are nondurable, the
model does not produce sufficient volatility in imports and exports. For instance, if we change the depreciation rate of durable consumption (δD ) to one and the adjustment cost to zero, the (relative) standard
deviation of imports and exports decreases from 2.6 to 2.22 When we introduce a consumer durable sector,
there is an additional source of volatility. Demand for consumer durables, like demand for investment goods,
22 In this exercise, the capital adjustment cost is changed such that the (relative) standard deviation of investment is the same
as in our benchmark model (2.6). We also change the elasticity of substitution between the home and foreign consumption goods
to 0.9, which reflects the fact that the short-run elasticity of substitution is low in our benchmark model due to adjustment
costs.

19

is forward looking. It is not expected productivity per se, but rather higher wealth from higher expected
future income that leads to volatility in demand for durable consumer goods.
Consider the effect of a positive productivity shock in the production of durable goods. Because the
shock is persistent, there is a significant wealth effect that pushes up demand for both home and foreign
durable consumption goods. In addition, there is an increase in the relative price of nondurable goods,
which leads to substitution from nondurables to durables. The price of home-produced durables relative to
foreign-produced durables also increases, which leads to substitution toward home-produced durables. But
overall, the wealth effect and the effect of the decline in the price of nondurables lead to an increase in
import demand, despite the increase in the price of foreign durables relative to home durables. Indeed, total
expenditure on imports increases more than the value of exports, leading to a decline in the trade balance.
However, part of that increase in import expenditure comes from the increased price of imports. But overall,
the model still generates procyclical movements of import and export quantities.
Figure 5 shows the correlations between US GDP and real imports, exports and net exports at various
leads and lags. As noted by Ghironi and Melitz (2007), the correlation between GDP and imports exhibits a
tent-shaped pattern, while the correlations of exports and net exports with GDP are S-shaped.23 Our model
captures these qualitative patterns well. Note in particular that the model captures the fact that, while
current imports are positively correlated with GDP, imports are negatively correlated with lagged GDP at
longer horizons. However, our model’s correlation of both imports and exports with lagged GDP declines
quickly - too quickly - as the horizon increases. It appears especially that exports increase with a lagged
response to a positive shock to GDP. It might be possible to capture this dynamic behavior by incorporating
a lag between orders of durable goods and delivery.

5.2

Elasticity Puzzle

The elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods is defined as the percentage change of demand
for imports relative to home goods, given a one percent change of the import price relative to the homegood price. Two methods have been used in the literature to estimate this elasticity. In the literature of
trade liberalization, studies investigate how much the demand for foreign goods increases after a permanent
relative price change caused by tariff reduction. In the data, the trade share of output increases substantially
over time after a small but permanent decrease in the tariff. This empirical finding suggests that home and
foreign goods are highly substitutable. So the estimates from this strand of literature range from 6 to 15
with an average of 8. For instance, see Feenstra and Levinsohn (1995), Head and Ries (2001), Lai and Trefler
23 Ghironi

and Melitz (2007) have also implicitly observed the procylicality of imports and exports in their Figure 1.

20

(2002).24
In another strand of literature, the same elasticity is estimated from transitory relative price changes at
the business cycle frequency. We show with a simple example in Appendix A.4 that under a general setup
used in the literature, those two methods are estimating the same parameter. However, estimates from
business cycle frequency data are much smaller, in a range of 0.2 to 3.5. These findings have been labeled
as the “elasticity puzzle” in the trade literature.
Several studies have offered explanations for this puzzle with a common feature that the long-run elasticity
of substitution is high, but the short-run elasticity is low due to some market frictions. Our model is closely
related. By the calibration of our model, home and foreign goods are highly substitutable in the long run.
The short-run frictions in our model are adjustment costs of durable consumption and capital stocks. We
calibrate those costs to match the volatility of investment and durable consumption. Under these conditions,
we investigate whether adjustment costs can also deliver a reasonable short-run elasticity.
To calculate the short-run elasticity of substitution, we regress the (log) relative demand on the (log)
relative price. We need the following variables in our regression: demand for foreign goods, domestic demand
for home goods and the relative price. The demand for foreign goods is measured by real imports (RIMt ).
The domestic demand for home goods is measured by domestic absorption (DAt ), which is calculated by
subtracting real imports from the sum of consumption and investment

DAHt = T CHt + IHt − RIMHt ,

(27)

where T CHt and IHt are total consumption and investment respectively. We define the price of domestic
absorption as

24 Yi (2003) also points out that to replicate this empirical finding in a general equilibrium (GE) model, we need an elasticity
of more than 14, which is counterfactually high. He argues that measured trade grossly overstates the value added component
of exports, because many exports include a lot of imported contents due to vertical specialization. This overcounting of trade
may be able to explain why a small tariff reduction leads to a large increase of trade share in the data.
25 A constant is also added in the regression. As in empirical studies, our estimate is subject to the endogeneity problem. We
do not control this problem here, because the goal of this exercise is to find whether we can replicate empirical findings instead

21

estimated short-run elasticity of substitution is 1.05 with a standard error of 0.20. In the empirical studies
with disaggregate data, the average of estimates is about 0.85. For instance, the cross-industry average in
Reinert and Roland-Holst (1992) is 0.91 and it is 0.81 in Blonigen and Wilson (1999). In aggregate models,
Heathcote and Perri (2002) find a point estimate of 0.9. Bergin (2006) estimates a New Open Economy
Macro model and obtains an estimate of 1.13. So the short-run elasticity of substitution implied by our
model is very close to what is found in the data.
It is not surprising, of course, that we are able to generate an elasticity that is lower in the short run
than in the long run by introducing costs of adjustment. Our point is simply that in a model in which trade
is in durables, this is natural and accords with a long tradition in macroeconomics of modeling the gradual
accumulation of capital. That is, the trade elasticity puzzle is easy to understand in a context in which trade
is in durables which are accumulated slowly over time.

5.3

Backus-Smith Puzzle

Backus and Smith (1993) show in a model with nontraded goods that the real exchange rate should be
perfectly correlated with cross-country relative consumption if households can trade a full set of contingent
claims. This prediction is at odds with the data: the correlation of the real exchange rate and relative
consumption among OECD countries is generally negative. Corsetti, Dedola, and Leduc (forthcoming) find
the median of this correlation between US consumption relative to each of the OECD countries and the
corresponding real exchange rate is −0.42. These empirical findings are often interpreted as evidence of
insufficient instruments to share idiosyncratic risk internationally. However, Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan
(2002) show that a DSGE model with only non-state-contingent bond markets generates a strong positive
correlation between relative consumption and the real exchange rate. Some recent papers offer models to
solve this puzzle. Corsetti, Dedola, and Leduc (forthcoming) find that if the elasticity of substitution between
the home and foreign goods is small enough, the terms of trade improve, instead of deteriorate, in the face of
a positive productivity shock in the home country. This could generate a negative correlation between the
real exchange rate and relative consumption. Begnigo and Thoenissen (2007) show that even if the terms of
trade deteriorate after a positive shock in the trade sector, the Balassa-Samuelson and wealth effects could
be strong enough to generate a real appreciation in a model with nontraded goods. They argue that the
price of nontraded goods increases after a positive shock in the tradable good sector, which calls for an
appreciation of the real exchange rate. This effect could dominate the deterioration of the terms of trade
and induce a real appreciation.
of obtaining the true elasticity in our model.

22

In this paper, we can also replicate the Backus-Smith empirical findings. The dynamics of consumption
and the real exchange rate in response to a shock to productivity in the durable sector look very much like
those in Benigno and Thoenissen (2007). A positive shock lowers the price of the durable export, and because
of home bias, that tends to work toward a real CPI depreciation. But that effect can be more than offset by
the increase in the price of nondurable goods, which are not traded across countries. There are two forces
working to push up the price of non-traded goods: First, there is the traditional Balassa-Samuelson effect.
The increase in productivity pushes up the real wage, thus pushing up the relative price of non-tradables. In
addition, overall consumption in the home country increases from a wealth effect, because higher productivity
increases lifetime income for the home country. Even if there were no factors mobile between sectors, that
would tend to push up the price of the nontradable goods, and help foster a real appreciation. We have that
aggregate consumption is increasing, and under our calibrations, a real appreciation – these correspond to
the data.
However, our model also offers some new insight on this puzzle. The durable consumption measured
in national accounts data is expenditures on new durable consumption goods. However, it is the service
flow from the stock of durable consumption that enters the utility function. As emphasized by Obstfeld
and Rogoff (2006, page 98), the consumer smooths the service flow from the stock of durable consumption,
instead of the path of expenditures on durables. As in the data, the total consumption is measured by the
sum of nondurable consumption and the investment in durable consumption

T CHt = CHt + DCHt ,

(29)

where T CHt is the total consumption in Home country. CHt is nondurable consumption and DCHt is durable
consumption. Durable consumption is defined as the sum of Home- and Foreign-good durable consumption

DCHt = P̂Ht
(dHt + ∆H

From the utility function, we know the “true” consumption (utility consumption) is

We calculate the correlation of 1. the (log) CPI-based real exchange rate and the (log) relative total
consumption (log(T CHt ) − log(T CF t )), and 2. the utility-based real exchange rate and the (log) relative

23

utility consumption (log(U CHt ) − log(U CF t )).26 The correlation between the real exchange rate and total
consumption differential (log(T CHt )−log(T CHt )) is -0.23. So our model can replicate the negative correlation
between the real exchange rate and consumption documented in the data. However, the correlation between
the utility-based real exchange rate and the utility consumption differential (log(U CHt ) − log(U CHt )) is
0.26. Based on the fact that the financial market is limited to trade in non-state-contingent real bonds and
leisure is nonseparable in the utility function, a correlation of 0.26 still implies a relatively good amount of
risk sharing between the Home and Foreign countries.
It is interesting that true consumption acts more like it does in the model with complete contingent
claims, though measured relative consumption and the real exchange rate are negatively correlated. We do
not see an increase in utility consumption after a positive shock. In fact, it may decrease. First, consumption
of services from durables cannot change, because it is predetermined by the stock of durables. While there
is a positive wealth effect that would tend to increase the consumption of nondurables, this is more than
offset by the increase in their relative price. That is, the substitution effect dominates the wealth effect, and
demand for nondurables falls. In Figure 4, we show impulse response functions for a one-standard-deviation
shock in the durable good sector of home country. In the face of the shock, home total consumption increases
relative to foreign consumption. The price of nondurable increases (or the price of durable decreases.) The
consumption of nondurable goods decreases, in that the substitution effect dominates the wealth effect.27
Although the terms of trade deteriorate, the real exchange rate appreciates due to a strong increase in the
price of nondurable goods.

Conclusion

The behavior of imports and exports is, of course, a key component of the linkages among economies. Our
model confronts and, to a degree, successfully explains some strong empirical regularities. By modeling
trade in durables, we can understand the high volatility of imports and exports relative to output. Trade
in durables also offers a natural explanation for the trade elasticity puzzle – that the response of imports to
changes in the terms of trade is low at business cycle frequencies, but is high when considering the long-run
effect of permanent price changes. Our model performs well compared to other models, because it offers an
explanation that is also consistent with the observation that imports and exports are both procyclical, and
positively correlated with each other, even when the terms of trade and real exchange rate are as volatile as

the shock is very persistent, the wealth effect could dominate the substitution effect and the nondurable consumption
increases.

in the data.
We believe the forward-looking nature of investment decisions and decisions to purchase consumer
durables are a key feature of trade behavior. Our model noticeably fails to account for the high correlation of output across countries, which is a failure shared by essentially all rational expectations equilibrium
models. However, we think that modeling trade as durables may still be a promising avenue for dealing with
this puzzle as well, through channels that are not explored in this paper. One possibility is that while the
common (across countries) component of productivity shocks may account for a small share of the variance of
productivity, it may be that agents typically receive strong signals about the future common component. If
news helps to drive business cycles (as in Beaudry and Portier, 2005), then perhaps news about the common
component of productivity shocks helps contribute to the high correlation of business cycles across countries.
News about future productivity is especially important for durables, so the impact of news may be especially
strong on the investment and consumer durables sectors.
Another avenue that may deserve further exploration is a model with nominal price stickiness, as in
DSGE models. Our model of durable trade creates large swings in demand for imports, which indeed is
what allows it to account for trade volatility. But an increase in Home demand for Foreign output has only a
small effect on Foreign’s output level. Instead, in our model, prices adjust so that more of Foreign’s output is
channeled toward Home. In a model with sticky prices, changes in demand may lead to changes in aggregate
output, and so create a channel for international spillovers. While these channels do exist in current DSGE
models, they are not strong because the models do not account for large procyclical movements in imports
and exports.
It is an empirical fact that a large fraction of trade is in durables. Indeed, we view explaining this
phenomenon - rather than assuming it, as we do in this study - to be another interesting topic for future
research. What we have accomplished here is to demonstrate that trade in durables significantly alters the
behavior of imports and exports in an RBC model in a way that can account for some striking empirical
facts.

APPENDIX
A.1

Volatility of Durable/Nondurable Goods in US Trade

We find quarterly nominal US trade data at the 2-digit SITC level from the US International Trade Commission (http://www.usitc.gov/). Import and export price indexes at 2-digit SITC level are obtained from
Bureau of the Census through Haver Analytics. Nominal trade data are deflated by corresponding price
indexes to calculate real imports and exports.28 In the end, we have real import and export data at 2-digit
SITC level for 1997Q1-2006Q2.
Imports and exports are classified into three categories: raw materials, durable goods and nondurable
goods according to the standard described in Section 2.3. During our sample period, durable goods account
for 64.23% of total exports and 57.22% of total imports. This is consistent with our findings in the NBERUnited Nations World Trade Data. Real imports and exports are logged and H-P filtered with a smoothing
parameter of 1600. Then we calculate the standard deviation for each category. In exports, raw materials
and durable goods are much more volatile than nondurable goods: the standard deviations of raw materials
and durable goods are respectively 7.78% and 6.54%. It is only 2.86% for nondurable goods. Imports show
less dispersion in volatility: the standard deviations of raw materials and durable goods are 5.02% and 5.00%
respectively. It is 4.89% for nondurable goods. These statistics are not precise given our rough classification
of goods into the durable and nondurable categories, and given that we use only 38 observations of H-P
filtered data.

A.2

Standard Models

In this section, we describe the standard models used in Section 2.2.

A.2.1

IRBC Model

The standard IRBC model is the bond-economy model in Heathcote and Perri (2002). There are two
symmetric countries, Home and Foreign. In each country, there are two sectors, the intermediate and final
good sectors. Because of symmetry, we focus on the Home country in describing the model. Intermediate
28 In a few cases, the 2-digit level price index is missing. Imports and exports are deflated with the corresponding 1-digit level
price indexes in these cases.

(A.2.4)

The Home and Foreign country can trade real bonds of the Home country’s intermediate goods. To make
the model stationary, we assume a small bond holding cost as in Heathcote and Perri (2002). We calibrate
the model with the same parameter values as in Heathcote and Perri (2002). Our simulation results are very
close to those reported in their paper.

A.2.2

DSGE Model

It is a two-country symmetric model. We will focus on the Home country in describing our model. There
is a continuum of differentiated intermediate goods indexed by i ∈ [0, 1]. The Home intermediate good i
(YH (i)) is produced by a single firm with capital Kt (i) and labor Lt (i) in the Home country. Capital and
labor are not internationally mobile. Intermediate goods are aggregated into an intermediate good composite

(A.2.5)

The intermediate-good market is monopolistically competitive. The firms choose prices to maximize expected
discounted profit. We follow Calvo staggered price setting in this sticky-price model. In each period, the
firm has a probability of 1 − λ of changing its price. When λ = 0, the model reduces to the flexible price
setup.

interest rate follows the Taylor rule

it = i + Ξπ log(πt /π) + Ξy log(gdpt /gdp),

39

(A.2.9)

where πt is the inflation rate at time t.
The first order conditions of the household approximately imply uncovered interest rate parity. In the
UIP model, we break this condition with an uncovered interest rate parity shock by following Kollmann
(2004). The values that we use to calibrate the DSGE model are listed in Table 6. Those parameter values
are standard in the literature.

Benchmark Model

In this section, we give more details about our benchmark model in Section 3. We first list equations that
define the equilibrium of the model, then solve for its nonstochastic steady state.

A.3.1

Equilibrium Conditions

N
We divide all prices by the price of nondurable consumption goods (PHt
in the Home country and PFNt in the

Foreign). That is, we use the nondurable consumption good as numeraire. We use a hat above all prices to
denote that they are relative prices in terms of nondurable consumption. The equilibrium of the benchmark
model is defined by the following equations.

In the steady state, the return to capital in the nondurable-good sector is the same as that in the durablegood sector. This result is intuitive since there is no long-run restriction on moving capital between these
two sectors. Similarly, we can find that the return to Foreign capital goods is also the same across these two
sectors

Because of the trade cost, the return to the Foreign-good capital has to be higher than the return to the
Home-good capital. As shown in the calibration, this trade cost generates home bias endogenously in the
durable good sector.

the elasticity. This exercise has been done with industrial-level data in several papers, for instance, Reinert
and Roland-Holst (1992), Blonigen and Wilson (1999), Reinert and Shiells (1993). The estimates from
quarterly data are usually small with an average of around 0.85. In aggregate models, this parameter is
usually calibrated in the range between 0.5 to 2. Bergin (2006) estimates a two-country general equilibrium
model. His estimate is 1.13. Heathcote and Perri (2002) also estimate this parameter with aggregate data
and find an estimate of 0.9. So at the business cycle frequency, the empirical findings both at disaggregate
and aggregate levels point to a small elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods.
Ruhl (2005) uses a regression to find the elasticity of substitution in his model. Drozd and Nosal (2007)
propose a measurement that follows this spirit, but they do not run a regression. Instead, from equation
F
H
F
H
(A.4.3), the standard deviation of log(YHt
/YHt
) divided by the standard deviation of log(PHt

) is also

equal to γ under the model’s setup. We use both methods in our benchmark model and find our results are
robust.
The second strand of literature estimates the elasticity of substitution through the (long-run) response
50

of trade flows to permanent relative price changes. One example is a tariff reduction. Let’s assume that the
rate of tariff is τ and the law of one price holds after taking into account the tariff, that is,

F
PHt
= (1 + τ )St PFFt ,

(A.4.5)

where PFFt is the price of foreign goods in the foreign country and St is the exchange rate. Substitute this
to equation (A.4.3), we have

ranges from 6 to 15. For instance, see Feenstra and Levinsohn (1995), Head and Ries (2001), and Lai and
Trefler (2002). Yi (2003) shows that the trade share of output increased substantially for a small decrease
in tariffs. He points out that to replicate those findings in a general equilibrium model, the elasticity of
substitution between the home and foreign goods must be very large. These results are strikingly different
from those obtained from first stand of literature, though under the setup of our example, they are estimating
the same parameter γ. This discrepancy has been labeled the elasticity puzzle in the literature.

Backus-Smith Puzzle

In this section, we describe how to calculate the utility-based real exchange rate used in Section 5.3. The
calculation is straightforward if we ignore the frictions in the economy. Suppose that the household is
51

renting the durable consumption from a competitive market instead of owning it. The rent cost in terms of
the nondurable goods will be the marginal utility of durable consumption divided by the marginal utility of
nondurable consumption
