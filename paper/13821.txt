Income Maximization and the Selection and Sorting of International Migrants
Jeffrey Grogger and Gordon H. Hanson
NBER Working Paper No. 13821
February 2008, Revised October 2010
JEL No. F22,J61
ABSTRACT
Two prominent features of international labor movements are that the more educated are more likely
to emigrate (positive selection) and more-educated migrants are more likely to settle in destination
countries with high rewards to skill (positive sorting). Using data on emigrant stocks by schooling
level and source country in OECD destinations, we find that a simple model of income maximization
can account for both phenomena. Results on selection show that migrants for a source-destination
pair are more educated relative to non-migrants the larger is the absolute skill-related difference in
earnings between the destination country and the source. Results on sorting indicate that the relative
stock of more-educated migrants in a destination is increasing in the absolute earnings difference between
high and low-skilled workers. We use our framework to compare alternative specifications of international
migration, estimate the magnitude of migration costs by source-destination pair, and assess the contribution
of wage differences to how migrants sort themselves across destination countries.

1. Introduction
International migration is a potentially important mechanism for global economic
integration. As of 2005, individuals residing outside their country of birth accounted for
3% of the world’s population. Most of those migrants left home bound for rich nations.
The UN estimates that in 2005, 40.9% of the global emigrant population resided in just
eight rich economies,1 with 20.2% living in the U.S. alone. In major destination
countries, the number of foreign born is rising, reaching 12.5% of the total population in
the U.S., 11.2% in Germany, 10.5% in France, and 8.2% in the U.K.
One striking feature of international labor flows is that the more educated are
those most likely to move abroad. Using data from Docquier and Marfouk (2006) on
emigration by schooling group, Figure 1 plots the share of tertiary-educated emigrants
against the share of tertiary-educated non-emigrants by source country. Emigrants are
generally positively selected in terms of schooling; that is, that they are more educated
than their non-migrant counterparts. This observation has renewed interest in the impact
of brain drain on developing economies.2
A second – and perhaps less appreciated – feature of international migration is the
sorting of emigrants across destinations. Countries with high rewards to skill attract a
disproportionate share of more-educated emigrants. Table 1, also based on data from
Docquier and Marfouk (2006), gives the share of international migrants residing in
OECD countries by major destination region. The U.S. and Canada, where skill-related
wage differences are relatively large, receives 51 percent of the OECD’s immigrants, but

These countries are the US, Germany, France, Canada, the UK, Spain, Australia, and Italy. Freeman
(2006) notes that Russia and several Middle Eastern countries also receive large numbers of immigrants.

Recent empirical work on brain drain includes Adams (2003), Beine, Docquier and Rapoport (2001, 2007,
2008), Docquier and Rapoport (2007), and Kapur and McHale (2005).

2
66 percent of its immigrants with tertiary schooling. Europe, where skill-related wage
differences are relatively small, receives 38 percent of the OECD’s immigrants, but only
24 percent of its tertiary-schooled immigrants. Europe’s failure to receive educated
migrants may explain its recent efforts to attract skilled foreigners.3
In this paper, we develop and estimate a simple model of migration based on the
Roy (1951) income maximization framework. The Roy model, which is the foundation
for a large body of migration research (Borjas, 1999), implies that the selectivity of
migrants and their sorting across destinations should depend on cross-country differences
in the reward to skill. Our version of the model predicts that an increase in the reward to
skill in a destination should cause immigration from source countries to rise and the mix
of migrants to become more skilled.
The model delivers estimating equations for the scale of migration, the selection
of migrants in terms of schooling, and the sorting of migrants across destinations by
schooling. While the three equations estimate a common coefficient on earnings, they
differ in terms of the data they require and the assumptions one must impose regarding
migration costs. The scale regression requires data on earnings by schooling level in the
source and destination and an assumption that the determinants of fixed migration costs
are observable. The selection regression differences out fixed migration costs. The
sorting regression does so as well, and also controls for source-specific determinants of
migration, including source-country earnings. We analyze newly available data from
Beine, Docquier and Rapoport (2007) on the stock of migrants by education level from
192 source countries residing in OECD destination countries as of 2000.

3
To preview the findings, the data strongly support income maximization. In the
scale regression, migration is increasing in the level earnings difference between the
destination and the source, although the estimated effect of earnings appears to be
attenuated due to omitted fixed costs of migration. In the selection and sorting
regressions, which difference out fixed costs, the relative stock of more-educated
migrants is larger in destinations with greater skill-related earnings differences. We also
find post-tax earnings are a stronger correlate of migration than pre-tax earnings,
consistent with migrants weighing tax treatment. Further results address the role of
language, distance, migration policy, historical relationships, and lagged migration.
One contribution of our paper is to address conflicting results on migrant
selectivity. In seminal work, Borjas (1987) develops a version of the Roy model which
predicts that migrants who move from a country with high returns to skill to a destination
with low returns to skill should be negatively selected. Although the Borjas (1987)
framework performs well in explaining migration from Puerto Rico to the U.S. (Ramos,
1992; Borjas, 2006), it does less well elsewhere. Migrants from Mexico to the U.S. are
drawn from the middle of the skill distribution, even though returns to skill are higher in
Mexico than the US. 4 Figure 1 shows that OECD-bound migrants are positively selected,
even though many are from countries where returns to skill exceed those in the OECD.
Our results suggest that one explanation for positive selection is that migrants are
influenced by skill-related differences in wage levels, rather than relative returns to skill,
which is consistent with cross-country differences in labor productivity being a dominant
factor in why labor moves across borders. In a world where wage level differences

4
matter, high-skill workers from low-wage countries may have a strong incentive to
migrate, even if returns to skill are high in the source country. We also estimate an
alternative version of the income maximization model in which relative returns, rather
than wage level differences, influence migrant selectivity.5 The data reject this model.
Our results on scale and selection are consistent with Rosenzweig (2007), who
examines legal migration to the U.S. and finds that source-country emigration rates are
decreasing in source-country labor productivity. This is comparable to our finding that
migration is increasing in the destination-source earnings difference by skill group.6
Relative to his work, we extend the analysis to multiple destinations, which enables us to
analyze sorting as well as scale and selectivity and to account for the relative contribution
of earnings and migration costs to international migration. We use our scale regression to
estimate the fixed costs of migration between 102 source countries and 15 destination
countries, finding that these costs are large, often an order of magnitude greater than
source-country earnings for low-skilled workers. We use our selection regression to
decompose emigrant selectivity into components attributable to wages differences and
components attributable to migration costs by source region and income level.
A second contribution of the paper is to establish the independence of migrant
selection and migrant sorting. While the selectivity of migration by skill depends on the
reward to skill in the source country, among other factors, the sorting of migrants by skill
does not. Positive sorting is a general implication of income maximization. We provide
the first evidence on the sorting of international migrants across destinations; previous
5

Other work on bilateral migration tends to use log per capita GDP to measure wages often with controls
for income inequality. See Volger and Rotte (2000), Pedersen, Pytlikova, and Smith (2004), Hatton and
Williamson (2005), Mayda (2005), and Clark, Hatton, and Williamson (2007).
6
In related work, Rosenzweig (2006) finds that the number of students who come to the U.S. for higher
education and who then stay in the U.S. are decreasing in labor productivity in the source country.

5
studies of sorting focused on internal US migration (Borjas, Bronars, and Trejo 1992;
Dahl 2002). We use our sorting regression to decompose differences in immigrant skills
across destination countries into components due to wage differences, language, distance,
and other factors. Skill-related wage differences are the dominant factor in explaining
why the U.S. and Canada receive more skilled immigrants than other OECD destinations.
In section 2, we present a simple model of international migration and derive the
estimating equations. In section 3, we describe our data. In section 4, we give the
estimation results. Section 5 offers concluding remarks.

2. Theory and Empirical Specification
A. A Model of Scale, Selection and Sorting in Migration
Consider migration flows between many source countries and many destination
countries. To be consistent with our data, assume that workers fall into one of three skill
groups, corresponding to primary, secondary, or tertiary education. Let the wage for
worker i with skill level j from source country s in destination country h be7
(1)

j
= exp(μ h + δ 2h D is2 + δ 3h D 3is ) ,
Wish

where exp(μh) is the wage paid to workers with primary education, δ2h is the return to
secondary education, δ3h is the return to tertiary education, and Disj is a dummy variable
indicating whether individual i from source s has schooling level j.
j
Let C ish
be the cost of migrating from s to h for worker i with skill level j, which

we assume to have two components: a fixed monetary cost common to all individuals
7

In (1), we do not allow for unobserved components of skill that may affect wages, which are of central
concern in Borjas (1987, 1991). Since our data on migrant stocks are aggregated by skill group and source
country, it is not possible to address within group heterogeneity in skill.

(which may be

positive or negative), such that

Migration costs are influenced by the linguistic and geographic distance between the
source and the destination and by destination-country immigration policies. The impacts
of these characteristics may depend on the migrant's skill due to time costs associated
with migration or skill-specific immigration policies in the destination.
Our primary interest is in a linear utility model where the utility associated with
migrating from country s to country h is a linear function of the difference between
j
wages and migration costs as well as an unobserved idiosyncratic term ε ish
such that

(3)

j
j
j
U ish
= α( Wihj − C ish
) + ε ish
,

where α > 0. We think of (3) as a first-order approximation to some general utility
function, with the marginal utility of income given by α. One of the “destinations” is the
source country itself, for which migration costs are zero.
Assuming that workers choose whether and where to emigrate so as to maximize
j
their utility, and assuming that ε ish
follows an i.i.d. extreme value distribution, we can

write the log odds of migrating to destination country h versus staying in the source
country s for members of skill group j as8

8

The specification of the disturbance in equation (3) embodies the assumption that IIA applies among
destination countries. In the empirical analysis, the sample of destination countries is limited to OECD
members. To use (4) as a basis for estimation, we need only that IIA applies to the OECD countries in the
sample. The analysis is thus consistent with more complicated nesting structures, in which we examine
only the OECD branch of the decision tree (one such structure would be in which individuals first choose
to migrate or not migrate, migrants then choose either OECD or non-OECD sets of destination countries,
and sub-migrants then choose among destinations within these sets). Alternatively, one might imagine that

7

where Esh
is the population share of education group j in s that migrates to h, Esj is the
j

population share of education group j in s that remains in s, and Whj = eμh +δh (McFadden
1974). Equation (4) speaks to the scale of migration. It says that income maximization,
together with our assumptions about utility and the error terms, implies that the skillgroup-specific log odds of migrating to h from s should depend positively on the level
difference in skill-specific wages between h and s and negatively on migration costs.
To analyze emigrant selection, take the difference of equation (4) between
tertiary- and primary-educated workers to yield:

The first term on the left side of (5) is a measure of the skill distribution of emigrants
from source s to destination h, which we refer to as the log skill ratio. The numerator is
the share of tertiary-schooled workers in s who migrate to h, and the denominator is the
share of primary-schooled workers in s who migrate to h. The second term on the left of
(5) is the log skill ratio for non-migrants in s, meaning the full expression on the left of
(5) is the difference in skill distributions between emigrants (from s to destination h) and
non-migrants for source country s.
If the left side of (5) is negative, emigrants are negatively selected; if it is positive,
they are positively selected. Since α > 0, equation (5) indicates that emigrants should be
positively selected if the wage difference between the source and destination countries,
there are multiple branches of the decision tree even among OECD destinations, such that IIA fails. In the
estimation, we test for this possibility, following the logic of Hausman and McFadden (1984).

net of skill-varying migration costs, is greater for high-skill workers. Emigrants should
be negatively selected if the net source-destination wage difference is greater for lowskill workers. Note that fixed costs fsh do not appear in the selection equation (5).
Differencing between skill groups has eliminated them from the expression.
To analyze the model’s implications for how emigrants should sort themselves
across destinations, collect those terms in (5) that vary only by source country to yield
(6)

E 3sh
E1sh

= α( Wh3 − Wh1 ) − α(g 3sh − g1sh ) + τ s

where τ s = ln(E 3s / E1s ) − α( Ws3 − Ws1 ) . Fixed costs do not appear in the sorting equation

(6) because they are absent from the selection equation (5).
Equation (6) expresses the key implication of utility maximization in the presence
of multiple destinations. Since α > 0, emigrants from a given source country should sort
themselves across destinations by skill according to the rewards to skill in different
destinations. If the (net) rewards to skill are higher in destination h than in destination k,
then destination h should receive a higher-skilled mix of emigrants from source country s
than should destination country k. Put differently, higher skill-related wage differences
should give destination countries an advantage in competing for skilled immigrants.

B. Relationship to Earlier Research

The model summarized in (4), (5), and (6) highlights the role of fixed costs and
level wage differences in influencing the scale, selectivity, and sorting of migration

flows. In contrast, much of the literature focuses on relative returns to skill and assumes

9
migration costs are proportional to income (see Borjas, 1991 and 1999). It is useful to
compare these two models theoretically and empirically.
To do so, consider a log utility model where wages and migration costs are as
before, but utility is given by

scale of migration is influenced by the relative wage difference between the source and
destination countries (see (8)), and selectivity and sorting are functions of returns to skill,
as given by the δ terms, rather than skill-related level wage differences (see (9) and (10)).
In the log utility model, differencing between skill groups does not in general
eliminate either fixed or skill-varying migration costs from the selection or sorting
equations in (9) and (10). In the special case where skill-varying costs are proportional to
j
= πsh Whj , differencing between skill groups eliminates skill-varying
wages, such that g sh

costs, but not fixed costs. Since much of the literature has focused on models where
skill-varying costs are assumed to be proportional to wages and fixed costs are assumed
to be zero, it represents a case of special interest.
Examining conditions for migrant selectivity provides a useful way of comparing
our linear utility model with fixed migration costs to the more standard log utility model
with proportional migration costs. To analyze our linear utility model, substitute the
definition of Whj into the right side of (5), rearrange terms, and make use of the fact that
e δ − 1 ≈ δ . Our linear utility model then predicts that emigrants should be negatively
selected in terms of skill if

3
In the special case where g sh
= 0 , as would occur if fixed migration costs were

independent of skill, the condition for negative selection reduces to δs3 δ 3h > Wh1 Ws1 .
Now consider the log utility model where fixed costs are zero and skill-varying costs are
proportional to wages. Under these conditions, equation (9) shows that negative selection
will obtain if δs3 / δ3h > 1 , as in Borjas (1987).
The two models make similar predictions about migrant selectivity in the context
of typical north-to-north migration, where similar productivity levels between the source
and the destination imply that low-skill wages are also similar, such that Wh1 ≈ Ws1 . In
that case, both models predict that emigrants who move from a source with high returns
to skill to a destination with low returns should be negatively selected. However, the
models make different predictions in the context of much south-to-north migration, where

11
differences in productivity imply that Wh1 >> Ws1 . Here, our linear utility model predicts
negative selection only when the relative return to skill in the source country ( δs3 / δ 3h )
exceeds the relative productivity advantage of the destination country ( Wh1 / Ws1 ).10
The evidence suggests that returns to schooling tend to be higher in developing
countries than in the U.S. or Europe (Psacharopoulos and Patrinos, 2004; Hanushek and
Zhang, 2006), so the log utility/proportional cost model implies that emigrants from
developing countries should tend to be negatively selected. This prediction is clearly at
odds with Figure 1. However, the linear utility model could be consistent with Figure 1,
so along as productivity differences across countries dominate differences in the returns
to schooling (or skill-specific migration costs are higher for low-skill workers).
While many studies have tested for the selectivity of migrants, fewer analysts
have examined migrant sorting across multiple destinations. Borjas, Bronars, and Trejo
(1992) develop a theoretical model that predicts sorting on the basis of destination returns
to skill. They and Dahl (2002) estimate empirical models of sorting using data on
internal migration in the U.S. There have been no studies of migrant sorting in the
context of international labor flows.
One point that seems to have escaped the theoretical literature is that selection and
sorting are logically independent. In terms of our model, sorting between destinations h
and k depends on the sign of
Δ hk = [Wh3 − Wh1 − (g3sh − g1sh )] − [Wk3 − Wk1 − (g3sk − g1sk )] ,

10

Factoring in skill-specific migration costs makes predictions about selection even more ambiguous in the
linear utility/fixed cost model. Recall that skill specific costs in (11), g3sh, may be positive or negative. If
more skilled workers tend to have higher (lower) costs, the likelihood of negative selection would be higher
(lower) than the base case of no skill-specific costs.

12
whereas from (5), selection to destination h depends on the sign of
3
Δ h = (Wh3 − Ws3 − gsh
) − (Wh1 − Ws1 − g1sh ) .

Since selection depends on source-country wages, whereas sorting does not, sorting is
independent of selection. If Δhk > 0 , then destination h should receive more highly
skilled migrants than destination k. This should hold whether emigrants from s to both h
and k are positively selected ( Δh > 0, Δk > 0 ), negatively selected ( Δh < 0, Δk < 0 ), or
even bimodally selected ( Δh < 0 and Δk > 0 or vice-versa).

C. Estimation

Although the discussion until now has been cast in terms of population
magnitudes, it is straightforward to derive an estimating equation which can be used to
test for income maximization. Let xsh be a vector of characteristics of the sourcedestination pair, such as geographic and linguistic distance, and let skill-varying costs be

= x sh θ j .11 The empirical version of the scale equation is
given by g sh

The key hypothesis to be tested in each regression is that α > 0, as utility
maximization requires. Indeed, if the models are properly specified, all three equations
should yield similar estimates of α. However, an important difference among these
specifications is the treatment of fixed costs. To estimate the scale equation (12) we must
assume fixed costs are a function of observable characteristics. If that assumption fails,
the scale equation may be misspecified. In contrast, fixed costs are differenced out of the
selection and scale equations, so they should provide a more robust basis for inference.
The scale and selection equations require data on both source and destination
wages. This limits the sample, since reliable wage data are not available for all potential
source countries. The sorting equation requires only destination-country wage data,
increasing the number of source countries that can be used to estimate the model.
Additionally, measurement error may be lower in the destination countries, comprised of
OECD members, than in source countries, which include the developing world.
Finally, we estimate the log-utility model so as to provide a direct comparison
with the linear-utility model. In the important special case where fixed costs are zero and

skill-varying costs are proportional to wages, such that λmsh

should yield similar estimates of λ.

3. Data and Empirical Setting

In the introduction we presented data on skill-specific migration rates which
showed evidence of positive selection. They also showed evidence of sorting across
multiple destinations of the type predicted by income maximization. Those data are from
Docquier and Marfouk (2006). We base our regression analysis on an updated version of
these data from Beine, Docquier, and Rapoport (2007; hereafter, BDR).
BDR tabulate data on stocks of emigrants by source and destination country. In
collaboration with the national statistical offices of 20 OECD countries, they estimate the
population in each OECD country of immigrants 25 years and older by source country
and education level. In some of the OECD destinations, these counts are based on census
data, whereas in others they are based on register data. BDR classify schooling levels
into three categories: primary (0-8 years), secondary (9-12 years), and tertiary (13 plus
years). Because education systems differ so much among countries, it is nearly
impossible to categorize schooling in a comparable manner at a finer level of detail.

15

A. Measurement of Emigrant Stocks

Aggregating data from multiple destination countries raises several comparability
issues. The first involves the definition of immigrants. Some countries, such as
Germany, define immigrants on the basis of country of citizenship rather than country of
birth. This causes some of the foreign born to be excluded from BDR’s immigrant counts
in these countries. We check the robustness of our regression results by dropping such
countries from some of the specifications.
Measuring education levels poses several problems. In Belgium and Italy, the
statistical office reports aggregate immigrant counts but does not disaggregate by
education level. BDR impute the skill distribution of immigrants in such cases using data
from household labor-force surveys, but in light of the role that education plays in our
analysis, we drop Belgium and Italy from the sample of destinations.
National statistical offices differ in how they classify educational attainment.
Some countries' classification systems have no attainment category that distinguishes
whether a person who lacks a secondary-school qualification (such as a high school
diploma) acquired any secondary education, or whether their schooling stopped at the
primary level (grade 8 or below). This could result in inconsistencies in the share of
primary-educated immigrants across destination countries. In our regressions we control
for whether the destination country explicitly codes primary education.
Some immigrants may have acquired their tertiary schooling in the destination
country. By implication, they might have obtained less schooling had they not migrated.
BDR provide some evidence on this point in the form of immigrant counts (for those with
tertiary education) that vary by the age at which migrants arrived in the destination

16
country (any age, 12 years or older, 18 years or older, 22 years or older). They find that
68% of tertiary migrants arrive in the destination country at age 22 or older, and 10%
arrive between ages 18 and 21, suggesting the large majority of tertiary emigrants depart
sending countries at an age at which they would typically have acquired at least some
post-secondary education. Reassuringly, the correlations in emigration rates by age at
migration range from 0.97 to 0.99. In section 4.2 we provide additional checks on the
importance of tertiary schooling acquired in the destination country.
Finally, although our theoretical framework treats migration as a permanent
decision, many migrants do not remain abroad forever. There is considerable back-andforth migration between neighboring countries (Durand, Massey, and Zenteno, 2001),
which we address by controlling for source-destination proximity. Furthermore, some
migrants are students who will return to their home countries after completing their
education. These migrants may have been motivated by educational opportunities in
destination countries, as well as wage differences (Rosenzweig, 2006). BDR partially
address this issue by restricting the foreign born to be 25 years and older, a population
that should have largely completed its schooling. In 2000 in the United States, the share
of foreign-born individuals 25-64 years old with tertiary education who stated they were
not in school was 86.4%. In section 4.2 we attempt to control for differences in
educational opportunities between source and destination countries.
Tables 1 and 2 describe broad patterns of migration into OECD countries. As
noted in section 1, Table 1 shows that North America receives disproportionately highskilled migrants, whereas Europe's' immigrants are disproportionately low-skilled. Table
2 shows the share of OECD immigrants by country of origin for the 15 largest source

17
countries. Source countries tend to send emigrants to nearby destinations, as is evident in
Turkish migration to Europe, Korean migration to Australia and Oceania, and Mexican
and Cuban migration to the United States. Yet, most of the source countries in Table 2
send migrants to all three destination regions. Finally, Figure 2 plots the log odds of
emigration for the tertiary educated against the log odds of emigration for the primary
educated. Nearly all points lie above the 45-degree line, indicating that the log odds of
emigration is higher for the more educated, as is consistent with emigrants being
positively selected in terms of schooling.

B. Wage Measures

The key explanatory variables in our regression models are functions of skillgroup-specific wages in the source and destination countries. Ideally, we would estimate
wages by broad education category from the same sources used by DM. Since such data
are not available to us, we turn to different sources.
Our first source is the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS, various years), which
collects microdata from the household surveys of 30 primarily developed countries
worldwide. This includes most of the destination countries in the BDR data, with the
exceptions of Finland, Greece, New Zealand, and Portugal. The intersection of the 13
countries for which BDR and LIS provide useful data (Australia, Austria, Canada,
Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the UK,
the US) were host to 91 percent of immigrants in the OECD in 2000.12 We use data from
waves 4 and 5 of the LIS, which span the years 1994-2000.

12

We exclude Switzerland from the destinations because the LIS provides no data on the country after
1992. In 2000, Switzerland had 2.5 percent of the foreign-born population residing in OECD countries.

18
Although the LIS attempts to “harmonize” the data from different countries, a
number of comparability issues arise. One limitation is that the LIS’s constituent
household surveys sometimes classify educational attainment differently than the national
statistical office of the corresponding country. This adds the problem of within-country
comparability to the already difficult problem of between-country comparability.
Ultimately, it proved impossible for us to map education categories between the BDR and
the LIS data in a manner in which we had full confidence.
Therefore, instead of using education-specific earnings to measure skill-related
wages, we use quantiles of each country’s earnings distribution. We use the 20th
percentile as our measure of low-skill wages and the 80th percentile as our measure of
high-skill wages.13 We average across 1994 to 2000 for each country in the LIS.14,
Although the cross-country comparability of the LIS is a desirable feature, we can
only use the LIS to estimate our sorting regressions. The reason is that it provides wage
data only for our destination countries, whereas the scale and sorting regressions require
comparable wage data for the source countries as well. To the best of our knowledge,
there is no study that provides micro-level data for a large sample of source countries.15
We rely on two sources of aggregate data to construct the source-destination wage
difference measures needed to estimate the scale and sorting regressions.

13

In a previous version of this paper (Grogger and Hanson, 2007), we experimented with alternative
measures of wage differences based on various measures of low-skill wages and different measures of the
return to skill (the standard deviation of income, the ratio of income in the 80th to 20th percentiles, and the
Gini coefficient). All alternatives we considered generated results similar to those we report in this paper.
14
The years corresponding to each country are as follows: Australia (1995, 2001), Austria (1994, 1995,
1997, 2000), Canada (1994, 1997, 1998, 2000), Denmark (1995, 2000), France (1994, 2000), Germany
(1004, 2000), the Netherlands (1994, 1999), Norway (1995, 2000), Spain (1995, 2000), Sweden (1995,
2000), the UK (1994, 1995, 2000), and the US (1994, 1997, 2000).
15
The IPUMS-International study provides samples of Census data for 26 countries, but many important
sources and destinations for migrants are not included.

19
One source combines Gini coefficients from the WIDER World Income
Inequality Database with per capita GDP from the World Development Indicators
(hereafter, WDI). Under the assumption that income has a log normal distribution, Gini
coefficients can be used to estimate the variance of log income.16 Using per capita GDP
to measure mean wages, we can then construct estimates of the 20th and 80th percentiles
of wages (see note 17), which we are able to do for 102 source countries and 15
destination countries.17
A second source uses data from Freeman and Oostendorp (2000; hereafter FO),
who have collected information on earnings by occupation and industry from the
International Labor Organization’s October Inquiry Survey. FO standardize the ILO data
to correct for differences in how countries report earnings. The resulting data contain
observations on earnings in up to 163 occupation-industries per country in each year,
from which FO construct deciles for earnings by country and year. For each country, we
take as low-skill wages earnings corresponding to the 10th percentile and as high-skill
wages earnings corresponding to the 80th percentile. We choose these deciles because
they give the highest correlations with 80th and 20th percentile wages in the LIS. Since
not all countries report data in all years, for each country we take the mean across the
period 1988 to 1997, creating a sample with 101 source countries and 12 destinations.

16

Suppose log income is normally distributed with mean μ and variance σ. Given an estimate of the Gini
⎛ G +1 ⎞
coefficient, G, the standard deviation of log income is given by σ = 2Φ −1 ⎜
⎟ . Note further that the
⎝ 2 ⎠
value of log income at the α quantile is given by μ exp(σz α − σ2 / 2) , where z α is the α quantile of N(0,1).
17
We restricted attention to Gini coefficients computed from income data over the period 1990-2000,
where the underlying sample was drawn from the country’s full population. For each country, we averaged
over all Gini coefficients that satisfied those criteria. GDP per capita is averaged over the period 1990 to
2000 and expressed in constant 2000 dollars.

20
Table 3 presents summary statistics of these wage measures. The top two panels
provide data for the destination countries. The top panel shows that the LIS produces
higher wages and larger skill-related wage differences than the other sources. Despite the
differences in scale, the correlation between skill-related wage differences in the LIS and
the WDI data is 0.86; between the LIS and the FO data it is 0.78.
The second panel reports summary statistics for after-tax measures of destinationcountry wages. We consider such measures since pre-tax wage differences overstate the
return to skill enjoyed by workers and since tax policy varies within the OECD (Alesina
and Angeletos 2002). To construct post-tax wage differences we employ average tax
rates by income level published by the OECD since 1996 (OECD, various years). To
20th percentile earnings we apply the tax rate applicable to single workers with no
dependents whose earnings equal 67 percent of the average production worker’s earnings.
To 80th percentile earnings we apply the tax rate applicable to a comparable worker with
earnings equal to 167 percent of the average production worker’s earnings.18 In both
cases, the tax rate includes income taxes net of benefits plus both sides of the payroll tax.
After-tax wage differences are only about half as large as pre-tax differences.
The third panel provides data for the source countries. Only WDI and FO data are
shown, since the LIS provides no source-country data. Source country wages vary less
than destination-country wages between the two sources; the correlation between skillrelated wage differences is 0.91. Unfortunately, we have no tax data for most of our
source countries. Thus the scale and selection regressions below are estimated only from
pre-tax wage data, whereas we report sorting regressions for pre- and post-tax wages.
18

Prior to averaging income across years, we match to each year and income group that year’s
corresponding tax rate. Since the tax data only go back to 1996, we use tax rates for that year to calculate
post-tax income values in 1994 and 1995.

21

D. Other Variables in the Regression Model

Differences in language between source and destination countries may be
relatively more important for more-educated workers, since communication and
information processing are likely to be salient aspects of their occupations. We control
for whether the source and destination country share a common official language based
on data from CEPII (http://www.cepii.fr/). Similarly, English-speaking countries may
attract skilled emigrants because English is widely taught in school as a second
language.19 To avoid confounding destination-country skilled-unskilled wage differences
with the attraction of being in an English-speaking country, we control for whether a
destination country has English as its primary language.
Migration costs are likely to be increasing in distance between a source and
destination country. Relatedly, proximity may make illegal immigration less costly,
thereby increasing the relative migration of less-educated individuals. We include as
regressors great circle distance, the absolute difference in longitude, and an indicator for
source-destination contiguity. Migration networks may lower migration costs (Munshi,
2003), benefiting lower-income individuals disproportionately (Orrenius and Zavodny,
2005; McKenzie and Rapoport, 2006). Networks may be stronger between countries that
share a common colonial heritage, for which we control using CEPII’s indicators of
whether a pair of countries have short or long colonial histories. We also control for

19

English-speaking countries may also attract the more skilled because they have common-law traditions
that provide relatively strong protection of property rights (Glaeser and Schleifer, 2002).

22
migrant networks using lagged migration, measured as the total stock of emigrants from a
source country in a destination as of 1990.20
Destination countries impose a variety of conditions in deciding which
immigrants to admit, many of which involve the education level of immigrants. One
indicator of the skill bias in a country’s admission policies is the fraction of visas it
reserves for refugees and asylees. Less-educated individuals may be more likely to end
up as refugees, making countries that favor refugees in their admissions likely to receive
more less-educated immigrants. We control for the share of immigrant inflows
composed of refugees and asylees averaged over the 1992-1999 period (OECD, 2005).21
The European signatories of the Schengen Agreement have committed to abolish all
border barriers, including temporary migration restrictions, on participating countries.
We control for whether a source-destination pair were both signatories of Schengen as of
1999. Similarly, some countries do not require visas for visitors from particular countries
of origin, with the set of visa-waiver countries varying across destination countries.
While visa waivers strictly affect only tourist and business travelers, they may indicate a
source-country bias that also applies to other immigrant admissions. We control for
whether a destination country grants a visa waiver to individuals from a source country as
of 1999. Clearly, other aspects of policy may influence migration as well.
Unfortunately, the existing data do not permit one to characterize immigration policy
very thoroughly in a manner that is comparable across destinations. As important as

20

Because we are missing lagged migration for many observations in the sample, we add the variable only
in later specifications. All results are robust to its inclusion.
21
Countries also differ in the share of visas that they reserve for skilled labor. Unfortunately, we could
only obtain this measure for a subset of destination countries. Over time, the share of visas awarded to
asylees/refugees and the share awarded to skill workers are strongly negative correlated (OECD, 2005),
suggesting policies on asylees/refugees may be a sufficient statistic for a country’s immigration priorities.

23
immigration policy may be, existing data simply do not permit a more detailed
characterization of the policy environment.
Finally, note that the regressors used in the analysis vary either by destination or
source-destination pair. One might imagine that source-country-specific characteristics
could also affect international migration. Some, such as the state of the credit market or
the poverty rate, are observable and could be controlled for explicitly. Others, however,
are unobservable. Rather than controlling for a limited set of observable source-country
characteristics explicitly, we provide implicit controls for both observable and
unobservable source-country characteristics via the source-country fixed effects in the
sorting regression.22

4. Regression Analysis
A. Main results

Our main regression analyses are based on the scale, selection, and sorting
regressions derived from the linear-utility model, equations (12), (13), and (14),
respectively. Our main results are based on wage measures constructed from the WDI
and LIS data. Estimates are reported in Table 4.
In the scale equation reported in column (1), the unit of observation is the sourcedestination-skill group cell, with one observation for the primary educated (j=1) and one
observation for the tertiary educated (j=3) for each source-destination pair. The

22

In unreported results, we experimented with two source-specific variables. Private credit to the private
sector as a share of GDP is a measure of the financial development of the source country (Aghion et al.
2006), which may affect constraints on financing migration. The variable was statistically insignificant in
all specifications and its inclusion did not affect other results. The incidence of poverty in the source
country may also affect credit constraints. While data on poverty headcounts are not available for all the
countries in our sample, the share of agriculture in GDP tends to be highly correlated with poverty
measures. The inclusion of the agriculture share of GDP also leaves our core results unchanged.

24
dependent variable is the log odds of emigrating from source s to destination h for
members of skill group j, and the wage measure is the skill-specific difference in pre-tax
wages between the destination and source countries, Whj − Wsj . In the selection equation
reported in column (2), the unit of observation is the source-destination pair.23 The
dependent variable is the difference between the log skill ratio of emigrants from s to h
and the log skill ratio of non-migrants in source s.24 The wage measure is the difference
between the destination and the source in skill-related pre-tax wage differences,
( Wh3 − Wh1 ) − ( Ws3 − Ws1 ) . In the sorting equations reported in columns (3) through (6),
the unit of observation is again the source-destination pair, but the dependent variable is
the log skill ratio of emigrants from s to h. The key independent variable is the skillrelated wage difference of the destination country, ( Wh3 − Wh1 ) . Like the scale and
selection regressions, the sorting regressions in columns (3) and (4) are based on the WDI
data; column (3) is based on pre-tax data, whereas column (4) is based on post-tax data.
Columns (5) and (6) are based on pre- and post-tax data from the LIS.
Because the dependent variables have a log-odds metric, the magnitude of the
regression coefficients does not have a particularly useful interpretation.25 As a result,
we focus in this section on the signs and significance levels of the coefficients. We
discuss applications below that provide information about the quantitative effects of key
variables on migration scale, selectivity, and sorting.

23

In the WDI data, there are 15 destinations and 102 source countries. Since source countries do not send
emigrants to every destination country, the number of observations is less than 15 x 102 = 1530.
24
Equivalently, the dependent variable can be seen as the difference in the log odds of migrating from
source s to destination h between the tertiary educated and the primary educated.
25
Based on equation (4), one might think that the coefficient on the earnings difference would identify the
marginal utility of income. However, this would only be true if the variance on the idiosyncratic
component of utility in (3) is unity.

25
In addition to the variables shown, all of the regressions include a dummy
variable equal to one if the destination-country statistical office explicitly codes a primary
education category. This controls for systematic differences in our dependent variable
that arise from different coding schemes, as discussed in section 3. The scale regression
includes a dummy variable equal to one for observations corresponding to the tertiaryeducated skill group, denoted I(j=3), and interactions between that dummy and all other
regressors (these coefficients are not shown in order to save space). The sorting
regressions include a full set of source-country dummies. Standard errors, reported in
parentheses, are clustered by destination country.
The wage coefficients in columns (1) through (3) are directly comparable because
they are all based on pre-tax data from WDI. In the context of our model, they each
provide estimates of the same parameter α, where income maximization implies α > 0.
Furthermore, if the regression models are properly specified, the coefficients from scale,
selection, and sorting regressions should be similar.
In Table 4, all three wage coefficients are positive, as predicted by the theory.
Furthermore, the coefficients from the selection and sorting regressions are quite similar
and are both statistically significant. However, the coefficient in the scale equation is
smaller and insignificant. This may indicate that omitted fixed costs result in a
misspecified scale equation. In the scale equation, we assume that fixed costs are a
function of observable characteristics of the source-destination pair. In the selection and
sorting regressions, in contrast, fixed costs are differenced out. The difference in the
wage coefficients between the scale and selection regressions suggests that the scale

26
equation omits fixed costs that are negatively correlated with the difference in skillspecific wage differences between destination and source countries.
The wage coefficient in column (4) suggests that migrants sort more strongly on
post-tax wages than pre-tax wages, as one might expect. The estimates in columns (5)
and (6), based on wage data from the LIS, show a similar pattern. Both coefficients are
positive and significant, and the coefficient on post-tax wages in column (6) is larger than
the coefficient on pre-tax wages in column (5). Among the destination countries in the
sample, the U.S and Canada have relatively large pre-tax skill-related wage differences.
Since these countries also have less progressive tax systems, their relative attractiveness
to skilled migrants is enhanced by accounting for taxes.26
The regressions also include variables reflecting geographic, linguistic, social, and
political relationships between source and destination countries. They show that
language plays an important role in international migration. The positive coefficient on
the Anglophone-destination dummy in column (1) shows that English-speaking countries
receive more immigrants than other countries, all else equal. The coefficient in the
selection regression (column (2)) shows that emigrants bound for English-speaking
destinations are more highly educated in relation to their non-migrant countrymen than
emigrants bound elsewhere. Finally, the coefficients in the sorting regressions (columns
(3) through (6)) show that English-speaking destinations attract higher-skilled immigrants
than other destinations, on average.
The next variable is also language-related, indicating whether the source and
destination countries have an official language in common. Its coefficients are positive

26

In the LIS data, the U.S., the U.K, and Canada are first, fourth and fifth among destinations in terms of
pre-tax wage differences and first, second, and third in terms of post-tax wage differences.

27
and significant, like the Anglophone-destination coefficients. Emigration is greater
toward destinations that share a language with the source, and such emigrants are more
skilled than either their non-migrant counterparts or emigrants from the same source
bound to other destinations. This suggests that migrants perceive higher rewards to skill
in destinations where they can speak a language they know.
The next three variables capture differences in geography between the source and
destination countries. Contiguity raises the scale of migration. However, it reduces the
skills of emigrants, all else equal, in relation both to non-migrants (as seen in the
selection regression) and to migrants to non-contiguous destinations (as seen in the
sorting regression), perhaps reflecting the relative ease of illegal migration between
neighboring countries. In the scale equation, the longitude-difference coefficient is
insignificant, but the log-distance coefficient is negative and significant. One
interpretation is that migration is lower, the greater the distance between the source and
the destination, but controlling for distance, the need to cross an ocean (which follows
from long longitudinal distances) has no independent effect. The same two coefficients
have different signs in the selection and sorting regressions. Emigrants to more distant
destinations are more skilled than non-migrants, all else equal, but less skilled than
emigrants to other destinations. The opposite is true of transoceanic emigrants.
History affects migration, too. Both short- and long-term colonial relationships
increase the scale of migration, all else equal. At the same time, emigrants to the former
colonial power are less skilled than non-migrants and less skilled than emigrants to other
destinations. Recent literature suggests that economic and social networks between
industrialized countries and their former colonies contribute to bilateral migration flows,

28
much in the way such networks also appear to contribute to bilateral trade (Pedersen,
Pytlikova, and Smith 2004, Mayda 2005). Our empirical results are consistent with
these linkages disproportionately affecting migration of the less-skilled.
There is also an important role for our limited measures of immigration policy.
The effect of asylum policy on the scale of immigration is insignificant, but generous
asylum policies reduce immigrant skills with relation to both non-migrants and migrants
to other destinations. This finding suggests destinations that allocate a higher share of
visas to asylees and refugees may limit opportunities for more-skilled migrants to gain
entry, producing a less skilled migrant inflow.27 Visa waivers are associated with higher
migration rates, although the effect is marginally significant. Visa waivers significantly
reduce the skills of emigrants in relation to non-migrants, but increase skill in relation to
emigrants who move to a destination with which the source country has no visa waiver.
The Schengen accord has had little effect on the scale of migration among signatory
countries, but it is associated with positive selection and positive sorting of migrants.

B. Results for Log Utility Model

Table 5 reports results based on the scale, selection, and sorting regressions
derived from the log-utility model in equations (15), (16), and (17). The layout of Table
5 is similar to Table 4. The dependent variables in Table 5 are the same as those in the
corresponding columns of Table 4 and the units of observation are the same as well.
The wage measures differ between the linear and log-utility models. In the scale
equation of the log-utility model, reported in column (1), the wage measure is the skillspecific difference in pre-tax log wages between the destination and source countries,
27

On asylee and refugee policy in Europe, see Hatton and Williamson (2004).

29
ln Whj − ln Wsj . In the selection equation reported in column (2), the measure is the

difference between the destination and the source in the return to skill, ( δ3h − δ1s ) , where
the return to skill in a country is the log ratio of high-skill to low-skill wages. In the
sorting equations reported in columns (3) through (6), the wage variable is the return to
skill in the destination country, δ 3h . As in Table 4, columns (1) through (4) are based on
the WDI data, whereas columns (5) and (6) are based on LIS data . Returns to skill are
based on pre-tax data in columns (1), (2), (3), and (5) and on post-tax data in columns (4)
and (6). To focus on a case of special importance in the literature, we impose the
assumptions that fixed migration costs are zero and skill-varying costs are proportionate
to wages. This implies that in the scale regression, the regressors control for proportional
migration costs (see equation (15) and the surrounding discussion). It also means that the
only regressor in the selection regression is ( δ3h − δ1s ) , since proportional costs are
differenced out. Likewise it implies that the only regressors in the sorting regressions are
δ 3h and the source-country dummies.

As in the linear-utility model, utility maximization implies that all of the
coefficients on log wages and returns to skill should be positive. Furthermore, if the
model is properly specified, the coefficients in columns (1) through (3) should be similar.
In fact, the wage coefficients in the scale and selection regressions are negative and
significant, whereas the sorting coefficients are both positive and significant.

30
The assumptions that fixed costs are zero and skill-varying costs are proportional
to wages result in rather sparsely parameterized regressions.28 When we relax these
restrictions by assuming both fixed and skill-varying costs to be functions of observed
country-pair characteristics, the wage coefficients in the scale and selection regressions
remain negative and significant and the wage coefficients in the sorting regressions
remain positive and significant.29 Thus, the sign pattern of the coefficients in Table 5
holds whether or not other regressors are included in the estimation.
We see two potential explanations for the difference between the linear-utility and
log-utility regressions. One concerns omitted variable bias due to weak controls for fixed
costs. Differencing the scale equation between skill groups eliminates fixed costs from
the selection and sorting regressions in the case of linear utility, but not in the case of log
utility. Fixed costs that were strongly negatively correlated with source-destination
differences in log wages and returns to skill could explain the negative coefficients in the
scale and selection regressions in Table 5.
Perhaps more important is the lack of negative selectivity in the data, as seen in
Figure 1. Log-utility maximization requires that λ be positive. It also requires that for
source-destination pairs where δ3h − δs3 < 0, migrants be negatively selected. In the data,
we observe numerous cases where δ3h − δs3 < 0, but no negative selection. Inspection of
28

Belot and Hatton (2008) find that the correlation between skilled migration rates and the skill-specific
difference in log wages between source and destination countries is sensitive to whether controls for
poverty rates in the source are included in the estimation. In unreported results, we find that the negative
coefficient on the returns to skill we estimate in the log utility selection regression obtains whether or not
controls for poverty rates are included in the estimation (see note 22).
29
In the log utility model, if we assume that fixed migration costs are a function of the same variables as in
Table 4, allowing for fixed costs means including these variables as regressors, divided by the destination
country wage, as shown in the derivations of equations (8)-(10). Alternatively, one might imagine
including these regressors uninteracted with the destination wage. Under either specification – including
the same regressors as in Table 4 either on their own or divided by the destination wage – the log wage
variable enters with a negative sign in the scale and selection regressions.

31
equation (9) shows that such negative correlation between δ3h − δs3 and
3
ln( E sh
/ E1sh ) − ln( E s3 / E1s ) will tend to result in a negative estimate of λ, contrary to the

requirements of the theory. In other words, the lack of negative selection in the data is at
odds with the joint assumptions that migrants maximize the log utility of net wages and
that migration costs are proportional to wages.
A remaining question is why the wage coefficients in the log-utility sorting
regressions are positive, like their counterparts in the linear-utility sorting regressions.
Put differently, why do the sorting regressions fail to distinguish between linear and log
utility, when the selection regressions draw the distinction so clearly? The reason is that
the wage measure only varies among the 15 destination countries, and among countries
with relatively similar levels of labor productivity, sorting on log differences in wages
(i.e., returns to skill) looks similar to sorting on level differences in wages. Indeed, the
rank correlation between the log wage difference and the level wage difference across
destination countries is 0.68. In order to distinguish between linear and log utility on the
basis of the sorting regressions, one would need a sample that included destinations with
widely differing levels of productivity.30

C. Robustness Checks

Tables 6 through 8 report results from a number of specifications designed to
check the robustness of our results. We restrict attention to the linear utility model in
light of its superior performance relative to the log utility model. We further restrict
attention to the selection and sorting regressions, since they are more robust in the
30

The similarity of productivity levels among U.S. states may explain why log-utility models have yielded
evidence in favor of sorting among U.S. domestic migrants (Borjas, Bronars, and Trejo 1994; Dahl 2002).

32
presence of fixed migration costs. For the sorting regressions, we focus on specifications
that include the post-tax wage differences. All of the estimates reported in these tables
are taken from regressions that include all the variables reported in our baseline
specifications, shown in columns (2), (4) and (6) of Table 4. Here we present only the
wage coefficients in order to conserve space.
Table 6 presents estimates based on alternative wage measures. The top panel
reports results based on WDI wages in which source wages are adjusted by sourcecountry PPP and destination wages are adjusted by destination PPP, to account for
differences in the cost of living across countries. Adjusting for PPP makes the coefficient
in the selection regression slightly larger and the coefficient in the sorting regression
slightly smaller and insignificant. In the second panel, we see that adjusting for PPP
using LIS wages yields wage coefficients that are positive and significant, as in Table 4.31
The bottom two panels of Table 6 present results based on the FreemanOostendorp wage data described in Section 3. Without adjusting for PPP, the wage
coefficients in both the selection and sorting regressions are positive. The selection
coefficient is significant, whereas the sorting coefficient has a t-statistic of 1.6. Adjusting
the Freeman-Oostendorp wages for PPP reduces the selection coefficient and raises both
the sorting coefficient and its significance. We conclude that the key results from the
linear utility model are fairly robust to alternative wage measures.32

31

The sample size is smaller here than for other LIS-based regressions because of missing PPP data for a
few source countries.
32
It would seem natural to treat the FO data as an instrument for the WDI data to deal with measurement
error. To be a valid instrument, the measurement errors associated with the two different data sources
would have to be uncorrelated with each other and with the true wage measures. Preliminary analysis
showed that the covariance between the two measures exceeded the variance of the FO wage measure,
which implies that the measurement errors are correlated with each other, with true wages, or both.

33
In Table 7 we return to our original unadjusted, WDI and LIS-based wage
measures and report results obtained from alternative specifications. Columns (1)
through (3) address the problem that some emigrants may have obtained their tertiary
education in the destination country rather than the source country. If the cost of
acquiring tertiary education across destination countries were negatively correlated with
destination-country wage differences, then the effect on immigrant skill that we attribute
to wage differences could instead be due to differences in educational costs. To deal with
this issue we redefine the numerator of the skill ratios in the dependent variables to be the
sum of tertiary- and secondary-educated immigrants. This addresses the problem if we
can assume all tertiary-educated immigrants would have obtained at least a secondary
education in their source country. The coefficients in columns (1) through (3), where the
dependent variables are based on this alternative definition of the log skill ratio, are all
positive and significant and differ little from estimates in our baseline specifications.
Columns (4) through (9) report the results of adding to our baseline specifications
two variables designed to capture other potential costs or benefits of migration that vary
by skill. Columns (4)-(6) add a relative university quality measure based on the worldwide ranking of universities by Shanghai Jiao Tong University (http://ed.sjtu.edu.cn). It
is equal to the average rank of universities within the destination country (among top 250
universities worldwide), interacted with a dummy variable equal to one if the source
country has no ranked universities.33 We intend this as a proxy for the education-related
benefit of migrating relative to remaining in the home country. Relative university
quality has no effect on emigrant selectivity, as seen in column (4). The coefficients in

33

Observations in which Ireland is the destination are dropped from these regressions because Ireland has
no universities in the top 250.

34
the sorting regressions (columns (5) and (6)) are negative, as one might expect (higherranked institutions have ranks closer to one), and significant. Higher ranked universities
appear to act as a draw for higher-skilled immigrants from countries with low-quality
education systems, consistent with Rosenzweig (2006). The wage coefficients in all three
regressions are similar to those from our baseline specifications.
Columns (7) through (9) add the log total stock of emigrants from the source in
the destination as of 1990. We are missing this variable for about 30% of our sample,
which causes the number of observations to drop considerably. Nevertheless, the wage
variables have similar magnitudes and patterns of significance as in Table 4. In the
selection regression, the lagged migrant stock enters with a negative sign and is precisely
estimated. Larger past bilateral migration is associated with less-educated current
migration, consistent with migrant networks lowering migration costs disproportionately
for less-skilled individuals. Orrenius and Zavodny (2005) and McKenzie and Rapoport
(2006) obtain similar findings for Mexican migration to the U.S. In the sorting
regressions, lagged migration also enters negatively, indicating that the pull of an existing
migrant stock in a destination is stronger for less-skilled migrants, but the coefficient is
precisely estimated only in one of the two regressions.
In columns (10) and (11), we present sorting regressions based on data from all
the available source countries, irrespective of whether we have wage data for them. This
highlights the advantage of the sorting regression, for which only destination-country
wage data is necessary. Estimates based on the larger sample are similar to those from
the smaller sample that includes only source countries with available wage data.

35
Table 8 addresses the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) assumption
implicit in the conditional logit framework. IIA arises from the assumption that the error
terms in equation (3) are i.i.d. across alternative destinations. IIA may be violated if two
or more of our destinations are perceived as close substitutes by potential migrants.
Hausman and McFadden (1984) note that if IIA is satisfied, then the estimated regression
coefficients should be stable across choice sets. In the context of our application, this
means that the regression coefficients should be similar when we drop destinations from
the sample. To check for violations of IIA, we re-estimated our models 15 times, each
time dropping one of the 15 destinations. The resulting coefficients on the key wage
variables are reported in Table 8. In general, they are quite similar across samples,
suggesting that the IIA property is not violated in our data.34

D. Fixed Costs, Emigrant Selectivity, and the Sorting of Migrants by Skill Level

In this section we use the estimates from our regression analysis to shed light on
different dimensions of international migration. These analyses provide insights into the
scale, selectivity, and sorting of migrants. The first issue we address concerns fixed
costs, which according to theory should play a role in determining the scale of migration.
Despite the importance of fixed costs, there is little information on the magnitude of these
costs in the literature. Our framework allows us to estimate fixed migration costs that are
specific to each source-destination pair.
The estimates stem from the scale equation (4). If we include a dummy variable
for each source-destination pair in our sample, assuming as before that skill-varying costs
34

We attempted to compute asymptotic chi-square statistics along the lines of Hausman and McFadden
(1984) to test for stability across choice sets in all the regression coefficients. For the most part, the
asymptotic covariance matrices were singular, a finite-sample problem that often arises in Hausman tests.

36
j
are given by g sh
= x sh θ j , we obtain numerically identical estimates to those obtained by

estimating the selection equation (13). However, as a by-product, we obtain estimates of
-αfsh from the coefficients on the source-destination dummy variables. To recover an
estimate of fixed costs fsh, we divide those coefficients by our estimate of -α, where α is
the coefficient on wages. This provides estimates of fixed migration costs relative to an
omitted source-destination base pair, in thousands of 2000 U.S. dollars per year (the units
in which wages are measured). We choose the Mexico-U.S. pair as the base since it
involves the largest migration flow. Of course, these estimates reflect not only direct
monetary costs, but also the monetary value of psychic costs and source-specific
immigration policies imposed by the destination countries.
Estimates for each source-destination pair in our sample are shown in an online
appendix. Table 9 presents estimates for the subset of source and destination countries
that appear in the 25 source-destination pairs with the largest stocks of migrants. Within
each source-destination cell, the first entry is the estimated fixed migration cost. The
second entry is the number of emigrants from the source to the destination.
Table 9 illustrates a number of points. The first is that fixed costs matter. The US
is the low-cost destination for all the Western Hemisphere source countries except
Jamaica, and it receives more emigrants from those countries than any other destination.
At the same time, migration costs are only part of the story. For Chinese
emigrants, the cost of migrating to Canada and the US is about the same. Yet many more
go the US, presumably due to the higher wages there. The situation is similar for German
emigrants. Canada, France, and the UK are all lower-cost destinations than the US, yet
the US has more German immigrants than those three destinations combined.

37
Finally, several entries highlight the role of history. Germany is by far the lowestcost destination for Turkish emigrants, despite Turkey’s similar proximity to the other
European countries. The U.S. is the low-cost destination for Vietnam, despite the
country’s proximity to Australia and colonial ties to France. Presumably, these estimates
reflect Germany’s labor-recruitment strategy from the 1960s, America’s post-war asylum
policy in the 1980s, and the immigrant networks that have developed in their wake.
Moving from the scale of emigration to the selectivity of emigrants, Table 10
decomposes migrant selectivity from different source countries by region and income
level.35 The first column gives mean selectivity of emigrants by source-region, incomelevel cell. Selectivity is the dependent variable in the selection regression, which is the
difference in the log skill ratio between emigrants and non-migrants. Emigrants are
positively selected on average from all source regions. Mean selectivity ranges from a
high of 3.92 in low-income African countries to a low of 0.25 in the U.S. and Canada. It
is generally lower in the high-income countries than in low-income countries.
The next three columns use the regression results reported in column (2) of Table
4 to decompose mean selectivity into components attributable to source-destination
differences in skill-related wage differences, skill-varying migration costs, and a
residual.36 In Africa, migration costs account for about half of emigrant selectivity, with
wage differences and the residual accounting for about one-quarter each. Emigrants from
Africa appear to be much more positively selected than wage differences alone warrant.
35

Low (high) income countries are those whose low-skill wage is below (above) the minimum value of
this variable for the 15 OECD countries in the regression sample.
36
The contribution of wage differences to selection is the mean across source countries of the destinationsource difference in high and low-skill wages times the coefficient on wages in column (2) of Table 4; the
contribution of migration costs is the mean across source countries of the sum of the regressors in column
(2) of Table 4, each multiplied by its corresponding coefficient estimate; and the contribution of the
residual is the mean across source countries of the residual for the regression in column (2) of Table 4.

38
In the other low-income countries, wage differences play a larger role, accounting for
37% of positive selection in Latin America and the Caribbean, 48% in low-income Asia,
and 68% in Central and Eastern Europe. In high-income countries, migration costs
contribute strongly to positive selectivity. Wage differences by themselves would
actually contribute to negative selection in North America and high-income Asia and
only modest positive selection in Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Taking
Tables 9 and 10 together, for most source countries, migration costs appear to play a
large role in both how many individuals emigrate and which types emigrate.
We next ask how wage differences and skill-varying migration costs explain
differences in mean immigrant skills among the destination countries. The first column
of Table 11 presents our measure of immigrant skills, which is the mean log skill ratio
among immigrants in each destination country. Based on this measure, the US has the
most highly skilled immigrants on average, followed by Ireland and Canada.37 We seek
to explain the immigrant skill gap, defined as the difference between the mean log skill
ratio among immigrants in the U.S. and the mean log skill ratio among immigrants in
other destination countries. The immigrant skill gap is reported in column (2).
We use the sorting regression reported in column (4) of Table 4 to carry out the
decomposition. The decomposition explains the immigrant skills gap as a linear
combination of the differences in mean values of the regressors, using the regression

37

Other skill measures give somewhat different rankings. For example, Canada ranks first in the share of
immigrants with tertiary education. The reason for the difference is that the US has a lower share of
primary-educated immigrants than Canada. We focus on the log skill ratio because that is the skill measure
that follows from our model and the measure for which our regressions can provide a decomposition.

39
coefficients as weights. To aid interpretation, we report results in the form of the share of
the immigrant skill gap explained by each variable in the regression.38
Results are reported in columns (3) through (14). Column (3) shows that on
average the wage difference explains 58 percent of the immigrant skill gap; in all
destination countries it explains at least 25 percent. In Ireland, which has a relatively
small immigrant skill gap, it explains over 100 percent.
The next two columns show the importance of language. English explains at least
20 percent of the immigrant skill gap for each non-Anglophone destination country. The
role of common languages is smaller overall, but nevertheless important for some of
those destination countries whose languages are not widely spoken elsewhere.
The next three columns quantify the importance of distance. Contiguity has little
effect. Longitudinal differences and distance have largely offsetting effects owing to the
differing signs of their coefficients in Table 4. Among the policy variables, visa waivers
and the Schengen treaty explain relatively little of the immigrant wage gap. Asylum
policy, in contrast, has important effects. In seven of the destination countries, asylum
policy explains at least 20 percent of the immigrant skill disadvantage. In Canada and
New Zealand, in contrast, the skills gap would be over 10 percent larger were it not for
their relatively restrictive admissions of asylum seekers.

5. Conclusions

Two dominant features of international labor movements are positive selection of
individuals into migration and positive sorting of migrants across destinations. We show
that a simple model of income maximization can account for both phenomena.
38

Nothing constrains the share explained by any subset of components to be less than one.

40
In our selection regression, we find that migrants for a source-destination pair are
more educated relative to non-migrants, the larger is the skill-related difference in
earnings between the destination country and the source. That is, positive selectivity is
stronger where the reward to skill in the destination is relatively large. This result obtains
for wage differences expressed in levels, but not in logs. Log wage differences, which
capture cross-country differences in returns to skill, fail to account for bilateral migration
patterns because cross-country differences in returns to skill are dwarfed by cross-country
differences in labor productivity. On their own, cross-country differences in returns to
skill would predict negative selection of migrants, which occurs rarely in the data.
Positive sorting is a general prediction of income maximization. In our sorting
regression, the relative stock of more-educated migrants in a destination is increasing in
the level earnings difference between high and low-skilled workers. This correlation is
stronger when wage differences are adjusted for taxes, implying that migrants weigh
post-tax earnings when choosing a destination. The U.S. and Canada enjoy relatively
large post-tax skill-related wage differences, which largely account for their ability to
attract more educated migrants relative to other OECD countries.
In the sorting regression, we obtain qualitatively similar results when we use
wages constructed from micro data as when we approximate wages using aggregate
income data and impose the assumption of log normality. As a practical matter, this
means that one can obtain empirically meaningful estimates of skill-related wage
differences from commonly available data sources. The sorting regression allows one to
test income maximization even without source-country wage data, which makes our
approach applicable to a wide variety of settings.

41
Our analysis also shows that language, history, and policy affect migration.
English-speaking destinations draw higher-skilled immigrants than other destinations,
whereas former colonial powers draw lower-skilled immigrants from their former
colonies than from other source countries. Destinations with liberal refugee and asylum
policies draw relatively low-skilled immigrants, all else equal. Unfortunately, our ability
to say more about policy is limited by the sparseness of data allowing one to compare the
regimes of different destination countries. Our model provides a framework in which
comparative analysis of immigration policies could be undertaken, but with current
limitations in data we are limited in the analyses we can carry out.

Notes: Robust standard errors in parentheses. In addition to the variables shown, all regressions
include a dummy variable equal to one if the destination-country statistical office explicitly codes a
primary education category. The scale regression also includes a dummy equal to one for the
tertiary skill-group observations and interactions between that dummy and all variables shown. The
sorting regressions include a full set of source-country dummies.

Notes: Robust standard errors in parentheses. In addition to variables shown, all regressions include all variables shown or discussed in the note to Table 4.
Columns (1)-(3) report regressions in which we redefine skilled migrants to be migrants with either secondary or tertiary education; columns (4)-(9) differ from
the corresponding regressions in Table 4 only by in the inclusion of the indicated regressor; and columns (10) and (11) re-estimate the sorting regression using
the full sample of source-destination pairs for which destination wage data are available.

Notes: The table shows the mean value for the selection variable across source countries
in column (1) (the log odds of migration for those with tertiary education relative to the
log odds of migration for those with primary education), the mean value of the
contribution of wage differences to selection in column (2), the mean value of the
contribution of migration costs to selection in column (3), and the mean value of the
residual in column (4). The relevant regression results are those in column (2) of Table 4.
Low (high) income countries are those whose wage for low skill workers is below
(above) the minimum value of this variable for OECD countries in the regression sample.
