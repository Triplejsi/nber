Household Saving: An Econometric Investigation

ABSTRACT

Household or personal saving is recomputed to include net purchases of
consumer durables, net contributions to government life insurance and pension
reserves, and an adjustment for the inflation premium component in interest

income. These adjustments raise the measured household saving rate by nearly 5
percentage points in the 1965—75 period but result in an extremely sharp 7
percentage point decline in the rate between 1975 and the early 1980s.
A model of household saving behavior is then presented and estimated

using annual data from the 1952—82 period. While saving responds to numerous
influences, major swings in the adjusted saving rate —— a significant decline
in the 1950s and rebound in the early 1960s, as well as the decline since 1975
——

are

largely explained by two variables: the wealth/income ratio and the

growth rate of real income.

CHAPTER 4: HOUSEHOLD SAVING: AN ECONOMETRIC INVESTIGATION

INTRODUCTION

By official government accounts, the U.S. saves a substantially smaller

fraction of income than do other industrialized countries. Reasons for the
small fraction and the implications of it for America's future well—being are
widely discussed (Feldstein 1977; Boskin 1983) .

Contributing

to the low

national rate is a low, and apparently declining (Auerbach 1985), personal or

household saving rate. The measurement and determinants of household saving
are the subject of this chapter.

Major problems in measuring saving rates (Auerbach 1981; Blades and
Sturm 1982) raise questions as to just how low the U.S. household saving rate

is and how much it has declined recently. We consider the sources of
measurement error in the following section and compute an adjusted household
saving series that includes net purchases of consumer durables, net
contributions to government life insurance and pension reserves, and an

adjustment for the inflation premium component in interest income. These
adjustments raise the measured household saving rate by nearly S percentage
points in the 1965—75 period but result in an extremely sharp 7 percentage
point decline in the rate between 1975 and the early 1980s.
We then present a model of household saving behavior and estimate it

using annual data from the 1952—82 period. While saving responds to numerous
influences, major swings in the saving rate —— a significant decline in the
l9SOs and rebound in the early l960s, as well as the decline since 1975 ——

are

4—2

largely explained by two variables: the wealth/income ratio and the growth

rate of real income. A detailed interpretation of the empirical estimates is
provided in the text and summarized in the concluding section.

THE MEASUREMENT OF PERSONAL SAVING
Personal saving is calculated in the National Income and Product Accounts
(NIPA) as:

SNIA = YPERS — CEXP — TXPERS — INTPD,

(1)

where SNIA, YPERS, CEXP, TXPERS, and INTPD represent personal saving, income,
consumption expenditures, tax payments, and interest paid to business,1

respectively. Thus, measurement errors in any of the terms netted from
personal income, as well in personal income itself, will be embedded in SNIA

dollar for dollar.2 Below we discuss important measurement errors in each of
these terms and describe the adjustments we make to correct the errors.

Consumption (CEXP) and Tax (TXPERS) Adjustments
Theoretical models of consumption and saving behavior (for example, the Life
Cycle Hypothesis, the Permanent Income Hypothesis, and their derivatives) are

stated in terms of the consumption of service flows. These flows, rather than
consumption expenditures, are an argument in the utility function. To be
consistent with this theory, the component of consumer expenditures representing net investment in consumer durable goods should properly be considered

4—3

personal saving. The NIPA measure of personal saving, however, is constructed
on an expenditures rather than a service flow basis. Consequently, we adjust
SIA by the difference between the value of expenditures and the value of the
consumption of services (CON) to arrive at the theoretically appropriate
-

personal saving measure (SAV) :

SAV = SNIA + SDUR = SNIA +

(CEXP — CON)

,

(2)

w!iei-e SDUR is net investment in consumer durable goods. SOUR has risen,

erratically, from 15 billion 1972 dollars in the early 1950s to 35 billion in

the middle 1970s. Consumer durable goods are distinguished from nondurables
and services because they need not be consumed in the same period that they

are purchased. To the extent that net new purchases of consumer durable goods
are carried over to the next period, current net purchases will be a poor
measure of actual consumption in the period.

There are two measurement problems associated with tax liabilities. The
first concerns the treatment of government life insurance and employees

retirement fund activities. In the NIPA, these transactions are treated as
social insurance contributions (taxes) and payments (transfers) -

The flow of

funds treatment of the net contributions as household claims analogous to

private life insurance and pension reserves is more appropriate. Thus the net
oontributions, denoted by SGPEN, must be added to household saving (and

subtracted from government saving).3 This variable rose from 3 billion 1972
dollars in the early l9SOs to 20 billion in the early 1980s.

4—4

The second problem associated with the NIPA measurement of personal
taxes occurs because personal income taxes are measured on a cash payment

rather than a liability accrual basis. If individuals plan consumption and
saving over a long period of time, the relevant incOme tax variable will be
the one that represents their actual tax liabilities (see Peek 1982, 1983).
The tax adjustment (STAX) is constructed as:

STAX

TXPERS — TXLIAE,

(3)

where TXLIAB is tax accruals taken from annual issues of Statistics of Income,
Individual Income Tax Returns (501)

Most of the difference between tax

payments and accruals (which has fluctuated between —2 and +10 billion 1972
dollars) arises because the net refund for tax year t is included in the
liabilities of year t and in the cash payments of year t+1. The major
fluctuations in the net refunds series are largely due to differences in the
timing and magnitude of the changes in income tax rates and the corresponding
withholding schedules.

Expected Inflation and Personal Income (YPERS)

The final proposed personal saving adjustment is due to distortions in the
measurement of interest income (and payments) and capital losses (and gains)
during inflationary periods. The expectation of net capital losses on fixed.dollar financial assets leads to the incorporation of an inflation premium in

nominal interest rates to compensate investors for the losses. Part of the

4—5

household stock of fixed—dollar assets is being converted into a flow (the
inflation premium component) that is recorded inappropriately as income

received and capital losses incurred. Because saving is computed as income
less consumption and taxes, an extended period of anticipated inflation would
result in a substantial overstatement of the personal saving rate.

Three categories of interest payments are incorporated in personal
income: (1) monetary interest paid to persons, (2) imputed interest paid to
persons by depository institutions, and (3) imputed interest paid to persons
by life insurance companies and private noninsured pension funds.
category is also imputed to consumption expenditures.

The second

Consequently, if it is

rnismeasured, the error [being added to and subtracted from the right hand side

of (1)] is not included in measured personal saving. However, an overstate—
merit of the other two categories will lead to a dollar for dollar overstate-

ment of SNIA. Similarly, an overstatement of interest paid by consumers to
business (IWTPD) will result in a dollar for dollar understatement of SNIA.
Jump (1980) proposed that an inflation premium equal to the product of
the anticipated inflation rate and the stock of net household fixed—income
assets be subtracted from the official saving measure.4

Because this premium

implies immediate, complete adjustment of interest income to the current
anticipated inflation rate, it would substantially overstate, and be more
volatile than, the inflation premium component of NIPA interest income
included in personal saving during a period of rising inflation for three

reasons. First, binding interest rate ceilings on at least some demand and
savings accounts existed in the U.S. for the 1965—79 period. Once these

4—6

nominal interest rate ceilings were reached, the monetary interest payments on
such assets could incorporate an additional inflation premium only as rapidly

as ceiling interest rates were raised. Second, while additional interest from
financial institutions is imputed to individuals when interest rates
(inflation) rise, imputed interest generally. responds slug'jishly to interest

rate changes. Third, a significant part of fixed—valued household assets and
liabilities are long—term. For these instruments, coupon receipts/payments
adjust to an increase in inflation expectations only over time as new bonds

are issued to replace maturing bonds. (Yields adjust immediately via a
decline in the market price of the instruments.) This analysis suggests that
there will be a lagged adjustment of the inflation component of NIPA interest
income and expenses to an increase in the anticipated inflation rate.

(The

adjustment to a decrease in inflation will occur more rapidly to the extent
that high coupons are replaced by lower coupons as long—term debt is

refinanced at the lower market rate.) A final problem with Jumps adjustment is
that it ignores the tax liabilities incurred on monetary interest income: only
the net—of—tax inflation premium component can be used to maintain the real
value of net financial assets.

We have constructed inflation adjustments for both personal saving and
personal income that are based on the actual NIPA interest income measure.
The inflation component incorporated in personal saving is calculated as:

4—7

SPREM = (1 - TXINT) (RINTSAv — RINTSAV5O)ASAVJ

(4)

where ASAV represents the stock of net household fixed—income assets at the
beginning of the period,5 RINTSAV represents the ratio of the relevant
personal interest income to ASAV, RINTSAVSO is the 1950 value of RINTSAV, and

TXINT is the assumed tax rate on interest income.6 This procedure allocates
any increase in interest income (adjusted for the growth in net financial

assets) to our inflation component measure. It is likely that the inflation
component in 1950, if

any,

was extremely small. To the extent that it was

nonzero, our measure differs from the true component by a small constant but

still accurately reflects its movements. We have implicitly assumed that the
real interest rate built into interest income was constant during the 1950—82

period.7 The inflation—component adjustment to saving reaches 59

billion

The

calculation of the inflation premium embedded in NIPA. disposable

income is similarly calculated:
YPREM =

(1 — TXINT) (RINTYD — RINTYDSO)AYD1

(5)

where RINTYD is now the ratio of the sum of the two interest income categories
used to calculate SPREM and the imputed interest paid to persons by financial

institutions to AYD. RINTYD5O is its 1950 value, and AYD is all fixed—income
assets.

because the inflation component in INTPD

tax liabilities on intere.t income because it includes nontaxable imputed
interest paid to persons by depository institutions, life insurance companies

4—8

and private noninsured pension funds, as well as monetary interest payments to

persons. However, the imputed component is small relative to the total and
probably accounts for a less than proportionate share of the inflation
premium. t4oreover, TXIF4T does not reflect state and local taxes. The

adjusted personal saving rate can then be calculated asv

RSAVADJTX = SNIA—SPREN

(6)

Table 4—1 contains four personal saving rates. RSAVNIA is conventional
NIPA personal saving, RSAVADJ is our adjusted saving rate with TXINT

0,

——Place Table 4—1 Near Here——
RSAVADJTX includes the tax adjustment, and RSAVJUMP represents the personal

saving rate using Jump's method.8 Our tax—adjusted personal saving rate is
relatively stable through 1975. It does not rise in the late 1960s and early
1970s as does the official rate. While it does decline substantially after
1975, it remains positive. In sharp contrast, Jump's measure begins to
decline after 1967, becomes negative after 1975, and is sharply negative in

the early 1980s. The decline from 1967 to 1980 is 13 percentage points, 8
more than the decline in our series. About one—third of the excess decline
can be attributed to the overstatement of the inflation preinia and two—thirds
to the ignoring of taxes.

Adjusted Personal Saving Rates

We can now calculate our adjusted personal saving series. This series
incorporates the four adjustments to NIPA personal saving described above: (1)
net investment in consumer durable goods, (2) the treatment of contributions

saving, not taxes, (3) the

conversion of household taxes to an accrual basis, and (4) the inflation

component incorporated in interest income. The first three adjustments are
added to NIPA saving, while the inflation component is subtracted. The
adjusted personal saving measure is thus:

measurement problems associated with
property income during inflationary

periods.
The saving rate including all adjustments was in the 13 to 16 percent
range in the early to middle l950s before sliding into the 10 to 12 percent

range in the 1958—63 span. For the years 1965 to 1975, the rate again assumed

the high values of the middle l9SOs. From there, the rate fell to the 11 to
13 percent range in the second half of the 1970s and then down to the 7 to 8½
percent level in the early 1980s.

THE MODEL9

The model is developed in three parts. We begin with planned wealth
accumulation, then consider actual accumulation and its implication for the
saving relation, and finally consider the likely impact of different capital
gains components.

Planned Wealth Accumulation
Planned wealth accumulation is assumed to arise from the desires of individuals to smooth their pattern of consumption over their lifetime and to leave

bequests. Because human capital cannot be carried over into retirement years,
some of it must be transformed into nonhuman wealth to allow consumption after

retirement or to permit bequests. In addition, a precautionary motive arising
from the existence of unforeseen fluctuations in income (and perhaps needs)

would lead to the holding of a nonzero stock of nonhuman wealth by individuals
even if anticipated future consumption and income were equal.

Given an intertemporal utility function with current and future levels
of consumption (as well as any final bequest) as arguments, an individual
determines a desired consumption path by maximizing utility subject to his

perceived lifetime resources. Given an expected labor income path, the
interest rate, and the length of the retirement span, this desired consumption

path implies an associated wealth accumulation path. At any given time, the
end—of—period wealth required would be the level that would just allow the
individual to meet his future planned consumptipn path, asswning his expecta-

tions of the future are realized. Consistency requires that each period's
desired wealth level must be attainable if expectation, about the other

variables are realized. Thus, the planned change in wealth in any; period is
simply the difference between the level of desired end—of—period household
nonhuman wealth consistent with the desired consumption path, Wd, and actual
household nonhuman wealth at the end of period t—l (beginning of period t),

W1. The simultaneous determination of the desired wealth and consumption
paths requires this complete adjustment of actual to desired wealth within the
period because failure to attain the desired wealth stock by the end of the
period means that the future planned consumption path cannot be realized.

4—il

Desired wealth is assumed to depend on total resources [proxied by

expected disposable labor income (YDL) , expected transfer payments (YTR)
beginning—of—period nonhuman wealth (Wp, and expected capital gains

interest rate (RRATt) ,

dollar impacts to grow with the level of real economic activity.

The resources coefficients w1 through w4 should be positive. 10

We would

expect w5, the coefficient on GAP, also to be positive because a cyclical
increase in expected labor income would represent a smaller rise in perceived

total resources (and hence W )

Wc.Elc)

than/an increase representing an upward shift

in the time path of expected labor income. Thus, w1 would represent the
effect on desired wealth of such a rioncyclical rise in YDLe (that is,

unaccompanied by a decline in GAP). Owing to offsetting income and substitu-

tion effects, w6 could have either sign. The age composition variable is
intended to reflect any changes over time in the proportionof individuals in
the retirement (dissaving) stage of their lifetimes; thus

should be

negative.

The latter is assumed to be related to the unexpected components of disposable
labor income (YDL) ,

AW' =

income (YTR') , and capital gains (G)

+

(10)

b3GU.

The fractions of the unexpected components that are saved,

b1, b2 and b3, are

assumed to be near unity. Virtually all of any unexpected increments to
purchasing power would be added to wealth during the period in which they
occur because individuals are unable to incorporate these unknown increments

into their current expenditure plans. However, the longer the length of the
time period taken as the unit of analysis, the more opportunity there is to
adjust expenditure behavior within the current period and, therefore, the

smaller would be the bs.
As emphasized in the previous chapter, there are two ways in which
household nonhuman wealth can change: (1) net purchases of assets by
individuals (personal saving) and (2) the net change in the real value of

household assets previously held (capital gains). We can state this identity
as:

4—13

G.

(11)

With respect to current wealth, the source of its value is uniMportant.
Accrued capital gains embedded in an asset (less any accrued income tax
liability)11 are indistinguishable

from an equal amoànt of personal saving

asset. Recognizing that accrued capital

The final term (—G) represents

(11')

a displacement, or deflection, effeàt of

expected capital gains on personal saving!2 The extent to which the
displacement effect of expected capital gains on planned saving will be less
than one—for—one depends on the magnitude of the response of total planned
wealth accumulation to expected capital

gains (w4 in equation (8)J.

Disaggrtion of Capital Gains
The detailed discussion on capital gains in the
there are theoretical reasons to disaggregate

previous chapter suggests that

total capital gains by asset

groups. We can write total real capital gains as:

4—14

=
A1GHLN

+

A2GDUR

+ CSTK

+

+

GNFAPt

A3GNFAB,

(13)

where GHLN represents real capital gains on owner—occupied housing, land and
noncorporate equity; GDUR represents real capital gains on consumer durable
goods; and GSTK represents real capital gains on corporate equities. Real
capital gains on net financial assets have been separated into two components:
ONFAP (real capital gains on net financial assets due to changes in the
'3

general price level) and GNFAB (real capital gains on net financial assets due
to nominal bond price changes) .

As discussed in the previous chapter, we

would expect the A's to be between zero and unity, with A1 larger than A2
because housing and land are longer—lived than consumer durable goods. We
would expect A3 to be closer to zero the longer the intended holding period of

bond owners. A strict Hicks' prospective_income view would imply a value of
zero for A3.

Each of the gains components in (13) can be partitioned into expected
and unexpected components, where the expected component affects desired wealth
accumulation through the w4 coefficient in (8) and the unexpected component
influences the unexpected change in wealth through

in (10). However, the

values of w4 and b3 could vary across asset categories. The effect of an
expected capital gain on desired wealth would depend on its informational
content, that is, the magnitude of its effect on the perceived value of total

resources. This is related to how certain one is of the

expected gain

actually occurring and the extent to which current gains provide information

about future gains. A capital gain expected to recur in the future would
represent a larger increase in perceived total resources (and hence a higher
level of current and future consumption) than a one time gain. Thus, a
nonrecurring gain woul.d raise current consumption less and end—of—period

4—15

desired wealth level more. If we let w41 through w45 represent the w4s for
GHLNe, GDURe, GSTKe, GNFAPe and GNFABe, in that order, then we might expect
and w45 to be largest because stock and bond prices are more volatile than

goods prices. For example, the standard deviations of GSThe and GNFABe are
five and a half and four and a half times as large as their respective means.
At the same time, the standard deviations of GOURe and GNFAPe are roughly half

_____
and ehnsn-r
of their respective means. The standard deviation of GHLHe
is just under one and a half times its mean. Based on relative volatility, we
would expect to find

w43>w45>w41>w44>w42.

The b3's, on the other hand, will tend to be smaller the quicker that
individuals learn of unexpected gains and losses and can incorporate such

information into their behavioral decisions. Because people trade houses,
land and durables less often than stocks and bonds (for which we have daily
price quotes), we would expect b31 and b32 to exceed b33 and b35. Morover,
while much attention is given to trades of comparable houses by others because
houses constitute so much of one's wealth, little attention is apparently

accorded durable trades. Because changes in general price indices are
published with relatively short lags, b311 should lie betwein the two extremes.

Combining (8), (11'), and (13) —after restating the latter in terms of
expected and unexpected components —— we obtain:

We would expect to find A3<O and l>A7%A8>A1>A. While we expect A7, A8, and
A1 to be positive, as discussed earlier, A2 could take on a small negative

value. Similarly, we would expect A4 to be positive, A5 to be negative, and
are uncertain about the sign of A5 a priori. Given the preceding analysis, we
would expect all ten capital gains coefficients to be negative.
An important characteristic of the expected capital gains coefficients
is that the larger the effect of an increase in expected capital gains on
desired wealth, the smaller the expected capital gains coefficient in the

saving equation. This is related to the deflection effect discussed earlier.
The more the expected capital gain raises desired wealth, and thus planned
wealth accuxnuation, the less it deflects (or reduces) saving.

Consequently,

a large behavioral effect on desired wealth would be associated with a

relatively small effect on personal saving. However1 the interpretation of
the expected capital gains coefficients is complicated by the presence of the

A' in A9, A10, and A13. A value of A less than unity, indicating that the
capital gains are only partially viewed as additions to wealth, would further

reduce (in absolute value) the expected capital gains coefficients. In fact,
the less the capital gains are viewed as additions to wealth, the nearer to

zero are the values of A9, A10, and A13. Thus, relatively large effects on

4—17

desired wealth or relatively small effects on the perceived actual change in

wealth will both result in values of A9, A10 and A13 very near zero. Of the
unexpected capital gains coefficients, we would expect to find A14 and A15

very near zero, and A16, A17, and A18 having valuesbetween zero and A11, A12,
and A13, respectively.

EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS

This section is divided into four parts. After discussing the data, we
present estimates of the basic model and of an extended model. An interpretation of the preferred estimated relationship concludes the section.

Data Specification
Estimation of the saving equation requires proxies for each of the relevant

variables. The saving, income, wealth, and capital gains variables are all
per capita constant 1972 dollar magnitudes. The dependent variable, SAy, is
the sum of the NIPA personal saving measure (SNIA) and net investment in
consumer durable goods (SDUR) .

This

is consistent with the theoretically

appropriate measurement of consumption as service flows rather than as

expenditures. The measurement error terms (SGPEN, STAX, and SPREM) have been

described above. They, too, are divided by population. Population and the
share aged 65 or older (AGE) are from the Economic Report of the President.

The beginning—of—period value of household wealth (W) is taken from the

Balance Sheet Accounts. Thus it does not include the real value of unfunded
pension wealth, a series that rose markedly during the 1950—80 period. Our
measure of the GNP gap (GAP) ,

potential

less actual GNP, relies on the

potential GNP series calculated by the President's Council of Economic

Advisors and the NIPA GNP measure. It is lagged one period to avoid

4—18

simultaneity problems. The real after—tax interest rate (RRAT) is calculated
as the after—tax yield on one—year Treasury bills less the Livingston survey

measure of the one—year expected inflation rate. The Treasury bill yield is
the average for the preceding December. The effective marginal tax rate is
the TXINT series.

The income measures are based on NIPA data. To calculate disposable
labor income, total personal tax liabilities must be allocated between labor

and property income. Personal labor income is the sum of the NIPA measures of
wages and salaries, other labor income, and a proportion of proprietor's

income. Using SOl data on federal income tax liabilities and wage income and
extending a series on federal income tax liabilities on wages and salaries

provided by Charles Steindel, we were able to allocate Sot federal and NIPA
state and local income tax liabilities between labor and property income.
Personal social security contributions were included in labor's share of tax
liabilities.

The calculation of the capital gains proxies from balance sheet account
data and the decomposition of the capital gains series into their expected and

unexpected elements were described in the previous chapter. Disposable labor
income and transfer payments are divided into their expected and unexpected

components by a similar regression procedureJ4
The mean, high, and low values for the variables and their scale are

listed in Table 4—4. The saving, income, capital gains, wealth and gap
——Place Table 4—4 Near Here——
variables

are all 1972 dollars per capita. Both AGE and REAP are measured in

decimals (in the equations they are measured as deviations from their means)
The minutes—to—midnight series will be discussed below.

Estimates for the Basic Model
Table 4—5 presents estimates of variants of equation (14) .

Although

the

specification differs somewhat, the estimates presented in column 1 are

——Place

consistent

Table 4-5 Near Here——

with the general findings of Peek (1983). As predicted by our

measurement error discussion, the tax liabilities adjustment (STAX) has an
estimated coefficient that does not differ significantly from minus one (t—
statistic = 0.69)

The relative magnitudes of the income coefficients are as

predicted. The YTRE coefficient does not exceed its estimated standard error.
The unreasonably large estimated effect of YTRU may be related to several

retroactive increases in social security
Steindel

benefit levels (see Modigliani and

(1977)]. Because NIPA saving is measured as a residual, any

retroactive

and unexpected increase in disposable income is automatically

forced into measured saving leading to an overstatement of the marginal

response of saving to unexpected transfer payments. The coefficients on
wealth and population over 65 have the predicted negative sign. The GNP—gap
coefficient has the incorrect sign, but does not differ significantly from

zero. The interest—rate coefficient is negative and statistically insignificant.

Initially all ten capital gains proxies were included in the saving

equation. To reduce the number of explanatory variables to a more manageable
size, the capital gains proxies with estimated coefficients having t—

statistics below unity were eliminated from the equation. Because there were
a number of strong simple correlations between pairs of capital gains
variables making it very difficult to pinpoint individual effects, the proxies

were eliminated sequentially. First, GHLNU and GDURU (with t—statistics of
—0. l7and —0. 49,

respectively)

were eliminated. Their near zero effects are

consistent with our expectations. Next, GNFABE (with a t—statistic of 1.45)
and then GNF'APE (with a t—statistic of 2.07) were eliminated. Although we
were using a rule that estimated coefficients should exceed their estimated
standard errors for retention of the capital gains variables in the equations,

we eliminated GNFAPE and GNFABE because they had the wrongsign and always had
t—statistics below unity (with the appropriate negative signs) in later

specifications, Similarly, we retained ONFAPO and GNFABU for comparison

purposes because they meet the criterion in our later key equations. Of the
six remaining capital gains coefficients, two (GDUBE and GSTJCU) differ

significantly from zero. Contrary to our predictions, however, unexpected
capital gains on corporate equities have a larger (although not significantly

so) effect on saving than do their expected counterpart. Furthermore, the
coefficient on unexpected gains on net financial assets due to changes in the
general price level has the wrong sign but is much less than its estimated
standard error.

The rather high correlations between pairs of explanatory variables make
it very difficult to pinpoint the individual effects of the explanatory

variables on personal saving. For example, the pairwise correlations between
W, YDLE, YTRE, and AGE range (in absolute value) between 0.89 and 0.98.
Furthermore, the pairwise correlations of BRAT and GDUBE with these variables
range from 0.61. to 0.79. First—differencing the data substantially reduces
the collinearity between pairs of explanatory variables, thereby making it

easier to disentangle the separate influences of each explanatory variablej5
Column 2 presents the results of reestimating the basic saving equation using

changes rather than levels of the data. While many of the estimated
coefficients are little changed from their column 1 values, there are a number
of notable exceptions.

4—21

The point estimate of the income—tax—liabilities_adjustment coefficient
(—0.989) is now much nearer minus unity (t—statistic =

0.02)

The effects of

beginning—of—period wealth, expected disposable labor income, and unexpected

disposable labor income have all increased. The estimated wealth effect is
now slightly closer to the —0.03 to —0.M5 value typically obtained. On the
other hand, the 0.57 IDLE coefficient is somewhat larger than the 0.3 to 0.5

expected coefficient on disposable income cited in the literature.16 However,
because disposable labor income is only about 75 percent of total disposable
income, an estimated coefficient in the range of 0.4 to 0.67 would be
consistent with a disposable income coefficient in the range of 0.3 to 0.5.
In fact, Juster and Taylor (1975) ,

using

a disposable labor income measure,

found effects consistent with an estimate in the range of 0.4 to 0.5 in our
specification.

17

The estimated coefficient on expected transfer payments now has a small
(statistically insignificant) negative value, while the estimated effect of

unexpected transfer payments is now below unity as our theory predicts. The
GNP gap coefficient has the predicted positive sign, although it is still
statistically insignificant, and the real after—tax interest rate has a larger

(and still statistically insignificant) negative effect. With respect to the
capital gains coefficients, the GNFAPU coefficient now has the correct sign
(although both GNFAPU and GNFABU still have estimated coefficients exceeded by
their estimated standard errors) .

The estimated effects of expected capital

gains on durables and unexpected gains on both corporate equities and on net

assets due to nominal bond price changes have each declined, causing

significantly from zero. Due to the slight increase in the

effect of GSTKE and the sharp decline in the GSTKU effect, the two effects are
now almost identical.

As noted in the development of our model, the interpretation of the

capital gains coefficients is rather complicated. The magnitude of the
estimated coefficients represents a combination of effects: one related to the

effect of capital gains on desired wealth (the w4's) or on unplanned wealth

accumulation (the b3s) and one related to the extent to which the capital

on the w4.'s alone, we would expect to find GDURE and GNFAPE with the largest
effects and G$TKE and GNFABE with the smallest. To the extent that the A.1 's
are below unity, the effects of GHLNE, GDURE, and GNFAEE would be reduced

somewhat. In fact, we do find a relatively large effect of expected capital
gains on durables due to their relatively small effect on desired wealth, even
after incorporating the A, effect which tends to reduce the extent of

deflection. However, its estimated standard error is even larger. The much
smaller estimated effects on saving of the other expected capital gains
proxies are probably related to their relatively larger effects on desired
wealth (and hence smaller deflection effects) .

This

is certainly the case

with GULNE relative to GDURE because our theoretical analysis suggests that A1>

A2. Again, the relatively smaller effect of GSTKE is consistent with our
theory. The combination of a relatively large value of w45 and a value of
1 probably accounts for the absence of GNFABE.

The absence of unexpected gains on housing, land and noncorporate equity
and on consumer durables is consistent with our prior analysis suggesting

values of b31 and b32 very near unity. This is reinforced to the extent that

4—23

A1 and A2 are below unity. Small negative effects of GSTKU, GNFAPtJ, and
GNFABU would be consistent with the relatively smaller values of b33, b34, and

b35. None of the three unexpected capital gains effects, however, differs
significantly from zero.

We now turn to a consideration of the remaining two ñeasurement error

terms, SGPEN and SPREM. Column 3 presents the results of reestimating the
column 2 equation with these two additional explanatory variables. We retain
the first—differenced specification because the levels of both these variables

are highly correlated with the other explanatory variables. The standard
error of the equation drops dramatically (over 40 percent) from 22.54 to only

13.16. Most of this decline is due to the introduction of SPREM.18 All three
of the measurement error terms have coefficients that differ significantly

from zero, but not from their predicted values. The t—statistic for the null
hypothesis that the STAX coefficient is minus one is only 0.39. similarly,
the t—statistics for the SGPEW coefficient differing from minus one and for
the SPREM coefficient differing from plus one are 0.13 and 1.34, respectively.
Thus, we can not reject any of the hypothesized restrictions.

The primary differences between the coefficients on the other variables
are: the wealth and AGE coefficients increase substantially, the RHAT
coefficient becomes positive (but is still less than its standard error), the
GHLNE coefficient drops sharply and loses its significance, and the

coefficients on both GDURE and GSTKE increase and become significant. The
GSTKE effect now exceeds that of GSTKTJ as our theory predicts. The
coefficients on unexpected capital gains on net financial assets due to
nominal bond price changes and due to changes in the general price level both
rise (in absolut.e value) and exceed their estimated standard errors.

4—24

Column 4 imposes the hypothesized plus or minus unity restrictions on

the measurement error terms. That is, the dependent variable is now our
adjusted saving measure, SADJ. The standard error of the equation is reduced
slightly from 13.16 to 12.71. Except for the doubling of the GHLNE effect,
the estimated coefficients on the capital gains proxies are only slightly

altered. The wealth and expedted transfer payments effects also decline
somewhat.

(These reactions to the imposition of the coefficient restrictions

may be related to the strong trend elements contained in SGPEN, SPREM, W, and
?TRE)

The estimated effects of expected and unexpected capital gains on
corporate equity are very similar to each other in each specification we have

considered. This could be due to problems in separating total corporate
equity capital gains into expected and unexpected components. Consequently,
we also considered an alternative measure of expected gains on corporate.

equity based on the Livingston survey expectations of Standard and Poor's

Industrial Stock Price index. The expected percentage increase (or decrease)
was multiplied by the beginning—of—period value of household corporate equity

holdings to calculate GSTKE. The difference between this measure and the
actual stock market capital gains was taken as the unexpected component.
Because the Livingston data are available only after 1952, the sample period

for this regression is 1954—82. The results are very similar to those
obtained when the specification in column 4 is reestimated over the same
sample period, indicating that our results are robust with respect to quite

different measures of expected stock market capital gains. The SEE of the
equation with the alternative GSTKE measure is 12.19, slightly lower than our
original specification when estimated over the same sample period (12.52)
The Livingston GSTKE and GSTKU estimated coetficients are —0.0401 and —0.0214

4—25

with standard errors of 0.0191 and 0.004, respectively. The similarity in
the magnitudes of the effects may be due to individuals reacting similarly to
both the expected and unexpected components because information on actual

stock market capital gains and losses is available on a next day basis. If
that is the case, we lose very little by considering totaistock market
capital gains because the particular decomposition of total stock market
capital gains is irrelevant.

Further Estimates
The one unappealing aspect of the coefficients in column 4 is the implied

response of saving to changes in the age distribution of the population. The
three percentage point increase in the share of population over age 65,
together with the —4.29 coefficient, yields a decline in the personal saving

ratio in the last 30 years of over 13 percentage points! One might contend
that this response is 5 to 10 times too great. On the other hand, one might
argue that older households were not otdy growing in relative importance but
that each was saving relatively less, possibly owing to a sharp rise in social
security wealth and the certainty of this wealth (due to indexation in

1972) }9 Further, an increased tendency toward early retirement has occurred
concurrently with the aging of the population; between 1954 and 1980, the
labor force participation rate of males between the ages of 55 and 64 declined

from 0.88 to 0.72. This could make a coefficient as large, in absolute

magnitude, as —1.5 plausible. The remaining columns in Table 4—S reflect
attempts to reduce the age coefficient to a more reasonable value without
losing the appealing aspects of column 4.

4—26

The major additions in column 5 are a constant term in our difference
equation and Slemrod's (1984) minutes—to—midnight or nuclear fear variable
(scaled by expected labor income) .

In

Slemrod's view, increased fear of a

nuclear holocaust (decreased expected life span and ability to leave a

bequest) would likely reduce the propensity to save. The equation also
combines some like variables with similar. impacts (expected and unexpected

labor income, expected and unexpected stock market gains, and unexpected gains

on net financial assets due to changes in the general price level and to
changes in nominal bond prices) and deletes some variables with negligible
impacts (expected transfer income and expected gains on net financial assets
due to changes in the general price level) .

As can be seen, the constant and

fear variable have t—ratios slightly above unity and reduce the age coeffi-

cient by nearly 20 percent. The coefficient on the nuclear fear variable
suggests that a ten minute increase in the clock, the largest observed
variation, would raise the saving rate by almost a full percentage point.20
Not only is the constant term insignificantly different from zero, but

it is difficult to interpret. One general interpretation is the negative
impact of the growth in social security (and other unfunded pension) wealth on
saving; this would be consistent with the large and significant negative
impact of real nonhuman wealth (t ratios over 4 in columns 4 and 5) .

However,

social security wealth certainty has not been growing in the 1980s. To
account for this, the constant in column 5 was replaced, in turn, by constants

that were truncated (became zero) in 1974, 1977, and 1980. The best fit was
obtained with the latter variable and is reported as column 6 in the table.
As can be seen, this truncated constant is significantly different from zero.
Also, the AGE coefficient exhibits a further decline, although it is still at
least double what we would consider a plausible magnitude.

4—27

While the truncated constant may reflect something other than the impact

of unfunded pensions, we shall accept this interpretation. Because Feldstein
(1982) is the most visible and vocal advocate of the negative unfunded—

pensions effect, we compare our results with his. He concludes that personal
saving was reduced by $58 billion in 1976, his last year of analysis, when NIA
personal saving was $69 billion (p. 636) .

Moreover, three—quarters of this

reduction was due to the increase in social security wealth since 1951, the
year our analysis begins; that is, the growth in social security wealth

between 1951 and 1976 reduced personal saving in 1976 by $43.5 billion. To
obtain our 1976 impact on the level of personal saving per capita, we multiply

the 10.8 coefficient in our change equation by 25. The result of $270 is then
compared with the 1976 NIA measure of personal saving per capita of $426.
This ratio, 0.63, is the same as that computed by dividing Feldstein's $43.5

by $69. The two estimates, then, are capatible, suggesting both specifica—
tions may be capturing the same phenomenon.

21

In our final estimates, we arbitrarily halved the age coefficient to

—1.5, its maximum plausible value. The result was a sharp increase in the
coefficient on the truncated constant to —15 (t

Interpretation of the Estimates
In the absence of permanent changes in expected capital gains, unexpected
transfer payments and the GWP gap, these variables have only a temporary

impact on household saving. The largest stock market losses occurred in
1973—74, sandwiched in between relatively large gains in both 1971—72 and

1975—76. As a result, household saving was about 10 percent higher in 1973—74
than in the surrounding years. Large expected gains on housing, land and
noncorporate equity in 1977—78 reduced personal saving by over 5 percent;
systematic large losses on durables raised saving by a like amount in the late

l970s and early l9SOs. More generally, the GAP variable and its coefficient
suggest that household saving is about 10 percent greater in the early stages

of economic recoveries than in the late stages of economic booms. Finally,
unexpected transfers only rarely have affected saving by 5 percent, although a
large jump in government unemployment insurance benefits in 1975 associated
with legislation to extend both the duration and coverage of benefits
increased saving by over 10 percent.

Determinants of longer—term, major shifts in the saving ratio are

probably of more interest. The adjusted saving rate, as computed in Table 4—
3, is reproduced at roughly 7 year intervals in the top row of Table 4—6. The
ratio fell sharply in the l9SOs, reversed itself in the 1960s, held

Lncomr' ratio. The q'.'neral inverse relationship between the two rows is

obvious. The remainder of the Table refers to changes between the periods.
The next two rows contain the percentage changes in real income and wealth per
capita.

In three of the four intervals, real wealth grew at a roughly 21

percent rate, the first two being dominated by equity gains and the last by
the land—housing surge; the negligible real gains in the 1968—74 period were
the result of equity losses offsetting land—housing gains (see Chapter 3 for a

fun discussion of these real wealth changes). Real income grew less rapidly
on average and was more volatile, with enormous real growth in the l960s and

minimal growth since the middle l970s. The wealth—income ratio rose in the
first and last intervals owing to large wealth growth and declined in the
middle two intervals, first because of the incredibly large income growth and
then because of the stock market debacle.
The remainder of the Table indicates the change in the saving ratio

between periods and the source of the change. The dominant role of the
wealth—income ratio in the major declines in the saving ratio in the l?SOs and
late 1970s is obvious; also contributing to these declines, especially the

latter, was the aging of the population. In the intervening two intervals,
these two influences were roughly offsetting. Some of the rise ,in the saving
ratio in the l960s is explained by the relaxation of interpatiônal tensions

following solution of the Cuban missile crisis and passage o the Partial Test
Ban Treaty in the early 1960s, and part of the recent decline n the rate owes
to increased tensions between the U.S. and the Soviets, The sharp rise in the

4—30

saving rate in the 1960s was due to the above—noted enormous growth in real
income; because the marginal propensity to save is greater than the average1

increases in income raise the average savin9 rate.
While the real—after—tax interest rate has a negligible direct impact on

household saving, this variable appears to have a major indirect effect. As
one might expect, real cumulated gains on housing, land and noncorporate equity
(which are related to land) and the real after—tax interest rate exhibit a

statistically significant negative correlation. An increase in the interest
rate leads to a downward revaluation of the assets and a decrease to an upward

revaluation. These gains (or losses) then feed into the level of household
wealth which has a negative influence on personal saving.
The real after—tax interest rate (BRAT) declined from 0.0183 in 1970 to

—0.0210 in 1980—81. To obtain an impact of this decline on wealth (and then
on saving) , we estimated a relationship between cumulated real gains on

housing, land and noncorporate equity (TGI{LN) and RBAT over the 1952—82

period, obtaining (standard errors in parentheses):

Multiplying 17489 by 0.0393 (the change in RRAT)qives an induced increase in
TGHLN (and hence wealth at the beginning of the 1981—82 period) of $688

billion or 2992 per capita 1972 dollars. Using the estimated wealth
coefficient of —0.0383 from column 7 of Table

we; obtain a reduction in

saving between 1970 and 1981—82 of' 114.6 per capita 1972 dollars. Thus, in
the absence of the sharp reduction in RRAT (and the associated surge in TGHLN
and wealth) ,

the

average value of our adjusted personal saving measure in

4—31

1981—82 would have been 332.8 rather than 218.2 per capita 1972 dollars. The
1981—82 saving rate then would have been 11.27 percent, or 50 percent more

than the observed 7.39 percent value. This calculation overstates the effect
because a lower level of wealth in the earlier years due to the absence of
cumulated gains on housing, land and noncorporate equity wàuld have induced

additional saving. Allowing for this feedback, the 1980—81 saving ratio still
would have been about 10 percent or 2½ percentage points higher than the
observed ratio.

SUMMARY

The WIPA measurement of personal saving is incorrect in a number of important

respects. These include the treatment of net purchases of consumer durables
as consumption instead of saving, the treatment of net contributions to
government life insurance and retirement funds as taxes instead of saving, and
the measurement of personal taxes on a cash—payment rather than liability—

accrual basis. Finally, because inflation converts part of fixed—income
wealth into an interest income flow (some of the inflation premium in new
issue interest rates is built into recorded after—tax interest income), the

NIPA measure overstates saving in an inflationary period. We have computed an
adjusted saving variable to correct for all of these errors, and we have
obtained empirical support for the validity of our corrections.
Our adjusted saving rate exhibits some major movements in the 1951—82

period. The rate declines from over 15 percent in the early l9SOs to around
11 percent in the early 1960s and then rebounds to over 14 percent by the

middle 1960s. After approximately a decade of relative stability, the rate
plummets in the second half of the 1970s to under 8 percent in the early
1980s.

4—32

The most important variables explaining longer—run swings in the saving

rate are real wealth and income. Large real gains on equities and on hpusing
and land in the second halves of the l9SOs and l970s, respectively, account
for most of the sharp declines in the saving ratio in these periods- .

While

wealth also grew rapidly during most of the 1960s, again otiing largely to

stock—market-gains, the saving ratio actually increased because of

unparalleled real income growth. This growth raised the saving ratio both
directly, because the marginal propensity. to save out of income exceeds the

average propensity, and indirectly, because the wealth—income ratio is
lowered.

Acting almost continuously Lo depress the saving—ratio throughout the
1951—80 period was a marked increase in the retired portion of the population
and rapid growth in unfunded pension wealth (both social security and pensions
for government employees) .

The former resulted from both a three percentage

point increase in the share of the population over age 65 (from 8 percent to

11) and a doubling of males below age 65 choosing early retirement. The
precise role of these two factors is uncertain, but together they would have
reduced the saving rate to zero in the absence of real income growth (the
marginal greater than average phenomenon)

The real after—tax interest rate (which obviously measures the returns
to savers with some imprecision) does not have a direct influence on the

saving ratio. However, an indirect channel of influence exists, namely a
strong significant negative relationship between the market value of housing,

land and noncorporate equity and the real after—tax interest rate. In fact,
the sharp decline in this rate underlies the fall in the saving ratio
attributable to the housing and land boom in the second half of the l970s.

4—33

Short—run movements in the saving ratio are caused by the volatility of

the stock market and of economic activity generally. Apparently owing to
income uncertainty asociated with unemployment, the saving rate is higher in

the early stages of an upswing than in the late stages. Finally, there is
some weak evidence that heightened fear of nuclear war lowers the saving ratio
and relaxation of international tensions raises the ratio.

NOTES 4

1. Interest payments on mortgage and home improvement loans are not included
in interest paid by consumers to business. Because homeowners are
treated as business operators in the NIPA, these payments are counted as
interest paid by business to business and are not included in personal
income -

2.

Net personal transfer payments to foreigners is also subtracted from

personal income in calculating SNIA. We have ignored this term in our
theoretical analysis because of its relatively small magnitude and
because it is not central to our analysis.

3.

For a discussion of the flow of funds treatment, see Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System, (1975) : 31—33.

The data on SGPEN were

supplied by their flow of funds section.

4. The inflation adjustment was first addressed by Poole (1972) -

His

measure of the inflation premium in disposable income was constructed as:

YPREM =

YINT,

where Ir, RCB, and lINT represent the anticipated inflation rate, the
corporate bond rate, and net interest income.

5. Fixed—income assets are measured net of consumer credit, but mortgage

debt is not subtracted. This is because interest payments on consumer
credit are subtracted from personal income in constructing personal
saving while interest payments on mortgages are not (see footnote 1)

6.

-

The TXINT series is constructed from the SOT data supplemented with

tables provided by Charles Hicks. Following Wright (1969), the tax rate
is calculated as a weighted average of the marginal personal income tax

rate for each adjusted gross income class. The weight for each class is
equal to its share of the total interest received by all income classes.

7.

This is not meant to suggest that we think the real interest rate was

constant over this period. In fact, there is ample empirical evidence
that the real rate has varied cyclically (Hendershott and Huang, 1984,
for example) .

However, that variation has been on the order of only two

percentage points. Moreover, the variation in the rate built into
interest income is substantially less given the lags with which this

income reflects rate movements. In contrast, interest income incorporated a major (6 to 8 percentage point) trend increase in expected
inflation between 1950 and 1981.

8. This series is calculated as (SNIA — ITASAV)/(YD — wAYD), where Jr is the
one—year expected inflation rate at the end of the previous year from the
Livingston survey data supplied by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.

9. The model is similar to that of Peek (1983)

10. while an increase in expected transfer payments would tend to raise wd by
increasing the perceived value of total lifetime resources, it would at
the same time discourage the accumulation of wealth for retirement to the
extent that it leads to the expectation of a higher retirement income

(e.g., social security benefits). Similarly, an increase in unemployment
benefits could reduce the need for precautionary wealth held to carry an

individual through a period of less than normal earnings. If these
influences more than offset the positive total resources effect, w2 would
be negative.

11. We will ignore any accrued income tax liabilities on accrued capital
gains. Such taxes are paid only upon realization, if ever, and ar& based
on nominal rather than real capital gains. Bailey (1969) found that the
effective tax rate on accrued capital gains was very small, perhaps as
low as 5 to 10 percent.

12. Nichols (1970) investigates some implications of this deflection issue
whereby real capital gains crowd out asset accumulation in satisfying
wealth accumulation motives.

14. Recall that adjustment to personal saving for the inflation premium
component in interest income requires a compensating adjustment to (the

expected component of) GNFAP. Consequently, in the equations that follow
our measure of the expected component of GNFAP will be the sum of our

original (Chapter 3) measure of GNFAPE and SPREM. This is equivalent to
reducing expected capital 'osses by the inflation premium component in
net interest income.

15. Plosser and Schwert (1978) suggest differencing as a crude test of model
specification. The results from the levels regression of a correctly
specified model should be confirmed by the results from the reestimation
of the equation using the first differences of the data.

16. Tobin and Dolde (1971: 101) suggest that a consumption function
specification containing disposable income and wealth would have
coefficients on these variables in the ranges of 0.5 to 0.7 and 0.03 to

0.05, respectively. This implies a disposable income coefficient between
0.3 and 0.5 for the corresponding saving equation.

17. When the equation is reestimated omitting some of the variables that are
highly correlated with IDLE (W, AGE, and GHLNE) , as well as GAP, the

estimated coefficient on IDLE drops to only 0.28, while the estimated
coefficient on IDLU (0.59) is little affected.

18. When only SPREM was added to the specification in column 2, its estimated
coefficient was 1.28 (S.E. =

0.30) and the SEE was reduced from 22.54 to

15.51.

19. Kane (1985) suggests this effect.

20. This estimate, which is obviously measured with some imprecision, is
slightly less than half the impact on the NIA private saving rate
obtained by Slemrod (1984) .

We

obtained a much larger impact when the

NIA personal saving rate, rather than our corrected rate, was employed as
the

dependent variable.

21. A similar estimate, again employing a different data set and methodology,
was recently obtained by Carmichael (1984) .

See Feldstein (1982) for

references to numerous studies, micro and macro, on the saving impact of
social security.

22. There is an implicit constant term in the saving—levels equation of —400.
Given the —10 on the truncated constant in the changes equation, the
"constant" in the levels equation rises, in absolute value, by 10 each

year through 1979. If expected real labor income per capita were to
increase by 2½ percent the first year and then by slightly decreasing
amounts in later years, the unfunded pensions effect on the average
saving rate would precisely offset the effect of real income growth
(higher marginal than average rate) leaving the average saving rate

unchanged. Of course, real income per capita grew by far less than 2
percent per year except in the 1960s when the growth rate was nearly 3
percent.
