This Time is Different: A Panoramic View of Eight Centuries of Financial Crises
Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff
NBER Working Paper No. 13882
March 2008
JEL No. E6,F3,N0
ABSTRACT
This paper offers a "panoramic" analysis of the history of financial crises dating from England’s fourteenth-century
default to the current United States sub-prime financial crisis. Our study is based on a new dataset
that spans all regions. It incorporates a number of important credit episodes seldom covered in the
literature, including for example, defaults and restructurings in India and China. As the first paper
employing this data, our aim is to illustrate some of the broad insights that can be gleaned from such
a sweeping historical database. We find that serial default is a nearly universal phenomenon as countries
struggle to transform themselves from emerging markets to advanced economies. Major default episodes
are typically spaced some years (or decades) apart, creating an illusion that "this time is different"
among policymakers and investors. A recent example of the "this time is different" syndrome is the
false belief that domestic debt is a novel feature of the modern financial landscape. We also confirm
that crises frequently emanate from the financial centers with transmission through interest rate shocks
and commodity price collapses. Thus, the recent US sub-prime financial crisis is hardly unique. Our
data also documents other crises that often accompany default: including inflation, exchange rate crashes,
banking crises, and currency debasements.

I. Introduction
The economics profession has an unfortunate tendency to view recent experience in
the narrow window provided by standard datasets. With a few notable exceptions, crosscountry empirical studies on financial crises typically begin in 1980 and are limited in
several other important respects.1 Yet an event that is rare in a three decade span may not
be all that rare when placed in a broader context.
This paper introduces a comprehensive new historical database for studying
international debt and banking crises, inflation, currency crashes and debasements. The
data covers sixty-six countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America, and
Oceania. The range of variables encompasses, among many other dimensions, external and
domestic debt, trade, GNP, inflation, exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices.
The coverage spans eight centuries, generally going back to the date of independence for
most countries, and well into the colonial period for some. As we detail in an annotated
appendix, the construction of our dataset has built heavily on the work of earlier scholars.
However, it also includes a considerable amount of new material from diverse primary and
secondary sources. In addition to a systematic dating of external debt and exchange rate
crises, the appendix to this paper also catalogues dates for domestic inflation and banking
crises. For the dating of sovereign defaults on domestic (mostly local currency) debt, see
Reinhart and Rogoff (2008).
The paper is organized as follows. Section II summarizes highlights from a first
view of the extended dataset, with special reference to the current conjuncture. Among
other things, we note that policymakers should not be overly cheered by the absence of
major external defaults from 2003 to 2007, after the wave of defaults in the preceding two

decades. Serial default remains the norm, with international waves of defaults typically
separated by many years, if not decades.
Many foreign investors and policymakers today seem lulled by the fact that many
emerging market governments have become less reliant on foreign currency external
borrowing than in the recent past. Countries have instead been relying more on domestic
currency debt issued in local markets. Yet, as we show in a companion paper, reliance on
domestic debt is hardly new, and the view that domestic debt can be largely ignored in
looking at external debt sustainability is hard to reconcile with the extensive historical
experience.2
Our dataset reveals that the phenomenon of serial default is a universal rite of
passage through history for nearly all countries as they pass through the emerging market
state of development. This includes not only Latin America, but Asia, the Middle East and
Europe. We also find that high inflation, currency crashes, and debasements often go handin-hand with default. Last, but not least, we find that historically, significant waves of
increased capital mobility are often followed by a string of domestic banking crises.
Section III of the paper gives a brief overview of the sample and data. Section IV
catalogues the history of serial default on external debts, from England’s defaults in the
Middle Ages, to Spain’s thirteen defaults from the 1500s on, to twentieth-century defaults
in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Our database marks the years that default episodes are
resolved as well as when they began, allowing us to look at the duration of default in
addition to the frequency.
Section V of the paper looks at the effect of global factors on sovereign default,
including commodity prices and capital flows emanating from the center countries. We

2

These issues are analyzed in detail in Reinhart and Rogoff (2008).

2

show how shocks emanating from the center countries can lead to financial crises
worldwide. In this respect, the 2007–2008 US sub-prime financial crisis is hardly
exceptional.
Section VI shows that episodes of high inflation and currency debasement are just
as much a universal right of passage as serial default. Section VII introduces a composite
index that aggregates the “varieties of crises.” In the concluding section, we take up the
issue of how countries can graduate from the perennial problem of serial default. Will the
early 21st century prove different?
Appendix A gives a brief synopsis of how the database was constructed, while
Appendices I (macroeconomic series) and II (debt) list all the variables in the database and
provide their sources on a period-by-period and country-by-country basis.
II. First Insights: The Big Picture
What are some basic insights one gains from this panoramic view of the history of
financial crises? We begin by discussing sovereign default on external debt (i.e., a
government default on its own external debt or private sector debts that were publicly
guaranteed.)
The first observation is that for the world as a whole (or at least the more than 90
percent of global GDP represented by our dataset), the current period can be seen as a
typical lull that follows large global financial crises.
Figure 1 plots for the years 1800 to 2006 (where our dataset is most complete), the
percentage of all independent countries in a state of default or restructuring during any
given year. Aside from the current lull, one fact that jumps out from the figure are the
long periods where a high percentage of all countries are in a state of default or
restructuring. Indeed, there are five pronounced peaks or default cycles in the figure.
3

The first is during the Napoleonic War. The second runs from the 1820s through the late
1840s, when, at times, nearly half the countries in the world were in default (including all
of Latin America). The third episode begins in the early 1870s and lasts for two decades.

Notes: Sample size includes all countries, out of a total of sixty six listed in Table 1, that were independent
states in the given year.

The fourth episode begins in the Great Depression of the 1930s and extends through the
early 1950s, when again nearly half of all countries stood in default.3 The most recent
default cycle encompasses the emerging market debt crises of the 1980s and 1990s.
Indeed, when one weights countries by their share of global GDP, as in Figure 2
below, the current lull stands out even more against the preceding century. Only the two
decades before World War I—the halcyon days of the gold standard—exhibited tranquility

Kindleberger (1988) is among the few scholars who emphasize that the 1950s can be viewed as a financial
crisis era.

anywhere close to that of the 2003-to-2007 period.4 Looking forward, once cannot fail to
note that whereas one and two decade lulls in defaults are not at all uncommon, each lull
has invariably been followed by a new wave of default.
Figure 2 is interesting because it shows the years after World War II as marking the
peak of by far the largest default era in modern world history, with countries representing
almost 40 percent of global GDP in a state of default or rescheduling. This is partly a result
of new defaults produced by the war, but also due to the fact that many countries never
emerged from the defaults surrounding the Great Depression of the 1930s.5 By the same
token, the Napoleonic War defaults become as important as any other period. Outside
World War II, only the peak of the 1980s debt crisis nears the levels of the early 1800’s.
As we shall see when we tabulate individual country experiences in Section IV,
serial default on external debt—that is, repeated sovereign default—is the norm
throughout every region in the world, even including Asia and Europe.

4

This comparison weights defaulting countries by share of world income. On an unweighted basis (so, for
example, the poorest countries in Africa and South Asia receive the same weight as Brazil or the United
States), the late 1960s until 1982 had an even lower percentage of independent countries in default.
5
Kindleberger (1989) emphasizes the prevalence of default after World War II, though he does not provide
quantification.

Notes: Sample size includes all countries, out of a total of sixty six listed in Table 1, that were independent
states in the given year. Three sets of GDP weights are used, 1913 weights for the period 1800–1913, 1990
for the period 1914–1990, and finally 2003 weights for the period 1991–2006.

We have already seen from Figure 2 that global conflagration can be a huge factor
in generating waves of defaults. Our extensive new dataset also confirms the prevailing
view among economists that global economic factors, including commodity prices and
center country interest rates, play a major role in precipitating sovereign debt crises.6
We take up this issue in Section V. Making use of a range of real global commodity price
indices, we show that over the period 1800 to 2006, peaks and troughs in commodity price
cycles appear to be leading indicators of peaks and troughs in the capital flow cycle, with
troughs typically resulting in multiple defaults.

An even stronger regularity found in the literature on modern financial crises (e.g.,
Kaminsky and Reinhart, 1999 and Reinhart and Rogoff, 2008b) is that countries
experiencing sudden large capital inflows are at a high risk of having a debt crisis. The
preliminary evidence here suggests the same to be true over a much broader sweep of
history, with surges in capital inflows often preceding external debt crises at the country,
regional, and global level since 1800 if not before.
Also consonant with the modern theory of crises is the striking correlation between
freer capital mobility and the incidence of banking crises, as illustrated in Figure 3.
Periods of high international capital mobility have repeatedly produced international
banking crises, not only famously as they did in the 1990s, but historically. The figure
plots a three-year moving average of the share of all countries experiencing banking crises
on the right scale. On the left scale, we employ our favored index of capital mobility, due
to Obstfeld and Taylor (2003), updated and backcast using their same design principle, to
cover our full sample period. While the Obstfeld–Taylor index may have its limitations,
we feel it nevertheless provides a concise summary of complicated forces by emphasizing
de facto capital mobility based on actual flows.
The dating of banking crises episodes is discussed in detail in the Appendix. What
separates this study from previous efforts (that we are aware of) is that for so many
countries, our dating of crises extends back to far before the much-studied modern post–
World War II era; specifically we start in 1800. (See Table A.3 for details.) Our work was
greatly simplified back to 1880 by the careful study of Bordo, et al. (2001)—but for the
earlier period we had to resort to archeological work. The earliest advanced economy
banking crisis in our sample is Denmark in 1813; the two earliest ones we clock in
emerging markets are India, 1863 and Peru 10 years later.

Notes: As with external debt crises, sample size includes all countries, out of a total of sixty six listed in
Table 1 that were independent states in the given year. On the right scale, we updated our favorite index of
capital mobility, admittedly arbitrary, but a concise summary of complicated forces. The smooth red line
shows the judgmental index of the extent of capital mobility given by Obstfeld and Taylor (2003), backcast
from 1800 to 1859 using their same design principle.

(The aforementioned Peruvian case comes from a little-known 1957 book published in
Lima by Carlos Camprubi Alcazar entitled Historia de los Bancos en el Peru, 1860–1879.
There are many more such case studies in our references that were a vital source of
information on banking crises.)
As noted, our database includes long time series on domestic public debt.7
Because historical data on domestic debt is so difficult to come by, it has been ignored in
the empirical studies on debt and inflation in developing countries. Indeed, many generally
knowledgeable observers have argued that the recent shift by many emerging market

For most emerging market economies, over most of the time period considered, domestically issued debt
was in local currency and held principally by local residents. External debt, on the other hand, was typically
in foreign currency, and held by foreign residents.

8

governments from external to domestic bond issues is revolutionary and unprecedented.8
As we shall argue, nothing could be further from the truth, with implications for today’s
markets and for historical analyses of debt and inflation.
Until very recently, domestic debt was not on the radar screen of the multilateral
institutions. Neither the International Monetary Fund nor the World Bank systematically
collected such data. In fact, cross-country historical time series on domestically issued debt
are also absent from private data collections. Reinhart, Rogoff and Savastano (2003), with
extensive help from IMF staff and country sources, put together an annual series going
back to 1990 for a limited number of emerging market countries.9
The topic of domestic debt is so important, and the implications for existing
empirical studies on inflation and external default are so profound, that we have broken out
our data analysis into an independent companion piece (Reinhart and Rogoff, 2008). Here,
we focus on a few major points. The first is that contrary to much contemporary opinion,
domestic debt constituted an important part of government debt in most countries,
including emerging markets, over most of their existence. Figure 4 plots domestic debt as
a share of total public debt over 1900 to 2006.
For our entire sample of sixty-six countries, domestically issued debt averages more
than 50 percent of total debt for most of the period. (This figure is an unweighted average
of the individual country ratios.) Even for Latin America, the domestic debt share is
typically over 30 percent and has been at times over 50 percent.
Furthermore, contrary to the received wisdom, this data reveal that a very
important share of domestic debt—even in emerging markets— was long-term maturity

8

See the IMF Global Financial Stability Report, April 2007; many private investment-bank reports also
trumpet the rise of domestic debt as a harbinger of stability.

Since then, Jeanne and Guscina (2008) have extended them both back to 1980 and up to 2005.

(Reinhart and Rogoff 2008a). In that paper, we also present a variety of evidence to
support the view that, at the very least, domestic debt does not appear to be junior to
external debt, even factoring in a government’s ability to default via inflation.
As payments on domestic debt must come from the same revenue stream as
payments on foreign debt, the implication is that the extent of domestic debt can be quite
important in assessing the sustainability of a country’s external debt payments. Yet,
because it has not been possible to obtain extensive historical time series on domestic debt
until now, most empirical researchers have ignored the issue entirely. Reinhart and Rogoff
find that the same issue arises in the analysis of high inflation; most of the empirical
literature since Cagan’s classic (1956) paper has focused on the “seignorage” gains from
inflation, which are entirely levered off the real money base. Yet, the government’s gain
to unexpected inflation often derives at least as much from capital losses that are
inflicted on holders of long-term government bonds. Figure 5 on inflation and external
10

default (1900–2006) illustrates the striking correlation between the share of countries in
default on debt at one point and the number of countries experiencing high inflation (which
we define to be inflation over 20 percent per annum). Since World War II, inflation and
default have gone hand-in-hand.

Sources: For share of countries in default, see Figure 1; for high inflation episodes, see Appendix I.
Notes: Both the inflation and default probabilities are simple unweighted averages.

The forgotten history of domestic debt has important lessons for the present. As we
have already noted, most investment banks, not to mention official bodies such as the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, have argued that even though total
public debt remains quite high today (early 2008) in many emerging markets, the risk of
default on external debt has dropped dramatically, especially as the share of external debt
has fallen. This conclusion seems to be built on the faulty premise that countries will treat
domestic debt as junior, bullying domestics into accepting lower repayments or simply
11

defaulting via inflation. The historical record, however, suggests that a high ratio of
domestic to external debt in overall public debt is cold comfort to external debt holders.
Default probabilities probably depend much more on the overall level of debt. Reinhart
and Rogoff (2008b) discuss the interesting example of India, who in 1958 rescheduled its
foreign debts when it stood at only1/4 percent of revenues. The sums were so minor that
the event did not draw great attention in the Western press. The explanation, as it turns out,
is that India at this time had a significant claim on revenue from the service of domestic
debt (in effect the total debt-to revenue ratio was 4.4. To summarize, many investors
appear to be justifying still relatively low external debt credit spreads because “This time is
different” and emerging market governments are now relying more on domestic public
debt. If so, they are deeply mistaken.
Another noteworthy insight from the “panoramic view” is than that the median
duration of default spells in the post–World War II period is one-half the length of what
it was during 1800–1945 (3 years versus 6 years, as shown in Figure 6).
The charitable interpretation of this fact is that crisis resolution mechanisms have
improved since the bygone days of gun-boat diplomacy. After all, Newfoundland lost
nothing less than her sovereignty when it defaulted on its external debts in 1936 and
ultimately became a Canadian province; Egypt, among others, became British
“protectorates” following their defaults. A more cynical explanation points to the
possibility that, when bail-outs are facilitated by the likes of the International Monetary
Fund, creditors are willing to cut more slack to their serial-defaulting clients. The fact
remains that, as Bordo and Eichengreen (2001) observe, the number of years separating
default episodes in the more recent period is much lower. Once debt is restructured,

12

countries are quick to releverage (see Reinhart, Rogoff, and Savastano (2003) for empirical
evidence on this pattern).

Notes: The duration of a default spell is the number of years from the year of default to the year of
resolution, be it through restructuring, repayment, or debt forgiveness. The Kolmogorov–Smirnoff test for
comparing the equality of two distributions rejects the null hypothesis of equal distributions at the 1%
significance level.

III. A Global Database on Financial Crises with a Long-term View
In this section, we provide a slim outline of the character of the sample and the
building blocks of this database. Extensive detail is provided in three appendices.
Country coverage
Table 1 lists the sixty-six countries in our sample. Importantly, we include a large
number or Asian and African economies, whereas previous studies of the same era
typically included at most a couple of each. Overall, our dataset includes thirteen African

13

countries, twelve Asian countries, nineteen European countries, eighteen Latin American
countries, plus North America and Oceana.
As the final column in Table 1 illustrates, our sample of sixty-six countries indeed
accounts for about 90 percent of world GDP. Of course, many of these countries,
particularly those in Africa and Asia, have become independent nations only relatively
recently (column 2). These recently independent countries have not been exposed to the
risk of default for nearly as long as, say, the Latin American countries, and we will have to
calibrate our inter-country comparisons accordingly.10
Table 1 flags which countries in our sample may be considered default virgins, at
least in the narrow sense that they have never failed to meet their debt repayment or
rescheduled. One conspicuous grouping of countries includes the high-income
Anglophone nations, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. (The mother
country, England, defaulted in earlier eras as we shall see.) Also included are all of the
Scandinavian countries, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark. Also in Europe, there is
Belgium. In Asia, there is Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Korea.
Admittedly, the latter two countries, especially, managed to avoid default only through
massive International Monetary Fund loan packages during the last 1990s debt crisis and
otherwise suffered much of the same trauma as a typical defaulting country.
Also, of default-free countries, only Thailand existed as an independent state before
the end of World War II. For others, the potential opportunity for default has been
relatively short. Lastly, several of the sovereign default virgins, notably the United States,
qualify as such only because we are excluding events such as lowering the gold content of
10

Our sample excludes many of the world’s poorest countries, who by and large cannot borrow meaningful
amounts from private sector lenders, and who have virtually all effectively defaulted even on heavily
subsidized government-to-government loans. This is an interesting subject for another study, but here we are
mainly interested in financial flows that, at least in the first instance, had a substantial market element.

14

the currency in 1933, or the suspension of convertibility in the nineteenth-century Civil
War. Finally, there is one country from Africa, Mauritius, which has never defaulted or
restructured. It is notable that the non-defaulters, by and large, are all hugely successful
growth stories. This begs the question: Do high growth rates help avert default, or does
averting default beget high growth rates?
Table 1 also flags which countries in our sample have not defaulted on their
external debts, at least in the narrow sense that they have not outright failed to meet their
debt repayment on schedule in an important way on even one occasion. This is an issue we
will return to in Section IV.
Dates and Frequency of Coverage
Appendix A describes the data in detail, while Appendices I and II provide specifics
on coverage and sources on a country-by-country and period-by-period basis for all the
time series. All the data is annual—this includes the crises dates. Below we provide a list
of the variables used in this study.

Our debt data covers central government public debt—external and domestic. The
latter is decomposed into short-term and long-term debt in many, but not all, cases. For a
large number of countries the time series go back to the 1800s, if not earlier. However,
starting in 1913, the coverage for our sample becomes much more comprehensive. Debt is
perhaps the most novel feature of the dataset.

Prices
The data on prices is the most comprehensive in our set of variables, going back to
the early Middle Ages for Europe (including Turkey) and Asia. For the New World (the
United States and some of the larger Latin American countries), these data go back to the
1700s. Where possible, we use consumer prices (or cost-of-living) indices. On the basis of
this data, we construct the inflation series that allow us to date inflation crises.

17

Exchange rates
Exchange rates in this database come in two forms: For the pre-1600s period,
exchange rate data are constructed from the silver content of the currency, for which we
have data through the mid-1800s for 11 countries; beginning in the early 1600s, the Course
of the Exchange in Amsterdam established actual market-based exchange rates, marking
the beginning of modern exchange rates, for which we have a far more comprehensive
coverage. As in Reinhart and Rogoff (2004), we use market-based exchange rates, where
possible. These data underpin our dating of currency crashes.
Varieties of Crises: Banking, and external and domestic default
These time series are dichotomous variables that take on the value of one if it is a
crisis year and zero otherwise and are standard in the literature on crisis. Particulars of the
criteria used to define a banking crisis or an external or domestic default crisis are given in
Appendix A.
Government Finances, Trade, and GDP
Our dataset incorporates data on central government expenditures and revenues. On
the whole, these provide some of the most reliable data on country size and economic
strength in the era prior to development of conventional national income. Furthermore,
these data are available for many countries, including African countries (where data is
relatively scarce), throughout most of their colonial history.
The trade data (exports and imports) are next in reliability to the fiscal data. Like
their fiscal counterparts, these data offer longer history than the national accounts that are
of a relatively more modern vintage.
Having reasonably accurate output data is thus of enormous help in calibrating the
severity of crises. Unfortunately, GDP data for most countries prior to the twentieth
18

century are quite uneven. For many emerging markets, data are only available sporadically
and at long intervals, which is especially limiting in trying to assess the impact of crises.
Fortunately, we do have reliable estimates for a sufficient number of countries so as to be
able to draw broad conclusions and, of course, we can use government revenue and trade
data to supplement these estimates, as discussed in Appendix A.
The primary use of the revenue, exports, and GDP series in our analysis is to scale
debt, that is to construct the standard debt-to-revenues, etc., ratios.
Capital Flows
Pre–World War II gross capital flows are measured by data on debentures. Where
possible, we also reconstruct net flows by taking gross new issuance minus repayment,
taking into account partial defaults and negotiated interest rate reductions that often take
place during rescheduling episodes. For the post-war, we rely on the actual balance-ofpayments data, as reported by the multilateral institutions or the country sources.
Financial center data and global commodity prices
In modern times, emerging market financial crises have often been triggered by
events at the center, as Bulow and Rogoff (1990) and others have argued. To capture
developments in financial centers post-1800, we include: measures of short- and long-term
interest rates, real GDP, and current account balances. During most of the nineteenth
century, Britain was the global financial center. Since World War II, it has been the United
States, but both countries were influential during the long transition period from British to
U.S. financial hegemony.
Commodity prices have long been thought to be another important global driver of
the depression–prosperity cycles in modern times. Our historical dataset combines several
different indices of commodity prices, with the oldest dating back to 1790.

IV. Serial Default 1350–2006
When one looks carefully, virtually all countries have defaulted at least once and
many several times on external debt during their emerging market economy phase, a period
that typically takes at least one or two centuries.
Early Default, 1500 –1799
Today’s emerging markets can hardly claim credit for inventing serial default.
Table 2 lists the number of defaults, including default years, between 1300 and 1799 for a
number of now rich European countries (Austria, France, Germany, Portugal, and Spain).
As the table illustrates, today’s emerging market countries did not invent serial default.
Rather, a number of today’s now-wealthy countries, had similar problems when they were
“emerging markets.”

Sources: MacDonald (2006), Reinhart, Rogoff and Savastano (2003) and sources cited therein. The “*” for
England denotes our uncertainty at this time about whether its default was on domestic or external debt.

Spain’s defaults establish a record that remains as yet unbroken. Indeed, Spain
managed to default seven times in the nineteenth century alone, after having defaulted six
times in the preceding three centuries.

20

With its later string of nineteenth-century defaults, Spain took the mantle for most
defaults from France, which had abrogated its debt obligations on eight occasions between
1500 and 1800. Because the French monarchs had a habit of executing major domestic
creditors during external debt default episodes (an early form of “debt restructuring”), the
population came to refer to these episodes as “bloodletting.”11 The French Finance Minister
Abbe Terray, who served from 1768–1774, even opined that governments should default at
least once every 100 years in order to restore equilibrium (Winkler, p. 29).12
Remarkably, however, despite all the trauma the country experienced in the wake of
the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, France eventually managed to emerge
from its status of serial default. France did not default after 1812 in the nineteenth or
twentieth century nor (so far, anyway) in the twenty-first century. There is, however, some
debate as to whether France and others defaulted on a portion of their World War I debts to
the United States. 13 Austria and Portugal defaulted only once in the period up to 1800, but
then each defaulted a handful of times during the nineteenth century, as we shall see.
England, however, is perhaps an even earlier graduate. Edward III, of Britain,
defaulted on debt to Italian lenders in 1340 (see, for example, MacDonald, 2007), after a
failed invasion of France that set off the Hundred Years’ War. A century later, Henry VIII,
in addition to engaging in an epic debasement of the currency, seized all the Catholic
Church’s vast lands. While not strictly a bond default, such seizures, often accompanied by
executions, qualify as reneging on financial obligations.

11

See Reinhart, Rogoff and Savastano (2003) who thank Harald James for this observation.
One wonders if Thomas Jefferson read those words, in that he subsequently held that “the tree of liberty
must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.”

Sovereign Defaults, 1800–2006
Starting in the nineteenth century, the combination of the development of
international capital markets together with the emergence of a number of new nation states,
led to an explosion in international defaults. Table 3 lists nineteenth-century default and
rescheduling episodes in Africa, Europe and Latin America. We include debt
reschedulings, which the international finance theory literature rightly categorizes as
negotiated partial defaults (Bulow and Rogoff, 1989). We briefly digress to explain this
decision, which is fundamental to understanding many international debt crisis episodes.
Reschedulings constitute partial default for two reasons. The first reason, of course,
is that debt reschedulings often involve reducing interest rates, if not principle. Second,
and perhaps more importantly, international debt reschedulings typically saddle investors
with illiquid assets that may not pay off for decades. This illiquidity is a huge cost to
investors, forcing them to hold a risky asset, often with compensation far below market. It
is true that in some cases, investors that held defaulted sovereign debt for a sufficient
number of years—sometimes decades—have often yielded a return similar to investing in
relatively riskless financial center bonds (U.K. or later U.S.) over the same period. Indeed,
a number of papers have been written showing precisely such calculations (e.g., Mauro,
Sussman and Yaffa, 2006).
While interesting, it is important to underscore the fact that the right benchmark is
the return on high-risk illiquid assets, not highly liquid low-risk assets. It is no coincidence
that in the wake of the US sub-prime mortgage debt crisis of 2007, sub-prime debt sells at
steep discount relative to the expected value of future repayments. Investors rightly believe
that if they could pull out their money, they could earn a much higher return elsewhere in
the economy provided they are willing to take illiquid positions with substantial risk. And
22

of course they are right. Investing in risky illiquid assets is precisely how venture capital
and private equity, not to mention university endowments, have succeeded (until now) in
earning enormous returns. By contrast, debt reschedulings at negotiated below-market
interest rates give the creditor risk with none of the upside of say, a venture capital
investment. Thus the distinction between debt reschedulings—negotiated partial
defaults—and outright defaults (which typically end in partial repayment) is not a sharp
one.
Table 3 also lists each country’s year of independence. Most of Africa and Asia
was colonized during this period, allowing Latin America and Europe a substantial head
start. The only African countries to default during this period were Egypt (1876) and
Algeria (1867). Austria defaulted a remarkable 5 times, albeit not quite so prolific as
Spain.. Greece, which gained its independence only in 1829, made up for lost time by
defaulting four times. Default was similarly rampant throughout the Latin American
region, with Venezuela defaulting six times, and Costa Rica, Honduras, Colombia and the
Dominican Republic each defaulting four times.
Looking down the columns of Table 3 also gives us a first glimpse at the clustering
of defaults across regions and internationally. Note that a number of countries in Europe
defaulted during or just after the Napoleonic wars, while many countries in both Latin
America (plus their mother country Spain) defaulted during the 1820s. Most of these
defaults are associated with Latin America’s wars of independence. Although none of the
subsequent clusterings is quite so pronounced in terms of number of countries, there are
notable global default episodes during the late 1860s up to the mid-1870s, and again
starting in the mid-1880s through the early 1890s. We will later look at this clustering a bit
more systematically.

Next we turn to the twentieth century. Table 4 shows defaults in Africa and Asia,
including among the many newly colonized countries. Nigeria, despite its oil riches, has
defaulted a stunning five times since achieving independence in 1960, more than any other
country over the same period. Indonesia has also defaulted four times. Morocco, counting
its first default in 1903 during an earlier era of independence, also defaulted four times in
the twentieth century. India prides itself on escaping the 1990s Asian crisis (thanks to
massive capital controls and financial repression). In point of fact, it was forced to
reschedule its external debt three times since independence, albeit not since 1972. While
China did not default during its communist era, it did default on external debt in both 1921
and 1939.
Thus, as Table 4 illustrates, the notion that countries outside Latin American and
low-income Europe were the only ones to default during the twentieth century is an
exaggeration, to say the least.
Table 5 looks at Latin America and Europe, regions where, with only a few
exceptions, countries were independent throughout the entire twentieth century. Again, as
in the earlier tables, we see that country defaults tend to come in clusters, including
especially the period of the Great Depression, when much of the world went into default,
the 1980s debt crisis, and also the 1990s debt crisis. The latter crisis saw somewhat fewer
technical defaults thanks to massive intervention by the official community, particularly by
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Whether these massive
interventions were well advised is an entirely different issue that we will set aside here. In
Table 5, notable are Turkey’s five defaults, Ecuador and Peru’s six defaults, and Brazil’s
seven.
25

So far we have focused on number of defaults, but there is some arbitrariness to this
measure. Default episodes can be connected, particularly if debt restructuring terms are

harsh and make relapse into default almost inevitable. We have tried in Table 4 to exclude
obviously connected episodes, so that when a follow-on default occurs within two years of
an earlier one, we count it as one episode. However to gain further perspective into
countries default histories, we look next at the number of years each country has spent in
default since independence.

for each country, the year of independence, the total number of reschedulings (using our
measure) and the share of years since 1800 (or since independence, if more recent) spent in
a state of default or rescheduling. It is notable that, while there are many defaults in Asia,

the typical default was resolved relatively quickly. Only Indonesia, India, China and the
Philippines spent more than 10 percent of their independent lives in default (though of
course on a population-weighted basis, that is most of the region). Africa’s record is much
worse, with several countries spending roughly half their time in default. Certainly, one
main reason why African defaults are less celebrated than, say, Latin American defaults, is
because the debts of African countries have typically been relatively small, and the
systemic consequences less.
28

Table 7 gives the same set of statistics for Europe and Latin America. Greece, as
noted, spent more than half the years since 1800 in default. A number of Latin American
countries spent roughly 40 percent of their years in default, including Mexico, Peru,
Venezuela, Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, and Cost Rica.
One way of summarizing the data in Tables 6 and 7 is by looking at a time line
giving the number of countries in default or restructuring at any given time. We have
already done this in Figure 1 in section II. These figures, in which spikes represent a surge
in new borrowers, illustrate the clustering of defaults in an even more pronounced fashion
than our debt tables that mark first defaults.
The same is true across countries, although there is a great deal of variance,
depending especially on how long countries tend to stay in default (compare serial-debtor
Austria, which has tended to emerge form default relatively quickly, with Greece, which
has lived in a perpetual state of default). Overall, one can see that default episodes, while
recurrent, are far from continuous. This wide spacing no doubt reflects adjustments debtors
and creditors make in the wake of each default cycle. For example, today, many emerging
markets are following quite conservative macroeconomic policies. Over time, though, this
caution usually gives way to optimism and profligacy, but only after a long lull.

V. Global Cycles and External Defaults
As Kaminsky, Reinhart and Vegh (2004) have demonstrated for the post-war
period, and Aguirre and Gopinath (2007) have recently modeled, emerging market
borrowing tends to be extremely pro-cyclical. Favorable trends in countries’ terms of trade
(meaning typically, high prices for primary commodities) typically lead to a ramp-up of
borrowing that collapses into defaults when prices drop. The upper panel of Figure 7 is an
illustration of the commodity price cycle, which we split into two periods, the pre– and
post–World War II periods. As the figure broadly suggests for the period 1800 through
1940, (and as econometric testing corroborates), spikes in commodity prices are almost
invariably followed by waves of new sovereign defaults. The lower panel of Figure 7
calibrates the same phenomenon for the 1990s and 2000s. We note that while the
association does show through in the pre–World War II period, it is less compelling
subsequently.
As observed earlier, defaults are also quite sensitive to the global capital flow cycle.
When flows drop precipitously, more countries slip into default. Figure 8 documents this
association by plotting the current account balance of the financial center (the United
Kingdom and the United States) against the number of new defaults prior to the breakdown
of Bretton Woods. There is a marked visual correlation between peaks in the capital flow
cycle and new defaults on sovereign debt. The financial center current accounts capture
“global savings glut” pressures, as they give a net measure of excess center-country
savings, rather than the gross measure given by the capital flow series in our dataset.

Notes: New external defaults refer to the first year of default. Because of the marked negative downward drift
in commodity prices during the sample period, prices are regressed against a linear trend, so as to isolate the
cycle.

Notes: The current account for the UK and the US is defined according to the relative importance (albeit in a
simplistic arbitrary way) of these countries as the financial centers and primary suppliers of capital to the rest
of the world: 1800–1913 UK receives a weight of 1 (US, 0); 1914–1939 both countries’ current accounts are
equally weighted; post-1940, US receives a weight equal to 1.

We recognize that the correlations captured by these figures are merely illustrative,
and different default episodes involve many different factors. But aside from illustrating
the kind of insights one can get from such a long and broad dataset, the figures do bring
into sharp relief the vulnerabilities of emerging markets to global business cycles. The
problem is that crisis-prone countries, particularly serial defaulters, tend to over-borrow in
good times, leaving them vulnerable during the inevitable downturns. The pervasive view
that “this time is different” is precisely why it usually isn’t different, and catastrophe
eventually strikes again.
The capital flow cycle illustrated in Figure 8 comes out even more strikingly in
many individual country graphs, but we do not have space here to include these. An early

33

example, though, is illustrated in Figure 9, based on seventeenth-century Spain. The figure
illustrates how defaults often follow in the wake of large spikes in capital inflows.

Crises Emanating from the Center
We have already seen that major global spikes in defaults began in the 1820s, the
1870s, the 1930s and the 1980s. The 1930s spike was caused by the worldwide depression
that, by most accounts, began in the United States. So, too, did the 1980s spike, which was
caused by U.S. disinflation. What of earlier eras? Tables 8 and 9 give a thumbnail
summary of events, showing how the 1825 crisis began with a financial crisis in London
that spread to Europe, causing global trade and capital flows to plummet. This summary of
events, of course, is silent as to the magnitude of the international transmission channel, but
the tables are nevertheless illustrative of some of the common shocks that might have
sparked the commodity and capital flow cycles seen in the figures in the preceding

sections. Other examples where crises in the center lead to global financial crises include
the German and Austrian stock market collapse of 1873 (which has been studied by
Eichengreen in several contributions) and, of course, the Wall Street stock market crash of
1929. It is also notable that crises in the center do not always lead to full-blown global
financial crises, as illustrated by the Barings crisis of 1890 (where the repercussions were

35

mainly felt by Argentina and Uruguay), as well as by the US stock market crash and bank
runs of 1907, which transmitted mainly to Germany, France and Italy.
Domestic Debt
So far, we have focused on external debt crises, but not yet looked at domestic debt
buildups.
Some have argued that external defaults are less likely in the present period because
governments are now relying more on domestic debt. For example, in 2001 to 2005,
domestic government debt in Mexico and Colombia accounted for more than 50 percent of
total debt, as opposed to less than 20 percent in the early 1980s. But this is not new. In
1837, in the midst of one of Mexico’s longer default spells, domestic debt amounted to 64
percent of total public debt. The earliest year where our dataset has domestic debt statistics
for Colombia is 1923, when domestic debt accounted for 54 percent of total debt. During
the same year, domestic debt accounted for 52 percent of Brazil’s debt and 63 percent of
Peru’s debt. The 1920s, of course, was a period prior to the massive wave of external
defaults in the 1930s, a fact that ought to be looked at more closely by those who believe
that the recent shift by emerging markets towards domestic debt, and away from external
debt, somehow provides strong protection to creditors.
Figure 10 makes this point more systematically by examining the behavior of
domestic and external sovereign debt in the run-up to default. The bars give the average
experience of both types of debt, normalized by their levels four years prior to the credit
event. As can be seen, both components rise rapidly, at about the same rates, just before
default.

36

But domestic debt buildups often happen in the aftermath of external default,
precisely because countries have difficulty borrowing abroad. Figure 11 illustrates the case
of China, which had a massive run-up in domestic debt following its default of 1921.

Notes: For 1895–1915 the debt stock is calculated from domestic debentures data. According to Huang,
China did not have domestic debt prior to its 1895 domestic issue.

38

We have already acknowledged that domestic debt is not equivalent to foreign debt,
nor should it be treated as such. But we have also established that domestic debt has long
been fully as significant as external debt in meeting emerging market financing needs.
There is nothing “original” about it. And as we show in Reinhart and Rogoff (2008a),
defaults on domestic debt appear to be associated with similar magnitudes of output loss as
defaults on external debt.
VI. Default through inflation
If serial default is the norm for a country passing through the emerging market state
of development, then the tendency to lapse into periods of high and extremely high
inflation is an even more striking common denominator. No emerging market country in
history, including the United States (whose inflation rate exceeded 20 percent during the
country’s 1860s civil war) has managed to escape bouts of high inflation.
Of course, the problems of external default, domestic default and inflation are all
integrally related. A government that chooses to default on its debts can hardly be relied on
to preserve the value of its country’s currency. Money creation and interest costs on debt
all enter the government’s budget constraint and, in a funding crisis, a sovereign will
typically grab from any and all sources.
In this section, we give an overview of results from our annual cross-country
database on inflation going back to 13th-century Europe. We are only able here to give a
helicopter tour (so to speak) of our entire cross-country inflation dataset which, to our
knowledge, spans considerably more episodes of high inflation and across a broader range
of countries than any existing.
Although some writers seem to believe that inflation only really became a problem
with the advent of paper currency in the 1800s, students of the history of metal currency
39

will know that governments found ways to engineer inflation long before that. The main
device was through debasing the content of the coinage, either by mixing in cheaper
metals, or by shaving down coins and reissuing smaller coins in the same denomination.
Modern currency presses are just a more technologically advanced and more efficient
approach to achieving the same end.
Tables 9 and 10 give data on currency debasement across a broad range of
European countries during the pre–paper currency era, 1228–1799. The table illustrates
how strikingly successful monarchs were at implementing inflationary monetary policy.
Sweden achieved a debasement of 41 percent in a single year (1572), while the UK
achieved a 50 percent debasement in 1551; Turkey’s debasement was 44 percent in 1586.
The second column of the table looks at cumulative currency debasement over long
periods, often adding up to 50 percent or more. Table 10 looks at the same statistics for
European countries during the nineteenth century, where outliers include Austria’s 55
percent debasement in 1812, and Russia’s 57 percent in 1810, both in the aftermath of the
Napoleonic War. Turkey, in 1829, managed to reduce the silver content of its coins by 50
percent.
The pattern of sustained debasement emerges strikingly in Figure 12, which plots
the silver content of an equally weighted average of the European currencies in our early
sample (plus Russia and Turkey). “The March Toward Fiat Money” shows that modern
inflation is not as different as some might believe.

Inflation
However spectacular some of the coinage debasements reported in Tables 9 and 10,
there is no question that the advent of the printing press brought inflation up to a whole
new level. Figure 12 illustrates the median inflation rate for all the countries in our sample,
from 1500 to 2006 (taking a five-year moving average to smooth out cycle and
measurement error). The figure shows a clear inflationary bias throughout history
(although of course there are always periods of deflation due to business cycles, poor crops,
etc.). Starting in the twentieth century, however, inflation spikes radically.

Sources: There are innumerable sources given the length of the period covered and the large number of
countries included. These are listed in Table AI.

We look at country inflation data across the centuries in the next three tables. Table
11 gives data for the sixteenth through nineteenth century over a broad range of currencies.
What is stunning is that every country in both Asia and Europe experienced a significant
number of years with inflation over 20 percent during this era, and most experienced a
significant number of years with inflation over 40 percent. Take Korea, for example,
where our dataset begins in 1743. Korea experienced inflation of over 20 percent almost
half the time until 1800, and inflation over 40 percent almost one-third of the time.
Poland, where the data go back to 1704, has extremely similar ratios. Even the United
States experienced an episode of very high inflation, as inflation peaked at nearly 200
percent five percent in 1779. The New World colonies of Latin America experienced
frequent bouts of very high inflation long before the wars of independence from Spain.

Hyperinflation is defined here as an annual inflation rate of 500 percent or higher (this is not the traditional
Cagan definition).

Table 12 looks at the same years 1800–2006 as Table 11, but for thirteen African
countries and twelve Asian countries. South Africa, Hong Kong and Malaysia have notably
the best track records at resisting high inflation, albeit South Africa’s record extends back

45

to 1896, whereas Malaysia’s and Hong Kong’s only go back to 1949 and 1948
respectively.14

The dates in table 13 extend back prior to independence for many countries, including for example
Malaysia.

Most of the countries in Asia and Africa however, have experienced waves of high
and very high inflation. The notion that Asian countries have been immune from Latin
American–style high inflation is just as naïve as the notion that Asian countries were
immune from default crises up until the late 1990s Asian financial crisis. China
experienced over 1500 percent inflation in 194715, Indonesia over 900 percent in 1966.
Even the Asian tigers Singapore and Taiwan experienced inflation well over 20 percent in
the early 1970s.
Africa, perhaps not surprisingly, has a still worse record. Angola had inflation of
over 4,000 percent in 1996, and Zimbabwe of over 1,000 percent in 2006. Had we extended
the table through 2007, we would have picked up Zimbabwe’s 66,000 percent inflation for
2007, putting that country on track to surpass the Republic of the Congo (not included in
our sample), which has experienced three hyperinflations since 1970 (Reinhart and Rogoff,
2002).
Finally, Table 13 lists inflation for 1800 through 2006 for Europe, Latin America,
North America and Oceana. The European experiences include the great post-war
hyperinflations studied by Cagan (1956). But even setting aside the hyperinflations, we see
that countries such as Poland, Russia and Turkey experienced high inflation an
extraordinarily large percent of the time. Norway had 152 percent inflation in 1812,
Denmark 48 percent inflation in 1800, and Sweden 36 percent inflation in 1918. Latin
America’s post–World War II inflation history is famously spectacular, as the table
illustrates, with many episodes of peacetime hyperinflations in the 1980s and 1990s.

15

China, which invented the printing press well ahead of Europe, famously experienced paper-currencycreated high inflation episodes in the twelfth and thirteen centuries. (See for example, Fischer, Sahay and
Vegh, 2003) These episodes are in our database as well.

In all of Table 13, only New Zealand and Panama have no periods of inflation over
20 percent, although New Zealand’s inflation rate reached 17 percent as recently as 1980,
and Panama had 16 percent inflation in 1974.
As with debt defaults, the last few years have been a relatively quiescent period in
terms of very high inflation, although many countries (including Argentina, Venezuela and
of course Zimbabwe) still have very high inflation.16 Many observers, following the same
logic as in commenting on external default, have concluded that “this time is different.”
Perhaps, but, as with debt defaults, experience suggests that quiet periods do not extend
indefinitely.
Exchange rate crashes
Having discussed currency debasement and inflation crises, including at this late
stage a long expose on exchange rate crashes seems somewhat redundant. The database
on exchange rates is almost as rich as that on prices, especially if one takes into account
silver-based exchange rates, and is described in detail in the Appendices. In this lengthy
sample inflation crises and exchange rate crises travel hand- in- hand in the
overwhelming majority of episodes across time and countries (with a markedly tighter
link in chronic- inflation countries).
Instead, as regards exchange rate behavior, probably the most surprising evidence
comes from the Napoleonic Wars, during which exchange rate instability escalated to a
level that had not been seen before and was not to be seen again for nearly one hundred
years. This is starkly illustrated in Figures 14 and 15, with the former depicting the
incidence of high inflation and the latter showing median inflation. The significantly higher

16

At the time of this writing the “official” inflation rate in Argentina is 8 percent—informed estimates place
it at 26 percent.

49

incidence of crashes and larger median changes in the more modern period are hardly a
surprise.

VII. Varieties of Crises
We deal with five “varieties” of economic crises: external default, domestic
default, banking crises, currency crashes, and inflation outbursts.17 All these variables take
on the value of one when there is a crisis and zero otherwise. Thus, in a tranquil year the
tally across crises for that particular country would total zero, while in the worst-case
scenario (Argentina 2002, for instance) it would sum to five. Hence, each country has an
entry each year in the 0 to 5 range. We next take simple averages across all countries, or
across countries in a particular region, and thus construct a composite index of financial
instability that is multidimensional.
These are the time series shown for the full sample in Figure 16 for the whole
sample and for Asia. We have comparable figures for all the other regions. We selected
Asia to highlight a point we have made earlier on more than one occasion. Namely, that
the 1997–1998 crisis was not the first and that the region had several protracted bouts of
economic instability by international standards of the day.
VIII. Conclusions
This paper offers a detailed quantitative overview of the history of financial crises
dating from the mid-fourteenth century default of Edward III of England to the present subprime crisis in the United States. Our study is based on a comprehensive new statistical
dataset compiled by the authors that covers every region of the world and spans several
centuries.
Inevitably, a database of this scale and scope, involving so many primary and
secondary historical sources (that do not always agree), will contain some errors and
omissions, despite our best efforts. We welcome suggestions for corrections, additions,
17

The total would come to 6 if we include currency debasement—but for this there is far less data across
countries, as discussed.

51

and improvements of this database, which we will attempt to incorporate into the online
version, with appropriate attribution and cross-referencing.

Notes: We deal with five “varieties” of economic crises (external default, domestic default, banking crises,
currency crashes, and inflation outbursts), and all these variables take on the value of one when there is a
crisis and zero otherwise. Thus, in a tranquil year the tally across crises for that particular country would total
zero, while in the worst-case scenario (Argentina 2002, for instance) it would sum to five. Hence, each
country has an entry each year in the 0–5 range. We next take simple averages across all countries or across
countries in a particular region and these are the time series shown above.

Our principle aim here has been to illustrate some core features of this sweeping
database, trying to bring out a few fundamental regularities. We are fully aware that, in
such a broad synthesis, we are inevitably obscuring important nuances surrounding
historically diverse episodes.
With these caveats in mind, this “panoramic” quantitative overview has revealed a
number of important facts. First and foremost, we illustrate the near universality of
52

episodes of serial default and high inflation in emerging markets, extending to Asia, Africa,
and until not so long ago, Europe. We show that global debt crises have often radiated from
the center through commodity prices, capital flows, interest rates, and shocks to investor
confidence. We also show that the popular notion that today’s emerging markets are
breaking new ground in their extensive reliance on domestic debt markets, is hardly new.
This brings us to our central theme—the “this time is different syndrome.” There is
a view today that both countries and creditors have learned from their mistakes. Thanks to
better-informed macroeconomic policies and more discriminating lending practices, it is
argued, the world is not likely to again see a major wave of defaults. Indeed, an often-cited
reason these days why “this time it’s different” for the emerging markets is that
governments there are relying more on domestic debt financing.
Such celebration may be premature. Capital flow/default cycles have been around
since at least 1800—if not before. Technology has changed, the height of humans has
changed, and fashions have changed. Yet the ability of governments and investors to
delude themselves, giving rise to periodic bouts of euphoria that usually end in tears, seems
to have remained a constant. As Kindelberger wisely titled the first chapter of his classic
book “Financial Crisis: A Hardy Perennial.”
On a more positive note, our paper at least raises the question of how a country
might “graduate” from a history of serial default. Although the case of seventeenth-century
England has been much studied, it appears to be exceptional. It is not clear how well the
institutional innovations noted by North and Weingast (1996) would have fared had Britain
been a bit less fortunate in the many wars it fought in subsequent years. For example, had
Napoleon not invaded Russia and France prevailed in the Napoleonic War, would Britain
really have honored its debts.
53

Interesting recent cases include Greece and Spain, countries that appear to have
escaped a severe history of serial default not only by reforming institutions, but by
benefiting from the anchor of the European Union. Austria, too, managed to emerge from
an extraordinarily checkered bankruptcy history by closer integration with post-war
Germany, a process that began even before European integration began to accelerate in the
1980s and 1990s. In Latin America, Chile has seemingly emerged from serial default
despite extraordinary debt pressures through the simple expedient of running large and
sustained current account surpluses. These surpluses allowed the country to pay down its
external debt to an extremely low level. True graduation, of course, would mean that Chile
could start raising its debt levels if needed (say, to benefit from countercyclical fiscal
policy) without quickly slipping back into problems.
Mexico is an interesting case where, despite profound failure to engage in deep
institutional reform, the country stands on the verge of graduation thanks to a combination
of better monetary and fiscal policy, as well as the North American Free Trade Agreement.
It is an interesting question whether, through deeper economic integration, the United
States can offer the same pull to Latin countries as the European Union has done in its early
days. Of course, if history tells us anything, it is that we cannot jump to “this time is
different” conclusions. In particular, concluding that countries like Hungary and Greece
will never default again because “this time is different due to the European Union” may
prove a very short-lived truism.

Appendix: A Global Database with a Long-term View: Sources and Methodology

This appendix presents a broad-brush description of the comprehensive database used in
this study and evaluates its main sources, strengths, and limitations. Since the theme of this work is
that the devil lurks in the details, further documentation on the coverage and numerous sources for
individual time series by country and by period is provided in Data Appendices I and II. Those are
devoted to the macroeconomic time series used and the public debt data (which is the centerpiece of
our analysis), respectively.
The remainder of this appendix is organized as follows: The first section describes the
compilation of the family of time series that are brought together from different major and usually
well-known sources. These series include prices, modern exchange rates (and earlier metal-based
ones), real GDP, and exports. For the recent period, the data are primarily found in standard largescale databases. For earlier history, we relied on individual scholars or groups of scholars—more
details to follow. Next, we describe the data that is more heterogeneous in both its sources and
methodologies. These are series on government finances, and individual efforts to construct
national accounts—notably nominal and real GDP, particularly pre-1900. The remaining two
sections are devoted to describing the particulars of building a cross-country, multi-century
database on public debt and its characteristics and the various manifestations and measurements of
economic crises. Those include domestic and external debt defaults, inflation and banking crises,
and currency crashes and debasements. The construction of the public domestic and external debt
database can be best described as more akin to archeology than economics. The compilation of

67

crises episodes encompasses both mechanical rules of thumb to date a crisis as well as arbitrary
judgment calls on the interpretation of historical events as described by the financial press and
scholars over the centuries.
I. Prices, Exchange Rates, Currency Debasement, and Real GDP
1. Prices
Since an overarching theme of our analysis is to document the incidence and magnitude of
various forms of expropriation or default through the ages, no such study would be complete
without taking stock of expropriation through inflation. Following the rise of fiat currency,
inflation became the modern-day version of currency debasement. To that end, our preferred
measures are consumer price indices or their close relative, cost-of-living indices (as those
constructed by Williamson et al. in several “regional” papers).18 Our data sources for the modern
period are primarily the standard databases of the International Monetary Fund—International
Financial Statistics (IFS) and World Economic Outlook (WEO). For pre–World War II coverage
(usually from the early 1900s or late 1800s), Global Financial Data (GFD) and Williamson et al.,
and the Oxford Latin American History Database (OXLAD, http://oxlad.qeh.ox.ac.uk/) are key
sources.
Since our analysis spans several earlier centuries, we rely on the meticulous work of a number
of economic historians who have constructed such price indices item by item, most often by city
rather than by country, from primary sources. In this regard, the scholars participating in the Global
Price and Income History Group project at the University of California, Davis
(http://gpih.ucdavis.edu/) and their counterparts at the Dutch International Institute of Social
History (http://www.iisg.nl/hpw/ ) have been an invaluable source for prices is Europe and Asia. 19
The complete references by author to this body of scholarly work are given in Appendix I and in
the references. For colonial America, the Historical Statistics of the United States (HSUS ,

18

These regional papers provided time series for numerous developing countries for the mid-1800s to pre–
WWII.
19
While our analysis of inflation crises begins in 1500, many of the price series begin much earlier.

68

http://hsus.cambridge.org) recently updated the U.S. data, while Richard Gardner (Economic
History Data Desk: Economic History of Latin America, the United States and the New World,
1500–1900, at http://home.comcast.net/~richardgarner04/) covers key cities in Latin America.
On methodology
When more than one index is available for a country, we work with the simple average. This is
most useful when there are price series for more than one city for the same country, such as in the
pre-1800s data. When no such consumer price indices are available, we turn to wholesale or
producer prices indices (as, for example, China in the 1800s and the U.S. in the 1720s). Absent any
composite index, we fill in the holes in coverage with individual commodity prices. This almost
always takes the form of wheat prices for Europe and rice prices for Asia. We realize that a single
commodity (even if it is the most important one) is a relative price, rather than the aggregate we
seek, so if on any given year we have at least one consumer (or cost-of-living) price series and the
price of wheat (or rice)—we do not average the two but give full weight to the composite price
index. Finally, from 1980 to the present the WEO data dominates all other sources, as it enforces
uniformity—although for the recent period discrepancies across these price indices is, at most,
trivial.
2. Exchange rates, modern and early, and currency debasement
The handmaiden to inflation is, of course, currency depreciation. For post–World War II
data, our primary sources for exchange rates are IFS for official rates and Pick’s Currency
Yearbooks for market-based rates, as quantified and documented in detail in Reinhart and Rogoff
(2004). For modern pre-war rates GFD, OXLAD, HSUS, and the League of Nations Annual
Reports are the primary sources. These are sometimes supplemented with scholarly sources for
individual countries, as described in Appendix I. Less modern are the exchange rates for the
late1600s–early1800s for a handful of European currencies, which are taken from John Castaing's
Course of Exchange, which appeared twice a week (on Tuesdays and Fridays) from 1698

69

throughout the following century or so (see European State Finance Data Base, ESFDB,
http://www.le.ac.uk/hi/bon/ESFDB/frameset.html.)
The earlier “silver-based” exchange rates were calculated by these authors (trivially) from
the time series provided primarily by Robert Allen (for other sources see Appendix I, Table AI.4,
which lists individual authors), who constructed continuous annual series on the silver content of
several European currencies).20 The earliest series begin in the mid-13th century for Italy and
England. As we describe in this appendix, these series are the foundation for dating and
quantifying the “debasement crises”—the precursors of modern devaluations.
3. Real GDP
To maintain homogeneity, inasmuch as possible for our large sample of countries over the
course of approximately 200 years, we employ as a primary source Angus Maddison’s data,
spanning 1820–2003 (depending on the country), and its updated version through 2006 by the Total
Economy Database (TED http://www.ggdc.net/). GDP is calculated on the basis of PPP 1990
International Geary–Khamis dollars. TED contains, among other things, series on levels of real
GDP, population, and GDP per capita, for up to 125 countries from 1950 to the present. These
countries represent about 96 percent of the world population. As the smaller and poorer countries
are not in the database, the sample represents an even larger share of world GDP (99 percent). We
do not attempt to include in our study aggregate measures of real economic activity prior to 1800.21
To calculate a country’s share of world GDP continuously over the years, we sometimes
found it necessary to interpolate the Maddison data. For most countries, GDP is reported only for
selected benchmark years (1820, 1850, 1870, etc.). Interpolation took three forms, ranging from the
best or preferred practice to the most rudimentary. When we had actual data for real GDP (from
either official sources or other scholars) for periods for which the Maddison data is missing and
periods for which both series are available, we ran auxiliary regressions of the Maddison GDP

There are exceptions. For instance, Rodney Edvinsson’s careful estimates for Sweden 1720–2000 or

HSUS for the US beginning in 1790 offer a basis on which to examine earlier economic cycles and
their relation to crises.

70

series on the available GDP series for that particular country. This allowed us to fill in the gaps for
the Maddison data, thus maintaining cross-country comparability and enabling us to aggregate GDP
by region or worldwide. When no other measures of GDP were available to fill in the gaps, the
auxiliary regressions linked the Maddison measure of GDP to other indicators of economic activity,
such as an output index or, most often, central government revenues—for which we have long
continuous time series. 22 As a last resort, if no potential regressors were available, interpolation
simply connected the dots of the missing Maddison data assuming a constant annual growth rate in
between the reported benchmark years. While this method of interpolation is, of course, useless
from the vantage point of discerning any cyclical pattern, it still provides a reasonable measure of a
particular country’s share of world GDP, as this share usually does not change drastically from year
to year.
4. Exports
Though subject to chronic misinvoicing problems,23 the external accounts are most often
available for longer periods. Misinvoicing not withstanding, those accounts can be considered
more reliable than many other series of economic activity. The series used in this study are taken
from the IMF, while the earlier data come primarily from GFD and OXLAD. Official historical
statistics and assorted academic studies listed in Data Appendix I complement the main databases.
Trade balances provide a rough measure of the country-specific capital flow cycle—particularly for
the earlier periods when data on capital account balances are nonexistent. Exports are also used to
scale debt—particularly external debt.
II. Government Finances and National Accounts
1. Public finances
Government finances are primarily taken from Mitchell for the pre-1963 period and from
Kaminsky, Reinhart, and Végh (2004) and sources cited therein for the more recent period. The
22

It is well known that revenues are intimately linked to the economic cycle.
See, for example, calculations in the background material to Reinhart and Rogoff (2004),
http://www.publicpolicy.umd.edu/faculty/reinhart/PartII_Dual.pdf.

23

71

web pages of the central banks and finance ministries of the many countries in our sample provide
the most up-to-date data. For many of the countries in our sample, particularly in Asia and Africa,
the time series on central government revenues and expenditures date back to the colonial period.
Details on individual country coverage are presented in Appendix Table AI.7. In nearly all cases,
the Mitchell data goes back to the 1800s, enabling us to calculate debt-to-revenue ratios for many of
the earlier crises.
Richard Bonney’s European State Finance Data Base (ESFDB), which brings together the
data provided by many authors is an excellent source for the larger European countries for the pre1800 era, as it offers considerable detail on government revenues and expenditures, not to mention
extensive bibliographical references.
2. National Accounts
Besides the standard sources, such as the IMF, United Nations, and World Bank, which
provide data on national accounts for the post–World War II period (with different starting points
depending on the country), we consult other multicountry databases such as OXLAD for earlier
periods. As with other time series used in this study, the constructed national account series
(usually for pre–World War I) from many scholars around the world, such as Brahmananda for
India, Baptista for Venezuela, and Yousef for Egypt, are incorporated into our collection.

III. Public Debt and its Composition
One would think that with at least 250 sovereign external default episodes during 1800–
2007 and at least 70 cases of default on domestic public debt (not to mention the significant
economic disruption associated with these events), it would be relatively straightforward to find a
comprehensive long time series on public sector debt.24 Yet, this is not the case—far from it.
Government debt is among the most elusive of economic time series.

24

These numbers are a lower bound, since they do not include the many sovereign defaults prior to 1800 and,
as regards domestic defaults, we have only begun to skim the surface, see Reinhart and Rogoff (2008).

72

For the advanced economies, the most comprehensive data comes from the OECD, which
provides time series on general government debt since 1980. However, this data has several
important limitations: it only includes a handful of emerging markets; for many advanced
economies (France, Finland, Greece, and the U.K., to name a few), the data actually begins much
later in the 1990s, which cannot be considered as much of a time series; and only total debt is
reported, with no particulars provided of the composition of debt (domestic versus foreign) or its
maturity (long-term versus short-term). To state that the IMF’s well-known World Economic
Outlook (WEO) database extends to public debt requires a stretch of the imagination.25 Data is only
provided for the G-7 from 1980 onward (out of 180 countries covered in the WEO).
The most comprehensive data on public debt comes from the World Bank’s Global
Development Finance (GFD, known previously as the World Debt Tables). It is an improvement
on the other databases in that it begins (for most countries) in 1970 and it provides extensive detail
on the particulars of external debt. Yet, GFD also has serious limitations. There are no advanced
economies included in the database (nor newly-industrialized countries (such as Israel, Korea, or
Singapore, for that matter) to facilitate comparisons. Unlike data from the IMF and the World
Bank for exchange rates, prices, government finances, etc., there is no data prior to 1970. Last, but
certainly not least, these data only cover external debt. In a few countries, such as Panama or Côte
D’Ivoire, external debt is a sufficient statistic on government liabilities, since domestic public debt
levels are relatively trivial. As Reinhart and Rogoff (2008) illustrate, however, for most countries
domestic debt accounts for an important share of total government debt. The all-country average
oscillates between 40 to 80 percent during 1900–2006.26
In search of the elusive data on total public debt, we examined the archives of the global
institutions’ predecessor, the League of Nations, and found that this institution collected
information on, among other things, public domestic and external debt in its Statistical Yearbook
25

This description comes from the IMF’s web site: “Download time series data for GDP growth, inflation,
unemployment, payments balances, exports, imports, external debt, capital flows, commodity prices, more.”
26
For some countries, such as the Netherlands, Singapore, and the United States, practically all public debt is
domestic.

73

(1926–1944). While, neither the IMF nor the World Bank continued this practice after the war, the
newly-formed United Nations (UN) inherited the data collected by the League of Nations and in
1948 its Department of Economic Affairs, published a special volume on public debt, spanning
1914–1946. From that time onwards the UN continued to collect and publish the domestic and
external debt data in the same format as their pre-war predecessor on an annual basis in their
Statistical Yearbooks. As former colonies became independent nations, the database expanded
accordingly. This practice continued until 1983, at which time the domestic and external public
debt series were discontinued altogether. In total, these sources yield time series that span 1914–
1983 for the most complete cases. It covers advanced and developing economies. For the most
part, it also disaggregated domestic debt into its long-term and short-term components. To the best
of our knowledge, this data is not available electronically in any database, hence it required going
to the original publications. This data provides the starting point for our public debt series, which
have been (where possible) extended to the period prior to 1914 and post-1983.
For data prior to 1914 (including several countries that were then colonies)27, we consulted
numerous sources, both country-specific statistical and government agencies and individual
scholars. Data Appendix II provides details or the sources by country and time period. When no
public debt data is available prior to 1914, we proceed to approximate the foreign debt stock by
reconstructing debt from individual international debt issues. This debenture data also provide a
proximate measure of gross international capital inflows. Much of the data come from scholars
including Lindert and Morton, Marichal, Miller, and Wynne, among others. From these data, we
construct a foreign debt series (but, not total debt).28 This exercise allows us to examine standard
debt ratios for default episodes for several newly-independent nations in Latin America as well as
Greece and important defaults such as that of China in 1921, and Egypt and Turkey in the 1860s–
1870s. These data are most useful for filling holes in the external debt time series, when countries

the colonial period.

74

first tap international capital markets. Their usefulness (as measures of debt) is acutely affected by
repeated defaults, write-offs, and debt restructurings that introduce disconnects between the
amounts of debt issued and the subsequent debt stock.29
For some countries (or colonies in the earlier period) where we have only relatively recent
data for total public debt, but have reliable data going much further back on central government
revenues and expenditures, we calculate and cumulate fiscal deficits to provide a rough
approximation to the debt stock.30
To update the data for post-1983, we mostly rely on GFD for external debt. Two very
valuable recent studies facilitate the update: Jeanne and Guscina (2006) compile detailed date on
the composition of domestic and external debt for 19 important emerging markets for 1980–2005;
Cowan, Levy-Yeyati, Panizza, Sturzenegger (2006) perform a similar exercise for all the
developing countries of the Western hemisphere for 1980–2004. Last, but certainly not least, are
the official government sources themselves, which are increasingly forthcoming in providing
domestic debt data, often under the IMF’s 1996 initiative, Special Data Dissemination Standard.
IV. Global variables
Global variables (for lack of a better name, since this term is of fairly recent vintage) have
two components: those indicators that are, indeed, global in scope—namely, world commodity
prices, and country-specific key economic and financial indicators for the world’s financial centers
during 1800–2007. For commodity prices, we have time series since the late 1700s from four
different sources (see Data Appendix I). The key economic indicators include the current account
deficit, real and nominal GDP, and short- and long-term interest rates for the relevant financial
center of the time (i.e., the U.K. prior to World War I and the U.S, subsequently).
V. Varieties of Economic Crises and their Dates

29

Even under these circumstances, they continue to be a useful measure of gross capital inflows, as there was
relatively little private external borrowing nor bank lending in the earlier sample.
30
Indonesia prior to 1972 is a good example where this exercise was particularly useful.

75

To identify crisis episodes, we used two approaches, one is quantitative in nature while the
other is based on a chronology of events. This approach is similar to that followed in Kaminsky
and Reinhart (1999), who used quantitative thresholds to date currency crises and events to date
banking crises. Details follow.
1. Crises defined by quantitative thresholds: currency crashes, debasement, and inflation
Inflation crises
Since we want to study the incidence of expropriation in its various forms, we are not only
interested in dating the beginning of an inflation or currency crisis episode but its duration as well.
Many of the high-inflation spells can be best described as chronic—lasting many years. In our
earlier work (Reinhart and Rogoff, 2004), which classified exchange rate arrangements for the
post–World War II period, we used a 12-month inflation threshold of 40 or higher percent to define
a “freely falling” episode. In this study, which spans a much longer period before the widespread
creation of fiat currency, inflation rates well below 40 percent per annum were considered as
inflation crises. Thus, we adopt an inflation threshold of 20 percent per annum. Median inflation
rates before World War I were well below those of the more recent period: 0.5 for 1500–1799;
0.71 for 1800–1913; and 5.0 for 1914–2006. Furthermore, as the last column of Table A1
highlights, hyperinflations are of modern vintage, with Hungary 1946 holding the record in our
sample.
Currency crashes
To date currency crashes, we follow a variant of Frankel and Rose (1996), who focus
exclusively on the exchange rate depreciation. This definition is the most parsimonious, as it does
not rely on other variables such as reserve losses and interest rate hikes. Mirroring our treatment of
inflation episodes, we are not only concerned here with the dating of the initial crash (as in Frankel
and Rose, 1996 and Kaminsky and Reinhart, 1999) but with the full period in which annual
depreciations exceed the threshold. Hardly surprising, the largest crashes shown in Table A1 are

76

similar in timing and orders of magnitudes as the inflation profile. The “honor” of the record
currency crash, however, goes to Greece in 1944.

The most extreme episode in our
sample is the 1948 Chinese

Currency debasement
The predecessor of modern inflation and foreign exchange rate crises was currency
debasement during the long era when the principal means of exchange were metallic coins.
Debasements were particularly frequent and large during wars. Indeed, drastic reductions in the
silver content of the currency provided many sovereigns with their most important source of
financing. Figure A1, which depicts the track record for Russia and Austria during the Napolenic
Wars, is indeed representative of many more episodes.
Finally, we also date currency “reforms” or conversions and their magnitudes. Such
conversions form a part of every hyperinflation episode in our sample, in effect, it is not unusual to
have several conversions in quick succession. For example, in its struggle with hyperinflation,
Brazil had no less than four conversions from 1986 to1994. However, when it comes to the
magnitude of a single conversion, the record holder is China in 1948, with a conversion rate of
three-million to one. Conversions also follow spells of high (but not necessarily hyper inflation),
and these cases are also included in our list of modern debasements.

The same quantitative methodology could be applied to date the burst of asset price bubbles
(equity or real estate) that are so commonplace in the run-up to banking crises, but we do not
encompass such episodes in this study and leave it for future research.31
2. Crises defined by events: banking crises and domestic and external debt defaults
In this section, we describe the criteria used in this study to date banking crises, external
debt crises, and their little known or understood domestic debt crises counterparts.
Banking Crises
With regard to banking crises, our analysis stresses events. The main reason for following
this approach has to do with the lack of long time series data that allows us to date banking or

31

See Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) for the construction of thresholds to date equity price crashes and
Reinhart and Rogoff (2008) for a depiction of the behavior of real estate prices on the eve of banking crises in
industrialized economies.

79

financial crises quantitatively along the lines of inflation or currency crashes. For example, the
relative price of bank stocks (or financial institutions relative to the market) would be a logical
indicator to examine. However, this is problematic, particularly for the earlier part of our sample as
well as for developing countries (where many domestic banks do not have publicly traded equity).
If the beginning of a banking crisis is marked by bank runs and withdrawals, then changes
in bank deposits could be used to date the crises. This indicator would have certainly done well in
dating the numerous banking panics of the 1800s. Often, however, the banking problems do not
arise from the liability side, but from a protracted deterioration in asset quality, be it from a collapse
in real estate prices or increased bankruptcies in the nonfinancial sector. In this case, a large
increase in bankruptcies or nonperforming loans could be used to mark the onset of the crisis.
Indicators of business failures and nonperforming loans are also usually available sporadically, if at
all; the latter are also made less informative by banks’ desire to hide their problems for as long as
possible.
Given these data limitations, we mark a banking crisis by two types of events: (1) bank runs
that lead to the closure, merging, or takeover by the public sector of one or more financial
institutions (as in Venezuela in 1993 or Argentina in 2001); and (2) if there are no runs, the closure,
merging, takeover, or large-scale government assistance of an important financial institution (or
group of institutions), that marks the start of a string of similar outcomes for other financial
institutions (as in Thailand 1996–97). We rely on existing studies of banking crises and on the
financial press; according to these studies the fragility of the banking sector was widespread during
these periods.
Many country-specific studies (such as Camprubi, 1957, for Peru; Cheng, 2003, and
McElderry, 1976, for China; and Noel, 2002, for Mexico) pick up banking crisis episodes not
covered by the multicountry literature and contribute importantly to this chronology, but the main
sources for cross-country dating of crises are as follows: For post-1970, the comprehensive and
well-known study by Caprio and Klingebiel—which the authors updated through 2003—is

80

authoritative, especially when it comes to classifying banking crises into systemic or more benign
categories; Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999), and Jacome (2008) for Latin America round out the
sources. For pre–World War II, Kindleberger (1989), Bordo et al. (2001), and Willis (1926)
provide multicountry coverage on banking crises.
We relegate a summary discussion of the limitations of this event-based dating approach to
Table A2, while the years in which the banking crises began are listed in Table A3—unfortunately,
for many of the early episodes it is difficult to ascertain how long the crisis lasted.

Definition and/or Criteria

Comments

We mark a banking crisis by two types
of events: (1) bank runs that lead to the
closure, merging, or takeover by the
public sector of one or more financial
institutions; and (2) if there are no runs,
the closure, merging, takeover, or
large-scale government assistance of an
important financial institution (or group
of institutions), that marks the start of a
string of similar outcomes for other
financial institutions.
A sovereign default is defined as the
failure to meet a principal or interest
payment on the due date (or within the
specified grace period). The episodes
also include instances where
rescheduled debt is ultimately
extinguished in terms less favorable
than the original obligation.
The definition given above for external
debt applies. In addition, domestic debt
crises have involved the freezing of
bank deposits and or forcible
conversions of such deposits from
dollars to local currency.

This approach to dating the beginning of a
banking crisis is not without drawbacks. It
could date a crisis too late, because the
financial problems usually begin well before
a bank is finally closed or merged; it could
also date a crisis too early, because the worst
part of a crisis may come later. Unlike the
external debt crises (see below), which have
well-defined closure dates, it is often difficult
or impossible to accurately pinpoint the year
in which a crisis ended.
While the time of default is accurately
classified as a crisis year there are a large
number of cases where the final resolution
with the creditors (if it ever did take place)
seems interminable. Fort his reason we also
work with a crisis dummy that only picks up
the first year.
There is at best some partial documentation
of recent defaults on domestic debt provided
by Standard and Poors. Historically, it is very
difficult to date these episodes and in many
cases (like banking crises) it is impossible to
ascertain the date of the final resolution.

81

External Debt Crises
External debt crises involve outright default on payment of external debt obligations
(Argentina 2001 holds the record for the largest default), repudiation (as in Mexico 1867, when an
over 100 million pesos of debt, issued by Maximillian, was repudiated by the Juarez government),
or the restructuring of debt into terms less favorable to the lender than those in the original contract
(for instance, India’s little-known external restructurings in 1958–1972.
These events have received considerable attention in the academic literature from leading
modern-day economic historians, such as Michael Bordo, Barry Eichengreen, Marc Flandreau,
Lindert and Morton, and Alan Taylor.32 Relative to early banking crises (not to mention domestic
debt crises—which have been all but ignored in the literature) much is known about the causes and
consequences of these rather dramatic episodes. The dates of sovereign defaults and restructurings
are those listed in Tables 2–5. For post-1824, the dates come from several Standard and Poors
studies. However, these are incomplete, missing numerous post-war restructurings and early
defaults so this source has been supplemented with additional information from Lindert and Morton
(1989), MacDonald (2003), Purcell and Kaufman (1993), Suter (1992), and Tomz (2007). Of
course, required reading in this field includes Winkler (1933) and Wynne (1951).
Methodology
While the time of default is accurately classified as a crisis year there are a large number of
cases where the final resolution with the creditors (if it ever did take place) seems interminable.
Russia’s default following the revolution holds the record, lasting 69 years. Greece’s default in
1826 shut it out from international capital markets for 53 consecutive years, while Honduras’s 1873
default had a comparable duration.33 Looking at the full default episode is, of course, useful for
characterizing the borrowing/default cycles, calculating hazard rates, etc. But it is hardly credible
that a spell of 53 years could be considered a crisis—even if they weren’t exactly prosperous years.
Thus, in addition to constructing the country-specific dummy variables to cover the entire episode,
32
33

This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of the scholars that have worked on historical sovereign defaults.
At present, Honduras remains in default since 1981, 27 years.

82

we also employ two other qualitative variables. The first of these only enters as a crisis the year of
default; while the second creates a seven-year window centered on the default date. The rationale is
that neither the three years that precede a default nor the three years that follow it can be considered
a “normal” or “tranquil” period. As in Reinhart and Rogoff (2008), this allows us to analyze the
behavior of various economic and financial indicators surrounding the crisis.
Domestic Debt Crises
Information on domestic debt crises is scarce but it is not because these crises do not take
place. Indeed, as Reinhart and Rogoff (2008) show, domestic debt crises typically take place
against much worse economic conditions than the average external default. Usually domestic debt
crises do not involve external creditors, perhaps this may help explain why so many episodes go
unnoticed. Of course, this is not always the case, Mexico’s much-publicized near-default in 1994–
1995 would have been a “famous” domestic default crisis indeed, since the dollar-linked
government debt, the Tesebonos, that were on the verge of default, were issued under domestic law
and were part of domestic debt. One can only speculate that if the Tesobonos had not been so
widely held by nonresidents, perhaps this crisis would have received less attention. Since 1980,
Argentina has defaulted three times on its domestic debt—the two defaults that coincided with
defaults in external debt (1982 and 2001) did attract considerable international attention. The largescale 1989 default that did not involve a new default on external debt and did not involve
nonresidents is scarcely known in the literature. Even the many defaults on domestic debt during
the Great Depression in advanced economies and developing ones are not well documented.
Another feature that characterizes domestic defaults is that references to arrears or
suspension of payments on domestic debt are often relegated to footnotes. Lastly, some of the
domestic defaults that involved the forcible conversion of foreign currency deposits into local
currency have occurred during banking crises, hyperinflations, or a combination of the two
(Bolivia, Peru, and Argentina are in this list).

83

The approach toward constructing categorical variables follows that previously described
for external debt default. Like banking crises and unlike external debt defaults, for many episodes
of domestic default the endpoint for the crisis is not well known.
