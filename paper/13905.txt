JEL No. C1,D1,J1,O10
ABSTRACT
This paper is the first systematic attempt to measure the existence and degree of dowry inflation in
South Asia. The popular press and scholarly literature have assumed dowry inflation in South Asia
for some time, and there are now a number of theoretical papers that have attempted to explain the
rise of dowries in South Asia. Despite these advances, there has been no systematic study of dowry
inflation. Using large-sample retrospective survey data from India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal,
we assess the empirical evidence for dowry infllation. We find no evidence that real dowry amounts
have systematically increased over time in South Asia.

Introduction

In a typical South Asian marriage, the bride’s family transfers a large sum— up to several multiples
of annual household income— to the groom’s family. In the latter half of the twentieth century,
observers began to document what appeared to be a general phenomenon: that dowry amounts
were precipitously rising over time. In recent years, the existence of "dowry in‡ation" over the
course of the twentieth century has come to represent a stylized fact about marriage in South Asia.
To take two recent examples, the International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences devotes a section
on the entry for dowries to the phenomena of "dowry in‡ation" in South Asia and notes that "India
witnessed a real in‡ation in dowries in the latter half of the twentieth century" (Maitra 2007, p.
5). Also, a recent survey article of the economics of dowry and brideprice devotes a section to the
phenomenon of dowry in‡ation in South Asia (Anderson 2007a).1 More broadly, dowry in‡ation
has become a de…ning theme within discussions of the welfare of women in developing countries.
Activists and policy-makers have arrayed around the issue, many arguing that the secular rise in
dowries in South Asia has exacerbated sex-selective abortion, female infanticide, and other forms
of gender-speci…c maltreatment due to the impending shock to consumption that accompanies the
birth of a daughter.
For social scientists accustomed to thinking about marriage as a market, dowry in‡ation represents a puzzle: how could real dowry amounts rise precipitously in the face of South Asia’s declining
female-to-male sex ratios?

If dowry is essentially a price that equilibrates the marriage market

(Becker 1981), declining sex ratios should force dowry amounts downward. A classic demographic
explanation, …rst applied in the South Asian context by Epstein (1973) and Caldwell (1982, 1983),
and statistically tested by Rao (1993a), holds that a "marriage squeeze" may account for dowry
in‡ation. The general idea is that a persistent gap in the male-to-female age at marriage combined
with population growth and infant mortality declines drives a perpetual (and increasing) scarcity
of grooms. More recently, a series of papers have adopted a dynamic marriage market accounting
framework to assess the theoretical validity of a marriage squeeze explanation of rising dowries
(Anderson (2007b), Neelakantan and Tertilt (2007), Maitra (2006a, 2006b)). Dowry in‡ation has

relatively small number of interviews and Paul (1986), who used a non-random sample.

also captured the imagination of scholars in pursuit of even deeper puzzles. Anderson (2003), for
example, asks why modernity wrought the decline of dowry elsewhere around the world, but not in
South Asia. Finally, a number of studies address the economic implications of dowry in‡ation on
other phenomena such as human capital investment in daughters (e.g., Dasgupta and Mukherjee
(2003)).
Especially in light of the popular and scholarly interest in the phenomenon of dowry in‡ation,
the empirical evidence for rising real dowries is thin. Early scholarly accounts of dowry in‡ation
drew from small samples in particular regions of South Asia (Epstein 1973, Billing 1991, 1992). The
…rst statistical evidence for dowry in‡ation was o¤ered by Rao (1993a, 1993b). In a replication,
Edlund (2000) and Rao (2000) were unable to support the marriage squeeze explanation for dowry
in‡ation. The stylized fact of dowry in‡ation, however, remained unchallenged.
Unfortunately, empirical evidence of dowry in‡ation is lacking, and since Rao’s initial foray
there have been only a handful of studies that deal with estimates of dowry in‡ation. The empirical
evidence is mixed. Edlund (2000) replicates Rao’s Indian results and …nds no evidence of dowry
in‡ation or for the marriage squeeze hypothesis, but Rao (2000) contends that the latter is because
he and Edlund use di¤erent estimates of the sex ratio.

Dalmia and Lawrence (2005) …nd no

association between the marriage squeeze (the average age of marriage adjusted sex ratio) and
dowry amounts, and …nd evidence of dowry de‡ation over time.

Edlund (2006) says that the

problem may be the de…nition of dowry. She distinguishes between gross dowry (all the assets a
bride brings with herself into marriage) and net dowry (the value of bride assets minus any groom
payments), and …nds little evidence for net dowry in‡ation. Shenk (2005) …nds that while marriage
costs (ceremonies and gifts, for example) have increased, other elements of dowry do not exhibit
dowry in‡ation. While this existing empirical evidence goes against the conventional wisdom that
real dowries are rising over time, the small sample sizes, use of only one data source, and the lack
of geographic diversity are weakness that prevent these studies from establishing a general trend.
Similarly, the existing evidence looks for dowry in‡ation in multivariate statistical models that
attempt to estimate a dowry function that maps bride and groom characteristics into a dowry. As
such, the empirical evidence on dowry in‡ation is always contained in an analysis of the dowry
function itself.
Evidence of dowry in‡ation from dowry function estimates present a number of problems for
2

the detection and measurement of dowry in‡ation.

First, if an observation of dowry in a given

year does not contain other relevant variables in the dowry function– such as husband’s or wife’s
education–it is omitted from the statistical model. Therefore, only if these other relevant variables
are missing at random will the estimates of dowry in‡ation be unbiased. Second, the discussion
(and estimation) of dowry in‡ation does not require one to estimate a dowry function.

The

question of dowry in‡ation is not the prevalence of dowry or characteristics of those participating
in the dowry system (where modeling an explicit dowry function is necessary), but whether real
dowries have been rising over time more than prices in general. This point is related to the …rst,
but distinct–if no dowry in‡ation is found in correlations of real dowry and year of marriage, then
any dowry in‡ation that appears in estimates of dowry functions is due to the fact that missing
values of other variables in the dowry function are not missing at random with respect to dowry
and year of marriage. This would imply that dowry in‡ation arising from dowry functions are a
…gment of the data–the results of missing variables being correlated with year of marriage and/or
dowry amounts.

Third, a more systematic approach to the problem will help establish whether

dowries have been rising in South Asia generally or if they have been rising only in particular areas.
As the claims about dowry in‡ation have been quite general (Anderson 2007a), evidence from a
number of di¤erent sources is necessary to establish the general pattern.
In this paper we ask the following question: Is there any evidence of dowry in‡ation in South
Asia?

To answer this question, we adopt a straightforward measure of dowry in‡ation: the

correlation of year of marriage with dowry. In contrast with attempts to measure dowry in‡ation
by regressing dowry amounts on year of marriage and characteristics of the bride and groom (Rao
1993b, Deolalikar and Rao 1998, Dalmia 2004), we think the correlation more properly addresses the
simple question of whether dowries have actually risen over time. In estimating the correlation we
do not exclude responses with missing values for other variables, make no use of a dowry function,
and take a systematic approach to the topic by looking at survey evidence from India, Pakistan,
Bangladesh, and Nepal. By keeping our estimation strategy simple, we are able to utilize the most
data possible to address the question of interest.
First, we de‡ate nominal dowries using rice prices to create real dowry values. Using rice prices
to de‡ate nominal values has been the preferred method for estimating real values in developing
countries as price indices may not re‡ect household budgets or consumption choices (see Deaton
3

2006 and Banerjee and Du‡o 2007). Rice prices are closely tied to the well-being of the general
population and well-correlated with existing price indices. Second, we use …ve surveys of South
Asian households (International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics [ICRISAT] and
Survey of Women and the Family [SWAF] from India, the Pakistan Integrated Household Survey
[PIHS], the Nepal Living Standards Survey [NLSS], and the Matlab Health and Socioeconomic
Survey [MHSS] from Bangladesh), to look for evidence of dowry in‡ation in a number of di¤erent
sources covering the majority of South Asia. To our knowledge, these are the only widely available
sources that can be used to measure dowry in‡ation in South Asia. We then estimate the correlation
of nominal and real dowry with year of marriage, and test the hypothesis that year of marriage and
real dowry are positively correlated.
We …nd no evidence of dowry in‡ation in any of our sources.

In fact, the only statistically

signi…cant results we do …nd indicate that real dowries have fallen over time.

Furthermore, in

surveys that allow us to distinguish dowries by type we …nd no evidence of dowry in‡ation by
type of dowry transfer. Our …ndings complement and expand recent papers which test for dowry
in‡ation. The existing scholarship which attempts to measure dowry in‡ation continues to do so
within the con…nes of a dowry function (Edlund (2006), Dalmia and Lawrence (2005))–our simple
empirical approach is closer to the central question of the existence of dowry in‡ation. Similarly, our
…ndings are the only …ndings to extend beyond India to cover other South Asian countries, which
is especially important since claims of dowry in‡ation have been attributed to the subcontinent.
Although claims of dowry in‡ation are quite popular in the press and public imagination, we …nd
no evidence of systematic dowry in‡ation in South Asia.

2.1

Real Dowries and the Dowry, Year-of-Marriage Relationship
Calculating Real Dowries

Retrospective dowry information is always collected in nominal terms (a standard prompt in a
survey would be "How much in dowry was paid at the time of your marriage?"), yet claims of
dowry in‡ation hinge on real dowries rising quickly over time. The issue is how to de‡ate dowries,
so that dowry increases or decreases over time re‡ect general increases in the real (time invariant

4

value) dowry. While one approach would be to de‡ate dowries using standard government price
indices, these approaches have a number of problems.

First, as Deaton (2006) and others have

noted, aggregate price indices may have little relation to the economic lives of the average citizen in
a poor country, precisely because they purchase relatively few of their goods in the market (Du‡o
and Banergee 2007).

Since families spend a large portion of their resources on food, and since

many households are still primarily involved in agriculture, some have advocated that agricultural
prices should be used to de‡ate nominal amounts, as they are closer to actual living standards than
aggregate price indices.

Using agricultural prices, which show less in‡ation than general prices,

actually biases our results in favor of …nding dowry in‡ation since the de‡ation is less than we
would …nd using traditional price indices.2
To de‡ate nominal dowry amounts, we follow Khan and Hossain (1989), and Amin and Cain
(1998) in using rice prices. No single source contains rice prices for the entire period for which
we have reports of nominal dowry, so we constructed a series using the Statistical Abstracts for
British India for the period 1910-1946; the Pakistan Central Statistical O¢ ce’s Statistical Yearbook
1955 for 1949; the Pakistan Central Statistical O¢ ce’s 20 Years of Pakistan in Statistics for 19501967; and the Statistical Yearbooks of Bangladesh for 1965-1996. Duplicate observations for the
years 1964 to 1967 were used to convert between takas and rupees, and overlapping medium and
common rice prices for the years 1950 to 1967 are used to convert between rice qualities. We used a
linear interpolation to cover the missing years (1947-1948). Real dowries are expressed in (medium
quality) rice kilograms for all real dowry amounts reported here. Given the strong correlation of
our rice price series and the government’s estimates of price increases for each of the countries we
consider (see appendix), we take this price series as one that corresponds roughly to the region as
a whole, and use this same series for all countries.3

2.2

Measuring the Dowry, Year-of-Marriage Correlation

We use three approaches to capture the dowry, year-of-marriage relationship. The …rst approach is
the simple ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression of real dowry on year of marriage. Since
this is a simple regression we capture the basic correlation between dowry and year of marriage
2

The correlation of our price series with the aggregate comsumer and overall price index is quite strong (see
appendix).

Naturally, given the high correlation with the published CPI, results with traditional price indices are the same.

So the simple regression of real dowries on year of marriage gives us not only the estimate of
the linear relationship, but the square of the Pearson correlation coe¢ cient as well.

6

There are a number of problems with the Pearson correlation, however. One problem is that
Pearson correlations assume that the relationship between the variables is linear. A second problem
is that ordinal values of variables are not dealt with well in the methodology unless the relationship
is linear. A third problem is that the correlation estimate is sensitive to the presence of outliers,
as are OLS regression coe¢ cients.

Spearman’s and Kendall’s correlations are non-parametric

correlation methods that overcome many of these problems, and they also allow us to gauge the
robustness of our results. In both Spearman’s and Kendall’s correlations the data are converted
from their numerical values to an ordinal ranking (in our case, the year of marriage and real dowry
amount).

In practice, the data are sorted on one variable (say, year of marriage) and then the

ranking of the other variable (real dowry), relative to the ranking of the …rst variable form the basis
of the Spearman and Kendall measures.

In both cases, correlations of the rankings (low/high

ranking of year of marriage corresponding to low/high rankings of real dowry) imply a relationship,
but unlike Pearson’s correlation the relationship is not required to be linear, only monotonically
increasing (a much weaker restriction) and the measure is not sensitive to the presence of outliers
since values are converted to an ordinal ranking.
The Spearman’s correlation coe¢ cient is

=1

P
6 i d2i
n (n2 1)

(6)

where di is the di¤erence between the actual and predicted rank of real dowry by year of
marriage. For example, for the earliest marriage (rank = 1) we would expect the real dowry to
be the lowest value as well (rank = 1); if not, the di¤erence between the two would be non-zero,
lowering our estimate of the correlation. Standard errors of the correlation are calculated as having
a student t distribution under the null hypothesis of no correlation

(7)

This is used to construct con…dence intervals around the correlation estimate and for hypothesis

Kendall’s correlation also measures the relationship between two rankings. If we let C denote
the number of concordant pairs (where the ranks of the two variables agree with one another) and
D denote the number of discordant pairs, the general (uncorrected) Kendall correlation is given by

the correlation measure, like the Spearman’s correlation, makes no correction for ties, which
can sometimes result is underestimates depending on the di¤erent number of ordinal rankings for
one variable than another (this is particularly important in our case since we have multiple real
dowry observations for the same year of marriage). In this case, a re…nement of the Kendall rank

which can be used to test the null hypothesis of no correlation between the two measures.4
In the following section we use these three methods to uncover the empirical relationship between
real dowries and year of marriage in …ve surveys from South Asia. One point should be stressed

Under the null hypothesis of no correlation the variances of

about our methodology. First, because we are only concerned about the real dowry and year of
marriage relationship it could well hold that any correlation we …nd is due to omitted variable bias.
Therefore, if we …nd no relationship between dowry and year of marriage in the simple correlation
we are even less likely to …nd it in models of dowry that include these omitted variables such as
the sex ratio in the marriage market.

The same argument applies if dowry amount and year of

marriage are measured with errors that are correlated with one another (for example, those who
married long ago may be hazy on the year and/or dowry amount). In both instances one is more
likely to …nd a higher correlation of real dowry with year of marriage than in more fully speci…ed
models.

Empirical Evidence of Dowry In‡ation

3.1

Evidence from ICRISAT (India)

We begin by looking at the data from the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid
Tropics (ICRISAT) 1975 household and agriculture survey and the 1983 retrospective marriage
survey. This dataset was …rst assembled along with demographic data from the Census of India by
Vijayendra Rao. As the …rst dataset to contain dowry amounts in India, the ICRISAT data was
used in Rao (1993a,b); Deolalikar and Rao (1998) to probe the determinants of dowry in‡ation. In
fact, Rao’s papers remain the only published references claiming evidence of dowry in‡ation using
randomly-sampled data on dowry amounts. Subsequent to publication, a comment by Lena Edlund
(2000) challenged the robustness of the evidence for a marriage squeeze driving dowry in‡ation.5
We follow the suggestion of Edlund and report the net dowry (transfers from bride net of transfers
to bride) and year of marriage correlation. We further expand the size of the sample by looking only
at the relationship between real dowry and the year of marriage, not the dowry function estimated
by Edlund.

Regression results are reported in Table 1.

In using both net dowry and real net

dowry we …nd no statistically signi…cant evidence of dowry in‡ation.

More importantly, what

movement that exists is substantively small, and the result holds when we control for caste using
landholding status. The growth rate of dowry amounts (from regressions of log dowry amount on
5

The key issue was the statistical signi…cance of the coe¢ cient on age-adjusted sex ratio when dowry amounts
were regressed on a number of bride and groom characteristics. Neither the comment nor the reply (Rao, 2000) asked
whether the ICRISAT data indeed displayed dowry in‡ation.

9

year of marriage) is under 1% in all speci…cations.6 In those same villages, the growth rate of real
income was around 1.5% for the period 1975-1984 and although the data before this period cannot
be linked to the ICRISAT villages, most studies …nd a growth rate of around 1% in most parts of
India before 1975 (Kurosaki, 2000). Even when looking only at the marriages of daughters, where
parents would potentially have greater recall about dowry amounts transferred, the results show
little relationship between the year of marriage and the real or nominal dowry amount.
Table 2 reports the Spearman correlations of dowry with year of marriage. The correlation of
real dowry with time is slight, only .08, and not statistically di¤erent from zero in any measure.
Table 2 also reports the Kendall correlations of dowry with year of marriage, and once again
the relationship is very slight.

Even after correcting for ties in the correlation, the correlation

coe¢ cient for nominal dowries is only .06, and not statistically di¤erent from zero, and for real
dowries it is negative.

In both cases, looking only at the daughter’s marriages shows that the

correlation between real dowry and year of marriage is negative, although this correlation is not
statistically di¤erent from zero either.
Why did Rao …nd dowry in‡ation in the ICRISAT when we …nd none? Although we were
not able to replicate his …nding exactly, perhaps the answer lies in the observations dropped as
“missing”.

As is (unfortunately) customary in the literature, Rao drops observations for which

there are missing data in any variable of interest. The problem, of course, is that these are not
missing at random. The bulk of these are observations are those for whom wife height is missing.
For the whole sample (n=168), the Pearson correlation for net dowry is .1089 (.1601 standard error),
while the sample for women who have height observations (n=132) is .1435 (.1006 standard error).
Although the average year of marriage is the same as that of the complete sample, this subsample of
deleted “missings” re‡ect a negative relationship between net dowry and year of marriage, leaving
Rao with a sample that appears to show evidence of dowry in‡ation.

3.2

Evidence from The Survey of Women and the Family (India)

The Survey of Women and the Family (SWAF) for India, conducted in 1993 and 1994, contains
a sample of over 1,800 women from 28 villages in four regions of India.
6

A key strength of the

When regressing the log net real dowry amounts on year of marriage the coe¢ cient on year of marriage is negative
(-.09) and not statistically signi…cant at the 10% level.

10

SWAF data is that dowries are disaggregated into cash and non-cash components (such as land,
cows, etc.).

A disadvantage of the SWAF data is that it does not give us speci…c values for the

dowries, but it gives us …ve ordinal categories that the nominal dowries fall into. For this reason we
cannot perform regression analysis or compute Pearson correlations with this data. While we can
still see if the average real dowry moves between categories over time, the raw data being ordinal
puts limits on the number of categories by design, and therefore may weaken any correlation that
may exist if it is not enough to shift the ordinal categories in the survey.

A real problem here

is that since these are ordinal categories we cannot de‡ate the dowry amounts, and therefore any
correlation we do …nd may not be correlation of real dowry and year of marriage but nominal dowry
and year of marriage.

Because of these weaknesses, we view the evidence coming from SWAF as

secondary rather than primary since the raw dowry amounts are not in the data. Nevertheless,
we do calculate the Spearman and Kendall correlations of dowry by type of dowry (we distinguish
between land, jewelry, and cash dowries) and year of marriage.
Table 3 gives the Spearman correlations between dowry and year of marriage by dowry type in
the SWAF dataset. As the table shows, the land and jewelry dowries do not correlate signi…cantly
with time, and dowries of land transfer appear to be negatively correlated to year of marriage. Cash
dowries, however, do seem to increase with year of marriage in a statistically signi…cant way. We
should expect some increase in nominal cash dowries over time, however, owing to nominal in‡ation
generally. Table 3 also shows the Kendall correlations for the same relationships, and the pattern
of the Spearman correlations holds.

The problem with this evidence is in the interpretation–

without actual dowries amounts it is impossible to attribute this correlation to dowry in‡ation and
overall price increases (general in‡ation). What we can say is that, relative to increases in jewelry
and land dowries, cash dowries appear to increase with time. This distinction by type of dowry is
important in so far as the type of dowry transfer may itself tell us about the changing function of
dowry over time. For example, Arunachlam and Logan (2006) disaggregate dowries into regimes,
and they …nd that dowries that function as bequest are more likely to contain non-cash elements
as opposed to dowries that function as prices.

While we make no claims about the function of

dowry here, disaggregation may give us clues to where tales of dowry in‡ation arise from. To the
extent that the conclusions of Arunachalam and Logan hold, the increases in nominal cash dowries
in the SWAF data may re‡ect the changing function of dowry, but without the actual amounts we
11

cannot draw inferences on dowry in‡ation itself. Overall, the evidence from both ICRISAT and
SWAF give us little evidence that real dowries have been rising over time in India.

3.3

Evidence from the Pakistan Integrated Household Survey

The Pakistan Integrated Household Survey (PIHS) was conducted jointly by the Federal Bureau of
Statistics (FBS), Government of Pakistan, and the World Bank in 1991. The purpose of the survey
was to provide individual, household, and community level data to analyze the impact of policies on
living standards of households. It contains information on housing conditions, education, health,
employment, self-employment activities, consumption, migration, fertility, credit and savings, and
household energy consumption and covers both urban and rural areas in all four provinces (Punjab,
Sindh, NWFP, and Balochistan). The PIHS sample comprised 4,800 households drawn from 300
Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) throughout the country.
A strength of the PIHS data is that, like the SWAF for India, dowry is disaggregated by types
(land and non-land).

Unlike the SWAF, however, the PHIS records the nominal values of the

disaggregated dowry amounts, allowing us to analyze the dowry in‡ation by type in Pakistan.
Table 4 shows the OLS regressions for real and nominal dowries by dowry type.

Both nominal

total dowries and non-land dowries show little correlation with year of marriage, but both values do
have large (but not statistically signi…cant) regression coe¢ cients, as we would expect for nominal
values.

Real dowries (both total and non-land) are negatively correlated with year of marriage.

The Pearson correlation is -.22 for total real dowries and -.44 for real non-land dowries. Table 4
also gives the log dowry relationships. Both log total and log non-land dowries grow at 2.2% per
year, but the correlation with year of marriage is slight (.10). Real dowries decline at more than
4% per year, but in log terms the Pearson correlations for both types of dowries are nearly identical
(-.20 and -.22 respectively).
Table 5 shows the Spearman correlations for dowries.

While nominal dowries and real land

dowries are positively correlated with time, real total dowries and real non-land dowries are negatively correlated with time.

None of the Spearman correlations is statistically distinguishable

from zero, however, so the conclusion from the Spearman correlation is that there is no correlation
between dowry and year of marriage, either in real or nominal terms. The Kendall correlations in
Table 5 give the same pattern as the Spearman correlations. All nominal dowries are positively
12

correlated with year of marriage, as are real land dowries, while the non-land dowries are negatively
correlated with time, although none of the dowries exhibit statistically signi…cant correlation. The
evidence from real non-land dowries here comes from actual values, and as such we can say that
non-land dowries have not exhibited any more in‡ation than land dowries.

Similarly, the in‡a-

tion of cash dowries witnessed in the SWAF seems to be consistent with the nominal results from
Pakistan.

3.4

Evidence from the Matlab Health and Socio-Economic Survey (Bangladesh)

We estimate the model using data from 1996 Matlab Health and Socioeconomic Survey (MHSS) in
rural Bangladesh. We have 5328 marriages in this dataset in which year of marriage is reported (or
can be constructed from age and age at marriage). Of these, 1735 women report a positive dowry
at the time of marriage. In 581 marriages, the husband con…rmed that a dowry was given, and in
134 marriages, a husband reported a dowry even when the wife did not. This gives a total of 1869
marriages in which dowry was reported. Of these, in 1706 marriages the wife reports the dowry
amount (includes the value of goods at the time of marriage). In addition, we have 663 marriages
in which the husband reports the dowry amount but the wife does not. In 556 marriages we have
two reports of dowry; for the results that follow, we take the average of the reports. All results are
qualitatively similar when we exclude husbands’dowry reports.
Table 6 shows the OLS regressions for nominal and real dowries and year of marriage from the
Matlab data. The nominal dowries do increase over time, but real dowries actually decrease over
time, and both relationships are statistically signi…cant, although neither is strongly correlated with
year of marriage (.26 for nominal dowry, -.33 for real dowries). To better gauge the relationship,
columns 3 and 4 look at the log of nominal and real dowries, and the coe¢ cients can be interpreted
as the percent increase or decrease in their values over time. Nominal dowries grow at 6.2% per
year, and the Pearson correlation between year of marriage and log nominal dowries is .48. Real
dowries decrease by 2.7% per year, and their Pearson correlation with time is only -.22.

This

evidence supports the notion that dowries in Bangladesh have actually de‡ated over time.
Spearman correlations for both real and nominal dowries are shown in Table 7. The correlations
follow the pattern from the OLS regressions, and both of the correlations are statistically signi…cant.
While nominal dowries are positively correlated with time real dowries are negatively correlated
13

with time. Kendall correlations reported in Table 7 attenuate the size of the correlation coe¢ cients
relative to the Spearman values, but the qualitative implications remain the same. Real dowries
show evidence of statistically signi…cant de‡ation over time in Bangladesh.

Evidence from the Nepal Living Standards Survey

The Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) was conducted jointly by the Central Bureau of Statistics
(CBS), Government of Nepal, and the World Bank in 1995 to gather information at the household
level on population, housing, education, agricultural activity, consumption and other socio-economic
characteristics to aid in formulating more e¤ective development policies and programs. More than
3,000 households were chosen from four strata based on geographical and ecological regions in the
country, with the primary sampling unit being a ward.

The survey covers 275 wards with 12

households per ward (16 in the far western region). The sample represents 73 of the 75 districts in
Nepal.
Table 8 shows the OLS regressions for nominal and real dowries and year of marriage from the
Nepalese data.

Nominal dowries do increase over time, but real dowries actually decrease over

time, and while the nominal dowry increases are statistically signi…cant, the real dowry decreases
are not statistically signi…cant. Beyond this di¤erence is the statistical strength of the relationship,
neither real or nominal dowries are highly correlated with year of marriage (.20 for nominal dowry,
.00 for real dowries).

Columns 3 and 4 of Table 8 look at the log of nominal and real dowries,

which measures the percent increase or decrease in dowries over time. Nominal dowries grow at
5.8% per year, and the Pearson correlation between year of marriage and log nominal dowries is
.36. Real dowries decrease by 1.2% per year, and their Pearson correlation with time is only -.1.
While the growth of nominal dowries is statistically signi…cant, for real dowries the relationship is
indistinguishable from zero.
Spearman correlations for both real and nominal dowries are shown in Table 9. The correlations di¤er from the pattern from the OLS regressions; the nominal dowry correlation is positive
and statistically signi…cant while the real dowry correlation coe¢ cient is weakly positive but not
distinguishable from zero. In this instance both nominal and real dowries are positively correlated
with year of marriage. Kendall correlations reported in Table 9 attenuate the size of the correlation coe¢ cients relative to the Spearman values, but the qualitative implications remain the same.

Real dowries show evidence of weak, but statistically insigni…cant, de‡ation over time in Nepal.

Conclusions and Implications

From a scholarly perspective,dowry in‡ation has spurred a ‡owering of sharp thinking about the
economics and sociology of dowry and marriage payments more broadly. In this sense, whether
dowry in‡ation exists or not is somewhat beside the point, as the theory and empirical tools that
have been developed to address the issue are of broad utility to social scientists. From a practical
and policy-making perspective, however, the question of the existence of dowry in‡ation is critical.
Using basic statistical techniques, we fail to corroborate the widespread claim that real dowry
amounts have risen substantially in South Asia.
There are caveats to our approach, however, which temper the urge to view our results as the
de…nitive end of the idea of dowry in‡ation. First, there was a transition in the second half of the
twentieth century where marriage transfers in South Asia moved from being bride prices to dowries
(Epstein 1973, Billing 1991, 1992).

As we do not have evidence on bride prices we cannot say

de…nitively whether there has been in‡ation in marriage transfers overall. Second, our results only
speak to non-zero dowries, if the transition from bride prices to dowries passes through zero, this
will not be recorded as a dowry in our categorization. Third, we do not address the important issue
of participation in the dowry system, which may be increasing over time and con‡ated with the
idea of dowry in‡ation in the literature. Lastly, we do not address the issue of marriage transfers
outside of the dowry itself, which may also be con‡ated with the concept of dowry in‡ation. Shenk
(2005), for example, …nds that while marriage costs (ceremonies and gifts) have increased, dowry
itself has not risen over time in India. Even with these caveats, our results cause us to question
the existence of dowry in‡ation. Further retrospective studies of marriage transfers in South Asia
are needed to uncover the links between marriage transfers and social and economic outcomes for
women in South Asia.

Appendix

A key element to our analysis is that the rice price series should be used to de‡ate dowry amounts. If the
rice price series is incorrect or prone to error, however, the conclusions that we draw from correlations of
our de‡ated dowries with time are suspect. In Table A we show the sources used to construct our rice price
series. In Table B we show the correlation of our rice price series with two aggregate measures of price levels
from the Penn World Tables, which measure both overall and consumer price levels for each country for
which we have dowry data. Table B shows that the correlation of our price series with both types of price
series is quite strong– above .65 in all instances. Also, with the exception of Bangladesh, the correlations
are all above .85, suggesting that our results would change little if we used either of these aggregate price
series instead of our rice price series.
The lower panel of Table B shows estimates from the growth rate of GDP per capita from 1950 to 2000.
As the estimates show, there were high levels of growth of income per person in the second half of the
twentieth century. As such, the growth of dowries would have to be extraordinarily high to outpace the
growth of income person.

Data Appendix
ICRISAT

The ICRISAT survey began in May 1975 covering six villages in three districts, two from Maharashtra
and one in Andra Pradesh, while another 4 villages from two other districts, one from Gujarat and the
other from Madhya Pradesh, were added in 1980. The main objective of the ICRISAT was to understand
the socioeconomic, agro-biological, and institutional constraints to agricultural development in Semi-Arid
Tropical (SAT) areas and to gather information to help in generating feasible technologies that would be
acceptable to the farmers.
The …ve districts selected in the ICRISAT represent the major agro-climatic zones within the SAT of
India. A representative taluka was selected from each district, and about 12 to 20 villages in the tulaka were
visited for each one that was chosen that represented the typical characteristics of the taluka. A total of 40
respondent households were selected from each village to ensure representation of all categories of households
- labor, small farmers, medium farmers, and large farmers (10 landless labor household and 30 cultivator
households).
The ICRISAT consists of various schedules. The C Schedule contains information on household members
–age, sex, marital status, education level, primary and secondary education of household members, including
permanent servants, attached laborers, and other non-relatives. Another …ve schedules: E, F, G, N, and P
make up the General Endowment Schedule. E, F, G, and N schedules give inventory …les for animals, farms
implements, and current physical stock (such as food grains, fodder, farm inputs, and building materials,
etc.), while the P Schedule provides information on …nancial assets and liabilities, such as bank accounts, life
insurance, and loans. Schedule Y provides information on plot and cultivation schedule to record operationwise input-output data for each plot/subplot making a household’s/farmer’s holdings.
Schedule L (or the LFILES) consists of a group of nine …les containing household transaction data. Each
transaction is recorded as a separate observation. The dowry transactions are identi…ed using the account
and item codes. Transactions for income/expenses owing to gift, dowry remittances, pension, theft, etc.
have an account code number 64, while transactions related to marriage of own son have an item code 5 and
those related to the marriage of own daughter an item code 6. After identifying the dowry transactions for
own son or daughter for the household, the transactions are summed for each year to get the total value of
dowry received by the household and the total value of dowry paid by the household. The total number of
dowry observations is 119, of which those related to marriage of own daughter is 65.
Dowry information: Note that net dowry used in the correlations and scatterplot is de…ned as the
di¤erence in the dowry paid to the other side in the marriage to that coming into the household from the
other side in the marriage, i.e. dowry_out – dowry_in, so a positive net dowry value means that the
household is giving more in dowry than it is getting from the other side in the marriage. Summary statistics
are listed in Appendix Table C.

SWAF

The Survey on the Status of Women and Fertility (or SWAF) was initiated with a grant competition by
the Rockefeller Foundation’s Population Sciences Division that sought to foster research on the relationship
between the status of women and fertility. These surveys were initiated to provide measures of women’s
autonomy and the roles played by women within households and communities that were lacking in existing
surveys. The surveys were …elded in 1993 and 1994. SWAF India sought to have 1600 respondents with 800
each from the states of UP and Tamil Nadu. Two sites were chosen from each state; one that was developed
and the other that was poorly developed, with the aim of drawing 400 respondents from each site equally
divided into Hindus and Muslims. Districts in each of the states were ranked, and the least and the most
developed districts with su¢ cient proportion of the population being Muslim and which weren’t politically
unstable were chosen. Similarly, talukas (sub-districts) in the chosen districts were ranked and one of the
most developed ones was chosen for the developed district, while one of the least developed ones was chosen
for the lesser-developed district. Once the talukas were chosen, village lists were drawn up and contiguous
villages were combined to form clusters of 1000-2000 households, and the cluster to be included in the sample
was then randomly selected. However, the actual survey has 2446 respondents, 1551 of which are drawn
from Tamil Nadu.
Dowry information: The sample is restricted to respondents who were married one or more times
(1842 respondents). Respondents give information about whether or not they received dowry and if so they
categorize the level of payment (None, a little, moderate amount, a lot, don’t know value) for each type of
dowry, i.e. land, jewelry and cash. The correlations between dowry and year are computed using the sample
of respondents who said that dowry or gifts of bride price was paid in their marriage and who did not give a
“don’t know value” response for each of the types. Out of the 1842 respondents, 1658 said that some form
of dowry or gifts was paid during their marriage. The year of marriage was computed using the year of
birth and age at the time of marriage. Respondents were asked to give both age at the time of marriage
and the age and year/month of gauna, i.e. the time when the husband and wife start living together. The
dowry and year correlations use year of marriage and not the year of gauna. Summary statistics are listed
in Appendix Table D.

2.3

PIHS

The dowry information is collected in the following part of the survey: Section 15 - Credit and Savings, Part
D2 – Dowries, in which the primary respondent is female. The sample for the dowry/year correlations is
restricted to married women who responded that dowry was provided by her family and the sum of payments
for the various forms of dowry did not add to zero. Year of marriage took place between 1984 and 1991
for all 657 respondents who paid some form of dowry. Questions were asked about value of dowry paid
as agricultural land, jewelry/currency, household e¤ects, and other goods and properties. The values for
the various forms of dowries are summed to get the value of total dowry paid for the woman’s marriage.
Summary statistics are listed in Appendix Table E.

2.4

MATLAB

There are 5312 women for whom year of marriage is reported or can be reconstructed from age and age at
marriage. In addition, we have 391 previous marriages reported, giving a total of 5703 marriages. Of these,
1731 women report a positive dowry at the time of marriage. In 562 marriages, the husband con…rmed that
a dowry was given, and in 112 marriages, a husband reported a dowry even when the wife did not. This
gives a total of 1843 marriages in which dowry was reported. Of these, in 1704 marriages the wife reports the
dowry amount (including the value of goods at the time of marriage). In addition, we have 663 marriages in
which the husband reports the dowry amount but the wife does not. In 556 marriages we have two reports
of dowry; for the results reported, we take the average of the reports. All results are qualitatively similar
when we exclude husbands’dowry reports. Summary statistics are listed in Appendix Table F.

2.5

NLSS

The NLSS asked about dowry information at the household level in Section 6, Part C, under “Inventory of
Durable goods.” Questions were asked about the household ownership of the following items, the number of items owned, how many years ago they were acquired, and to classify whether they were purchased, given as gifts, or as dowry/inheritance: Radio/cassette player, Camera/camcorder, Bicycle, Motorcycle/scooter, Motor car, etc., Refrigerator/freezer, Washing machine, Fans, Heaters, Television/VCR,
Pressure lamps/petromax, Telephone sets/cordless, Sewing machine. The respondents do not classify the
items as purchased, gifts, or dowry/inheritance for the following: Furniture and rugs, Kitchen utensils, and
Jewelry. So these items were excluded when obtaining the dowry values.
Since the information is at the household level and not at the individual level, the year of marriage is
based on the responses for “how many years ago the item was acquired.”If the household reported multiple
items for a single year, the values of the items for the year are summed to get the total dowry …gure for that
year. There are a total of 146 dowry observations in the dataset. Summary statistics are listed in Appendix
Table G.
