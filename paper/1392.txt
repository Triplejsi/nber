June 1984

Are Business Cycles All Alike?
ABSTRACT

This paper examines two

questions. The first is whether

economic

cycles—are due to an accumulation of nall shocks or
instead mostly to infrequent large shocks. The paper concles that neither
of these two extreme views accurately characterize fluctuations. The second
fluctuations—business

question

is whether fluctuations are due mostly to one source of shocks, for

example monetary, or instead to many sources. The paper concludes that
evidence strongly supports the hypothesis of many, about equally important,
sources of shocks.

To analyze the empirical evidence and to reach these conclusions, the

paper uses two different statistical approaches. The first is estimation of
a structural model, using a set of just identifying restrictions. The second
is non—structural and may be described as a formalization of the Burns

Mitchell techniques. Both approaches are somewhat novel and should be of
independent interest.

Introduct ion

The propagation—impulse framework, which was introduced in economics by
Frisch (19331 and Slutsky [19271, has come to dominate the analysis of

economic fluctuations. Fluctuations in economic activity are seen as the
result of small, white noise, shocks——impulses——which affect the economy
through a complex dynamic propagation system.1'2 Much, if not most, of empirical macroeconomic investigations have focused on the propagation mechanism.
In this paper we focus on the characteristics of the impulses, and the impli—
cations of these characteristics for business cycles.

It is convenient, if not completely accurate, to summarize existing
research on impulses as centered on two independent but related questions.

The first question concerns the number of sources of impulses. It asks
whether there is one or many sources of shocks to the economy. Monetarists
often single out monetary shocks as the main source of fluctuations;3 this
theme has been echoed recently by Lucas [1977] and examined empirically by the

estimation of index or dynamic factor analysis models. The alternative view,
that there are many, equally important, sources of shocks seems to dominate
most of the day—to—day discussions of economic fluctuations.

The second question concerns the way in which the shocks lead to large
fluctuations. It asks whether fluctuations in economic activity are caused by
an accumulation of small shocks, where each shock is unimportant if viewed in
isolation, or rather whether fluctuations are due to infrequent large shocks.
The first view derives theoretical support from Slutsky, who demonstrated that
the accumulation of small shocks could generate data which mimicked the

behavior of macroeconomic time series. It has been forcefully restated by

—2—
Lucas [1977]. The

alternative

view is less articulated but clearly underlies

many descriptions and policy discussions. It is that there are Infrequent,
large, identifiable shocks which dominate all others. Particular economic
fluctuations can be ascribed to particular large shocks followed by periods

during which the economy returns to equilibrium. Such a view is implicit in
the description of specific periods as the Vietnam War expansion, the oil
price recession, or the Volcker disinflation.

The answers to both questions have important implications for economic

theory, economic policy, and econometric practice. We cite three examples.
The role of monetary policy is quite different if shocks are predominantly

monetary or arise partly from policy and partly from the behavior of private
agents. The discussion of rules versus discretion is also affected by the
nature

of

shocks. If shocks are small and frequent, policy riles are clearly

appropriate. If shocks are instead one of a kind, discretion appears more

reasonable.4 Finally, if infrequent large shocks are present in economic time
series, then standard asymptotic approximations to the distribution of estima—
tors may be poor, and robust methods of estimation may be useful.

This paper examines both questions, using two different approaches to

analyze the empirical evidence. The

first

approach is the natural, direct

approach, in which we specify and estimate a structural model.

This allows

us to examine the characteristics of the shocks and to calculate their contri—
butions to economic fluctuations. In Section I we discuss the structural

model, the data, and the methodology in detail. In Section II we present the
empirical results. We conclude that fluctuations are due, in roughly equal
proportions to fiscal, money, demand, and supply shocks. We find substantial
evidence against the small shock hypothesis. What emerges however is not an

—3—
economy characterized by large shocks and a gradual return to equilibrium, but
rather an economy with a mixture of large and small shocks.

Our second approach to analyzing the data is an indirect one, which tests

one of the implications of the small shock hypothesis. If economic fluctuations arise from an accumulation of small shocks, business cycles must then

be, in some precise sense, alike. We therefore look at how "alike" they are.
The comparative advantage of the indirect approach is that it does not require
specification of the structural model; its comparative disadvantage is that it

may have low power against the large shock hypothesis. It is very similar to
the study by Burns and Mitchell [1947] of commonality and differences of busi-

ness cycles. Instead of focusing on graphs, we focus on correlation coefficients between variables and an aggregate activity index. While these correlation coefficients are less revealing than the Burns and Mitchell graphs they
do allow us to precisely state hypotheses and carry out statistical tests.

Our

conclusions

are somewhat surprising: Business cycles are not at all

alike. This, however, is not inconsistent with the small shock hypothesis,
and provides only mild support in favor of the view that large specific events

dominate individual cycles. These results cast doubt on the usefulness of
using "the business cycle" as a reference frame in the analysis of economic

time series. These results are developed in Section III.

variables, the variables of ultimate interest; they are output and the price

level. The other two are policy variables. The first is a monetary aggre-

gate, M1 , the second is an index of fiscal policy. We shall describe them
more precisely below.

The structural model is composed of four equations. The first two are
aggregate demand and aggregate supply. The other two are equations describing
policy; they are policy feedback rules. The vector

is the vector of four

structural disturbances. It includes aggregate supply and demand disturbances, as well as the disturbances in fiscal and monetary policy. The

matrices A. ,

i=

O,...n

represent the propagation mechanism.

We assume that the structural disturbances are contemporaneously uncorre—

lated, that their covariance matrix, D ,

is

diagonal. Rowever, we do allow

the matrix A0 to differ from zero, so that each structural disturbance is

allowed to affect all four variables contemporaneously.

Leaving •side, for the roment, the issue of identification and estimation of (1), we now see how we can formalize the different hypotheses about
the nature of the disturbances.

2. Is there a dominant source of disturbances?

There may be no single yes or no answer to this question. A specific
source may dominate short—run movements in output but have little effect on

medium—run and long—run movements. One source may dominate prices movements,
another may dominate output movements.

Variance decompositions are a natural set of statistics to use for shed-

ding light on these questions. These decompositions show the proportion of
the K—step ahead forecast error variance of each variable which can be attri-

buted to each of the four shocks. By choosing different values of K , we can
look at the effects of each structural disturbance on each variable in the
short, medium and long runs.

3. Are there infrequent larRe shocks?

A first, straightforward, way of answering this question is to look at
the distribution of disturbances —

or more precisely the distribution of

estimated residuals. The statement that there are infrequent large shocks can
be interpreted as saying that the probability density function of each shock

has thick tails. A convenient measure of the thickness of tails is the kur—
tosis coefficient of the marginal distribution of each disturbance,

E[tejt/aj)4]. We shall compute these kurtosis coefficients. In addition we
shall see whether we can relate the large realizations to specific historical

—6—
events and fluctuations.

This first approach may, however, be too crude for at least two reasons.
The first is that a particular source of shocks may dominate a given time
period, not because of a particular large realization but because of a

sequence of medium—sized realizations of the same sign. The second reason is
similar but more subtle. The system characterized by (1) in a highly aggre-

gated system. Unless it can be derived by exact aggregation — and this is
unlikely —

it

should be thought of as a low dimension representation of the

joint behavior of the four variables

.

in

this case the "structural" dis-

turbances c will be linear combinations of current and lagged values of the
underlying disturbances. An underlying "oil shock" may therefore appear as a
sequence of negative realizations of the supply disturbance in (1). For both
reasons, we go beyond the computation of kurtosis coefficients. For each time
period we decompose the difference between each variable and its forecast con-

structed K periods before, into components due to realizations of each structural disturbance.

If we choose K large enough, forecast errors mirror

major fluctuations in output as identified by NBER. We can then see
whether each of these fluctuations can be attributed to realizations of a
specific structural disturbance, for example whether the 73—75 recession is
mostly due to adverse supply shocks.

4. Identification and Estimation

0ux approach to identification is to avoid as much as is possible oven—
dentifying but controversial restrictions. We impose no restrictions on the

lag structure, that is on Ai=1...9n .

achieve identification by res-

trictions on A0 , the matrix characterizing contemporaneous relations between

detail.

fiscal

variable C is an

index which attempts to measure the effect of fiscal policy, that is, of
government spending, deficits and debt, on aggregate demand. It is derived
from other work (Blanchard [19841) and is described in detail in Appendix B.

hypothesis,

some of the realizations of the e and thus of x may be

large; we use therefore a method of estimation which may be more efficient

—8than OLS in this case. We use the bounded influence method developed by
Irasker and Welsch [1982], which in effect decreases the weight given to
observations with large realizations.6 We choose a lag length. n ,

Note that (1) and (2) imply:

Thus, to go from x to c we need to specify and estimate A0 , the set
of contemporaneous relations between the variables. We specify the following

(7)

We have chosen standard specifications for aggregate supply and demand.
Output supplied is a function of the price level.8 Output demanded is a function of nominal money, the price level and fiscal policy; this should be
viewed as the reduced form of an IS—LM model, so that

is a linear combi—

—9—
nation of the IS and LM disturbances. The last two equations are

policy

rules, which allow the fiscal index and money to respond contemporaneously to
output and the price level.9

Even with the zero restrictions on A0 implicit in the above equations,
the system of equations (4) to (7) is not identified. The model contains 8
coefficients and 4 variances which must be estimated from the 10 unique ele-

ments in 0 .

To achieve identification we use a priori information on two of

the parameters.

Within a quarter, there is little or no discretionary response of fiscal

policy to changes in prices and output. Most of the response depends on
institutional arrangements, such as the structure of income tax rates, the

degree and timing in the indexation of transfer payments and so on. Thus the

coefficients c1 and c2 can be constructed directly; the details of the
computations are given in appendix B. Using these coefficients, we obtain
from (6).

Given the two constructed coefficients c1 and c2 we now have six
unknown coefficients and four variances to estimate using the ten unique ele-

ments in 0 .

The model is just identified. Estimation proceeds as follows:

The validity of these instruments at each stage depends on the plausibility of the assumption that the relevant disturbances are uncorrelated.

Although we do not believe that this is exactly the case, we find it plausible

— 10 —

that

they have low correlation, so that our identification is approximately

correct.

It may be useful to compare our method for the identification and estima-

tion of shocks to the more common method used in the vector autoregression
literature. A common practice in that literature is to decompose, as we do,

the forecast errors into a set of uncorrelated shocks. There the identification problem is solved by assuming that the matrix (I—A0)

is triangular or

can be made triangular by rearranging its rows. This yields a recursive
structure that is efficiently estimated by OLS. We do not assume a recursive
structure but rather impose four zero restrictions in addition to constructing

two coefficients c1 and c2 .

Our method produces estimated disturbances

much closer to true structural disturbances than would be obtained by imposing
a recursive structure on the model.

Section II. The Direct AD1,roach. Resujts
1. Reduced form evidence

The first step is the estimation of the reduced form given by (2), The

estimated B.,i1,...,4 are of no particular interest. The estimated time
series corresponding to unexpected movements of x ,

that

is of y, m, p and g

are of more interest. Table 1 gives, for y, m, p and g , the value of residuals larger than 1.5 standard deviations in absolute value, as well as the
associated standard deviation and estimated kurtosis.

The kurtosis coefficient of a normally distributed random variable is

equal to 3. The 99% significance level of the kurtosis coefficient, for a
sample of 120 observations drawn from a normal distribution is 4.34. Thus,
ignoring the fact that these are estimated residuals rather than actual reali-

zations, three of the four disturbances have significantly fat tails. As
linear combinations of independent random variables have kurtosis smaller than
the maximum kurtosis of the variables themselves, this strongly suggests large

kurtosis of the structural disturbances.10 We now turn to structural estimation.

2. The structural coefficients
The second step is estimation of A0 , from equations (4) to (7). We use

constructed values for c1 and c2 of —.34 and —1.1 respectively. Unexpected increases in output increase taxes more than expenditures and lead to

fiscal contraction. Unexpected inflation increases real taxes but decreases
real expenditures, leading also to fiscal contraction. We are less confident

of c2, the effect of inflation than we are of c1. In Appendix A we report

The results of estimating (4) — (7) are reported in Table 2. All coeffi-

cients except one are of the expected sign. Nominal money has a negative contemporaneous effect on output; this is consistent with a positive correlation
between unexpected movements in money and output because of the positive

effect of output on money supply. Indeed the correlation m and y is .32.
(Anticipating results below, we find that the effect of nominal money on out-

put is positive after one quarter.) Aggregate supply is upward sloping; a
comparison with the results of Table Al suggest that the slope of aggregate

supply is sensitive to the value of c2

Given our estimates of the reduced form and of A0 , we can now decompose
each variable (Y P, M, G) as the sum of four distributed lags of each of the

structural disturbances d,€s,€m, and

.

Technically,

we can compute the

structural moving average representation of the system characterized by (1).

3. One or many sources of shocks. Variance decomposition.

Does one source of shocks dominate? We have seen that a natural way of
answering this question is to characterize the contribution of each distur-

bance to the unexpected movement in each variable. We define unexpected movement as the difference between the actual value of a variable and the forecast

constructed K periods earlier using equation (1). We use 3 values of K.

4. Are there infrequent large shç? I
Table 4 reports values and dates for all estimated realizations of

and 5g larger than 1.5

times

their respective standard deviation.

We can compare these to traditional, informal, accounts of the history of
economic fluctuations since 1948 and see whether specific events which have

been emphasized there correspond to large realizations. A useful, concise
summary of the events associated with large post—war fluctuations is contained
in Table 1 in the paper by Eckstein and Sinai in some volume.

The

first

major expansion in our sample, from 1949—4 to 1953—2 is usually

explained by both fiscal shocks associated with the Korean War and a sharp

increase in private spending. We find evidence of both in 1951 as well as in
1952. From 1955 to the early 70's, large shocks are few in number and not
easily interpretable. There are, for example, no large shocks to either fiscal policy or private spending corresponding to either the Kennedy tax cut or

to the Vietnam War. In the 1970's, major fluctuations are usually explained
by the two oil shocks. There is some evidence in favor of this description.
We find two large supply shocks in 1974—4 and 1975—1; we also find large fis-

cal and large demand shocks during the same period. The two recessions of the
early 1980's are usually ascribed to monetary policy. We find substantial

evidence in favor of this description. There are large shocks to money supply
for most of the period 1979—2 to 1982—4, and two very large negative shocks in

The overall impression is therefore one of infrequent large shocks, but
not so large as to dominate all others, and the behavior of aggregate vari-

ables for long periods of time. To confirm this impression, we report the
kurtosis coefficients of the structural disturbances in Table 5*; in all cases

we can reject normality with high confidence. in Table 5b we use another
descriptive device. We assume that each structural disturbance is an independent draw from a mixed normal distribution, that is for x = g, d, a or m:

The estimated values of

estimated by maximum likelihood are reported in Table 5b. The

results suggest large, but not very large, ratios of the standard deviation of
large to the standard deviation of small shocks; they also suggest infrequent,

but not very infrequent large shocks. The estimated probabilities imply that
one out of six fiscal or money shocks, and one out of three supply or demand
shocks came from the large variance distributions.

The dating of the large shocks in Table 4 suggests two more characteristics of shocks. First, large shocks tend to be followed by large shocks, suggesting some form of autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity as dis-

cussed in Engle (1982). Second, there seems to be some tendency for large
shocks to happen in unison. In 50:1 for example we find large fiscal, supply,
and demand shocks, while in 80:3 we find large supply, money, and demand

shocks. To confirm these impressions we present in Table 6 the correlations
and first autocorrelations between the squares of the structural shocks.1'
The table shows a large positive contemporaneous correlation between the
square of the supply shock and the square of the demand shock. A weaker contemporaneous relationship between supply and the fiscal shock is present. The

squares of all shocks are positively correlated with their own lagged values;
there is also significant correlation between demand, the lagged fiscal and
supply shocks, and between the fiscal shock and lagged supply shock.

All in

all these results suggest an economy characterized by active, volatile periods
followed by quiet, calm periods both of varied duration.

5. Are.there infrequent jg shocks? fl
We discussed in Section 1 the possibility that a specific source of

shocks may dominate some episode of economic fluctuations, even if there are

no large realizations of the shock. To explore this possibility, we construct
an unexpected output series, where the expectations are the forecasts of out-

put based on the estimated model corresponding to (1), 8 quarters before. We
chose $ quarters because the troughs and peaks in this unexpected output

series correspond closely to NBER troughs and peaks. We then decompose this
forecast error for GNP into components due to each of the four structural dis—

turbances.

This decomposition is represented graphically in Figure 1; the

corresponding time series are given in Table A2, in Appendix A.

No single recession can be attributed to only one source of shock. Post
war recessions appear to be due to the combination of two or three shocks.
The 1960—4 trough for example, where the GNP forecast error is —6.7% is attributed to a fiscal shock component (—2.4%), a supply shock component (—1.1%), a

money shock component (—1,7%) and a demand shock component (—1.4%). The
1975—1 trough, where the GNP forecast error is also —6.7% seems to have a
large suppiy shock component (—3.6%) and a demand shock component (—2.9%).
The 1982—4 trough, where the GNP forecast error if —4.5%

is

decomposed as

—1.4% (fiscal), 1.1% (supply), —1.4% (money) and —2.8% (demand).

To summarize the results of this section, we find substantial evidence

against the single source of shock hypothesis. We find some evidence of large
infrequent shocks; however they do not seem to dominate economic fluctuations.

Sect ion III. Ih!

If

indirect

!ich.

economic fluctuations are due to an accumulation of small shocks, then

in some sense, business cycles should be all alike. In this section, we make
precise the sense in which cycles should be alike and examine the empirical
evidence.

The most influential contributions to the position that cycles are alike
is the empirical work carried out by Burns and Mitchell on pre—Worid War II

data. Their work was not only focused on the characteristic cyclical behavior
of many economic variables but also on how, in specific cycles, the behavior

of these variables differed from their characteristic cyclical behavior. When
looking at their graphs, one is impressed at how similar the behavior of most

variables is across different cycles; this is true of quantities, for which it
may not be too surprising but also, for example, of interest rates.

We considered extending the Burns—Mitchell (B—M) graph method to the

eight post War cycles but decided against it. Many steps of the method, and
in particular their time deformation, are judgemental rather than mechanical.

As a result, it is impossible to derive the statistical properties of their

results. When comparing for example the graphs of short rates across two
cycles, we have no statistical yardstick to decide whether they are similar or

significantly different. As a result also, we do not know which details, in
the wealth of details provided in these graphs, should be thought of as significant.

Therefore, we use an approach which is in the spirit of Burns

and

Mitchell but allows us to derive the statistical properties of the estimators

we use. The trade off is that the statistics we give are much less revealing

— 18 —

than the B—M graphs. Our approach is to compute the cross correlations at
different leads and lags between various variables and a reference variable
such as GNP,

across different cycles.

The construction of correlation coefficients

The

first

step is to divide the sample into subsamples. We adopt the

standard division into cycles, with trough points determined by the NBFR chro-

nology. ThIs division may not be, under the large shock hypothesis, the most
appropriate as a large shock may well dominate parts of two cycles. It is,

however, the most uncontroversial. Defining the trough—to—trough period as a
cycle, there are seven complete cycles for which we have data; their dates are
given in Table 7. This gives us seven snbsainples.

For each subsample, we compute cross—correlations at various leads and
lags between the reference variable and the variable considered. Deterministic
seasonality is removed from all variables before the calculation of the corre—

1st ions. A more difficult issue is that of the time trend: the series may be
generated either by a deterministic time trend or a stochastic time trend or

by both. In the previous two sections, this issue was unimportant in the
sense that inclusion or exclusion of a deterministic trend together with
unconstrained lag structures in the reduced form made little difference to

estimated realizations of the disturbances. Here, the issue is much more
important. Computing deviations from a single deterministic trend for the
whole sample may be very misleading if the trend is stochastic. On the other
hand taking first or second differences of the time series probably removes
non—stationarities associated with a stochastic trend but correlations between
first or second differences of the time series are difficult to interpret.

— 19 —

In

their work, Burns and Mitchell adopt an agnostic and flexible solution

to that problem. They compute deviations of the variables from subsample

means. Thus they proxy

the

time trend by a step function:

although this

does not capture the time trend within each subsample, it does imply that

across subsamples, the estimated time trend will track the underlying one. We
initially followed B—M in their formalization but found this procedure to be

misleading for variables with strong time trends. During each subsample, both
the reference and the other variable are below their means at the beginning
and above their means at the end; this generates spuriously high correlation

between the variables. We modify the B—M procedure as follows: for each subsample, we allow both for a level and a time trend; the time trend is given by

the slope of the line going from trough to trough. This should be thought of
as a flexible (perhaps too flexible) parameterisation of the time trend,
allowing for six level and slope changes over the complete sample.

The cross—correlations are then computed for deviations of each of the

two series from its trend. We compute correlations of the reference variable
and of the other variable, up to two leads and lags.

jç. construction of confidence levels

For each variable we calculate cross—correlations with our reference

variable, GNP, for each of the seven cycles. We then want to answer the following questions: should we be surprised by the differences in estimated
correlation across cycles? More precisely, under the null hypothesis that
fluctuations are due to the accumulation of small shocks, how large are these

differences in the correlation coefficients likely to be? Thus, we must
derive the distribution of the differences between the largest and smallest

— 20 —

correlation

coefficients, at

each

lag or lead for each variable. This distri—

bution is far too difficult to derive analytically; instead we rely on Monte
Carlo simulations.

The first step is to estimate, for each variable, the bivariate process

generating the reference variable and the variable under consideration. We
allow for four lags of each variable and a linear time trend, for the period

1947:1 to 1982:4. The method of estimation is, for the same reasons as in
Section I, Irasker—Welach.

The second step is to simulate the bivariate process, using disturbances

drawn from a normal distribution for disturbances. (Thus we implicitly
characterize the "small shock" hypothesis as a hypothesis that this joint dis—

tributión is normal.) We generate 1000 samples of 147 observations each. We
then divide each sample into cycles by identifying troughs in the GNP series.
Let

denote the log of real GNP at time t. Time t is a trough if two condi-

tions are satisfied. The first is that

Xti ) t < 't+l < 't+2 < 't+3
and the second that

be at least 1/2 % below the previous peak value of x.

The first insures that expansions are longer than 3 periods and the second

eliminates minor downturns. (When applied to the actual sample, this rule
correctly identifies NBER troughs, except for two which differ from the NBE
trough by one quarter.) Given this division into cycles, we compute, as in the
actual sample, cycle specific correlations, and obtain, for each of the 1000
samples, the difference between the largest and the smallest correlation.

Finally, by looking at the 1000 samples, we get an empirical distribution for

21 —

the differences.
What we report in Table 7 for each variable and for correlations at

each

lead and lag are probabilities that in the corresponding empirical distributions, the difference between the largest and smallest correlation exceeds the

value of this difference in the actual sample. This probability is denoted P.
A very small value 21 P indicates that.

therefore be evidence against the small shock hypothesis.

The choice 21

variables

Most quantity variables such as consumption or investment appear highly
correlated with real GNP. Most of the models we have imply that it should be
so, nearly irrespective of the source of shocks. Most models imply that
correlations of prices and interest rates with GNP will be of different signs

depending on the source of shocks. We report results for various prices,
interest rates, policy variables, and quantities.

We look at three real wages. In all three cases, the numerator is the
same, the index of average hourly earnings of production and non—supervisory

workers, adjusted for overtime and interindustry shifts, in manufacturing. In
Table 7a, the wage is deflated by the GNP deflator. in Table 7b, it is
deflated by the CPI and is therefore a consumption real wage. In Table 7c, it
is deflated by the producer price index for manufacturers and is therefore a

product wage. In all three cases, we take the logarithm of the real wage so
constructed.

We then look at

jgflve LjQj,. Both are relative prices of materi—

als

in terms of finished goods. Because of the two oil shocks, we consider two

different prices. The first is the ratio of the price of crude fuels to the

producer price index for finished goods and is studied in Tible 7d. Table 7e
gives the behavior of the price of non—food, non—fuel materials in terms of
finished goods.

We then look at the behavior of interest rates. Table 7f characterizes
the behavior of the nominal three month treasury bill rate. Table 7g gives
the behavior of Moody's AAA corporate bond yield.

We consider the two rolicv variables: the fiscal index defined in the
first section, and nominal M1 •

The results are given in Tables 7h and 7i.

Finally, we consider three quantity variables. Table 7j shows the
behavior of real consumption expenditures. Tables 7k and 71 show the behavior
of non—residential and residential investment.

General results.

In looking at Table 7, there are two types of questions we want to

answer. The first is not directly the subject of the paper but is clearly of
interest. It is about the typical behavior of each variable in the cycle.
The answer is given, for each variable by the sequence of average correlation

coefficients at the different lags and leads. How do these sequences relate
to B—M graphs? The relation is roughly the following: If the sequence is flat
and close to zero, the variable has little cyclical behavior. If the sequence
is flat and positive, the variable is procyclical, peaking at the cycle peak:
if flat and negative, it is countercyclical, reaching its trough at the cycle
peak.

— 23 —

If

the sequence is not flat, the variable has cyclical behavior but

reaches its peak, or its trough if countercyclical, before or after the cycli-

cal peak. If for example, p_1 is large and negative, this suggests that the
variable is countercyclical, reaching its trough one quarter before the cycli-

cal peak. As expected the quantity variables are pro—cyclical; there seems to
be a tendency for non—residential investment to lag GNP by one quarter and
residential investment to lead GNP by one quarter. We find little average

cyclical behavior of real wages. Relative fuel prices and long—term interest
rates are countercyclical and lead GNP by at least two quarters. Relative
non—food/non—fuel materials and short—term rates appear to be pro—cyclical.
We now turn to the second question. which is one of the subjects of this
paper. Row different are the correlations and are these differences surprising?

The first part of the answer is that correlations are vy different
across cycles. This is true both for variables with little cyclical behavior
such as the real wage, or for variables which vary cyclically, such as nominal

rates. These differences suggest that business cycles are indeed not all
alike. The second part of the answer may however also be surprising: it is
that under

small shock j.!jjs, such differences j unusual. For

most correlations and most variables, the P values are not particularly small.
Thus, the tentative conclusion of this section is that, although business
cycles are not very much alike, their differences are not inconsistent with
the hypothesis of the accumulation of small shocks through an invariant propagation mechanism.

Section IV. Conclusions

In Sections I and II we specified and estimated a structural model which
allowed us to directly investigate the properties of shocks and their role in

economic fluctuations. From this analysis we conclude that fluctuations are
due, in roughly equal proportions to fiscal, money, demand, and supply shocks.

We find substantial evidence against the small shock hypothesis. What
emerges, however, is not an economy characterized by large shocks and a gradual return to equilibritmi, but rather an economy with a mixture of large and
small shocks.

In Section III we investigated the influence of shocks on economic fluctuations in an indirect way by examining stability of correlations between

different economic variables across all of the post—war business cycles. Here
we fouDd that correlations were very unstable——that business cycles were not

at all alike. This, however, is not inconsistent with the small shock
hypothesis, and provides only mild support in favor of the view that large

specific events dominate the characteristics of individual cycles. These
results cast doubt on the usefulness of using "the business cycle" as a reference frame in the analysis of economic time series.

— 25 —

Footnotes

1. This framework is only one of many which can generate fluctuations.
Another one, which clearly underlies much of the early NBER work on
cycles is based on floor—ceiling dynamics, with a much smaller role for

impulses. There are probably two reasons why the white noise impulse—
linear propagation framework is now widely used. It
is convenient to use both analytically and empirically, because of its

close relation to linear time series analysis. Statistical evidence
which would allow to choose between the different frameworks has been
hard to come by.

2. In the standard dynamic simultaneous equation model impulses
the exogenous variables and the noise in the system.

arise from

In the model we

employ we do not distinguish between endogenous and exogenous variables.
The entire system is driven by the innovations (the one step ahead forecast errors) in the variables. A portion of whalt we call "innovations"
would be explained by current movements of exogenous variables in large

macroeconomic models. For example, we find large negative "supply" innovations in late 1974. In a large model these would be explained by oil
import prices.

3. A supplement to the Journal

Monetary Economics was devoted to the

analysis of the sources of impulses in different countries, using the

Brunner—Meltzer approach. Conclusions vary somewhat across countries but
"measures expressing an unanticipated or accelerating monetary inpulse
figure foremost" [Brunner and Me].tzer, p. 14, 19781.

— 26 —

4.

A good example of the importance of the nature of the shocks for the
rules versus discretion debate is given by the answers of Lucas and Solow
to the question, "What should policy have been in 1973—1975?" in Fischer
[19801.

5.

We

assume that the propagation mechanism is linear and time invariant.

Violation of either of these assumptions would likely lead to estimated
shocks whose distributions have tails thicker than the distribution of
the true shocks.

6. LAD or other robust M estimators, could also have been used. in some
circumstances OLS may be more efficient than the robust estimators
because of the presence of lagged values.

7. Each equation in the vector autoregression included a constant and a
linear time trend. When the vector autoregression was estimated without
a time trend the estimated residuals. x , were essentially unchanged.
8. A more detailed specification of aggregate supply, recognizing the
effects of the price of materials would be:

y =

d1p

—

d2(p—p)

+

a

ys

Pmd3P+d4y
where supply depend on the price of materials,

p , and

the price level,

and where in turn the nominal price of materials depends on the price

level and the level of output. The two equations have, however, the same
specification, and it is therefore impossible to identify separately the

shocks to the price of materials and to supply, lm and c

.

a linear combination of these two shocks.

If money supply responds to interest rates directly rather than to output

and prices, €m and d will both depend partly on money demand ahocks
and thus will be correlated. Our estimation method will then attribute

as much of the variance as possible to m and incorporate the residual
in

or equal to 3. Then if Z is a linear combination of X1 and X2
< max (K11K2)

We do not, however, assume independence but only zero

correlation of the structural disturbances.

11. While the contemporaneous correlation between the levels of the shock is
zero by construction, the same is not true of the squares of the shocks.

Appendix B. Construct ion of the fiscal index C.

The index is derived and discussed in Blanchard [1984]. Its empirical
counterpart is derived and discussed in Blanchard [1983]. This is a short
summary.

1. The theoretical index

The index measures the effect of fiscal policy on aggregate demand at

given interest rates. It is given by:

—

I

T

e

r+ (s—t)dS) +

where
ZtIBtZTt are government spending, debt and taxes. 't,s denotes the antici-

,

pation, as of t

first

The

of

a variable x at time s,

term measures the effect of fiscal policy on consumption.

is

the propensity to consume out of wealth. B is part of wealth and increases
consumption. The present value of taxes, however, decreases human wealth and
consumption; taxes are discounted at a rate (r + p)

rate r .

The second term captures the direct effect of government spending.

The index can be rewritten as:

G = (Z

the effect of unexpected price movements on actual and full employment

We assume that, within a quarter, there is no discretionary response of

g to either y or p .

The response depends only on institutional arrange-

ments. We therefore use the results of deLeeuw et al. [1980] and deLceuw and
Holloway [1982] (hereafter dL8O and dL82) to construct a.,

a2, 0, and 02

From Table 19 of dL8O a one percentage point increase in the unemployment

rate increases spending in the first quarter by .6% at an annual rate. From
Okun's Law it is reasonable to assume that a 1% innovation in output reduces

unemployment by roughly .1 percentage point in the first quarter. Putting

these together we have a1 = —.06.

a2

G is composed of (1) purchases of goods and services, (2) wage payments
to government employees, and (3) transfer payments. There is little or no
effect of unexpected inflation on nominal purchases within a quarter.
Although parts of (2) and (3) are indexed, indexation is not contemporaneous.

Nominal payments for some transfer programs (Medicare, Medicaid) increase with

inflation. A plausible range for a2 is —.8 to —1.0.

We choose —.9 for the

computations in the text.

We considered four categories of taxes and income tax bases:
