Corporate Financing and Investment
Decisions When Firms Have Information
That Investors Do Not Have

ABSTRACT

This paper considers a firm that must issue common stock to raise
cash to undertake a valuable investment opportunity.

Management is

assumed to know more about the firm's value than potential investors.

Investors interpret the firm's actions rationally.

An equilibrium

model of the issue-invest decision is developed under these assumptions.
The model shows that firms may refuse to issue stock, and therefore may
pass up valuable investment opportunities.

The model suggests explana-

tions for several aspects of corporate financing behavior, including
the tendency to rely on internal sources of funds, and to prefer debt

to equity if external financing is required.

Extensions and

applications of the model are discussed.

CORPORATE FINANCING AND INVESTMENT DECISIONS WHEN FIRMS
HAVE INFORMATION THAT INVESTORS DO NOT HAVE

Stewart C. Myers and Nicholas S. Majluf1

Consider a firm that has assets in place and also a valuable real
investment opportunity.

However, it has to issue common shares to raise part

or all of the cash required to undertake the investment project.

If it does

not launch the project promptly, the opportunity will evaporate.

There are o

taxes, transaction costs or other capital market imperfections.

Finance theory would advise this firm to evaluate the investment
opportunity as if it already had plenty of cash on hand.

In an efficient

capital market, securities can always be sold at a fair price; the net present
value of selling securities is always zero, because the cash raised exactly
balances the present value of the liability created.
is:

Thus, the decision rule

take every positive—NPV project, regardless of whether internal or

external funds are used to pay for it.

What if the firm's managers know more about the value of its assets and
opportunities than outside investors do?

As we will show, nothing fundamental

is changed so long as managers invest in every project they know to have
positive NPV.

If they do this, the shares investors buy will be correctly

priced on average, although a particular issue will be over or underpriced.
The manager's inside information creates a side bet between old and new
stockholders, but the equilibrium issue price is unaffected.
However, if managers have inside information there must be some cases in
which that information is so favorable that management, if it acts in the
interest of the old stockholders, will refuse to issue shares even if it means

passing up a good investment opportunity.

That is, the cost to old

shareholders of issuing shares at a bargain price may outweigh the project's

investors, aware of

their relative ignorance, will reason that a decision not to issue shares
signals "good news."
good.

The news conveyed by an Issue is bad or at least less

This affects the price investors are willing to pay for the issue,

which in turn, affects the issue—investment decision.

If the firm finally decides not to issue and therefore not to invest—and
we will show formally how this can happen——real capital investment Is
misallocated and firm value reduced.

Of course, we would also expect

management to try to rearrange the firm's capital structure to avoid being
caught in this "financing trap" the next time the firm has a positive—NPV
investment.

Thus, our analysis of how asymmetric information affects firm's

Issue—Investment decisions may lead us to explain some corporate financing
choices as attempts by firms to avoid the problems we have just introduced.
The first problem is to figure out the equilibrium share price conditional
on the issue—investment decision, assuming rational investors, and also a
rational firm which bases the issue—investment decision on the price it
faces.

This paper addresses that problem, and solves it under reasonable

simplifying assumptions.

The assumptions are set out and discussed in Section 1. This section also
contains a numerical example.

A general formulation and solution Is given in

Section 2.

However, Section 2's results raise deeper issues.

Our solution assumes

that management acts in the interests of "old" (existing) stockholders.
also assumes those stockholders are passive, and do not adjust their

It

—5—

portfolios in response to the firm's Issue—invest decision, except possLbly to
buy a predetermined fraction of any new issue.
This assumption makes financing matter.

A firm with ample financial

slack——e.g., large holdings of cash or marketable securities, or the ability
to issue default—risk free debt——would take all positive—NPV opportunities.
The same firm without slack would pass sóme up.

Also, with this assumption

about management's objective, our model predicts firms will prefer debt to
equity if they need external funds.

If old shareholders are assumed to be active, and to rebalance their
portfolios in response to what they learn from the firm's actions, then
financing does not matter:
decisions.

financial slack has no impact on Investment

Even with ample slack, the firm will pass up some positive—NPV

I nvestments.

We can choose from three statements about management's objective under
asymmetrical information:
1.

Management acts in the interests of all shareholders, and ignores any

conflict of interest between old and new shareholders.
2.

Management acts in old shareholders' interest, and assumes they are

passive.
3.

Management acts in old shareholders' interest, but assumes they

rationally rebalance their portfolios as they learn from the firm's
actions.

We have so far found no compelling theoretical justification for favoring
any one of these statements over the other two.

A theory, or at least a

story, could be developed to support any one of the three statements.
suggest some of these stories as we go along.

We will

However, we do not claim to

—6—

have a theory of managerial behavior fully supporting our model.

We treat the

three statements as possible assumptions about managerial behavior.

Since we

cannot. judge the assumptions' realism, we turn instead to their positive
implications.

The three statements yield substantially different empirical predictions.
Statement (2) leads at this stage of the empirical race, because it explains
why stock prices fall, on average, when firms announce an equity issue.
Moreover, it explains why debt issues have less price impact than stock
issues.

We briefly review this evidence in Section 3.

A model based on

(a) asymmetric information and

(b) management acting in

the interests of passive, old stockholders may explain several aspects of
corporate behavior, including the tendency to rely on internal sources of
funds and to prefer debt to equity if external financing is required.

Some of

the model's implications are discussed in Parts 4 and 5 of the paper.

We

defer the customary introductory review of the literature until the end of
Section 1, after our assumptions have been more fully explained.

not have, and that both managers and investors realize this.

how much information managers should release, except to note the underlying
assumption that transmitting information is costly.

Our problem disappears if

managers can costlessly convey their special information to the market.

The investment can be financed by issuing stock, drawing down the firm's

Financial slack chould also include the amount of default—risk free debt

(Discussion of risky debt is deferred to Section 2.)

However, it's simpler for our purposes to let the firm use risk—free borrowing

We also assume that market value of the firm's shares equals their

expected future value conditional on whatever information the market has.

The

future values could be discounted for the time value of money without changing
anything essential.2

Discounting for risk is not considered, because the

only uncertainty important in this problem stems from managers' special
information.

Old stockholders are assumed passive.

They "sit tight" if stock is

issued; thus the issue goes to a different group of investors.

If the

firm has ample slack, and thus does not need to issue shares In order to
invest, old shareholders also sit tight if the investment is made.

Thus,

acting in old stockholders' interest amounts to maximizing the true or
intrinsic value of the existing shares.

(Here "true" or "intrinsic"

value means what the shares would sell for, conditional on the firms'
issue—invest decision, if investors knew everything that managers know.)

We realize this passive—stockholder assumption may be controversial.
We will discuss it further in Section 3 below.

If you work through this case, you will find that the trial solution, in which

equilibrium solution.

that the firm cannot afford to pass It up, even though new shares must be sold

Since shares are issued in both states,

the decision to issue conveys no information, and

Discussion

The conventional rationale for iolding financial slack——cash, liquid
assets, or unused borrowing power——is that the firm doesn't want to have to
issue stock on short notice in order to pursue a valuable investment
opportunity.

Managers point to the red tape, delays and underwriting costs

encountered in stock issues.

They also typically say, "We don't want to be

forced to issue stock when our firm is undervalued by the market."

A financial economist might respond by asking, "Managers may have superior
information, but why should that be a disadvantage?

if we admit that the firm

is sometimes undervalued, then sometimes it must be overvalued.

Why

can't

—14—

firms take advantage of the market by issuing securities only when the firm is
overpriced? •'

Our examples suggest answers for these questions:

slack has value because

without it the firm is sometimes unwilling to issue stock and therefore passes
up a good investment opportunity.

Slack does not allow the firm to take

advantage of investors by issuing only when stock is overvalued:

if investors

know the firm does not have to issue to invest, then an attempt to issue sends
a strong pessimistic signal.

Slack is clearly unnecessary If the firm has a "private line" to existing
stockholders.

However, private communication to old stockholders would be

difficult and also illegal.

Slack is also unnecessary if the firm can compel

its old stockholders to buy and hold the new issue; In this case, the conflict
between old and new stockholders does not exist.

Our examples suggest that slack allows the firm to avoid external
financing, and thereby to avoid entangling its investment decisions in
possible conflicts of interest between old and new shareholders.6

Slack

therefore allows the firm to avoid the consequences of managers' Inside
information.

Unfortunately, this conclusion is not as neat as it appears at

first, for it rests on assuming that old stockholders are passive, and do not
rebalance their portfolios when they learn whether the firm invests.

If they

do rebalance, conflicts of interest between old and new shareholders occur
even if the firm has ample slack.

We return to this point in Section 3.

—15—

Information

Costs

The value of slack disappears if the firm can costlessly convey its
special knowledge to all investors, new as well as old.

One way to justify

our contrary assumption is to think of cases in which values depend on
proprietary information which, if released to the market, would be released t

competitors also, consequently reducing either the value of its
asset—in—place, the NPV of its investment opportunity, or both.

The firm cannot convey that information by saying, "We have great
prospects, but we can't tell you the details."

In our model, the firm always

has the incentive to do this, so such statements carry no information.

The

firm has to supply verifiable detail sufficient to indicate the true state of
nature. The costs of supplying, absorbing and verifying this information may
be significant.

Yet making it public will in most cases tell the firm's

competitors all they want to know.7

There can also be information asymmetries when there is no need to guard
proprietary information.

Educating investors takes time and money.

After

all, the managers' information advantage goes beyond having more facts than
investors do.

Managers also know better what those facts mean for the firm.

They have an insider's view of their organization and what it can and cannot
do.

This organizational knowledge is part of managers' human capital; they

acquire it as they work, by conscious effort as well as by trial and error.
An outside investor who tried to match an equally intelligent manager on this
dimension would probably fail.

By this argument, the separation of ownership

from professional management naturally creates asymmetric information,

—16—

Related Work

Our problem is similar to the one addressed by Akerlof (1970), who showed
how markets can break down when potential buyers cannot verify the quality of
the product they are offered.

Faced with the risk of buying a lemon, the

buyer will demand a discount, which in turn discourages the potential sellers
who do not have lemons.

However, in our paper, the seller Is not offering a

single good, but a partial claim on two, the asset—in—place and the new
project.

Moreover, the seller gives up one of them (the new project) if the

partial claim is not sold.

Without this more complex structure, we would have

little to say, beyond noting that securities can be lemons too.

Akerlof's paper was one of the first Investigations of the economics of
unevenly distributed information.

The assumption of asymmetric information

underlies extensive recent work on agency costs, signalling, adverse
selection, etc.

A detailed review of all that is not needed here.

However,

several articles are directly relevant to our problem:

He describes the resulting financing

His main point is to provide a new

rationale for debt financing through financial intermediaries.

It may, for

example, be possible to reveal proprietary information to a bank without
revealing it to competitors; the bank could then finance a new project on
terms which are fair to old stockholders.

This line of analysis is further

explored in Campbell and Kracaw (1980).

However, Campbell does not consider what happens if a firm with
proprietary information does attempt a public Issue.

He presents no formal

willing to pay for their share of it.8
This suggests a possible extension to our model.

If managers also are

(old) stockholders, then managers' inside information may be conveyed by the
amount of the new issue they are willing to buy for their personal portfolios.
3.

Bhattacharya and Ritter (1983) pose a problem similar to ours, but end

up pursuing a different Issue.

We fix the extent of managers' inside

information and examine the equilibrium Issue—investment decision.

They ask

how much information the firm should reveal, assuming that each revelation
provides information to competitors as well as Investors, and therefore
reduces the value of the firm.

They show that the firm may be able to convey

its true value to investors without revealing everything Its competitors would
like to know.

However, their search for signalling equilibria carries them a

long way from this paper's analysis.
4.

Rendleman (1980) also sets a problem similar to ours,

His Investors

may over— or undervalue the firm's assets or investment opportunities or
misassess its risk.

He focuses on the choice between debt and equity

financing, but does not derive a full equllibriummodel.

For example, he

shows that undervalued firms will typically prefer debt, but does not model
the market's response to the firm's choice of debt over equity.

In general

—18—

management's choice of financing must convey information about the firm's
intrinsic value and actual risk.

In our model however, the firm never issues

equity when it has the option to issue debt, regardless of whether the firm Is
over— or undervalued,
5.

We prove this later in the paper.

Giammarino and Neave (1982) present a model in which the firm and

investors have different perceptions of the risk——e.g., variance——of the
return on an investment opportunity, but agree on the mean return.

They

concentrate on the choice among financing instruments, and develop a rationale
for convertibles.

Our model is in most respects more general, since we allow

different information about any aspect of the distributions of asset values.
However, we do not consider convertibles as such.

We have further comments on

these authors' results in Section 3.
6.

Miller and Rock (1982) present a model of dividend policy under

asymmetric information.

If the amount of investment and external financing is

held fixed, the cash dividend paid by the firm reveals its operating cash
flow.

Thus, a larger—than—expected dividend reveals larger—than—expected cash

flow, and stock price increases.

A larger—than—expected external financing
Thus

reveals lower—than—expected cash flow, which is bad news for investors.

Miller and Rock's model predicts that announcements of new security issues
will, on average, depress stock price.
Section 2.

So does our model, as we will show in

However, ours also yields more specific hypotheses about what

kinds of securities firms choose to issue and how that choice affects the
magnitude of the stock price change.

These issues, and the relevant empirical

evidence, are discussed further in Section 3.
7.

There are other theoretical papers exploring how managers' inside

information is signalled to investors.

They include Bhattacharya's work on

equity financing is always inferior to precommitting to debt.
Thus, our model may explain why many firms seem to prefer internal
financing to financing by security issues and, when they do issue, why they
seem to prefer bonds to stock.

This has been interpreted as managerial

capitalism——an attempt by managers to avoid the discipline of capital markets
and to cut the ties that bind managers' to stockholders' interests.

In our

model, this behavior is in the stockholders' interest.

Equity Issues in Asymmetric Information Models

The chief difficulty with this analysis of the debt—equity choice is that
we end up leaving no room at all for stock issues.

We could of course

recreate a role for them by introducing agency or bankruptcy costs of debt, as
discussed in, for example, Jensen and Meckling (1976), Myers (1977), and Smith
and Warner (1979).

But it is also possible to rationalize equity issues in

models based on information asymmetries alone.

Our proof that debt dominates equity uses the standard option—pricing

—32—

assumption that percentage changes in wilue are lognormally distributed with a
constant variance rate known by everyone.

However, suppose there is a large

information asymmetry about the (future) variance rate.

If investors

underestimate the variance rate, the firm will be tempted to issue debt, but
if they overestimate it, the firm will be tempted to issue equity, other
things equal.

Thus, a decision to issue equity may not signal a sure capital

loss for new stockholders, but simply that the firm is safer than prospective
bondholders think.

Thus equity issues are not completely ruled out in

equilibrium.

Ciammarino and Neave (1982) set up a model in which the managers and
investors share the same information about everything except risk.

In this

case, equity issues dominate debt issues, because the only time the firm wants
to issue debt is when they know the firm is riskier than investors think.
Investors, realizing this, refuse to buy.

Only equity, or perhaps a

convertible security, is issued in equilibrium.
Firms actually seem to favor debt over equity issues, not the reverse.

believe asymmetric information about firm value is a stronger determinant of

We

financing behavior than asymmetric information about risk, and we will so
assume in subsequent comments, although future empirical research could of
course prove us wrong.

On the theoretical side, an obvious next step is to

analyze the debt—equity choice in a version of our model which explicitly
allows information asymmetry on the two dimensions of firm value and firm
variance.

one of them could sue, and probably win if the inispricing were obvious and the
motive clear.

The law requires a manager to worry about the terms of

financing; we think it encourages the manager to look at financing from the
viewpoint of the passive investor.

Consider the altered Instructions, "Take all positive—NPV projects, and
issue securities at a fair price conditional on market information only."

In

other words, managers should use their special information on the demand side,
but ignore it when it comes to financing.

24

However, these instructions are

still not fully credible, not only because of the mental dIscipline required,

but also because managers' personal interests are likely to be more closely
aligned with old stockholders' interests than with new stockholders'.
Consider a manager who is also a stockholder.

If he always buys and holds

a pro rata share of any new issue, and maximizes the intrinsic value of his

holdings, then his interests will be aligned with all securityholders', and ne
will maximize the intrinsic value of the firm.

However, most managers would not want to buy a pro rata share of every tew

The

reasons why can be traced to the same portfolio considerations which prevent
old stockholders from buying all of every new issue——loss of diversification
and, In extreme cases, limits to personal wealth.

If the manager does not buy

all of every new issue then his interests as a shareholder are those of an
(informed) old shareholder.

There is still another complication:

—38—

Empirical Evidence

It is easy to see why managers should take all positive—NPV projects, but
hard to build a completely convincing theory explaining why they would always
do so.

We think it more likely that managers having superior information act

in old stockholders' interest.

We also think that existing empirical evidence

supports our view.

If management acts in old shareholders' interests, our model predicts that
the decision to issue and invest causes stock price to fall.

If management

took all and only positive—NPV projects, even when issuing and investing
reduces the intrinsic value of the "old" shares, the same decision would
either increase stock price or leave it unchanged.

The decision to invest

would reveal the existence of an attractive project (i.e.,

b >

0).

This is

good news, unless Investors knew for sure that the firm would have that
investment opportunity.

It cannot be bad news in any case.

Recent papers by Dann and Mikkelson (1982), Korwar (1982), and Asquith and
Mullins (1983) show significant negative average price impacts when a new
stock issue is announced.

"Information effects" are an obvious explanation.

However, as far as we know, ours is the only complete model explaining how
such an information effect could occur in a rational expectations equilibrium.

issue—investment decision constant.

But the model holds everything but the
In particular, it ignores the flow to

investors of other information about the firm's prospects.

This flow creates

a random error in any measurement of how a stock price changes in response to
a specific event.

—39—

If our interpretation of these results is accepted, we can set aside,

at

least for the present discussion, models assuming managers simply "accept all
positive—NPV projects."

If managers act in old shareholders' interests, do they assume those
shareholders are passive or active?

Do they just maximize the existing

shares' value, or do they work out how rational shareholders' portfolio
choices depend on their decisions?
These questions can also be answered empirically.

If managers assume

active shareholders, then only the investment decision matters.

Good

investments are foregone even when the firm has plenty of cash to pay for
them.

However, if managers assume passive stockholders, then financing

matters and firms will adapt their financing policy to mitigate the loss in
value from foregone investment opportunities.

For example, managers will try

to build up financial slack on order to avoid situations in which a security
issue Is required to finance a valuable investment opportunity.

If

information asymmetries relate primarily to firm value, rather than risk,

managers will favor debt over equity financing If external capital is required.
In our framework, the "passive investor" assumption gives a variety of
interesting hypotheses about corporate financing.

That is why we use the

assumption for most of this paper's formal analysis.

We noted that Dann and Mikkelson (1982) found a significant negative
average price impact when stock Issues are announced.

They also looked at a

sample of debt issues, and found no significant price impact.

Our model may

The "passive investor" assumption implies that stock price falls when

However, stock price should not fall If default risk—free

—40—

debt is issued, because the ability to issue risk—free debt is equivalent to

having ample financial slack, and having ample slack insures that the firm
will take all positive—NPV projects.

Thus, in our model the only information

conveyed by the decision to issue risk—free debt and invest is that the firm
has a positive—NPV project.

This causes a positive price change unless the

project's existence was known beforehand.

Under the "active investor" assumption, the decision to invest would be
bad news, and the choice of debt over equity financing would not make the news
any better.

Choosing this assumption would give us no way to explain Dann and

Mlkkelson' s results.

Of course, the debt issues examined by Dann and Mlkkelson were not
literally default—risk free.

But if the probability of default on these

issues was small, their negative "information effect" should likewise be
small.

EXTENSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS

Having explained our model formally, and having discussed its assumptions
and some of its empirical implications, we can now turn to a few extensions,
qualifications, and further observations.27

We specifically address two

questions:
1.

What happens when the information asymmetry is temporary?

What

happens when it is permanent but the firm has no immediate need for funds,
except to build up slack?
2.

What does our model say about mergers?

—41—

Discussing these questions leads us to other issues, for example, the
implications of managers' superior information for dividend poiicy.

An Easy Way Out
There is of course an easy way out of the problems described in this
paper——an easy way to avoid any loss of market value:

just issue stock at

t = —1, when managers and the market are assumed to share the same

information.

That is one lesson of our model.

If managers know more than thE>

market does, firms should avoid situations in. which valuable investment

projects have to be financed by stock issues.

Having slack solves the

problem, and one way to get slack is to issue stock when there is no
asymmetric information.

That is not an easy way out, however, if the information asymmetry is
permanent.

We will not here pursue analysis of the optimal issue strategy in this
dynamic setting.

However, we have shown that the problems addressed In this

paper do not go away when the firm has no immediate real investment
opportunity.

Given asymmetric information, a firm with valuable future real

Investment opportunities is better off with slack than without It.

Moreover,

—43—

it should build up slack through retention rather than stock issues.

This is

consistent with actual retention policies of most public firms, which limit

dividends so that they will rarely have to go to the market for fresh equity.
Thus we add one item in favor of the list of possible arguments for
dividend payouts low enough to avoid reliance on external equity financing.
On the other hand, dividends would alleviate the problems posed in this
paper if they help signal the true value of

'X,

thus reducing

crA.

However, this is not necessarily an argument for high average payout;

it

merely supports payout policies with a high correlation of changes In
dividends and changes in the value of assets in place.

This could explain why

dividend payments respond to changes in earnings, not market value, if book
earnings primarily reflect the performance of assets—in-place.

At this point, we revert to our original three—date model, In which
asymmetric information is important only at

t =

0.

Mergers

Our model's main message is this:

given asymmetric information, a firm

with insufficient financial slack may not undertake all valuable investment
opportunities.

Thus, a firm that has too little slack increases its value by

acquiring more.

One way to do this is by merger.

In our model, a merger always creates

value when one firm's surplus slack fully covers the other's deficiency.28
Of course this gain is only one of dozens of possible merger motives.

But we

have nothing to say here about other benefits or costs, so we will assume them
away' here.

—44—

It turns out that the same conditions that create a potential gain from
transferring surplus slack between merger partners will also complicate the
merger negotiations, and in some cases rule out any possibility of their
successful completion.

CONCLUSION

We have presented a model of the issue—investment decision when the firm's
managers have superior information.

We can sum up by reviewing some of the

model's most interesting properties.
1.

It is generally better to issue safe securities than risky ones.

Firms should go to bond markets for external capital, but raise equity by
retention if possible.

That is, external financing using debt is better than

financing by equity.
2.

Firms whose investment opportunities outstrip operating cash flows,

and which have used up their ability to issue low—risk debt, may

forego

Investments rather than issue risky securities to finance them.

This is done

in the existing stockholders' interest.

good

However, stockholders are better off

ex ante—-I.e., on average—when the firm carries sufficient financial slack to
undertake good investment opportunities as they arise.
The ex ante loss in value increases with the size of the required
equity issue,

Thus, increasing the required investment or reducing slack

available for this investment also increases the ex ante loss.

In addition,

numerical simulations indicate the loss decreases when the market's
uncertainty about the value of assets In place is reduced, or when the
investment opportunity's expected NPV is increased.
3.

Firms can build up financial slack by restricting dividends when

investment requirements are modest.

The cash saved is held as marketable

securities or reserve borrowing power.

The other way to build slack is by issuing stock in periods when
managers' Information advantage is small; firms with insufficient slack to

cover possible future investment opportunities would Issue in periods where

—47—

managers have no information advantage.

However, we have not derived a

generally optimal dynamic issue strategy.
4.

The firm should not pay a dividend if it has to recoup the cash by

selling stock or some other risky security.

Of course dividends could help

convey managers' superior information to the market.

policy under which changes in dividends are highly correlated wIth rnanagei

nevertheless in the (existing) stockholders' interest.

This actiou i;

If the firm issues

safe (default—risk free) debt to finance investment, stock price will not fall.
6.

A merger of a slack—rich and slack—poor firm increases the firm's

combined value.

However, negotiating such mergers will be hopeless unless the

slack—poor firms' managers can convey their special information to the
prospective buyers.

If this information cannot be conveyed (and verified,

slack—poor firms will be bought out by tender offers made directly to their
shareholders.

Of course, the six items stated just above depend on the specific
assumptions of our model and may not follow in other contexts.

We have only

explored one of many possible stories about corporate finance.

A full

description of corporate financing and investment behavior will no doubt
require telling several stories at once.

stock, and who acts alone, buying one percent of the new issue, will reap
only one percent of his action's rewards.

If arranging a group action is

costly, then individual investors' Incentives will not make

If their portfolios are "sticky," the conflict f

between old and new shareholders is reduced.

However, any

investor who sells out will not face the full cost of his actions, Irc

management's

decision depends on old stockholders' overall participation

in the new project.

23. Existing securityholders could protect against this ripoff by taking a ro
rata share of each new issue.

But this would be cumbersome at bests

It

would also invite a different kind of ripoff, in which outside
securityholders buy an overpriced issue while insiders and their friends
sell or sell short.

24. This suggests the idea that managers could avoid conflicts between old ani
new shareholders by concealing the firm's investment decision.

In

Case I, on the other hand, the investment decision cannot be concealed
because a stock Issue necessarily comes first.
25. Miller and Rock's model would predict the same negative stock price impact
regardless of the type of security issued.

26. You would expect that the riskier the instrument Issued, the greater the
issues' impact on the market value of the firm.

However, we have not bee:i

able to prove that this positive relationship is always aionotonic.

27. "Our model" includes the assumption that nanagers act in old stockholders'
interests, and that those stockholders are passive in the sense discussed
above.

28. If the merged firms' total slack does not fully cover their investment
requirements, the merger may or may not increase value.

See Majiuf

(1978), pp. 239—256.

31. The cash—poor firm would prefer to negotiate with a firm that is not a
competitor.

A competitor might back out of the negotiations and take

advantage of information acquired in them.

This hazard Is less in a

"conglomerate" merger.

33. However, there is no mechanism in our model to insure that such a policy
would be faithfully followed.
