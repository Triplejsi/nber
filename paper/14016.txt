Estimation of De Facto Exchange Rate Regimes: Synthesis of the Techniques for Inferring
Flexibility and Basket Weights
Jeffrey A. Frankel and Shang-Jin Wei
NBER Working Paper No. 14016
May 2008
JEL No. F31,F41
ABSTRACT
The paper offers a new approach to estimate de facto exchange rate regimes, a synthesis of two techniques.
One is a technique that the authors have used in the past to estimate implicit de facto weights when
the hypothesis is a basket peg with little flexibility. The second is a technique used by others to estimate
the de facto degree of exchange rate flexibility when the hypothesis is an anchor to the dollar or some
other single major currency, but with a possibly-substantial degree of flexibility around that anchor.
Since many currencies today follow variants of Band-Basket-Crawl, it is important to have available
a technique that can cover both dimensions, inferring weights and inferring flexibility. We try out
the technique on twenty-some currencies, over the period 1980-2007. Most are currencies that have
officially used baskets as anchors for at least part of this sample period. But a few are known floaters
or known simple peggers. In general the synthesis technique seems to work as it should.

Estimation of De Facto Exchange Rate Regimes:
Synthesis of the Techniques for Inferring Flexibility and Basket Weights
Jeffrey Frankel, Harvard University
and Shang-Jin Wei, Columbia University
Exchange rate surveillance has moved back to the top of the lists of the IMF’s
mandates and priorities. Before one can evaluate whether a given country is following
the right exchange rate regime, however, one must decide what the regime is that it is
following. This seemingly simple task is far harder than one might think. Perhaps the
Fund staff could use some new analytical tools if it is to pursue this assignment
conscientiously and persuasively. This paper proposes a technique to classify a de facto
regime. It estimates simultaneously the implicit currency weights in the basket that
anchors the home currency, and the degree of flexibility around that anchor.
De facto versus De Jure Classification of Exchange Rate Regimes
It is by now well-known that there is a big difference between de facto exchange
rate regimes, that is, the regimes that countries follow in practice, and de jure exchange
rate regimes, that is, the regimes that national governments officially claim to be
following and which, at least until 1997, were reproduced by the International Monetary
Fund almost unquestioningly in the table at the front of International Financial Statistics.
The discrepancy between de facto and de jure is pervasive. In the first place, most
countries that claim to “fix” are not, in fact, firmly fixed. Countries declaring a peg,
often abandon it. Obstfeld & Rogoff pointed out in their 1995 article “The Mirage of
Fixed Rates,” that only 6 major economies (leaving aside some with capital controls) had
kept a peg longer than five years. Klein and Marion (1997) reported that the mean
duration of pegs in the Western Hemisphere was only 10 months.
In the second place, most countries that claim to “float,” are not in fact floating.
Calvo & Reinhart (2002) coined the phrase “Fear of Floating.” They showed that the
variability of foreign exchange reserves relative to the variability of the exchange rate
was not only substantial for those who claimed to be floating (one might expect zero for a
true pure floater), but that it tended to be fully as great as for those who are officially
pegging. Many emerging market countries that claim to float, sometimes under an
official monetary rule of Inflation Targeting, in fact have intervened heavily in recent
years to dampen the appreciation of their currencies.
In the third place, many countries that claim to be following one of the transparent
intermediate regimes, namely a basket peg (or even a basket with a band), keep the
weights in the basket secret. The most logical motivation is so that the government can
surreptitiously depart from the official regime. When a country declares a basket peg
with a band, it typically would take more than 100 observations for an observer to
distinguish statistically whether it is in fact following this policy (Frankel, Schmukler &
Serven, 2000). The national authorities are no doubt aware of this when they decide to
keep the basket weights secret.

There is no more topical illustration of this problem than the Chinese yuan. The
Beijing authorities announced a change in exchange rate regime in July 2005, a switch
away from a dollar peg and toward a more flexible regime with reference to a basket of
11 currencies, with a small (but cumulative) band. They did not announce what were the
weights on the currencies. As with so many other basket peggers, there is reason to
suspect that the secrecy is not an accidental oversight. It is there deliberately to cloak a
discrepancy between de jure and de facto. That the yuan is not just another currency -but lies at the heart of the disagreement to which the United States currently chooses to
give top priority in its relations with China -- makes it a particularly relevant example.
There are by now many attempts to discern the true “de facto” exchange rate regimes
that countries actually follow. Some of the more prominent include Ghosh, Gulde &
Wolf (2002), Levy-Yeyati & Sturzenegger (2005), Reinhart & Rogoff (2003, 2004) and
Shambaugh (2004). Most of these classification schemes depart from the official
classification in the direction of counting as de facto floating a country that has high
variability of the exchange rate (or of the change in the exchange rate), relative to
variability of reserves, and counting as fixed a country that has low variability of the
exchange rate relative to reserves. A recent survey covers 11 studies.1 It divided the
studies into two categories, viewed as:
z “pure de facto classifications because…assignment of regimes is based solely on
statistical algorithms and/or econometric estimation.”
z Vs. “mixed de jure-de facto classifications, because the self-declared regimes are
adjusted by the devisers for anomalies.” One of the latter is the official product of
the IMF’s former Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department: Bubula & OtkerRobe (2002), where the adjustment is accomplished both by consulting IMF
economists and by looking at movements in reserves & exchange rates.
While the discrepancy between the de jure regimes and any given de facto regime is
well-known, it is less widely recognized that the various de facto regimes hardly
correspond any more closely to each other than to the official classification.2 Table 1
reports calculations of correlations or correspondence across different classification
schemes. There are various explanations for the variation in conclusions reached by the
different classification schemes: differences in methodology, different choices as to
where to draw the line between regimes, differences in timing of the data, and so forth.
But perhaps the best way of summarizing the problem is that, apart from a relatively
small number of countries that peg firmly (e.g., countries with institutional commitments
in the form of currency boards) and the handful that float freely (e.g., the United States),
most follow some messy intermediate regime that is not easily identified or
unambiguously classified. This flies in the face of the famous “Corners Hypothesis” that
rapidly became the conventional wisdom in the late 1990s, and has subsequently declined
almost as rapidly. The Corners Hypothesis claimed that countries were abandoning the
intermediate regimes in favor of the two corners: exchange rates fixed institutionally, as
through a currency board, vs. freely floating exchange rates. But it is a fact that a

All codings are collapsed to binary peg and nonpeg.

One intermediate regime is the basket peg. Often it comes combined with a
managed float that “leans against the wind” to push the current exchange rate back in the
direction of the central parity when it wanders afield, or more specifically with an
announced band (target zone). 4 In any case, the weights in the basket are often kept
secret, as already noted. There exists a branch of the de facto classification literature that
is different from and smaller than the research on flexibility versus fixity cited above.
The second approach applies especially to countries that are thought possibly to use
baskets, for example because they say they do. This approach discerns from actual data
the implicit weights placed on the constituent foreign currencies of the basket. The
simple methodology was first developed in the early 1990s to test whether a country that
announces a basket peg but does not reveal the exact weighting of the component
currencies is acting in a manner consistent with its words: Frankel (1993) and Frankel
and Wei (1994, 1995). The approach has since been used by others, including BénassyQuéré (1999), Ohno (1999), Frankel, Schmukler and Servén (2000), Frankel, Schmukler,
Servén and Fajnzylber (2001) and Bénassy-Quéré, Coeuré, and Mignon (2004).5
These two branches of the literature have hitherto remained separate, in splendid
isolation. It could be argued that each has its own place. If one is confident that a
country is following a basket peg, and is unsure only of the weights, one should then use
the weight-inference technique. If one is confident of the major anchor currency (dollar,
euro, etc.) in terms of which a government defines the value of its own currency, and is
4

Williamson (2001) proposes that many Asian countries should adopt combinations of baskets and bands
(and perhaps crawls, which he pioneered).
5
More recently, it has been applied to China’s yuan: Eichengreen (2006), Shah, Zeileis, and Patnaik
(2005), Yamazaki (2006, p.8) and Frankel and Wei (2007).

unsure only of the strength of the effort to stabilize, then one should use one of the
methods of the larger branch of the literature, such as comparing the variability of the
exchange rate (vis a vis the dollar or euro, etc.) to the variability of reserves. The
problem is that some countries do define a central parity in terms of weights but then
allow variation around that parity. China since 2005 is a good example of a country that
claims to be doing this, and Chile in the 1990s is a good example of a country that
actually did it. And even if one suspects that a country is in truth following a simple peg,
it is always better to have a meaningful alternative hypothesis within which the null
hypothesis is nested. Thus we want to estimate basket weights, rather than presuming we
know the anchor currency, while at the same time allowing for some variation around the
central parity, as in a target zone or managed floating. Hence our proposal for a synthesis
of the two types of techniques in use for estimating de facto regimes.
Inferring the De facto Degree of Flexibility
It is important when inferring the de facto flexibility of an exchange rate regime
to look beyond the variability of the exchange rate in itself. The korona could show a
higher degree of variability than the thollar, and yet this might be because the korona has
been subject to larger shocks than the thollar, rather than because the authorities intervene
less and allow a given shock to show up more in the form of price movement. Thus we
want to look at the variability of the exchange rate relative to the variability of foreign
exchange reserves, or the monetary base, or some other monetary aggregate.
Figure 1 is a preliminary look at the data on exchange rate variability and reserve
variability for 15 countries. We selected our sample to emphasize countries that claim to
follow a basket peg, but added in a few that are known to be firm peggers and others that
are known to be floaters, to be able to calibrate the results along the fixed-versus-floating
dimension. We chose nine (small) countries that have been officially identified by the
IMF as following basket pegs: Latvia, Papua New Guinea, Botswana, Vanuatu, Fiji,
Western Samoa, Malta and the Seychelles. We also added several known floaters:
Australia, Canada and Japan, and three peggers of special interest: Hong Kong, China
and Malaysia. The paper emphasizes commodity-exporting countries, such as Norway,
in our list of currencies examined, for reasons that will be obvious later.6 Variances are
computed for 7-year intervals, within the period 1980-2007. The aim in choosing this
length of the interval is that it be long enough to generate reliable estimates of the
parameters, and yet not so long as inevitably to include important changes in each
country’s exchange rate regime. Here, as throughout this paper, we work with
logarithmic changes in the exchange rate.

6

Before any readers hear faint alarm bells about the absence of a complete or random sample, we will note
that we have no need of a random or complete sample. We have no need of a random sample because,
although we are testing hypotheses about individual currencies, we are not testing any general hypotheses
(like all countries are at the corners). We have no need of a complete sample, because we are not
attempting to offer a complete classification of IMF members as many of the other papers in the literature
have done. Rather we are proposing a new technique. We have chosen to try it out on countries that we
think are of interest for one reason or another.

An upward-sloping line runs from the origin, and through the point representing
average variance of (logarithmic change in) reserves and the average variance of
(logarithmic change in) reserves. The points that lie well above this upward-sloping line
represent countries that intervened actively in the foreign exchange market to stabilize
their currencies during the period in question, for example, the Seychelles. The points
that lie well below this upward-sloping line represent flexible-rate countries, where the
authorities allow fluctuations in the demand for their currencies to show up primarily as
movements in the exchange rate, for example, Japan. The downward sloping line runs
through the point representing the medians of reserve variability and exchange rate
variability, and is also drawn so that half the points are above and to the right of the line,
and the other half are below and to the left. The points in the first category represent
countries where shocks tend to be large; this tends particularly to be the case with
commodity producers, such as Botswana and Papua New Guinea. The points below and
to the left of the downward-sloping lines represent countries where shocks tend to be
small, for example, Hong Kong.
Several interesting lessons emerge from the graph, even without further analysis.
The first is the folly of judging a country’s exchange rate regime – specifically, the extent
to which it seeks to stabilize the value of its currency – by looking simply at variation in
the exchange rate. The 1980-86 Australian dollar shows a higher exchange rate
variance than the 2001-07 Japanese yen. But this is not because the Australian dollar
followed a more flexible exchange rate policy at that time. It is rather because Australia
was hit by much larger shocks. One must focus on exchange rate variability relative to
reserve variability to gauge where the country sits on the spectrum from fixed to floating.
Perhaps this is obvious, but some have focused exclusively on exchange rate variability.7
The second interesting lesson to be drawn from the graph – though a less original
observation than the first – is that countries that specialize in mineral products tend to
have larger shocks, which presumably take the form primarily of volatility in their terms
of trade. The third lesson, which was quite surprising when it was first noticed but
should be familiar by now, is that even countries that float hold and use foreign exchange
reserves in substantial magnitudes, sometimes more actively than countries that peg.8
An example in the graph is Canada in the 1980s. The fourth lesson is a counterpart to
the third: a currency with a firm peg like the Hong Kong dollar can experience very low
variability of reserves, because it has very low variability of shocks. It may in part be
the absence of commodities in Hong Kong’s production portfolio that makes possible the
low level of shocks. But the low variability in international demand for the Hong Kong
dollar must also result in part from the stability and credibility that the currency board has
itself achieved. After all, Hong Kong did experience large shocks in the late 1990s – the
reversion of the territory from Britain to China and the East Asia crisis – and yet the
shocks do not show up in either the exchange rate or reserves. Reassuring nervous

Among the sinners one could point to are the Frankel and Frankel-Wei papers listed in the references.
In the early 1970s, when the international monetary system moved from fixed exchange rates to floating,
the demand for international reserves did not fall as would have been predicted. Early references include
Frenkel (1978) and Bilson and Frenkel (1979). Similarly, when many emerging market countries switched
to more flexible exchange rate exchange rate regimes, or even to outright floating, in the currency crises of
1994-2002, the demand for reserves subsequently did not fall, but rather rose sharply (Rodrik, 2006).

investors presumably was the goal in the first place, when the Crown Colony of Hong
Kong adopted the currency board in 1983.
It is for just such reasons that the classification schemes of Calvo & Reinhart
(2002) and Levy-Yeyati & Sturzenegger (2005) do not look at exchange rate variability
alone (prices), but rather compare it to variability in reserves or money supplies
(quantities). The question is: when there is a shock that increases international demand
for korona, to what extent do the authorities allow it to show up as an appreciation, and to
what extent as an increase in reserves. In this paper, we frame the issue in terms of the
Exchange Market Pressure variable, which is defined as the percentage increase in the
value of the currency plus the percentage increase in reserves (or the monetary base, or
M1).9 When this variable appears on the right-hand side of an equation and the
percentage increase in the value of the currency appears on the left, a coefficient of 0
signifies a completely fixed exchange rate (no changes in the value of the currency), a
coefficient of 1 signifies a freely floating rate (no changes in reserves) and a coefficient
somewhere in between indicates a correspondingly flexible/stable intermediate regime.
One limitation of these and other papers that estimate flexibility versus stability of
exchange rate regimes is that they sometimes have to make arbitrary judgments regarding
what is the major currency in terms of which flexibility and stability are to be defined.
The dollar is the most common choice. This may be fine for most Western Hemisphere
countries (though in fact not for Chile, and perhaps not Argentina and Brazil either). But
for European countries, the euro is obviously more relevant. And for many others,
particularly in Asia and the Pacific, and probably also the Middle East and parts of Africa,
the relevant foreign currency is neither the dollar nor the euro, but some (possibly tradeweighted) basket. It would be better to let the data tell us what is the relevant anchor for
a given country, especially for those that are not clearly in either the dollar or euro camp,
rather than making the judgment subjectively or a priori.10
Inferring De Facto Weights
So, on the one hand, the main branch of the regime classification literature has the
drawback that -- in its zeal to uncover the true degree of flexibility – it is unable to infer
the relevant anchor. But, on the other hand, the smaller branch of the literature
specializes in inferring the relevant anchor currency or basket under the null hypothesis
of a perfect fit, equally omits to include anything to help make sense out of the error term
under the alternative hypothesis that the country is not perfectly pegged to a major
currency or to a basket. The equation is correctly specified to infer the weights in the
case of a perfect basket peg, with an R2 of 1, but is on less firm ground if the authorities
allow even a relatively small band of flexibility around the central parity. Thus the
contribution of this paper is to bring these two branches of the literature together to
produce a complete equation suitable for use in inferring de facto regimes across the
spectrum of flexibility and across the array of possible anchors.

The progenitor of the Exchange Market Pressure variable, in a rather different context, was Girton and
Roper (1977).
10
Clearly many of the authors of these papers are fully aware of the issue.

Assume that the value of the home currency is indeed determined by a currency
basket. How does one then uncover the currency composition and weights in the basket?
This is a problem to which Ordinary Least Squares regression is unusually well suited.
If we know the list of currencies in the basket, or a list that includes as a subset those that
are used in the basket, then we regress changes in the log of H, the value of the home
currency against changes in the log values of the candidate currencies. This technique
from Frankel and Wei (1984, 1985) has recently been applied to the current Chinese
exchange rate regime.11
The reason to work in terms of changes rather than levels is the likelihood of nonstationarity. Concern for nonstationarity goes beyond the common refrain of modern
time series econometrics, the inability to reject statistically a unit root, which in many
cases can be attributed to insufficient power. Working in changes, we can also include a
constant term to allow for the likelihood of a trend appreciation (a key question of
interest in the new RMB regime) or trend depreciation (as in the crawling pegs popular in
Latin American and elsewhere in the 80s), whether against the dollar alone or a broader
basket. Algebraically, if the value of the home currency H is pegged to the values of
currencies X1, X2, … and Xn, with weights equal to w1, w2, … and wn, then
logH(t+s)-logH (t) = c + ∑ w(j) [logX(j, t+s) - logX(j, t)]

(1)

If the exchange rate is truly governed by a strict basket peg, then we should be able to
recover the true weights, w(j), precisely, so long as we have more observations than
candidate currencies, and the equation should have a perfect fit.
One methodological question, before we turn to the new synthesis estimation
specification. How do we define the “value” of each of the currencies? This is the
question of the numeraire. 12
11

Shah, Zeileis, and Patnaik (2005) adopted the implicit-weight methodology to study the Chinese currency
basket after July 21, 2005 and found that the RMB is still tightly pegged to the dollar and nothing else.
However, they only consider four candidate currencies in the RMB basket (the dollar, the yen, the euro, and
the pound), probably unaware of the eleven-currency disclosure made the Chinese central bank. In addition,
their sample was only the initial few months after July 21, 2005. Frankel and Wei (2006) extended to 11
the components of the basket, but found that the RMB regime in the second half of 2005 was still a tight
dollar peg – as tight as that of the Hong Kong SAR regime. Eichengreen (2006, p. 22-25) had daily
observations of data that ran from July 22, 2005, to March 21, 2006, and found a dollar weight around .9,
but with no evidence of a downward trend in the weight, and no significance on non-dollar currencies.
Each of these three papers was too early to catch the evolution in 2006. Yamazaki (2006, p.8) updated the
estimation, and found some weight had shifted to the euro, yen and won; but he estimated the equation in
terms of levels rather than changes (risking non-stationarity), did not allow for a trend, did not allow for the
other currencies on the list, and had a relatively small number of (bimonthly) observations. Frankel and
Wei (2007) updated the estimation, ran the equation in monthly changes, included the full list of 11
candidate currencies, and allowed for gradual evolution during the sample period in both the basket weights
and the trend term. We were not able to implement the present paper’s methodological innovation in the
case of the post-2005 RMB, because reserve data are only available monthly, and 18 observations are not
enough for estimation.
12

Frankel (1993) used purchasing power over a consumer basket of domestic goods as numeraire; Frankel
and Wei (1995) used the SDR; Frankel and Wei (1994, 2006), Ohno (1999), and Eichengreen (2006) used

10

If the exchange rate is truly a basket peg, the choice of numeraire currency is
immaterial; we estimate the weights accurately regardless. If the linear equation holds
precisely in terms of any one “correct” numeraire, then add the log exchange rate
between that numeraire and any arbitrary unit to see that the equation also holds precisely
in terms of the arbitrary numeraire. This assumes the weights add to 1, and there is no
error term, constant term, or other non-currency variable.
In practice, few countries take their basket pegs literally enough to produce such a
tight fit. One must then start to think about the nature of the error term and non-basket
factors in the regression (such as the trend term), and about whether they are better
measured in terms of one numeraire or another. The introduction of reserves or the
exchange market pressure variable as explanatory variables should soak up some of the
error term and give better estimates: by including on the right-hand side of the equation
percentage changes in total exchange market pressure (defined as percentage changes in
the value of the currency plus percentage change in reserves), the test can allow for the
fluctuations in demand for the currency that can push the exchange rate away from the
central basket parity. The hope is that this approach may do a better job of answering
the question to what extent the authorities intervene to stabilize the currency, not just the
question what is the basket in terms of which the authorities define stability.
If the true regime is more variable than a rigid basket peg, then the choice of
numeraire does make some difference to the estimation. Some authors in the past have
used a remote currency, such as the Swiss franc (e.g., Frankel and Wei, 1994). But a
weighted index such as the SDR or a trade-weighted measure is probably more
appropriate. Here is why. If the true regime is a target zone or a managed float centered
around a reference basket, where the authorities intervene to an extent that depends on
the magnitude of the deviation – and this seems the logical alternative hypothesis in
which a strict basket peg is nested -- then the error term in the equation represents shocks
in demand for the currency that the authorities allow to be partially reflected in the
exchange rate (but only partially, because they intervene if the shocks are large). Then
one should use a numeraire that is similar to that used by the authorities in measuring
what constitutes a large deviation. The authorities are unlikely to use the Swiss franc or
Canadian dollar in thinking about the size of deviations from their reference point. They
are more likely to use a weighted average of major currencies. If we use a similar
measure in the equation, it should help minimize the possibility of correlation between
the error term and the numeraire. Similarly, if there is a trend in the exchange rate
equation (a constant term in the changes equation) representing deliberate gradual
appreciation of the currency, then H should be defined in terms of whatever weighted
exchange rate index the authorities are likely to use in thinking about the trend. These
considerations suggest a numeraire that is itself composed of a basket of currencies. We
choose here the Special Drawing Right (SDR).

the Swiss franc; Bénassy-Quéré (1999), the dollar; Frankel, Schmukler and Luis Servén (2000), a GDPweighted basket of five major currencies; and Yamazaki (2006), the Canadian dollar.

11

logH(t+s)-logH (t) = c + ∑ w(j) [logX(j, t+s) - logX(j, t)]
+ ß {emp(t+s)-emp(t)} + u t+s

(2)

One way to define the percentage change in total exchange market pressure13 is by
{emp(t+s)-emp(t)} ≡ {logEMP(t+s)-logEMP(t)}
≡ {[logH(t+s)-logH (t)] + [ logRes(t+s)-logRes(t)]}.
The w(j) coefficients capture the de facto weights on the constituent currencies. The
coefficient ß captures the de facto degree of exchange rate flexibility : ß=1 means the
currency floats purely, because there is no foreign exchange market intervention (no
changes in reserves) ; ß=0 means the exchange rate is purely fixed, because it never
changes in value ; and most currencies probably lie somewhere in between.
Endogeneity is a possible problem, and is addressed below.14
We have tried estimating the equation without imposing a constraint on the sum
of the weights in the basket. But there is a good argument for constraining the weights
on the currencies to add up to unity: ∑ w(j) = 1. However weak one thinks the link to
the reference basket might be and however large or small the weight on the dollar, the
authorities must view movements in the home currency through the metric of distance
from some reference rate or effective exchange rate. There is no point throwing away
the information represented by the summing-up constraint; we only have 48 observations
per regression, and we need every degree of freedom we can get. The easiest way to
implement the adding up constraint is to run the regressions with the changes in the log
value of the home currency on the left-hand side of the equation transformed by
subtracting off the changes in the log value of one of the currencies, say the British pound,
and the changes in the values of the non-pound currencies on the right-hand side
transformed in the same way.
To see this, we repeat equation (2), with some of the major currencies made
explicit:
logH(t+s)-logH (t) = c + ∑ w(j) [logX(j, t+s) - logX(j, t)]
+ ß {logEMP(t+s)-logEMP(t)} + u t+s

(2’)

= c + w(1) Δ log $ t + w (2) Δ log €t + w (3) Δ log ¥t + w (4) Δ log £t +…
+ ß { logEMP(t+s)-logEMP(t) } + u t
We want to impose the adding up constraint w (4) = 1 - w(1) -w(2)- w(3) - …
We implement it by running the regression equation (3):
[Δ logH t - Δ log£t]
= c + w(1) [Δ log $t - Δ log £t] + w(2) [Δ log €t - Δ log £t] +
w(3) [Δ log ¥t - Δ log £t] + … + ß { logEMP(t+s)-logEMP(t) } + u t

(3)

The results reported in Table 2 come from the estimation of this equation. One
can recover the implicit weight on the pound by adding the estimated weights on the non13

As noted, another way to define Exchange Market Pressure is by expressing the change in reserves as
fraction of the level of the monetary base rather than as a fraction of the level of reserves. Such regression
results are reported subsequently.

Estimating the regression coefficient ß in equation (3) could be called “running on emp t .”

pound currencies, and subtracting the sum from 1. This coefficient estimate is reported
in the last row of the table. Imposing the constraint sharpens the estimates a bit.
Tables 2.1 through 2.21, respectively, present the individual results for 20
currencies.15 Again the currencies are those that are hypothesized to have followed a
basket peg, to try out the ability of the technique to infer the weights or reject the null
hypothesis, plus some clear floaters and clear peggers thrown in to calibrate the inference
of flexibility.
Endogeneity of the exchange market pressure variable is a possible concern. One
would prefer to observe changes in the international demand for the home currency that
are known to originate in exogenous shocks. In the case of countries that specialize in
the production of mineral or agricultural products, there is a ready-made instrumental
variable : changes in the terms of trade reflecting the price of the mineral or agricultural
product on world markets. (This assumes that the home country is too small to affect the
world price, which is a reasonable assumption in all but a few cases, such as Saudi Arabia
and oil.) Accordingly, Table 3 repeats the synthesis estimation technique, but for the
commodity producers it uses changes in the world price of the commodity in question as
an instrumental variable for changes in exchange market pressure.
There is a good argument, in the definition of exchange market pressure, for
computing the changes in reserves as a percentage of the monetary base, rather than as a
percentage of the level of reserves itself. The problem with the latter approach is that for
a country that holds relatively small levels of reserves, such as Canada and Australia, a
change in reserves that is very small in absolute terms can look like a moderately large
intervention in percentage terms, as we saw in Figure 1. Accordingly, on the vertical
axis of Figure 2 we express reserve changes as a percentage of the monetary base, rather
than as a percentage of themselves. Now Australia and Canada appear close to the
bottom of the range of reserve variability where they belong, well below the upwardsloping line that demarcates the fixers from the floaters. Correspondingly, Table 4 will
re-run the OLS regressions with reserve changes defined as a percentage of the monetary
base.
We begin with the estimated equations for three known peggers.
Table 2.1 reports the results for the Chinese yuan or RMB. It confirms earlier
findings of a perfect peg to the dollar during 2001-04 (dollar coefficient =.99, a flexibility
coefficient insignificantly different from zero, and an R2 of .99). In 2005-07 the EMP
coefficient suggests that only 90% of increased demand for the currency shows up in
reserves rather than 100%; but the dollar weight and R2 are as high as ever.

15

We omit the yen and other very major currencies from the list of home countries. Such a currency is
sufficiently large in world monetary markets that one cannot take the value of the other major currencies as
exogenous as is necessary to estimate the weights on the right-hand side of our equation. For other smaller
currencies, the assumption that the value of the dollar, euro, and other major currencies can be taken as
exogenous seems reasonable.

Reserve data: after subtracting off the imputed interest

The Hong Kong dollar is covered by Table 2.2. As one would expect given the
currency board arrangement, it is a simple tight peg to the US dollar: close to complete
weight on the dollar, zero flexibility, and perfect fit.16
Table 2.3 refers to the Malaysian ringgit. Only in 1996-99 – the period that
includes the East Asia crisis – is there evidence of exchange rate flexibility. During the
years 2000-2003 there is a perfect peg to the dollar (coefficient and R2 both =1). [This
confirms the danger of extreme multicollinearity if one includes the ringgit alongside the
dollar as candidate components of other Asian currencies, such as the Chinese yuan.] In
2004-07 the peg is still fairly strong, but here the weight of the US dollar falls to .6,
partially replaced by the Singapore dollar (with a weight of .4) . Table 3.3 uses for
instrumental variables the prices of tin and semiconductors (which, though a
manufactured good, has the properties of a commodity export). The most important

16

Estimates in the middle column show the ill effects of near-perfect multilcollinearity between the US
dollar and the Malaysian ringgit during this time interval. We should adopt a rule that whenever the
exchange rate between two potential regressors is virtually fixed, the smaller of the two currencies (in this
case the ringgit) should be dropped from the regression equation.

14

findings remain: a perfect dollar peg during 2000-2003, followed by a shift to a basket
consisting of an average of the US dollar and the Singapore dollar.
We now turn to a dozen or so countries that are considered to have pegged or
anchored to a basket for at least part of the sample period.
The results for the Botswana pula are reported in Table 2.4. For 1980-87, the
coefficient on EMP is essentially zero, suggesting very little exchange rate flexibility.
This is the right answer, since Botswana at this time was in a monetary union with South
Africa. One would have needed to use a priori knowledge to include the South African
rand on the right-hand side of the equation, which we did not do, but probably should do.
Botswana’s exit from the currency union shows up as a large increase in the EMP
variable during 1988-2007; in the current decade more than half of fluctations in the
demand for the pula have been allowed to show up in the exchange rate. Botswana is
officially on a basket peg. Indeed, the estimates show significant weights on the dollar
(around .5 during 1988-95, but declining thereafter), and later the yen (.2), the mark or
euro (.3-.6) and the pound (.2-.4), and they show R2s around .8, suggesting a semi-tight
peg. There is a significant negative trend in the value of the pula throughout.
Table 2.5 applies the synthesis estimation technique to the Chilean peso. The
EMP coefficient shows an intermediate degree of flexibility, consistent with the
proclaimed band of the 1980s and 1990s. The combination of a basket, band and crawl
seems able to explain most of the variation in the value of the peso in the 1990s (R2>.9).
The weight on the dollar is always high, but the yen also gets some weight in some years,
until after 1999 when only the euro complements the dollar. There is a significant
downward trend from 1980 to 1999. Of those countries to follow a BBC (Band-BasketCrawl) regime in the 1980s and 1990s, Chile is one of the few that announced explicitly
what were the parameters: basket weights, band width and rate of crawl.17 Our findings
correspond to the official regime, but only rather roughly. The band was officially
centered on the dollar alone in the 1980s, and was broadened to a basket starting in 1992.
Our estimates qualitatively capture the shift in emphasis away from the dollar; but they
find an apparently spurious weight on the yen in the mid-1980s and they miss entirely the
30% weight officially placed on the mark in the mid-1990s. Likewise, Chile officially
moved to full floating in 1999. Our estimates qualitatively show the increase in the
flexibility coefficient in 2000-03, but the estimates do not show the (loose) basket peg
disappearing completely as the Chileans claim is the reality.
Possible explanations for the lack of a close match between the official regime
and the estimates include: (1) the common disjuncture between de facto and de jure
(though it is much less likely to apply here than for other countries), (2) endogeneity of
the EMP variable, (3) some other shortcoming of the estimation technique, and (4)
changes in the parameters that occur more frequently than the four-year sub-periods
examined here. For the years since the September 1999 move to floating, (5) the failure
of the flexibility coefficient to approach 1.0 might possibly have the same explanation as
for Mexico: copper export earnings that add to reserves and yet are not considered by the
authorities to constitute active foreign exchange intervention.
17

Details reported in Appendix of Frankel, Schmukler, Servén and Fajnzylber (2001).

15

Explanation (2) can be addressed by the instrumental variables technique, for
which Chile is a natural candidate since copper is half its exports. Table 3.4 uses the
world copper price as the instrumental variable. At least the spurious significant
coefficient on the yen in the mid-1980s disappears. But the German mark still does not
make the dramatic appearance onstage in 1992-1999 that one would expect from the
official announcements.
Proposition (4) may be the real explanation, and it is harder to address. The
Chilean authorities announced 18 changes in regime parameters (basket weights, width of
band, and rate of crawl) during the 18-year period 1982 -1999. One could imagine
estimating each year separately, or matching the sub-samples to the official
announcements, or using more sophisticated econometric techniques that allow
endogenously-estimated breakpoints. The obstacle in all cases is that we have only
monthly data, so it is not possible to estimate meaningful parameter values if they change
every 12 months on average. The original Frankel-Wei technique required only
exchange rate data, which allowed estimation at a daily frequency (or even intra-day).
But the synthesis technique requires data on foreign exchange reserves, which are only
available monthly for most countries. Indeed the attempt to estimate six or more
parameters on each set of 48 observations may already be producing too much
“estimation error.”
Table 2.6 illustrates the Danish krone. The EMP coefficient suggests that a very
high share of fluctuations in currency demand are accommodated from foreign exchange
reserves. The weight on European currencies begins above .8, and rises to 1.0 with the
advent of the euro in 1999. The R2 ranges from .85 to .99. In short the evidence is
consistent with the known regime: Denmark remained behind in the 2 ¼ % band, when
its (non-Scandinavian) neighbors joined the euro.
Table 2.7 shows the Fiji dollar as being tightly pegged in most of the seven subperiods, with only 1984-87 and 1996-99 showing significant flexibility coefficients and
R2s below .9. It is another official basket pegger. High multicollinearity between the
US dollar and the Thai baht in 1988-95 prevents meaningful estimation of the
coefficients during that period. (The baht should be dropped on a priori grounds.) But the
weights are fairly well-estimated during the early and late years of the sample period.
For the sub-period 1980-83, the US dollar receives a weight of .4, with the rest falling on
the yen, Australian dollar and British pound. For the sub-period 2000-2003 they are: .2
on the US dollar, .2 on the euro, and .4 on the Australian dollar. (The New Zealand
dollar should be added on a priori grounds.)
The Kuwaiti dinar shows a firm peg throughout most of the period: a near-zero
flexibility parameter and R2 mostly above .9 (IV estimates in Table 3.5). In the second
half of the sample, the anchor was usually a simple dollar peg, though a small weight was
assigned to other currencies in the 1980s basket. In a widely watched move, the
Kuwaitis in 2007 abandoned the simple dollar peg that its partners in the GCC (Gulf
Cooperation Council) partners have been wedded to, and returned to a basket peg; but
this shift is probably too recent to have had a substantial effect on any of these estimates.

16

The Latvian lat, shown in Table 2.9, is officially on a basket peg. Here the
estimation technique appears to work well. The flexibility coefficient is low during the
1990s, and has disappeared altogether since 2000. The R2 exceeds .9 during 1996-2003.
The combination of low flexibility coefficient and a high R2 during 2000-2003 suggests a
particularly tight basket peg during these years. Initially the estimated weights include .4
on the dollar and .3 on the yen, but both decline over time. There is a weight of .3 on the
mark up until 1999, which is then transferred to the euro: .2 in 2000-2003 and .5 in 200407. Latvia is preparing to enter the eurozone. Surprisingly, however, the estimation
shows a coefficient of similar size on the Russian ruble popping up during 2004-07.
The Maltese lira (Table 2.10) shows a tight peg during 1984-1991 and 2004-07
(low flexibility coefficient and high R2). The share of the dollar varies between .2 and .4
during 1980-2003. The European currencies garner .3-.4 during 1980-1995, the pound
perhaps .2-.3 and the yen .1. At the end of the sample period, the weight on the euro rises
almost to .9, with perhaps bit parts assigned to the dollar and pound. Malta is one of the
ten countries that joined the EU in 2005 and one of two that join the euro in 2008.
The Norwegian krone (Table 2.11) is one of the few basket peggers in the
developed world. The estimates show heavy intervention, though the R2 never crosses .8.
The weights are initially .3 on the dollar and .4 on European currencies (and perhaps a
little weight on the yen and pound). But the weight on the European currencies rises at
the expense of the dollar, until the latter part of the sample period shows full weight on
the euro and none on the dollar. Table 3.8 uses the world oil price as the instrumental
variable for exchange market pressure, with results similar to OLS.
Table 2.12 refers to Papua New Guinea. In 2004-07 the flexibility coefficient for
the kina falls to zero and the R2 rises to .97, suggesting a tight peg. The peg is to the US
dollar. (The only other currency ever to receive significant weight is the Australian
dollar, during 1992-95.) Table 3.9 uses prices of gold, copper, oil, gas and timber as
instrumental variables. The only qualitative change relative to OLS is a fall in the
estimated flexibility parameters in 1996-2003
The Russian rouble (Table 2.13) shows high intervention from the beginning.
There is evidence of an attempt to stabilize around the dollar during 1996-2003, but the
peg is loose; this no doubt reflects both the discrete devaluation of 1998 and the band that
preceded it. More recently, the rouble has acted more like a basket peg, and has assigned
somewhat less weight to the dollar. In table 3.10, which uses the oil price as the
instrumental variable, the flexibility parameter in the current decade drops more rapidly
than under OLS.
The Seychelles rupee (Table 2.14) confirms its official classification as a basket
pegger, particularly in 1984-1995: not only is the flexibility coefficient essentially zero,
but the R2 exceeds .97. The estimated weights are .4 on the dollar, .3 on the European
currencies, .2 on the yen, and .1 on the pound. After 2004, however, the weight on the
dollar suddenly shoots up to .9 .

17

Table 2.15 reports the estimation for Thailand. The authorities are seen to have
intervened heavily in the 1980s and 1990s. During 1988-1995 they indeed adhered to a
very tight basket peg (R2=.999). The weight on the dollar reached .75-.88, but there was
still a significant weight of .1 on the yen. That the weight on the dollar falls short of 1.0
may come as a surprise to those who, in the wake of the Thai crisis of 1997, received the
impression that the baht had been explicitly pegged to the dollar. But the official policy
had been a basket peg, not a dollar peg. In the early 1990s, observers had been surprised
that the estimated weight on the dollar was so high, because the earlier orthodoxy had
been that Southeast Asia was rapidly becoming a yen bloc.18 The flexibility parameter
rises sharply in 2000-2007, though there is still plenty of intervention.19 Table 3.11 uses
the price of rice as an instrumental variable. Once again the point estimates of the
flexibility parameter rise, but the significance levels fall.
Vanuatu (2.16) shows relatively low exchange rate flexibility and a fairly close fit.
This is another official basket pegger. The estimates suggest roughly comparable
weights on the dollar, yen, euro and pound. On a priori grounds, the Australian and New
Zealand dollars ought to be added the equation.
Finally, Western Samoa (Table 2.17) shows heavy intervention during the first
three sub-periods, around a basket that weights the dollar most and the yen second (and
possibly the pound third). After 1992, however, there is more flexibility. The weights in
the reference basket during 2000-2003 are similar to the earlier period, except that the
euro now receives a large significant weight (.4). Table 3.12 uses the price of coconuts
as an instrumental variable. Again flexibility parameter estimates rise, but significance
levels generally fall.
We now turn to a set of floaters.
The estimated equation for the Australian dollar is reported in Table 2.18. The
coefficient on Exchange Market Pressure shows a lower degree of exchange rate
flexibility than one would have expected, given that the currency is thought to have
floated fairly freely throughout this period. The problem may be that reserves are
measured as more variable than seems right. Or the problem may be endogeneity of the
Exchange Market Pressure variable. The Australian dollar is considered a commodity
currency, so world commodity prices are a natural instrumental variable to correct for
endogeneity. Table 3.18 reports the IV estimation for Australia. For each of the subperiods the estimated flexibility coefficient is higher than it was under OLS, but they
remain surprisingly low in magnitude and statistical significance.
As noted in the discussion of Table 2, there is a good argument, in the definition
of Exchange Market Pressure, for computing the changes in reserves as a percentage of
the monetary base, rather than as a percentage of the level of reserves itself. Table 4.14
18

Frankel (1993), Frankel and Wei (1994), and references cited therein.
Very high multicollinearity between the US dollar and the Malaysian ringgit impedes the
estimation. The won, Australiian dollar, and ringgit probably ought to be dropped on a priori
grounds.
19

18

uses the alternative definition of Exchange Market Pressure (EMP), with changes in
reserves expressed as percentages of the Monetary Base:
{emp(t+s)-emp(t)} ≡ {[logH(t+s)-logH (t)] + log[Res(t+s)-logRes(t)]/MB(t)}.
As before, a coefficient of ß=1 would means that the currency floats purely, because
there are no changes in reserves) and ß=0 would means the exchange rate is fixed. Now
the estimated coefficient and significance level on the EMP variable are higher. This
tends to confirm the value of this approach, as Australia is known to be a floater. Table
5.18 applies instrumental variables to this same alternate definition of Exchange Market
Pressure, but it is little changed from IV with the first EMP definition.
The Canadian dollar (Table 2.19) shows up as mostly flexible, though
experiencing some intervention (the EMP coefficient ranges from .1 to .4), with the US
dollar usually receiving the largest weight in the basket that the authorities are treated as
implicitly using as a reference. As with Australia, the other rich commodity-exporting
floater, the IV estimates show estimates of the flexibility parameter in each sub-period
that are higher than they were under OLS, but that are surprisingly insignificant
statistically. Again, when we switch to the alternative definition of Exchange Market
Pressure, with reserve changes expressed as a percentage of the monetary base (Table
4.15), the coefficient estimates and significance levels of exchange market pressure are
generally a bit higher, as is consistent with the floating nature of the Canadian dollar.
Table 2.20 looks at the Mexican peso. It shows a significant downward crawl
throughout (until 2004), but it shows a peg to the dollar that is otherwise quite tight in
1988-91. Flexibility increases after the mid-point of the sample, which happens to be the
peso crisis years of 1994-95. The flexibility parameter does not climb out of the
range .3-.4, indicating that reserve changes have remained substantial during the latter
three sub-periods, when the peso was supposedly floating. One likely explanation is that
many monthly increases in reserves are associated with revenue earned by PEMEX oil
exports which the authorities leave in the form of dollar deposits, but which are not
conventionally considered foreign exchange intervention. Table 3.20, using the oil price
as an instrumental variable, again finds flexibility parameters estimated higher, but lower
in significance.
Table 2.21 reports estimation for Indonesia. The rupiah exhibits a downward
trend throughout. Otherwise, the estimates show great rigidity in 1992-95, followed by a
large leap in flexibility beginning in the late 1990s, at the time of the East Asia crisis.
Like some other Asian countries, Indonesia’s flexibility parameter comes back down in
2004-07 (“fear of floating”). Table 3.21 uses world prices of oil and natural gas as the
instrumental variable, but little is learned.
Extensions
In various extensions of the basic analysis, we have also:
1. allowed coefficients to vary over time, even within the four-year sub-samples ;

19

2. relaxed the constraint that {[logH(t+s)-logH (t)] and [ logRes(t+s)-logRes(t)]} enter
with the same coefficient ;
3. entered the change in the interest rate alongside the change in reserves and the change
in the exchange rate;
4. checked for robustness with respect to the numeraire unit used to define currency
values ; and
5. tried Monte Carlo studies on fabricated currencies (some constructed with the
monetary authorities leaning halfway against the wind of any fluctuations in EMP,
and others constrained more narrowly to remain within a 5% band) to see if the
technique is giving us the right answer.
The results in the extensions are generally in line with the results reported here.
Using a different numeraire does not make too much difference, for example.
Tables 6.1-6.10 report the extension that allows the coefficients to vary over time,
even within the sub-periods (extension 1, above). We expand the specification of (3) to
allow for trends in level and in the currency weights :
[Δ logH t - Δ log£t] = f(t)+ w(1) [Δ log $t - Δ log £t] + w(2) [Δ log €t - Δ log £t]
+ w(3) [Δ log ¥t - Δ log £t] + … + ß { Δ logEMP(t) } + u t
(4)
where f(t) = c0 + c1*t . The time-dependent weight terms can be defined either using
the exponential functional form for the weights w(j) so that they are automatically
bounded by 0 and 1 or, for simplicity, linearly: w(j) = b0(j) + b1(j)* t .
The case of most interest is probably China (2005-2007). There is no sign in this
monthly data of a downward trend in the coefficient on the dollar: the estimated trend
is .000. But there is a sign that the trend in the value of the yuan itself is rising over
time: since the the dependent variable is first differences, the statistically significant
coefficient on “t” indicates an upward acceleration. The other results are as before: zero
coefficients on non-dollar currencies are zero, zero coefficient on exchange market
pressure, and an R2 of 1.00, all of which indicate a simple dollar peg holding during most
of this period.
Tables 7.1-7.8 relax the constraint that {[logH(t+s)-logH (t)] and [ logRes(t+s)logRes(t)]} enter Exchange Market Pressure with the same coefficient (extension 2
above). The estimation takes into account that the variation of reserve changes is much
larger than the variation of exchange rate changes (as can be seen in Figure 1), so that
giving them equal weight means allowing the former to dominate in the estimates already
reported. We define the new EMP variable as :
Δ[logEMP] = {[varΔ[logEx]/ (varΔ[logEx]+ Var(Δ[logRes])}· Δ[logRes]
+ { Var(Δ[logRes]/ (varΔ[logEx]+ Var(Δ[logRes]) }·Δ[logEx]

(5)
And λ = var(Δ[logEx])/ Var(Δ[logRes])
Tables 8.1-8.5 broaden the definition of EMP another step (extension 3 above).
Here the change in the interest rate is entered alongside the change in reserves and the

20

change in the exchange rate, as three alternative ways that the authorities can respond to a
change in demand for their currency (Eichengreen, Rose, and Wyplosz, 1996). We
define the new EMP variable as :
Δ[logEMP] = {var(Δ[logEx])/ Var(Δ[logRes])}·Δ[logRes]
+Δ[logEx]
+ {var(Δ[logEx])/ Var(Δi)}·Δ i
λ = var(Δ[logEx])/ Var(Δ[logRes])
γ = var(Δ[logEx])/ Var(Δ[i])
That is, Δ[logEMP] = λ ·Δ[logRes]+ γ ·Δ i +Δ[logEx]

(6)

Table 9 checks whether the results are robust with respect to the choice of
numeraire, by using the Swiss franc as the standard by which currencies are valued, in
place of the SDR. The results are similar. The choice of numeraire does not appear to
make much difference.
The last tables report results from the Monte Carlo exercises. We construct
artificial exchange rate series under two regimes: managed float (Table 10.1 - 10.4) and
band (Table 10.5 - 10.8). In the former case we assume that a certain percentage of any
change in exchange market pressure is absorbed in reserves and the rest in the exchange
rate (“leaning against the wind”). In the latter case we restrict the width of the band or
target zone to plus or minus 2 and ½ per cent. Within the band we have tried a random
walk subject to the restriction that the exchange rate can’t wander outside the band. One
could consider other distributions. The Krugman theory of target zones provides a
precise mathematical specification for the distribution within the band ; but it assumes
unrealistically that there is no intervention inside the band (only at the margins) and also
that the band is 100% credible.
In each case we try one version where the central parity is a basket that puts 1/3
weight on the dollar, 1/3 on the euro and 1/3 on the yen, and we try another version
where the central parity is simply pegged to the dollar. In the estimation, we constrain
the weights to add to 1. Although the disturbances are drawn from a random normal
distribution, the magnitude (variance of the distribution) is drawn from real-world cases.
We try two such cases : we take the Canadian dollar’s parameters as representative of a
floating currency (a low-variance reserve case), and we take Papua New Guinea’s
parameters as representative of a high-variance (attributable to commodity exports) small
country with an intermediate regime.
In most cases, the estimates correspond well with the parameters that were built in.
For example, the difference between a band with sharp borders and a policy of
consistently leaning against the wind turns out to be not all that important. In every case,
the estimated weights are within one or two standard errors of 1/3-1/3-1/3 for the basket
case, and 1 for the dollar peg case. The technique tends to pick out the correct weights
even though it is not designed for the specific statistical distribution of a band. The
results are especially insensitive to the choice of numeraire, as between SDR and Swiss
Franc. This is reassuring, since previously we have had to rely on the a priori theorem
that the choice of numeraire makes no difference in the special case of a perfect peg.
The technique seems equally robust when estimating the parameter that represents the
degree of exchange rate flexibility.

21

Typical R2s tend to lie in the range .87-.89. Our conclusion is that the technique
works fairly well and robustly, when the true exchange rate regime is the one assumed (in
this case leaning against the wind, around either a basket or the dollar). The technique
may not always work as well in practice (of which one reflection may be lower R2s in
Tables 1-9), because in practice many countries do not in fact follow a regime such as a
basket band for more than a few years in a row, without devaluing or otherwise changing
the parameters. To allow for changes in parameters within the sample period one would
have to take the technique to the next stage of econometric sophisitication, and perhaps
suffer nonetheless from data frequency insufficient to produce reliable estimates.
Conclusion
Intermediate exchange rate regimes remain alive and well. Some countries have
announced basket regimes, often with an intermediate degree of flexibility that can be
captured by some combination of a crawl, a band, or leaning-against-the-wind
intervention. Most basket peggers keep the weights in the basket secret, which usually
means they want to preserve a degree of freedom from prying eyes (whether to pursue a
lower degree of de facto exchange rate flexibility, as with China, or a higher degree, as
with others).
The necessary task of distinguishing de facto from de jure exchange rate regimes
has produced an active recent sub-literature. But inferring de facto weights and inferring
de facto flexibility are equally important, whereas most authors have hitherto done only
one or the other. Thus the main contribution of this paper is to propose a synthesis
specification that allows estimation of true weights at the same time as estimation of the
true tendency of monetary authorities to allow exchange market pressure to show up in
the price, versus the quantity, of foreign exchange.
We have tried out the technique on some 20 currencies. The majority are
countries reported by the IMF to have declared the use of baskets. But we have also
included some floaters and some simple peggers. For the most part the synthesis
technique seems to work as it should. Known floaters tend to score much higher
flexibility parameters than known peggers, with the BBC countries in between. In some
cases, the inferred behavior differs in some way from the de jure regime. For example
China’s “basket” puts more weight on the dollar than the impression given by the
government, while other declared basket peggers are not as firmly tied to the basket as
they claim. Meanwhile, declared floaters often intervene heavily to dampen exchange
rate fluctuations (fear of floating), but sometimes with reference to an anchor that is not a
simple dollar parity as other authors may have assumed.

Notes:
1. The level of commodity prices (thought of as a determinant of the balance of payments) is used as instrumental
variables for the change in EMP
2. Commodity prices have been converted to SDR
3. The commodity prices have been deflated by the weighted world CPI:
we calculate the weighted CPI by using the weights and currencies that are used to define SDR, and have adjusted their
weights according to their evolution since 1980

Table 10: Extension 5
Monte Carlo Simulations
In this extension, we tried Monte Carlo studies on fabricated currencies -- some
constructed with the monetary authorities leaning halfway against the wind of any
fluctuations in EMP, and others constrained more narrowly to remain within a Plus and
minus 2.5% Band -- to see if the technique gives us the right answer.
We use the true path of the euro, dollar and yen (in SDR) over the last 8 years to make up
a currency (abbreviated as MCSA for Monte Carlo Simulation) with certain
configurations of weights, and then try to see if we can recover these weights with the
methodology introduced in this paper.
10.1 The case of leaning against the wind
10.1.1 Simulated currency MCSA computed as basket (with weights 1/3 euros, 1/3
dollars and 1/3 yen) valued with the SDR as numeraire:
Log[MCSA+ rw] =(log[jpy])/3+(log[eur])/3+(log[usd])/3
Note:
rw is a random walk variable which is defined as:
rw(t)= rw(t-1)+ a
a is a normally distributed random variable and a～N(0, 0.03)
We use the true variance of EMP drawn from some real countries, choosing two
representatives: a high variance case from a commodity producer (PNG) and a lowvariance case (CAD).
