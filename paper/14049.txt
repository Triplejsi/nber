An Anatomy Of Credit Booms: Evidence From Macro Aggregates And Micro Data

NBER Working Paper No. 14049

JEL No. E32,E44,E51,F3,G21
ABSTRACT
This paper proposes a methodology for measuring credit booms and uses it to identify credit booms
in emerging and industrial economies over the past four decades. In addition, we use event study methods
to identify the key empirical regularities of credit booms in macroeconomic aggregates and micro-level
data. Macro data show a systematic relationship between credit booms and economic expansions, rising
asset prices, real appreciations, widening external deficits and managed exchange rates. Micro data
show a strong association between credit booms and firm-level measures of leverage, firm values,
and external financing, and bank-level indicators of banking fragility. Credit booms in industrial and
emerging economies show three major differences: (1) credit booms and the macro and micro fluctuations
associated with them are larger in emerging economies, particularly in the nontradables sector; (2)
not all credit booms end in financial crises, but most emerging markets crises were associated with
credit booms; and (3) credit booms in emerging economies are often preceded by large capital inflows
but not by financial reforms or productivity gains.

Introduction
Episodes in which credit to the private sector rises significantly above its long-run

trend (i.e. “credit booms”) are often associated with periods of economic turbulence. To
date, however, efforts at developing methodologies for identifying credit booms and
characterizing the economic fluctuations that accompany them have produced mixed
results. In addition, little is known about the association between economy-wide credit
booms and the financial conditions of individual firms and banks, and about whether the
characteristics of credit booms differ across industrial and emerging economies.
In this paper, we propose a “thresholds method” for identifying credit booms, and
implement it to study the microeconomic and macroeconomic characteristics of credit
booms in industrial and emerging economies. This method splits real credit per capita in
each country into its cyclical and trend components, and identifies a credit boom as an
episode in which credit exceeds its long-run trend by more than a given “boom”
threshold, with the duration of the boom set by “starting” and “ending” thresholds. A key
feature of this method is that boom and duration thresholds are proportional to each
country’s standard deviation of credit over the business cycle. Hence, credit booms
reflect country-specific “unusually large” cyclical credit expansions.
We apply our method to data for 48 countries over the 1960-2006 period and find 27
credit booms in industrial countries and 22 in emerging economies. We then take the
peak dates of these booms and construct seven-year event windows around them to
examine the dynamics of macro aggregates and firm- and bank-level financial indicators
during credit booms. The results show that credit booms are associated with periods of
economic expansion, rising equity and housing prices, real appreciation and widening

1

external deficits in the build-up phase of the booms, followed by the opposite dynamics
in the downswing. Credit booms also feature similar pro-cyclical movements in firmlevel indicators of leverage, firm values, and use of external financing, and in bank-level
indicators of credit issuance and asset returns. The banks’ ratios of capital adequacy and
non-performing loans show the opposite pattern (rising in the upswing and falling in the
aftermath). Moreover, credit booms tend to be synchronized internationally and centered
on “big events” like the 1980s debt crisis, the 1992 ERM crisis, and the 1990s Sudden
Stops in emerging economies. In addition, splitting our sample into financial crisis vs.
non-crisis cases, we find that booms in the crisis group were larger.
Credit booms in industrial and emerging economies differ in three key respects: First,
the fluctuations that macro aggregates and micro indicators display during credit booms
are larger, more persistent, and asymmetric in emerging economies, and this pattern is
particularly strong in the nontradables sector. Second, not all credit booms end in crisis,
but many of the recent emerging market crises were associated with credit booms. Third,
the frequency of credit booms in emerging markets is higher when preceded by periods of
large capital inflows but not when preceded by domestic financial reforms or gains in
total factor productivity (TFP), while industrial countries show the opposite pattern
(credit booms are more frequent after periods of high TFP or financial reforms, and less
frequent after large capital inflows). In contrast, credit booms in both industrial and
emerging economies are far more frequent in the presence of fixed or managed exchange
rates, than under floating or dirty floating regimes.
Our work is related to the empirical literature that identifies booms in macro variables
using threshold methods and event-study techniques. Montiel’s (2000) analysis of

2

consumption booms was one of the first studies in this vein. Gourinchas, Valdes, and
Landerretche (2001), henceforth GVL, introduced threshold methods to the analysis of
credit booms, followed by several recent studies including Cottarelli, et. al. (2003),
International Monetary Fund (2004), Hilberts, et. al. (2005), and Ottens, et. al. (2005).1
The majority of these studies measure credit booms using GVL’s method. There are
three important differences between their method and the one we propose in this paper:
(1) we use real credit per capita instead of the credit-output ratio as the measure of credit;
(2) we construct the trend of credit using the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter in its standard
form, instead of using an “expanding HP trend” (see Section 2 for details); and (3) we use
thresholds that depend on each country’s cyclical variability of credit, instead of a
threshold common to all countries.2
These differences have major quantitative implications. An example of both methods
applied to Chilean data shows that the GVL method is not robust to the choice of credit
measure, and that it treats each period’s credit observation as unduly representative of its
trend (because it models the long-run trend of credit as a smoothed, lagged approximation
of the actual data). Moreover, the two methods yield sharply different predictions about
the association between macro variables and credit booms. In particular, we find that
output, consumption and investment rise significantly above trend during the
expansionary phase of credit booms, and fall below trend during the contractionary
phase. In contrast, GVL found weak evidence of cycles in output and absorption
associated with credit booms. We also find a clear association between credit booms and
1

Other studies examine linkages between credit and macro variables without measuring credit booms (for
example Collyns and Senhadji (2002), Borio, et. al. (2001), and Kraft and Jankov (2005)).
2
Our study also differs from GVL’s in that we examine credit booms in industrial countries, study
differences in the dynamics of the tradables v. nontradables sectors, and contrast the macro dynamics of
credit booms with evidence from micro-level data.

3

financial crises, while they found that the likelihood of financial crises does not increase
significantly when credit booms are present.
Our work is also related to the analysis of the credit transmission channel in twin
banking-currency crises by Tornell and Westermann (2005).3 These authors document
that twin crises are preceded by rising credit-GDP ratios, increases in output of
nontradables relative to tradables, and real appreciations, followed by declines in all of
these variables. In addition, they used the World Bank’s World Business Economic
Survey (WBES) to document asymmetries in the access to credit markets of firms in the
tradables v. non-tradables sectors. We also look at sectoral differences in the evolution of
output dynamics and firm-level financial indicators, but our approach differs in that we
examine these dynamics conditional on credit boom episodes, rather than conditional on
being on a twin-crises event. Also, we use actual balance-sheet and cash-flow-statement
data to measure firm-level financial indicators for all publicly listed corporations, instead
of using the survey data of more limited coverage in the WBES.
Our frequency analysis of the association of credit booms with capital inflows,
financial reforms, and TFP gains is related to theoretical and empirical studies on the
mechanisms that drive credit booms. These include theories in which excessive credit
expansion is due to herding behavior by banks (Kindleberger (2000)); information
problems that lead to bank-interdependent lending policies (Rajan (1994) and Gorton and
He (2005)), the underestimation of risks (Borio, et. al. (2001)) and the lowering of
lending standards (Dell’Ariccia and Marquez (2006)); the presence of explicit or implicit
government guarantees (Corsetti, et. al. (1999)); or limited commitment on the part of

middle income countries during tranquil times. See also Scheneider and Tornell (2004).

borrowers (Lorenzoni (2005)). Similarly, our analysis of the connection between credit
booms and macroeconomic activity is related to the literature on business cycle models
that incorporate “financial accelerators,” by which shocks to asset prices and relative
good prices are amplified through balance sheet effects (see, for example, Fisher (1933),
Bernanke and Gertler (1989), Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist (1999), Kiyotaki and
Moore (1997), and Mendoza (2005) and (2006)).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes our method for
identifying credit booms, implements it on a sample of 49 countries, and examines the
main characteristics of credit booms in industrial and emerging economies. Sections 3
and 4 study the credit-boom dynamics of macro aggregates and micro-level data,
respectively. Section 5 concludes.

Credit Booms: Methodology and Key Features

2.1

Methodology
A credit boom is defined in general as an episode in which credit to the private sector

grows by more than during a typical business cycle expansion. We formalize this
definition as follows. Denote the deviation from the long-run trend in the logarithm of
real credit per capita in country i, date t as lit, and the corresponding standard deviation of
this cyclical component as σ (li ) . The long-run trend is calculated using the HodrickPrescott (HP) filter with the smoothing parameter set at 100, as is typical for annual data.
Country i is defined to have experienced a credit boom when we identify one or more
contiguous dates for which the credit boom condition li ,t ≥ φσ (li ) holds, where φ is the

boom threshold factor. Thus, during a credit boom the deviations from trend in credit
exceed the typical expansion of credit over the business cycle by a factor of φ or more.

5

We used a baseline value of φ = 1.75, and conducted sensitivity analysis for φ = 1.5, 2
(which confirmed that our main results are robust to the value of φ).
The date of the peak of the credit boom ( tˆ ) is the date that shows the maximum
difference between lit and φ σ (li ) from the set of contiguous dates that satisfy the credit

boom condition. Given tˆ , the starting date of the credit boom is a date ts such that ts < tˆ
and ts yields the smallest difference | li ,t − φ sσ (li ) | , and the ending date te is a date te > tˆ
that yields the smallest difference | li ,t − φ eσ (li ) | , where φs and φe are the start and end
thresholds.4 We use baseline values φs=φe =1, and we also tried other values including 0,
¼, ½ and ¾.5 Once the starting and ending dates are set, the duration of the credit boom is
given by the difference te – ts.
2.2

Credit boom episodes and their main features
We use data on credit from the financial sector to the private non-financial sector

obtained from the IMF’s International Financial Statistics for a sample of 49 countries,
21 industrial and 28 emerging economies (see Appendix 1), for the 1960-2006 period.
Our measure of credit is the sum of claims on the private sector by deposit money banks
(IFS line 22d) plus, whenever available for the entire sample period for a given country,
claims on the private sector by other financial institutions (IFS line 42d). Because credit
is a year-end stock variable that we are going to compare with flow variables like output
and expenditures, real credit per capita is calculated as the average of two contiguous
end-of-year observations of nominal credit per capita deflated by their corresponding

4

These threshold conditions are set to minimize the absolute values of differences of lit relative to targets
because the data are discrete, and hence in general lit does not match the targets with equality.
5
We use thresholds such that φs =φe < φ, but notice that in principle φs and φe could differ, and one or both
could be set equal to φ.

end-of-year consumer price index. Data sources for these and all other variables used in
the paper are listed in Appendix 2.
We identified 49 credit booms in our data, 27 in industrial countries and 22 in
emerging economies.6 Figure 1 provides a summary view of these credit booms by
plotting the cross-country mean and median of the cyclical components of real credit per
capita in seven-year event windows centered at the peak of credit booms for the two
groups of countries. These graphs show that credit booms in emerging economies are
larger than in industrial countries in absolute terms: At the peak of the booms, the
average expansion in real credit per capita reached almost 30 percent above trend in
emerging economies, twice what is observed in industrial countries. In relative terms
(i.e. in multiples of the standard deviation of credit in each country), however, credit
booms in industrial countries are similar to those in emerging economies (see Figure 2).
This is because the cyclical variability of credit is larger in the latter.
Table 1 shows the duration of credit booms for different starting and ending
thresholds, and the length of the corresponding upswing and downswing phases. In
general, the results based on medians indicate that EMs and ICs show booms with
similar duration of about 6-7, years and upswings that last longer than downswings.
Using means, however, EMs seem to show longer and more asymmetric booms, but this
result is driven largely by the countries that experienced Sudden Stops.
Credit booms tend to be clustered geographically and not limited to a single region:
40 percent of the booms experienced by emerging economies were observed in East Asia
and 32 percent in Latin America. Likewise, 33 percent of the credit booms in industrial
6

There are also four emerging economies (India, South Africa, Turkey, and Venezuela) that were identified
as experiencing credit booms in 2006, the end of the sample period, but they were excluded from the event
analysis because they have yet to be completed (i.e. the ending thresholds have yet to be crossed).

7

countries were observed in the G7 and 18 percent in the Nordic countries (Denmark,
Finland, Norway, and Sweden). In addition, Figure 3 shows that credit booms tend to be
synchronized internationally and centered around big events—e.g. the Bretton Woods
collapse of the early 1970s, the petro dollars boom in the prelude to the 1980s debt crisis,
the ERM and Nordic country crises of the early 1990s, and the recent Sudden Stops. The
Figure also suggests that the frequency of credit booms in industrial countries seems to
have declined over time, but this may in fact reflect the pattern of financial deepening
away from banks and into non-bank financial intermediaries, rather than an actual
reduction in the occurrence of credit booms.7 A credit boom driven by non-bank
financial intermediaries would not be captured in the IFS data that we used. 8
2.3

Differences with the method of Gourinchas, Valdes and Landerretche
As noted in the Introduction, several recent studies of credit booms use the thresholds

method proposed by GVL, but their method yields results that differ markedly from ours.
Hence, it is important to explain why the two methodologies produce different results.
Both methods are threshold methods: They define credit booms by identifying periods in
which credit is deemed to have expanded “too much” relative to a long-run trend.
However, the two methods differ in three key respects:
(1)

Measure of credit: We use real credit per capita, while GVL use the ratio of
nominal credit to nominal GDP. The latter has three limitations. One is that it
does not allow for the possibility that credit and output could have different
trends, which is important if countries are undergoing a process of financial

7

For example, Rajan (2005) argues that technical change, deregulation, and institutional change have
resulted in an increasing number of arm’s length transactions away from banks in the financial system.
8
Indeed, the growing securitization of subprime mortgages in the United States in recent years was
accompanied by an increase in the off-balance sheet operations of bank entities.

8

deepening, or if for other reasons the trend of GDP and that of credit are
progressing at different rates. Second, there can be situations when both nominal
credit and GDP are falling and yet the ratio increases because GDP falls more
rapidly. Lastly, when inflation is high, the fluctuations of the credit to GDP ratio
could be misleading because of improper price adjustments.
(2)

Detrending procedure: We detrend the credit data using a standard application of
the HP filter to our full sample period 1960-2006 with the value of the HP
smoothing parameter commonly used with annual data (100). In contrast, GVL
used an expanding HP trend with a smoothing parameter of 1000. This expanding
trend extends the sample over which the trend is computed by one year as each
successive year in the sample is added (see Appendix 3 for details).

(3)

Definition of thresholds: Our thresholds are defined as multiples of the countryspecific standard deviation of credit over the business cycle, which changes the
threshold level of credit needed to define a boom (i.e. the product φσ (li ) ) with
each country’s cyclical variability of credit. This ensures that a credit boom is a
situation in which the deviation from trend in credit is “unusually large” relative
to a country’s typical credit cycle. In contrast, GVL use a boom threshold that is
invariant across countries, regardless of whether it represents a small or large
change relative to a country’s historical cyclical variability of credit.
These differences have significant quantitative implications. To illustrate these

differences, we apply the two methods to the case of Chile, which is also the case that
GVL used to illustrate their method. Figure 4 shows the results of applying our method to
Chilean data. Panel 1 shows results using our method exactly as described in 2.1. It

9

shows the actual data for the log of real credit per capita, the HP trend, and the boom and
start/end thresholds.9 Panel 2 changes the smoothing parameter from 100 to the value
used by GVL (1000). Panel 3 changes the measure of credit from real credit per capita to
GVL’s ratio of credit to GDP. Panel 4 changes both the smoothing parameter and the
definition of credit for the ones used in GVL, but retains our country-specific thresholds.
Our baseline results in Panel 1 indicate that Chile experienced a credit boom that
peaked in 1981 and lasted five years (from 1979 to 1983). Panel 3 shows that if we use
the credit-GDP ratio as the measure of credit, the boom peaks in 1984 and also lasts five
years (from 1981 to 1985). Thus, under our method the choice of credit variable affects
the timing of the boom but not its duration. In contrast, Panels 2 and 4 show that
increasing the smoothing parameter from 100 to 1000 affects the timing of the boom, and
increases both the size of its peak and its duration. This occurs because a larger
smoothing parameter produces a smoother trend with larger and more persistent
deviations from trend.
Figure 5 conducts a similar experiment as Figure 4 but now starting in Panel 1 with
the results produced by applying the GVL method as proposed in their paper. Panel 2
lowers the smoothing parameter to 100. Panel 3 changes the measure of credit from the
credit-GDP ratio to real credit per capita. Panel 4 changes both the measure of credit and
the smoothing parameter to the ones we used, but retains the country-invariant threshold
proposed by GVL.
The results in Panel 1 of Figure 5 are nearly identical to those obtained by GVL (see
Figure 2b in their paper), confirming that our implementation of their methodology is
accurate. The GVL method indicates that Chile experienced a credit boom that peaked in
9

We set the start and end thresholds equal to 1.

10

1982 and lasted fourteen years (from 1971 to 1984).10 Panels 3 and 4 show that if we
change the credit measure to real credit per capita, the GVL method cannot identify a
credit boom in Chile in the sample period, regardless of the value of the smoothing
parameter. This is because deviations from trend in real credit per capita at least as large
as 19.5 percent were not observed in Chile, and indeed are extremely large relative to the
Chilean history of deviations from trend in real credit per capita. In contrast, our method
adjusts the boom threshold to the observed country cyclical variability of credit. As a
result, our methodology is robust to the choice of measuring credit in real per capita
terms v. as a share of GDP.
Panel 2 of Figure 5 shows that when the expanding HP trend is calculated using a
smoothing parameter equal to 100, the GVL method does identify a credit boom in the
early 1980s, but one that lasted only three years instead of fourteen—again because a
larger smoothing parameter produces a smoother trend with larger and more persistent
deviations from trend. Thus, the higher smoothing parameter used in GVL’s calculations
is the key factor behind the long duration of the credit boom they identified (compare
Panels 1 and 2).
One key additional feature that affects the quantitative implications of the two
methods is that the expanding trend with high smoothing parameter of the GVL method
results in a trend that approximates a smoothed version of the actual time series of credit
with some lag (see Figure 6). The standard HP trend used in our method and GVL’s
expanding HP trend are very similar at the beginning and at the end of the sample, but in
most of the “internal” periods (and particularly during the period of fast credit growth)
10

GVL dated the peak in the same year and found the boom to be of about the same magnitude, but
estimated its duration at 10 years. This difference is due to the longer sample in our data (which ends in
2006 instead of 1996), and because of data revisions in the credit-to-GDP data relative to our sample.

11

the expanding trend resembles a smoothed lagged transformation of the data. Hence, in
these periods the expanding trend treats actual observations of high credit-GDP ratios as
being largely part of the long-run trend of credit, when in reality they are not.

Credit Booms and Macroeconomic Dynamics

This Section examines the business cycle behavior of the economy during credit
boom events, and conducts a frequency analysis of the association between credit booms
and financial crises, and between credit booms and some of their potential determinants.
3.1

Event analysis
We construct seven-year event windows of the cyclical components of macro

aggregates centered on the peak of credit booms (i.e. tˆ is normalized to date t=0). The
windows show the cross-country means and medians of output (Y), private consumption
(C), public consumption (G), investment (I), the output of nontradables (YN), the real
exchange rate (RER), the current account-output ratio (CAY) and total capital inflows as
share of output (KI). All these variables are at constant prices, expressed in per-capita
terms and detrended with the HP filter setting the smoothing parameter at 100, except for
RER (which is not in per-capita terms) and the current account-output and capital
inflows-output ratios (which are at current prices and not expressed in per capita terms).11
Figures 7-10 illustrate business cycle dynamics around credit boom episodes in
emerging and industrial economies. Except for RER and KI, there is little difference in
the dynamics produced by country means and medians, indicating that the results are not
driven by outliers. Consider first the plots for emerging economies in the right-side of the
Figures. Y, C and G rise 2 to 4 percentage points above trend in the build up phase of the

11

Due to data limitations we exclude Jordan from the event analysis.

12

credit boom, and drop to between 3 to 4 percent below trend in the recessive phase. I, YN
and RER follow a similar pattern but display significantly larger expansions and
recessions. Investment rises up to 18 percent above trend at t=-1 and drops below trend
by a similar amount by t=2. YN rises to about 6½ percent above trend by t=0 and then
drops to almost 3 percent below trend by t=3. The median RER appreciates 9 percent
above trend at t=-1, and drops to a low of about 4 percent below trend when the credit
boom unwinds. CAY displays the opposite pattern: it declines to a deficit of about 2½
percentage points of GDP in the expanding phase of the boom and then rises to a surplus
of 1½ percentage points of GDP in the declining phase. In line with these current account
dynamics, KI rises by up to 3½ percentage points of GDP by t=-1 and then drops by 2¼
percentage points of GDP by t=3.
The plots for industrial countries in the left-side panels of Figures 7-10 show several
similarities with those for emerging economies, but also some important differences.
Output, expenditures and the current account in the industrial countries follow a cyclical
pattern similar to that observed in the emerging economies, but the amplitude of these
fluctuations is smaller, and government consumption shows the opposite pattern (slightly
below trend in the expanding phase and slightly above trend in the contraction phase).
Two important caveats apply to the event study graphs. First, they illustrate the
cyclical dynamics of macro variables, but do not show if these variables themselves are
undergoing a boom (i.e. an unusually large expansion as defined by our thresholds
method). Table 2 provides evidence to examine this issue by listing the fraction of credit
booms associated with booms in output and expenditures that occur in any year inside the
seven-year window of the credit boom events. The results show that between 30 to 60

13

percent of the credit booms are associated with booms in Y, YN, C, I, and G, and this
holds for emerging and industrial countries, as well as for all the countries together.
The second caveat of the event study graphs is that they show point estimates of
measures of central tendency (means and medians), but do not demonstrate if these
moments are statistically significant. To explore this issue, we run cross-section
regressions of each macro variable for each date of the event window on a constant. The
standard error for the median (mean) is obtained using quintile (OLS) regressions. As
Table 3 shows, the majority of the mean and median estimates shown in the event study
plots for Y, YN, C, and I are statistically significant at the 1 percent confidence level for
industrial and emerging economies. For G, RER and CA/Y, however, many of the
coefficients have large standard errors.
Another potential caveat of the event analysis is that the relationships it captures
between credit booms and macro variables may not be particular to credit booms, but
may reflect overall business cycle patterns. In particular, one could ask if the results
would be any different if instead of identifying credit booms and using them to condition
the event analysis, we were to identify output booms and use them as the conditioning
variable (defining output booms with the same thresholds method we applied for credit
booms). We explored this possibility by constructing seven-year event windows of
fluctuations in macro variables (including private sector credit) centered on the peak
dates of output booms. In the case of the emerging economies, there is no discernible
cyclical pattern in the behavior of credit. Thus, there is an output cycle associated with
credit booms, but there is no credit cycle associated with output booms. For industrial
countries, we found that there is a cyclical pattern in the behavior of credit during output

14

booms, but one that is much less pronounced than during credit booms, and some features
of the boom-bust dynamics we identified during credit booms are not present during
output booms (housing prices, in particular, do not fall in the aftermath of output booms).
We now study the behavior of inflation, equity prices and housing prices during credit
booms (see Figure 11). Industrial countries show negligible changes in inflation, and
rising (falling) equity and housing prices in the build up (declining) phase of credit
booms. In emerging economies, inflation tends to spike after the credit booms peak, but
this result is driven by outliers because the mean inflation at t=1 exceeds the median
inflation by a large margin. The median inflation rises only 2 percent above trend. Hence,
credit booms are generally not associated with surges in inflation in either industrial or
emerging economies. Stock and housing prices show the same pattern in emerging
economies as in industrial countries, but note that the rise in equity prices in the upswing
and the decline in housing prices in the downswing are larger in the former.
The event windows for industrial and emerging economies mask important variations
across country regions. In industrial countries, the Nordic countries show larger
fluctuations in credit and in the macro variables than the G7 (Table 4, Panel A). In
addition, some of the macro variables in the Nordic countries peak earlier than credit. In
the case of the emerging economies (Table 4, Panel B), output and investment
fluctuations in Asia and Latin America are similar, but credit expansions and the
fluctuations in consumption are much larger in the latter. In contrast, the current account
reversals when the credit booms revert are larger in Asia.
In summary, the macro event study shows that credit booms across emerging and
industrial economies are associated with a well-defined pattern of economic expansion in

15

the build-up phase of the booms, followed by contraction in the declining phase. Output,
expenditures, stock prices, housing prices, and the real exchange rate move above trend
in the first phase, and drop below trend in the second phase, and the current account falls
first and then rises. All of this happens without major changes in inflation. Beyond these
similarities, credit booms in emerging and industrial economies differ in four key
respects: (1) the amplitude of the macroeconomic fluctuations is smaller in industrial
countries; (2) government consumption in industrial countries fluctuates very little and
shows the opposite pattern of that in emerging economies; (3) the current account-output
ratio and the (median) capital inflows-output ratio also display smaller changes in
industrial countries, and their timing differs sharply (CAY does not hit its trough in the
build up phase of the credit boom); and (4) fluctuations in the nontradables sector of
industrial countries are much smaller, and RER actually depreciates slightly, instead of
appreciating sharply, in the expansionary phase of credit booms.
These differences in the macro features of credit booms across industrial and
emerging economies are consistent with three well-known facts in international business
cycle studies: First, the larger amplitude of the fluctuations displayed by emerging
economies is in line with well-established evidence showing that business cycles are
larger in developing countries (see Mendoza (1995), Kose, Prasad and Terrones (2003),
Neumeyer and Perri (2005)). Second, the striking difference in the behavior of
government purchases is consistent with the evidence produced in the literature on the
procyclicality of fiscal policy in developing countries (see Kaminski, Reinhart, and Vegh
(2005)). Third, the widening current account deficits followed by reversals, and the
booms followed by collapses in the price and output of the nontradables sector, are

16

consistent with observations highlighted in the Sudden Stops literature (e.g. Calvo
(1998), Mendoza (2007), Caballero and Krishnamurty (2001)). However, it is important
to note that generally these facts have been documented by examining macroeconomic
data without conditioning for credit booms. In contrast, our results apply specifically to
fluctuations associated with credit boom episodes. This is particularly relevant for the
Sudden Stop facts (i.e. the reversals in CAY and the boom-bust cycles in RER and YN),
because most of the Sudden Stops literature emphasizes the role of credit transmission
mechanisms in explaining Sudden Stops.
Our finding that credit booms are associated with a well-defined cyclical pattern in
output and expenditures contrasts sharply with the findings of GVL showing only
ambiguous evidence of this association. Figure 6 in their paper shows a small cycle in
GDP, a decline in GDP growth below trend for the entire duration of credit booms, and
no cycle in consumption.
3.3

Frequency analysis
We conduct next a frequency analysis to examine three issues: (1) the association

between credit booms and financial crises; (2) the role of capital inflows, productivity
gains, financial reforms and exchange rate regimes as preconditions of credit booms; and
(3) the probability of experiencing a credit boom once the starting threshold is crossed.
Credit booms are often cited as the culprit behind financial crises, particularly in
emerging economies (see Eichengreen and Arteta, 2002). If this is the case, credit booms
should be closely associated with financial crises. Table 5 shows the percent of banking
crises, currency crises and Sudden Stops that occurred during the seven-year window of
the credit boom events in emerging economies, industrial countries and all countries

17

combined. The percent of crises that occurred before, after and at the peak of the credit
booms are listed in separate columns. The dates identifying the occurrence of these crises
were obtained from sources in the empirical literature (Demirguic-Kunt and Detragiache
(2006) for banking crises, Eichengreen and Bordo (2002) for currency crises, and Calvo,
Izquierdo, and Mejia (2004) for Sudden Stops).
Table 5 yields an important result: Credit booms in emerging economies are often
associated with currency crises, banking crises, and Sudden Stops. About 68 percent of
the credit booms in emerging economies are associated with currency crises, 55 percent
with banking crises, and 32 percent with Sudden Stops. Most of these crises either
preceded or coincided with the peak of the credit booms, suggesting that many of the
booms ended after a country suffered a crisis. These findings are also at odds with the
conclusion in GVL suggesting that there is virtually no association between credit booms
and financial crises in emerging economies.
Table 5 also shows that, contrary to what we found in emerging economies, credit
booms in industrial countries are only occasionally associated with banking and currency
crises, and there is no association with Sudden Stops. Moreover, industrial countries in a
credit boom are more likely to experience currency crises than banking crises. The
combined frequency of currency crises before, after or at the peak of credit booms is
slightly over 50 percent, while that for banking crises is 15 percent. In contrast with the
emerging economies, currency crises are more frequent after the peak of credit booms.
We also constructed seven-year event windows that compare the fluctuations in credit
and macro aggregates of countries that experienced a crisis (i.e. banking crisis, currency
crisis, or Sudden Stop) with those that did not. The results (available from the authors on

18

request) show clearly that the macro fluctuations in the countries that experienced crisis
are larger and display more abrupt declines than those of the non-crisis countries.
Consider now the frequency analysis of the association between credit booms and
large capital inflows, financial reforms, and TFP gains. Capital inflows are measured as
gross liability flows (i.e. foreign direct investment, portfolio flows, and other investments
liabilities) in percent of GDP, using data from IFS (see Appendix 2). We define a state of
large capital inflows as of date t when the preceding three-year average of capital inflows
ranked on the top quartile of its respective country group (i.e. emerging markets,
industrial countries, or both) over the 1975-2006 period.12 Domestic financial reforms are
measured using the index produced by Abiad, Detragiache, and Tressel (2007). This
index takes values between 0 and 21 and includes information on reserve requirements
and credit controls, interest rate controls, barriers to entry, state ownership, policies on
securities markets, banking regulation, and capital account restrictions. We identify a
country undertaking significant financial reforms as of date t if the preceding three-year
change in this index ranks on the top quartile of its respective country group over the
1975-2002 period. Our measure of TFP is based on standard growth accounting methods
(see, for instance, Klenow and Rodriguez (1997) and Kose, Prasad, and Terrones (2008)),
using labor and investment data from PWT 6.2. A country is identified to have
experienced high TFP growth as of date t if the preceding three-year average of TFP
growth ranked on the top quartile of its respective group over the 1975-2006 period.
Table 6 shows the fraction of credit booms preceded by large capital inflows,
domestic financial reforms, and large TFP gains. Because these factors are often
12

We focus on the preceding three-year average because we are interested in the role of capital inflows (as
well as TFP and financial reforms) as potential causes of credit booms, so we are interested in studying if
credit booms are preceded by these developments as a form of statistical causality.

19

interconnected and may interact with each other, we compute the frequency of credit
booms that coincided with each factor individually as well as jointly with pairs of two
factors or with all three factors together. For industrial countries, the results indicate that
40 percent of the credit booms followed large TFP gains and 33 percent followed
significant financial reforms. In contrast, in emerging economies we find that over 50
percent of credit booms were preceded by large capital inflows, while TFP gains and
financial reforms play a small role. Thus, credit booms in industrial countries are
preceded by TFP gains and/or domestic financial reforms and to a much lesser extent by
surges in capital inflows, while the opposite is observed in emerging economies.
Table 7 shows the results of a similar frequency analysis but now aimed at examining
the association between the peak of credit booms and the exchange rate regimes in place
the preceding three years. We use Reinhart and Rogoff’s (2004) classification of
exchange rate regimes to create the following four regime groupings: fixed and managed,
dirty floating, floating and mixed (see the footnote to Table 6 for details). The mixed
regime includes countries that switched across the other regimes in any of the three years
prior to the peak of the credit boom. The results shown in Table 6 are striking: about ¾ of
the credit booms occur in countries with managed or fixed exchange rate regimes, and
this holds for industrial countries, emerging economies, and all countries combined.
Finally, we use frequency analysis to determine the probability that a country will
experience a credit boom once it has crossed the starting threshold. This probability can
be a useful “early warning” indicator for surveillance of credit market conditions. We
considered starting thresholds of ½ and 1 standard deviations of the cyclical component
of our credit measure, and computed the probabilities for industrial countries, emerging

20

economies and all countries combined. Once a starting threshold of 1 (½) standard
deviations is crossed, the probability of a credit boom is 16 (9) percent for emerging
economies, 22 (14) percent for industrial countries, and 18 (11) percent for all countries
combined. Naturally, these probabilities are lower with the lower starting threshold, as it
is less likely that the cyclical expansion of credit turns into a credit boom. The
probabilities are higher for industrial than for emerging economies, indicating that having
crossed the starting threshold is a more precise predictor of credit booms in the former
than in the latter.
4.

Credit Booms and Firm Level Data

Section 3 showed that credit booms are accompanied by a synchronized pattern of
economic expansion followed by contraction. This finding raises an important question:
Are the credit booms and the macro business cycles that accompany them reflected in the
financial conditions of firms and banks at the microeconomic level? To answer this
question, we use the credit boom events identified in Section 2 to construct seven-year
event windows of the evolution of firm- and bank-level financial indicators centered on
the years in which credit booms peaked.
The firm-level data correspond to nonfinancial, publicly-traded firms as reported in
Worldscope and Datastream. The sample period is 1980 to 2005 for the industrial
countries and 1991 to 2005 for the emerging markets. This restricts our analysis to credit
booms dated after 1991 in the emerging markets. Moreover these data have the
drawbacks that the coverage is limited to corporations listed in stock exchanges, and that

21

they are reported on a fiscal year basis, rather than calendar year. Note, however, that
there is no other firm-level, cross-country database with wider coverage available.13
The bank-level data was obtained from Bankscope and it covers the 1995-2005
period.14 These data include balance sheet information for commercial banks, saving
banks, cooperative banks, mortgage banks, medium- and long-term credit banks, and
bank holding companies. The coverage varies from country to country, and since the
sample starts in 1995 our analysis of banking behavior around credit booms is limited to
the last decade. In the analysis below, we do not report bank indicators for the industrial
countries because these countries have experienced only three credit booms since 1995.
It is worth noting, however, that the behavior of these indicators is broadly in line with
that observed in the emerging market economies.
We construct financial indicators for each firm and bank in each country, and focus
on the median firm or bank as country aggregate. Aggregates for emerging and industrial
countries are then generated as medians of the country aggregates. For the firm-level
data, we also construct the breakdown across tradables and nontradables sectors, and
measure sectoral aggregates using the median firm of the corresponding sector.15
4.1

Firm-level indicators
We construct seven firm-level financial indicators: (1) two measures of Tobin’s Q

(the ratio of market to book value of equity, Q1, and the ratio of market value plus total
13

The data are corrected for the presence of multiple listings (firms with multiple country listings are
assigned only to the country of primary listing), dead stocks (companies that go out of business are taken
out from the sample), and outliers (which can be due to either inadequate accounting, as in the case of firms
listed with negative market capitalizations, or statistical outliers, observations that are in excess of two
standard deviations from the mean observation).
14
The data are corrected for the presence of the central bank and government and multilateral institutions
as well as for outliers (either because of inadequate accounting or extreme values).
15
The nontradables sector includes the following industries: construction, printing and publishing,
recreation, retailers, transportation, utilities, and miscellaneous. The tradables sector includes aerospace,
apparel, automotive, beverages, chemical, electrical, electronics, metals, and all others in the database.

22

debt to book value, Q2); (2) effective interest rate (the ratio of total debt service to total
debt obligations, ER); (3) profitability (the return on assets in percent, PR) ; (4) total
leverage (total debt as a percent of book value of assets, LBV, or market value of assets,
LMV); (5) short-term leverage (short-term debt as a percent of market value of assets,
SLMV); (6) working capital leverage (current liabilities in percent of sales, LWK); and (7)
the Rajan-Zingales index of dependence on external financing for investment (RZ), which
is equal to 1 minus the ratio of cash flow from operations to capital expenditures (with
the former adjusted for changes in inventories, payables, and receivables).
Figures 12-17 show the event windows for the financial indicators of firms in
industrial and emerging economies. Figure 12 shows that all leverage ratios rise in the
build up phase of the credit booms and collapse in the declining phase. As in the case of
the macro variables, the amplitude of the fluctuations is much larger for emerging
economies than for industrial countries. Note, however, that the increases in LMV are
particularly large because LMV includes the effect of equity price declines that coincide
with credit boom peaks. Still, the boom-bust cycles in leverage synchronized with credit
booms are also evident in LBV and LWK, which do not use the market value of equity. In
emerging economies, LBV rises about 20 percentage points from its minimum in the
upswing of the boom to the peak (compared with 12 percentage points in industrial
countries) and LWK rises almost 12 percentage points (compared with 2 percentage
points in industrial countries).
The Tobin Q and profitability measures shown in Figure 13 indicate that corporations
in both industrial and emerging economies start the expanding phase of credit booms
from high ratios of asset valuation and profitability, which decline as the credit boom

23

peaks and then remain depressed in the aftermath. Again the magnitude of these
fluctuations is much larger in emerging economies. In contrast, the dynamics of the
effective interest rate are very different in the two groups of countries. In emerging
markets, ER is low in the expansionary phase of the credit booms, and then jumps about
500 basis points one year after the booms peak. In industrial countries, ER is significantly
more stable, and in fact drops slightly after the credit booms peak.
Figure 14 shows the evolution of the RZ index. Corporations are significantly more
dependent on external financing in the build up phase of credit booms than in the
downswing. The size of the correction in the downswing is much larger in emerging
economies than in industrial countries. This evidence is consistent with the argument of
Calvo et al. (2003) suggesting that “creditless recoveries” after Sudden Stops are possible
in emerging economies because firms adjust to the loss of credit so as to provide internal
financing for operational expenses that were previously financed with outside credit.
Figure 15 illustrates important similarities and differences in the evolution of
corporate financial indicators across regions of emerging economies. Firms in Asia are
significantly more leveraged than their Latin American counterparts, and their leverage
ratios fluctuate more sharply during credit booms. Moreover, Tobin’s Q in Asia falls
sharply in a continuous decline during the entire seven-year window, while in Latin
America it shows an ambiguous pattern and a more modest overall decline. Dependence
on external financing falls sharply in both regions in the downswing of credit booms, but
the correction is larger in Latin America than in Asia.
Figure 16 shows the evolution of the financial indicators of emerging economies for
which the tradables and nontradables sectors behave differently (LBV, LMV , LWK and

24

RZ).16 We also include the real exchange rate as a proxy for the relative price of
nontradable goods relative to tradables. The cycles in leverage (LBV, LMV and LWK)
synchronized with the credit booms are again observable in the sectoral aggregates, but
now we can also observe that they are significantly larger for firms in the nontradables
sector and that they are synchronized with the sharp boom-bust cycle of the real exchange
rate. Moreover, the RZ index shows that firms in the tradables sector are slightly more
dependent on outside financing in the expansionary phase of credit booms, and that
dependence on outside financing falls sharply for firms in both sectors, but significantly
more for firms in the nontradables sector. These results are consistent with the Sudden
Stops literature that emphasizes the ability of firms in the tradables sector to have more
stable access to credit than firms in the nontradables sector (e.g. Caballero and
Krishnamurty (1998), Tornell and Westernmann (2005)).
4.2

Bank-level indicators
We constructed four financial indicators using bank data: (1) profitability, measured

by the ratio of net income to average assets (ROA), where average assets are calculated as
the mean of end-of period assets in year t and t-1; (2) non-performing loans, NPL, as a
measure of asset quality; (3) a measure of lending activity as proxied by the ratio of bank
loans to total assets, LAR; and (4) a “capital adequacy” measure, CAR, that measures a
bank’s capital as a ratio of its risk-weighted assets.17 The minimum CAR recommended
by the Basel Committee in Banking Supervision is 8 percent, however, bank supervisors

16

The rest of the financial ratios display very similar dynamics across sectors as in the total aggregates
shown already in Figures 12-14.
17
This measure combines “Tier I capital,” which includes stock issues and disclosed reserves, and “Tier II
capital,” which includes subordinated debt, perpetual securities, expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted
assets and off-balance-sheet risks (see Dewatripont and Tirole (1993)).

25

in the more vulnerable economies, such as EMs, are encouraged to set higher minimum
CARs (often in the 8-12 percent range).
Figure 17 shows the event study window for the financial indicators of banks in
emerging economies. Lending activity is high in the expanding phase of the credit boom,
but at the same time the quality of the banks’ assets deteriorates sharply as nonperforming loans rise from 2.5 percent a year before the peak to 10 percent two years
after the peak of the boom. This evidence is consistent with Dell’ Ariccia and Marquez’s
(2006) argument that the banks’ lowering of lending standards in a boom increases
lending to more risky clients, and hence leads to a subsequent weakening of the quality of
bank’s assets.
The profitability measure indicates that banks yield high profits in the expanding
phase of credit booms. ROA reaches its highest level at 1.5 percent a year before the peak
of the boom, followed by a collapse in the ending phase of the boom. Finally, bank
capital adequacy shows v-shaped dynamics—it drops sharply late in the expanding phase
of credit booms and then rebounds early in the ending phase of the boom, ending at
higher levels than when the booms start. Interestingly, CAR at its trough was just below
12 percent which points to vulnerabilities in the banking system of these economies.
5. Conclusions

This paper proposed a new thresholds method for measuring credit booms, used this
method to identify credit booms in industrial and emerging economies, and conducted an
event study analysis of the dynamics of macro aggregates and micro-level financial
indicators during credit booms. We identified 27 credit booms in industrial countries and
22 in emerging economies during the 1960-2006 period. The build up phase of these

26

booms is associated with economic expansions, rising equity and housing prices, real
currency appreciation, and widening external deficits, followed by the opposite dynamics
in the downswing. Similar dynamics are observed in firm-level indicators of leverage,
firm values, and dependence on external financing, and in bank-level indicators of asset
quality, profitability and lending activity. Moreover, credit booms tend to be
synchronized internationally and centered on “big events” like the 1980s debt crisis, the
1992 ERM crisis, and Sudden Stops in emerging economies.
Despite the similarities in the features of credit booms across industrial and emerging
economies, there are also three major differences: (1) Fluctuations in macroeconomic
aggregates and micro-level indicators during credit booms are larger, more persistent, and
asymmetric in the emerging economies, and this pattern is particularly strong in the
nontradables sector; (2) not all credit booms end in crisis, but many of the recent
emerging markets crises were associated with credit booms; (3) credit booms in emerging
economies tend to be preceded by large capital inflows and not by domestic financial
reforms or TFP gains, while credit booms in industrial countries tend to be preceded by
high TFP or financial reforms. In contrast, the frequency of credit booms in both
emerging and industrial economies is much higher in economies with fixed or managed
exchange rates. These results differ significantly from previous findings in the literature
on credit booms suggesting an ambiguous relationship between credit booms and
economic expansions, and little or no association between financial crises and credit
booms (see Gourinchas et al. (2001)).
The results of our study have important implications for the analysis of macro-finance
linkages, and for surveillance of financial systems and their macroeconomic effects.

27

From the policy perspective, the thresholds method we proposed provides a tractable
framework for measuring and identifying credit booms that are closely associated with
cyclical fluctuations in macro aggregates and key financial indicators of corporations and
banks. Our results show that credit booms can be identified by the size of a credit
expansion relative to trend, and that this information can be supplemented with other
indicators of excessive credit growth: such as booms in output and expenditures,
excessive real appreciation and/or expansion of the nontradables sector, large inflows of
foreign capital (in EMs) and fast TFP growth or domestic financial reforms (in ICs), as
well as increases in the leverage and profitability ratios of corporations and weakening in
the quality of banks’ assets. Moreover, our results also highlight the importance of using
corrective policy actions to prevent credit booms, because the declining phase of credit
booms is associated with recessions and a higher incidence of financial crises.
From the perspective of research on macro-finance linkages, our results provide a set
of robust empirical regularities that can guide research on models of “credit transmission”
by providing the set of facts that these models should aim to explain. These empirical
regularities can be subsumed into two sets of stylized facts: First, the strong association
of credit booms with booms in output and expenditures, rising asset prices, widening
external deficits and sharp real appreciations. Second, the close relationship between
these macro features of credit booms and a similar cyclical pattern in the financial
indicators of corporations and banks.

Measured by:
(1) The ratio of the market value of a firm's equity to the current replacement
cost of assets.
(2) The ratio of the market value of a firm's equity and debt to the current replacement
cost of assets.
Measured by:
(1) The ratio of total debt to book value of equity of the firm.
(2) The ratio of total debt to market value of equity of the firm.
(3) The ratio of short term debt to market value of equity of the firm.
(4) The ratio of current liabilities to sales of the firm.
The ratio of net income to total assets.
The ratio of a firm's capital expenditures minus cash flow from operations to
capital expenditures. This ratio measures a firm's dependence on extenal finance.
The ratio of non-performing loans to gross loans. This is a measure of asset quality.
The ratio of bank loans to total assets. Proxies the percentage of assets assigned to
loans.
Ratio of net income to average assets. This ratio measures the efficiency and
operational performance of a bank.
Total capital adequacy ratio under the Basle rules. This ratio measures a bank's
capital as a ratio of its risk weighted assets.

A situation in which at least one of the following conditions holds: (1) the ratio of nonperforming assets to total asses of the banking sector exceeds 10 percent; (2) the cost
of banking system bailouts exceeds 2 percent of GDP; (3) there is a large scale bank
nationalization as result of banking sector problems; and (4) there are bank runs or new
important depositor protection measures.
A situation in which a country experiences a forced change in parity, abandons a
currency peg or receives a bailout from an international organization, and at the same
time an index of exchange rae market pressure (a weighted average of the depreciation
rate, change in short-term interest rate, and percentage change in reserves) rises
1.5 standard deviations above its mean.
A situation in which a country experiences a year-on-year fall in capital flows that
exceeds 2 standard deviations relative to the mean.

The index captures changes in seven financial policy dimensions:
Abiad, Detragiache, and Tressel (2007)
(1) credit controls and reserve requirements; (2) Interest rate controls; (3) Entry
barriers; (4) State ownership in the banking sector; (5) Capital account restrictions;
(6) Prudential regulations and supervision of the banking sector; and (7) Securities
market policy. The index is just the sum of these seven dimensions(each of wich can
take values between 0 and 3) and takes values between 0 (the lowest) and 21
(the highest).

Appendix 3
THE GOURINCHAS-VALDES-LANDERRETCHE THRESHOLDS METHOD

The thresholds method proposed by GVL uses the ratio of nominal credit to the
private sector to nominal GDP ( L / Y )i ,t as the measure of credit.18 They define the longrun trend of credit using an “expanding trend” by applying the HP filter as follows: Given
EHP
a sample of data for dates t=1,…,T, denote ( L / Y )i ,t as the expanding HP trend of the
credit-GDP ratio in country i at date t, for 1≤ t ≤ T. This expanding trend is the trend
j =t

, where k is a
component of the HP filter applied to the sequence of data ⎡⎣ ( L / Y )i , j ⎤⎦
j =− k
positive integer that defines the length of a sample of “initial data.” In particular, GVL
used a sample for 1960-1996 and set k=5, so their expanding trend starts in 1965 with
EHP
( L / Y )i ,1965 as the 1965 value of the HP trend computed using data from 1960 to 1965,

( L / Y )i ,1966
HP

is the 1966 value of the HP trend computed using data from 1960 to 1966,

and so on. Thus, the sample over which the trend is computed expands by one year as
each successive year in the sample is added. GVL compute all these trends setting the HP
smoothing parameter to 1000. 19
GVL identify a country to have experienced a credit boom when one or more
EHP
EHP
contiguous dates satisfy the following condition: ⎡ ( L / Y )i ,t − ( L / Y )i ,t ⎤ ( L / Y )i ,t ≥ φ .
⎣
⎦
That is, the deviation from the expanding trend in the credit-GDP ratio must be at least as
large as a boom threshold φ .20 The peak of the credit boom occurs on the date within the
set included in the credit boom that shows the largest deviation from the expanding HP
trend, and the starting (ending) date is the date earlier (later) than the peak date at which
the credit-GDP ratio is higher (lower) than a “limit threshold.”21 GVL conduct their event
analysis using φ =19.5 percent and a limit threshold of 5 percent.

18

Since credit is a stock variable, GVL proxy Yit as the geometric average of nominal GDP in t and t+1.
GVL justify the expanding trend by arguing that it reflects the credit information available to
policymakers at a given time. As our comparison of the two methods showed, however, the expanding
trend yields a trend process that is close to a smoothed, one-period lagged transformation of the original
credit series, suggesting that the policymaker would tend to misinterpret the most recent credit observations
as part of a trend rather than a boom. Moreover, the credit data themselves are frequently revised, making
the expanding trend difficult to justify on the basis of representing the information available to
policymakers.
20
GVL refer to this threshold as the “relative deviation threshold.” They also measured credit booms using
an “absolute deviation threshold,” which measures credit booms relative to the size of the economy instead
of the relative size of the banking sector. Their macro event analysis is based on the relative threshold.
21
Notice that this limit threshold does not correct for the discrete nature of the data, as we did in our
method by defining the starting and ending thresholds using an absolute-value metric.
