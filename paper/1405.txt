The Impact of OSHA and EPA Regulation on Productivity

ABSTRACT

This paper presents estimates of the impact of OSHA and EPA regulation on
productivity. Production information for 1450 manufacturing industries from 1958
to 1980

is merged with measures of regulation, including both information on

compliance expenditures by industry and enforcement efforts by OSHA and EPA.

Industries

that faced higher regulation during the l970s had significantly

ipwer productivity growth, and a greater productivity slowdown, than industries

that faced lower regulation. Under certain assumptions, the regulation is
estimated to have reduced average industry productivity growth by .57' percent

per year, 39 percent of the average productivity slowdown. These results are
robust to variations in the itdel and the inclusion of other productivity

determinants, including poor output growth and dependence on ener,r. The
results also suggest a one—time cost of adjustment to regulation, so the
long—run impact nay be less than that estimated here.

Both OSHA and EPA are found to target their enforcement effort towards
those industries that are doing poorly in meeting the goals of the regulation.

However, in the only area where benefits from regulation can be examined, worker
injury rates and OSHA safety inspections, no significant benefits are found.

1. INTRODUCTION

The slowdown in

has

productivity growth in

the U.S. econorrr during the l9TOs

been a matter of great concern to policymakers, associated as it is with

inflation,

unemployment, and declining real wage growth. Many

explanations

possible

for the slowdown have been proposed, and much research has been

done to determine the contribution of these factors to the slowdown. The
research presented here examines the impact on productivity growth of government
regulation, specifically environmental and worker health and safety regulation
by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (051-IA) and the

Environmental Protection Mency (EPA). Looking at data for 1450 manufacturing
industries between 1958 and 1980, the study finds a large, negative relationship

between this regulation and productivity growth. Under certain assumptions, a
large part of the decline in productivity growth during the l9lOs may be

attributed to such regulation. However, the study also finds some evidence that
this decline could be a temporary one, representing a one—time cost of adjusting
to the regulation rather than a recurring cost to society.

The major innovation of the study lies in the creation of a data set that
has information on output and inputs for many industries, allowing the
calculation of their productivity growth rates, along with data concerning the

extent of regulation of each industry. The regulatory data are taken from
surveys

of the cost of compliance with regulation and from regulatory agency

records of the enforcement efforts directed toward different industries. The

basic result is that high levels of regulation are associated with low and
falling rates of productivity growth. This result is not fundamentally changed

2

when measures of other factors that have been suggested as causes of the
productivity slowdown are added to the model.

An attempt is made to measure the benefits from regulation, with very

limited success due to problems with the available data. It is clearly shown
that the regulatory agencies focus their efforts upon industries which are
performing poorly in the areas of concern: worker safety and health, and

environmental pollution. However, other results suggest that in the one area
where there is a useable measure of benefits, worker safety, it is difficult to
attribute significant benefits to regulation.

2. PRODUCTIVITY MEASUREMENT AND RDGULATION

2.1. Definition and Measurement

Productivity is the ratio of output produced to inputs used. Because
output and inputs are measured in different units, it is the growth of

productivity over time, rather than its level, that is of greatest concern. The
simplest measure of productivity is the single—factor measure, where only one

input is measured. In this case, productivity growth is given by the difference

between the growth rates of output and that input. The st commonly used
productivity statistics, measuring labor productivity, are of this form. These
statistics are easy to calculate, but ignore changes in other factors of
production, such as capital or naterials, which could affect output growth.
Other productivity statistics, called total factor productivity (TFP)
measures consider the contribution of all factors to output growth.

3

Consider a production function for a firm,

I = TF(Xi,... ,Xn)
where

output, Y, is a function of the productivity level, P,

and

n inputs X1.

a competitive, profit—maximizing firm, an index of total input growth can be
calculated as

calculation of the growth rate of productivity using the cost shares of

inputs and output and input growth rates is called growth accounting.

2.2.

Effect of Regulation
A simple nndel of

the impact of regulation on productivity would assert

that the production function remains unchanged, but the firm is required to use

some additional inputs, R, to comply with the regulation.

If productivity

growth is calculated for the firm without knowing how much of each input was
used to produce output and how itch to produce compliance, inputs and
productivity would be measured as

Therefore, one would expect an ordinary productivity

growth nasure, which

ignores the existence of compliance inputs, to understate true productivity

growth by an amount equal to the sum of the cost share of each input times the
fraction of that input used for compliance.

Regulation nay affect the firm's production beyond simply requiring the use
of some inputs for compliance activities.

Regulation commonly imposes

constraints on the firm's choice of production processes. These constraints
could force firms to change existing

procedures, reducing productivity during

the period of adjustment. Additionally, the presence of regulation and the
possibility of future changes in regulation, increases the

uncertainty faced by

firms, which could reduce investment in new rthods of production and inhibit
productivity growth.

A simple test for the presence of an impact of regulation on productivity

beyond the neasurement impact is available. Suppose that

productivity growth

before regulation is imposed is t0. Also suppose that the fraction of each
input used for compliance sñth regulation is 6j.

If

actual productivity growth

remains unchanged, equation 2 gives the change in neasured productivity after
regulation as

(3)

dT=t1—t0=

Now consider taking observations on compliance costs and
productivity

growth for ny different industries, indexed by j.

Restating Equation 3:

5

drj =

(14)

+

a0

Ii(ajjoij)

+

Here we recognize that actual productivity growth is
likely to change over time
for various reasons, and use a0, the average productivity change for all
industries, and Cj, an industry—specific component, to account for this change.

If we believe that there is no relationship between

regulation, as measured

by compliance costs, and changes in actual productivity growth, we would expect
the regression indicated in Equation 14

to yield y =

—1.

If there is some

impact of regulation on actual productivity, we would expect Ii * —1 and
probably li < —1, since ntst of the impacts of regulation would be expected to
reduce actual productivity.

When measures of compliance costs are not available, but other measures
(say M±j) of different levels of regulation applied to different industries are
available, such as enforcement effort, we can rewrite Equation 14 as

2.3 Growth of Regulation
There was a substantial increase in government regulation of business

during the early l9TOs. Both the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were created in 1970. The

pattern followed by both agencies is similar: before the early l9TOs, the
primary responsibility for regulation lay with the states. The states varied
enormously both in regulatory standards set and in the enforcement effort they

used to ensure compliance. Public dissatisfaction with the poor performance of
the state—level regulation led to pressure for federal action, and federal
agencies were empowered to tighten the standards and especially to increase the

enforcement effort. In the case of 05kM, this meant setting standards on a
national level, and using a large force of federal compliance officers to

enforce compliance.1
For EPA, the states still bore the responsibility for developing and
administering State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to achieve reductions in
pollution, but the law set strict timetables for the SIP development and gave

EPA the power to force the states to prepare a plan. There were some national
inspectors, to help check on the effectiveness of the states' effort, but not as

many as at 05kM. On the water pollution side, the EPA was required to establish
a permit system for all effluent discharges, designed to met certain water

quality standards. Compliance with both types of regulation was to be enforced
through the courts.

Both EPA and 05kM are required by law not to consider compliance costs when

deciding what standards to propose. The standards proposed often specify the

I

control techniques to be used, and tend to require capital—intensive compliance

methods. The standards have also changed over time, in response to new
information on health risks, political pressures from various groups, and court
decisions.

There is some doubt about the power of the agencies to enforce compliance
with the standards, because rare inspections are combined with low fines for

violations to yield very low expected penalties for non—compliance. Table 2.1
presents data on the manufacturing inspections carried out by OSHA and EPA

during the time period of the study. Because OSHA concentrates on manufacturing
to a great extent, the inspection rates are not completely negligible, with

about 10 percent of all manufacturing workplaces inspected each year. Also, the
inspections are not randomly allocated, so some establishments can have quite a
high probability of being inspected in a given year.

Table 2.1 also provides some information on penalties assessed and an

estimate of expenditures on compliance by the firms. The penalties are quite
low relative to the compliance expenditures, suggesting that nost compliance

expenditures are nntivated by other reasons. The historical neasure of
pollution abatement capital, also presented in Table 2.1, showed that pollution
abatement capital has grown nuch nnre rapidly than other capital, especially
from the late l960s through the middle 1910s. We do not have such time series

data for worker health and safety investment. It seems likely that such
investment has increased since OSHA's inception, but was probably not zero
before.

PRODUCTIVITY SLOWDOWN —

3.1.

Evidence for Slowdown

EVIDENCE AND (PLANATIONS

The most widely observed measure of productivity is the labor productivity

index produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This measures productivity as
the real output produced per worker—hour of all workers. It is calculated for
several sectors of the econonv, including the private business, nonfarm

business, and inufacturing sectors. Average growth rates for these sectors
during several periods are given in Table 3.1.

During the early postwar period, all three sectors showed impressive growth

rates: between 1950 and 1969 output per worker hour rose about 2.5 percent per

year. The most rapid growth came during the long expansion of the 1960s. Some
slowdown in the non—manufacturing sector is seen by the period between 1969 and

1913, and nufacturing follows suit in the 1913—1980 period. During the 1910s
all three sectors showed very low rates of labor productivity growth by postwar
standards, dropping to less than half their 1950—1969 levels.

These studies indicate that total factor productivity
growth fell

substantially during the l9TOs, relative to the rest of the postwar
period. The
studies cited here suggest that the decline in productivity
growth began in the
early l97Os (around 1913),
although others have found the decline
beginning in
the late 1960s. There
seems little doubt from these data that there was a
slowdown in productivity
growth, however measured, during the l9TOs (although
Darby (1982) argues that the slowdown

is an illusion, caused by the imposition

and later lifting of price controls in the early l970s).

decline in capital investment by business, a fall in research and development
activities, and a decline in the quality of inputs (especially

labor).

Denison (1979) uses econonw_wide data and calculations based on the
growth accounting framework to measure the contribution of different factors to

the slowdown. His is the most complete attempt to measure the contributions of
various factors. He discusses all of them, provides estimates for some
(including government regulation) and concludes that many were involved in the

slowdown. He ascribes some of the slowdown in total

factor productivity growth

of 2.17 percent to resource allocation (.30), the legal and human environment
(.30), economies of scale (.13) and other minor factors.

However, he is left

with an unexplained fall in residual productivity growth of 1.68 percent after
accounting for those factors he could measure.

Studies which calculate the contribution of regulation to the slowdown

on compliance cost estimates tend to produce small estimates. Denison
(1979) estimates that such regulation contributed .35 percent to the

based

productivity slowdown in the 1972—1975 period, and in a later study (1983)
concludes that the contribution fell to .15 percent in the 1973—1981

period.

Portney (1981) notes that little of GNP is spent on pollution control (under 2
percent).

Estimates using cross—indust or time—series data have generally given
slightly larger, but similar results. Norsworthy, Harper and Kunze (1979) find
that pollution abatement capital had a limited effect on labor productivity.
Scherer (1982) finds that pollution and health and safety investment reduced
productivity growth by .19 to .27 percent, but this effect is not significant.

relationship disappears when a

Using time—series data, Siegel (1979)

observes a significant contribution (.5 percent) from pollution control
expenditures to the productivity slowdown for 1965—1973, but not for later

years. Finally, Gollop and Roberts (1983) examine data for a set of electric
utilities and find that regulation of emissions

had a large impact on total

factor productivity, lowering it for regulated firms by .59 percent. The
conclusion of these studies (except

perhaps for Gollop and Roberts) is that

pollution abatement costs in particular, and

regulation in general, explain

about 10 percent of the productivity slowdown.

We can reach four general conclusions from

previous work. First, there was

a productivity slowdown during the l970s, at least in measured productivity.
Second, many

different

factors seem to have contributed to it, to different

degrees. Third, government regulation contributed a small but significant

amount to the slowdown. Fourth, a sizeable fraction of the slowdown remains
unexplained by the estimated contributions of all the factors considered. We
now proceed to the empirical analysis in Section 5, after discussing the data
sources used.

Regulation Measures — Compliance Costs

There is very limited data on costs to firms of complying with
OSHA

regulation. The data we consider here

are taken from an annual McGraw—Hill

survey on capital spending for the 1913 to 1980

period. Each year McGraw—I-{in

collects information from a few hundred large firms on current.year capital
expenditures and projected expenditures for the next year, and for two
years

later. One question asks what fraction of total capital
spending is allocated
to worker safety and health. Problems with this data include the
nonrepresentative nature of the firms sampled, the low response rate
(especially on the safety and health

question), and the small size of the total

sample. These data are examined briefly in

Section 5,

but

they prove

unsatisfactory.

The data for EPA—related

compliance costs were also taken from a survey,

but this survey was far superior to that used for OSHA—related costs.

These

data are from the Pollution Abatement
Costs and Expenditures Survey, taken
annually by the Bureau of the Census since

1913. The survey is sent to about

20,000 establishments a subsample of those in the Annual Survey of

For each of the TFPCHG equations the
constant term nEasures the
estimated change in productivity growth if regulation had been
zero. The nean of the dependent variable is the actual change in
productivity growth. The difference between these two numbers is
the estimated contribution of
regulation to productivity growth
(negative in all cases). This is expressed above as a fraction of
the actual productivity dec1ine.

ii.

Appendix Table A—i presents a list of the top 10 industries for each

of the major regulation variables, and some measures of the distribution of
each variable.

12. The fractions used here are the fractions of all compliance
expenditures accounted for by manufacturing, based on data from the
U.S. Council on Environmental Quality report (1980) which presents
estimates of total compliance costs, and the manufacturing cost data.

13. From U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (1980) which indicates that
manufacturing was responsible for about b4 percent of all workplace
injuries and 25 percent of fatalities.
lb. One could argue that these abatement expenditures are a
beneficial result of the EPA inspections, not a determinant of them.

However, differences in changes in these expenditures over time are
negatively (not positively) related to differences in the EPA
inspection rates.
