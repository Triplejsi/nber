Much Ado About Nothing: American Jobs and the Rise of Service Outsourcing to China and
India
Runjuan Liu and Daniel Trefler
NBER Working Paper No. 14061
June 2008
JEL No. F16
ABSTRACT
We examine the impact on U.S. labor markets of offshore outsourcing in services to China and India.
We also consider the reverse flow or 'inshoring' which is the sale of services produced in the United
States to unaffiliated buyers in China and India. Using March-to-March matched CPS data for 1996-2006
we examine the impacts on (1) occupation and industry switching, (2) weeks spent unemployed as
a share of weeks in the labor force, and (3) earnings. We precisely estimate small positive effects
of inshoring and smaller negative effects of offshore outsourcing. The net effect is positive.
To illustrate how small the effects are, suppose that over the next nine years all of inshoring and offshore
outsourcing grew at rates experienced during 1996-2005 in business, professional and technical services
i.e., in segments where China and India have been particularly strong. Then workers in occupations
that are exposed to inshoring and offshore outsourcing (1) would switch 4-digit occupations 2 percent
less often, (2) would spend 0.1 percent less time unemployed, and (3) would earn 1.5 percent more.
These are not annual changes – they are changes over nine years – and are thus best described as small
positive effects.

Beginning in the mid-1990s, cumulative improvements in information and communications
technologies (ICT) facilitated a dramatic expansion of international trade in services. The
interaction of these improvements with a politically driven increase in the outward orientation of
China and India has had two major consequences for the pattern of world trade. First, educated
U.S. workers are competing for the first time ever with educated but low-paid foreign workers.
Second, the most entrepreneurial of these educated workers are providing key inputs into the
final product so that, as in Antrás (2003) and Antrás and Helpman (2004), these inputs are
provided in outsourcing relationships rather than within multinationals.

In short, educated

American workers are now facing intense competition from the offshore outsourcing of services
to China and India.
This development has captured just about everyone’s attention.

Samuelson (2004) and

Blinder (2005) have emphasized its potential dangers while Bhagwati, Panagariya and Srinivasan
(2004) and Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008) have pointed to its potential benefits. The U.S.
Senate has taken a dim view of those who speak out against the mounting jobs hysteria (e.g.,
Mankiw and Swagel, 2006) while international organizations have taken a more balanced view
of the costs and benefits (e.g., UNCTAD, 2004; OECD, 2006). Even management consultants
have been in on the act, seeing the potential to attract business through either over-blown claims
(e.g., Forrester Research, 2002) or considered opinion (e.g., Baily and Farrell, 2004). Yet to date
there has not been a multivariate econometric assessment of the impact of offshore outsourcing
on educated, white-collar U.S. workers. We know nothing about what offshore outsourcing of
services to China and India has meant for the incidence of industry and occupation switching, for
weeks spent unemployed, or for education- and experience-adjusted earnings.
There is, of course, a large related literature on offshore outsourcing spawned by the seminal

work of Feenstra and Hanson (1996, 1999). Much of this literature is concerned with inequality
and the relative demand for skills. See Verhoogen (2008) for a recent contribution. See also
Amiti and Wei (2005a, 2005b, 2006a) for related work on employment and productivity. The
closest paper to ours is Amiti and Wei (2006b). They regress changes in industry-level U.S.
manufacturing employment over the 1992-2000 period on Feenstra-Hanson measures of
outsourcing and find modest employment impacts. We depart from the few existing econometric
studies in several ways.
First, we focus only on services, only on offshore outsourcing and only on low-wage trading
partners. Most of the literature deals with manufacturing and works with the sum of offshore
outsourcing and foreign direct investment. The literature also usually looks at all trade rather
than just trade with low-wage countries, though see Bernard, Jensen and Schott (2006) and Liu
(2007) for exceptions. Offshore outsourcing of services to low-wage countries is where the
debate has been most intense and where the econometric analysis has been all but absent. The
international trade data we use are international service transactions between unaffiliated parties
for the period 1995-2005. The data are produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).
Second, we examine the flip side of offshore outsourcing, namely, the sale of services
produced in the United States to unaffiliated parties in low-wage countries. For brevity we refer
to this as ‘inshoring.’1 It is inappropriate to look only at the costs of offshore outsourcing to lowwage countries without at the same time looking at the benefits of inshoring to these countries.
Third, we work with March-to-March matched Current Population Survey (CPS) data for
1996-2006.

This allows us to control for worker characteristics and exploit longitudinal

evidence. Our strategy of combining matched CPS data with trade data has been influenced by

1

Slaughter (2004) coined the term “insourcing” to refer to foreign direct investment rather than outsourcing. We are
unabashedly stealing his term.

2

Goldberg and Tracy’s (2003) excellent work on the effect of exchange rates on wages and job
switching. It is the only study we know of that uses matched CPS data to study an international
trade issue. We examine four worker outcomes: (1) industry switching, (2) occupation switching,
(3) annual changes in weeks spent unemployed as a share of total weeks in the labor force (as in
Murphy and Topel, 1987), and (4) changes in earnings.
Turning to our results, we precisely estimate either small negative effects or zero effects of
offshore outsourcing on all four outcomes. We also precisely estimate small positive effects or
zero effects of inshoring on each of these outcomes. The positive inshoring effects are either as
large as or larger than the negative offshore outsourcing effects so that the net effect is either
slightly positive or zero. Since the small effects are precisely estimated we can say with
confidence that even if service trade with China and India grows at its current clip, the labormarket implications will be small. In short, we find that the labor-market consequences of
inshoring and offshore outsourcing of services to China and India are, to quote the Bard, much
ado about nothing.
The remainder of this introduction reviews additional aspects of the related literature. The
observation that there has been almost no econometric research on the effect of inshoring and
offshore outsourcing on our four outcomes should not be misconstrued to mean that there has
been no research at all. Much of the existing research is primarily concerned with counting the
number of U.S. workers who are in industries or occupations that are exposed to inshoring and
offshore outsourcing in services. This is done by concording the classification systems used to
record international trade in services with various industry and occupation classification systems
used to record employment data. See Bardhan and Kroll (2003), Garner (2004), Kirkegaard
(2004), Blinder (2005), van Welsum and Vickery (2005), and van Welsum and Reif (2006a,

3

2006b, 2006c, 2006d). We use the by-now standard concordance that comes out of these studies
to link international trade data with CPS data.
Jensen and Kletzer (2005) provide a very different and novel way of thinking about exposure
to international service trade. If U.S. production of a service is concentrated geographically
within the United States then it must be that the service is traded across regions within the United
States. Jensen and Kletzer argue that it must therefore be tradable internationally. Using this
insight, they find that about 28 percent of employment is in tradable occupations. This estimate
is very similar to our own estimate of 24 percent.
This paper is related to two strands of research. Research on worker mobility has found that
human capital is partly specific to industries and occupations e.g., Jacobson, LaLonde and
Sullivan (1993), Neal (1995), and Kambourov and Manovskii (forthcoming). This implies that
human capital will be destroyed by industry and occupation switching that is induced by offshore
outsourcing. Thus, estimates of the impact of service offshore outsourcing on industry and
occupation switching is important for the design of policy. There is also an emerging literature
on the effect of trade openness on individual income volatility. See McLaren and Newman
(2002), Krabs, Krishna and Maloney (2005) and Bergin, Feenstra and Hanson (2007). We do
not examine income volatility though our work has implications for it.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 1 reviews the trends in outsourced international
service trade. Section 2 describes our March-to-March CPS matching and the concordance
between the BEA international service trade classification and the CPS industry and occupation
classifications. Section 3 describes the key variables. Section 4 provides a simple difference-indifference analysis of the impacts of inshoring and offshore outsourcing. Sections 5-7 present
the main econometric results. Section 8 provides a lengthy sensitivity analysis that is entirely

4

responsible for the unusual length of the paper. The less interested reader who skips section 8
will find this paper to be of average length. Section 9 concludes.

1. U.S. International Trade in Services: Inshoring and Offshore Outsourcing
We are interested in the labor-market impacts of the offshore outsourcing of services. The usual
data used in studies of service-trade impacts do not distinguish between (1) offshore outsourcing
– which is an arm’s length transaction between unaffiliated parties and (2) offshoring –which is
the sum of affiliated-party and unaffiliated-party trade. 2 See the state-of-the-art studies by Amiti
and Wei (2006b) and van Welsum and Reif (2006d). See also Trefler (2005, forthcoming) and
Helpman and Trefler (2006). Service trade data originate from balance-of-payments surveys.
To isolate offshore outsourcing in services we use BEA data on international service transactions
between unaffiliated parties. See Borga and Mann (2004) for details of the BEA database. As is
standard in the offshoring literature, we only consider the BEA category ‘other private services.’
It is defined as total private-sector services less transportation services, royalties and license fees.
We will henceforth reserve the term offshore outsourcing for international transactions involving
the sale of a foreign-produced service to an unaffiliated U.S. party. Likewise, we will reserve the
term inshoring for international transactions involving the sale of a U.S.-produced service to an
unaffiliated foreign party.3
We use trade data for the period 1996-2005 or, when using lags, for 1995-2004. 1995 and

2

Two parties are unaffiliated if neither has a controlling interest in the other.
It would have been interesting to complement our analysis with a parallel analysis of affiliated-party service trade
or even total service trade. Unfortunately, the BEA does not report this information by detailed country and type of
service. On the other hand, there have been a number of studies of affiliated-party trade. Harrison and McMillan
(2006) provide a thorough examination of the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs by U.S. multinationals. They find
that job creation in affiliates located in low-income (high-income) countries substitutes for (complements) job
creation in U.S.-based plants. Using service-sector data, Feinberg and Keane (2006) find that fast-growing U.S.
multinationals tend to expand employment everywhere whereas slow-growing U.S. multinationals tend to contract
employment everywhere.

1996 are convenient starting dates because inshoring and offshore outsourcing with China and
India were at low levels until then. (Recall that offshore outsourcing of services to India came to
prominence during the Y2K scare of the late 1990s.)

Given the familiar difficulties of

disentangling Mainland Chinese and Hong Kong trade (Feenstra, Lipsey, Deng, Ma, and Mo,
2005), we include Hong Kong in our Chinese trade data.4

See appendix 1 for additional data

details.
Table 1 provides some basic statistics on inshoring and offshore outsourcing. The largest
category of U.S. inshoring is business, professional, and technical (BPT) services. This includes
ICT services (e.g., call centers and software development) as well as various legal, engineering,
management consulting, R&D and advertising services. Column 1 reports the dollar value of
these U.S. exports (inshoring) in 2005. Columns 2-4 report the average annual log change in
inshoring over the 1996-2005 period for the world, China plus India, and the G8.5 Columns 7-9
report the corresponding growth rates of offshore outsourcing. China and India’s inshoring and
offshore outsourcing have been growing at 0.11 and 0.02 log points per year, respectively. See
the last row of columns 3 and 8. The slow 0.02 growth of offshore outsourcing will come as a
surprise. It is due to declines in telecommunications, China and India’s largest offshore
outsourcing segment. These declines may be reversed if China’s version of third-generation
wireless telecommunication standards (TD-SCDMA) is adopted in the future. When attention is
focused exclusively on computer and information services, the growth rate of offshore
outsourcing rises to a remarkable 0.39 log points a year.
There are two notable numbers in the table that will be used repeatedly below. For Chinese

In the robustness section we include all low-wage countries for which bilateral data are available and find that this
does not alter our results. This is to be expected given China and India’s dominance.

The G8 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom. We exclude the United States
(the exporter) and Russia (hardly a rich economy) from the G8.

and Indian activities with the highest profile (BPT Services), the growth rates are 0.14 for
inshoring and 0.16 for offshore outsourcing. These growth rates will be used for the ‘rapidgrowth effect’ described below.
Since cross-industry variation in growth rates for China and India documented in columns 3
and 8 are one of the sources of sample variation exploited in our regression analysis, it is useful
to be reminded of their causes. First, ICT-related technological change has been more relevant
for some industries (such as computer and information services) than others (such as advertising).
Second, for political economy reasons entirely exogenous to the U.S. labor market, China and
India began liberalizing their economies in the early 1990s.6 These exogenous liberalizations
provided U.S. firms with access to skilled but low-paid workers from China and India and this
access had greater cost implications for some industries (such as call centers) than for others
(such as R&D). The liberalization also exogenously provided U.S. firms with access to a
growing market that was in desperate need of some but not all U.S. services e.g., banking and
insurance. It is helpful to separate out these two sources of cross-industry variation because
much of the discussion about offshore outsourcing has been focused not on its general, ICTenabled rise with all countries, but on its specific rise with China and India.
Table 1 allows one to partially disentangle the first source of variation (the pure ICT effect)
from the second source (the interaction of ICT with exogenous liberalizations). Columns 4 and 9
of the table document the growth rates of inshoring and offshore outsourcing for the G8. This
G8 growth was driven by ICT developments and had nothing to do with Chinese and Indian
liberalizations. Indeed, the China-India growth rates in column 3 are not that correlated with the
G8 growth rates in column 4. The correlation is only 0.43. Column 5 looks at the difference

In China, market reforms accelerated in 1992 as a result of Deng Xiaoping’s famous Southern Tour. In India,
market reforms started in July 1991 as a result of a severe balance of payments crisis.

between columns 3 and 4. It shows that there have been large differences between the G8 and
China-India in inshoring growth rates. This suggests that a substantial portion of the crossindustry variation in growth rates for China and India had less to do with a pure ICT effect and
more to do with how ICT interacted with Chinese and Indian economic liberalizations. As a
result, in our regression analysis we will use G8 trade data in various ways as a control and/or
instrument for the pure effects of ICT-related technological change.

2. CPS Data and its Link to Trade Data
We match individuals across consecutive March CPS surveys from 1996 to 2006 in order to
extract longitudinal information about work histories. 7 We start the matching procedure by
extracting the subsample of all civilian adults who were surveyed in March of some year t. We
then apply Madrian and Lefgren’s (2000) two-stage matching algorithm to find a match in the
March survey of year t +1. In the first or ‘naïve’ stage, individuals are matched based on three
variables: a household identifier, a household number, and an individual line number within a
household. If all three variables are the same in two consecutive March surveys then a naïve
match is made. In the second stage, a naïve match is discarded if it fails the S|R|A merge
criterion i.e., if in the two consecutive March surveys the individual’s sex changes, the
individual’s race changes, or the individual’s age changes inappropriately.8 The naïve and final
match rates for each year appear in appendix table A.1. Averaging across all years, the naïve
match rate is 67 percent, the S|R|A discard rate is 5 percent, and the final match rate is 64 percent
(0.67 × 0.95 = 0.64). Note that for 2001-2006 we also discard oversamples in the State Children
7

For international trade economists who are not familiar with the CPS, the most important thing to understand here
about the structure of the CPS is that, very roughly speaking, an individual is surveyed in March of two consecutive
years and then dropped from the CPS. We track (or match) individuals across the two consecutive years.
8
Following Madrian and Lefgren (2000), an inappropriate age change is less than –1 or more than 3. See Madrian
and Lefgren (2000) for more detailed information about the matching algorithm.

8

Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) extended sample files. Our final match rate is similar to the
rates of 62 percent in Goldberg and Tracy (2003) and 67 percent in Madrian and Lefgren (2000).
Since the actual match rate is lower than the match rate of 100 percent that would obtain in
the absence of mortality, migration, non-response and recording errors, there is obviously a
selection issue associated with using matched CPS data. Neumark and Kawaguchi (2004) partly
dispel this selection concern by comparing the estimation results based on matched CPS data to
results based on the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) which follows
individuals who move. However, as a precaution, in section 8.3 we model selection as a probit
and simultaneously estimate the selection equation together with our labor-market outcome
regressions. While we cannot reject selection bias, the coefficients we care about are virtually
the same as in OLS specifications.
Each worker in the CPS sample is linked to a trade flow via the worker’s occupation and
industry of affiliation. We thus need two concordances. One maps the trade categories in table 1
into the Census industry classification. The other maps the table 1 trade categories into the
Census occupation classification.

For example, consider a programmer who works for an

insurance company. Demand for her services will depend on demand in the insurance industry
(the industry link) and on the demand for computer programmers (the occupation link).
The linking of service-trade data to industries and occupations is now commonplace in the
offshore outsourcing literature e.g., Bardhan and Kroll (2003), Garner (2004), Blinder (2005),
Jensen and Kletzer (2005), Kirkegaard (2005), Mann (2005), van Welsum and Vickery (2005)
and van Welsum and Reif (2006b). For the sake of non-trade economists we emphasize that we
are not breaking new ground here. Appendix tables A.2 and A.3 present our mapping from the
table 1 trade categories into industries and occupations, respectively. The mappings are very

9

similar to those reported elsewhere e.g., van Welsum and Vickery (2005) and van Welsum and
Reif (2006b).9
Our CPS sample of matched workers consists of 158,291 private workers aged 18-64. 37,550
of these workers or 24 percent are in occupations that map into service-trade categories.
Following the extensive literature cited above, we say that these workers are in occupations that
are exposed to inshoring and offshore outsourcing and refer to them as the occupation-exposed
sample. 24,261 of our 158,291 workers, or 15 percent, are in industries that map into the table 1
service-trade categories i.e., that are exposed to inshoring and offshore outsourcing. We refer to
these 24,261 workers as the industry-exposed sample. These two samples will be important for
what follows. Note that there is overlap between them: 15,183 workers are in both samples.

3. Variable Definitions
Summary statistics for the occupation-exposed sample are presented in table 2. The
corresponding statistics for the industry-exposed sample appear in appendix table A.4. We will
go through the statistics in detail in order to ensure that the definition of key variables is properly
understood. Since each worker appears in two consecutive March surveys we will use t to
denote the year of the first March survey. t is what appears in the ‘Year’ column of table 2.
Industry and Occupation Switching: In both March surveys the worker is asked about her
occupation in the longest job held last year (t – 1 or t). A worker is a 4-digit occupation switcher
if she worked in both years and had different occupations in years t – 1 and t. This raw
switching rate is notoriously noisy. We thus filter it as suggested by Moscarini and Thomsson

9

Welsum is the lead OECD researcher on this topic.

10

(2006). To be a valid switch, the worker must also have (1) changed her class10 or (2) looked for
a job last year or (3) switched industries.11 See appendix 2 for details. The generalization to 1and 2- digit switching and to industry switching is immediate.
Consider column 1 of table 2. It reports 4-digit occupation switching rates for the occupationexposed sample. For example, the 1996 row reports that 28 percent of workers switched 4-digit
occupations between 1995 and 1996. From the bottom panel of the table, switching rates
averaged across all years fall to 0.20 at the 2-digit level and 0.17 at the 1-digit level.12
Our occupation switching rates at the 1- and 2-digit levels are similar to those in Kambourov
and Manovskii (2008) who use 1996 PSID data. They report switching rates of 0.18 at the 2digit level and 0.16 at the 1-digit level. We cannot compare our 4-digit rates to anything in their
work because they use older 3-digit 1970 Census codes while we use 4-digit 2002 Census codes.
However, our 4-digit rate of 0.28 is significantly higher than their 3-digit rate of 0.22. Our
higher 4-digit rate may have to do with differences between the 1970 and 2002 Census codes.
The latter introduced new occupations and industries and also coded existing occupations and
industries more finely (especially in services). Thus, there does not appear to be major
unexplained differences between our switching rates and those in the more careful, PSID-based
study by Kambourov and Manovskii. Finally, while switching rates calculated from the CPS are
notoriously too high it is essential to remember that we are not interested in switching levels per
se. We will be using occupation switching rates in a regression framework with occupation and
year fixed effects. Thus, what is potentially problematic for us is the possibility that occupation
miscoding varies systematically with inshoring and offshore outsourcing even after controlling
10

There are three classes of workers: (i) private, which includes working in a private for-profit company or being
self-employed and incorporated; (ii) self-employed but not incorporated; and (iii) government employee.
11
Our results are the same with or without the inclusion of this ‘switch-industry’ filter.
12
The upward blip in 2002 results from the reclassification of Census industry and occupation codes that was
introduced in 2003. All of our results survive the deletion of 2002 from the sample.

11

for occupation and year fixed effects. There is little reason to expect such systematic miscoding.
Thus, CPS occupation miscoding does not appear to be a major issue in our context. The same
holds for industry switching.13
Change in Unemployment: Change in unemployment is defined as the change in the
number of weeks unemployed as a proportion of total labor force weeks. This definition of
unemployment is based on retrospective information from the March CPS and was suggested by
Murphy and Topel (1987). Changes in the proportion of labor force weeks spent unemployed
appear in column 4 of table 2.
Change in Annual Earnings: Annual earnings are defined as CPI-deflated annual income
from wages and salaries. Means for this variable appear in column 7 of table 2.
Worker Characteristic Controls: In the regression analysis we will be including the usual
controls for worker characteristics. Sample means for these controls appear in appendix table
A.5. Experience is defined as age minus years of schooling minus six. We classify educational
attainment into four groups: (1) high-school drop-outs, (2) high-school graduates, (3) college
dropouts and (4) college graduates.14 Over half of both samples are college graduates. We refer
collectively to groups (1)-(3) as non-college graduates. We also classify workers into four skill
groups: (1) unskilled blue collar, (2) skilled blue collar, (3) less-skilled white collar and (4)
skilled white collar. These groups are defined in appendix 3. As shown in appendix table A.5,
over 95 percent of our occupation- and industry-exposed samples are white-collar workers. The
remaining demographic variables in table A.5 are self-explanatory.

13

We are indebted to Gueorgui Kambourov for help with defining occupational switching.
A college graduate has one of the following: a degree from college or occupational/vocational program; an
associate degree from college or academic program; a bachelor's degree; a master’s degree, a professional school
degree, or a doctoral degree.

4. A Simple Difference-of-Difference Analysis
Before presenting our regression-based estimates of the impact of inshoring and offshore
outsourcing, we begin with a simple difference-in-differences analysis.15 We compare the labor
market outcomes of service workers who were exposed to inshoring and offshore outsourcing to
those who were not. Then we examine whether the difference between the two groups grew over
time as inshoring and offshore outsourcing intensified. In particular, we start with the 115,090
matched workers in private service occupations (Census major occupation codes 1-5) and divide
this group into those in our occupation-exposed sample (37,550 workers) and the remainder
(77,540 workers).
Consider the results for occupation switching in column 2 of table 2. Positive numbers
indicate that occupation switching was higher for the exposed sample than for the unexposed
sample. However, the differences are not statistically significant (column 3). Further, there is no
upward trend over time in column 2. That is, exposed workers did not switch more relative to
unexposed workers as inshoring and offshoring intensified.16
Turning to the share of labor force weeks spent unemployed, column 5 of table 2 shows that
the occupation-exposed sample spent more time unemployed than did the unexposed sample.
However, the exposed-unexposed difference is not significant and did not increase over time.
The table therefore provides no support for the claim that exposure to inshoring and offshore
outsourcing raised the share of weeks in the labor force spent unemployed.
In contrast, table 2 does provide evidence that exposure has lead to lower earnings. From
column 8, earnings changes were smaller for the exposed sample than for the unexposed sample
15

We are grateful to Thomas Lemieux for this and many other suggestions.
Appendix table A.4 provides the corresponding results for industry switching in the industry-exposed sample. For
the industry-exposed sample we start with the 78,586 matched workers in private service industries (Census major
industry codes 7-12) and divide this group into those in our industry-exposed sample (24,261 workers) and the
remainder (54,325 workers).

16

13

and this difference has become more pronounced over time. We will see below that this result is
driven by occupation switchers.
Section 8.4 revisits this analysis in a regression setting with full controls and finds that none
of the table 2 double differences (exposed versus unexposed and 1996-2000 versus 2001-2005)
is statistically significant.
The above analysis is more sophisticated than what has appeared in the recent literature on
offshore outsourcing. Nevertheless, by academic standards it is too simplistic. First, it does not
control for differences in worker characteristics between the exposed and unexposed samples.
Appendix table A.5 shows that differences in worker characteristics are important. For example,
exposed workers are more likely to be college graduates, skilled white-collar workers, married,
male, and white. Second, the above analysis does not control for differences in the degree of
exposure: some of the exposed industries have been hard hit while others have been only slightly
affected. Third, it does not and can not distinguish between offshore outsourcing from low-wage
versus high-wage countries. To deal with these issues we turn to a regression framework.

5. An Econometric Analysis of Switching
5.1. The Econometric Specification
We begin with some notation. Individual i first appears in the sample in March of year t(i) and
then appears for the second and last time in March of year t(i) + 1. Let j(i) and o(i) be i’s 4-digit
industry and occupation, respectively, in the longest job held last year i.e., in t(i) – 1. We will
work with both industry and occupation switching. However, consider industry switching first
for the sake of concreteness. Let Industry_Switchi,t(i) be a binary indicator equal to 1 if i’s 4digit industry of affiliation changes between the longest jobs held in t(i) – 1 and t(i). Let

14

M CI
j ( i ),t ( i ) −1 be U.S. offshore outsourcing to China and India in service industry j(i) in calendar
17
year t(i) – 1. Correspondingly, let X CI
Let r(i)
j ( i ),t ( i ) −1 be U.S. inshoring from China and India.

be i’s state of residence in March of year t(i). We estimate a probit of the determinants of
switching:

Pr( Industry _ Switchi ,t (i ) )

(

CI
= Φ θWi ,t ( i ) + β ln(M CI
j ( i ),t ( i ) −1 ) + γ ln( X j ( i ),t ( i ) −1 ) + λ j ( i ) + λ o ( i ) + λt ( i ) + λ r ( i )

)

(1)

where Φ is the normal cumulative distribution function, λ j (i ) and λo (i ) are industry and
occupation fixed effects, λt (i ) is a year fixed effect and λ r (i ) is a state fixed effect. Wi,t(i) is a
vector of worker characteristics. 18 Note that we are not using a panel:

each observation

corresponds to a different individual. In what follows we will drop the i arguments of j(i), o(i),
19 20
CI
t(i) and r(i). Our focus variables are ln( M CI
j ,t −1 ) and ln( X j ,t −1 ) .

An immediate question about the specification is whether inshoring and offshore outsourcing
should be entered in levels as we have done or in annual log changes. With annual log changes
the sample variation is, somewhat surprisingly, greatest in industries that had consistently low
levels of inshoring and offshore outsourcing. This is because small industries tend to have
highly variable annual growth rates. For example, the level of offshore outsourcing to China and

17

Restated, M CI
is unaffiliated-party U.S. imports of service j(i) from China and India and X CI
is
j ( i ),t ( i ) −1
j ( i ),t ( i ) −1

unaffiliated-party U.S. exports of service j(i) to China and India.
These are years of experience, experience squared, years of schooling, as well as dummies for sex, race, marital
status and veteran status.
19
The trade data are for the calendar year t – 1 while switching occurs sometime during the calendar years t – 1 and t.
It would also make sense to use trade data for the calendar year t. This is done in section 8.6 where it is shown to
slightly improve the precision of our estimates.
20
While we report probit results, logit results are very similar.
18

15

India in the construction-architecture-engineering category is tiny, yet the category had huge
annual log changes of between –1.57 and 2.08. Since the sample variation in annual log changes
is greatest in industries where levels of inshoring and offshore outsourcing are low, it is not
surprising that annual log changes in inshoring and offshore outsourcing are not significant in
our switching probits.
The specification in equation (1) – log levels of inshoring and offshore outsourcing together
with fixed effects – exploits a very different source of sample variation than does annual changes.
An industry that experiences sustained inshoring growth has many years for which inshoring is
first well below and then well above the mean level for the industry. Restated, deviations of log
levels around the fixed effect are large. The sample variation exploited in equation (1) is
therefore driven by sustained growth of inshoring and offshore outsourcing. It is this sustained
growth that is most likely to have influenced employer decisions about hiring, firing, and pay
and employee decisions about switching.
The usefulness of a specification with log levels and fixed effects stems, then, from the fact
that inshoring and offshore outsourcing have been in a prolonged period of sustained growth.
Recall that in 1996 there was very little inshoring or offshore outsourcing with China and India.
India gained prominence only in the late 1990s when it established itself as a home to cheap
programmers who could solve Y2K bugs. Offshore outsourcing of services was not viewed as
an essential business practice until the time of the tech bubble. See the counts of media reports
in Amiti and Wei (2005a). Thus, the big-picture source of sample variation has been the steady
rise of inshoring and offshore outsourcing since 1996, not its annual fluctuations. Our equation
(1) specification exploits this big-picture sample variation.

5.2. Basic Results

The top panel of table 3 reports the probit estimates of equation (1). For all the probits in this
paper, we report marginal probabilities rather than slope coefficients e.g., we report
∂ Φ ∂ ln( M CI
j ,t −1 ) rather than β. Consider column 1. It reports the marginal probabilities for the
CI
impact of ln( M CI
j ,t −1 ) and ln( X j ,t −1 ) on industry switching for the industry-exposed sample. A

one log point increase in ln(M CI
j ,t −1 ) raises the probability of switching by 0.025. Most of the
public debate has centered on this offshore outsourcing effect. The often overlooked
phenomenon is inshoring i.e., ln( X CI
j ,t −1 ) . Its marginal probability is –0.031 which indicates that
a one log point increase in inshoring reduces the probability of industry switching by 0.031.
Before discussing coefficient magnitudes there are a few other features of the table that should
be explained. First, coefficients on Wi in equation (1) do not appear in the table, but are reported
in appendix table A.6. Second, we do not report the equation (1) fixed effects. Third, since we
are examining the effects of industry-level variables on individuals, the standard errors are
clustered at the industry level.
Column 2 of table 7 reports the marginal probabilities of 4-digit occupation switching. It
differs from column 1 in two subtle but important ways. First, the sample has changed from the
industry-exposed sample to the occupation-exposed sample. Second, the trade data are no longer
mapped into Census industries. Instead, they are mapped into Census occupations. (Recall that
appendix tables A.3 and A.4 report the mappings from the BEA’s international trade
classification into Census industries and occupations, respectively.)
The remaining columns re-estimate the probits for sub-populations i.e., for college graduates,
for all workers excluding college graduates (non-college graduates), for skilled white-collar
workers and for less-skilled white-collar workers. For each of these, a column heading of ‘Ind.’
17

means industry switching estimated using the industry-exposed sample and industry-level trade
flows. A column heading of ‘Occ.’ means occupation switching estimated using the occupationexposed sample and occupation-level trade flows.
There are a large number of marginal probabilities to examine. It is therefore worth starting
with some broad conclusions. First, the marginal probabilities for ln( M CI
j ,t −1 ) are always positive
and the marginal probabilities for ln( X CI
j ,t −1 ) are always negative. This means that the incidence
of switching is raised by offshore outsourcing and lowered by inshoring. For most specifications
the two marginal probabilities are statistically significant and in all but one case they are jointly
significant. See the row labeled ‘p-value for joint sig.’ Second, the marginal probability for
ln( M CI
j ,t −1 ) is the same for all worker types: it is about 0.025 for industry switching and 0.015 for

occupation switching. In contrast, the marginal probability for ln( X CI
j ,t −1 ) is about twice as large
for college graduates and skilled white-collar workers as it is for non-college graduates and lessskilled white-collar workers.21 This means that non-college workers and less-skilled white-collar
workers are taking a hit from offshore outsourcing without getting the benefits from inshoring.

5.3. Coefficient Magnitudes

Assessing whether the coefficients are large or small can be subjective so we will use several
criteria. The median industry in table 1 experienced annual changes in inshoring and offshore
outsourcing of about 0.10 log points. Multiplying the marginal probabilities in table 3 by 0.10
yields small impacts. Another way of thinking about magnitudes is to ask what would happen if
inshoring and offshore outsourcing trends over the nine-year span of 1996-2005 continued for

21

To see this either compare the industry switching columns 3 and 7 with 5 and 9 or compare the occupation
switching columns 4 and 8 with 6 and 10.

18

another nine years. From table 1, inshoring would increase by 0.99 log points and offshore
outsourcing would increase by 0.18 log points.22 From column 1 of table 3, this implies that
offshore outsourcing raised the incidence of switching by a tiny 0.005 (= 0.025 × 0.18) while
inshoring reduced the incidence by a much larger –0.031 (= –0.031 × 0.99). Applying this
analysis to all columns in table 3, it is immediately obvious that the inshoring effect dominates
the offshore outsourcing effect so that the net impact of inshoring and offshore outsourcing is to
reduce the incidence of switching.
A very different way of assessing coefficient magnitudes is what is best described as a fearmongering experiment. It will be used repeatedly in what follows. From table 1, the growth of
offshore outsourcing has been spectacular in business, professional and technical services (BPT).
If all inshoring and offshore outsourcing grew over the next nine years as it did for BPT during
1996-2005, then from table 1 offshore outsourcing would increase by 1.45 log points (≈ 0.16 × 9)
and inshoring would increase by 1.23 log points (≈ 0.14 × 9). We emphasize that this is a fearmongering exercise because it extrapolates based on the most rapidly growing major segment of
service trade. Such rapid growth would result in a 0.002 reduction in the incidence of industry
switching: 0.002 = (0.025 × 1.45) – (0.031 × 1.23). This result is reported in the row labeled
‘Rapid-Growth Effect.’ (We find this to be a more neutral term than the ‘fear-mongering effect.’)
Looking across columns, the rapid-growth effect is almost always negative. The two exceptions
are for non-college and less-skilled white-collar industry switchers. Thus, even a fear-mongering
exercise yields overall reductions in switching.
Since the rapid-growth effects are not statistically significant, we can take fear-mongering the
extra mile by looking at the upper bound of the 95 percent confidence intervals for the rapidgrowth effect. This gives us an upper limit on the worst that could happen to American workers
22

Multiply by 9 the numbers for China and India in the ‘total’ row of table 1 i.e., 0.99 = 0.11×9 and 0.18 = 0.02×9.

19

under the already extreme rapid-growth scenario: industry switching would rise by 0.032 and
occupation switching would rise by 0.007. These strike us as small increases in switching for a
worst-case-plus scenario that stretches over nine years.

5.4. Isolating the Low-Wage Effect

As discussed earlier, there are two reasons for the growth of inshoring and offshore outsourcing
with China and India. The first is technological change in ICT which allowed all countries to
engage in inshoring and offshore outsourcing. The second is economic liberalization in China
and India which allowed workers in these low-wage countries to compete with skilled American
workers. It is the latter aspect – low-wage competition for skilled white-collar jobs – that has
caught the public’s attention. It is therefore of interest to isolate it. Let M Gj ,t8−1 be U.S. offshore
outsourcing to G8 countries in industry j in year t – 1 and let X Gj ,t8−1 be the corresponding U.S.
inshoring from the G8. In the lower panel of table 3, we re-estimate equation (1) after replacing
G8
CI
G8
our trade measures with ln (M CI
j ,t −1 / M j ,t −1 ) and ln (X j ,t −1 / X j ,t −1 ) . The rationale for dividing by

G8 flows is that technological change in ICT led to an expansion of inshoring and offshore
G8
outsourcing to all countries so that ln (M CI
j ,t −1 / M j ,t −1 ) captures that component of offshore

outsourcing that is unique to China and India i.e., that is driven primarily by endowments of lowpaid skilled labor.
To evaluate this rationale for using the G8 as a control, we constructed a rudimentary measure
of the ICT costs of outsourcing, ICTjt, which builds on work by Bartel, Lach and Sicherman
(2005) and McKinsey Global Institute (2003). See appendix 4 for details. As shown in appendix
CI
figure A.1, ICTjt is highly correlated with ln(M CI
j ,t −1 ) (t = 7.40) and ln( X j ,t −1 ) (t = 6.31). On the

20

CI
G8
G8
other hand, ICTjt is uncorrelated with ln (M CI
j ,t −1 / M j ,t −1 ) (t = 1.82) and ln ( X j ,t −1 / X j ,t −1 ) (t =
G8
CI
G8
0.69). This supports our claim that ln (M CI
j ,t −1 / M j ,t −1 ) and ln (X j ,t −1 / X j ,t −1 ) purges pure ICT

effects and captures what is unique about China and India, namely, low wages for skilled
workers.
From the bottom panel of table 3, the coefficients on inshoring and offshore outsourcing have
the expected signs in all but one case and are almost all statistically significant. The magnitudes
have changed somewhat and this is best summarized by the rapid-growth effect row. Little has
changed for the occupation-exposed sample, but the rapid-growth effect for the industry-exposed
sample is more negative than in the upper panel. There is thus more consistency now between
the industry and occupation rapid-growth effects. More importantly, the big picture remains the
same: a small or zero reduction in switching due to inshoring and offshore outsourcing.

5.5. Endogeneity

A final issue is the endogeneity of the service trade flows in the upper panel of table 3. It is
possible that technological change in ICT is driving changes in trade flows and having
independent effects on switching. If so then the trade variables are spuriously picking up the
effects of ICT technology change.

Since we know from section 5.4 and appendix 4 that

G8
CI
G8
developments in ICT are uncorrelated with ln (M CI
j ,t −1 / M j ,t −1 ) and ln (X j ,t −1 / X j ,t −1 ) , we can use
CI
these as instruments for ln( M CI
j ,t −1 ) and ln( X j ,t −1 ) . This leaves us with a just-identified model.

The first-stage regressions appear in appendix A.7. The second-stage probits appear in columns
1 and 2 of table 4. We use the two-stage IV procedure described in Wooldridge (2001, p. 474).
The ‘Exogeneity’ rows of table 4 indicate that we cannot reject endogeneity. For industry
switching, the OLS and IV marginal probabilities of inshoring and offshore outsourcing are

21

nevertheless almost identical. For occupation switching, the IV results are larger than the OLS
results, but the inshoring marginal probability remains much larger than the offshore outsourcing
marginal probability so that the rapid-growth effect for IV (-0.019) and OLS (-0.023) are very
similar. In short, both the OLS and IV estimates imply that inshoring and offshore outsourcing
had no net effect on industry switching (the industry-exposed sample), but did reduce occupation
switching (the occupation-exposed sample).

5.6. Sensitivity Analysis

Our results will turn out to be insensitive to a large variety of specification changes. These
include broadening the list of low-wage countries beyond just China and India (table 7), deleting
the technology-bubble years (table 8), correcting for CPS sample selection (table 9), including all
private sector workers rather than just those exposed to offshore outsourcing and inshoring (table
10), using different definitions of switching (table 11) and more. We defer this discussion until
section 8.

6. An Econometric Analysis of Unemployment

We next turn to impacts on weeks spent unemployed as a share of total weeks in the labor force.
This measure of unemployment was proposed by Murphy and Topel (1987). We estimate the
following linear regression:

∆(

unemployed weeksit
CI
) = θ ( ∆Wit ) + β ln( M CI
j ,t −1 ) + γ ln( X j ,t −1 ) + λ j + λo + λt + λr + ε it
weeks in labor forceit

(2)

where the dependent variable is the change between t – 1 and t in the share of labor force weeks

22

spent unemployed. Since we are working in changes, we first difference Wit. This leaves only
experience squared in ∆Wit.23
Since we will be arguing that the estimates of β and γ in equation (2) are small, we will need a
benchmark for coefficient magnitudes. Let σU, σX and σM be the standard deviations of the
CI
dependent variable, ln( M CI
j ,t −1 ) and ln( X j ,t −1 ) , respectively. One modest benchmark is to require

that one-standard-deviation changes in inshoring or offshore outsourcing change the dependent
variable by at least σU/10. This implies coefficients for inshoring of at least 0.01 in absolute
value and coefficients for offshore outsourcing of at least 0.008. 24 An alternative modest
benchmark would be an effect that reduced the share of time spent unemployed by at least 0.01
over nine years (i.e., over 1996-2005). This implies coefficients on inshoring of at least 0.008 in
absolute value and coefficients on offshore outsourcing of at least 0.007. Summarizing, both
modest benchmarks lead one to expect coefficients of at least 0.007 in absolute value. Any
coefficient less than this would have to be considered tiny relative to all the hype surrounding
offshore outsourcing.
A quick perusal of table 5 reveals that every coefficient is less than 0.007 in absolute value.
Further, even though statistical significance is often very low, every coefficient has a 1 percent
confidence interval that lies strictly within the interval (–0.007, 0.007). Thus, we have precisely
estimated very small effects of inshoring and offshore outsourcing on the share of labor-force
weeks spent unemployed.
The rapid-growth effects are mostly negative and, where statistically significant, always
negative. This means that the net of effect of inshoring and offshore outsourcing has been to
23

The only time-varying variables in Wit are experience and experience squared. The change in experience is always
1 and so ends up in the intercept.
24
σU = 0.11, σX = 0.97 and σM = 1.43 so that σU / σX = 0.11 and σU / σM = 0.08. These last two numbers are then
divided by 10.

23

reduce the share of labor-force weeks spent unemployed. Further, the rapid growth effects are
always less than 0.007 in absolute value and so are small as judged by our benchmarks.
The IV results appear in columns 3 and 4 of table 4 and do not alter these conclusions. For
the industry sample, the IV and OLS coefficients are the same size but the IV coefficients are
much more significant. For the occupation sample, the coefficients are insignificant for both IV
and OLS. To conclude, inshoring and offshore outsourcing combined likely reduced time spent
unemployed and the net effect is precisely estimated to be small.

7. An Econometric Analysis of Earnings

There is by now a very large empirical literature analyzing the impact of trade openness on wage
levels and the distribution of income e.g. Borjas, Freeman and Katz (1992), Lawrence and
Slaughter (1993), Gaston and Trefler (1994, 1997), and Feenstra and Hanson (1996, 1999, 2002).
All of these are limited to manufacturing.

For the effect of exchange rates on both

manufacturing and services see Goldberg and Tracy (2003). We estimate the effect of service
inshoring and offshore outsourcing on earnings using the following linear regression:

CI
∆ ln(earningsit ) = θ∆Wit + β ln( M CI
j ,t −1 ) + γ ln( X j ,t −1 ) + λ j + λo + λt + λr + ε it

(3)

Table 6 reports the results. Consider column 1 first. It reports the results for the industryexposed sample using industry-level imports. The coefficient on offshore outsourcing is small
and implies that even if ln( M CI
j ,t −1 ) grew for nine-years at 16 percent a year, as in the rapidgrowth effect, earnings would only fall by 0.01 percent (= –0.0001×0.016×9). This is tiny. The
corresponding number for ln( X CI
j ,t −1 ) is an earnings rise of 0.73 percent (= 0.006×0.014×9).

24

When the results are broken down by education we find small but precisely estimated effects
for college graduates. For non-college graduates we obtain a surprising reversal of signs. This is
possibly explained by selection.

To explore, we distinguish between switchers and non-

switchers. Column 7 reports results for workers who did not switch industries. For these workers,
inshoring had a small effect on earnings, offshore outsourcing had no effect and the rapid-growth
effect was small (a nine-year earnings increase of 0.7 percent, t = 3.28). Column 8 reports
results for workers who switched from one exposed industry to another. Now the expected sign
pattern appears but the effects are small and insignificant. Column 9 reports results for workers
who switched from an exposed industry to an unexposed industry. There is no effect of either
inshoring or offshore outsourcing for these workers.25
These results for switchers versus non-switchers are interesting, but do not explain why noncollege graduates have an unexpected sign on the coefficient for offshore outsourcing. Column
10 points to the role of young workers. Workers between the ages of 18 and 24 are the source of
the unexpected sign.
Returning to the big picture, all the table 6 estimated coefficients are small and have
sufficiently small standard errors that we can have some confidence in claiming that inshoring
and offshore outsourcing have had either zero or small positive effects on earnings, selection
notwithstanding.

25

Appendix table A.8 presents a transition matrix that tracks where switchers go and what this means for their
earnings. 30 percent of workers in the industry-exposed sample switch their 4-digit industries. 10 of these 30
percentage points involve workers who move to other exposed industries. These workers see their earnings rise by
0.01 log points in the year of transition. This is likely due to selection: at least some of the workers who move from
one exposed industry to another do so because of better prospects in the new industry. Another 9 of these 30
percentage points involve workers who move to unexposed service industries. They experience an earnings loss of
0.11 log points. Finally, 4 of these 30 percent involve workers who switch to wholesale and retail trade and take an
earnings hit of 0.15 log points. Somewhat similar numbers hold for occupation switchers in the occupation-exposed
sample. See appendix table A.8 for details.

25

8. Sensitivity to Alternative Specifications

We have precisely estimated small effects of inshoring and offshore outsourcing on occupation
switching, industry switching, weeks unemployed as a share of labor force weeks, and earnings.
The remainder of this paper shows that our results are not sensitive to (1) the inclusion of other
low-wage countries, (2) the exclusion of the years in which the technology bubble collapsed
(2000-2001), (3) modeling the selection of workers into our March-to-March matched sample, (4)
the inclusion of all private service workers in the analysis, not just exposed private service
workers, (5) alternative definitions of our dependent variables (1-digit switching, transitions
from employment to unemployment, hourly wages), (6) the use of contemporaneous trade flows
rather than lagged trade flows, and (7) exclusion of all industries except business, professional
and technical services.

The results appear in tables 7-13 and are quite stable across

specifications. In the few instances where an estimate becomes significant where previously it
was not (at the 1 percent level) or becomes insignificant where previously it was significant, this
is flagged in boldface in tables 7-13. Since our results are similar for each of these alternative
specifications reported below, there will be no new important insights and a reader who already
believes that our results are robust can jump straight to the conclusions.

8.1. Beyond China and India: Expanding the Set of Low-Wage Countries

When it comes to U.S. trade in services, China and India are by far the major low-wage trading
partners.

The BEA also publishes bilateral service trade data for all countries that have

significant service trade with the United States. Among low-wage countries, data are available
for China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. We therefore redefine
CI
M CI
j ,t −1 and X j ,t −1 to be service trade with all six of these low-wage countries. Table 7 reports the

26

results of re-estimating equations (1)-(3) with this redefinition. Columns 1-3 correspond to
column 1 of tables 3, 5 and 6, respectively. Columns 4-6 correspond to column 2 of tables 3, 5
and 6, respectively. From the bold-faced numbers, significance changes slightly in only three
cases. All three have the right sign. Two become significant (columns 3 and 4) and one
becomes insignificant (column 6).

In all cases there is virtually no change in coefficient

magnitudes.

8.2. Sensitivity to the Technology Bubble

NASDAQ began its precipitous decline in March 2000 and continued to decline until mid-2002.
As noted by Mann (2003), early research on offshore outsourcing was unable to disentangle the
effects of offshore outsourcing from the effects of the bursting bubble. We now have a longer
data series with more post-bubble data. Nevertheless, to eliminate the effects of the bubble we
delete all data for the years 2000 and 2001. Table 8 reports the results. The one change is an
earnings coefficient that becomes insignificant. (See the boldfaced estimate.) However, our
main conclusions are unchanged.

8.3. Sample Selection Resulting from Unmatched Workers

To be in our matched sample a worker must remain in the same dwelling from March of year t to
March of year t + 1. Since offshore outsourcing may encourage workers to move in search of
jobs, our sample may not be randomly chosen and our estimates may be tainted by sample
selection bias. See Neumark and Kawaguchi (2004) and Goldberg and Tracy (2003). In this
section we use maximum likelihood to simultaneously estimate two equations, a selection
equation and a second-stage equation (switching, unemployment or earnings). Our specification

27

of the selection equation borrows from the migration literature which shows that mobility is
strongly tied to family characteristics that have been excluded from our second-stage equations.
These are family size, number of children, home ownership and whether the individual has a
recent history of moving as proxied by whether the individual lived in the same house last year.26
These instruments are drawn from responses in the first of the two March surveys.
The estimates appear in table 9. Estimates of the second-stage equations appear in the top
panel while estimates of the selection equation appear in the bottom panel. The Wald test for
selection is reported in the row labeled ‘Wald test of indep. Eqns.’ and indicates that in almost
every case selection bias cannot be rejected.27 Selection affects the fixed effects and the workercharacteristic coefficients, but does not affect our estimates of inshoring and offshore
outsourcing. The latter estimates do not change in any economically significant way.

8.4. Exploiting Differences between Exposed and Unexposed Workers

In section 4, we characterized industries with a binary variable indicating whether or not the
industry was exposed to inshoring and offshore outsourcing. We then compared the labor-force
outcomes of exposed and unexposed workers.

In sections 5-7, we characterized exposed

CI
industries with continuous measures of exposure ( ln( M CI
j ,t −1 ) and ln( X j ,t −1 ) ). We then dropped

unexposed workers from the analysis and regressed the outcomes of exposed workers on
CI
ln( M CI
j ,t −1 ) and ln( X j ,t −1 ) .

In this section we combine the two approaches by including

unexposed workers in our regression analysis.

26

In the first of the two March surveys the individual is asked if he or she lived in the same house last year. The
correlation of this response with whether the individual is matched across March surveys is 0.14. This is a small
correlation and our results are unchanged when this variable is removed from the instrument set.
27
The Wald test is calculated by comparing the results in table 9 with the results of fitting the second-stage equation
without a selection correction.

28

To this end we introduce an exposure dummy for whether the individual is in the exposed
sample (D = 1) or the unexposed sample (D = 0). We also introduce a period dummy for
whether or not the year is in the second half of our sample where offshore outsourcing was at far
higher levels. The period dummy equals 1 in 2001-2006 and 0 in 1996-2000. To obtain a
double difference we interact the exposure and period dummies. We expect the interaction to be
negative for earnings, which means that the earnings of exposed workers relative to unexposed
workers have declined in recent years as offshore outsourcing intensified. Likewise, we expect
the interaction term to be positive for switching and unemployment. The results appear in table
10 where the interactions are statistically insignificant everywhere. See the rows labeled ‘Diffof-Diff’.28 Thus, including workers in unexposed industries does not affect our conclusions.

8.5. Alternative Dependent Variables

So far, all of our switching results were based on 4-digit industry switching. In columns 1 and 4
of table 11 we report results for 1-digit switching. We expect these estimates to be smaller and
indeed they are about half the size of the estimates for 4-digit switching. Interestingly, the
inshoring coefficient for the industry-exposed sample now becomes significant. Thus, even at
the 1-digit switching level it remains true that the growth of inshoring and offshore outsourcing
has been associated with small but statistically significant (t = –5.84) reductions in industry
switching.
So far, we have defined changes in unemployment in terms of changes in the proportion of
labor-force hours spent unemployed.
28

An alternative definition is a binary indicator of

The estimates for ln( M CI
and ln( X CI
j ,t −1 ) do not change much from our baselines: the rapid growth effect
j ,t −1 )

continues to imply small but positive impacts of inshoring and offshore outsourcing. There is the issue of what to do
about the trade flows of unexposed workers since by definition these workers have no trade in their industries and
occupations. We therefore set the inshoring and offshore outsourcing variables to zero for unexposed workers. (It
does not matter that it is zero because the fixed effects absorb any time-invariant constant.)

29

transitioning from employment to unemployment. If the worker is employed in the March
reference week of year t and becomes unemployed in the March reference week of year t + 1, we
assign 1 to the binary indicator of unemployment. If the worker is employed in the March
reference week of year t and the March reference week of year t + 1, we assign 0 to the binary
indicator of unemployment. A worker who is unemployed in the March reference week of year t
is dropped from the sample regardless of employment status in t + 1. (Unemployed workers in t
are dropped only in this subsection.) Columns 2 and 5 of table 11 present estimated marginal
probabilities of a probit for transitioning to unemployment. The only major change from our
previous results is that inshoring now significantly reduces transitions into unemployment for
both the industry- and occupation-exposed samples.

However, the coefficients remain

economically small.
We also re-estimated our earnings regressions using the change in real hourly wages as the
dependent variable. Hourly wages are defined as real annual earnings divided by hours worked
last year. Hours worked last year is weeks worked last year times hours worked each week. The
inshoring coefficient in column 3΄ is no longer significant (the industry-exposed sample).
However, all of the coefficients remain as small as in our baseline specification.

8.6. Contemporaneous Rather than Lagged Trade Variables

The dependent variables typically involve changes between year t – 1 and t. To reduce issues of
CI
endogeneity, we lagged the trade variables so that ln(M CI
j ,t −1 ) and ln( X j ,t −1 ) were used in place

CI
of ln( M CI
jt ) and ln( X jt ) .

In table 12, we re-estimate our equations (1)-(3) using

contemporaneous trade variables rather than lagged ones. As is apparent from the table, this
tends to raise t-statistics without altering coefficient magnitudes.

8.7. Business, Professional and Technical (BPT) Services

Much of the press about offshore outsourcing focuses on BPT services to the exclusion of the
other service categories in table 1 such as financial and insurance services. That is, the press
focuses on services for which U.S. comparative advantage is relatively weak. Table 13 presents
estimates of our equations (1)-(3) when only the eight BPT service subcategories are included in
the analysis. One might expect this to increase the coefficients on offshore outsourcing and
decrease the coefficients on inshoring.

This does not happen.

occupation switching the reverse happens.

Indeed, for industry and

Consequently, the net effect of inshoring and

offshore outsourcing on switching is now more favorable to American workers. This can be seen
from the fear-mongering, rapid-growth effect which implies a large reduction in switching:
–0.035 (t = –11.45) for industry switching and –0.065 (t = –1.94) for occupation switching.

8.7. Conclusions from Sensitivity Analysis

As is apparent from tables 7-13, our main conclusions survive the many alternative specifications
presented in this section.

9. Conclusions

The rise of service offshore outsourcing to China and India has brought with it something new –
for the first time ever, educated U.S. workers are competing with educated but low-paid foreign
workers.

Despite the public concern about this development, there has been almost no

econometric work on the subject. Most previous studies have simply counted the number of
workers who are in industries or occupations that are exposed to offshore outsourcing. Many

31

(but not all) of these studies then conclude from the resulting large counts that bad things must
be happening to American workers. We came up with similar large counts using CPS data, but
then went on to ask about actual as opposed to conjectured effects on U.S. labor markets. In so
doing we emphasized that one cannot ignore the reverse flow (inshoring), which is the sale of
services produced in the United States to unaffiliated buyers in China and India.
Using March-to-March matched CPS data for 1996-2006 we examined the impacts of
inshoring and offshore outsourcing on (1) occupation and industry switching, (2) weeks spent
unemployed as a share of weeks in the labor force, and (3) earnings. We precisely estimated
small positive effects of inshoring and smaller negative effects of offshore outsourcing. The net
effect of inshoring and offshore outsourcing was positive. We quantified this net effect using
something of a fear-mongering experiment which we called the rapid-growth effect. Suppose
that over the next nine years inshoring and offshore outsourcing continued to grow at rates
experienced during 1996-2005 in business, professional and technical services i.e., in segments
where China and India have been particularly strong. Then for workers in occupations that are
exposed to offshore outsourcing (i) 4-digit occupational switching would decline by 2 percent, (ii)
the share of weeks spent unemployed would fall by 0.1 percent and (iii) earnings would rise by
1.5 percent. That is, American workers on average would benefit. Of course, these numbers are
not annual changes – they are changes over nine years – and thus represent small benefits. The
important take away is that this extreme, fear-mongering exercise does not produce adverse
impacts on U.S. workers.
There are some darker spots in the U.S. labor market experience with offshore outsourcing.
For workers in industries exposed to offshore outsourcing, the effects tend to be smaller (i.e. less
positive). The effects tend to be negative for workers without a college degree or who work in

32

less-skilled, white-collar jobs. As with all labor-market impacts of international trade, there are
winners and losers and, in the current U.S., the losers are less educated. We do not want to
minimize the effect on losers.

The loss of one’s job can be enormously damaging both

financially and psychologically.
These darker spots should not be allowed to obscure the big picture. All of these effects are
remarkably small given the hype associated with offshore outsourcing. Further, they were
estimated with sufficient precision that even the upper bounds of 95 percent confidence intervals
involved small effects.

The estimates were also shown to hold across a wide variety of

alternative specifications (section 8). There can thus be only one way of describing the hype
surrounding the labor-market impacts of inshoring and offshore outsourcing: Much Ado About
Nothing.

Appendix 1. Trade Data
All data are from the ‘other private services’ category of the BEA database. We exclude (i)
Installation, maintenance, and repair of equipment, (ii) Education, and (iii) Other because these
categories are difficult to concord into industries and occupations. In this we follow van Welsum
and Vickery (2005).
In 2003, the CPS updated its industry and occupation classifications from 1990 Census codes
to 2002 Census codes. To ensure that codes are consistent over our entire sample we converted
the 1990 Census codes into 2002 Census codes. We then linked 2002 Census industry or
occupation codes with BEA types of service trade. In order to do this as accurately as possible
we used (i) the 2002 NAICS manual for detailed industry definitions and the 2000 SOC manual
for detailed occupation definitions, and (ii) Borga and Mann (2004) and U.S. Department of
Commerce (1998) for detailed information about the coverage of each type of trade in services.
Our measures of inshoring and offshore outsourcing in services come from published BEA
data on U.S. international services cross-border trade and sales through affiliates. Data for early
years are sporadically missing. This could either be because values of less than 0.5 million
dollars are suppressed or because of disclosure concerns. The two likely go hand in hand: even
a quick look through the data for each industry shows that when data are missing in a year there
are usually neighboring years with data and these data involve very small values of trade. We
therefore used linear interpolation to fill in missing data. However, none of our main results
change when we restrict ourselves to non-imputed data.
Appendix 2. Switching
Responses to questions about industry and occupation in the longest job held last year are known
to be frequently miscoded. This leads to overestimation of switching. We therefore clean up the
raw switching data using the yearly equivalent of the criteria in Moscarini and Thomsson (2006).
Specifically, a switch is valid only if at least one of the following three events occurred. (1) The
class of worker changed. (2) There was job search during the period.29 (3) For an industry
(occupation) switch the occupation (industry) changed. Note that in most cases, criterion (3) was
satisfied only when either (1) or (2) were satisfied. That is, criterion (3) does not have much
bite. On a separate issue, see appendix 1 for a discussion of 2003 changes in Census definitions
of occupations and industries.
Appendix 3. Skills
Skills are defined by 1-digit Census major occupations. (1) Unskilled blue-collar workers:
farming, fishing, and forestry occupations; construction and extraction occupations; production
occupations; transportation and material moving occupations. (2) Skilled blue-collar workers:
installation, maintenance, and repair occupations. (3) Less-skilled white-collar workers: service
occupations; sales and related occupations; office and administrative support occupations. (4)
Skilled white-collar workers: management, business and financial occupations; professional and
related occupations.
Appendix 4. The Relationship of ICT to Inshoring and Offshore Outsourcing
CI
We have argued that ln (M CI
jt ) and ln ( X jt ) are determined in part by technical change in ICT
29

In the variable coding of LOOKED, a worker looked for a job last year if she worked last year (_WORKYN=1),
was a part-year worker (1<=WKSLYR<=51) and looked for work last year (LKEDPY=0).

34

and in part by political developments in China and India that led to an opening up of these
economies. We also argued that the technical change aspects could be controlled for by
ln (M Gjt 8 ) and ln (X Gjt 8 ) . The argument was that if trends in inshoring and offshore outsourcing
were exclusively driven by technical change then they might be expected to affect all trading
G8
CI
G8
partners equally. In particular, we argued that trends in ln (M CI
jt / M jt ) and ln (X jt / X jt ) were
driven primarily by political developments in China and India. To assess this claim we introduce
a rudimentary measure of the importance of ICT change in industry j. For service industry j let
ICT_Intensityj be investment in ICT equipment and software divided by total new equipment and
software investment. This measure was suggested in U.S. Department of Commerce (2003) and
is used by Bartel, Lach and Sicherman (2005) in their examination of outsourcing and
technological change. We extracted the data for ICT_Intensityj from the BEA 1997 capital flow
table. Let Telecom_Costt be a time trend that captures technical change over time. We obtain
almost identical results whether we use a time trend or the annual leasing cost of a 2 Mbps fiber
cable between New York and Mumbai (McKinsey Global Institute, 2003). Our measure of ICT
in industry j in year t is:
ICT jt = ICT _ Intensity j × Telecom _ Costt .

G8
CI
G8
is no relationship: t = 1.82 for ln (M CI
jt / M jt ) and t = 0.69 for ln (X jt / X jt ) . This supports our
claim that the ratio of China-India activity relative to G8 activity is orthogonal to ICT technical
change. The ratio is instead driven by political economy developments unique to China and
India.
Finally note that if we include ICTjt directly into our regressions it has no effect on our
estimates.

Notes : 'Year' is the year of the individual's first March survey. Columns 1, 4, and 7 report means for the occupation-exposed sample.
Columns 2, 5, and 8 report the difference of means for the exposed sample less the unexposed sample. The unexposed sample consists
of private workers in service occupations that are not exposed to inshoring and offshore outsourcing. See section 4 for details.
Columns 3, 6, and 9 report t -statistics for the differences. The top panel reports occupation switching at the 4-digit level. The bottom
panel reports occupation switching at other levels.

Worker characteristics
and fixed effects

Notes : Each column presents two separate probits, the top panel with M CI and X CI and the bottom panel with M CI /M G8 and X CI /X G8 . Each
probit includes worker characteristics (experience, experience squared, years of schooling and dummies for sex, race, marital status and
veteran status) as well as fixed effects for 2-digit industries, 2-digit occupations, year and state. In odd-numberd columns the dependent
variable is 4-digit industry switching and the sample is the industry-exposed sample. In even-numberd columns the dependent variable is 4digit occupation switching and the sample is the occupation-exposed sample. Marginal probabilities are reported. t -statistics adjusted for
clustering at the industry level (odd columns) or the occupation level (even columns) are in parentheses. 'p -value for joint sig.' is the test for
the joint significance of the two trade variables. A number less than 0.01 indicates significance. 'Rapid-growth effect' is 1.45 times the
marginal probability of the offshore outsourcing variable plus 1.23 times the marginal probability of the inshoring variable.

Change in worker

Notes : The dependent variable is the change in unemployed weeks as a share of total weeks in the labor force. Each column presents
two separate OLS regressions, the top panel with M CI and X CI and the bottom panel with M CI /M G8 and X CI /X G8 . The regressions
include the change in time-varying worker characteristics (change in experience squared) as well as fixed effects for 2-digit industries, 2digit occupations, year and state. The sample alternates between columns. The industry-exposed sample is in odd-numberd columns
and the occupation-exposed sample is in even-numberd columns. t -statistics adjusted for clustering at the industry level (odd columns)
or occupation level (even columns) are in parentheses. 'p -value for joint sig.' is the joint test for the significance of the two trade
variables. A number less than 0.01 indicates significance. 'Rapid-growth effect' is 1.45 times the coefficient on the offshore
outsourcing variable plus 1.23 times the coefficient on the inshoring variable.

(change in experience squared) as well as fixed effects for 2-digit industries, 2-digit occupations, year and state. The 'Ind.' columns use the
industry-exposed sample and the 'Occ.' columns use the occupation-exposed sample. t -statistics adjusted for clustering at the industry level
('Ind.' columns) or the occupation level ('Occ.' columns) are in parentheses. 'p -value for joint sig.' is the joint test for the significance of the
two trade variables. A number less than 0.01 indicates significance. 'Rapid-growth effect' is 1.45 times the coefficient on the offshore
outsourcing variable plus 1.23 times the coefficient on the inshoring variable.

Notes : In this table the service trade variables have been redefined to include not just China and India, but all other lowwage countries for which data are available. Marginal probabilities from probits are reported in columns 1 and 4. OLS
estimates are reported in the remaining columns. t -statistics are in parentheses and are clustered at the industry level (for
the industry sample) or the occupation level (for the occupation sample). Columns 1 and 4 correspond to columns 1-2 of
table 3. Columns 2 and 5 correspond to columns 1-2 of table 5. Columns 3 and 6 correspond to columns 1-2 of table 6.
See the notes to those tables for additional information. A bolded estimate means that its statistical significance has
changed from that in the baseline specifications of tables 3, 5, or 6. In particular, the coefficient has gone from
significant to insignificant or from insignificant to significant.

Notes: In this table, second-stage equations are simultaneously estimated together with a selection equation. The latter is a probit for whether a worker entering the sample in
period t is matched in period t +1. For the selection equation, coefficients are reported. For the second-stage equations, marginal probabilities are reported in columns 1 and
4 and coefficients are reported in the remaining columns. t -statistics are in parentheses and are clustered at the industry level (for the industry sample) or the occupation level
(for the occupation sample). Columns 1 and 4 correspond to columns 1-2 of table 3. Columns 2 and 5 correspond to columns 1-2 of table 5. Columns 3 and 6 correspond to
columns 1-2 of table 6. See the notes to those tables for additional information about the second-stage equations. A bolded estimate means that its statistical significance has
changed from that in the baseline specifications of tables 3, 5, or 6. In particular, the coefficient has gone from significant to insignificant or from insignificant to significant.

Notes : In this table we add to our sample those private service workers in unexposed industries (columns 1-3) or unexposed
occupations (columns 4-6). 'Exposure dummy' is a dummy for whether the worker is exposed (=1) or not (=0) to inshoring or offshore
outsourcing. 'Diff-of-Diff' is the interaction of the exposure dummy with a dummy for whether the year is in the 2001-2006 period (=
1) or not (= 0). For unexposed workers service trade is by definition 0 so that the inshoring and offshore outsourcing variables are set
to 0. The table is identical in structure to table 7. See the table 7 notes.

Notes : Column 1 (2) is a probit for 1-digit industry (occupation) switching. This differs from the 4-digit switching reported in all other
tables. Column 2 is a probit for a binary dependent variable which equals 1 if the worker went from being employed in March of year t to
being unemployed in March of year t + 1. Column 3 is a linear regression of the growth in hourly wages where hourly wages is defined as
real annual earnings divided by hours worked last year (weeks worked last year times hours worked each week). Marginal probabilities
from probits are reported in columns 1, 2, 4 and 5. OLS estimates are reported in the remaining columns. The table is identical in structure
to table 7. See the table 7 notes.

Notes : 'Naïve Match' is the proportion of all civilian
adults in March of the indicated year who can be
matched to an individual in March of the subsequent
year. The naïve match is based on a household identifier,
a household number, and an individual line number
within a household. 'Valid Match' is the percentage of
naïve matches that survive the S|R|A (sex, race, age)
merge criterion. 'Final Match' is the final match rate and
equals (naïve match)x(valid match).

Notes : Columns 1 and 2 report means and standard deviations for the industry-exposed sample. Column 3 is the difference
between private service workers aged 18-64 in exposed less unexposed industries. See section 4 for a discussion. An asterisk
(*) indicates that the difference is statistically significant at the 1% level. Columns 4-6 are the corresponding statistics for the
occupation-exposed sample.

Notes : This table reports the coefficients on the worker characteristic controls. Columns 1 and 4 go with columns 1 and 2 of table 3,
respectively. Columns 2 and 5 go with columns 1 and 2 of table 5, respectively. Columns 3 and 6 go with columns 1 and 2 of table 6,
respectively. Columns 1 and 4 report marginal probabilities while the remaining columns report OLS coefficients. t -statistics are
clustered at the industry or the occupation levels.
