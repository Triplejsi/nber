How Social Processes Distort Measurement: The Impact of Survey Nonresponse on Estimates
of Volunteer Work in the United States
Katharine G. Abraham, Sara E. Helms, and Stanley Presser
NBER Working Paper No. 14076
June 2008
JEL No. J01
ABSTRACT
Estimates of volunteering in the United States vary greatly from survey to survey and do not show the
decline over time common to other measures of social capital. We argue that these anomalies are
caused by the social processes that determine survey participation, in particular the propensity of people
who do volunteer work to respond to surveys at higher rates than those who do not do volunteer work.
Thus surveys with lower responses rates will usually have higher proportions of volunteers, and the
decline in response rates over time likely has led to increasing overrepresentation of volunteers. We
analyze data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) -- the sample for which is drawn from
Current Population Survey (CPS) respondents -- together with data from the CPS Volunteering Supplement
to demonstrate the effects of survey nonresponse on estimates of volunteering activity and its correlates.
CPS respondents who become ATUS respondents report much more volunteering in the CPS than
those who become ATUS nonrespondents. This difference is replicated within demographic and other
subgroups. Consequently, conventional statistical adjustments for nonresponse cannot correct the
resulting bias. Although nonresponse leads to estimates of volunteer activity that are too high, it generally
does not affect inferences about the characteristics associated with volunteer activity. We discuss
the implications of these findings for the study of other phenomena.

Volunteer work is an important component of economic activity in the United States
(Abraham and Mackie 2005) and it also plays a key role in noneconomic spheres of American
society (Wilson 2000). Who volunteers and why? What sorts of work do volunteers perform?
Have the amount and type of volunteer work changed over time? How does volunteering affect
volunteers? What cultural and political factors influence the amount and nature of volunteering
in a society? How does volunteering shape culture and the polity? These are among the
questions that make volunteering of interest across the social sciences.
Such questions are most often addressed with data from sample surveys. Troublingly,
however, surveys yield widely varying estimates of volunteering. For instance, the 2002
Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS), conducted by the Census Bureau, reported
that 28 percent of American adults were volunteers (Boraas, 2003); the 1996 National Household
Education Survey (NHES), conducted by Westat, reported a figure of 39 percent (National
Center for Education Statistics, 1997); and the 1996 Independent Sector (IS) survey, conducted
by the Gallup Poll, estimated 49 percent (Hodgkinson and Weitzman, 1996).
These surveys differed in many ways (including the precise definition of volunteering),
but one of the most pronounced differences was the proportion of sample members from whom
information was collected. The response rate to the CPS supplement was 82 percent (Census
Technical Documentation); the rate for NHES was 59 percent (National Center for Education
Statistics, 1997); and, although we have been unable to obtain the rate for the IS survey, Gallup
response rates rarely exceeded 40 percent. The variation in these rates corresponds to the
variation in the volunteering estimates – the higher the response rate the lower the volunteering
estimate.
Although this is, at best, suggestive evidence for the proposition that survey estimates of
volunteering are inversely related to survey response rates, such a proposition makes sense of a

second puzzling survey finding about volunteering: Change over time in volunteering appears
quite different from change over time in other forms of social capital. In Bowling Alone,
Putnam (2000: 127) noted that “Trends in volunteering over the last several decades are more
complicated and in some respects more intriguing than the uniform decline that characterizes
most dimensions of social capital in America in this period.” As shown in Figure 1, nationwide
Gallup surveys recorded a sharp increase between 1977 and 1991 in affirmative responses to the
question “Do you, yourself, happen to be involved in any charity or social service activities, such
as helping the poor, the sick or the elderly?” The percent of affirmative responses rose from 26
percent in 1977 to 46 percent in 1991.1
If these data are taken at face value, they indicate that volunteering in America almost
doubled in little more than a decade! But over this same period, survey response rates declined
markedly due to increasing difficulties in both contacting people and persuading them to be
interviewed (see Curtin, Presser, and Singer 2005, for the experiences of one major survey).
Response rates are not available for the Figure 1 surveys, but the Gallup Organization
experienced a general decline during this period similar to that of most survey organizations.
Further, the first five surveys shown in Figure 1 (from 1977 through 1986) were conducted faceto-face, whereas the other four (between 1987 and 1991) were conducted by telephone. Thus,
even apart from the general decline in response rates, the later studies would have had lower
response rates than the earlier ones because response rates are almost always lower on the phone
than in-person (Groves and Kahn, 1979). Moreover, the December 1987 survey, which
produced the highest estimate of volunteering, almost certainly had the lowest response rate, as it

1

The question wording in two of the surveys contained very minor variations. The December 1987 poll substituted
“Are you involved…” for “Do you, yourself, happen to be involved…” and the November 1989 poll deleted
“yourself” from “Do you, yourself, happen to be involved…” Also, the final entry (1991) is from a survey by
Princeton Survey Research Associates, which had been founded the previous year by individuals who had been
responsible for Gallup’s 1989 volunteering survey.

was conducted over only two days compared to seven days for the May 1987 survey and four
days for all the other surveys. (Shorter field periods produce lower response rates because they
allow less time to contact and persuade respondents.)2
FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE
Are there grounds for expecting that a survey’s response rate would affect its estimate of
volunteering? Although the potential for nonresponse bias grows as the level of nonresponse
increases, several recent studies, on a wide range of topics, have found that actual nonresponse
bias is largely unaffected by increases in the nonresponse rate. Keeter et al. (2000), Curtin,
Presser, and Singer (2000), and Merkle and Edelman (2002) report little, if any, link between
nonresponse rates and bias, and a meta-analysis by Groves (2006) shows only a weak
relationship between nonresponse level and bias in studies that had validation measures. These
results suggest that many of the variables measured in surveys are only slightly correlated, if at
all, with the causes of nonresponse (cf., Groves, Presser, and Dipko, 2004 and Abraham,
Maitland and Bianchi, 2006).

2

The only volunteering time series we know of for which published response rates are available is the American
National Election Study, which, beginning in 1992, asked the following question in five post-election surveys:
“Many people say they have less time these days to do volunteer work. What about you, were you able to devote
any time to volunteer work in the last 12 months?” The samples used for three of the five years were drawn in part
from respondents to earlier surveys. Unfortunately, this is not reflected in the published response rates, and we are
unable to compute the correct response rates for the total samples in those years. Instead, we present below the
results from the newly drawn portions of the samples. The new samples for 1996 and 2002 were quite small; in
addition, there were differences in the mode of administration across the surveys (2004 was conducted completely
in-person, 2002 completely by phone, and the others with varying percentages allocated to the two modes), which
complicates interpretation. Among the three surveys with samples large enough to produce reasonably precise
estimates (1992, 2000 and 2004), we observe the lowest percent volunteering in the sample with the highest
response rate (1992) and the highest percent volunteering in the sample with the lowest response rate (2000), though
the 2000 estimate is not significantly different from the 2004 estimate.

Volunteering is likely to be an exception to this pattern. The two major determinants of
response rate -- contactability (the ease of being able to make contact with an individual) and
amenability (an individual’s willingness to be interviewed) – both seem likely to be influenced
by the same factors that influence volunteering: social integration, altruism, and a sense of
responsibility. Indeed survey participation is similar to volunteering in that survey respondents
are asked to help an organization by giving their time (Knack, 1992).3 There is thus a theoretical
basis for expecting volunteering, as well as other pro-social or altruistic behaviors, to be related
to nonresponse and, therefore, to be overestimated in surveys.
Nonresponse bias is not the only form of error that may affect survey estimates of
volunteering (or other pro-social behavior). The estimates are also subject to recall error and
social desirability bias. These two problems are minimized in the American Time Use Survey
(ATUS), which, beginning in 2003, obtained detailed reports from a sample of Americans about
how they spent their time on the day preceding the interview (Bureau of Labor Statistics and
U.S. Census Bureau, 2005). Recall error is curtailed because of the very short reference period,
and social desirability bias is unlikely because respondents are simply asked to report, in
chronological order, everything they did yesterday. Only after respondents report all their
activities does the interviewer ask whether any of them involved volunteering. As the ATUS
response rate has been only about 50 percent, however, the ATUS estimate of volunteering may
be subject to considerable nonresponse bias.
In this paper, we assess the nonresponse error in the ATUS estimate of volunteering.
This is possible because a random subsample of the ATUS was previously part of the Current

3

In fact, Keeter et al.’s (2000: 140) methodological experiment found significantly more volunteering in a survey
with a relatively low response rate than in a comparable survey with a much higher response rate. But in the context
of the large number of comparisons made in that study (the great majority of which showed no difference), sampling
error seemed a plausible explanation for the finding.

4

Population Survey (CPS) Volunteering Supplement, which attained a much higher response rate
than the ATUS (over 80 percent). We compare the CPS volunteering estimates for two groups
of Supplement respondents: those who became ATUS respondents and those who became ATUS
nonrespondents. We find a very large difference consistent with the hypothesis that ATUS
respondents are more likely than ATUS nonrespondents to be volunteers. In the CPS, ATUS
respondents reported volunteering at a rate 75 percent higher than did ATUS nonrespondents.
Furthermore, the nonresponse bias is evident within demographic and other subgroups, which
means that conventional statistical adjustments for nonresponse (e.g., weighting class
adjustments and response propensity models) would not correct the bias.
Our demonstration of the impact of nonresponse on volunteering estimates, coupled with
the finding that the bias is immune to conventional nonresponse adjustments, provides an
important qualification to the recent literature on the effects of nonresponse and has profound
implications for the study of volunteering, as well as, most likely, for the study of many other
pro-social behaviors, such as making charitable contributions, donating blood or organs, and
providing help to strangers in routine or emergency situations.
Although these analyses suggest that nonresponse plays a central role in inferences about
the amount of volunteering in the United States (as well as about changes over time in the
amount of volunteering), they are not informative about how nonresponse affects inferences
about the causes and consequences of volunteering. To that end, we next investigate the impact
of the nonresponse error on estimates of the correlates of volunteering activity. We do this by
comparing models of volunteering in the CPS estimated for ATUS respondents with models
estimated for ATUS respondents and nonrespondents combined. The results are very similar:
Although nonresponse has a powerful effect on the univariate distribution of volunteering, it
does not affect inferences about the respondent characteristics that are associated with
5

volunteering. The possibility that multivariate analyses are more immune to nonresponse than
univariate analysis has potentially far-reaching implications for surveys on a wide range of
topics.
Finally, supplementing these analyses, which are based on volunteering estimates from
the CPS, we examine the volunteering estimates from the ATUS itself. As expected, the ATUS
univariate estimate of volunteer hours is much higher than the overall CPS estimate and closer to
the CPS estimate using only cases that later became ATUS respondents. In addition, inferences
from the ATUS sample about the relation between volunteer hours and other respondent
characteristics are similar to those from the total CPS sample, again suggesting that nonresponse
bias -- despite its impact on the level of volunteering -- does not pose a serious problem for
inferences about the correlates of volunteering.
DATA
The data used in our analysis come from two sources: the September 2003 Current
Population Survey Volunteering Supplement, and the 2003 and 2004 American Time Use
Survey. The fact that the American Time Use Survey sample is drawn from persons in
households that responded to the Current Population Survey makes our analysis possible.
Current Population Survey (CPS) Volunteering Supplement
The Current Population Survey (CPS) is a monthly household survey sponsored by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The survey uses an
area probability sample of the 50 states and the District of Columbia yielding almost 60,000
households per month. In order to facilitate state-level estimates, smaller states are oversampled.
CPS households are contacted for interviews in four consecutive months (Months in Sample, or
MIS, 1-4); leave the sample for the next eight months; and then return for four additional months

6

(MIS 5-8, which occur exactly one year after MIS 1-4).4 The majority of the interviews in MIS1 and MIS-5 are conducted in person, with about 20 percent conducted by telephone; most of the
interviews in the other months are conducted by telephone, with about 15 percent conducted in
person. The response rate to the main interview averages more than 90 percent.
A volunteering supplement has been administered to CPS sample members each
September since 2002. The supplement is administered after the main interview, either in
English or in Spanish, and asks about all household members age 15 and older. In the September
2003 supplement, information was collected for 95,337 individuals. The overall response rate
(main interview response rate multiplied by supplement response rate) was 81 percent.
The first two questions in the 2003 supplement were:
Since September 1st of last year, have [you/NAME] done any volunteer
activities through or for an organization? IF NO: Sometimes people don’t
think of activities they do infrequently or activities they do for children’s
schools, or youth organizations as volunteer activities. Since September 1st
of last year, have [you/NAME] done any of these types of volunteer
activities?
Respondents who replied affirmatively were then asked for the number of organizations for
which volunteer work was done, and the numbers of weeks and hours per week worked for each
organization (or, if the respondent said the hours per week varied, the number of hours for the
year).
American Time Use Survey (ATUS)
The American Time Use Survey (ATUS), an annual survey begun in 2003, is also
conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The ATUS sample is
chosen randomly from households participating in the CPS. As noted above, households
4

The CPS tracks dwelling units, not individuals or households. Thus, as individuals move into or out of the
dwelling unit, they will move into and out of the CPS sample. For other details of the survey, see Bureau of Labor
Statistics and U.S. Census Bureau (2002).

7

selected for the CPS are in the sample for a total of eight months, consisting of four consecutive
calendar months (MIS 1-4) followed by the same four calendar months a year later (MIS 5-8). In
any given month, approximately one-eighth of the CPS sample is in its final month (MIS-8).
The ATUS sample is selected from households that successfully complete the MIS-8 main
interview (about 93 percent of the MIS-8 sample do so). One randomly chosen individual age 15
years or older from each selected household is designated for ATUS participation. The ATUS
sample is selected proportional to a state’s population (thereby offsetting the CPS oversampling
of residents of small states). In addition, households with an Hispanic or non-Hispanic black
householder, as well as households with children, are oversampled. We correct for the
oversampling by using selection weights in our analyses.
ATUS interviews are distributed across the weeks of the year, with random allocations to
reporting days: one-quarter Saturdays, one-quarter Sundays, and one-half spread equally across
the five weekdays. The interviews are administered by telephone, either in English or in
Spanish. The roughly 5 percent of the sample for whom no telephone number is available are
sent a letter asking them to call a toll free number on a specified day and offered a $40 incentive
for doing so. Respondents are asked to describe their primary activities, and how long each
lasted, from 4:00 a.m. the previous day until 4:00 a.m. the interview day. After the 24 hours are
accounted for, respondents are asked whether they did any “volunteer activities for or through an
organization” during the day and those who say “No,” are prompted with “Sometimes people
don’t think of activities they do for schools, or youth, or religious organizations as volunteer
activities.” Anyone answering affirmatively is then asked “Which of the activities you told me
about were volunteer activities?”
Attempts to contact individuals for the ATUS begin about two months after the
household’s final CPS interview and continue for up to eight successive weeks. To minimize the
8

lag between the September 2003 Volunteering Supplement responses and the ATUS response
outcome, we use only the random subsample of cases that were MIS 5-8 in September 2003 (i.e.,
those whose final CPS interview took place in September, October, November or December
2003). Some of these 2003 Volunteering Supplement respondents were selected for the 2003
ATUS and some for the 2004 ATUS.
Of the 95,337 individuals 15 or older for whom information was collected in the
September 2003 CPS Volunteering Supplement, there were 9,004 subsequently selected for the
ATUS who were MIS 5-8 in September 2003. The ATUS weighted response rate for these cases
was 57 percent.5 Accounting for the non-response to the CPS MIS-8 basic interview (as noted
above, about 93 percent of the sample completed that interview), the effective response rate for
the ATUS cases in our sample was about 53 percent. This is just slightly above the response
rates for the entire ATUS.6
The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides joint ATUS-CPS files that contain identifying
information from the ATUS and a battery of demographic and labor force participation items
from the CPS final interview (MIS-8).7 We merged these variables with the appropriate year’s
ATUS interview files (2003 or 2004) and then linked the resulting file to the September 2003
CPS supplement file.

5

Ignoring the unequal probabilities of selection (e.g., households with children were oversampled), yields an
unweighted response rate for these cases of 56 percent.
6

In 2003, a total of 20,720 ATUS interviews were completed, for a weighted response rate of 54 percent. Budget
cuts reduced the total number of interviews to 13,973 in 2004, for a weighted response rate of 53 percent.
Accounting for nonresponse to the MIS-8 CPS interviews, these figures imply effective response rates of about 50
percent. The slightly higher response rate in our subsample dovetails with those cases having completed the
September Volunteering Supplement, whereas other cases selected for the ATUS were either nonrespondents to the
Supplement or not in the September sample. On the calculation of response rates, see Abraham, Maitland and
Bianchi (2006). For other survey details see Bureau of Labor Statistics and U.S. Census Bureau (2005).
7

We compared these variables as measured in the final month in sample and in the month of the Volunteering
Supplement, and generally found little change. The one exception is labor force participation, which shows
movement mainly between adjacent categories of hours worked.

9

Although the results presented in this article are based on MIS 5-8 cases from the 2003
CPS Volunteering Supplement that became part of the 2003 or 2004 American Time Use
Survey, we also conducted an analysis of MIS 5-8 cases from the 2002 CPS Volunteering
Supplement that became part of the 2003 ATUS. That analysis yielded conclusions that are
identical to those we present here.
METHODS
Our analysis begins with September 2003 CPS Supplement univariate and bivariate
distributions of volunteer activity for individuals later selected for the ATUS. These analyses are
augmented by multivariate models of the decision to volunteer and of the choice regarding how
many hours to volunteer. If the same factors determine the two decisions, a Tobit specification
might be appropriate for explaining both outcomes (Tobin 1958). Formally, the Tobit model can
be written:
yi* = xiβ + ui, i = 1, 2, …, n
(1)

yi = yi* if yi* > α
yi = 0 if yi* ≤ α

where yi* is a latent variable that is observable only when its value lies above a censoring
threshold, yi is the observed variable, xi is a vector of explanatory factors, β is a vector of
coefficients, α is the censoring threshold, and ui is a residual that is assumed to be independent
and identically distributed (i.i.d.) from a normal distribution with mean zero and variance σ2. In
our case, yi* would be the latent propensity to volunteer, with actual volunteer hours yi equal to
yi* when yi* > 0 and equal to 0 otherwise. Although the Tobit specification has some appeal, a

10

formal test strongly rejected its assumption that a single set of parameters can explain both the
decision to volunteer and the number of hours volunteered.8
A more flexible alternative specification is a two-part model of the sort proposed by
Cragg (1971). In the two-part model, a logit or probit equation is used to model whether or not a
behavior of interest occurs, and a separate regression equation is used to model the intensity of
the behavior for those who engage in it. Two-part models have been used, among other
applications, to study spending on consumer durables (Cragg, 1971), vacation spending
(Melenberg and Van Soest, 1996), and the demand for cigarettes (Raptou et al., 2005), and
frequently are employed by health economists interested in explaining health care outcomes and
medical care spending (see, for example, Duan et al 1983). All of these applications have in
common that different factors are believed to determine an outcome’s incidence (positive versus
zero) as opposed to its intensity (the positive values’ magnitude). In our analysis, we use a
probit equation to model whether or not a person reports any volunteer activity, and an ordinary
least squares regression to model hours of volunteer activity for those who report volunteering.
Noting that:
(2)

E(y X ) = P(y > 0 X ) x E(y y > 0, X)

the effect of the change in any explanatory variable on average volunteer hours can be written as:
(3)

δ E ( y y > 0)
δ E( y)
δ P( y > 0)
=
x E ( y y > 0, X ) + P(y > 0 X ) x
δ Xc
δ Xc
δ Xc

In this equation, the first term on the right-hand side represents the effect on overall average
volunteer hours due to the change in the probability of volunteering and the second term
represents the effect due to the change in average volunteer hours among those who volunteer.

See Greene (2003: 770), for details concerning the test of the Tobit model restrictions.

Unless otherwise stated, all the estimates we report in this paper were calculated using
ATUS selection (i.e., base) weights.9 Standard errors were calculated using a replicate variance
method proposed by Fay (1989) that accounts for the increase in variance associated with the
clustering and weighting in the ATUS sample relative to the variance that would be expected in a
simple random sample of the same size. The replicate weights we used to implement this
procedure were provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The DESCRIPT procedure in SAScallable SUDAAN was used to compute the standard errors reported in Tables 1, 2 and 4, and
also to carry out tests of statistical significance for differences in estimates across subgroups.
Stata software (SVY) was used to estimate the multivariate models and associated standard
errors reported in Table 3.
RESULTS
CPS Univariate Estimates of Volunteering
We begin by comparing the volunteering reports from the entire CPS supplement sample
to those from our overlap subsample (which, two to eight months later, became ATUS
respondents or nonrespondents). Comparing the first two rows of Table 1, we see that the
estimates from the overlap sample are very close to those from the full sample. About 29 percent
of each group reported having volunteered in the past year, and the average volunteer time
reported by the two groups was very similar (37.9 hours versus 37.4 hours). The estimate of
mean hours among those who did any volunteering also is very similar for the two groups (131.4
in the overlap subsample versus 129.8 hours in the full sample). In each case, the estimated
value for our overlap sample is statistically indistinguishable from that for the CPS Supplement
respondents who were not selected for the ATUS.
9

Since our aim is to assess nonresponse bias, we chose not to use the ATUS final weights that incorporate poststratification, which is intended to adjust for nonresponse. In fact, as already noted, our findings imply that poststratification will not correct for the nonresponse bias in the volunteering estimates.

12

TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE
The third and fourth rows of Table 1 show that individuals who became ATUS
respondents were over 75 percent more likely than those who became ATUS nonrespondents to
report in the CPS that they had done volunteer work: 36 percent versus 20 percent. Likewise
ATUS respondents reported an average of over 75 percent more hours worked as a volunteer
than did ATUS nonrespondents: 46.6 hours versus 26.4 hours. The second finding is entirely a
function of the first – among those who said they had volunteered, there is no difference between
respondents and nonrespondents in the average number of volunteer hours.10
The remaining rows of Table 1 disaggregate the nonrespondents into five subgroups: two
for which telephone contact was not undertaken (because the respondent had moved away or no
valid phone number for the household was available); one that was not successfully contacted
(despite good contact information); one that refused; and a residual group, which consisted
largely of individuals who spoke neither English nor Spanish. All five groups had much lower
rates of volunteering than did respondents, but there were differences among the groups.
ATUS contacts are not attempted with individuals who no longer live at the address at
which the CPS interview was conducted nor were in-person interviews attempted for those
individuals for whom good telephone contact information was lacking. These two groups show
lower rates of volunteering than do unsuccessful contacts and refusals, and the volunteering rates
of the “other” (mainly language barrier) group are even lower. We interpret these results in
terms of social integration: Geographical mobility, lacking phone service, and speaking neither
English nor Spanish are all indicators of weak social integration. The differences between the

10

Interviewers were instructed to try to conduct CPS Supplement interviews with each household member, but
proxy reports were accepted where that was not feasible. As a check on whether proxy reports affected our results,
we redid the analyses including only single person households, in which proxy reports are not possible. As with the
full sample, we find that respondents are about 15 percentage points more likely to volunteer than nonrespondents
and that, as a result, they have higher average volunteer hours.

13

two remaining groups, refusals and unsuccessful contacts, are not statistically significant.
Though both show significantly higher rates of volunteering than other nonrespondents, their
volunteering rates are still much lower than those of respondents.11
CPS Bivariate Estimates of Volunteering
The conventional approach to dealing with nonresponse bias is some form of statistical
adjustment based on weighting classes, propensity models or a related technique. As noted by
Groves (2006: 653), however, “All of these adjustment techniques require assumptions that
groups of respondents and nonrespondents share response propensities and distributional
properties on survey measures.” To the extent that respondents and nonrespondents within a
weighting class do not share the same expected values on the survey variable, the adjustment will
fail. Unlike the typical situation in which this assumption is untestable, we can examine whether
the CPS volunteering reports of ATUS respondents and nonrespondents are the same within
subclasses of background variables that have been shown to be related to volunteering.
Wilson and Musick (1997; see also Musick, Wilson, and Bynum, 2000) argue that
volunteering is a function of three kinds of resources: human capital, social capital and cultural
capital. The CPS has no measures of cultural resources, but it does contain indicators of both
human capital and social capital, as well as other background characteristics. Our principal
measure of human capital is educational attainment, which we supplement with household
income as a rough proxy for unobserved skills that may affect earnings power. The CPS
contains six measures that we use as indicators of social capital: being in the labor force, being
married, living in a household with children, living in a household that includes no adults other

11

The differences among the five nonrespondent groups in hours volunteered parallel the differences in volunteering
rates, though because the standard errors of these estimates are relatively larger the differences are generally not
statistically significant. Among those who claimed to have volunteered, the differences in average hours between
respondents and each of the nonrespondent groups is statistically insignificant (with the exception of the “other”
group).

than immediate family members, living in a home that is owned rather than rented, and living in
a household with a telephone. Finally, we account for five background characteristics: sex, age,
race/ethnicity, urbanicity and region of residence. Taken together, these constitute a potentially
rich set of variables for nonresponse adjustment.
TABLE 2a ABOUT HERE
The second column in Table 2a shows that human capital, social capital, and other
background variables are related to rates of volunteering in the expected ways. For example,
individuals with more education are more likely to report volunteering, as are those with higher
incomes, married people, those with school-age children, homeowners, women, and nonHispanic non-blacks.
The more important result in Table 2a is that, within every subgroup, respondents report
higher volunteering rates than nonrespondents. There is some variation in the size of the
difference (e.g., the difference is larger for older respondents than for younger ones), but the
most striking aspect of the table is the extent to which nonrespondents are distinctive. In 51 of
the 52 subgroups, the volunteering rate among respondents is at least 25 percent greater than
among nonrespondents (and in 49 cases it is at least 40 percent higher). This is compelling
evidence against the assumption that respondents and nonrespondents within subclasses share the
same expected values on volunteering.
Table 2b presents the same analysis, substituting overall average volunteer hours for
volunteer rates. The second column generally shows the expected associations between hours
and the independent variables. Individuals who are better educated and those who have higher
incomes report more volunteer hours, as do married people, homeowners, women, and nonHispanic non-blacks. More importantly, in 50 of the 52 subgroups, respondents report higher
levels of mean volunteer hours than do nonrespondents, and the difference in reported hours
15

between respondents and nonrespondents is not statistically significant in the two cases where
the reverse is true.
TABLE 2b ABOUT HERE
The fact that the volunteering difference between respondents and nonrespondents is
similarly large within subgroups is bad news for univariate analyses, because it means that
statistical adjustment for nonresponse based on observable demographic or other background
characteristics of the sample members will not correct the bias in the estimate of the overall
amount of volunteering in the population. But it is good news for bivariate (and possibly,
multivariate) analysis. If the nonresponse bias is approximately constant across subgroups,
inferences about the relationships between volunteering and the variables used to define the
subgroups will be relatively unaffected. That is, although the level of volunteering will be
exaggerated, it will be exaggerated to about the same extent across subgroups, and thus estimates
of the differences between subgroups will be little affected.
Although comparing the second and fourth columns in Tables 2a and 2b indicates that the
bivariate associations are generally immune to nonresponse bias, given the interrelationships
among the variables we would like to know whether the same can be said about multivariate
analyses.
CPS Multivariate Estimates of Volunteering
In this section, we estimate multivariate models of volunteering using the human capital,
social capital, and other demographic indicators, first for the full ATUS overlap sample and then
for the subsample of ATUS respondents. Adding a dummy variable distinguishing ATUS
respondents and nonrespondents to the full sample model allows us to test whether nonresponse
has a significant impact on estimates after simultaneously controlling for all the other
characteristics. Comparison of the full sample and ATUS respondent models allows us to test
16

whether inferences about the factors that affect volunteering are robust to nonresponse. To the
extent that coefficients in the model including only respondents differ from those in the model
based on the full sample, nonresponse bias affects multivariate inference. To the extent that
coefficients in the model are not altered as we move from the full sample to the respondents-only
sample, multivariate inferences are not compromised by nonresponse bias.
The first three columns in Table 3 summarize the results of using the full sample to
estimate a two-part multivariate volunteering model. The first column of the table, from a probit
analysis of the propensity to volunteer, shows the percentage point change in the volunteering
rate associated with having the particular indicated characteristic rather than the full base set of
characteristics.12 The coefficients in the second column, from an ordinary least squares
regression, show the effects of the same characteristics on annual volunteer hours among those
who volunteer. Drawing on equation (3), the two sets of coefficients can be used in conjunction
with the estimates of the volunteer rate [P(y>0 | X)] and of volunteer hours among those who
volunteer [E(y | y>0, X)] to estimate the effects of each variable on overall average volunteer
hours (for a person with the base group characteristics). These estimates are shown in the third
column of Table 3.
TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE
As can be seen in the first column of Table 3, most of the explanatory variables are
significantly related to the propensity to volunteer. The differences among groups generally
parallel those observed in the bivariate results (Table 2a), but tend to be smaller (as would be
expected given the intercorrelations among the independent variables). The main exception
involves the association between marital status and the propensity to volunteer: The higher
12

The reference person is defined by the modal category of each characteristic. She is a married female nonHispanic non-black high school graduate age 31-45 who lives in the south and owns a home in the suburbs that has
telephone service. She is not in the labor force and has an annual household income in the range $20,000-$39,999.
She has no children or non-immediate family members resident in the household.

17

volunteering rate among married respondents shown in Table 2a reflects these individuals’ other
characteristics rather than their marital status.
In contrast, the multivariate model reveals that only a few characteristics are significantly
related to volunteer hours among those who volunteered (second column of Table 3). Among
volunteers, those who had not graduated from high school and those without telephone service
reported fewer hours, and those older than 65 reported more hours. In addition, compared to
volunteers not in the labor force, those who worked less than 45 hours per week reported fewer
hours. (The remaining statistically significant effect, for cases whose urbanicity was missing, is
based on only 6 respondents.)
These results are not comparable to the bivariate results in Table 2b since they are based
only on respondents who volunteered, whereas Tables 2b includes all respondents. The
estimates in the third column of Table 3, which show the effects on overall volunteer hours, can
be compared to the bivariate estimates reported in Table 2b. The two sets of results are generally
similar, with education, income, presence of school-age children, and not having a telephone in
the household associated with sizeable differences in volunteer hours. Except for the difference
associated with household telephone status, these large differences in average volunteer hours
are due primarily to differences in volunteer rates rather than hours worked among those who
volunteer (the difference by household telephone status reflects both of these effects).
By adding a dummy variable for whether a person is an ATUS respondent to the
volunteer rate and volunteer hours equations reported in the first two columns of Table 3, we can
measure the degree to which ATUS respondents differ from ATUS nonrespondents in their
reported volunteer behavior once all the background characteristics are held constant. The
coefficient on the respondent dummy variable in the volunteer propensity equation is highly
significant and indicates that, among those with the reference set of personal characteristics,
18

respondents are 10 percentage points more likely to volunteer than nonrespondents. This effect
is two-thirds the size of the 15 percentage point differential in volunteering propensities
documented in Table 1 without accounting for differences in the observable characteristics of
respondents and nonrespondents. As was true absent controls for other characteristics,
conditional on volunteering, the hours reported by respondents do not differ significantly from
those reported by nonrespondents. Taken together, the two sets of coefficient estimates imply
that, all else the same, respondents volunteer annually an average of about 13 hours more than
nonrespondents.13
By comparing the results in the last three columns of Table 3 with those in the first three
columns, we can assess the extent to which using data for respondents alone affects the
multivariate associations between volunteering and the background characteristics. Consistent
with the message of Tables 2a and 2b, the exclusion of the nonrespondents has little impact on
multivariate inferences. The coefficients in the “respondent” models generally are very similar
to those in the “full sample” models. As a more formal test, we compared models estimated for
the full sample that contained all of the background characteristics plus a dummy variable for
whether the person was an ATUS respondent to a series of models that added interactions
between the ATUS respondent dummy and selected background variables. The first of these
alternate models added interactions between the respondent dummy and the four education
dummies, the second added interactions with the four household income dummies, and so on.
For eight of the sets of background variables (labor force status, marital status, children in the
household, others in the household, telephone service, sex, urbanicity and region) the interaction
terms were not statistically significant, and in none of the five cases in which they were
13

Adding the ATUS response dummy variable to these equations has little effect on the coefficients estimated for
the other characteristic variables. Full results are available upon request.

19

statistically significant (education, income, housing tenure, race and age) do the qualitative
inferences to be drawn about the relationship between volunteering and the background
characteristic differ between the full versus respondent samples.
ATUS Estimates of Volunteering
To this point we have reported volunteering estimates from the CPS. Among those in the
overlap sample who said in the CPS that they had volunteered, 70 percent became ATUS
respondents compared to just 52 percent of those who said they had not volunteered. Our
expectation is that this differential nonresponse will (a) cause the ATUS volunteering estimates
to be too high, but (b) will not affect the ATUS estimates of volunteering’s correlates.
Unlike the CPS (which has a twelve-month reporting period), the single day reporting
period of the ATUS means that the ATUS cannot produce a meaningful estimate of the
proportion of volunteers. The ATUS can, however, produce a meaningful estimate of mean
annual volunteer hours that we can compare to the CPS hours estimate. For this estimate we use
the entire ATUS sample, not just those sample members who had previously participated in the
September 2003 Volunteering Supplement. The first step in constructing the ATUS estimate of
mean annual hours is to calculate the weighted mean of the hours reported by survey respondents
on their diary day, using the ATUS sample (base) weights adjusted to account for the differing
probabilities of assignment to weekday versus weekend days. Multiplying this estimate of mean
daily volunteer hours by 365 yields an estimate of mean annual volunteer hours. We compare
estimates from the CPS supplement that refer to the September 2002-September 2003 period to
ATUS estimates for calendar year 2003.14

14

Though the two estimates cover slightly different time periods, both cover a full calendar year and, given that the
2004 CPS volunteering supplement produced results almost identical to those from the 2003 supplement, we have
no reason to believe that the discrepancy between the starting dates for the two reference periods should have
significantly affected the findings.

20

As noted earlier, the CPS estimate of average volunteer hours for the period September
2002 to September 2003 is 37.4 hours for the full ATUS overlap sample and 46.6 hours for the
ATUS respondents among that group (Table 1). If there were no other differences between the
surveys, we might therefore expect the estimate for the calendar year 2003 ATUS sample to be
within sampling error of 46.6 hours. In fact, the ATUS estimate of mean volunteer hours for
calendar year 2003 is slightly higher, at 53.5 hours with a standard error of 2.2 hours (Table 4). 15
Although the ATUS estimate of volunteer hours suffers from substantial nonresponse bias that
makes it much too high, the CPS estimate might suffer from recall error due to the difficulty of
the twelve-month recall task (leading to a downward bias) and from social desirability bias
(leading to an upward bias). Since the ATUS is not apt to suffer significantly from either of
these two error sources, the fact that the ATUS estimate is a little higher than the CPS estimate
based on ATUS respondents suggests that recall error is a somewhat larger problem for the CPS
estimates than social desirability bias.16
TABLE 4 ABOUT HERE

15

We can also compare the 2003 CPS estimate for ATUS respondents (46.6 hours with a standard error of 2.6
hours) to the ATUS estimate for the same respondents (58.2 hours with a standard error of 4.5 hours), but this
comparison is more severely compromised by different reference periods. All of the interviews with ATUS
respondents who completed the CPS supplement occurred between November 2003 and May 2004, with most
completed between December 2003 and March 2004. To the extent that volunteering is seasonal, ATUS estimates
based on interviews conducted during the December through March period may differ from estimates based on
interviews conducted across the whole calendar year. Further, this comparison does not benefit from overlap
between the CPS and ATUS reference periods.

16

The ATUS and the CPS also differ in that about 5 percent of ATUS respondents were paid a $40 incentive to
participate (compared to no respondents being paid in the CPS) and all the ATUS interviews were conducted by
telephone whereas about 30 percent of the CPS interviews were conducted in person. Although ATUS respondents
who received incentives to participate reported less volunteer activity than other respondents, excluding them from
the analysis changes none of our conclusions. To assess the effect of telephone versus in person administration on
reports of volunteer activity, we compared estimates based on the full CPS supplement sample for respondents in
MIS-1 and MIS-5, most of whom were interviewed in person, with estimates for respondents in MIS 2-4 and MIS 68, most of whom were interviewed by phone. MIS-1 and MIS-5 respondents were a little more likely to report
volunteering than other respondents (32.1 percent versus 30.0 percent and 43.7 hours versus 38.2 hours) but this
difference may reflect a month-in-sample effect rather than a mode effect.

21

Table 4 also shows that, although the ATUS estimate of average volunteer hours is much
larger than that from the full CPS sample, the ATUS estimates of the associations between
respondent background characteristics and volunteer hours are similar to those from the CPS
(Table 2b). Thus at least in this case conclusions about the determinants of volunteering are
generally unaffected by nonresponse.17
DISCUSSION
The large variation in survey estimates of volunteering (including those from the CPS
volunteering supplement) might plausibly be attributed to measurement error – the difficulty
respondents have recalling an entire year’s activities and respondent exaggeration in reporting
the extent of their volunteering. These concerns about the quality of responses to volunteering
questions led scholars eagerly to await the American Time Use Survey, which provides
volunteering estimates that are unlikely to suffer from major recall error or motivated
misreporting. With this in mind, Abraham and Mackie (2005: 147) wrote that “When they
become available, data on volunteer activity from the new American Time Use Survey (ATUS)
should be more reliable than any that currently exist.” Our results, however, indicate that
although the ATUS estimates may be less susceptible to measurement error than the CPS
volunteering supplement estimates, this is outweighed by the much greater nonresponse error in
the ATUS estimates.
We believe our finding of nonresponse bias in the ATUS sample has implications for all
surveys of volunteering. In our introduction, for instance, we noted the discrepancy in
volunteering rates between the 1996 National Household Education Survey (NHES; National

17

Our inferences about the impact of ATUS nonresponse are based on the characteristics of those ATUS
nonrespondents (about four-fifths) for whom we have CPS Volunteering Supplement observations. The remaining
ATUS nonresponse overlaps with nonresponse to the CPS Supplement. It seems very likely that the latter
nonrespondents (for whom we have no data) are also disproportionately nonvolunteers, but to the extent this is
incorrect it could compromise our conclusions.

22

Center for Education Statistics, 1997) and the 2002 CPS Supplement (Boraas, 2003). The higher
volunteering rate in the 1996 NHES (39 percent) as compared to the 2002 CPS supplement (28
percent) is entirely consistent with the two surveys’ relative response rates (59 percent versus 81
percent).
Similarly, the volunteering rate of 55 percent from Grimm et al.’s (2005) survey of
teenagers is likely a function of that survey’s relatively low response rate (44 percent). Thus
Grimm et al.’s conclusion that teenagers volunteer at a rate “more than one and a half times the
adult rate of 29 percent as established by the…2004 Current Population Survey figures, which
used the same questions and definitions as the Youth Volunteering Survey” is almost surely
wrong. The difference is most likely a function of nonresponse bias – that is, of teenagers who
were not volunteers being much less likely to participate (the CPS shows that teenagers are less
apt to volunteer than are middle-aged adults).18
If we are correct that our results are due to the strong connection between the causes of
volunteering and the causes of survey participation, then surveys also will tend to overestimate
other prosocial activities. Three prior studies provide evidence along these lines. Couper,
Singer, and Kulka (1998) found that households in which respondents said they participated in
community activities were more likely to have returned their decennial census form than
households in which respondents said they did not participate in such activities. Groves, Singer,
and Corning (2000) reported that the response rate to a mail survey was higher among those who
had scored high on an index of community involvement in an earlier survey than among those
who had scored low (but only for the half sample that did not receive a $5 prepaid incentive).
18

Parental permission is required for the Youth Volunteering Survey, and according to one of the Grimm et al.,
coauthors, parental refusals are the survey’s main source of nonresponse (N. Dietz, personal communication).
Although a growing number of high schools require students to meet “volunteer” service hours requirements in
order to graduate, fewer than a quarter of high school students were subject to such a requirement in 1999, the most
recent year for which we have been able to locate this information (Kleiner and Chapman, 1999).

23

And Kennickell (2005) found that individuals who declared larger charitable contribution
deductions on their federal income tax return were more likely to be respondents in the Survey of
Consumer Finances than those who declared smaller deductions. Although these studies
generally focused on the effect of a prosocial behavior on nonresponse, without addressing the
corresponding issue of nonresponse’s impact on estimates of the prosocial behavior, they all
suggest that nonresponse will lead to overestimating such behaviors.19
To the extent that the size of the nonresponse bias in volunteering (and other prosocial
activities) is affected by the level of nonresponse, the secular decline in response rates means that
inferences about changes over time in volunteering (and prosocial behaviors more generally) are
apt to be distorted by the bias. Estimates of volunteering likely have increased over time (see
Figure 1) because the composition of samples changed as response rates declined. This seems to
be the most compelling explanation for why trends in volunteering over the last several decades
are so different from trends in other dimensions of social capital (Putnam 2000: 127).
Researchers commonly rely on weights to correct for differential nonresponse across
different groups of sample members. Such weighting will ameliorate nonresponse bias only to
the extent that the characteristics used to make the weighting adjustments are correlated both
with the propensity to respond and with the variables of interest. Because there are significant
differences in volunteering between respondents and nonrespondents even after controlling for a
rich set of demographic characteristics, standard weighting adjustments cannot be relied upon to
fix the problem with estimates of volunteering. This is apt also to be the case for other prosocial
behaviors.

19

Although the evidence is more indirect, Robinson (1989) suggests that surveys are also apt to overestimate
participation in the arts because those who engage in such activities are more likely to participate in surveys than
those who don’t engage in the arts.

24

The importance of volunteering as a determinant of response propensity, however,
suggests a strategy to improve weighting adjustments in other survey contexts. Specifically, our
findings suggest that there is an important element of altruism in the decision about whether to
respond to a survey request. If the two basic CPS questions about volunteering were routinely
added to household surveys, that information could be used together with information from the
CPS volunteering supplements to create weighting adjustment factors that account for the share
of volunteers in the survey sample relative to the population share. The inclusion of volunteering
as a determinant of response propensity in the nonresponse weighting process should be
particularly helpful for improving estimates of other prosocial behaviors that one would expect
to be strongly correlated with volunteering, but also would improve the estimate of any variable
correlated with volunteering.
Although our findings have troubling implications for research on the amount of
volunteering, on trends in volunteering over time, and on the usefulness of conventional
statistical adjustments based on the demographic characteristics of respondents to correct the
problems, the implications are more comforting for research on the characteristics of individuals
associated with volunteering. Our results suggest that bivariate and multivariate inferences about
the relationship of volunteering (and likely other prosocial activities) to respondent
characteristics are relatively immune to nonresponse bias. In this sense, the results resemble the
pattern of “form-resistant correlations,” the tendency for changes in survey question wording that
affect univariate distributions not to affect bivariate or multivariate distributions (Schuman and
Presser, 1981). The findings presented here suggest the same may be true of nonresponse.
Studies with measures other than volunteering are needed to determine the extent to which this
applies to survey estimates in general.

Note: The volunteer propensity equation is a probit model. The numbers reported in the first and fourth columns are
estimates of change in the volunteering rate implied by the probit coefficients. The volunteer hours equations in the second
and fifth columns are least squares regressions estimated for those with positive volunteer hours. Estimated effects on
overall hours appear in the third and sixth columns. All estimates are weighted using the ATUS sample weights. Standard
errors reported in parentheses have been adjusted to account for the clustering and weighting of the sample.
