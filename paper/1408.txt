The Pricing of Default—Free Mortgages

ABSTRACT

In this paper

we examine the household's option to prepay or call

standard fixed—rate mortgage.

a

Results based on simulation indicate that the

value of this option is sensitive to the expected path of interest rates, the
variation around that path, risk aversion and refinancing costs.
Unfortunately, efforts to estimate the interest rate process (by us and by
previous authors) have met with only limited success, and uncertainty exists
regarding the degree of risk aversion and the magnitude of refinancing costs.
Thus we conclude that the application of contingent—claims methodology to
options on bonds is conceptually more difficult and operationally less reliable
than is the analogous application to options on stocks.
Despite these reservations concerning the use of our model as a technique
for absolute valuation, preliminary findings on the effects of changes in

mortgage contract design on the value of the prepayment option are encouraging.
For example, our estimate of the relative values of the call options on 30— and
15—year mortgages and on level—payment and graduated—payment mortgages appear

to be reasonably robust with respect to specifications of the interest rate
process and the other parameters.

These findings suggest that our model may be

of considerable use within the context of relative or comparative valuation.

The Pricing of Default—Free Mortgages

Stephen A. Buser and Patric H. Hendershott

A number of recent studies have attempted to price the prepayment or
call option in mortgage contracts (Dunn and Mcconnell, 1981a and b) or
limitations on this option (Dietrich et. ad.,

1983).

These studies:

(1)

assume that the spot rate of interest follows a mean—reverting process with a
constant—elasticity standard deviation,

(2) assign parameter values to the

mean—reverting spot rate, the elasticity and scale of the standard deviation,
the speed of adjustment and the "market price of risk",

(3) assume zero tax

rates and (4) calculate prices for the call option or limitations upon it!

These studies suggest considerable confidence in the magnitudes of most,
if not all, of the key parameters.

Dunn and Mcconnell (1981b, p. 606) report

that the parameter values used in their simulations were "similar to those
estimated by Ingersoll" in an unpublished paper (1976) and did not report
sensitivity results.

The absence of such results could be taken as an

indication that their model was sufficiently robust to permit reasonable
inferences from the selected simulation results tabulated and reported.

Dietrich, et. a1, too, specify values with no discussion.
Unfortunately, there is substantial disagreement regarding many of these
parameter values, as a comparison of the assumptions underlying Dunn—Mcconnell
and Dietrich et. al. makes clear, and the results of these analyses are quite
sensitive to a number of parameter values,

consideration of the speed at

one were uncertain regarding the time path of one of these parameters
(interest rate volatility or the market price of risk, for example) but
fairly certain of the others, and were willing to posit market efficiency,
then one could extract a time series on the unknown variable from observed
mortgage price data.
Bodie and Friedman (1978) did, in fact, extract an
interest—rate volatility series from bond price and yield data.
,

which the interest rate adjusts to its mean—reverting value illustrates the
point.

Dietrich, et. al. posit a speed of 03, whereas Dunn and Mcconnell

employ 0.8.

With the lower 0.3 adjustment speed, Dunn and Mcconnell's

estimates of the value of call would have doubled.

Similarly, small changes

in risk aversion (in the assumed rate on infinite—maturity default—free debt
relative to the mean—reverting value of the spot rate) have significant
impacts on the value of call.

We beqin this paper with a description of arbitrage—free pricing.

In

Section II, we take a closer look at establishing 'reasonable" parameter
values.

This includes estimation of the interest—rate process and

consideration of the existinq literature.

Section III contains a detailed

analysis of the value of the call option in GNMA pools of level—payment
mortgaqes.

Sensitivity analysis is conducted both with Dunn and Mcconnell

In Section IV, we turn to an analysis of GNMAs

based upon pools of 15—year fixed—rate and 30—year graduated—payment

To simplify the notation, we suppress

the functional form for these values as we do for the spot rate of interest,
i.e., we use f for f(t, r), g for g(t, r) and r for r(t).
Given these technical assumptions, we can apply Ito's lemma (see McKean
(1968)J which identifies an essential closure property that smooth functions
(such as 1) of Ito processes (such as 2)

are themselves Ito processes.

Thus

incorporated via simple adjustments to the mean of instantaneous bond returns.

measure the sensitivity of the model to this extension.

where: C is the instantaneous cash payment (coupon plus amortization) on the
mortgage;

the mortgage; and X,

"the market price of risk," is a deterministic function

of time and the spot rate of interest.

The first term is the price drift including prepayment but abstracting from
interest—rate changes, and the second term is due to the risk—adjusted
interest—rate drift (as is the third which reflects the 'Ito effect')

The

remaining terms compare the cash flows of the mortgage with those of an
alternative "pure cash' investment.

CES Processes

Most of the applied work on arbitrage—free interest—dependent claims has
focused on the special case of a spot rate of interest that follows a mean—
reverting process with a constant—elasticity standard deviation, hereafter
referred to as a CES process.

a rule, researchers rely on numerical alternatives such as the implicit
difference method described by Brennan and Schwartz (1977)

Thus our computer

program solves a second—order difference equation subject to boundary
conditions. As a check on our numerical and programming procedures, we have
reproduced simulation results reported previously by Dunn and Mcconnell
(l98la

latter

should not be surprising.

Shiller et al (1983) have reported results

indicating that future expected spot rates have zero ability to explain
changes in spot rates.

In effect, changes in spot rates are predominantly

unexpected, and the impact of unexpected events swamps the impact of expected
changes.

This does not mean, however, that expected future rate changes would

not govern actual changes in the absence of unexpected events.

In fact,

Hendershott (1984) has shown that changes in the six—month bill rate are
related to the expected change implied by forward rates when surprise
variables (unexpected changes in anticipated inflation, industrial production
and base money) are included in the estimation equation.
Say that these surprises show up in both p and r, which would likely be
the case when p is proxied by the 20—year Treasury rate.

period.

Each of the parts of Tables 4—6 contains three calculations for each of
three values of the parameter for which sensitivity is being tested, and the
results are reported for five values of the spot rate.

The three calculated

values are: the price of the $100 par value mortgage, the value of the call
option in dollars (price of a noncallable mortgage with the same coupon less
the price of the callable mortgage)

and the value of the call option in basis

points (the stated coupon less the calculated coupon on a noncallãble mortgage
that would have the same price as the callable mortgage)

To illustrate, when

the spot rate is 0.059 in Table 4 and the parameters are set at the Dunn—
Mcconnell base case values, the price of the mortgage is $99.58, the call is
worth $3.69 (the price of a noncallable mortgage would be $103.27) or a 29
basis point higher coupon (a noncallable mortgage priced at $99.58 would carry
a 7.71 percent coupon)

Before turning to the specific results, it is probably useful to
indicate roughly how the variables should affect the call premium.

The three numbers for each çctarneter value at each spot rate are; the price for a $100 par value mortgtge, the
difference between the price on the same coupon noncallable mortgage arid the price on the callable mortgage, and
the price difference translated into a coupon rate (basis points) equivalent.

Because the refinancing wedge and the infinite—maturity yield enter only one
relation, their directional impacts on the call premium are necessarily
unambiguous.

The greater the refinancing wedge, the less the chance of call

and thus the lower the premium.

The impact of R(oo), and the role of the price

of risk generally, requires more explanation.

The call provision of a

mortgage limits the extraordinarily large one—period gains received when
interest rates decline (the mortgage is called) but also dampens losses when
interest rates rise (the call premium is earned)

.

Thus callable debt is less

risky (has a lower standard deviation around the expected return) than
noncallable debt.

An increase in the price of risk increases yields on risky

securities (noncallable) relative to less risky securities
call premia decline.

(callable) .

Hence

Increasing R() in the simulations is simply a means of

analyzing a pure increase in risk aversion.

The result will thus be a

decrease in the call premium.

A higher mean—reverting value () lowers the chance of call and thus
tends to decrease the call premium.

On the other hand, a higher p, other

things being equal, means the price of risk has declined, a decline which
tends to raise the call premium.
in p is not readily apparent.

Thus the directional impact of an increase

A higher speed of adjustment (k) restricts

declines in interest rates that tend to trigger call.
the lower is the call premium.6

Thus the higher is k,

Finally, an increase in the variance (a) of

rates generally increases the likelihood of call and thus raises the call

6An exception can occur when the spot rate starts at such a high value

relative to the mean—reverting value that much expected downward pull is
necessary in order for an unexpected decline in rates to have any chance to
trigger call.
(The change in risk—aversion implied by a change in k is
uncertain in direction and likely quite small in magnitude.)

premium.7

(While an increase also implies an increase in the price of risk,

the increase is slight and thus we would expect the direct effect to
dominate.)

Dunn—Mcconnell 8% Coupon
Consider the base case, which is reported in the center section of all
parts of Table 4 as a basis of comparison.

At a spot rate equal to the mean—

reverting value of 0.056, the call is worth about 30 basis points.

At lower

spot rates, instantaneous call occurs5 at a roughly doubled spot rate, the
call is worth about 20 basis points.

These values seem low because the spread

between GNMAs and a portfolio of Treasuries having an identical expected
pattern of cash flows, taking into account differences in timing of payments,
averaged about 65 basis points during the 1977—78 period when interest rates
were in this range [Hendershott, Shilling and Villani, 1984].
The value of the call is quite sensitive to some of the parameters.
Most important are the yield on infinite—maturity default—free debt and the
interest—rate speed of adjustment.

A half percentage point reduction in the

former, which constitutes a significant reduction in assumed risk aversion,
roughly doubles the call premium (and triggers call at spot rates below 6
percent) .

So also does a reduction in the interest—rate speed of adjustment

from 0.8 to 0.2 which sharply reduces the pull of the mean—reverting value on
diverging spot rates.

The high assumed values of either the infinite—maturity

debt rate or the speed of adiustment could explain the low estimated call
premium relative to that observed in the market place.

exception can occur when the spot rate starts at such a low value relative
to the mean—reverting value that call is likely unless there is a large
unexpected increase in interest rates.

—19—

Changes in the scale parameter work in the opposite direction.
the scale from 0.9 to 0.5 roughly halves the call premium.
other parameters have even smaller impacts.

Cutting

Changes in the

Addition of a 2 point wedge to

deter refinancing cuts the premium by about a third, while raising the mean—
reverting value by a full percentage point decreases the call premium by only
10 to 25 percent, depending on the level of the spot rate.
sensitivity

The lesser

of the call premium to the variance scale parameter than to

numerous other parameters, which could easily be changing over time, suggests
great, difficulty in extracting variance estimates from market data a' la
Bodie and Friedman (1978)

The Revised 8% Coupon
The base case result, reported in all parts of Table 5, indicates a call
value of 100 basis points at a spot rate of 0.056.
under the Dunn and Mcconnell assumptions.

This is triple the value

With a spot rate of 6 percent, the

call is worth about 70 basis points, and a 50 percent higher spot lowers the
call value to under 10 basis points.

In general, the call estimates are sensitive to the same parameters as
was the case under the Dunn—Mcconnell assumptions, namely the yield on
infinite—maturity default—free debt and the interest—rate speed of adjustment.
A half percentage point decrease in the infinite—maturity yield increases the
call premium by 50 to 100 percent, and a decline in the speed of adjustment

from 0l5 to 0.05 doubles the premium.

Also, a halving of the variance scale

parameter cuts the call premia by 25 to 75 percent, with greater percentage
reductions (but smaller absolute ones) occurring at higher spot rates.

13% Coupon

In general, the call premium in our third base case (see Table 6) is
less sensitive than the premium was in the other two cases to equal absolute
changes in parameter values, but the premium is equally sensitive to
equivalent percentage changes.

Consider the responses to changes in the yield

on infinite—maturity default—free debt and the interest—rate speed of
adjustment.

A half point decline in the former increased the call premium by

50 percent in our analysis of 8% coupons here a three—quarter point decline
is required to cause the same impact.

Similarly, the increase in the speed of

adjustment from 0.05 to 0.15 halved the premium in the 8% coupon case; here an
increase from 0.15 to 0.35 is necessary.

ote, however, that in each of these

examples the same percentage changes in values yield comparable premium
impacts (e.g., a 0.005

increase on a base of 0.0775 is the same as a 0.0075

increase on a base of 0.1175)

the 30—year level payment mortgage.

There are two tables (a and b)

for each

mortgage in order to compute sensitivities of the call to all six of the
parameter values.

Following analysis of these mortgage contracts, we briefly

consider differences in call premia on 13 percent 30—year GNMAs with different
remaining years to maturity.

15—Year Level Payment
At a 11.75

percent spot rate and the base case parameter values, the

15—year mortgage would be priced 44 cents above par and the call is valued at
$1.79 (see the middle column of any segment of Tables 7a or 7b except that for
taxes) .

This is one—third ($0.90) less than the call value on a JO—year

mortgage; 15 years call protection is worth less than 30 years.

Note,

however, that on a coupon—equivalent basis the call value is only 10 percent
less

(33 versus 37 basis points)

-

While 15 years of call is worth less than

30 years, the coupons on the 15—year mortgage will be received for a shorter
period and on lower balances than the coupons on a JO—year mortgage.
The lower halves of all segments of Tables 7a and 7b suggest an
insensitivity of the difference in call premia on 15— and 30—year level—
payment mortgages to virtually all parameters: Except for low spot rates, the
15—year premium is 2 to 9 basis points less than the JO—year premium; at low
spot rates a slight positive difference exists.

The exceptions are for very

low spot rates (instruments close to being called where the expected
difference in lives is small) and for a low risk environment

combined with high spot rates.

Graduated Payment Mortgages (GPMs)
Tables 8a — 8b indicate the results for the
graduated—payment mortgage.

Because these mortgages have a longer effective maturity than
the 30—year
level—payment mortgage, the call has a higher value.

At a spot rate of 11.75

percent and the base case values, the difference is $0.33 or 10 percent.

In

this case, the premia in the coupon rates are nearly identical for
virtually

any configuration of parameter values and spot rates.

While the value of call

is greater with a GPM, the coupon will be earned on a larger valued
mortgage
over its life.

Differences in Remaining Years to Maturity
Table 9 contains prices, call values, and coupon—equivalent call
premia
for standard (3cJ—year original term, level—payment) 13 percent
GNMA5 with

differing remaining years to maturity for our base case parameter values.
first column reproduces the results from Table 6 for a new—issue
remaining life) GNMA.

The

(30 years

The next two columns refer to the same underlying GNMA

four and eight years after the date of issue (26 and 22 remaining
years to
maturity, respectively).

At high spot rates, the call value (and coupon—

equivalent premium) is about 25 percent less on the eight year old GNMA
than
on the newly issued one; at low spot rates, the difference is only about 5
percent.

Because call is worth considerably less when spot rates are high,

the absolute difference in call values is relatively constant.

And this

difference is a small S basis points in terms of coupon equivalents.

Thus

whether one purchases an old or new GNMA (with the same coupon) does not
seem
to be of great importance.

Summary

Substantial effort has been expended in estimating the magnitudes
of the
parameters governing the interest—rate process and measuring the sensitivity
of call values to these parameters and refinancing costs.

Unfortunately, the

results are not encouraging for application of the option pricing model
to
real world data. -The interest—rate process is not estimated with great
precision; substantial uncertainty remains regarding the speed of
adjustment
(k) ,

and the data do not discriminate

among different values of the elasticity

of the standard deviation (a) with

respect to the spot rate of interest.

All

and all, there is not overwhelming evidence for the existence of a stable,
single state variable mean—reverting CES process.

Substantial uncertainty

also exists regarding the magnitude of the refinancing wedge.

These

difficulties are compounded by the sensitivity of the estimated call values to
virtually all the parameters about which we are uncertain.
Nonetheless, some interesting results have been obtained.

The

differences in call premia in coupon rates among alternative long—term fixed—
rate mortgage contracts (15— and 30—year level—payment and 3O—year graduated—
payment mortgages) are relatively small and insensitive to alternative
parameter values.

While the dollar value of call is less on the 15—year

mortgage than on the 30—year level—payment mortgage, the premium built into
the coupon to earn a given call value has to be relatively greater on the
former because the coupon will be received for a shorter period.

Thus the

coupon—equivalents are roughly equal and the differences between them are not
sensitive to differences in parameter values.
graduated—payment mortgages (GPM5)

;

The reverse is true for

the dollar value of call is more than that

on the 30—year level—payment mortgage, but a somewhat smaller premium needs to

—31—

be changed to earn a given call value because the mortgage principal on the
GPM will continually exceed that on the 30—year level—payment mortgage.

Here

the coupon equivalents are nearly identical and are quite insensitive to
differences in parameter values.

Finally, differences in call premia on

near—par GNMAs with the same coupons but with different remaining lives are
