How Much of Chinese Exports is Really Made In China? Assessing Domestic Value-Added
When Processing Trade is Pervasive

ABSTRACT
The rise of China in world trade has brought both benefits and anxiety to other economies. For many
policy questions, it is crucial to know the extent of domestic value added (DVA) in exports, but the
computation is more complicated when processing trade is pervasive. We propose a method for computing
domestic and foreign contents that allows for processing trade. By our estimation, the share of domestic
content in exports by the PRC was about 50% before China’s WTO membership, and has risen to
over 60% since then. There are also interesting variations across sectors. Those sectors that are likely
labeled as relatively sophisticated such as electronic devices have particularly low domestic content
(about 30% or less).

1. Introduction

“Made in China” is one of the most common labels one encounters in a shopping mall in
the United States and Europe. Increasingly, many products that are supposed to be
technically sophisticated and therefore likely to be associated with exports from highincome countries, such as digital cameras and computers, also carry that label. Since the
most salient characteristic of the factor endowment in China is a vast supply of unskilled
labor relative to either physical or human capital, is the country’s actual export structure
inconsistent with the predictions from the international trade theory based on its
endowment? A possible resolution to the puzzle is that China is simply the last section of
a long global production chain that ends up assembling components from various
countries into a final product before it is exported to the US and EU market. Indeed, a
MacBook computer carries a label at its back (in small type) that reads “Designed by
Apple in California; Assembled in China.” This label is likely to be oversimplified
already, as it reports only the head and the tail of a global production chain, but skips
many other countries that supply other components that go into the product.
China is the archetype of a national economy that is well integrated into a global
production chain. It imports raw material, equipment, and intermediate inputs, and then
exports a big fraction of its output (on the order of 37% of GDP in 2006) to the world
market. The PRC is not the only country whose production and exports are a part of a
global chain; Japan, Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia are some other examples of
countries that participate actively in the international divisions of labor. However, the
PRC is noteworthy due to its sheer size. In addition, its export/GDP ratio, at 35% or
higher in recent years, is extraordinarily high for a large economy, when compared with
8% for the US and 13% for India. With a reputation as a “world factory,” China is a top
supplier of manufacturing outsourcing for many global companies.
For many policy issues, it is important to assess the extent of domestic content in
exports. For example, what is the effect of a currency appreciation on a country’s
exports? The answer depends crucially on the share of domestic content in the exports.
Other things being equal, the lower the share of domestic content in the exports, the
smaller the effect on trade volume a given exchange rate appreciation would have. As
1

another example, what is the effect of trading with the PRC on US income inequality?
The answer depends in part on whether the PRC simply exports products that are
intensive in low-skilled labor or whether its exports are more sophisticated. Rodrik
(2006) notes that the per capita income typically associated with the kind of goods bundle
that the PRC exports is much higher than the country’s actual income. He interprets this
as evidence that the skill content of its exports is likely to be much higher than its
endowment may imply. Schott (2008) documents an apparent rapid increase in the
similarity between the PRC’s export structure and that of high-income countries, and
interprets it as evidence of a rise in the level of sophistication embedded in the country’s
exports. Wang and Wei (2008a) use disaggregated regional data to investigate the
determinants of the rise in export sophistication. Indeed, many other observers have
expressed fear that the PRC is increasingly producing and exporting sophisticated
products and may be providing wage competition for mid- to high-skilled workers in the
US and Europe. However, the calculations by Rodrik (2006) and Schott (2008) do not
take into account the imported content in the country’s exports. If the domestic content in
exports from the PRC is low, especially in sectors that would have been considered
sophisticated or high-skilled in the US, then imports from the PRC may still generate a
large downward pressure on the wage of the low-skilled Americans after all (as pointed
out by Krugman, 2008). These are important policy questions and have implications for
both developing and developed countries. A good understanding of the nature and extent
of global supply chains can provide important insights for economists and policy makers.
How would one assess foreign versus domestic content in a country’s exports?
Hummels et al. (2001) (HIY in subsequent discussion) propose a method to decompose a
country’s exports into domestic and foreign value added share based on a country’s
input-output (IO) table. They make a key assumption that the intensity in the use of
imported inputs is the same between production for exports and production for domestic
sales. This assumption is violated in the presence of processing exports. Processing
exports are characterized by imports for exports with favorable tariff treatment: firms
import parts and other intermediate materials from abroad, with tariff exemptions on the
imported inputs and other tax preferences from local or central governments, and, after
processing or assembling, export the finished products. The policy preferences for
2

processing exports usually lead to a significant difference in the intensity of imported
intermediate inputs in the production of processing exports and that in other demand
sources (for domestic final sales and normal exports). Since processing exports have
accounted for more than 50% of China's exports every year at least since 1996, the HIY
formula is likely to lead to a significant under-estimation of the share of foreign value
added in its exports. In fact, most economies offer tariff reductions or exemptions on
imported intermediate inputs used in production for exports. Ignoring processing exports
is likely to lead to estimation errors, especially for economies that engage in a massive
amount of tariff/tax-favored processing trade, such as the China, Mexico and Viet Nam.
In this paper, we aim to make two contributions to the literature. First, we present
a formula for computing shares of foreign and domestic value added in a country’s
exports when processing exports are pervasive. We develop this formula because the
production technology and input sourcing differs for goods produced for domestic
consumption and normal exports compared to those produced under export processing
regimes. The HIY formula is a special case of this general formula. Second, we apply
our methodology to China using data for 1997, 2002, and 2007. We estimate that the
share of foreign value added in China’s manufactured exports was about 50% during
1997 to 2002 before China’s WTO membership, almost twice as high as that implied by
the HIY formula, and has risen to over 60% in 2007 after 5 years of its WTO
membership. There are also interesting variations across sectors. Those sectors that are
likely labeled as relatively sophisticated such as computers, telecommunication
equipments, and electronic devices have particularly low domestic content (about 30% or
less). By design, this is an accounting exercise, and does not intend to examine the
determinants, driving forces and the consequences of changes in domestic contents in
China’s gross exports thoroughly. However, a solid methodology to estimate and account
domestic and foreign value added in developing countries exports is the necessary first
step toward a better understanding of these issues.
Besides the papers on vertical specialization in the international trade literature,
this paper is also related to the I/O literature. In particular, Chen et al. (2004) and Lau et
al (2007) are the first to develop a “non-competitive” type I/O model for China (i.e., one

3

in which imported and domestically produced inputs are accounted for separately) and to
incorporate processing exports explicitly. However, these papers do not describe a
systematic way to infer separate input-output coefficients for production of processing
exports versus those for other final demands. It is therefore difficult for others to replicate
their estimates or apply their methodology to other countries. In addition, they use an
aggregated version of China’s 1995 and 2002 input-output tables, respectively, to
perform their analysis, with 20 some goods producing industries. We provide a more upto-date and more disaggregated assessment of foreign and domestic values added in
Chinese exports with 83 goods producing industries. Finally, they impose an assumption
in estimating the import use matrix from the competitive type I/O table published by
China’s National Statistical Bureau: within each industry, the mix of the imported and
domestic inputs is the same in capital formation, intermediate inputs, and final
consumption. We relax this assumption by refining a method proposed in Dean, Fung,
and Wang (2007) that combines China’s processing imports statistics with United
Nations Broad Economic Categories (UNBEC) classification.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a conceptual
framework for estimating shares of domestic and foreign value added in a country’s
exports when processing exports are pervasive. It also describes a mathematic
programming procedure to systematically infer a set of I/O coefficients called for by the
new formula but not typically available from a conventional I/O table. Section 3 presents
the estimation results for Chinese exports. Section 4 evaluate the accuracy of the
estimation results by using an IO table with separate processing trade account complied
by Mexico national statistical agency based 2003 economic census. Section 5 concludes.

2. Conceptual Framework and Estimation Method
2.1 When special features of processing exports are not taken into account

We first discuss how domestic and foreign contents in a country’s exports can be
computed when it does not engage in any processing trade. The discussion follows the
input-output literature, and is the approach adopted (implicitly) by Hummels et al. (2001)

4

and Yi (2003). Along the way, we will point out a clear connection between the domestic
content concept and the concept of vertical specialization. 2
When imported and domestically produced intermediate inputs are accounted
separately, a value-based input-output table can be specified as follows: 3
AD X + Y D = X

(1)

AM X + Y M = M

(2)

uAD + uAM + Av = u

(3)

where AD = [aDij] is an nxn matrix of direct input coefficients of domestic products; AM =
[aMij] is an nxn matrix of direct inputs of imported goods; YD is an nx1 vector of final
demands for domestically produced products, including usage in gross capital formation,
private and public final consumption, and gross exports; YM is an n×1 vector of final
demands for imported products, including usages in gross capital formation, private and
public final consumption; X is a n×1 vector of gross output; M is a n×1 vector of imports;
Av = [avj] is a 1×n vector of each sector j’s ratio of value added to gross output, and u is a
1×n unity vector. Subscripts i and j indicate sectors, and superscripts D and M represent
domestically produced and imported products, respectively.
Equations (1) and (2) define two horizontal balance conditions for domestically
produced and imported products, respectively. A typical row k in Equation (1) specifies
that total domestic production of product k should be equal to the sum of the sales of
product k to all intermediate and final users in the economy (the final sales include
domestic consumption and capital formation, plus exports of product k). A typical row h
in Equation (2) specifies that the total imports of product h should be equal to the sum of
the sales of product h to all users in the economy, including intermediate inputs for all
sectors, plus final domestic consumption and capital formation. Equation (3) is both a
vertical balance condition, and an adding-up constraint for the input-output coefficients.
2

We use the terms “domestic value added” and “domestic content” interchangeably. Similarly, we use the
terms “foreign value added”, “foreign content”, and “vertical specialization” to mean the same thing.

3

Such a model is called a “non-competitive” model in the IO literature. HIY (2001) do not specify this
system explicitly but go straight to the implied Leontief inverse while Chen et al. (2004) specify only the
first two equations. A fully specified model facilitates better understanding of the connection between
vertical specialization and domestic content, and a comparison with the model in the next sub-section that
features processing exports.
5

It implies that the total output (X) in any sector k has to be equal to the sum of direct
value added in sector k, and the cost of intermediate inputs from all domestically
produced and imported products.
From Equation (1) we have
X = ( I − A D ) −1 Y D

(4) 4

( I − A D ) −1 is the well-known Leontief Inverse, a matrix of coefficients for the total

domestic intermediate product requirement. Define a vector of share of domestic content,
or domestic value added, in a unit of domestically produced products, DVS = {dvsj}, a
1×n vector, as the additional domestic value added generated by one additional unit of
final demand of domestic products (∆YD = u’):
∧

∧

DVS = Av ∆X / ∆Y D = Av ( I − A D ) −1 = Av ( I − A D ) −1

(5)

where AˆV an nxn diagonal matrix with avj as its diagonal elements. Equation (5) indicates
that the domestic content for an IO industry is the corresponding column sum of the
coefficient matrix for total domestic intermediate goods requirement, weighted by the
direct value-added coefficient of each industry. Because standard model assumes that
exports and domestic sales are produced by the same technology, the share of domestic
content in final demand and the share of domestic content in total exports are the same.
So Equation (5) is also the formula for the share of domestic content in total exports for
each industry.
Define a vector of share of foreign content (or foreign value added) in final
demand for domestically produced products by FVS = u – DVS. By making use of
Equation (3), it can be verified that
FVS = u − Av ( I − A D ) −1 = uA M ( I − A D ) −1

(6)

For each industry, this is the column sum of the coefficient matrix for total intermediate
import requirement. This turns out to be the same formula used to compute vertical
specialization by Hummels et al. (2001). In other words, the concepts of vertical
specialization and of foreign content are identical.

4

( I − A D ) has to be full rank.

2.2 Domestic Content in Exports When Processing Trade is Prevalent
We now turn to the case in which tariff-favored processing exports are prevalent;
these exports have a different intensity in the use of imported inputs than do domestic
final sales (and normal exports). Conceptually, we wish to keep track separately of the IO
coefficients of the processing exports and those of domestic final sales and normal
exports. For now, we ignore the fact that these IO coefficients may not be directly
available, and will discuss a formal approach to estimate them in the next subsection.
The expanded I/O table with a separate account for processing exports is
represented by Figure 1.

We use superscript P and D, respectively, to represent processing exports on one
hand, and domestic sales and normal exports on the other. This expanded IO model can
be formally described by the following system of equations:

uA DD + uA MD + AvD = u

(9)

or

uA DP + uA MP + AvP = u

(10)

This is a generalization of the model discussed in the previous subsection. Equations (7)
and (8) are a generalization of Equations (1)–(2), and Equations (9)–(10) are a
generalization of Equation (3), with a separate account for processing exports. Equations
(9) and (10) are also the new adding-up constraint for the IO coefficients.

(12)

Substituting Equation (12) into Equation (11), we have:
X − E P = ( I − A DD ) −1 (Y D − E P ) + (1 − A DD ) −1 A DP E p

(13)

Substituting Equation (13) into Equation (8), the total demand for imported intermediate
inputs is
M − Y M = A MD ( I − A DD ) −1 (Y D − E P ) + A MD (1 − A DD ) −1 A DP E P + A MP E p (14)
It has three components: the first term is total imported content in final domestic sale and
normal exports, and the second and the third terms are indirect and direct imported
content in processing exports, respectively.
We can compute vertical specialization (VS) or foreign content share in
processing and normal exports in each industry separately:

The total foreign content share in a particular industry is the sum of the two weighted by
the share of processing and non-processing exports sp and u−sp, where both s and u are a

where te is a scalar, the country’s total exports. Equation (16) is a generalization of
Equation (7), the formula to compute industry-level share of vertical specialization.
Equation (17) is a generalization of the formula for country-level share of vertical
specialization proposed by Hummels et al. (2001, page 80). In particular, either when
A DD = A DP and A MD = A MP , or when EP/te = 0, Equation (18) reduces to the HIY
formula for VS.
Similarly, the domestic content share for processing and normal exports at the
industry level can be computed separately:

The total domestic content share in a particular industry is a weighted sum of the two:

(20)

Either when A DD = A DP and AvD = AvP , or when EP/te = 0, Equation (20) reduces to the
HIY formula in Equation (5). Note we can easily verify that for both processing and
normal exports, the sum of domestic and foreign content shares is unity.

2.3 Estimation Issues
Equations (18-20) allows us to compute the shares of domestic content in
processing and normal exports for each industry as well as in a country’s total exports.
However, statistical agencies typically only report a traditional I/O matrix, AD, and
sometimes AM, but not ADP, ADD, AMP and AMD separately. Therefore, a method to estimate
these matrices, based on available information, has to be developed. In this sub-section,

9

we propose to do this via a quadratic programming model by combining information
from trade statistics and conventional I/O tables.
The basic idea of this model is to use information from the standard I/O table to
determine sector-level total imports/exports, and information from trade statistics to
determine the relative proportion of processing and normal exports within each sector,
thus use up all available data to split the national economy into processing and nonprocessing blocks, each with its own IO structure. Using the data from the I/O table to
determine sector-level total imports/exports helps to ensure that the balance conditions in
the official I/O account are always satisfied, and that the I/O table with separate
processing and non-processing accounts estimated from the model always sums to the
published official table. Such a method is a formalization of the calibration methods
widely used in macroeconomics and CGE modeling when the number of endogenous
variables larger than the number of equations.
The following data are observable from a standard I/O table:
xi = Gross output of sector i;

z ij = Goods i used as intermediate inputs in sector j;
v j = Value-added in sector j;
mi = Total imports of sector i goods; and
yi =Total final demand except for exports of goods i.

`

We combine those observed data from the I/O table and processing trade shares 5

observed from trade statistics to determine the values for:
mip = Imports of sector i good used as intermediate inputs to produce processing

exports;
mid = Imports of sector i goods used as intermediate inputs for domestic
production and normal exports;
ein = Normal exports of sector i ; and
eip = Processing exports of sector i.

The partition of imports into intermediate and final use is based on a combination
of China custom import statistics and UN BEC classification, as described in Dean, Fang
5

Processing trade are defined by China Customs, which include trade regime “Process & assembling "(14)
and “Process with imported materials" (15) in China Customs statistics. These statistics are relatively
accurate because they involve duty exemption and value-added tax rebates which under intensive Customs
monitoring.
10

and Wang (2011). The results of such partition and the actual numbers used in our
empirical estimation are reported and discussed in the data source subsection later.
Parameters on domestic and imported final demand can be inferred from the observed
data discussed above:
y im = Final demand of goods i from imports (residuals of mi - mip - mid );

y id = Final demand of goods i provided by domestic production (residual of y i y im ).

All those data based on official statistics are entered our estimation model as constants.
Define z ijdd = Domestically produced intermediate good i used by sector j for
domestic sales and normal exports; z ijdp = Domestically produced intermediate good i
used by sector j for processing exports; z ijmd = Imported intermediate good i used by
sector j for domestic sales and normal exports; z ijmp = Imported intermediate good i used
d

by sector j for processing exports; v j

=

To obtain these unobservable IO coefficients, we need estimate within-industry

(29)

The economic meanings of these 9 groups of constraints are straightforward.
Equations (21) and (22) are row sum identities for the expanded I/O account. They state
that total gross output of sector i has to equal to the sum of domestic intermediaries, final
demand and exports (both processing and normal exports) in that sector. Similarly, total
imports have to equal imported intermediate inputs plus imports delivered to final users.
Equations (23) and (24) are column sum identities for the expanded I/O account. They
define the value of processing exports in sector j as the sum of domestic and imported
intermediate inputs as well as primary factors used in producing processing exports; these
four groups of constraints correspond to equations (7)-(10) in the extended I/O model
respectively. Equations (25) to (29) are a set of adding up constraints to ensure that the
solution from the model is consistent with official statistics on sector-level trade and
within-industry transactions. Suppose there are K sectors, then there will be 4K2 + 2K
unknowns and only 7K+K2 independent constraints, so we have to cast the calibration
problem as a constrained optimization procedure to minimize following objective
functions:

Where z’s and v’s are variables to be estimated, those variables with a 0 in the suffix
denote initial values.
These initial values are guesses about the values of variables based on official
statistics using proportional assumptions (will discuss below). However, because all
parameters in the 9 groups of linear constraints (right hand side of equations (21) to (29))
were directly or indirectly obtained from observable official statistical sources, model
solutions thus are restricted into a convex set and will be relatively stable respect to
variations in these initial values as long as all the parameters in these linear constraints
kept as constants.
The initial value of zijmd and zijmd, are generated by allocating mid and mip in
proportion to input i’s usage in sector j as equation (31):

The split of total inter-sector intermediate inputs flow from sector i to sector j
between normal and processing use are based on their proportion in gross output. The

The initial values for direct value added in the production for processing exports
in sector j ( v0 pj ), are generally set to be the residuals implied by Equation (24).
However, we set a minimum value at the sum of labor compensation and depreciation in
13

a sector multiplied by the share of processing exports in that sector’s total output. In other
words, the initial value v0 pj is set to equal the greater of the residuals from Equation (24)
or the minimum value. The initial value for direct value added in the production for
domestic sales and normal exports ( v0dj ) is set as the difference between v j (from the I/O
table) and v0 pj .
We conduct some sensitivity checks using alternative initial values to empirically
verify whether the model solutions are sensitive to these initial values. It turns out that
these alternative initial values do not materially alter our basic conclusions. We
implement this quadratic programming model in GAMS (Brooke et al, 2005), related
computer programs and data files will be available at the USITC website for
downloading.

3. Estimation Results
After describing the data sources, we report and discuss the estimation results for
shares of domestic and foreign content in Chinese exports at the aggregate level, and by
sector, firm ownership and major destination countries.
3.1 Data
Inter-industry transaction and (direct) value-added data are from China’s 1997, 2002
and 2007 benchmark I/O tables published by the National Bureau of Statistics of China
(NBS). We use detailed exports and imports data of 1997, 2002, and 2007 from the
General Customs Administration of China to help differentiate the processing and normal
trade in each sector. The trade statistics are first aggregated from the 8-digit HS level to
China’s I/O industries, and then used to compute the share of processing exports in each
I/O industry. Modifying a method from Dean, Fung and Wang (2009), we partition all
imports in a given commodity classification into three parts based on the distinction
between processing and normal imports in the trade statistics, and on the UN BEC
classification scheme:

(a) intermediate inputs in producing processing exports; (b)

intermediate inputs for normal exports and other domestic final sales; and (c) those used
in gross capital formation and final consumption. A summary of these trade statistics as a
percentage of China’s total imports along with share of processing exports during 199614

2008 is reported in Table 1, which shows a downward trend for the use of imported
inputs in producing processing exports, and an upward trend in their use in producing
normal trade and domestic final sales. Processing exports as a share of China’s total
merchandise exports also gradually decline in recent years. Such trend seems partially
reflects the consequence of a series of policy measures to change the preferences to
processing trade and foreign invested enterprises has adopted by Chinese government
since the end of 2006.
Detailed trade share parameters for each I/O industry in the three benchmark year
(1997, 2002, and 2007) are listed in Appendix tables A-C. These data computed directly
from detailed Chinese official trade statistics are important to understand our estimates of
domestic and imported content in Chinese gross exports, especially their change trends
over time.
(Inset Table 1 here)

3.2 Domestic and foreign contents in total exports
Table 2 presents the results for the decomposition of aggregate foreign and
domestic value-added shares in 1997, 2002 and 2007. For comparison, the results from
the HIY method that ignores processing trade are also reported. The estimated aggregate
domestic value added share in China’s merchandise exports was 54% in 1997, and 60.6%
in 2007. For manufacturing products, these estimated shares are slightly lower in levels
but trending upward significantly at 50% in 1997 and 59.7% in 2007, respectively. In
general, the estimated direct domestic value-added shares are less than half of the total
domestic value-added shares. However, the estimated indirect foreign value-added share
was relatively small; most of the foreign content comes from directly imported foreign
inputs, especially in 1997 and 2002. The indirect foreign value-added increase over time,
and reach about a quarter of China’s directly imported foreign inputs in 2007, indicating
the share of simple processing and assembling of foreign parts is declining, while more
imported intermediates are being used in the production of other intermediate inputs that
are then used in the production process.
(Insert table 2 here)

15

Relative to the estimates from the HIY method, our procedure produces estimates
of a much higher share of foreign value added in Chinese gross exports and with a
different trend over time. To be more precise, estimates from the HIY method show that
the foreign content share (total VS share) increased steadily from 17.6% in 1997 to
28.7% in 2007 for all merchandise exports, and from 19.0% to 27.1% for manufacturing
only during the same period. In contrast, our estimates suggest a trend in the opposite
direction, with the share of foreign value added in all merchandise exports falling from
46% in 1997 to 39.4% in 2007, and a similar decline for the share in manufacturing
exports, it fell from 50% in 1997 to 40.3% in 2007. The decline occur mainly during
2002-2007 period, which corresponds to the first 5 years of China’s entry to the WTO.
Our estimates indicate that the HIY method appears to incorrectly estimate both the level
and the trend in domestic versus foreign content in the PRC’s exports.
What accounts for the difference between ours and HIY approaches? There are at
least three factors drive the change of foreign content of the country’s gross exports: (1)
the relative proportions of its total imports used as intermediate inputs in producing
processing exports and domestic sales & normal exports; (2) the share of processing
exports in its total exports; and (3) the sector composition of its exports. Because
processing exports tend to use substantially more imported inputs, and processing exports
account for a major share of China’s total exports, the HIY indicator is likely to
substantially underestimate the true for foreign content in China’s exports. This explains
the level of domestic content by our measure is much lower than that of the HIY
indicator. On the other hand, as exporting firms (both those producing for normal exports
and those for processing exports) gradually increase their intermediate inputs sourcing
from firms within China or multinationals move their upstream production to be near
their downstream production, the extent of domestic content in exports rose over time.
This exactly is what has happened since China joining the WTO. However, because
exports from industries with relatively lower domestic content often grow faster due to
dramatic inflow of foreign direct investment, the composition of a countries total exports
may play as an offsetting factor to reduce the share of domestic value-added in the
country’s gross exports thus slow down the increase of domestic value-added share in a
country’s total exports. As Chinese government start to reduce the policy incentives for
16

both Foreign Invested Enterprises (FIE) and processing exports at the end of 2006, we are
observing a trend of increasing domestic contents in Chinese exports as China continue
its industrial upgrading in the years to come.
Our interpretation is confirmed by DVA shares for processing and normal exports
estimated separately (Table 3). There is a more than 10 percentage point increase in the
total foreign value-added share for domestic sales and normal exports between 1997 and
2007, which is consistent with the trend indicated by HIY measure. However, in
processing exports we see that more domestic-produced inputs were used, domestic
value-added share increased from 20.7% in 1997 to 37.0% in 2007, up more than 16
percentage point. Because processing exports still constitute more than 50% of China’s
total exports in 2007, which resulting the weighted average total domestic value-added
share went up during the decades.
There are conflicting forces at work. On the one hand, as domestic input suppliers
increase their quality over time, and multinationals move more and more of their
upstream production into China, exporting firms may decide to increase local sourcing of
their inputs. On the other hand, the reductions in the country’s trade barriers also
encourage exporting firms to use more imported inputs. These two opposing forces
partially offset each other. However, on net, the domestic content share in China’s
exports appears to be on the rise. Looking ahead, the share of imported content in
exports could fall or rise, depending on the relative speed with which domestic input
suppliers and multi-nationals can step up their quality and variety versus the extent of
additional reductions in the cost of using imported inputs.
(insert table 3 here)
We perform a number of robustness checks on the sensitivity of our main results
to alternative ways of setting the initial values of the variables and the share parameters
of import use. First, we initialize v0 pj and v0dj by apportioning the observed direct value
added in a sector to processing exports and other final demands based on their respective
portions in the sector’s total output. Second, we initialize v0 pj either at the residuals
implied by equation (24) if the residuals are positive, or by following the previous
alternative if the residuals are non-positive. Third, when we partition imports into
17

different users, we use the average of a three-year period (previous, current, and
following years) rather than just one year’s statistics. Fourth, we experiment with 0%
versus 10% annual depreciation rate for capital goods. These variations produce
relatively little change in the main results. For example, the estimated share of domestic
value added in manufacturing exports lies in a relatively narrow range between ?% and
?% in 2002, and between ?% and ?% in 2007.

3.3 Domestic content in exports by firm ownership
Since foreign-invested firms account for over half of China’s exports, compare
the share of domestic content in exports between them and other Chinese firms may help
us better to understand why there is a raising trend of domestic value-added share in
China’s total exports. However, there is no information on separate input-output
coefficients by firm ownership, our estimation assumes that they are the same on this
dimension. The variation in the share of domestic content comes from different degrees
of reliance on processing exports with a sector, and differences in the sector composition
of their total exports.
Estimates of the domestic content shares by firm ownership are presented in Table
4. The results show that exports by wholly foreign owned enterprises exhibit the lowest
share of domestic valued-added (at 33.4% in 2002 and increase to 44.1% in 2007),
followed by Sino-foreign joint venture companies (about 44% in both 2002 and 2007).
Exports from Chinese private enterprises embodied the highest domestic content shares
(83.9% and 80.8% in 2002 and 2007, respectively), while those from the state-owned
firms were in the middle (about 70% in both years). Note that these estimates represent
the best guesses based on currently available information; better estimates can be derived
once information on I/O coefficients by firm ownership becomes available.
The most noticeable feature of this table is the raising domestic contents in export
produced by foreign invested firms, their DVA share increased more than 10 percentage
points between 2002 to 2007(There is a 10.5% percentage point increase for wholly
Foreign Owned firms, and a 13.6 percentage point increase for joint ventures), while
DVA share of Chinese domestic firms basically stay steady during the same period. This
indicates the raise of domestic contents in Chinese exports during the first 5 years of
18

China in WTO is mainly due to FIE sourcing more of their intermediate inputs within
China. This is consistent with the observation of more and more multinationals move
their upstream production to China getting closer to their downstream production already
in China and FIE using more and more intermediate inputs from local suppliers.
Further exam the change of domestic value-added share across firms with the
same ownership but engage in processing and non-processing exports reveals that firms
engage in normal exports and domestic sales used more imported intermediate inputs
while firms engage in processing exports sourced more of their intermediate inputs
domestically, regardless their ownership types. Therefore, we can conclude that the raise
of domestic value-added content share in Chinese exports are majorly caused by China’s
processing exports using more locally supplied intermediate inputs in 2007 than that in
2002 6. If this trend continues, the difference in the intensity of using imported inputs for
processing and non-processing exports will be further reduced in next decades.
(Insert table 4 here)
3.4 Domestic content by sector
To see if there are interesting patterns at the sector level that helps to explain the
decline trend of imported contents in China’s total exports, and further assess whether the
increasing domestic value-added share reflect actual upgrade of Chinese industrial
structure, Tables 5 and 6 report, in ascending order on domestic content share, the valueadded decomposition in China manufacturing exports by industry in 2002 and 2007
respectively, together with shares of processing and foreign invested enterprises exports
in each sector’s exports as well as the sector’s share in China’s total merchandise exports.
We choose to report the results from 2002 and 2007 not only because we would like use
the latest I/O table released but also due to these two benchmark tables are consistently
classified on most recent Chinese industry classifications, which simplifies issues
involved in overtime comparison. Similar results for 1997 are omitted to save space.
Among the 57 manufacturing industries in the table, 15 have a share of domestic
value-added in their exports less than 50 percent in 2002, and collectively account for
6

Domestic value-added is a concept consistent with Gross Domestic products, which measures the value
creation production activities occurring with national boarder regardless firm ownerships.
19

nearly 35 percent of China’s merchandise exports that year. Many low-DVA industries
are likely to be labeled as relatively sophisticated, such as telecommunication equipment,
electronic computer, measuring instruments, and electronic devices. A common feature
of these industries is that processing exports account for over two-thirds of their exports
and foreign invested enterprises played an overwhelming role. In 2007, the number of
industry with less than 50 percent domestic contents in their exports declined into 10, but
their exports count for more than 32 percent of China’s total merchandise exports and
these low-DVA industry are more concentrated in high-tech sectors. There are 11
industries in the top 15 low-DVA industries in 2002 still remain in the15 top low-DVA
industries in 2007.
(insert table 5 and table 6 here)
The next 18 industries in table 6 have their share of domestic value-added in the
range of 51 to 65 percent; they collectively accounted for 28 percent of China’s total
merchandise exports in 2002. Several labor-intensive sectors are in this group, such as
furniture, toys and sports products, Leather, fur, down and related products.
The remaining 24 industries have relatively high shares of domestic value-added.
However, they as a group produced only less than 30 percent of China’s total
merchandise exports in 2002. Apparel, the country’s largest labor intensive exporting
industry, which by itself was responsible for 7 percent of the country’s total merchandise
exports in 2002, is at the top of this group with a share of domestic content at 66 percent.
The 12 industries at the bottom of Table 6 with DVA share more than 75 percent
collectively produced only less 10 percent of China’s total merchandise exports in 2002.
The weights of high-DVA industries in China’s exports increased significantly in
2007. There are, the number of industries with DVA share more than 75 percent increase
to 25 in 2007 (bottom of Table 7), and their exports constitute more than 30 percent of
China’s total merchandise exports in 2007. Among these High-DVA industries, we not
only see the traditional labor industries such as furniture, textiles and apparel still play an
significant role (account for more than half of these high DVA-sector exports) , but also
the increasing role of heavy and capital intensive industries such as automobile, industrial
machinery and rolling steel (account for nearly one thirds of these high-DVA sector’s

20

exports). The data clearly indicate China’s industrial upgrade is real and FIEs have
played very important role in this process.
3.5 DVA shares in Chinese exports by trading partners
By assuming domestic and foreign value added shares in per unit gross exports
are the same for all destination countries in each IO industry and export regime, we can
further estimate the domestic value-added share in China’s exports to each of its major
trading partners. The decomposition results for China’s total merchandise exports to each
of its major trading partners are reported in Table 7 in increasing order of the estimated
domestic value-added share. Note, however, the variation by destination in this method
is caused solely by China’s export structure to each of its trading partners (exports to
each individual country/region vary by sector and trade regime structures), not the direct
input intensities of imported intermediates in producing such exports.
Hong Kong, the United States, Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia are at the top of
the table in both 2002 and 2007, with less than or about 50/60 percent of China’s
domestic value-added embodied in its exports to these five destinations in 2002 and 2007
respectively. Since a large portion of Chinese exports to Hong Kong are re-exports to the
United States, the U.S. remain as China’s largest exports market in both 2002 and 2007.
The lower domestic value-added share in its exports to the U.S. may partially explain
why Chinese exports continued their rapid expansion in the U.S. market despite RMB
gradually appreciation since July 2005. China’s exports to the U.S. have started to slow
down since 2008 when China return to peg exchange its rate to U.S. dollars because the
world financial crisis, likely because of other macro economic factors and policy
measures adopted by the Chinese government during last year. 7
(Insert table 7 here)
Another interesting feature in Table 8 is that China’s exports to developing
countries embody much higher domestic valued added than its exports to OECD
countries, but exports with higher domestic value-added (more than two thirds of the
gross value of its exports) constituted of less than 13 percent of its total exports of goods
7

China has taken a series of policy measures to change its preferences to processing trade and
foreign invested enterprises since the end of 2006.
21

in 2002, this share raised to about 20 percent in 2007. It is also interesting to note that the
domestic value-added share in China’s exports to high income country was increased
between 2002 and 2007, while they are declined for exports to developing countries (split
at the row of Mexico in the middle of table 8) indicating relatively more local supplied
inputs were used to making exports to high income countries while relative more
imported inputs were used in producing exports to developing countries.

4. The accuracy of Content Share Estimates
As we discussed earlier, the estimation procedure presented in this paper is a
formalization and extension of calibration methods widely used in macroeconomics and CGE
modeling. Different from econometric model, evaluation on the accuracy of the calibration
largely rely on a benchmark data set from the real world. However, it is not very easy to find

such a benchmark data set to assess the accuracy of results from our estimation method
because the "true" IO account that separately trace processing exports and other
production transactions in national economy is rarely exist. Fortunately, Mexico’s
statistical agency, the Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Geografía e Informática (INEGI), has
complied 2003 benchmark IO table based on economic census, which have separate accounts for
Mexico domestic and Maquiladora industries 8, which is the major exports promotion program in
Mexico. The table includes national production of goods and services classified under Mexico’s
2002 3- and 4-digit NAICS, inputs purchased in the domestic and Maquiladora industries, and
imports from the rest of the world by both economies. The domestic and foreign content share

computed directly from this special Mexico IO table provides a reference benchmark to
test the performance of the estimation method we proposed. Based on exports and import
statistics for Maquiladora industries in the World Trade Atlas and Mexico's aggregate 2003 IO
table, we implemented the same quadratic programming model that generates domestic/foreign
content estimates for Chinese exports, to compute domestic and foreign value-added share in
Mexico manufacturing exports, and report the estimation results in Table 8.

The three panels in

table 8 lists direct/total domestic/foreign value-added share for normal, processing and total
exports respectively. To quantitatively assess know how much each set of value-added share
estimates differs from the "true" share data computed directly from the Mexico IO table with

8

We are grateful to INEGI for providing us with the input-output table.
22

a separate processing trade account, we report three type metrics in the three bottom row
of table 8.
The first bottom row list the absolute difference between the estimated share and the
"true" shares computed directly from Mexico IO table with a separate processing trade account
for manufacture as a whole. The errors for various share estimates seems less than 3 percentage
point. However, it is the proportionate errors and not the absolute errors that matter; therefore, we
computed the "Mean Absolute Percentage Error" with respect to the true shares as follows:
n

100 • ∑ | si − s 0 i |
MAPE =

i=1
n

∑ s0

i

i=1

where si is the estimated share and s0i share is the reference share for industry i. The
resulted index number is reported in the second bottom row. The error range from 4% to
17% for normal exports, 14% to 28% for processing exports and 12% to 15% for total
exports. Numbers in the last row of table 8 are the correlation coefficients between the
estimated share and the reference shares, they reveal that our estimates are highly
correlated with the true shares computed directly from Mexico IO table with a separate
processing trade account for normal and total exports, while the correlation are lower for
processing exports.

5. Concluding Remarks
Segmentation of production across countries allows for reductions in production
costs and more efficient allocation of resources. The opening-up of China has likely
facilitated this process. A quantitative assessment of the extent of its participation in
global production chains allows us to get a better grasp of many policy questions,
including the effect of an exchange rate change on bilateral trade balances.
In this paper, we first present a general framework in assessing the shares of
domestic and foreign value added in a country’s exports when tariff-favored processing
exports are pervasive. This formula nests the existing best known approach (HIY, 2001)
as a special case. Because some of the I/O coefficients called for by the new formula are
not readily available from conventional I/O tables, we propose an easy-to-replicate
mathematical programming procedure to estimate these coefficients by combining
information from detailed trade statistics (which records processing and normal
23

exports/imports separately) with conventional input-output tables. This methodology
should be applicable to Vietnam, Mexico, and many other developing countries that
engage in a significant amount of processing exports.
By applying our methodology to Chinese data We find several interesting
patterns. First, the share of foreign content in manufacturing exports from China was
close to 50% during 1997-2002, almost twice as high as that calculated using the HIY
formula. Second, the share of domestic content increased from 51% in 2002 to 60% in
2007, which corresponds to the first five years of China’s membership in the WTO. We
also report interesting heterogeneity across sectors: those sectors that are likely to be
labeled as sophisticated or high-skilled, such as computers, electronic devices, and
telecommunication equipment, tend to have notably low shares of domestic content.
Conversely, many sectors that are relatively intensive in low-skilled labor, such as
apparel, are likely to exhibit a high share of domestic content in the country’s exports.
Finally, we find that foreign invested firms (including both wholly-owned foreign firms
and Sino-foreign joint venture firms) tend to have a relatively low share of domestic
content in their exports.
There are several areas in which future research can improve upon the estimation
in this paper. First, we assign initial values of the direct domestic value added for
processing exports at the industry level based on the information in a conventional I/O
table. If a firm-level survey data becomes available that tracks the direct value added for
processing and normal exports separately, we can improve the accuracy of our estimates.
Second, as an inherent limitation of an I/O table, the input-output coefficients are
assumed to be fixed - that’s the nature of a Leontief technology - rather than be allowed
to respond to price changes. This could be problematic when a big change in export
volume, such as what China has been experiencing, induces a change in the world market
price for imported inputs, which in turn could trigger a change in the underlying
production technology and in the corresponding I/O coefficients. These could be fruitful
areas for future research.

Source: Authors’ calculations based on official China Custom trade statistics and the United
Nation Broad Economic Categories (UNBEC) classification scheme.
Note: “Normal use” refers to “normal exports and domestic sales.” The UNBEC scheme
classifies each HS 6-digit product into one of three categories: “intermediate inputs,” “capital
goods,” and “final consumption.” For the first two categories, we further decompose the imports
into two subcategories: “processing imports” by customs declaration are classified as used for
producing processing exports and cannot be sold to any domestic users by regulation, and the
remaining imports are classified as for normal use. Capital goods are part of the final demand in a
conventional I/O model (Column (1) to (5) sum to 100%). However, this classification may
under-estimate the import content of exports. We therefore also experiment with classifying a
fraction of the capital goods as inputs used in current year of production. This is discussed in
Section 3.2.

Source: Source: Authors’ estimates based on China's 2002 and 2007 Benchmark input-output table
published by Bureau of National Statistics and Official China trade statistics from China Customs.
Input/output structure is assumed to be the same for a given export regime within a sector across all
type firms. The variation of domestic value-added by firm types is due solely to variation in sector
composition and the relative reliance on processing exports.

Source: Authors’ estimates based on China's 2002 and 2007 Benchmark input-output table
published by Bureau of National Statistics and Official China trade statistics from China
Customs. Input/output structure is assumed to be the same for a given export regime within a
sector across all trading partners. The variation of domestic value-added by destination is due
solely to variation in sector composition and the relative reliance on processing exports.
