This

the possibility that this behaviour itself is a cause of

business cycles and of sticky prices. We

examine implicitly colluding

cligopolies that attempt to sustain above competitive profits by the
threat of reverting to competitive behavior to punish firms that do not

cooperate. The basic point of the paper is that the oligopolists find
implicit collusion of this kind more difficult when their demand is high.
In other words when an industry faces a boom in its demand, chiseling
away from the collusive level of output becomes more profitable for each

individual firm and thus the oligopoly can only sustain a less collusive
outcome. This suggests that when demand for goods produced by

oligopolists is high, the economy produces an allocation which is

'closer" to the competitive allocation and thus
possibility

acts
in

nearer the production

frontier. Insofar as the allocation in which the oligopoly

collusively is inside the production possibility frontier, a shift

demand towards the oligopolistic sector can increase the output of all

goods. The fact that the outputs of all goods tend to move together is,
of

course, the hallmark of business cycles. Thus we can interpret booms

in aggregate economic activity as being due to a shift in demand towards
the oligopolistic sectors and

busts

as shifts towards the competitive

sectors.

This analysis still leaves unexplained the causes of the shifts in
sectoral demands. To make sense of actual business cycles one would have

to relate these shifts in demand to changes in the money supply and

interest rates which are highly correlated with cyclical fluctuations.

scope of this paper it must be noted that these shifts form

of the popular discussions of the early stages of recoveries. At
that point consumers desire for cars and other durables usually picks
part

up.
The oligopolies we

consider know that

deviations from some agreed

upon strategy lead to punishments. Unfortunately there are usually a
multitude

of equilibria in such settings. These equilibria differ in the

mechanics by which reversion to punishing behavior takes place, by the
length and intensity of the punishment interval as well as by the amount
of collusion that takes place when the firms are not punishing each

other. One standard technique for choosing among these equilibria (see,
for example, Porter (1983a)) is to concentrate on the equilibrium that is
optimal from the point of view of the oligopolists.

Unfortunately it is often very difficult to characterize these

optima. Even Porte?s paper considers only linear demand and optimizes
only over a subset of all the possible strategies. In particular, he
considers

only punishments in which firms

act

as if they were involved in

a sequence of one—shot noncooperative games. Thus the most firms can do

to each other when they are punishing and being punished is to compete as

if they

were

playing a sequence of static games. This considerably

simplifies the analysis. Our

otherwise optimal supergames also embody

this assumption which is not essential in all cases.
In our model the reversion to competitive behaviour occurs for a

period

of infinite length. This length is optimal since it is the

biggest

never

credible threat and since, along the equilibrium path, firma

find themselves punishing each other. Instead for each state of

3

demand we focus on the outcome closest to monopoly that the oligopoly can

sustain given the threat. Any outcome closer to monopoly would lead to a
breakdown in discipline. Any outcome further from monopoly would simply

result in lower oligopoly profits. We show that when demand rises, the
best sustainable outcome generally becomes more competitive. Our

strongest results are for the case in which prices are the strategic
variable and there are constant marginal costs. Then an increase in
demand actually towers the oligopoly's prices monotonically after a

certain point. This occurs because keeping the oligopoly's price
constant when demand increases raises the payoff to a single firm from

towering its price slightly and thus capturing alt of demand. To deter
each firm from doing this the oligopoly must actually lower its price.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section II presents the optimal
supergame for both the cases in which the oligopoly treats prices and the
case in which it treats outputs as the strategic variable. Ye also
discuss

simpler games in

which, as in Breshnahan (1981), Green and

(1964) and Porter (1983b) the oligopoly can

only

behave either

monopolistically or competitively. It is then in general more likely to
behave competitively when demand is high. Section III establishes the
connection with macroeconomics. It describes a simple two
equilibrium

model in which oRe sector is

sector

general

oligopolistic and the other

sector is competitive. The oligopolistic sector's output is purchased
both by consumers and by the competitive sector. When demand shifts
towards the oligopolistic sector, this sector lowers its prices. This,
in turn, leads the competitive sector to increase its purchases from the
oligopolistic sector and

thus increase

its output as well. So both

4

sectors grow, only to shrink when demand moves back towards the

competitive sector or when the punishment period is over.
Any theory whose foundation is that competitive behaviour is more

likely to occur in booms must confront the tact that the industrial

organization folklore is that price wars occur in recessions. This
folklore is articulated in Sherer (1980) for example. Our basis for

rejecting this folklore is not theoretical. We concede that tt is
possible to construct models in which recessions induce price wars.
Instead

it

our rejection is

based on facts. First, at a very general level,

certainly appears that business cycles are related to sluggish

adjustment of prices (see Rotemberg (1982) for example). Prices rise too
little in booms and

fall

too little

in

recessions. If recessions tended

to produce massive price wars this would be an unlikely finding. !€ore
specifically we analyze some other sources of data capable of shedding

light on the folklore. That we find is that

Scherer's evidence and

of the cyclical properties of price cost margins supports

our theory. Our theory is also supported by an analysis, of the price
wars purported to have happened in the automobile industry (Bresnahan

(1981)) and the railroad industry (Porter (1983a)). These wars have
occurred

in periods of high demand. Finally, since Sherer singles out

the cenent industry as having repeated break—ups of its cartel during
recessions,

we study the cyclical properties of cement prices. To our

surprise, cement prices are strongly countercyclical even though cement,
as construction as a whole, has

a

procyclical level of output. These

empirical regularities are discussed in Section IV. We conclude with
Section V.

such models

cannot sign binding contracts, i.e. noncooperating firms in the
usual sense, are usually able to sustain outcomes in any period that strictly
even

firws that

dominate

the outcorte in the corresponding one—period game.

In order to achieve this the equilibrium strategies must involve a mechanism
that deters

an individual firm from "cheating" (by expanding output or by shading

prices). One such mechanism and one that has been fruitfuilly employed in

theoretical models2, is the use of punishments against the defecting firm
periods

in

following the defection. If such punishments are large enough to

outweigh the gain from a single period defection the collusive outcome is
sustainable.

In order for the equilibrium strategies to be sequentially rational3,
however, it must be the case that if a defection actually occurs the non—
defecting firms are willing to mete out the proposed punishment. One way to

ensure this is for firms that defect from the punishment to be punished in turn,
and

so on. Rules which lead to optimal outcomes for the firms are provided by

Abreu(1982). A simpler way to ensure sequential rationality and the one usually
employed (see Green and Porter (1984), for example) is for punishments to Cnvolve
playing the equilibrium strategies from the one—period game for some fixed period

of time. In the sequel we restrict attention to strategies of this kind. As ye
will see shortly, in addition to their simplicity and conformity with the
literature they are also optimal punishments when price is the strategic
variable.

lower demand. Ye illustrate this phenomenon for both prices as well as for

Accordingly the game at time t is essentially a one—shot game in which the unique

equilibrium has all firms setting Pc. In what follows we concentrate instead on

the equilibria that are optimal for the firms in the industry.
We begin by examining joint profit—maximization and the benefits to

unilateral defections from it. Define rf(Q(e),e)

where K1(t) is the punishment inflicted on firm i in the future if it deviates
at time t.

The value of K±(s) depends on both the expected level of

future

profits if

there is no deflation at time t and on the nature of the punishment. Since we
want to concern ourselves with equilibrium strategies that are optimal for the

oligopoly and hence are interested in maintaining profits that are as large as
possible, we concentrate on punishments that are as large as possible; namely

those that have Pc for all t following a defection. While infinite punishment
periods are extreme they are subgaxne perfect and need not actually be implemented

in equilibrium. If the industry members change over time, however, infinite
length punishments are not compelling. To moderate the effect of this assumption

in the calculation of specific examples, we use reduced levels of the discount

rate, 8.
Suppose that the level of firm profits that can be sustained in a period

that the monopoly outcome is not the only solution in

then for large enough punishments there is never any incentive to cheat. The LHS

as

inversely

in Stigler's model (1964) the degree of implicit collusion varies

with N.

As & decreases so that the future becomes less important, the equilibrium

value of K decreases and hence the sustainable level of profits and the set of
states in which monopoly profits are sustainable also shrinks.
As was mentioned above, punishments are never observed in eauilibrium. Thus

the oligopoly doesn't fluctuate between periods of cooperation and noncooperation
as

in the models of Green and Porter (1984) and Porter (1983b). This arises

because

of the complete observability of Ct. To provide an analagous model to

those just mentioned, we would have to further restrict the strategy space so
that the oligopoly can choose only between the joint monopoly price and the

12

competitive price. Such a restriction is intuitively appealing since the
resulting strategies are much simpler and less delicate. With this restriction
on

strategies the firras know

be

maintained. They therefore assume that the competitive outcome will emerge,

which is

that when demand is high the monopoly outcome cannot

oligopoly will earn lower

profits than

under the optimal scheme we have analyzed.

As a result, since punishments are lower, there will be fewer collusive states
than before. There

will still be some cutoff, e, that

delineates

the

cooperative and noncooperative regions. In contrast to the optimal model,

however, the graph of price as a function of state will exhibit a sharp decline

after

with P

c thereafter.

The above models impose no restrictions on the demand function except that
it be downward sloping and that demand shocks move it outwards. However the

model does assume constant marginal costs. The case of increasing marginal cost

is more complex than that of constant marginal costs for three reasons: (i) A
firm that cheats by price—cutting does not always want to supply the industry

demand at the price it is charging. Specifically, it would never supply an
output at which its marginal cost exceeded the price. So whereas before cheating

i.e., the sustainable profit varies by state (in
contrast to the marginal cost case). (3) With increasing marginal cost cheating
can occur by raising as well as by lowering prices. If its opponents are

A

few results can nonetheless be demonstrated. First suppose that

deviating

firms do not meet all of demand. Instead the output which equates the monopoly

price to their marginal cost is less than demand. this occurs when N is large
and

o(q) where c' is

is thus smaller, ensuring that deviations become more tempting as Ct rises.

However, in this case, if the oligopoly keeps its price constant in response to
the increase in the desire to deviate actually falls. This occurs because

when the price is constant the profits from deviating are constant. Instead,
since the oligopoly price exceeds marginal cost, an increase in s accompanied by
a constant price raises the profits from going along.

When deviating firma meet all of demand the analysis is zore difficult. For
this case we consider an example in which demand and marginal costs ate linear:

As before the price rises monotoni.oally to St and then falls. The majOr
difference here is that eventually the price begins to rise again. The
explanation for this is straightforward. For high values of

the equilibrium

value of P is such that a deviating firm would increase its output only until P

equals its marginal cost; it is not willing to supply all that is demanded at its
lower price. An improvement in demand from this level accompanied by a constant

price actually reduces the incentive to cheat. Thus the oligopoly can afford to
increase its prices somewhat.

is

now not true that

any increase in demand even with constant marginal costs leads to a bigger

incentive to deflate from the collusive level of output. However, we present
robust examples in which this is the case. We also show with an example that
increases in demand can, as before, lead monotonically to "more competitive"

underlies these business cycles is probably quite general we illustrate
it with a simple example. Ye consider a "real" two sector general

other is oligopolistic. There is also a competitive labor market.

Third, it is luite plausible that changes in financial variables

demand. For instance increases in the money stock might be associated

with lower interest rates and a higher demand

shown below, durable good industries appear to be more oligopolistic than
other industries. These shifts in demand form a large part of the

model also sheds light on some slightly unfashionable concepts

of Keynesian economics. One of the most pervasive facts about increases
in the money supply is that they are not accompanied by equiproportional

increases in prices. Prices appear to be sticky (of Rotemberg (1982)).
Suppose that, increases in St are correlated with increases in the money
supply. Then increases in output are correlated with increases in the
money supply. As long as increases in output raise the demand far real
money balances, increases in the money supply will be correlated with
increases in real money balances. Prices do not rise equipropor—

process can continue until almost all oligopolistic markets have lower

IV. SOME RELEVMJT FACTS

a) The folklore
The theory presented in section II runs counter to the industrial
organization folklore.

This folklore is best articulated in Scherer

(1980 p.208) who says: "Yet it is precisely when business conditions
really turn sour that price cutting runs

with high fixed costs". Our

attempt

most rampant among oligopolists

at finding the facts that

industries whose experience is presented as

and steel.

supporting

the folklore.

For rayon he cites a study by Narkha

(1952) which shows mainly that the nominal price of rayon fell during the
Great

Depression. Since broad price indices fell during this period this

is hardly proof of a price war. Rayon has since been replaced by other
plastics making it difficult to use postwar data to check whether any
real price cutting took place during postwar recessions. For steel

either cement or rayon in avoiding widespread price deterioration, even
when operating at less than 65% capacity between 1958 and 1962 (p. 210).

This leaves cement. Ye study the cyclical properties of real ceient
prices below. To do this we collected data on the average price of
portland cement from the Minerals Yearbook published by the Bureau of

Mines. We then compare this price with the Producer Price Index and the

price index of construction materials published by the Bureau of Labor

statistics. Regressions of the yearly rate of growth of real cement
prices on the contemporaneous rate of growth of OTU' are reported in Table

25

1.

The coefficient of the rate of growth of GUI is always meaningfully

negative. A 1% increase in the rate of growth of ON? leads to a 0.5—1.0%
fall in the price of cement. To test whether the coefficients are
significant

the regression equations must be quasi—differenced since

their Durbin—Yatson statistics are small. Indeed the coefficients are

all significantly different from zero at the five percent level. More
casually,

it

the real price of cement

rose in the recession year 1954 while

fell in the boom year 1955. similarly, it rose during the recession

year 1958 and fell in 1959.

These results show uniformly that the price of cement has a tendency
to move countercyclically as our theory predicts for an oligopoly. These

results are of course not conclusive. First, it might be argued that the
demand

for cement might be only

structural

weakly related to ON?. Without a

model, which is well beyond the scope of this paper, this

auestion cannot be completely settled. The rate of growth of the output

of the cement industry has a correlation of .69 with the rate of growth
of

ON? and of .77 with the rate of growth of construction

well known to be procyclical. However, these correlations are

sufficient to prove that

cement is "more procyclical" than the

tical sector included in GNP. Second our regressions do not include

all the variables one would expect to see in a reduced form. Thus the
effect of GNP might be proxying for an excluded variable like the
capacity

negative effect on the

price of cement. While this is indeed a

possibility it must be pointed out that capacity itself is an endogenous

variable which also responds to demand. It would thus be surprising if
enough

capacity were built in a boom to more than offset the increase in

b) Actual price wars
There have been two recent studies showing that some industries
alternate beetween cooperative and noncooperative behavior. The first is
due to Bresnahan (1981). Ne studies the automobile industry in 1954,
1955 and 1956.

concludes that the competitive model of pricing fits the 1955 data taken
by themselves while the collusive model fits the 1954 and 1956 data.
Those two years exhibited at be8t sluggish GNP growth. GNP fell. 1% in

1954 while it rose 2% in 1956. Instead 1955 was a genuine boom with GNP
growing 7%. Insofar as cartels can only sustain either competitive or
collusive outcomes, this is what our theory predicts. Indeed, in our
model, the competitive outcomes will be observed only in booms.
Porter (1983b) studies the railroad cartel which operated in the

1880s on the Chicago—New York route. He uses time series evidence (as
opposed to the cross section evidence of Bresnahan) to show that some

months were collusive while others were not. His theory which is
developed in Green and Porter (1984) is that the breakdowns from the
collusive output ought to occur in periods of unexpectedly low demand.
He finds no support for this theory from the residuals of his estimated
equations.

Instead, we will argue his results support out theory. Table

2 presents the relevant facts. The first three columns are taken

As can readily be seen from the table the three years in which the
most severe price wars occurred were 1881, 1884 and 1885. Those are also
the years in which rail shipments are the largest both in absolute terms

and relative to lake shipments. This

these

certainly does not suggest that

wars occurred in periods of depressed demand. However, shipments

may have been high only because the railroads were competing even though

demand was low. To analyze this possibility we report the values of two
natural determinants of demand.

The first is

the length of time

during

which the lakes were closed. The longer these lakes remained closed the
larger was the demand for rail transport. This is the only demand
variable included in Porter's study. The lakes were closed the longest

1884. The second natural deterainant of demand, total grain production,
readily explains the anomalous behaviour of 1883. This was also the year

in which the total grain production was the second lowest in the entire
period and in particular, was 12% lower than in 1884. This must have

depressed demand so much that, in spite of the lake closings, total
transport was low enough to warrant cooperation.

is that we use aggregate

in the Chicago region. The reason for this is that it is very difficult

to define the Chicago region. It clearly includes more than the state
of Illinois but less than our proxy. In any event the movements in total
production figures represent mostly movements in the production of the
grain belt which includes Illinois.
c)

Price—cost margins
One natural test of our theory

cutting

is whether there is substantial price

by oligopolists when demand is high.

What is difficult about

carrying out this test is that prices must be compared to marginal
and that

is

data

on marginal

costs

costs at the firm or even at the industry level

notoriously scarce. Traditionally researchers in Industrial

Organization have focused on price—cost margins which are given by sales

minus payroll and material costs divided by sales. This is a crude
approrimation to the Lerner Index which has the advantage of being easy

to compute. Indeed Scherer cites a number of studies which analyzed the
cyclical variability of these margins in different industries. These

studies have led to somewhat mixed conclusions. However Scherer
concludes on p.35?: "The weight of the available statistical evidence
suggests that

concentrated

industries do exhibit somewhat different

pricing propensities over tine than their atomistic counterparts. They
reduce

prices (and more importantly) price—cost margins by

response

less in

to a demand slump and increase them by less in the boom phase".

This does not fit well with the

folklore which would

predict that on

30

average prices would tend to fall more in recessions the more

concentrated is the industry. Our theory would explain these facts as

follows. It repiires that prices fall relative to marginal cost in
booms. This is consistent with rising price cost margins as long as some
of

the expenditure on labor is in fact a

fixed cost. this

follows: Suppose that price and marginal

there

cost

are

can be seen as

constant

and that

are some fired costs. Then if the labor costs include some fired

costs an increase in output will lower the importance of these fixed

thus raising price—cost margins. The key

costs

margins

is that

price—cost

rise by less in concentrated industries. So either the fixed

costs are less important in the concentrated industries, which seems a

priori unlikely, or the concentrated industries tend to reduce prices

relative

to marginal

cost.

We also study some independent evidence on margins. Thirds (1984)
reports correlations between employment and real product wages in various

two digit

industries. These real product wages are given by the average

hourly wage paid by the industry divided by the value added deflator for

the industry. They can
marginal

be interpreted as

a different crude

measure

of

cost over, prices. Their disadvantage over the traditional

price—cost
materials

margin is that, unlike the latter, they not only require that

be proportional to output but also that materials costs be

simply passed on as they would in a competitive industry with this cost

structure. On the other hand, their advantage over the traditional
measure

is that

they remain valid when some of the payroll expenditure is

a fixed cost as long as, at the margin, labor has a constant marginal

product. Moreover it turns out that if the marginal product of labor

31

actually

falls as employment rises our evidence provides even stronger

support for our theory.

The correlations reported by Burda for the real

product wage and

employment using detrended yearly data from 1947 to 1978 are reported in
Table 3

which also reports the average four firm concentration ratio for

two digit industry. This average is obtained by weighting each four

each

digit SIC code industry within a particular 2 digit SIC code industry by

its

sales in 1967. These weights were then applied to the 1967 four firia

concentration indices for each 4 digit SIC code industry obtained from

At first glance it is clear front the table that more concentrated
industries like motor vehicles and electrical machinery tend to have

positive

correlations while lees concentrated

industries like leather,

food and wood products tend to have negative correlations. Statistical
testing of this correlation with the concentration index is, however,

somewhat delicate. That is because our theory does not predict that an
industry

which is 5%

more concentrated than another will reduce prices

severely in a boom. On the contrary a fully fledged monopoly will

more

in fact highly concentrated once location in space or type is taken into

account. Nonetheless higher concentration indices are at least

indicators of a sinner number of

sample into relatively unconcentrated and relatively concentrated and
chose, somewhat arbitrarily, as the dividing line the median

of 35.4. This lies between food and nonelectrical

machinery. We can then construct the following 2X2 contingency table:

An alternative table can be obtained by neglecting the three
observations

whose correlations are effectively zero. These are sectors

22, 28 and 372—9. Their correlations are

at most equal in abeolute value

to a third of the next lowest correlation. Then the contingency table
has, instead of the values 7:3:3:7, the values 7:2:2:6.
It is now natural to test whether concentrated industries have the
same ratio of positive correlations to negative ones against the

alternative that this ratio is significantly higher. The x2 test

hypothesis of independence without focusing on our particular

alternative. It rejects the hypothesis of independence with 92%
confidence using the values of Table 4 and with 97% confidence using the

values 7:2:2:6. This test is, however, likely to be flawed for the small
sample we consider. Fisher's test would appear more appropiate since it

there

is thus a

concentrated

fair amount of evidence for the hypothesis that more

sectors are more likely to have positive correlations. We

interpret this by imagining a world in which technology is subject to
technological

progress at a constant rate and in which capital is

accumulated smoothly. The deviations of employment from its trend then

occur only in response to increased demand. Then if the firms behave
monopolistically the real product wage will tend to fall when demand

increases. The same will occur if the firms are competitive and the
marginal product of labor falls as employment rises. Particularly when
there are diminishing returns to labor the finding that the product wage
rises when employment rises suggests the widespread price cutting our
theory

implies.

There are alternative explanations for our findings, however. The

first is that the positive correlations are due to monopolistic pricing
in the face of increasing returns to labor in the short run. The
existence of such increasing retuns strike us as unlikely. When

production is curtailed this is usually done by temporary closings of
plants or reductions of hours worked. These reductions would always

start with the most inefficient plants and workers thus suggesting at
most constant returns to labor in the short run. The second alternative
explanation relies on technological shocks. These shocks can, in
principle

either increase or decrease the demand for labor by a

particular

sector. If they increase the demand and the sector faces an

upwards sloping labor supply function, employment and real wages can both

increase. The difficulty with this alternative explanation is that the

35

sectors

casual

with

positive correlations do not appear to be those which a

observer would characterize as having many technological shocks of

this type. In particular stone, clay and glass, printing and publishing
and rubber appear to be sectors with fair]j stagnant technologies. On the
other hand instruments and chemicals may well be among those whose

technolo- has been changing the fastest.

V. CONCLUSIONS

This paper basically consists of three parts. The first is a somewhat
novel theory of oligopolies in situations in which demand fluctuates.

The second is an analysis of the business cycles that such oligopolies

can induce, while the third is

a

study of the plausibility of the idea

that oligopolistic industries tend to behave more competitively in booms.
Since the data appear consistent With this

idea they conaitute

fairly

direct evidence in favor of both our theory of oligopoly and that of
business cycles. This suggests that both theories and their empirical
validation deserve to be extended.

The theory of oligopoly

imperfectly

might be extended to

include also

observable demand shifts, prices and outputs. This type of

imperfect observability is the main concern of Green and Porter (1984)
who study markets with no observable shifts in demand. The advantage of

introducing unobservable shifts in demand is that these can induce
reversions to punishing behavior even when all firms are acting

collusively.

A natural question to ask is whether reversions to

punishing behavior that result from unobservable shocks are more likely
when everybody expects the demand curve to have

observable shocks

in Porter (1983a) are hard to characterize. Adding the

complication

that both the length of the punishment period as well as the

price that triggers a reversion depend on observable demand is a

37

formidable

task.

In this paper we considered only business cycles which are due
to the tendency of oligopolists to act more competitively when

their products. An

alternative

and commonly held

is that business cycles are due to changes in aggregate demand which

do not get reflected in

nominal

wages. In that case a decrease in

aggregate demand raises real wages thereby reducing all outputs. In our
theory

of oligopoly, firms

This suggests that stabilization

of

On the other hand, the busine8s cycles discussed here do not

necessarily warrant stabilization policy. While models of real

business cycles merely feature ineffective stabilization policies
hers such policies might actually be harmfull. Booms occur because,
occasionally, demand shifts towards oligopolistic products. In these
periods the incentive to deviate from the collusive outcome is greatest
because the punishment will be felt in periods which, on average have
lower demand and hence lower profits. If instead future demand were also

known to be high, the threat of losing the monopoly profits in those good
periods might well be enough to induce the members of the oligopoly to
collude

now. So, if demand

for the goods produced by oligopolies were

they might collude always, leaving the economy in a permanent

recession.

10 Therefore the merits of stabilization policy hinge

crucially on whether business cycles are due to shifts in demand

38

unaccompanied by nominal rigidities or whether they are due to changeB in

aggregate demand accompanied by such rigidities. Disentangling the

nature of the shifts in the demand faced by oligolopies therefore seellia

tQ be a promising line of research.
Much work also remains to be done empirically validating our

model itself. In section iv

presented a variety of simple tests
capable of discriminating between the Industrial Organization folklore
we

and our theory. Since none of them favored the folklore it may well be

without empirical content. On the other hand, our theory desenee to be

tested more severely. First a more disagregated study of the cyclical
properties of price—cost margins seems warranted. Unfortunately, data on

valued added deflators does not appear to exist at a more disagregated
level so a different methodology will have to be employed. Second our

theory has strong implications for the behaviour of structural models of

specific industries. Th. study of such models ought to shed light on the
extent to which observable shifts in demand affect the degree of
collusion.

kIn an informal discussion, Kurz (1979) recognizes the link between
short—run profitability and the sustainability of collusive outcomes.
However, the relationship between profits, demand, and costs is not make

The latter represents the realization of the shock at t whereas the
former is the state beyond which monopoly becomes unsustainable.
can directly be interpreted as either a
61n this case an increase in
shift outwards in demand or a reduction in c, that part of marginal cost
which is independent of q. This results from the fact that the profit
functions depend on s only through (a+ st—c).
7The

relevant root is the one with the highest profits for the

oligopoly;
8The interoectoral pattern of output movements can be independent of the
sector which has a technological shock if (as seems unlikely) goods are

consumed in fixed proportions which depend on the level of utility only.
Otherwise "normal" substitution effects will make the expansion biggest
in the sector which has the most favorable technological shock.

en constructing these aggregate concentration indices we
systematically neglected the 4 digit SIC code industries which ended
in 99. These contain miscellaneous or "not classified elsewhere" items
whose concentration index does not measure market power in a relatiely
homogeneous market.

10For the examples in Figures 2 and 3 this occurs as long as 5>0.8 when
prize is the strategic variable or 8>0.25 when quantities are the
strategic variable.
