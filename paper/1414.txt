Empirical Tests of Alternative Models of International Growth
ABSTRACT

Recent changes in patterns of international trade and growth have

rekindled interest in the relationships among trade, growth, and the international distribution of income. Three alternative models can serve as a

theoretical foundation for an empirical analysis of these relationships. The
first is the standard Heckscher—Ohlin—Samuelson (Ho) trade model with equal

numbers of factors and

goods

and incomplete specialization. The second

model allows complete specialization and more goods than factors. The third
model posits short run capital immobility. Each of these models has quite
different implications for the determination of wage levels and growth
rates.

The conclusions that we draw from this research are rather mixed.
Each of the models perform well on certain criteria and poorly on others.

While the standard HO model clearly fails to satisfy certain cross—equation
constraints, national endowments are remarkably good predictors of the locus

of international production. There are, however, significant nonlinearities
in the relationship between factor allocations and national endowments. Such
nonlinearities are predicted by the uneven version of the HO model. At odds
with both of these models is our finding that lagged values of inputs provide

an important explanation of current factor demands. Such correlations are
suggested by the adjustment cost model.

I. Introduction
Recent changes in patterns of international trade and growth have
rekindled interest in the relationships among trade, growth, and the international distribution of income. Three alternative xa'dels can serve as a
theoretical foundation for an empirical analysis of these relationships. The
first is the standard Heckscher—Ohlin_Samuelson (Ho)

numbers

of

trade

ImDdel with equal

factors and goods and incomplete specialization. The second

model allows complete specialization and sore goods than factors. The third

model posits short run capital immobility. Each of these models has quite
different implications for the determination of wage levels and growth
rates.

The traditional even (nxn) HO model with incomplete specialization
predicts instantaneous factor price equalization and equivalent growth rates

of wages across countries. In contrast, altering the standard HO model to
permit specialization of production potentially eliminates factor price
equalization and allows growth rates of wages to differ, both in the short

and the long run. The third model, which assumes short

run costs to

—2—

adjusting capital intensity, predicts short run differences in the levels and

growth

rates of factor returns, but

long run equalization

of these

variables.

Because these three models can
sequences,

it is important to

make

an

have

very different policy con-

attempt to determine which

is the most

accurate approximation of the real world. Unfortunately, many observations

can be rationalized within the context of any one of these models, and it is
therefore difficult to determine which is the most accurate. Take, for
example, the data reported in Table 1 that show vast international differen-

ces in
these

wages. If the even HO model is taken as the maintained hypothesis, then

data iaist be

regarded to be wages averaged across skill groups. Wages

a given skill group are regarded to be the same in every country, and a
country that has a relatively low reported wage is interpreted only to have a
relatively large supply of low skilled workers. As a matter of fact, Krueger

within

(1968) shows that a surprisingly large amount of the differences in gross wage

rates can be accounted for by a bit of disaggregation.
On the other hand, If the uneven HO model is taken as a guide, the
wage differences in Table 1 are suggestive of countries with factor endowment

vectors sufficiently different that they fall in different cones of specialization;

in this case the increasing similarity of wages over time is regarded

as evidence either of increasing similarity of factor endowments or as evidence
of the blurring of the differences among the specialization cones associated,

for example, with product price changes. These wage data can also be rationalized within the context of the third model ——the even HO model with adjustment

is

thought to be a

consequence of increased domestic factor mobility over time.
Although the wage data can be rationalized within the framework

of

any one of these models, each model has very different implications con-

cerning policies to raise wages in low wage countries. In the even HO model
the route to increased wages is increased training or, more generally,

increased human capital. Physical capital deepening can have no effect on
wages of a specific skill group because the accumulation of physical capital
leads only to an adjustment of the output mix and no change in capital

per man within a given industry. For the uneven model, on the other hand,
accumulation of physical capital can move a country from one cone of specialization to another, and can raise wages paid to each of the skill groups.
Policies to promote wage increases Implied by the third model (the even model

with

adjustment costs) aim at reducing the effective adjustment costs including

policies that alter the path of net foreign Investment.
The paper proceeds in the next three sections by briefly describing
each of the models, pointing out In the process their different testable

implications. Section IV describes the data used to test the three models
and some of its main features. Section V presents regressions of value
added, factor demands, and factor returns on country specific as well as

industry specific inputs. These regressions permit more formal tests of the
three models. The final section summarizes the findings and suggests additional areas of research.

both of these models is our finding that lagged values of inputs provide

an important explanation of current factor demands. Such correlations are
suggested by the adjustment cost model.

The inability to clearly discriminate among the three models leaves

open the issue of long as well as short run wage equalization. The partial
support for each of the models offered here suggests that an uneven HO model
with adjustment costs provides a better basis for discussing international
trade than any of the three models on their own.

II. The Even Heckscher—Ohlin—Samuelson General Equilibrium Model
The traditional general equilibrium theory of production describes
a country- with a fixed endowment of a set of resources, facing commodity

prices that are completely determined in international markets. Competition
for scarce resources determines their allocation among industries and their

rates of remuneration. The notation which we will use to describe this model
is the following:

X =

vector

of outputs of in commodities

V =

vector

of endowments of n resources

—5—

p

=

vector

of prices of m commodities

=

vector

of factor rents of n resources

A = 11 x n mtrix of factor input coefficients with elements equal
to the amount of factor k used to produce one unit of commodity j
The factor input nmtrix, the vector of outputs, and

the

vector of

endowments necessarily satisfy the relationship
(1)

AX=V.

With a suitable list of assumptions, including identical linear homogeneous
production functions for all countries, equal numbers of commodities and
resources, and incomplete specialization, it can be shown that the mtrix A
is the same for all countries, and in particular is independent of V. Under

these conditions (1) umy be inverted to obtain
(2)

X = A1V

which expresses outputs as linear functions of the endowments, with X and V
varying among countries, but A'1 constant.
Equation (2) which flEPS factor endowments into commodities pro-

duced, also implicitly allocates the factors among the industries. The
amount of factor k used to produce

of commodity j is

the (k, j) element of the input—output nmtrix. Thus,
tor k to a particular industry is proportional

where Aki

the allocation of fac-

to output and can be described

by an equation which is linear in the factor endowments V. This equation can
be estimated by regressing factor allocation

data on factor endowment data.

To clarify this regression model, consider the system for the simple case of

and i denotes the country. Because of the

constancy across countries of output per n, X/L1 and capital per n,
in industry j, these three equations are proportional to each other.
Linearity and proportionality are two strong implications of the even HO

model. In addition, the assumption of costless interindustry factor mobility
rules out any- influence of past history-. However, higher order functions of

national endowments, lagged values of national endowments, and lagged values
of factor allocations do influence current factor allocations in the uneven

The equations in 4) and (5) indicate that factor payments as well as value

the 6 equations in (3), (14), and (5) Is proportional to the others.

EstimatiOn of the factor payments and value added relations may be
less subject to bias from measurement error than estimation of factor

demands. Consider, for example, labor effort, which is ideally measured as
total effective hours worked, but in our data is proxied by total employment.

Assume that effective hours worked, Lij and employment, Lij differ by a
country specific factor A1, i.e., L1 =

A

L1 and Li

=

L. The term A1

may reflect cross country differences in hours worked per employee, the
intensity of work effort, or the effectiveness of work effort due to training

and ability. It is likely that

and A1 are positively correlated because

larger countries, with several notable exceptions, have higher per capita
income; the workers in these countries are typically better educated and

better trained. If this description of the relationship between effective
hours and employment is correct, the use of L. rather than

introduce complex biases in estimating (3). These biases will contaminate
tests of the cross equation restrictions in (3), although the estimated

of the L1 regression are likely to remain high if the B2 from the unbiased

regressions are also large.

equals true

since factor payments to

labor are for effective hours worked, rather than payments for simply-

coming

to work. In addition, wL1 in (14) can be replaced by E. total national labor
earnings, thus eliminating the problem of Inismeasuring total national labor

input. A straightforward test of the constant proportionality properties of

this model that do not involve iasurement of the labor input is to determine
whether the ratios

Eij/Kj E/R1 and Eu/Vu are roughly- constant across

all countries i. This is equivalent to asking whether profit rates and
factor shares are equal across industry.

III. The Uneven Heckscher—Ohlin General Equilibrium Model
The simplest uneven model has xrany

goods and two factors. A

possible equilibrium of such a model has countries with sufficiently different factor supplies producing different subsets of the commodities and

having different factor returns. Roughly speaking, the relatively capital
abundant countries produce the relatively capital intensive commodities and

have the higher wage rates and the lower returns to capital. This is
illustrated in Figure 1 where the first panel contains the unit value iso—

quants and expansion paths of three commodities: automobiles, textiles, and
clothing. The second panel illustrates the levels of factor returns as a
function of capital per rrmn, and the third panel contains the corresponding
outputs per man.

In the first panel, there are two unit isocost lines, each of which

consistent with the production of two of the three commodities.

The

hypothetical endowments of three countries are also indicated in this figure.
The United States, which is capital abundant, has

and produ-

autos and textiles. Japan, which

is less well endowed in capital relative to labor has lower wage rates and

produces the two less capital intensive products —

textiles

and

clothing.

Korea, which is still less well endowed in capital, specializes in the least
capital intensive product (clothing) and has the very- lowest wages. Note
that although both the U.S. and Japan are producing textiles, the U.S. uses
the more capital intensive technique.
This figure provides a stylized picture of the situation in the

1950s and early 1960s. Figure 2 then represents the current situation

arid

differs from Figure 1 in two ways. First, both Japan and Korea have accumulated capital at a more rapid rate than the United States.

Japan has moved

into the same cone as the United States. Korea has moved into the cone where
both textiles and clothing are produced. The other change that is evident in
Figure 2 is that the spread in wages between the two cones of diversification

is less than in Figure 1. What accounts for this change is the shifts in the
world supply curves induced by- the rapid accumulation of capital in Japan and

Korea, and the consequent change in the relative prices of the three goods.
In Figure 2 it is assumed that the relative supply of textiles increased and
clothing decreased, and, consequently, the price of textiles fell, and the

price of clothing rose. This change is depicted in Figure 2 by a shift outward of the textile unit value isoquant and a shift inward of the clothing

Worldwide accumulation of capital has generally the same effect in
the even and the uneven model. Namely, supply curves of the relatively capi-

tal intensive commodities shift outward and, as is
Rybczynski

indicated by- the

theorem, supply curves of the labor intensive commodities shift

inward. This will lead to a fall in the relative price of capital intensive
products and a general rise in wage rates. In the uneven model, however,
wage rates of the most capital abundant countries will

curves

fall

if the supply

of the most capital intensive products shift outward less than the

next most capital intensive products. In terms of our stylized diagrams,
this occurs if the supply of textiles increases more rapidly than the supply
of automobiles.

Evidence in support of the uneven model would be wage, employment,
or output data that conformed in a general sense to the second two panels of

Figure 1. Namely, wages depend on national endowments, and industry output and
employment are nonlinear functions of the national endowments. Since the output and employment functions are linear within cones of diversification a
theoretically appealing data analysis would estimate linear models based on
different subsets of the countries, possibly selected on the basis
larity in factor returns.

A word of caution is in order here about aggregation effects.

First it ny appear that wage rates increase with capital abundance only

because

earnings include a return to hun.n capital which naturally increases

along with

physical

capital. On the other band,

the

output and employment

function nay exhibit no clear nonlinearities because commodities with very
dissimilar factor requirements are combined in a single aggregate. The textiles aggregate, for example, include both capital and labor intensive pro-

ducts. Countries that are capital scarce produce the labor intensive
textiles and countries that are capital abundant produce the capital inten-

sive textiles. As a result, there is relatively little variation in output
of textiles overall associated with capital accumulation.

IV. A Generlized Heckscher-Ohlin Model of Economic Growth

with Adjustment

Costs
The key feature that differentiates the adjustment cost model
described here from the standard Heckscher—Ohlifl model of international trade

is the assumption that firms Incur costs for altering their level of capital

in any finite period of time. The adjustment cost techriolor we consider
expresses adjustment costs as an increasing function of the rate of invest-

ment (or disinvestment). Since the rate of investment depends on both the
absolute level of the firm's (industry's) existing capital stock as well as
the absolute level of new investment, a firm's Investment decision today will
affect its capital stock tomorrow and, therefore, its nrginal

adjustment

costs tomorrow. This formulation of the problem links the production and
investment decisions of the firm at one point in

time

to these decisions at

—12—

other points in time. Rather than equate the nrginal product of capital to
a common rental rate, as in the standard static

trade model, firms in this

environment alter their capital stocks over time to nximize the present
value of profits where profits are net of adjustment costs. The relative
immobility of physical capital does riot preclude perfect national and inter-

national mobility of financial capital. In addition, the standard trade
theory assumption of costless domestic,

interindustry labor mobility is nin—

tamed.
The assumption that altering levels of industry—specific capital is
costly in the short run has several important

implications. First, wage

rates will differ across countries in the short run despite the fact that
countries have identical technologies, are

incompletely specialized in pro-

duction, and financial capital is internationally mobile.

The world relative

price of the two commodities is not sufficient here to determine wage rates.
In the short run marginal revenue products of labor are equated across
domestic industries, but marginal revenue products of capital are not. It is
the satisfaction of both of these sets of

Conditions plus the assumption of

identical constant returns to scale technologies that leads to factor price

equalization. However, both conditions are satisfied in the long run when
the economy has Converged to a steady state

characterized by- incomplete spe-

cialization. Hence, if the economy converges to such a steady state, wage
rates across different countries must converge as well.
A second feature of this model is that positive investment iray take
place even in those industries exhibiting low

marginal revenue products of

—13—

capital. The reason is simply that

concentrating substantial levels of new

investment in any given industry or set of industries within any year entails
increasing adjustment costs; this will prove

unprofitable relative to

investing in low marginal revenue product, but low marginal adjustment cost
industries.

Even if disinvestment occurs, the rate of disinvestment will be
slow, again because of the assumption

of increasing costs to that activity.

A consequence of this is that specialization

in production will occur gra-

dually if at all.

The supply relationships of this model are derived by noting that
firms maximize the present value of profits.

intermediate investment data were imputed with straight line interpolation

methods. As a consequence of these imputation schemes, we are not altogether
comfortable with the econometric analysis that follows, since it
inappropriately ignores the possibility of gross or chronic measurement
errors in the data.

Features of our data set are reported in Tables 2, 3, 14, and 5.
The first four columns of Table 2 contain the total number of workers in each
of the industries in each of the years, and the share of these industries'
workers In the total world 'work force included in our data. Over this period

of time there was a fifteen percent increase in employment in these
industries, but the composition of world employment across industries did not

change such. The one n.jor exception to this statement is that employment In
textiles dropped substantially, both as a share of total employment and in

absolute numbers. Iron and steel experienced less extreme employment declines. On the other side of the ledger, plastics had very substantial growth,
as

did nEchinery.

The last

six columns of Table 2 contain the shares of the

industrial employment located in each of the three regions: the U.S., other

developed countries, and the rest of the world. The list of other

developed

countries includes the eleven countries with the highest overall capital per

The "World" refers to these twenty—seven countries plus the U.S.

expense of the other developed (OEcD) countries.

There were very substantial

increases in the employment share of the "rest of the world" in tobacco, and
the more labor intensive products:
share generally- fell for these

textiles, apparel, and footwear. The U.S.

industries, though textiles is an interesting

exception.

As indicated in Table 3 the industrial distribution of world labor
earnings also remained remarkably- constant

1978. Though the U.S. share of total
(Table 2), the U.S. share of

over the 15 year period 1963 through

employment rose roughly from .25 to .29

total earnings fell substantially from .60 to .141.

In fact, the U.S. share of total world

industrial earnings has fallen in every
industry which reflects the faster growth rate of wages over
the 15 year period
in the rest of the world relative to

the U.S. Developed countries other than

the U.S. account for most of the gain in the non—U.S. world earnings share
despite their decline in employment shares documented in Table 2. These data

thus conform to the data in Table 1 in the sense of revealing much faster
wage
growth rate in these countries relative to the U.S. and less developed
countries.

The data in Table 14 indicate little change over time in the

industrial composition of world output just as the previous tables reveal

slight changes in employment and earnings. In food, textiles, and apparel
there is more than a 1 percentage point drop over the 114 year period in the

share of world output. Industries whose output share rose by over 1 percentage
point are industrial chemicals, petroleum

refining, plastics, and machinery.

The capital data summarized in Table

5

indicate

that there are great

differences in the capital intensity of production in the three regions data,
both overall and at the industry level.
current U.S. production techniques

These suggest that in a few industries

nay be less capital intensive than those in

the other developed countries (tobacco,
leum and coal production, non—metal

furniture, petroleum refining, petro-

manufactured products, and iron and steel).

While the high rates of investment in many- of the countries in the developed
country- aggregate is well documented, it is

surprising that the U.S. advan-

tage in capital per worker may have been eroded in many industries as early-

as 1978. There are, on the other hand, 12 industries out of the 28 for which
measured 1978 U.s. capital intensity is sore than one third larger than that

in the other developed industries. These

industries are food, textiles,

wood, printing, industrial chemicals, other chemicals, rubber products,
plastics, metal products, machinery, professional goods, and other

industries. These capital intensity figures niist be viewed with great skepticism because of the unknown quality of the

available investment data and its

intermittent nature, and also because of the capital depreciation method which

is used. In particular: (1) investment occuring before 1963 does not contribute to the measured 1978 capital

stock, (2) the depreciation rate is taken to

be the same in all countries, (3) nominal

exchange rates are used to convert

foreign investment expenditures into dollar units.
With these caveats in mind it is interesting to note that the
measured share of output in the U.S. (Table 14) exceeds the measured share of

both capital and labor. One may suspect that the proper inclusion of pre—1963
investment would raise the U.S. share considerably.

The sixnhlaritiea in relative capital intensities by- industry

among

the three country- groups is ren.rkably high, particularly given the great differences in these numbers across country groups. For each region, petroleum

refining,

beverages, petroleum and

coal

products, and industrial chemicals rank

among the top industries in terms of capital intensity. The

ficients between

correlation coef-

industrial capital intensities are .89 for the U.S. and the

other developed countries, .96 for the U.S. and the less developed countries,

and .8T for the other developed and the less developed countries. There are

also several anamolies. Tobacco has a quite high ratio of capital to labor in
the U.S. and a quite low ratio in the less developed country group. A second
example is the apparel industry; while the U.S. capital labor ratio is 2.6
times that of the less developed countries, it is only .2 times greater in
apparel.

Assuming Table 5's capital intensity figures are fairly accurate

measures, the table provides strong evidence against the even HO model. The
similarity in relative capital intensities across industries suggests,
however, that systematic measurement error, in particular in the measurement
of human capital, could account for much of the disparity between the

services. Similar evidence casting doubt on the even HO model appears
in Table 6, which presents correlation coefficients between each country's
capital per worker and its industry—specific capital per man, value added per

man, and earnings per man. While the even HO model predicts zero correlation
coefficients between these variables, 15 of the 8 coefficients exceed .5 and
33 exceed .8.

VI. Regression Analysis
Table 7 reports industry—specific cross country results using 1978

data for four of the equations described in (3), (1) and (5). The four
dependent variables are the industrial employment of capital and labor, factor

payments to labor, and output. The explanatory variables are country
endowments of capital, high, medium, and low skilled labor (Labor 1, Labor 2,
and Labor 3, respectively), and land. Learner (1983) describes the construc—

tion of these variables. National endowments are strikingly sIgnificant
explanatory variables in each of the four regressions for each of the 28

industries. All but 2 of the 112 R2 equal or exceed .8; 8r equal or exceed

.95. The large R2s may, however, simply reflect scale effects. Table 8 presents these R2s as well as R2s adjusted for scale effects. The adjusted B2

computed here are one minus the ratio of the error sum of squares of the
Table 7 regression to the error sum of squares resulting from regressions

including only national capital endowment as an explanatory variable. Hence
the adjusted R2s represent the fraction of the variance of the dependent
variable explained by national endowments after controlling for scale

effects. These scale adjusted R2s are also quite large; 81 of these 112 R2s
equal or exceed .5, and 9l exceed .li.

The coefficients in the rows labelled Capital, Labor 1, Labor 2,
Labor 3, and Land indicate the impact on the various depend variables of

raising these national endowments by specific amounts. As described above the
even HO nde1 predicts that the coefficients of each of the four regressions
of Table 7 have the same sign. In addition the ratio of any two coefficients

in any of the four industry regressions should equal the ratios of the
corresponding coefficients of the same exogenous variables in each of the

other three industry regressions. These predictions of the even HO ndel are
sustained by many of the findings in Table 7.

Consider, for example, the 28

pairs of capital and labor demand regressions. Of the l1O (28 x 5) pairs of
coefficients, only 2 pairs are opposite in sign, and only i1 of these pairs
of coefficients that violate the prediction about equal sign have corresponding pairs of t values that are each greater than one in absolute value.
In addition there are seven industries, non—ferrous

metals, food, beverages,

tobacco, apparel, leather, and other chemicals in which each of the pairs of

capital and labor coefficients agree in sign. Note that the probability of 5
equal sign coefficient pairs is 1/32 assuming an equal independent probabi-

lity of each coefficient being positive or negative. In this case, the
expected number of regressions with identical coefficient pairs in 28 trials
is .875, well below the 7 actually observed.

The regressions of factor payments and

output

are potentially less

plagued by systematic measurement error. Of the ])O pairs of coefficients in
these two regressions only 25 exhibit opposite signs, and only 13 of these

coefficient pairs have t values greater than one. 13 of the 28 pairs of ear—
flings and output regressions have pairs of coefficients each of which agree in
sign.

As indicated, tests of proportionality of the four regressions

may-

fail due to mismeasurernent of both the endogenous and right hand side

variables. The nature of this mismeasure is, however, likely to be roughly

two sets of

results;

the method of estimating industry--.

stocks as well as national endowments is quite similar for

the two periods. As a consequence, differences in estimated coefficients
across the two periods may provide more reliable evidence of changes in
underlying production technologies and/or world relative commodity prices,
either of which would alter the coefficients in

(3), (14) or (5). Table 9

presents labor input and earnings regressions using 1963 data.

A comparison

of the estimated coefficients of this table with those for the corresponding
1918 regressions suggests substantial changes in technologies or relative
prices across the two periods.

While the regression findings of Tables 7 through 9 are broadly
supportive of the even HO model, tests to distinguish between the even and
uneven HO model provide strong support for the uneven version. The uneven HO
model suggests factor price equalization among countries with similar rela—

tive factor endowments. This implies that subgroups of countries with similar relative endowments will satisfy equation (3), (iL), and (5) for a given

set of coefficients. As one shifts from one subgroup to another, however,
the predicted coefficients will change.
Table 10 reports tests of structural differences in coefficients in
the factor demands, output, and earnings regressions, where the sample of
countries was split between the 15 countries with the largest and the 12 with

the smallest 1918 capital—labor ratios. The table provides both F statistics
testing for structural differences as well as the posterior probabilities of

structural breaks. The posterior probability is calculated using a prior

probability that is diffuse with respect to coefficient values and

specifies

a

50 percent chance that there is a structural break (see Learner (19T8),
chapter Ii). The posterior probability is computed as 6/1—6, where 6 Is given

ESSD+ESS

and T is the number of observations, K Is the number of parameter restrictions, ESS

is

the- error sum of squares in the

regression including the entire

sample, and ESSD and ESSU are the respective error sums of squares from the
separate regressions for the high and low

capital intensity country samples.

Holding the sample size and parameter restrictions

constant, the posterior

probability of structural differences is an increasing function of the calculated F statistic.

The critical F value at the 95

percent

confidence level is 2.T1.

Virtually all of the F statistics in Table 10 exceed this critical value;

many exceed 15. The corresponding posterior probabilities

of structural dif-

ferences are also very large. Over three quarters of these 112 probabilities
are essentially unity. With the exception of the wood industry, there is a
strong rejection of the structural equivalence of the two samples for at
least one of the four dependent variables.

The equally strong rejection of'

structural sixn±larities in the case of the earnings and labor input

regressions indicates that these tests are probably picking up more than differential measurement error.

The fact that significant structural differences are found for vir—

tually each industry suggests that

is a fairly good proxy for

capital per
countries lying in different
distinguishing
dividing

the sample based

on

of diversification. However, since there are 5 factors in our data Bet

rather than 2, there is no theoretical rationale to split the sample on the

basis of capital divided by the sum of the three types of workers. In a
multi—factor setting there appear to be no simple rules for segmenting the

sample. In the absence of a theoretical guide to splitting the sample, we
also tested for structural differences across countries by including higher

order terms in the regressions. More precisely, we added the squares of the
country's endowments as well as the cross products of the country's capital

and each of its three types of labor. Table 11 presents tests of the significance of these additional variables.

Like Table 10, the F values as well

as the posterior probabilities that the regression properly includes these
higher order terms are typically quite large.

They also constitute fairly

strong rejection of the linearity prediction of the even HO model.
Additional regression results are presented in Table 12 that also
contravene the even HO model, but that are

consistent with both the uneven HO

and the adjustment cost models. The dependent variable here is earnings

HO
per worker in a particular industry and country. According to the even
model, earnings per worker in an industry should be unrelated to a country's

endowment of capital per worker. In addition, given domestic labor mobility,
an assumption of all three models, industrial wages should be unrelated to
the capital in place in the particular industry.
The t values in column two of Table 12 quickly dismiss the notion
