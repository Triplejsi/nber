U.S. Defense Contracts During the Tax Expenditure Battles of the 1980s

NBER Working Paper No. 14146
June 2008
JEL No. H25,H57
ABSTRACT
This paper considers the impact of the tax treatment of U.S. military contractors. Prior to the early
1980s, taxpayers were permitted to use the completed contract method of accounting to defer taxation
of profits earned on long term contracts. Legislation passed in 1982, 1986 and 1987 required that
at least 70 percent of the profits earned on long-term contracts be taxed as accrued, thereby significantly
reducing the tax benefits associated with long term contracting. Comparing contracts that were ineligible
for the tax benefits associated with long term contracting with those that were eligible, it appears that
between 1981 and 1989 the duration of U.S. Department of Defense contracts shortened by an average
of between one and 3.5 months, or somewhere between 6 and 29 percent of average contract length.
This pattern suggests that the tax benefits associated with long term contracts promoted artificial contract
lengthening prior to passage of the 1986 Act. The evidence is consistent with a behavioral model
in which the Department of Defense ignores the federal income tax consequences of its procurement
actions, thereby indirectly rewarding contractors who are able to benefit from tax expenditures of various
types.

Introduction.
The United States government taxes the incomes earned by individuals and corporations,

but the tax laws occasionally provide for favorable deviations from strict income taxation, these
deviations being loosely grouped in the category of “tax expenditures.” Tax expenditure
provisions commonly reduce tax obligations associated with the production and sale of goods
and services, the benefits of which are ultimately shared between producers, who enjoy greater
after-tax profits, and consumers, who benefit from lower prices.
U.S. federal and state governments are major consumers of goods and services, including,
in many cases, goods and services whose prices are affected by applicable federal tax provisions.
It frequently happens that one part of the federal government offers tax subsidies to firms whose
output is purchased by another part of the federal government. In this setting, it is not difficult to
imagine outcomes in which the procurement arm of the government responds to lower prices by
increasing its consumption of subsidized goods and services, unmindful of the fact that their low
prices are due to benefits for which another part of the government pays. There remains the
question of how important a phenomenon this tax-induced procurement substitution may be, and
how it can be distinguished from other aspects of government purchasing decisions.
This paper considers the impact of tax changes in 1982, 1986 and 1987 that reduced the
benefits associated with long-term contracting. These benefits arise when a low- or zero-tax
entity (such as the government) purchases certain goods or services from high-tax providers
using contracts that extend beyond a taxable year. Under the “completed contract” method of
accounting, the income earned on such contracts is not taxed until the final year of the contract.
The availability of this method of accounting was reduced starting in 1982, and as a result, it

appears that the U.S. Department of Defense significantly reduced its procurement of goods and
services eligible for income tax deferral.
Firms providing goods and services under long term contracts often find that their
ultimate revenue stream is uncertain, as production encounters unforeseen costs or obstacles, and
mismatches with buyer expectations require that final product be modified subsequent to
delivery. Hence, a firm might appear profitable in the early years of a long-term contract, as the
buyer pays for partial completion, but upon concluding the contract the firm might find that it
has taken a significant loss. Given these uncertainties, Congress prior to 1982 was unwilling to
require taxpayers to include contracting profits in income prior to contract completion and
acceptance. Taxpayers electing to account for profits under the completed contract method of
accounting did not include contract income, and buyers did not deduct contract payments, until
contracts were complete. Since contracts are generally profitable, the tax deferral available from
use of the completed contract method of accounting effectively subsidized long-term contracts
whenever those performing the contracts were subject to tax rates lower than or equal to the tax
rates of buyers. This included most importantly cases in which taxable entities performed
contract work for nonprofit organizations or the government, but was not limited to these
situations.1
The completed contract method of accounting was modified and its benefits significantly
curtailed in a series of legislative reforms in 1982, 1986, and 1987. These reforms were
motivated by a perception on the part of Congress that use of the completed contract method of
accounting excessively subsidized certain contractors, particularly those doing work for the U.S.
1

Tax rates may differ between buyers and contractors if they are subject to differing tax rates (for example, if one is
a corporation and the other a partnership, or if one of the parties has tax loss carryforwards), or if the tax treatment
of contract income and expenses differs between the parties. Contractors providing goods that buyers would have to
capitalize and depreciate for tax purposes are examples of the latter.
2

Department of Defense (U.S. Congress, Joint Committee on Taxation, 1987). In the wake of the
generous tax provisions of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, subsequent legislative
developments in the 1980s sought to reduce many of the tax expenditures in the Internal
Revenue Code, of which the completed contract method of accounting was thought to be one.
One of the notable features of the completed contract method of accounting is that the
primary beneficiaries of this accounting method were believed to be taxpayers working on
contracts for the U.S. Department of Defense. Since the U.S. federal government both
subsidized these contracts with favorable tax accounting and financed the contracts with direct
defense outlays, it is not entirely clear why the accounting method per se was considered to be a
subsidy. If all parties are rational, and if those issuing the contracts on behalf of the U.S.
government incorporate tax revenue losses due to favorable contract accounting, then the subsidy
available from using the completed contract method of accounting would be entirely recouped in
other contract terms, presumably in the form of lower prices paid on these contracts. If these
conditions hold, then there would be no reason to expect that reducing the favorable treatment of
long term contracts would be accompanied by changes other than higher prices for goods and
services provided under these contracts.
The contracts used for Department of Defense procurement reflect problems of hidden
and incomplete information that influence many contracting situations. The government seeks to
obtain the best value for its money in settings in which it cannot be certain just how costly it is
for private firms to provide it with goods and services, while the providers, who may have better
information on their own costs, nevertheless face considerable uncertainty over what their
ultimate contract costs will be. In such settings even the most efficient contracts do not resolve
all of the associated problems of moral hazard and adverse selection (Cummins, 1997; Laffont
3

and Tirole, 1993; Rogerson, 1989, 1990, 1995), and in particular, there remains ample scope for
strategic manipulation of reported contract costs (Rogerson, 1992; Thomas and Tung, 1992,
Naegelen and Mougeot, 1998). In practice, there appears to be little evidence of strategic cost
shifting in defense contracts (McGowan and Vendrzyk, 2002), and the incompleteness of the
contracts that the Department of Defense signs with private contractors appears to reflect
efficient accommodation to the underlying design and performance uncertainties of modern
weapon systems (Crocker and Reynolds, 1993).
The scaling back of tax benefits associated with long term contracting is likely to
influence Department of Defense contracts in two ways. The first is that, for given contract
terms, providing goods and services under long term contracts becomes less attractive to
contractors, who will demand – and, in the course of the competitive process, get – higher pretax
prices. In response to these higher prices, the Department of Defense will reduce its demand for
goods with lengthy production processes.2 The second effect is that the loss of tax benefits from
long term contracts reduces the previous incentives to lengthen production processes in order to
take advantage of the completed contract accounting rules. Together, these two effects imply
that the Department of Defense faces higher procurement prices for goods and services produced
under long term contracts, and that average contract duration should shorten. These predictions
rely on the assumption that military contractors benefit from the completed contract method of
accounting; contractors that are tax exempt or otherwise face low tax rates should be largely
unaffected.
While it is difficult to compare prices of military contracts in separate years, given the
changing nature of goods and services demanded by the government, it is not difficult to
2

Lichtenberg (1989) estimates that the average price elasticity of demand for Department of Defense weapon
systems in the 1980s was 0.55.
4

compare contract lengths. This paper focuses on contracts entered into by the Department of
Defense in 1981 and 1989, finding that, after controlling for observable contract attributes,
contracts that were likely to be affected by the accounting changes in 1982, 1986 and 1987
shortened by 1.0-3.5 months compared to contracts that were not likely to be affected. Evaluated
at the mean, this corresponds to a 6-29 percent reduction in the contract length. This sensitivity
of contract provisions to the federal income tax treatment of contractors suggests that the
Department of Defense did not fully internalize its impact on federal tax revenues in making
contracting decisions.

2.

Legislative History: The Tax Expenditure Battles of the 1980s
Taxpayers with income earned from long term contracts are permitted choices among

alternative methods of accounting for their contract income and expenses. Long term contracts
consist of building, installation, construction, and manufacturing contracts that span more than a
single tax year. The types of manufacturing contracts that qualify for long-term status are further
limited to those for the manufacture of unique items (e.g. those not normally carried in the
contractor’s finished good inventories), or for items that require more than 12 months to
complete.
Prior to 1983, taxpayers with income derived from long-term contracts could choose
from the percentage of completion method, the completed contract method, or any of the other
more general accounting methods available for reporting contract income. Under the percentage
of completion method, costs derived from the contract are deducted in the period in which they
are incurred, while revenues are allocated over the life of the contract in proportion to the
percentage of completion of the good. In calculating the intertemporal allocation of contract
5

revenues, the percentage of completion calculations could be based on either the percentage of
cost incurred relative to total costs, or on the percent of physical completion of the good. In
contrast, under the completed contract method, revenue and costs that are directly allocable to
the contract are reported in the year the contract is completed, and costs that are not directly
allocable to the contract are deducted in the period in which they are incurred.3 Given the tax
significance of contract completion, there were conspicuous disputes and inconsistent rulings
between courts over the point at which expenses could be taken and contract income reported
(Yale Law Journal, 1955), as a result of which there was pressure on Congress to enact rules
clarifying and possibly limiting application of the completed contract method.
Congress’s first significant opportunity came in 1982, when reaction to the generous
provisions of the 1981 tax cut prompted new legislation designed to raise revenue and reduce
some of the perceived inequities in the tax system. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility
Act of 1982 modified the completed contract method to align its measurement of income more
closely with economic income attributable to long term contracts.4 In the case of extendedperiod long term contracts (long term contracts that last more than 24 months) some previously
defined period costs were reclassified as contract costs, thus requiring them to be carried forward
and accounted for at the time the contract is completed. These costs included, among others,
research and development expenses attributable to a long term contract in existence at the time
they are incurred, or which are incurred under an agreement to perform the research and
development. Contracts for construction with an expected duration of less than 36 months or
with contractors who have a maximum average gross annual income of $25,000 were exempt
3

Costs that are not directly allocable to the contract are often referred to as period costs. They are most naturally
thought of as overhead or common costs that cannot be specifically assigned to the activities of any one contract.

Regulations on the use of the percent of completion method were left entirely intact by the 1982 tax legislation.
6

from the cost reclassification regulations. These modifications took effect December 31, 1982,
with a phase-out of the deductibility of the newly classified contract costs over a three year
period.
Four years later, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 made sweeping changes to the U.S. federal
income tax, generally in the direction of drastically reducing tax expenditures (U.S. Government
Accountability Office, 2005), broadening the tax base, and lowering marginal tax rates.
Favorable accounting methods were swept up in these reforms, which included broad changes in
the use of the percentage of completion and completed contract accounting methods for reporting
income derived from long-term contracts. One year prior to passage of the Tax Reform Act of
1986, the U.S. Congress, Joint Committee on Taxation (1985) estimated that the annual tax
expenditure (foregone revenue) from use of the completed contract method of accounting would
be $4.9 billion in 1986, rising to $7.0 billion by 1990. These are sizable tax expenditures,
exceeding in magnitude the contemporaneous tax expenditures for the favorable tax treatment of
capital gains held by individuals until death. Changes to the percentage of completion method
reflected that “the Congress recognized the use of the percentage of completion method may
produce harsh results for taxpayers in some cases, for example, where an overall loss is
experienced on the contract, or where actual profits are significantly less than projected.”
Changes to the completed contract method resulted, on the other hand, came from a perception in
Congress that use of this method led to low or negative tax rates and an unjustified income
deferral (especially among large defense contractors).5
The revisions to the percentage of completion method enacted in 1986 removed the
option of calculating the percentage of completion based on physical completion. Furthermore,
5

U.S. Congress, Committee on Joint Taxation (1987).
7

the percentage of completion calculation now must be based on all costs for which capitalization
is required. A “look-back” adjustment to the tax liability of past years was also adopted. This
procedure was designed to account for circumstances where uncertainty in completion and
revenues might lead to unduly extreme tax outcomes over the life of the contract. Once the
contract has been completed and income and costs are known with certainty, taxes over the
course of the contract’s life are recalculated. Any discrepancies between the actual payment and
the ex-post calculations are then settled. This settlement allows the firm to receive a tax credit to
compensate for excess tax payments that may have arisen from calculations based on expected
income.
In name, the completed contract method is no longer an option for reporting long term
contract income. The completed contract method was replaced by the Percentage of
Completion-Capitalized Cost method (PCCC). In reality, the PCCC method is a hybrid of the
“old” completed contract method and the “new” percent of completion method. Under the
PCCC method, 40 percent of the contract income and costs were reported based on percentage of
completion.6 The remaining 60 percent of the contract income and costs were reported when the
contract is completed.7 Thus, only 60 percent of the taxable income from the contract could be
deferred until the contract is completed. The U.S. Congress, Joint Committee on Taxation
(1987) estimated that this accounting change alone would augment federal tax revenues by $2.9
billion in 1987, $3.3 billion in 1988, $2.3 billion in 1989, and less than $1 billion per year
thereafter. The Revenue Act of 1987 reduced the percentage eligible for deferral to 30 percent,

6

The “look-back” adjustment procedure is applied to this 40 percent of the contract income.
The PCCC method is to be applied to all contracts that are not accounted for using the straight percent of
completion method. Taxpayers who had previously used the more traditional methods, such as the accrual shipment
method, were also required to use the PCCC method for their long-term contracts.
8

7

so after 1987 at least 70 percent of contract income was taxed based on percentage of
completion.
The effect of the changes to the completed contract method on the incentive to
manipulate the contract length can be seen from the following example. Consider a firm with
$250,000 in profits from a one year contract. For simplicity, assume that contract revenue is
received and all costs are incurred on the first day of the contract. Under the “old” completed
contract method, the contractor could increase the present discounted value of his after tax
profits by approximately $5700 if he could artificially extend the contract length by one year.
(This assumes a marginal tax rate of 35 percent and a pretax interest rate of 10 percent.) Now,
under the PCCC method, the contractor only gains 30 percent of the original amount, or roughly
$1700, from extending the contract length under the new regime. With the percentage of
completion method, the contractor gains nothing from extending the contract.8

3.

A Model of Contract Timing
In evaluating the impact of contracting regimes on contract characteristics and

performance it is helpful to start with a simple framework that identifies the effects of
contracting rules on contract timing. This section offers one such framework.
Consider a Department of Defense procurement process that seeks to maximize the
present discounted value of national defense subject to a budget constraint. This problem is
characterized by the standard tradeoff (Peck and Scherer, 1962; Scherer, 1964; Hartley, 2007)
between procuring defense items sooner, when they are more valuable, or later, when they are
8

This example takes the nominal pretax interest rate to be 10 percent, but it is noteworthy that nominal interest rates
fell over the 1980s, further reducing the benefits of extending contract length for tax purposes. Annualized threemonth Treasury bill rates in mid-1981 exceeded 16 percent, and in early 1982 exceeded 12 percent, whereas by
1989 were well under nine percent.
9

less expensive. One way to express the contours of this tradeoff is to write the Department of
Defense objective function as:
W [x1φ (t1 ),..., x nφ (t n )] ,

(1)

for goods 1,…n, in which xi is the quantity of good i procured, and ti is the time to delivery of
good i. In expression (1), the φ (ti ) function converts units of xi to effective consumption based
on time to delivery, with φ ′(ti ) < 0 , reflecting that the military prefers to have its contracts
fulfilled sooner rather than later. In expression (1), the φ (ti ) function is taken to be same for all
goods i and quantity levels xi , though generalizing this to permit idiosyncratic differences
changes the results very little.
The Department of Defense maximizes (1) subject to the budget constraint:
n

(2)

∑ x p(t , α ) ≤ R ,
i

i

i =1

in which quantities are normalized so that the price of good i for immediate delivery, and in the
absence of special tax treatment, is unity. The term p (ti , α ) is the actual price of good i in the
marketplace, reflecting both time of delivery ti and the tax treatment of contract income, which
is summarized by the term α ; higher values of α are associated with greater tax benefits from
long term contract treatment. Hence the left side of (2) is the out of pocket cost of procurement
by the Department of Defense: it is the sum of the products of quantities and prices. The term R
on the right side of (2) is the Department’s available resources. It is noteworthy that, in this
formulation, the Department of Defense is assumed not to let the impact of α on federal
government tax revenues influence its procurement decisions. The impact of this assumption is
considered shortly.
10

Assuming that the Department of Defense can freely choose quantities and delivery times
for all n procurement items, interior conditions for the maximization of (1) subject to (2) are:
Wiφ (ti ) = λp (ti , α )

φ (ti )
p (ti , α )

(5)

Equation (5) is an elasticity condition. Welfare maximization entails the Department of Defense
trading delivery times against prices, to the point at which the price elasticity of good i with
respect to the timing of delivery equals the Department of Defense’s elasticity of valuation with
respect to timing.
In order to illustrate the effect of the tax treatment, α , on time to delivery, ti , consider a
standard discounting specification for φ (ti ) :
(6)

φ (ti ) = δβ −γt .
i

Differentiating (6) with respect to ti , it follows that (6) implies:
(7)

φ ′(t i )
= −γ ln β .
φ (t i )

Also, consider the following plausible specification for p (ti , α ) :
(8)

p (ti , α ) =

ζ (1 − αti )
ln ti

.

11

The p (ti , α ) function in (8) has the property that the price falls as ti lengthens, and higher values
of α are also associated with reduced prices, the effect of α on contract prices being greatest
for the longest term contracts. The function in (8) is sensible if contract time is measured in
years, so ti > 1 , and α is chosen so that αti < 1 for all feasible values of ti . Equation (8)
implies:
∂p (ti , α )

(9)

Equation (5) implies that defense contracts will be chosen so that the right side of
equation (7) equals the right side of equation (9). Since the right side of equation (7) is a
function of unchanging parameters, it follows that the value of the right side of equation (9)
cannot be affected as α changes. Differentiating the right side of (9) with respect to α , and
setting the result equal to zero, produces:

(11)

[

]

The numerator of the right side of equation (11) is positive, and the denominator will also be
positive either if α is very small or if ti < e and 1 ≥ 2αti . Hence there is a wide range of cases
for which contracts should be expected to lengthen as the tax treatment of contract length
becomes more favorable.

12

As noted earlier, these calculations presume that the Department of Defense ignores the
impact of its actions on federal income tax collections. If Congress in determining its budgetary
allocation to the Department of Defense treats the tax savings available to defense contractors as
equivalent to budgetary outlays, reducing resources available to the Department of Defense
accordingly, then price reductions for long term contracts due to higher values of α will not
entice greater purchases, as they come at the cost of reduced total resources. Hence contract
length sensitivity to the tax treatment of long term contracts suggests that the Department of
Defense does not incorporate tax considerations in its procurement decisions, presumably
because relevant decision makers do not have incentives to do so.

4.

Department of Defense Contracts

The data for the empirical analysis come from the Department of Defense Defense
Contract Action Data System, fiscal years 1981 and 1989. The data consist of all contracting
actions within the Department of Defense in excess of $10,000 in fiscal year 1981 and $25,000
in fiscal year 1989. These actions are reported on the DD Form 350, the Individual Contract
Action Report. The report gives information on the contracting office, action date, type of
contract action (e.g., cancellation or modification), the type of contract, contractor, type of good
or service, place of performance, weapon system that the contract belongs to (if relevant), the
expected completion date, and the contract value. Nominal dollar contract values were
converted to 1987 constant dollars using the aggregate price index for government purchases of
goods and services for national defense. In 1981 there were 374,804 contract actions totaling
over $119 billion as measured in 1987 dollars; in 1989 there were 222,597 actions worth over
$122 billion, again in 1987 dollars.
13

The study uses a subset of the full sample from 1981 and 1989. The sample is limited to
new contract awards that were negotiated by and for the Department of Defense in either 1981 or
1989. Because the data represent all contract actions, the selection criterion eliminates
modifications to existing contracts that can take the form of terminations, cancellations, increases
in the scope of work, and funding actions, as well as orders from contracts let by other Federal
agencies or other contracting offices within the Department of Defense. Contracts for sales to
foreign governments or international institutions were also dropped.9 The sample in 1989 was
further limited by the complication that the information on the expected completion date was
voluntarily supplied by the contracting office. Roughly half of the original sample of records
contain this information and the sample means for the observations with and without the
estimated completion date have similar values for other variables. Eliminating records with
identifiable reporting errors narrowed the final sample size to 165,160 observations, consisting of
121,993 contracts from 1981, and 43,167 contracts from 1989.10 Table 1 and table 2 present
summary statistics for the final combined sample and for the two yearly sub-samples,
respectively.

5.

Determinants of Contract Length

The sample means reported in Table 2 indicate that the mean length of a Department of
Defense contract in 1989 was roughly 1.2 months greater than the mean contract length in 1981.
This is a rather crude measure of contract length, however, since it does not control for
characteristics of the contracts that explain differences in mean lengths over the two years. For
9

The data are restricted to this subset for two reasons: to ensure that the types of contracts across the two years are
as consistent as possible (given the different end-use sources of the data and small differences in the DD Form 350),
and to improve the accuracy of matches between contracts and applicable tax regimes.
10
Identifiable errors include contracts with a negative calculated length and those with a dollar value less than zero.
14

example, contracts with larger dollar values tend to have longer duration, and since the (constant)
mean dollar value of defense contracts in 1989 exceeds that in 1981, it is sensible that contracts
might have lengthened. Consequently, the empirical investigation starts by estimating contract
length as a function of observable contract and contractor characteristics and a 1989 year
dummy. Because not all contracts were affected by the tax changes, the analysis is extended to
allow for a comparison of the difference in contract length over time between contracts that were
potentially affected by the accounting changes and contracts that were not. This analysis uses
three different classification schemes to identify changes to contracts: subject matter of the
contract, tax status of the firm, and the combination of subject matter and tax status.
The first column of Table 3 presents results based on the estimation of contract length (in
years) as a function of a 1989 year dummy variable and various characteristics of the contract
and contractor. The variables measuring contract and contractor characteristics are designed to
control for that portion of the contract length that can be explained by different mixes of these
characteristics over the two years. Such explanatory characteristics include the type of contract,
classified by the remuneration and, where relevant, incentive terms of the contract; the kind of
contract action, or the nature of the first binding document of the contract; the type of business or
contractor; the geographic place of performance; the subject matter of the contract, or the good
or service the contract covers; and the claimant group, or the broad procurement program the
contract is identified with (determined by the end use of the purchased item). Since contract
characteristics and contract length are jointly determined by the contracting parties, a regression
that estimates the effect of tax provisions on contract length while taking other contract terms to

15

be independent effectively estimates the extent to which parties are willing to exchange one
characteristic for another.11
The estimated constant term in column one of Table 3 indicates that the base contract – a
firm, fixed-price letter contract in 1981 with a large domestic firm for supplies produced in the
United States for use in the missiles and space systems program – has a mean length of one year.
The estimated coefficient on year 89 indicates that contracts let in 1989 were still 1.3 months
longer, on average, than those let in 1981, even with the inclusion of covariates to control for
contract characteristics that might affect the length. As previously noted, contract and contractor
characteristics contribute to sizeable differences defense contract lengths. The estimated
coefficients on the claimant group dummy variables indicate that contracts from the airframes
and aircraft engines claimant groups are 2.24 and 1.74 months longer respectively than contracts
from the base case claimant group of missiles and space systems. Contracts from all other
claimant groups are between 0.25 months and 8.75 months shorter than those in the missiles and
space systems claimant group, all else held equal. All other types of contracts are longer than
firm fixed price contracts, with fixed price incentive, cost plus-award fee, cost sharing, and cost
plus-incentive fee contracts contributing from ten to 12 months to average length. Contracts let
to small, non-profit, and foreign contractors are less than one month shorter on average than
contracts with large firms, all else equal. Service and research, development, test and evaluation
contracts are 0.6 months and 2.4 months longer than supply contracts, respectively, and each
additional billion dollars in contract value contributes 6.7 years to the contract length.

11

Estimated tax effects remain significant when contract dollar values and contract type variables are omitted from
the regressions.
16

Numerous factors other than tax changes influenced the duration of defense contracts
over this period. For instance, the decline in the total constant dollar value of Department of
Defense obligations after 1987 and the thawing of the cold war may have altered acquisition
policy in a way that systematically changed contract lengths between 1981 and 1989. Year 89
captures the unexplained time variation in all contracts, regardless of the cause. Therefore, the
estimated year 89 coefficient in the first column of Table 3 reflects the combined influence of all
of these factors, and not just the influence of the change in the tax treatment of defense contracts.
A more effective way to isolate the effect of the change in the taxation of long term
contracts is to identify a group of contracts that are potentially affected by the new regulations
via eligibility for the special tax treatment. The remaining contracts then represent a control
group that should not be influenced by the tax changes. It is then possible to estimate the effect
of the tax change on the affected group, adjusting for time and group effects, permitting the time
effect to vary between the control and treatment groups.
The tax changes of the 1980s present different possible groups with which to test the
effect of accounting methods on contracting behavior. Changes in allowable accounting
methods applied only to long term contracts, which are defined as building, installation,
construction and qualified manufacturing contracts that span more than one taxable year (since
firms have different tax calendars, contracts as short as one month can qualify). Consequently,
information on the subject matter of the contracts can be used to identify those contracts that are
potentially eligible for long-term contract treatment. This group of potentially tax sensitive
contracts includes contracts for: supply; research, development, test and evaluation; and a subset
of service and construction contracts concerning the installation of equipment, maintenance,
17

repair and rebuilding of equipment, construction of structures and facilities, maintenance, repair
or alteration of real property, and modification of equipment. The Appendix lists the
Department of Defense classification of service and construction contracts.
Column two of Table 3 presents coefficients from a regression estimating the treatment
effect of the tax change on the affected contracts. Figure 1 reproduces a subset of these
coefficients.

Contracts in both groups were longer on average in 1989 than in 1981, 0.106 and 0.173 years for
the contracts affected by the tax change and those unaffected, respectively. Contracts potentially
affected by the tax change showed a smaller increase, however: the difference is 0.067 years
(roughly 3.5 weeks), or 6.1 percent of mean contract length.

18

There is potential imprecision in the classification of the treatment group in this
regression, particularly in the case of service contracts. To address this issue, the regressions
were re-run using differing definitions of the treatment and control groups. Based on the listing
of broad service and construction contract groups in the appendix, the control group was changed
to include: research, development, test and evaluation contracts; maintenance, repair and
rebuilding of equipment contracts (8); and repair or alteration of real property contracts (23).
Also, contracts that deal with the construction-related work of architects and engineers (2) were
included in the treatment group. The sign of the estimated tax effect remained the same in all of
these regressions, with the estimated effect on contract duration varying from 0.027 to 0.126
years.
Information on the tax status of the contractor provides another way of identifying the
effect of tax changes on contract length. Domestic firms with taxable earnings from work
performed in the United States should be most sensitive to U.S. tax changes, whereas nonprofit
organizations, foreign firms, and domestic firms performing work outside the United States
should be the least sensitive.12 Hence, a second set of treatment and control groups can be
defined by tax sensitive and tax insensitive firms. Column three of Table 3 reports coefficient
estimates from a regression using this classification, and Figure 2 reports the selected subset.

12

Some foreign firms doing business in the United States are subject to taxation by their home countries, which
permit them to claim tax credits for income taxes paid to the United States. For these firms U.S. taxes are not
entirely costs, since they create offsetting credits, which explains patterns of investment in the United States
identified by Hines (1996). American firms doing business abroad are permitted to defer U.S. taxation of their
foreign income until it is repatriated to the United States, which reduces effective U.S. taxation of this income
(Hines, 1994; Desai, Foley and Hines, 2003).

Notes: Standard errors are in parentheses. The numbers under the

Again, the results indicate that all contracts increased in length from 1981 to 1989: 0.098 and
0.207 years for contracts with tax sensitive and tax-insensitive firms, respectively. This change
in contract length was, however, smaller by 0.109 years (roughly five weeks) for the treatment
group, representing a difference of 11.7 percent of mean contract length.
The underlying idea behind the estimates reported in Table 3 is that one group of
contracts is affected by the tax change and one is not, either by virtue of the tax status of the firm
or the type of good or service the contract covers. It is also possible to estimate interaction
effects to exploit both dimensions of applicability at the same time, which is what is done by the
equation presented in Table 4. These results are very similar to those reported in Table 3.
Various contract and contractor characteristics still contribute to sizeable differences in the
length of defense contracts. The coefficients on the claimant group dummy variables indicate
20

that contracts from the airframes and aircraft engines claimant groups are 2.25 and 1.75 months
longer respectively than contracts from the base case claimant group of missiles and space
systems. Contracts from all other claimant groups are 0.25 months to 8.75 months shorter than
those in the missiles and space systems claimant group, all else equal. All other types of
contracts are longer than firm fixed price, with fixed price incentive, cost plus-award fee, cost
sharing, and cost plus-incentive fee contracts contributing from 10.5 to 12.4 months more to the
length. Research, development, test and evaluation contracts are 2.5 months longer than supply
contracts and each additional billion dollars in contract value contributes 6.7 years to the contract
length.
Table 5 presents results from this estimation in a manner similar to that of Figure 1. The
top panel presents time-group effects, time variation within groups, group variation within a
period, and the tax treatment effect for taxable firms. Within this subset of firms that are
affected by the tax changes, all contracts increased in length between 1981 and 1989. This
contract lengthening was more pronounced for contracts unaffected by the tax change: the
difference between the change in treatment and control groups was 0.118 years, or roughly 1.4
months, 11.2 percent of mean contract length.
The middle panel of Table 5 presents analogous results for tax insensitive firms. This
panel illustrates the effect of unexplained influences on length for both types of contracts.
Because these firms were generally not affected by changes to contract accounting methods, the
variation in contract lengths within groups over time and across groups within a time period
presumably reflect factors other than those having to do with the taxation. All contracts
increased in length over the period, but more so for contracts that broadly could be classified as
sensitive to tax changes.
21

The bottom panel of Table 5 gives the estimated tax treatment effect when both the firm
tax status and contract subject matter dimensions are taken into account. Contracts for goods and
services subject to the accounting change, provided by firms with tax sensitive income,
shortened by 0.303 years between 1981 and 1989 compared to contracts unaffected by the tax
change with tax insensitive contractors. This difference of 0.303 years corresponds to 28.7
percent of mean contract length.
Only contracts for manufactured goods must exceed 12 months to qualify for long-term
status. All other eligible contracts will qualify if the contract spans more than one taxable year.
Hence, it is possible that contracts as short as 2 months might qualify for long-term status and
would be sensitive to the change in allowable accounting methods. Longer contracts are,
however, more likely than others to span taxable years, and longer contracts, with their greater
average dollar values, offer greater benefits from extensions into subsequent tax years. A final
set of regressions, presented in Table 6, explores the possibility that longer contracts are most
sensitive to the tax changes by estimating quantile regressions for the 50th, 75th and 90th
percentiles. A comparison of the results across quantiles indicates that the relationship between
contract length and the covariates is not constant for all points in the distribution of contract
length. Furthermore, a comparison of the results in Table 6 and the results in Table 4 indicates
that the estimated effect of the non-treatment related covariates on the mean are most similar to
the estimated effect of these same covariates in the 50 to 75 percentile range of contract length.
Table 7 reproduces the estimated treatment effects from Table 6. Columns one and two
of Table 7 present differences in time variation between eligible and ineligible groups of
contracts for taxable and tax-exempt firms, respectively. Column three presents the overall
difference between taxable and tax-exempt firms. The results reported in column one indicate
22

that, for all quantiles, contract lengths for eligible contracts increased less than contract lengths
for ineligible contracts. This finding suggests that contract lengths for eligible goods produced
by taxable firms are sensitive to the tax treatment of the contract. The results found in column
two indicate that contract lengths for eligible goods produced by tax insensitive firms actually
increased over time relative to non-eligible goods produced by the same type of firms. These
results are similar to the result from mean estimation presented in Table 5.
Finally, column three gives the estimated tax treatment effect when both the firm tax
status and the contract subject matter dimensions are taken into account. In both a relative and
absolute sense, contracts in the 90th percentile were more sensitive than contracts in the 50th or
75th percentile. Contracts in the 90th percentile decreased in length by 0.28 years or 15 percent,
while contracts in the 50th and 75th percentile decreased by 0.15 and 0.17 years or 20 and 13
percent, respectively.
The estimated conditional median contract length is 0.732 years. Therefore, a median
contract will qualify for long term status only if the contract spans two taxable years. Contracts
in the 75th percentile will automatically qualify with respect to length since the estimated
conditional length for the 75th percentile is 1.3 year. All qualified contracts (i.e., those that span
more than one tax year) should be affected by changes in the tax accounting rules, regardless of
absolute length. However, there is an additional element of gaming with shorter contracts that
expire near the end of a taxable year. Firms that extend the length of these contracts to span two
tax years will be able to take advantage of the tax deferral. This may explain the increased
sensitivity at the median, as a percent of the estimated conditional median, relative to the 75th
percentile.

Conclusion

The experience of the 1980s strongly suggests that Department of Defense contract
provisions are sensitive to their federal income tax treatment. In response to reductions in the
favorable tax treatment of long term contracts, average contract length fell by between slightly
less than one month to over 3.5 months, or 6-29 percent of mean contract length. From this
evidence it appears that the Department of Defense does not fully incorporate the effect of its
procurement decisions on federal income tax revenue, and as a result, consciously or
unconsciously encourages provision modes that benefit from favorable tax treatment.
The sizable tax expenditure associated with long term contracting prior to the 1980s
represented a significant subsidy to military procurement that was not captured in standard
budget entries for federal outlays. Whether it is better for the federal government to finance
programs through tax subsidies or direct budgetary outlays is an ages-old question, given new
life in recent decades by the work of Stanley Surrey (e.g., Surry, 1973) in promoting the tax
expenditure budget. More recent scholarship (e.g., Dharmapala, 1999; Weisbach and Nussim,
2004) offers mixed assessments of tax expenditures and outlay alternatives, noting the
advantages and disadvantages of each in different settings. There could be circumstances in
which outcomes are unaffected by whether the government uses tax expenditures or direct
outlays to finance its programs, and if ever there were to be such a case, it is likely to be one in
which the government itself is the ultimate consumer. Yet the evidence is that military
procurement is affected by the form that tax benefits take, very likely reflecting the decentralized
behavior of military agencies pursuing objectives without fully incorporating their effect on other
parts of the government. Hence as a practical matter tax expenditures and direct outlays are not
equivalent even from the standpoint of government procurement, and the failure of this
24

equivalence implies that there are real consequences to alternative methods of financing
government programs.
