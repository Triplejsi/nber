Lifting the Curse of Dimensionality: Measures of the Labor Legislation Climate in the States
During the Progressive Era

ABSTRACT
One of the most difficult problems in the social sciences is measuring the policy climate in societies.
Prior to the 1930s the vast majority of labor regulations in the U.S. were enacted at the state level.
In this paper we develop several summary measures of labor regulation that document the changes
in labor regulation across states and over time during the Progressive Era. The measures include an
Employer-Share-Weighted Index (ESWI) that weights regulations by the share of workers affected
and builds up the overall index from 17 categories of regulation; the number of pages of laws; appropriations
for spending on labor issues per worker; and two nonparametric COORDINATES that summarize
locations in a policy space. We describe the pluses and minuses of the measures, how strongly they
are correlated, and show the stories that they tell about the changes in labor regulation during the progressive
era. We then provide preliminary evidence on the extent to which the labor regulation measures are
associated with political and economic correlates identified as important in histories of industrial relations
and labor markets.

Lifting the Curse of Dimensionality: Measures of the Labor Legislation Climate
in the States During the Progressive Era
One of the most difficult problems in the social sciences arises when trying to develop
summary measures of the policy climate in societies. Government regulation, constitutions,
and legal structures are often messy and not easily quantified. In modern societies they often
involve thousands of pages of laws, court decisions, and administrative decisions within the
government, as well as in external assessments by politicians, lawyers, and scholars. Yet
summary measures that isolate the key components of the policy climate are necessary for
developing an understanding of how the measures were adopted and their impact on societies.
Over the past few decades, as statistical analysis has begun to play an increasing role in
the social sciences, scholars have developed a wide variety of quantitative measures of features
that do not lend themselves easily to measurement. For example, Jack Walker (1969)
developed an “innovation score” to describe the changes in state government policies before
1965 for 88 different programs.1 Poole and Rosenthal (1991, 1997, 2000) and Poole (2005)
use measures of legislative voting to develop “spatial coordinates” that describe the typical
positions in the public policy space of the U.S. Congress and the British Parliament.
Alternative measures of voting ideology have been created during the same era by Berry,
Ringquist, Fording, and Hanson (1998). Numerous scholars have found this work useful for
estimating the influences on policy and the influence of policy on social factors.2
Scholars and policy makers interested in the study of the importance of Democracy, the
extent of market economies, and the protection of individual freedoms have developed indices
like the Index of Economic Freedom, the Freedom House scores, and the rule-of-law. These

4

have been used by a large number of social scientists in analyzing the determinants of these
policies and their impact on economic growth and other measures of the success of society.3
Nearly every historian of labor relations and labor markets examines the role of
governments in determining (or not determining) rules for collective action, arbitration of
disagreements between workers and employers, and standards for the terms of employment.4
Whether the work is narrative or quantitative in nature, nearly all grapple with issues about
how best to describe the nature of government policies.5
To aid businesses, unions, and workers understanding of the labor regulation climate
during the Progressive Era, the U.S. Commissioner of Labor and then the Bureau of Labor
Statistics published volumes that described the text of all of the labor statutes on the books in
the states. In the 1930s John R. Commons and his Associates, in particular, Elizabeth
Brandeis, offered detailed assessments of these policies in their History of Labor in the United
States. 6 Having worked with these sources and the original statutes and studied many court
decisions in the course of studying workers’ compensation and other labor issues, we have seen
the great diversity and breadth in labor regulations. This diversity sometimes gets lost in the
analysis of labor legislation during the Progressive Era because most scholars have sought to
focus on specific policies, like workers’ compensation or child labor laws. Recognizing the
interactions of these laws with the broader regulatory climate is likely to be important,
however, because the broader setting likely influenced the adoption and impact of the specific
policies.
Our goal in working on this project has been to develop several summary measures of
the overall labor regulation climate at the state level during the Progressive Era. We offer
several different types of measures to try to capture different aspects of the regulatory climate

5

and to check the degree to which these measures are correlated with each other. The measures
are used to show the expansion of labor regulation both within and across states over the
course of the Progressive Era. We conclude with some preliminary analysis of political and
labor market correlates that influenced the spatial and geographic variation in the measures
over time.
Another goal of the project is to give more recognition to the extent of labor legislation
at the state level that existed before the federal involvement that arose during the New Deal.
Labor historians are well aware of the role played by the states in regulating labor markets in
the early 1900s. Based on our observations at conferences, many social scientists who study
the modern era are not. By creating measures of labor market regulation that can be
aggregated to the national level, we hope that the measures will cause such social scientists to
be aware of the extent of regulation in place before the national government got involved.

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Increasingly large numbers of workers entered the industrial sector between the end of
the Civil War and the 1920s. The adoption of new machinery and new methods of organizing
work led to an expansion in the size of workplaces. Workers who entered the workforce in the
1870s experienced dramatic changes in the nature of workplaces. Many started in agriculture
or in small hand manufacturing operations where there were strong personal relations between
the worker and the employer. As the decades passed, many ended up in larger operations with
more impersonal relationships.
Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of immigrants arrived and began working in the
mines and many of the leading industries. Many workers felt that they had lost a significant

6

degree of control over their work situation. They had less interaction with the owners of the
firm and their employment situation could be threatened by national and international market
forces over which even their employer had no control. A number of workers responded by
joining unions, including unions with broad coverage like the Knights of Labor in the late
1870s and the 1880s, and the more narrowly construed unions focused on their craft or
industry.
Another response was for workers to join with a wide range of social reform groups to
seek more state regulation of the workplace. Workers were not always opposed by employers
when they sought regulations. In fact, Fishback (1998), among others, has suggested that
progressive employers, often larger and more likely to be unionized, supported new regulations
that codified their own practices or cost them little to put in place. He argues that many of the
progressive era labor regulations were enacted when leading employers joined workers and
reformers in pushing for new regulation. One sign that this was likely to be true was the lack
of success of workers and reformers in their attempts to push for state health insurance and
unemployment insurance, two policies actively opposed by many large employers.7
Nearly all the regulatory activity during the Progressive Era took place in state
governments.8 As a result, the national regulatory environment often looked like a patchwork
quilt that was constantly being reworked. One reason was that some activities, like coal
mining, took place in half or fewer states. For more general regulations, like workers’
compensation, the political structure and the strength of interest groups in the economy varied
substantially from state to state, leading to differences in the timing of adoption of the laws.
The range of issues addressed was impressive. As seen in Table 1, many of the mining
states were early adopters of rudimentary mining regulations that called for the filing of maps

7

and provision of basic ventilation between 1869 and 1880. Simultaneously at the behest of the
nascent union movement many states established bureaus to collect labor statistics, often in the
form of surveys of workers. By the 1880s some states had began putting more teeth in the
regulations by providing for inspectors of boilers, factories, and mines.

When the inspectors

found violations, the state attorney general or prosecutors would then take the employer to
court to determine the extent of the defense and the fine to be paid. As the pressures for
collective bargaining arose in the late 1870s and 1880s, a number of states established
mediation, arbitration, and conciliatory bodies to aid in settling strikes (Currie and Ferrie
2000). The struggles between striking workers and employers carried into the legislature as
each side sought support from the state in establishing the rules for bargaining. Some states
passed laws that promoted unionization by outlawing “yellow dog” contracts and protecting
union trademarks and labels. On the other hand, other states seemed bent on limiting
unionization with the passage of anti-enticement laws and laws that limited picketing and were
specifically targeted at reducing intimidation of non-union workers. Meanwhile, a number of
professionals sought forms of occupational licensing that can be seen as attempts to control the
quality of service provided and/or to raise the incomes of the licensed professionals by limiting
entry.9
Various states legislated limits on wages and hours of male workers, although such
laws were so broadly written as to have little meaning or were struck down by the courts.
Limits established for child labor and women’s hours were more successful. Perceptions of
increased dangers associated with industrialization caused states to pass laws regulating
workplace safety and developing new rules for the compensation of injured workers.

8

Using the volumes published by the U.S. Commissioner of Labor (1896, 1904, 1908)
and later the Bureau of Labor Statistics (1914, 1925), Commons and Associates (1966), and the
annual or semiannual state reports on new statutes passed by the legislatures, Rebecca Holmes
(2003, 2005) accumulated a database that covers each year from 1900 through 1925 and
identifies which states had each of 135 different labor laws for her dissertation. In the course
of pursuing other projects, we have added information on the total number of pages devoted to
all labor laws in the states, and the extent of state legislature’s appropriations for spending on
the administration and enforcement of their labor laws. The goal of this paper is to use this
information to develop measures of the changing labor regulatory climate in the states during
the Progressive Era.
The presence of so many types of laws would have been considered a blessing to those
who succeeded in getting them passed. However, someone seeking to develop a broad picture
of the regulatory climate faces the curse of dimensionality. We seek to lift the curse by coming
up with a series of summary measures of the regulatory climate that allow for summary
comparisons both across states and time.
In a recent paper in a volume honoring Thomas Weiss, we began to lift the curse by
creating a series of indexes that involved a simple count of the laws, an index that reweighted
the laws by putting them into specific categories of laws and then summing across categories,
and then indices that weighted laws by the share of the workforce affected by the laws (see
Holmes, Fishback, and Allen 2008). We found that all of these measures were highly
correlated with each other. Cross-sectional correlations for the 48 states between the measures
were above 0.96 in 1919, 0.97 in 1909, and 0.96 in 1899. Correlations of the change over time

9

in the indices were above 0.89 for the change from 1899 to 1919, above 0.87 for the change
from 1899 to 1909, and above 0.89 for the change from 1909 to 1919.
The most conceptually appealing of the indices in that paper was the EmploymentShare-Weighted Index (ESWI). In the index we divided the laws into 17 categories and each
of the laws within the categories are weighted by the share of workers directly covered by the
law. In this way multiple laws dealing with the same issue are not given too much weight.
Nor were laws specific to a subset of the workforce given weight that exceeded their share of
the workforce.
In this paper we compare the ESWI with other measures of labor legislation, including
the number of pages devoted to labor laws, the state appropriations for administering and
enforcing the labor laws, and a pair of COORDINATE measures that use the information on
over 130 labor laws to examine how closely the labor laws of each state match each other. No
single measure fully captures the labor climate. Scholars will likely differ on how much
weight to give to each law in the ESWI. There are so many laws that a debate over weights
could be endless. Page numbers and labor spending provide alternative ways of measuring the
breadth and depth of the laws and enforcement and the COORDINATE measures offer an
alternative check that is largely derived from a data-mining exercise.
Our goal is to provide all of these measures and check their comparability to see if they
describe similar patterns over time and across states. We chose these measures because they
seemed a reasonable start. The complete set of data on the laws will be posted at Price
Fishback’s website in the medium run and eventually the ICPSR website, so that other scholars
can develop their own indices if they find the ones described in this paper do not meet their
research goals. Readers should recognize one caveat on the use of the information that will be

10

posted. Scholars focusing on a specific law or set of laws should see the information as a
starting point for their research. We have no illusions that we have captured all of the
subtleties of particular laws and careful reading of the laws to further refine the measures is
advised when analyzing each specific law.

CONSTRUCTING THE ESWI
The ESWI is constructed with the laws listed in Appendix Table 1 compiled from the
reports on “Labor Laws in the United States by the U.S. Commissioner of Labor (1896, 1904,
1908) and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (1914, 1925).10 The laws are divided into 17
categories: Workplace activity regulation, which includes specific regulations for factories,
mines, railroads, street railroads, and limits on occupational entry; Hours regulations for
women, children and some groups; Workplace activity regulation for women and children,
which are additional regulations of workplace activity specifically focused on women and
children and thus kept separate; Employer liability and workers’ compensation; Steam boiler
inspections; Unionization and Bargaining, which include positive values for laws that favored
unions and negative values for those making unionization more difficult; Laws that prohibit
bribery and coercion and protect political freedoms; the presence of a Department of Labor or
Bureau of Labor Statistics; the presence of a State Board of Arbitration, Mediation, or
Conciliation; the presence of a Rehabilitation Commission; the presence of an Industrial
Commission, which is kept separate from Departments of Labor because some commissions
had rule-making authority not given to labor departments; Free Employment Offices; AntiDiscrimination; Payday Regulations; Holiday Regulations; Minimum Wage Regulations; and
Miscellaneous Regulations.

11

Within each law category j we develop an Employment Share-Weighted Index (ESWI)
that is designed to sum to a maximum value of one for that category. We chose the value of
one as a maximum to avoid giving too much weight to a law that is just one of many in a
category like workplace activity. In this method the categories of laws are given equal weight.
A law within any category is weighted by the share of the nonagricultural workforce
covered by the law as of 1900. If the law deals only with miners, for example, it is therefore
given a much smaller weight than if it deals with all workers. The mathematical formula for
the ESWI within category j is

ESWIjst =

Σ (Lijstk *Ss1900k)/ mj for i = 1 to mj.

for the state s in year t. The law Lijstk refers to the ith law in category j in state s in year t
covering the kth category of workers. If the law is in force, Lijstk has a value of one; if not, it
takes a value of zero. As an example of how an actual law fits the subscripts, consider bakery
regulation. The bakery regulation law (i) comes under the category Economic Activity
Regulations (j) in West Virginia (s) in 1919 (t) for bakers (k).
To take into account the fact that the bakery regulations only cover bakers and not the
rest of the workforce, we multiply the law by the share of nonfarm workers in baking (k) in
state s in the year 1900 (Ss1900k). The employment weight is one when the k subscript refers to
regulations that apply to all nonagricultural workers.11 The weights for each employment
category k in each state are based on information from the 1900 census on the number of
gainfully employed men, women, and children in occupations in 1900 and the average numbers
of each type employed in various manufacturing industries in 1899 (U.S. Bureau of Census,
1904, 1902 volumes 7 and 8, and Haines (ICPSR 2896)). We chose the 1900/1899 weights to
reflect the situation in the first year for which we make cross-state comparisons of the labor

12

laws. We then continue to use the 1900/1899 weights for all other periods to avoid feedback
problems where changes in regulation are causing changes in the shares of people in industries.
This weighting still potentially has some problems with feedback effects for the 1899 ESW
index. We chose this period to develop the employment shares because we thought that the
situation in 1890 would not be reflective of the employment in the 20th century because the late
1800s were a period of industrial change.

As another way to avoid problems with specific

state distributions being influenced by the labor laws in the state, we have also developed an
index where the weights are based on the national distributions across occupations and
industries (and thus the s subscript is dropped for the employment share). It turns out that the
indices based on the national employment weights are very strongly correlated with the indices
based on the state employment weights.
In calculating the employment shares we use as the denominator an “employment base”
composed of the number of gainfully employed in trade, transport, manufacturing, and
mechanical pursuits from the 1900 Census of Occupations. These categories include miners
and construction workers and were the focus of nearly all of the labor regulations. The
denominator probably overstates the number of people likely to be affected by regulation
because workers in wholesale and retail trade were less affected by the labor regulations. The
workers left out of the base are professional workers, domestic and personal service workers,
and agricultural workers. The agricultural, domestic, and personal service workers were often
explicitly left uncovered by many regulations. Some professionals were licensed and we do
include in the numerator a licensing measure for specific occupations but the workers in these
occupations account for a very small share of the professionals and an even smaller share of

13

workers subject to regulation; therefore, we don’t see that their absence in the denominator will
be a serious problem.12
After weighting the law by the employment share, we sum the values for the laws in
category j and divide by the number of laws in that category (mj). This insures that the
maximum value for category j is one. As seen in Appendix Table 2, the number of laws (mj) in
the Workplace Activity category (j) is 38, so the sum of all of the laws after they have been
weighted by their employment share is then divided by 38. Given that the laws are weighted
by the share of people employed and some of the laws were likely to be focused on only
subgroups of workers, the ESWI for category k could be substantially less than one.
The ESWI for two law categories are based on measures other than pure law counts. In
the employer liability and workers’ compensation category, we used Fishback’s and Kantor’s
(2000) expected benefits measures as a percentage of annual income as the basis for the index.
For years when workers’ compensation was in place the expected benefits were calculated
using the specific parameters for the laws. The typical workers’ compensation value was
above 1 and ranged as high as 2.82. For years in which no workers’ compensation laws were
in force, we started with a ratio of expected benefits to annual income of 0.5 based on Fishback
and Kantor’s comparisons of expected payouts under employer liability and workers’
compensation. The expected benefit/income ratio for states without workers’ compensation
was then adjusted upwards from 0.5 in states where the actuaries suggested higher employer
liability premiums to insurers based on employer liability laws that would lead to higher
payouts to workers. The expected benefit/income ratio was lowered from 0.5 in states where
lower premiums were suggested by the actuaries. The variable is expben10 in the wcdata.xls
Excel spreadsheet under Workers’ Compensation Project Data at

14

http://www.u.arizona.edu/~fishback/ used in March 2006. Descriptions of the construction of
the variable are in Fishback and Kantor (2000, Appendix B) and at the same website. To
index the values we divided by the maximum value of 2.82 so the value would range between
zero and one.
In the male-hours category, a number of states passed general maximum hours laws in
the late 1800s that stated that the official work day was an eight-hour day but typically added
the proviso, “unless specified otherwise by contract.” We gave them a maximum value of 0.1.
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics suggested that these laws had little effect because of the
contracting out clause and lack of enforcement. The laws were weakened further after the U.S.
Supreme Court in 1905 declared that New York state regulation of bakers’ hours violated the
U.S. Constitution.13 We decided to assign them some positive value because some employers
might have routinely followed the law even without much enforcement and because the laws
likely triggered some negotiations of contracts that might have led to hours reductions. Once
the new hours structure was in place, these employers might have decided to leave them in
place even after the 1905 decision.14
To calculate the overall ESWI for a state-year, we take the ESWI for each category j
and sum across all seventeen categories and then divide by 17.15 Thus, the formula for the
overall ESW Index for state s in year t in year

ESWIst =
=

Σ ESWIjst /17 for j = 1 to 17.

Σ (Σ (Lijstk*Ss1900k)/mj for i = 1 to mj)/17 for j = 1 to 17.16

15

The final value has a maximum value of one when all workers are covered by every phase of
regulations that workers favored. If there were no laws except anti-union laws, the value could
fall below zero.
The maps in Figure 1 shows the ESWI for the states in 1899, 1909, 1914, and 1919,
respectively. The scale for each of the maps is the same and is based on putting states into 5
roughly equal groupings based on the ESWIs in 1919; therefore, the changes over time can
also be seen. Figure 2 shows the information in a scatter plot with more precise values visible
for the ESWI for 1899 and 1919. The highest ESWIs in 1899 were above 0.4 in Pennsylvania
and New Jersey, which collectively had the broadest range of industries. Several Midwestern
states, Colorado, Massachusetts, and Montana were next in line.
By 1909 New York had become the leader with an ESWI near .5, while Indiana,
Colorado, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania were close
behind (see Figure 2). By 1919 Massachusetts had surpassed New York, which had stayed in
roughly the same position. The academic and political activity by institutional economists like
John R. Commons and Richard Ely had contributed to Minnesota and Wisconsin being close
behind. Also, among the leaders were Pennsylvania, Ohio, and California. The one state that
seems to have lagged behind was New Jersey.
In general, the rankings of the states with respect to the ESWI are pretty stable over
time. The upward slope of the majority of spots on scatter plots in Figure 2 show that many of
the states who had more labor regulation circa 1899 tended to also rank highly in 1919. The
correlations across time of the ESWIs in Table 2 are all positive and above 0.725.
The changes in labor legislation shed some different light on the labor regulatory
activities in New York. Recent media strongly states that much of the labor legislation of the

16

Progressive Era was stimulated by the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire, in which dozens of
women textile workers died in New York City in March 1911. The rise in the ESWI for New
York between 1899 and 1909 and the relatively small change in the ESWI between 1909 and
1919 suggest that there was a great deal of interest in labor legislation in New York well before
the Fire. The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory had been inspected and no fines imposed within the
prior month even though it was in violation of several of the existing laws with respect to fire
escapes and other fire prevention measures. Many of the legislative changes that followed the
Fire were attempts to tighten these laws and enhance enforcement. The state did eventually
increase its spending on inspections, but the increase in inspectors was small relative to the
number of inspections that would have been required for all factories to be inspected annually.
Scholars have found complaints in New York newspapers after the new laws were passed that
many of the laws were still largely ignored and that inspections continued to be rare events.17

PAGE COUNTS
Some scholars have experimented with using page counts as a measure of labor
regulation (for example, see Mulligan and Shleifer (2004)). The argument is based on the
notion that states with more extensive laws would have to describe them in depth. There are
certainly flaws in this simple method. Laws with negative consequences for labor are given
the same page value as those with positive consequences. The length of the legal text also
might overstate its power. A law banning all labor by children under 16 and appropriating one
million dollars to hire 500 people to enforce it can be stated succinctly. Meanwhile, it might
take a dozen pages to describe a set of regulations designed to make workplaces safer for

17

children. The first does far more to guarantee that a child under 16 is safe from manufacturing
risk.
In other situations states might adopt specific laws for four different industries, while
another state adopts a general law with broader coverage. This happened with hours laws in a
number of states, and the broader laws have greater effect even though the text of the laws is
shorter.
The BLS reports on the text of laws made it relatively easy to develop page counts in
1904, 1907, and 1914 when the volumes were published. The reports do not include
information on the workers’ compensation laws, but this will only affect the measure for
1914.18
As can be seen in Figures 3 and 4, Pennsylvania is far and away the leader in page
counts throughout the early twentieth century with many of the same states with high ESWIs
following behind. Figure 3 shows maps of page counts for the states with the scale used in the
legend based on a roughly equal distribution of states in five categories as of 1914. The
stability of state rankings over time is shown in the scatter plots for the page counts in 1904
and 1914. Most states increase the text of their labor legislation even though workers’
compensation is not included in the 1914 page counts. The states held more tightly to the
relative rankings over time than for the ESWI. The correlations in Table 2 for the page counts
are above .9 for all comparisons across the 18 years covered. Notice that there appears to be
more clumping of states around the same text levels in both periods than we saw with the law
sum and ESW Index.
The situations for Pennsylvania and New York help illustrate the possible
overstatement of regulation from counting pages when there are laws written for specific

18

industries. Pennsylvania probably had the most diverse coverage of American industries of
any state.19 They wrote separate and specific safety regulations for bituminous coal mining,
anthracite coal mining, and the factories. The state ranks near the top in the ESW Index
comparisons, but the large body of text devoted to specific industries is what makes them a
strong outlier here. New York had similar breadth of coverage of industries but had almost no
mining industry and therefore has page counts much closer to the counts in the other states.

EXPENDITURES BY STATES ON LABOR ISSUES
The presence of laws offers only one indication of the regulatory climate for labor
markets in the states. Laws on the books have little impact if they are not enforced and labor
administrators and inspectors are likely to have more influence over labor markets with more
resources available to them. As an additional measure of the labor regulatory climate, we have
collected information from the legislative statutes on the appropriations for the state labor
department, board of arbitration, free employment offices, mining inspection, boiler inspection
and other administrations related to labor markets.20 To date, we have coverage for all states
in the years 1903 through 1916. We then calculate a measure of state labor spending in 1967
dollars per person employed in mining and manufacturing. The denominator does not include
groups of gainfully employed workers who typically were not subject to labor regulation:
agricultural pursuits, domestic and personal service. Railroad workers, street railroad workers,
and professionals were affected by some of the labor regulations, so the use of only mining and
manufacturing as the denominator overstates the spending per worker covered to some degree.
It turns out, however, that the relative ranking of states is generally the same when we try
different groups of workers in the denominators.21

19

The spending per worker serves as an index that simultaneously measures the coverage
of the legislation and the extent to which it is enforced. Enforcement is still imperfectly
measured because enforcement of many safety regulations often relied on the courts so that
violations might have been uncovered but not punished (see Fishback 2006; Graebner 1979).22
Complete bans or bright-line rules might also require little in the way of enforcement or
administration because violations are so obvious. Finally, regulations tend to involve a fixed
cost of basic administration. In states with regulation and small industrial workforces, the
spending per worker measure might overstate the strength of the regulatory climate.
The spending measure tells a somewhat different story than the page and law sum and
index measures. The correlations between time periods reported in Table 3 are weaker, as the
correlation of the 1916 and 1903 measures are much lower at .49 than the correlations for any
of the other measures in the Table. The correlations between the measures for 1903 and 1909
and again for 1909 and 1916 are also somewhat weaker at 0.74 and 0.78.
The maps in Figure 5 and scatter plots in Figure 6 show many similarities to the
comparisons for the other measures. In general, high values of labor spending per worker were
probably associated with more extensive labor regulation. Massachusetts, New York, Indiana,
Ohio, Colorado, Pennsylvania and Minnesota all rank relatively high as they did in the other
rankings.
A number of western states are scattered around the outer range of the scatter plot in
Figure 6. The locations came about through a combination of fixed costs of setting up labor
regulations, small numbers of industrial workers, and generally better labor conditions in the
west. Most of the western states were relatively new to industrialization and had relatively
small numbers of industrial workers. To attract workers western employers tended to pay

20

higher wages. Roughly 20 to 40 percent of the nonagricultural employment base in the
western states was in mining, which was among the most dangerous of activities. The
employers’ desire to attract workers and to limit collective action by active western unions led
them to support the adoption of mining and other regulations in territorial and state legislatures,
a trend actively encouraged by reformers and unionized workers. At the same time
establishing and administering regulations required significant annual fixed costs and the hiring
of inspectors often came in increments of $1000 to $2000. Therefore, as the number of
industrial workers in the West increased, the fixed costs of regulation were divided by an
increasing number of workers, and the spending per worker declined. This helps explain the
declines in real spending associated with Colorado, North Dakota, Idaho, and Wyoming.
Nevada, and Washington were relative latecomers to industrialization and thus by 1916 they
may have been situated in the position where these other western states were sitting in the late
1890s.
West Virginia and Pennsylvania are similar to the western states in that mining, coal in
this case, was a leading industry. Coal miners accounted for a high percentage of the
employment base in both states, higher in West Virginia. Because West Virginia and
Pennsylvania were further advanced in terms of employing miners and other industrial workers
in 1903 and 1916, our sense is that the rise in spending per worker in Pennsylvania and West
Virginia likely reflects more of an increase in intensity of labor regulation than it does for
Nevada, and Washington.

NONPARAMETRIC SPATIAL COORDINATES

21

Our measures thus far have been designed to try to capture the intensity of the
regulatory climate. The various measures each have advantages and disadvantages based on
the weighting given to laws and allocation of spending. The weightings have been explicitly
designed and scholars may have alternative a priori interpretations of the regulations that
would lead them to reweight the laws.
Another route is to take an agnostic approach and use nonparametric methods to
measure the similarities in portfolios of policy choice across states. The method we use is a
version of the Optimal Classification method that Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal have
used to describe voting patterns in Congress.23 The method is designed to establish coordinates
in a “policy space” for which no explicit dimensions are established in advance. The
COORDINATE measures we develop essentially show which states have the combination of
policies that look the most alike. Since we have not pre-assigned any specific weighting
scheme in advance, the COORDINATE measures can serve as a useful robustness check of the
other measures.
In other settings scholars have offered interpretations of what the dimensions of the
policy space mean, similar to the way that social scientists have interpreted the factors that
come out of factor analysis. Poole and Rosenthal (1997, 1994, 1993, 1991), for example, use
their spatial coordinates, called NOMINATEs, to show the degree to which Congressmen
voted in similar ways on a large number of policy issues. They found that after examination of
voting patterns for a large number of issues that the similarities in voting patterns between
Congressmen can be shown relatively effectively by two dimensional coordinates. Although,
their spatial coordinate method does not assign any interpretation to the vertical and horizontal
measures, Poole and Rosenthal assigned ad hoc interpretations to the dimensions by comparing

22

the spatial locations to attributes of the Congressmen, the attributes of their constituents and the
way people voted on a set of laws.
Tomas Nonnenmacher (2002) has applied a nonparametric Binomial Unfolding
technique, which is an updating of NOMINATE by Poole (2000, 2001), for a similar purpose
to ours. Nonnenmacher’s goal was to develop measures of location in policy space for the
states based on the extent to which they adopted the laws collected by Jack Walker (1969) in
his policy diffusion study. As was the case in Poole and Rosenthal’s Congressional study, the
spatial dimensions have no obvious interpretation from the data examined. Nonnenmacher
applies interpretations to the relative rankings based on the extent to which they are correlated
with socio-economic measures.
We estimated two COORDINATEs for each state in each year. In the sample for
estimation we treated each state in each year as a separate observation and included an
observation for each state for each year from 1896 through 1924. By performing the
estimation in this way we developed COORDINATE measures that allowed comparisons both
across states within the same year and also comparisons of the policy choices across time. For
example, by pooling the data and treating Connecticut in 1896 as a separate observation from
Connecticut in 1924, the COORDINATE measures could be used to compare the location of
Connecticut in 1896 to another state like West Virginia in 1896 but also to Connecticut in 1924
or Virginia in 1920.24
The changes over time in the two COORDINATE coordinates are shown in the maps in
Figures 7 and 8 and in the scatter plots in Figure 9. As is the case with factor analysis and the
Congressional voting analysis, there is no obvious interpretation of the dimensions of the
coordinates without adding extra information. Some insights can be gained by examining the

23

correlations with various types of laws. The COORDINATE ONE coordinate, the vertical
coordinate in Figure 9 seems to be strongly associated with factory regulations, while
COORDINATE TWO appears to be strongly associated with mining regulations. The raw
correlations between the COORDINATE ONE measure and the subcategory estimate for
factory regulations is 0.81, while the correlation with the mining subcategory is -0.01.
Meanwhile, the correlation of COORDINATE TWO with the mining regulations subcategory
is 0.63 compared with -0.25 for its correlation with factory regulations. We can see these
patterns in the maps in Figures 7 and 8. COORDINATE ONE has higher values primarily in
manufacturing states in New England in the Midwest, while COORDINATE TWO has higher
values mostly in states known for mining.

IV. Correlations Between the Measures
Each of the measures can be considered to be summary measures in their own right, yet
to some extent they measure different aspects of regulation as well. The relationships between
the measures are shown in Tables 3 and 4. The cross-sectional correlations in Table 3 show
the relationships in 1903, 1909, and again in 1919 between the stock of laws (level of
spending), in essence, a snapshot of the entire body of state codes at a point in time. The same
general patterns (with some minor exceptions) of correlation are present in all three years. In
all three years relatively strong positive correlations above 0.61 can be found between the
levels of the ESWI, the Page Counts, and the COORDINATE ONE measures. Labor
Spending has positive but somewhat weaker correlations with those three measures; between
0.3 and 0.5 with the ESW Index, between 0.2 and 0.39 with the pages and 0.098 to 0.309 with
the COORDINATE ONE. The COORDINATE TWO measure, which appears more focused

24

on mining, has consistent correlations with labor spending per worker that ranges between 0.38
and 0.42. It has positive and weaker correlations with the number of pages, 0.23 to 0.31 and
with the ESWI, 0.12 to 0.22, is also positively correlated.
The changes in the measures of the legal climate arise due to the new legislation
enacted between time periods. Table 4 offers correlations across states for the change over the
entire period from around 1900 to around 1919, and then separately for each of the two
decades. The correlations of changes in the ESWI, labor spending per worker, COORDINATE
ONE, and COORDINATE TWO for entire period from around 1900 to around 1919 range
between .11 and .53 with the weakest correlation between COORDINATE ONE and labor
spending per worker. Most of the strength of the correlations comes from the period 1909 to
around 1919 because the correlations for that period are relatively close to those for the entire
1900 to 1919 period. The correlations from around 1900 to 1909 are much weaker.

NATIONAL CHANGES
The regulatory rise was a nation-wide phenomenon. In every scatter plot comparison
of 1899 and 1919 nearly every state lies above the 45 degree line, which implies that the
regulation measure has grown over time. Similarly, the maps for the regulatory measures all
show a darkening over time for nearly every state. The national rise can also be seen when we
aggregate the measures for the entire United States in Figure 10. We developed the national
ESWI by weighting each of the state ESWI’s in that year by that state’s share of national
employment in that year.25 The national labor spending per worker measure was developed by
the labor spending measure and then dividing by the national total of mining and
manufacturing workers.

25

The national ESWI displays an 0.2 rise in the extent of regulation from 1900 through
1924 from a weighted index of 0.31 in 1899 to over 0.51 in 1924. There was a relatively sharp
rise between 1899 and 1903 and then the trend was relatively flat with a dip in 1908. Between
1908 and 1914 there was a substantial rise in the index from about .35 to about .47 that
coincided with the introduction of many employer liability and workers’ compensation laws.
The trend stayed relatively flat through the end of World War I, followed by a rise to around
0.51 in the aftermath of the War.
Meanwhile labor spending per mining and manufacturing worker in 1967 dollars rose
by roughly 8 cents between 1903 and 1905, stayed flat for several years, and then spiked by
nearly 10 cents in 1908. The spending stayed flat another two years and then rose by nearly 60
cents between 1910 and 1915 with the wave of increased resources for inspection, the
introduction of commissions to operate workers’ compensation, and the expansion in a few
states into Industrial Commissions that had their own rule-making authority. We have not yet
collected information for all states for the period 1917 through 1920, but the information for
the states for which we have collected data suggests that labor spending per worker in 1967
dollars declined. Increases in nominal labor spending were more than outpaced by the
doubling of the consumer prices during that time period.

CORRELATES OF THE LABOR REGULATORY CLIMATE
The overall labor regulatory climate was the result of an accumulation of a broad range
of policy choices in each state. The adoption of each labor law was the result of a series of
proposals, counter proposals, negotiations, and compromises between the specific interest
groups interested in those laws, the legislators, the governor, and voters, directly when the

26

legislation was voted on in a referendum or indirectly through their representatives. At the
same time many of the stances chosen on specific forms of regulation were part of broader
agendas for the major interest groups, employers, unions, nonunion workers, and political
parties. Our goal in this section is to show the fundamental correlations between the labor
climate and politics and economic interest groups. We do this in two ways. First, we examine
cross-sectional correlations that show the long run relationships between these factors and the
stock of laws circa 1903/1904 near the beginning of the period of measurement and again in
1919. Second we examine the factors that influenced the changes in those laws in the first two
decades of the twentieth century.
Table 5 shows the relationship between various measures of the stock of regulation and
a series of political party and economic variables commonly seen as correlates of measures of
labor legislation in 1904 and in 1919.26 We have tried a variety of cross-sectional analyses
using different time periods, and the results are not dramatically different from those reported
here.
The political party variables are the percentage of the population voting in presidential
elections for the Republican presidential candidate, voting for the Socialist candidate, and
voting for the 1912 Progressive Party candidate. We focus more on presidential voting
because the stances taken by the candidates were on nationwide platforms and thus broadly
consistent from state to state. The Democratic and Republican parties’ positions in state
politics often varied to some degree across states, particularly when comparing southern
Democrats to Democrats in the rest of the country. Generally, Democrats outside the South,
Progressives, and Socialists have been considered to have been more in tune with the interest
of unions and workers than were Republicans, so we have incorporated a Democratic governor

27

variable. Since nearly all southern Governors were Democrats, the South region dummy
variable that we included and discuss later serves partly as an interaction term between the
South and Democratic Governor.
We have also incorporated a series of variables that are broadly descriptive of the clout
of major interest groups. An index of unionization shows the extent to which workers in the
state are employed in industries where unions had a stronger nationwide presence. The size of
the labor force and the percentages working in mining, manufacturing, and agriculture give a
sense of the industrial structure of the states. Generally, agricultural states were expected to
be more likely to be opposed to labor regulation, even though agricultural workers were
typically exempted from the rules. There was a fear that the rules might be extended to
agriculture in the future and that better workplaces would make it harder to keep workers from
leaving agriculture for industrial jobs. The relative importance of large and small firms in
manufacturing are measured by the percentage of manufacturing establishments with fewer
than 20 workers and the percentage with more than 500 workers. We include the percentage
foreign-born, black, and illiterate to examine the extent to which their relative lack of political
clout and antipathy toward their presence influenced the labor regulation climate. Finally, to
examine whether the southern legacy of slavery had additional impact on the choice of labor
regulation above and beyond the political and economic factors we have incorporated a dummy
variable for the Southern states that had been members of the Confederacy.27
The results from Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions summarized in Tables 5
and 6 show the relationship of each of the major variables with the stock of the laws and level
of labor spending per worker at the turn of the 20th century and just after World War I, holding
the other correlates constant. The Tables report one-standard-deviation (OSD) relationships

28

that show how many standard deviations the labor regulation measure changes in response to a
one-standard-deviation increase in the correlate. The t-statistic for the coefficient estimate is
reported below each OSD measure. In the case of dummy variables we report the coefficient.
To avoid simultaneity between the correlates and labor regulation measure in the same year,
the values for the correlates with the labor climate in 1904 are from the years 1900 and 1899
and the values for correlates for the later year are from the period around 1910 and 1912. We
have also run the analysis with just the political variables and just the economic variables, and
the basic results reported here for each of the factors are similar to the findings in those
analyses.
The overall size of the gainfully employed has a positive effect on both the ESWI and
the labor spending measure that strengthened over time. An increase of one standard
deviation in the size of the labor force was associated with an increase of 0.166 standard
deviations in the ESWI in 1904 and 0.324 standard deviations in 1919. The OSD relationships
for the labor spending measure were 0.277 in 1904 and 0.286 in 1916. The positive
relationship between the labor force and regulation might arise because of the presence of
substantial fixed costs of setting up and maintaining a regulatory regime. Regulations that
have large public good effects are more likely to be established because so many more workers
benefit relative to the costs of establishing the regulation.28
A higher share of gainfully employed in agriculture was associated with substantially
less regulation as measured by the ESWI but displayed virtually no relationship with the labor
spending measure.29 An OSD rise in the percent of the gainfully employed in agriculture was
associated with a -0.731 standard deviation reduction in the ESWI in 1904 and a -0.791
reduction in 1919. Only the second relationship is estimated precisely enough that it is

29

statistically significant in a two-tailed test at the 10 percent level.30 The farmers’ antipathy
toward regulation was shown not only by their success in ensuring that labor regulations were
not applied to farming in many cases, but also the reduced degree of labor regulation in farm
states. Once the regulations were established, however, the farmers did not appear to display
much opposition to labor spending per worker in the nonagricultural fields. The OSD
relationships with labor spending were both positive and imprecisely estimated.
In contrast, the share of workers in mining had a positive relationship with labor
spending per mining and manufacturing worker. The dangers of the mines contributed to more
extensive safety regulations in mines and a larger ratio of inspectors to workers in mining and
in manufacturing. The OSD relationship was 0.916 for 1904 and 0.43 in 1919, although the
latter was imprecisely estimated, and the hypothesis of no effect can not be rejected at the 10percent level.
A number of scholars have suggested that large firms often contributed to the adoption
of labor regulation, while workers and unions had a more mixed attitude toward regulation,
particularly before 1910, because they feared that employers had enough clout in state
legislatures to control the regulations.31 The results here appear consistent with this description
for the period around 1904, less so for 1919. If unions favored regulation, we would expect to
see strong positive relationships between the regulation measures and the union index.32 The
OSD relationships in states with a larger share of workers in industries with strong national
unions are relatively small and positive in 1904 relative to most other effects in 1904, and they
are not statistically significant.

Large firms in manufacturing, on the other hand, displayed a

strong positive relationship with regulation. The OSD relationships of the share of
establishments with more than 500 workers were 0.549 and 0.705, respectively.

30

Given the controls for unionization and large manufacturing firms, the share of
gainfully employed workers in manufacturing might be considered a measure of the political
clout of either nonunion workers as voters or the overall weight of manufacturing employers
and workers in the state. The share of manufacturing workers has very strong negative OSD
relationships with the measures of labor regulation in 1904. A one standard deviation increase
in the percent of workers in manufacturing was associated with an ESWI that was -0.873
standard deviations lower and a labor spending measure that was -0.557 lower, although only
the former relationship is precisely estimated. The combination of findings for unions, large
employers, and manufacturing suggest an important role for large manufacturing employers as
early progenitors of regulation. By 1919, however, the relationships had weakened
considerably in magnitude and were no longer precisely estimated.
The political party, Democratic governor, and the South dummy generally do not
show consistently strong relationships with the stock of labor legislation at the two points in
time. None of the political coefficients were precisely estimated and we cannot reject the
hypothesis of no effect in two-tailed tests at the 10-percent level. States with more voting for
Socialist presidential candidates were more likely to have more regulation and more labor
spending with OSD relationships of 0.166 and 0.272 in 1904, and similar effects in later years.
Progressive presidential votes in 1912 were slightly negatively associated with labor
regulation. Meanwhile, Republican voting states had fewer laws but greater spending per
worker in both years.

These results fit with findings that Taft, Wilson, and Roosevelt all

included a number of progressive planks related to labor in their political agendas.
States with Democratic governors show no strong association one way or the other with
the state labor climates. The largest OSD relationships for the Democratic Governors were

31

negative for the ESWI in 1904 and higher for the labor spending measure in 1919. Southern
states in both periods were more likely to have lower labor spending per mining and
manufacturing worker with OSD relationships of -0.654. They appeared to have similar levels
of the ESWI in 1904 but -0.309 standard deviation lower levels in 1919. Thus, after
controlling for other economic features, the southern legacy appears to be more laws and less
labor spending per worker in 1904, and less of both in 1919. Although here again, the
coefficients are all imprecisely estimated.
Since the stock of legislation was the accumulation of a large number of laws that may
have been passed between one to thirty years earlier, we also examine the relationships
between the correlates and the change in labor legislation within the decade. Table 6 shows the
OSD effects from regressions with two observations for nearly every state, the change in labor
legislation or labor spending per worker in the first decade of the 1900s and the changes in the
second decade. The correlates are measures of the situation at the beginning of each decade
in most cases. The exceptions are measures of the number of changes in the political party of
the governor and the party in power in the houses of the state legislature during the decade.
These were included because studies by Fishback and Kantor (2000) and Pavalko (1989) both
found effects of party power shifts on the adoption of workers’ compensation.
Estimates are reported for regressions with and without fixed effects for the states and
the timing. The state fixed effects are dummy variables for all states except Connecticut that
are used to control for unmeasured factors that do not change over time within the same state
but vary across states over time. These would include long-term political and economic
features of the state that are unchanging over time, as well as the physical terrain of the state.
The Second Decade year effect is a dummy variable for the observations on changes in labor

32

regulation for the second decade of the 1900s. The dummy acts as a control for unmeasured
nationwide factors that affected all states, including World War I or a national recession. The
OSD effects in the estimations incorporating fixed effects are similar to estimating the average
difference-in-difference relationship across states. In essence, we are seeing, on average, how
differences in the correlates within the states influence differences in the changes in the state
labor climate.
The main result that comes out of the analysis is the finding that the changes in the
labor measure have a strong negative relationship with the prior stock of labor legislation or the
prior level of labor spending. States with ESWI laws at the beginning of the period that are
one standard deviation higher, experience changes in labor legislation that is -0.634 standard
deviations lower in the absence of fixed effects and

-1.953 standard deviations lower when

fixed effects are incorporated. The OSD effects are smaller for the labor spending per worker
at -0.298 without fixed effects and -0.762 with fixed effects. The results suggest that there tend
to be a reasonably strong catch-up effects in labor legislation. Other states eventually join the
early adopting states in adopting many forms of labor legislation. In the fixed effects analysis,
states with a larger share of large firms are more likely to adopt new legislation although not
necessarily to increase spending per worker.
Most of the strong effects found when fixed effects are not incorporated in the analysis
are weakened or reversed with the inclusion of fixed effects. This includes the positive
relationships for the share of the population voting Socialist for president for both labor
measures. For labor spending per worker, the positive relationships are reversed for the mining
share and the agricultural share, the percent foreign-born, and diminished sharply for the
number of changes in the party in charge of the lower house of the legislature.

33

In the fixed effects analysis there were sizeable OSD relationships between the labor
measures and the number of gainfully employed workers and the percent black (OSDs over 1
for both). Large firms had a strong positive OSD relationship with the ESWI at 0.81, as did
Democratic Governors at 0.676. Collective action had mixed effects. Increased strike activity
during the decade was associated with over 0.6 OSD relationships with both measures.
Meanwhile, the unionization index showed both a positive relationship with the ESWI and a
negative relationship with the spending measures. In all of these cases, some care must be
exercised in drawing conclusions due to the imprecision of the estimation shown by the low
absolute values of the t-statistics.
The fixed effects show the effects of unmeasured factors related to the states that
influenced the choice of labor legislation. The states that ranked in the top 10 in unmeasured
factors that were positively related to larger increases in the ESWI, include, in order from the
top, the western and Midwestern states of Colorado, Montana, Nevada, Idaho, Utah,
Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Kansas, and Iowa. The bottom ten were generally in the
South and the Mid-Atlantic, including from bottom South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida,
Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Virginia, North Carolina, Texas, and New York.
The states that ranked in the top 10 in unmeasured factors that were positively related to
larger increases in labor regulation spending per worker, include, in order from the top, the
mostly western states of North Dakota, Idaho, South Dakota, Nevada, Montana, New Mexico,
Arizona, West Virginia, Minnesota, and Colorado. The bottom ten were again generally in the
South and the Mid-Atlantic, including from bottom Mississippi, South Carolina, Georgia,
Louisiana, Florida, Alabama, Virginia,New York, North Carolina, and Maryland.

34

Note that these estimates are effects estimated after controlling for the size of the labor
force, the shares of mining, agriculture, firm sizes, industrial mix related to unionization, and
many political factors. The results for the changes in laws thus suggest a stronger negative role
for the unmeasured Southern Legacy than the results for the stock of laws. The results also
leave a great deal of room for the important type of institutional analysis traditionally
performed in narrative labor and business histories.

CONCLUSIONS
The regulatory climate in the labor arena during the progressive era was marked by
both great breadth and complexity. In the search for understanding about the interrelationships between labor markets, politics, and labor regulation we need both summary
measures as well as studies in-depth of the institutions. The summary measures allow people
to make broad comparisons of the overall labor regulation across states and how these changed
over time. There is no doubt that they can be improved by going into more depth on each type
of regulation. Suggestions for improvement, particularly when accompanied by new
information that will improve the measures, are welcome.
Further, we can use the measures to perform rudimentary statistical analysis of the
interactions of these factors. The brief analysis of the correlates of the stock of labor regulation
and the changes in labor regulation show several important relationships that appear after
holding other factors constant. The extent of labor regulation was related to the overall size of
the labor force. States with larger establishments tended to have more regulation early on and
were more likely to adopt changes in labor legislation. States with industries with a strong
national union presence do not seem to be associated positively or negatively with the

35

regulatory climate. States that lagged behind the early adopters tended to eventually catch-up
and adopt many forms of labor regulation. Finally, southern states were typically at the bottom
of the list in terms of making changes in their regulations.
The results of the analysis also show that the statistical studies can only carry us part of
the way toward understanding the development of labor regulation. Hidden in the fixed
effects in the statistical analysis are many factors in the states that are not necessarily easily
measured quantitatively. Careful analysis of both statistical and narrative evidence is
important for understanding the relationships between labor regulations and the society. Our
hope is that scholars of all types find these summary measures useful for comparative purposes
in their own work.

Sources: First Labor Bureau refers to the introduction of either a commissioner of labor, a bureau of
labor statistics, or a factory inspector. Factory inspection adopted refers to the first statutory provision
for a factory inspector. For dates of adoption of inspectors and departments of labor I started with
evidence from Brandeis (1935, pp. 628-645) and the U.S. Commissioner of Labor (1896). When the
precise date of introduction was unknown, the microfiche for the State Session Laws of American
States and Territories was searched until the original act was found. The earliest commissioner of labor
was in Massachusetts in 1869 and the earliest factory inspector was in Massachusetts in 1879.
Information on workers and establishments for 1880 is from the Report on Manufacturing for the
Eleventh Census (U.S. Census Bureau, 1895, pp. 67-69). Information on Industrial Commissions is
from Brandeis (1935, p. 654), who was citing work of John Andrews of the American Association of
Labor Legislation. The information on the adoption of workers’ compensation is from Fishback and
Kantor (2000, pp. 103-4). Information that was not available is marked as n.a. Year of coal law
adoption is from Aldrich (1997, p. 70).

The initial Maryland law in 1868 was for agriculture and industry with most of the focus on
agriculture. The code of 1888 with amendments in 1892 is more specific to industry.
j
The Minnesota law included language about enforcing laws and prosecuting violations by the
commissioner but only funds for the commissioner were provided.

q
The Tennessee Law called for the Bureau of Agriculture, Mining, and Statistics to collect
information on labor. The original Bureau of Agriculture was established in 1871, became the Bureau
of Agriculture, Mining, and Statistics in 1875, but appears to have obtained the role of collecting labor
statistics sometime between 1881 and 1884. We have had trouble pinning down the date.
r
In Tennessee and West Virginia there were no regular inspectors. Commissioner merely had
the power to inspect.
s
The Utah legislature had authorized a bureau of labor statistics or labor department earlier.
t
West Virginia gave the commissioner the power to inspect workplaces but only to report on
findings there.

Notes. The One-Standard Deviation (OSD) Effects for continuous variables show the number
of standard deviations by which the dependent variable changes with respect to a one-standarddeviation increase in the variable. The OSD Effects for dummy variables show the number of
standard deviations by which the dependent variable changes with respect to a move from zero
to one of the dummy variable. Robust t-statistics are presented in italics below the OSD
Effects. Means with Standard Deviations are reported for each of the Correlates to the right of
the OSD Effects and the t-statistics.
The dependent variables are the ESWI in 1904 and 1919 and Labor Spending (in
$1967) per mining and manufacturing worker in 1904 and 1916. For the ESWI in 1904 the
mean is 0.24 and the standard deviation is 0.125, for the labor spending measure in 1904 the
mean is 0.42 and standard deviation is 0.36. For the ESWI in 1919 the mean is 0.35 and the
standard deviation is 0.14, for the labor spending measure in 1916 the mean is 0.92 and
standard deviation is 0.77.
There are observations for all 48 states in the 1916 and 1919 regressions. Arizona,
New Mexico, and Oklahoma are missing from the 1904 regressions due to lack of presidential
voting information in 1900. The data sources are described in Fishback and Kantor (2000) and
the data on all correlates were pulled from the workers’ compensation data sets on Price
Fishback’s website at the University of Arizona Department of Economics:
http://economics.eller.arizona.edu/faculty/Fishback.aspx.

Notes. The numbers for continuous variables show the number of standard deviations by
which the dependent variable changes with respect to a one-standard-deviation increase in the
variable. The numbers for dummy variables show the number of standard deviations by which
the dependent variable changes with respect to a move from zero to one of the dummy
variable. Robust t-statistics, clustered by states are presented in italics below the numbers.
The dependent variables are the change in the ESWI between 1899 and 1909 and again
from 1909 to 1919 and the change in Labor Spending (in $1967) per mining and manufacturing
worker between 1903 and 1909 and again from 1909 to 1916. The means are .077 for the
changes in the ESWI and .25 for the labor spending measure with standard deviations of .073
and .43 respectively.
There are two observations for each state except Arizona, New Mexico, and Oklahoma,
which did not have presidential voting in the first period. The values for most variables are
from the beginning of the decade. Presidential voting for the early observation is from 1900
and from 1912 for the later observation. The democratic governor variable is from 1900 and
1909. The manufacturing size variables are from 1899 and 1909, the gainful employment
shares for mining, manufacturing, and agriculture are from 1900 and 1910. The change in the
governor and changes in party control of legislatures are for the periods 1900 to 1909 and 1910
to 1919. The data sources are described in Fishback and Kantor (2000) and the data are
available from Price Fishback’s website at the University of Arizona Department of
Economics: http://economics.eller.arizona.edu/faculty/Fishback.aspx.

alternative metrics.

The Heritage Foundation posts the latest version of the Index of Economic Freedom at its
website, http://www.heritage.org/Index/. Freedom House posts historical listings of their scores in
excel files at http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=1. An overview of these measures was
reported in a World Bank working paper by Gerardo Munck (2003) at
http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTMOVOUTPOV/Resources/21042151148063363276/071503_Munck.pdf. For examples of empirical studies that use these measures see

within the United States, Rosenbloom (2002, 1998) on the development of U.S. regional and interregional labor markets and strike activity. For discussions of the role of the state in U.S. labor relations
in the early twentieth century, see Brody (1980), Montgomery (1987), and Dubofsky (1994). Brody
(2005), and Tope (2007) discuss the interaction between government policies and the decline of
unionism in the United States. International comparisons illustrate the importance of the state. See
Howell (1992, 2005) on the role played by governments in industrial relations in France, and Britain
and the volume on 34 countries edited by Phelan (2007).

In the area of labor laws, Fishback and Kantor (2000 and 1995) and Allen (2005) developed summary
measures designed to capture the generosity of workers’ compensation benefits. In a similar fashion, Boyer

(1990) constructed a variety of measures of the nature of poor relief for children in Britain during the
Industrial Revolution. For other examples, see Currie and Ferrie, 2000; Eyestone 1977; Botero, et. al.
2004, and the papers in Freeman and Ichniowski (1989). Wallace, Rubin, and Smith (1988) used
information from an unpublished working paper by Ann Orloff (1983) to develop a labor law count of
“pro-labor laws,” but we have not been able to find a measure of that count as yet.

See Brandeis (1966). For a discussion of the role played by institutional labor economists see Moss (1996).

This finding helps explain why many studies have found relatively small effects of several
forms of labor regulation. For example, see Moehling (1999), Sanderson (1974), Osterman (1979),
Brown Christiansen, and Phillips (1982), and Carter and Sutch (1996a) on child labor, Goldin (1990)
and Whaples (1990a, b) on women’s hours laws, Fishback and Kantor (2000), Buffum (1992), Chelius
(1976, 1977), Fishback (1986, 1987, 1990), and Aldrich (1997) on workers’ compensation and
employer liability laws, Fishback (1986, 1990) on coal mining regulations, and Aldrich (1997, 2006) on
safety regulations in manufacturing, mines, and railroads. Child labor legislation had little impact on
employment of children, but Margo and Finegan (1996) and Lleras-Muney (2002) find that school
attendance legislation did significantly raise the rate of school attendance. A number of regulations had
larger impact. Here we are citing findings of limited impact.

The exceptions were railroads, maritime workers and other workers who routinely travelled
across state boundaries when they worked. Yet, as will be seen below the states also adopted
regulations of railroads. For more detail on railroads, see Aldrich (1997, 2006).

census.

For the licensing categories we used the shares of people in the profession from that national

We explored use of two other denominators, the total number of workers in gainful
employment in 1900 as the base and the number of workers gainfully employed in mining and
manufacturing. These two measures were correlated with the employment base in the text at levels
above 0.8 and we don’t believe they will change the conclusions much.
13
The 1905 Lochner v. New York Supreme Court decision that declared unconstitutional limits
on bakers’ hours in New York chilled efforts to establish wages and hours limits for male workers for
some time.
14
We also need to consider the issue of what weight to give to other hours laws for men in other
industries after the Lochner decision. We plan to work on this issue further.
15
The coverage of the general hours laws and industry-specific hours laws is extremely
confusing and we are still working on better ways to understand situations where there appears to be
overlap in coverage.
16
We do all of the weighting by employment share within the subcategory indexes, so we do not
need to weight again when summing across subcategories to develop the general index.
17
Recent popular media that oversell the role of the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire include von Drehle
(2003) and the widely seen PBS special on the history of New York and its companion volume by
Burns, Sanders, and Ade (2003). Stein (1962), McEvoy (1995), and Fishback 2006 offer discussions
that show more fully the extent of regulation before and after the fire.
18
We developed a rough count of the number of characters on a standard line for each volume
by measuring the word employer, which was 1.3 millimeters in length in all volumes and dividing into
the width of the page (11.1 millimeters in the 1896, and 9.2, 9.4, and 9.5 millimeters in the 1904, 1907,
and 1914 volumes). We then counted the lines on a full page of text (68 in 1896, 65 in 1904, 66 in
1907, and 67 in 1914. We adjusted for the amount of text for each state on the beginning and ending
pages of their sections in the book. This is still a rough measure because we did not adjust for spacing
in the pages caused by law titles or for footnotes, of which there were not many. The BLS also reported
on laws in 1925 but provided abbreviated descriptions of some laws when they had changed little from
the 1914 volume; therefore, we could not use the information effectively.
19
We are considering incorporating some type of H-index to capture diversity of industries
when trying to explain the indices, and also controlling for the diversity in regressions on productivity,
hours, and earnings.
20
The measure in the text is a summary measure that combines all aspects of labor
administration and enforcement. We have tried to separate out the specific appropriations for
inspections (even to the level of differences for mining and factory inspectors) as opposed to
administration for all of the states. We have succeeded so far in making this separation for only a
subset of the states. In several states the appropriations are not separated into specific categories. Since
our focus is on comparisons across all states we use the broadest measure of labor administration,
which is comparable across states.
21
The number employed in mining and manufacturing comes from the occupational information
reported in the population Censuses of 1900, 1910, 1920, and 1930 (U.S. Bureau of the Census,1902,
vol. 2, 508; 1913, vol. 4, 44-45; 1923, vol. 4, 48; 1933, vol 5, 54). To get values in the intervening
years we use a straight-line interpolation between census years. The number gainfully employed
includes agricultural workers and thus overstates the number of workers who were likely to be covered
by labor regulations. We have explored dividing by the number of gainfully employed workers, which
includes a larger number of workers in agriculture. It turns out that the cross-sectional correlations
between spending per mining and manufacturing workers and the spending per gainfully employed
worker are above .86 in 1903, 1909, and 1916. The cross-sectional correlations in the changes in the
two measures between 1903 and 1909, 1903 and 1916, and 1909 and 1916 are all above 0.88.
Therefore, we only report the measure divided by the mining and manufacturing workers in the text.

We have computerized information on fines for many specific laws, but we have not yet
determined a way to incorporate them into the analysis. One reason we have not pursued this further is
that in situations where fines were high, enforcers appeared to be less willing to impose them.
23
Rebecca Holmes (2003, 2005) used principal component analysis to perform a similar data
mining exercise with the law data in her dissertation. We switched to the Optimal Classification
measure because factor analysis is better suited to settings where the variables analyzed are continuous,
while the procedures that create the COORDINATE measures are specifically designed for variables
that are zero-one in nature.
24
We estimated the COORDINATES using the Optimal Classification procedure used by Poole
and Rosenthal and described on Poole’s website at the University of California at San Diego:
http://voteview.com/. Sam Allen made adjustments to the program to fit our analysis. The procedure
takes multiple binary choices for numerous decision-makers and non-parametrically infers
"coordinates" for each decision-maker that yield the greatest number of correctly classified choices. In
Poole and Rosenthal’s example for Congress, the decision-makers are legislators and the choices are
roll call votes that take the form Yea or Nay. Each legislator has an ideal coordinate within a unit
hypersphere where the dimensions are arbitrarily chosen. These are not ever observed since only
Yes/No votes are recorded. In our instance, the decision-makers are states, the choices are yes or no on
enactment of 140 specific types of labor laws. The procedure will work with missing values, but
generally this does not happen as our 48 states either had the labor legislation or did not at any given
point in time.
The number of law choices determines the number of "cutting planes" through the unit
hypersphere. As more laws are considered, the unit hypersphere can be divided into more 'regions' or
slices. Each decision-maker is assumed to have an ideal location within the hypersphere corresponding
to its ideal combination of yes/no choices. Each decision-maker is assumed to select the yes or no
choice closest to its ideal coordinate. The optimal classification program developed by Poole and
Rosenthal essentially 'moves' the cutting lines to create regions that minimize the number of
classification errors. In this context a classification error might mean placing states that voted against
mining laws with states that voted for mining laws. As the number of decisions increases, the ideal
coordinates for each decision maker are measured more precisely.
Essentially, after choosing a pair of starting coordinates and two dimensions, the estimation
processes each decision in an iterative fashion and estimates the coordinates for each state that
minimize the number of classification errors. The number of decisions examined for each state-year
was 140. After the estimation was complete the program showed the number of decisions correctly
classified for each state year. The mean and median for the percentage correctly classified for the 1392
state-year observations were both 86.4 percent. The highest percentage was 97.1 (Oregon in 1901 and
Arizona in 1900) and the lowest 69.3 (Washington in 1921-1924).
25
The employment shares came from the occupational censuses of 1900, 1910, 1920, and 1930
with interpolations based on national employment totals between the census years.
26
The data come from the Workers’ Compensation data sets developed by Price Fishback and
Shawn Kantor and located at Price Fishback’s website at the University of Arizona Economics
Department. The excel files and descriptions of the construction of and the sources of the data are
provided there. The sources and data are also described in Fishback and Kantor (2000, 260-7)
27
For examples of discussions of the southern legacy of slavery and the impact on southern
labor markets, see Friedman (2000), Rosenbloom (2002), and Wright (1986). The south includes the
following slave state members of the confederacy: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana,
Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia.
28
See Mulligan and Shleifer for one argument along these lines.
29

The gainfully employed in agriculture include farmers and anybody who describes themselves as
gainfully employed in a farming occupation.

We focus on the magnitude of the OSD effects in the tradition of “oomph” social science that
McCloskey and Ziliak (2004, 2008) are working to promote. We also talk about the precision of the fit with
respect to Type I error as a means of taking into the potential errors in inference that might arise when there are a
small number of observations. The small number contributes to a greater likelihood of Type II error.
31
For example, see Fishback (1998), Fishback and Kantor (2000), Lubove (1967), Moss (1996),
Weinstein (1967, 1968), Wiebe (1962),

The South was notable for having less unionization in industries where nation-wide unions
were relatively strong (Friedman (2000). We have tried estimating the regressions with interaction
terms between the South dummy and the Unionization index. The results changed very little and the
coefficients on the interaction terms were generally small and statistically insignificant.
