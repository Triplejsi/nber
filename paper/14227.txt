WORKER RESPONSES TO SHIRKING UNDER SHARED CAPITALISM
Richard Freeman, Douglas Kruse, and Joseph Blasi
NBER Working Paper No. 14227
August 2008
JEL No. J33,J54,L23
ABSTRACT
Group incentive systems have to overcome the free rider or 1/N problem, which gives workers an
incentive to shirk, if they are to succeed. This paper uses new questions on responses to shirking from
the General Social Survey and a special NBER survey of workers at over 300 worksites in 14 companies
that have some form of group incentive pay to examine how well workers can monitor their peers
and what they do when the peers are not working up to speed. The paper finds that: 1) most workers
say that they can detect fellow employees who shirk; 2) many report that they would speak to the shirker
or report the behavior or a supervisor, and many report that they did so in the past; 3) the proportion
that takes action against shirkers is greatest among workers paid under group incentive systems, in
smaller companies, and in companies with good employee-management relations; 4) group incentives
interact with high-performance human resource policies such as employee involvement teams, training,
task variety, low levels of supervision, and good fixed wages to induce more workers to act against
shirking; 5) workers in workplaces where there is more anti-shirking behavior report that co-workers
work harder, encourage other workers more, and report that their workplace facility is more effective
in ways that should raise productivity and profits.

What do workers do when they see someone slacking off in ways that reduce the
productivity of their work group and enterprise?
The rational response depends on the circumstances. In a tournament race for promotion,
having a competitor slack off is good news. You don’t have to go all out to win the promotion.
In a piece-rate pay system where the firm lowers the rate per piece when workers produce more
than expected, you will also welcome the shirker. The more other workers shirk, the less likely it
is that management will lower the rate per piece and make it harder to earn your weekly pay.
But when part of workers’ pay comes in the form of some group incentive such as profitsharing or share ownership or stock options, a worker who does not do his or her job takes
“money out of the pocket” of other workers. The group would be better off if someone acted
against the shirker. But standard analysis suggests that it will rarely be rational for anyone to
intervene. The costs of intervening with the shirker fall on the intervener but that person gets
only part of the benefit (in an N worker group the worker who intervenes gains 1/Nth of the
benefit going to workers and none of the benefit that goes to capital). The implication is that
rational workers will not act against a shirker just as rational players should not cooperate in a
prisoner’s dilemma game. Group incentive systems are thus doomed to failure.
The facts for labor practices as for prisoner’s dilemma and other games of cooperation
are different. Team production and group incentive plans, which succeed only if they overcome
free riding and shirking, are widespread in modern economies. Since workers often have better
information than management on what fellow workers are doing, worker responses to shirking
are critical to the success or failure of these schemes. Many workplaces develop cultures where
workers discourage others from shirking. Lab experiments find cooperative behavior in
1

collective goods games when game theory rationality predicts that the rational player defects.
Directly relevant to our analysis, Fehr and Gachter (2000) have found that individuals punish
defectors in laboratory experiments even when it is not in their individual self-interest to do so,
due to norms of reciprocity that are strong among many individuals. Peer monitoring has also
been found in group loans in Third World credit markets (Stiglitz 1990). Punishing free riders at
a workplace may also benefit the intervener in the long run if other members of the group
appreciate that person’s action against free riders. They may reap long term rewards in the form
of higher esteem and greater influence within a group. Self-interest aside, the evidence from
anthropologists that voluntarily “policing” cooperation occurs in many societies suggests that it
may be hardwired from evolution. Some economists have suggested how ostracism can be
effective in promoting cooperation (Hirshleifer and Rasmussen 2003).
This study examines worker reactions to shirking by analyzing questions that we
developed and put on the 2002 and 2006 General Social Surveys (GSS) and on surveys of 14
companies that have some forms of group incentive plans that we conducted through the NBER.
We asked workers about the ease of observing co-workers' performance, and the likelihood of
responding to poor work performance. Our analysis of these questions, together with questions
about incentive systems, firm human resource policies, and other aspects of the workplace, show:
1. Most workers believe that they can readily detect shirking by fellow employees.
2. Workers are most likely to take action against shirkers in workplaces where
employees are paid by some form of “shared capitalism” – by which we mean profit sharing,
gain sharing, stock options, or other forms of ownership – and they participate in decisions or
work in team settings.
2

3. Responses to these forms of group incentive pay are largest when they trust
management and have good employee management relations, and when the firm adopts highperformance human resource policies, low levels of supervision, and pays fixed wages at or
above market levels along with the incentive pay.
4. Consistent with the theory of free riding, anti-shirking behavior is greater in smaller
firms and is particularly strong in small firms with shared capitalist pay.
5. Workers in workplaces where there is more anti-shirking behavior report that coworkers work harder, encourage other workers more, and report that their workplace facility is
more effective in several dimensions related to productivity and profits.
The bottom line is that “shared capitalist“ arrangements – defined broadly as those in
which firms share rewards and decision-making with workers -- and positive labor relations
encourage workers to act against shirking behavior and thus strengthen the potential for group
incentive systems and team production to overcome the free rider problem and succeed.
Group incentives and monitoring colleagues
When will a worker act against a shirking fellow employee?
The natural economics answer is that a worker will so act when it pays off for that
person, which almost invariably requires group incentive pay. Building on Drago and Garvey
(1998), it is easy to show that workers are more likely to intervene the higher the amount of the
group incentive, the higher the probability that intervening increases the performance of the coworker, the lower the cost of intervening (which may depend on individual incentives), and the
smaller the number of co-workers. In addition, workers may gain respect from fellow workers
and supervisors, which can translate into greater chances of promotion in the future. Workers
3

may discourage "shirkers" through peer pressure and non pecuniary sanctions such as social
ostracism, personal guilt, or shame (Kandel and Lazear 1991). Since the 1/N problem is smaller
at small workplaces, cooperative agreements should be easier to establish and maintain in small
companies than in large ones.
Workers can also engage in punishing behavior to enforce group norms of high effort,
and change the behavior of free riders. Punishment may be effective in counteracting the free
rider effect per the experimental results of Carpenter (2004). He explains his results by noting
that an increase in the size of a group has two opposing effects: it “forces monitors to spread
their resources thinner which might lead to more free riding,” but “there are also more people
monitoring each free rider so it is not obvious whether the total amount of punishment each free
rider receives will increase or decrease” (2004: 4). Prendergast suggests that monitoring with a
sufficiently low cost can negate the free rider problem but notes that “empirical evidence on peer
pressure reveals behavioral responses different from those posited in the theory”.1
Finally in the workplace setting, management may seek to develop a corporate culture
that emphasizes company spirit, promotes group cooperation, encourages social enforcement
mechanisms, and so forth in order to encourage cooperative actions (Weitzman and Kruse, 1990;
Blasi, Conte, and Kruse, 1996; Blasi, Kruse, and Bernstein, 2003: 226-228). Fudenberg and
Maskin (1986) show how the free rider problem can be overcome in an ongoing relationship by a
cooperative agreement among participants. Using artificial agent modeling with small groups,
Axelrod (1997) has shown how mutual cooperation can develop among agents through

1 Prendergast cites Weiss’ study of workers in a pharmaceutical company (1987) and Hansen’s examination (1997)
of the incentives of telephone operators for a large financial corporation. Both found that group incentives improved
the performance of workers who were less productive under individual schemes but decreased the performance of

4

reciprocity. Klos and Nooteboom (2001) explore the creation of interaction networks that have
trust as a major component.
Whatever model one uses to explain punishment of free riders, workers should be more
likely to act against shirker when they: a) have some financial interest in the performance of the
firm; b) regularly participate in workplace decisions, which should reduce the cost of speaking
out; and c) have trust in management and good labor-management relations, since in those
situations, they can reasonably expect the firm to reward them for helping to reduce shirking. If
you don’t trust management, you can hardly be expected to report shirking to management. If
you regard labor-management relations as poor, you may view shirking as a justifiable response
to management’s poor treatment of workers.
Data
Our study asked about worker responses to shirker behavior on two datasets. The first
dataset comes from the 2002 and 2006 General Social Surveys (GSS), on which we placed
several questions on shared capitalism programs. The GSS is a national area probability sample
of non institutionalized adults conducted by NORC. The 2002 GSS has a sample of 1,145
employees, and the 2006 GSS has a sample of 1,081 employees, in for-profit companies. The
second dataset is based on surveys of employees in 14 companies with over 300 worksites that
had one or more shared capitalist incentive program in 2001-2006 that we conducted as part of
the NBER Shared Capitalism research program.2 The response rates from employees averaged

more productive workers
2 We drew up a sample of firms varying in size, industry, and type of program, and contacted them in various ways
to participate. As is usual in this sort of research, we were able to convince only some firms o participate. Once
firms agreed to the survey, we surveyed either all employees or a random sample of employees. The survey
included core questions common across all companies, and some questions of special interest or relevance to that

5

53% across the 14 companies. A total of 41,206 respondents provided usable surveys. Question
wordings and descriptive statistics for both surveys are in Appendix A.
Neither survey is ideal. The GSS is nationally representative, but has limited numbers of
persons with different forms of compensation arrangements, which makes it hard to reach
statistically valid conclusions in some areas. Because it is a small national sample, workers are
likely to all be employed by different firms so that we view comparisons among workers as
comparisons across firms. The NBER has a large number of respondents but they are taken from
a sample of firms that is non random. Because the NBER survey covers a small number of
firms, much of the variation comes from variation among workers within firms, and we generally
include firm fixed effects in analyses to focus on this variation. By combining analyses of the
small national sample that lives on cross-company variation and the larger non-random sample
of workers from participating companies that lives on within- company variation, we hopefully
surmount these weaknesses and can reach conclusions that have general validity.
The innovation of our study is the new questions about workers’ ability to detect the
performance of other workers at their workplace and their actions if they observed shirking. We
asked about the ability of workers to observe their peers’ effort because that is a necessary
precondition for acting against shirking:
In your job how easy is it for you to see whether your co-workers are working well or
poorly? On a scale of 0 to 10 please describe with 0 meaning not at all easy to see and 10
meaning very easy to see

company. Six company surveys were conducted over the web, seven company surveys were done on paper, and one
survey was done using both the web and paper surveys. Two firms that agreed to participate were bought out by
other firms, who did not want to cooperate with the study.

Figure 1A displays the frequency distribution of answers from the GSS. The distribution
is concentrated at the upper end, with 49% of workers giving the highest possible answer about
the ease of detecting how co-workers are doing, and another 28% giving answers in the 7-9
categories. Responses are also bunched at the 0 category as well, with 8% of workers giving this
answer but otherwise there is a paucity of responses at the low end. Thus, the vast majority of
workers think they have a good idea of how hard their fellow employees are working. Looking
at which employees report being able to observe co-workers shows a priori sensible variation
among employees. Workers who answered with a 7 or more to the question reported
disproportionately that they work in a team as opposed to by themselves, and that they rely on
coworkers and supervisors for help, compared to workers who answered 3 or less on seeing how
coworkers perform (data not shown but available). In addition, 13% who answered 7 or higher
reported that they are managers compared to 7% of those answered 3 or less.
Figure 1B displays the frequency distribution of answers from the NBER survey. The
largest single group of respondents gave the maximum answer to their ability to observe their
fellow employees, but the distribution is less concentrated than the distribution in the GSS, with
proportionately half as many workers giving the 10 response. Still, 62% of respondents gave a
response of 7 or more to the observability question.
Given that most workers say that they can observe the effort of co-workers, what do they
do if they catch someone shirking? Our question was:
If you were to see a fellow employee not working as hard or well as he or she should,
how likely would you be to:
A. Talk directly to the employee;
B. Speak to your supervisor or manager;
7

C. Do nothing
D. (contained on only some company surveys) Talk about it in a work group or team3;
The responses use a four-point scale: not at all likely, not very likely, somewhat likely,
and very likely. As a simple way to display the responses to these questions, we formed a
summated rating anti-shirking index reflecting the likelihood of intervention against shirkers
using a 1 to 4 scale, where 1 measures the lowest intervention and 4 the greatest intervention, by
simply adding the values of responses across questions (Bartholemew et al, 2002). The antishirking index ranges from 3 to 12 for the observations based on the A to C responses and from 4
to 16 for the smaller sample for which we asked part D as well. In this ordering a 12 means that
the worker reported that it was very likely they would talk to the shirking employee and very
likely that they would talk to the supervisor and not at all likely that they would do nothing. A 3
means that they said it was very unlikely they would talk to the shirking employee, very unlikely
they would talk to the supervisor, and very likely they would do nothing.
Figure 2A summarizes the responses from the GSS. It shows that the summary statistic
differentiates people in a relatively continuous way. If we organize the data into five bins,
grouping the 3 and 4 responses, and the 5 and 6 responses, and so on, the distribution looks
roughly uniform. The anti-shirking index has a mean of 7.81 and a standard deviation of 2.94.
Figure 2B gives the anti-shirking index for the NBER survey data. With the larger sample, the
distribution has proportionately more persons in the middle of the distribution, which gives it a
rough normal look. But again, there is wide variation. Some people are likely to take action
against a shirker and some are likely to do little. Our goal is to find out what differentiates
workers in this form of behavior.

8

Table 1 shows for both data sets the proportion of workers who said it was likely or not
likely that they would take one of the actions in response to shirking behavior by a fellow
employee. One finding is that more workers in the GSS sample than in the NBER companies
say they would be “very likely” to take action against shirkers, which would seem to go against
the idea that shared capitalism encourages anti-shirking activities; this difference, however, is
primarily due to the larger establishment sizes in the NBER sample, and the difference is
reversed when controlling for this and other factors distinguishing the samples.4 In addition, the
table shows that the greater concentration of responses at the upper end of the distribution in the
GSS than in the NBER data set is due to the great proportion in the former who say they would
talk to the shirking employee: 32.4% in the GSS versus 16.7% in the NBER dataset. In the GSS
proportionately more workers say that it is very likely that they would talk to an employee than
would talk to a supervisor or manager, whereas in the NBER data set about the same proportion
say it is very likely they would talk to the shirker as to a manager.5
To move from hypothetical responses to actual behavior, in some company surveys we
added a question, "Have you ever seen one of your fellow employees not working as hard or well
as he or she should over an extended time period?" Over half, 59%, of the respondents said yes.6

3 This option was not included in the 2002 GSS and the early NBER surveys.
4 GSS employees are also younger on average, and more likely to say they can see how well their co-workers are
working. When these two variables and establishment size are used in the GSS sample to predict anti-shirking, the
predicted mean for the NBER sample is less than the actual mean, indicating that the NBER employees are generally
more likely than would be expected to take action against shirkers.
5 Since some respondents said that they did not have a supervisor or manager the sample size of answers to that
question is smaller than the sample size for the other questions. One possible objection to the anti-shirking index is
that it combines disparate behaviors that may substitute for each other—for example, a worker may choose between
talking to the shirker or supervisor but not want to do both. We find, however, that the responses are highly
correlated (the alpha for the index is .80 in the GSS data and .69 in the NBER data). We also present results for
each response separately in Table 4a and find results consistent with those using the anti-shirking index.
6 The mean of the anti-shirking index for the 41% of workers who said they have not seen a co-worker shirking is
not significantly different from the mean for the 59%, suggesting that there is no systematic difference in

9

We then asked what they did in response. As seen in Table 2, 34% of the employees talked to
the shirker, 46% talked to a supervisor or manager, 20% talked about it in a work group or team,
5% did something else, and 29% did nothing (row 1). Most important, these answers correlate
highly with the respondents' reported likelihood of taking this action, as shown in rows 2 to 5:
for example, 82% of those who said they were very likely to talk to the shirker actually did so,
while only 6% of those who said it was not likely they would talk to the shirker actually did so.
From the tabulations in Figures 1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b, and Tables 1 and 2, we conclude that:
most workers can tell when a fellow employee is shirking or not; there is wide variation in what
they will do when faced with a situation in which someone shirks; and that this variation reflects
variation in actual past behavior.

Shared Capitalist Arrangements: Group Incentives and Labor Policies
We have a wide set of measures of the group incentives and labor policies that we expect
to affect worker responses to shirking behavior. As far as we know, ours is the most
comprehensive survey of group incentive policies in the United States. The overall prevalence of
shared capitalist compensation is presented in Appendix Tables A-1 and A-2. The most
important result is that 45% of the for-profit private sector employees in the GSS sample report
participating in some kind of shared capitalism program (36% in profit sharing, 25% in gainsharing, 19% in employee ownership, and 11% in stock options). This gives us good variation
for examining the relation of these programs to worker outcomes. Regarding other work policies,
the 2002 and 2006 GSS asked whether employees normally work as part of a team and how

willingness to take action against shirkers between these two groups.

10

often they participate with others in determining how things are done at their job. Over half
(58%) of private sector workers report working in a team setting, and 44% report that they often
participate with others in helping set the way things are done on a job.
The prevalence of group incentives is necessarily higher in the NBER sample, since these
firms were selected on the basis of having one or more shared capitalism programs. About twothirds report profit sharing (71%) and owning company stock (64%), while about one-fifth report
gainsharing (21%) and holding stock options (22%). The figure for working as part of a team
(59%) is similar to that for the GSS, and about one-third (35%) report being part of an employee
involvement team.
As a first step in assessing the relation of shared capitalism to employee outcomes, we
constructed a thermometer-style index of shared capitalism, which assigns points based on
coverage by shared capitalism programs and the size of the financial stakes. This index is
described in Appendix B. We also present results breaking out the different forms of shared
capitalism types and intensities.
Shared Capitalist Incentives and Shirking
To examine the determinants of anti-shirking behavior, we first regressed the antishirking index on organizational/company policy variables and job and demographic factors. As
seen in Table 3, the shared capitalism index is linked to greater anti-shirking activity in both the
GSS and NBER datasets. Among the covariates, the ease of observing co-workers has a strong
positive effect on the anti-shirking index, consistent with the idea that workers will be more
likely to take action the greater the observability of shirking behavior. The participation
variables have a substantial positive impact on the anti-shirking index in both datasets, as does
11

job security in the NBER dataset. Job task variety also has a strong positive effect (consistent
with Drago and Garvey, 1998), indicating that knowledge of how to help is greater, and the costs
of helping are lower, when the worker has a broader base of skills and overlap of tasks with the
shirking co-worker. Those who are supervised more closely are less likely to engage in antishirking behavior in the NBER dataset, perhaps reflecting a belief among closely-supervised
workers that dealing with shirking is the supervisor's responsibility (to be addressed in Table 8).
Finally, the data shows that the size of the workplace has a strong impact on anti-shirking
behavior, with workers more likely to intervene more to stop shirking in a smaller workplace,
where the shirking of one co-worker is more likely to affect them more than it would in a larger
workplace.
The specific behaviors making up the anti-shirking index are analyzed separately in
Tables 4a and 4b. The shared capitalism index is a positive predictor of each type of antishirking behavior in both the GSS and NBER data, except for the likelihood of talking in a work
group in the GSS data. It seems that many workers with shared capitalism do not wish to talk
about the shirker to the group in the shirker’s presence as they might find this embarrassing
(consistent with concerns by workers that the shirker might resent them or other employees
would react poorly, as presented in Table 8.)
Types of shared capitalism
Which shared capitalism policies are responsible for the results given in our indices?
Table 6 uses different types and intensities of shared capitalism to predict taking action against
shirking. In the GSS data, the most important factors behind anti-shirking activity is the
presence of profit sharing and gain-sharing (col. 1). In the NBER data, it is the intensity rather
12

than the presence of profit sharing and gain sharing that seems to matter. The NBER results in
column 2 show a very strong effect of the profit/gain sharing bonus size (not eligibility), along
with strong positive effects of stock option holding and owning any company stock.
When the richer NBER data are used for a more detailed breakdown of shared capitalism
in column 3 (along with more extensive controls, mirroring the specification in Table 3), antishirking activity is strongly related to both profit sharing bonus size and gain sharing bonus size.
There is one seemingly odd result, however. The negative coefficient on eligibility combined
with the positive coefficient on bonus size indicate that when the profit share is small, those
eligible for profit sharing are less likely than non-eligible employees to take action. As will be
seen in Table 8, shared capitalism appears to increase the fear that co-workers will resent any
anti-shirking action, so that low levels of profit sharing may have a negative effect on antishirking activity but this reluctance is apparently overcome as the bonus grows larger. For gain
sharing, by contrast, simple eligibility increases anti-shirking behavior.
Consistent with the results of Drago and Garvey (1998), the effect of greater individual
bonuses is negative and significant on anti-shirking behavior (column 3). Apparently, individual
bonuses focus workers on their own work and may lead them to see co-workers as competitors
(or at least not cooperators). By contrast, workers who received a stock option grant last year
where more likely to take action against shirkers, although the size of the grant, and of one's
holdings, do not seem to make a difference (col. 3). Owning company stock is no longer a
significant predictor in column 3, although in supplementary regressions (not reported here) we
positive associations with some forms of ownership -- ESPP participation, holding stock after
exercising options, holding stock purchased on the open market, and ESOP membership (this
13

latter result only when company fixed effects are not used7).

That ownership appears to operate

through simply owning stock and not the size of one's stake is consistent with findings from
several other studies, which they attribute to higher organizational commitment (reviewed in
Kruse and Blasi, 1997). Eight out of ten of the workers reporting employee ownership in the
2002 GSS report they also have some form of profit/gain sharing or stock options, which
indicates that some managers recognize the value of combining short-term rewards and longterm equity (Blasi, Kruse, and Freeman 2006: 7)
Before/After on Profit Sharing
The cross section data presented so far are consistent with the theory that shared
capitalism affect the response of workers to shirking co-workers but cannot rule out the
possibility that there are missing variables or other processes that affect results. As we were
conducting our survey, one firm told us that they intended to introduce a new profit-sharing plan
that offered the chance to conduct a before/after analysis as well as a cross-section analysis of
worker responses to group incentives. Accordingly, we administered our survey twice at this
firm, six months apart, with the first survey coming before the firm introduced a new profitsharing plan, and the second survey coming after the firm had introduced the new plan.8
As shown in Table 6, the introduction of the profit-sharing plan led to a jump in the
percent of employees saying they are eligible for profit sharing from 59% at the first survey to

7 Company fixed effects are probably inappropriate to use in analyzing the effects of ESOP membership, since
ERISA rules provide strict guidelines to ensure broad coverage. The small number of non-ESOP members are
likely to be very different from the ESOP members within a firm, and the effects of ESOP membership may be
better judged by comparing ESOP members to otherwise-similar workers in other firms.
8 The analyses presented so far use only the responses to the second survey at this company, to avoid having more
than one survey from some employees. The surveys did not have individual identifiers so respondents could not be
tracked across the two surveys. The higher response rate in the second survey is due in part to the provision of a $5
bill accompanying this survey, but the surveys appear equally representative since the means on all variables (apart

14

88% at the second survey. Apart from this, only two variables in the entire survey showed
significant changes between the surveys: the percent who say they were very likely to talk to a
shirking co-worker (increase from 42% to 55%), and the percent who say that they would do
something about a shirker because poor performance would hurt the bonus or stock value (from
39% to 56%). The fact that these are the only three variables that changed between the surveys
indicates that there were not compositional changes or other policy changes that affected the
results. These results lend support to the prior findings, pointing toward a positive effect of
profit sharing in attempts to combat co-worker shirking.
Complementarities
Analysis of the decision equation for workers to intervene against shirking suggests that
some of the factors that influence behavior should enter equations in an interactive rather than
linear way.. The worker decides to intervene against a shirker when the expected benefits of
intervening exceed the costs: p (G) – Cost, where p is the probability that the intervention will
succeed, G is the gain to the worker and C is the cost. The financial incentive would affect G;
participation should affect p and the cost. Labor-management relations L-M might affect both G
and p. More complicated analyses, in which the worker is assumed to take account of the
possible behavior of other employees, lead to even more complexity, which we will ignore.
Instead, we have looked for potential interactions among key variables in determining antishirking behavior.
Using the nationally representative GSS data, Table 7a examines how shared capitalism
interacts with company size, and Table 7b examines how it interacts with other company

from those highlighted in Table 8) were not significantly different between the two surveys.

15

policies. Shared capitalism is most strongly associated with taking action against shirkers in the
smallest workplaces, as shown in column 1 of Table 7a. The supports the idea that the 1/N
problem will be lower in smaller workplaces (note that the base estimates continue to show more
anti-shirking activity among workers in small companies without profit/gain sharing, indicating
that shirking may be perceived as more of an economic threat in small enterprises generally).
The shared capitalist index effect is also significant in the next two larger size classes, and
positive although not significant in the two largest classes. An equally or even more important
factor, however, appears to be the quality of the relationship with management. As shown in
column 2, shared capitalism is associated with anti-shirking activity most strongly when
combined with a high level of trust in management. While this could simply reflect column 1's
finding of a more positive effect in small companies, the results in column 2 are maintained
when the smallest companies are deleted (not shown here). Similar results are obtained when
shared capitalism is interacted with view of employee-management relations.9 These results
indicate that employees are likely to take action to increase productivity only when they are
confident that any gains will in fact be shared with workers. This suggests that large companies
can use improved employee-management relations to counteract the 1/N problem.10

9 The correlation between trust in management and view of employee management relations is .60, indicating they
appear to represent a common attitude.
10 We examined other ways in which shared capitalism arrangements may interact with workplace policies. The
positive shared capitalism effect on the likelihood of taking action against shirkers is lower among those who plan to
look for a new job in the next year (presumably because they will not be around to receive the profit share), and in
companies with high injury rates (which could worsen management employee relations and decrease expected
tenure). While some models predict that financial participation will have a positive interaction with participation in
decision-making in affecting worker motivation and performance (e.g., Ben-Ner and Jones, 1995), we do not find
significant interactions using the GSS participation measures (which are subjective and may mediate the effects of
shared capitalism). Further, we did not find that employee stock ownership or holding stock options alone were
related to anti-shirking behavior. This is consistent with the research literature and our findings in this and related
papers in the NBER project that employee ownership and stock options generally interact with company culture in
impacting performance, although there is evidence that employee ownership directly improves commitment. Also,

16

This result does not, however, carry over to within-company comparisons in the NBER
data. The most positive effect of shared capitalism on anti-shirking activity still occurs among
employees with the most trust in management, but the shared capitalism index has a positive
effect even when the NBER employees disagree that management is trustworthy. We do not
have a ready explanation for the difference between the two datasets. Because almost all
employees in the GSS sample work in different companies, we do not know if the positive
interaction between shared capitalism and employee-management relations in that data set
reflects the effect of companies with good employee-management relations in general, or of
individuals who perceive good relations within a company (even if their co-workers do not). We
did some exploration of company and individual differences in the NBER data and found that
anti-shirking behavior is generally strong in companies with higher average grades of employeemanagement relations and trust in management, no matter the individual employee's grades of
these items. This suggests the importance of company culture in fostering an environment
encouraging peer pressure.
The role of complementary company policies is explored with the NBER data in Table
7b. Column 1 essentially replicates the specification from Table 3, adding a control for the
worker's perception that his or her fixed pay is at or above market level. The strong positive
effect of the wage variable is consistent with efficiency wage theories which posit that worker
behavior can be improved when they are better paid. The shared capitalism index remains a
positive predictor as this control is introduced. The effect appears to be contingent, however, on

as noted, it is possible that some managers combine profit sharing and equity participation in order to get synergy
between them.

other workplace policies. The shared capitalist index has a strong positive interaction with a
high performance policy index (col. 2), supporting the idea of complementarities among these
policies in affecting worker behavior.11 The shared capitalist index also has a strong negative
interaction with closeness of supervision, and a positive interaction with having fixed pay at or
above market level. The negative supervision interaction may reflect a negative reaction to the
mixed message received by workers: we want you to work harder due to company-based pay,
but we're nonetheless going to watch you very closely. In this case the shared capitalism might
be perceived by workers as primarily risk-sharing. The positive interaction with having fixed
pay at or above the market level may reflect a more positive response by workers when the
company seems to be truly sharing, and not asking the worker to sacrifice pay levels in exchange
for shared capitalist incentives. Forms of employee ownership that are combined with belowmarket pay might not be optimal for anti-shirking behavior because the incentive is diluted
through what workers perceive as wage substitution.
These interaction results for supervision and high-performance policies are illustrated in
Figure 3. This figure shows how there is a positive relation between shared capitalism and the
anti-shirking index only when there are high-performance policies and average or low levels of
supervision. Otherwise the relationship is negative.
Thus, incentive intensity is strongly related to anti-shirking activity, but appears to work
best as part of a high-performance work system where workers are paid well and not supervised
too closely. These results are consistent with the findings of Ichniowski et al. that workplace

11 These results showing the value of embedding such participation in a system of high performance work policies
are consistent with the analysis of Appelbaum, Bailey, Berg, and Kalleberg (2000) and Huselid (1995).

productivity is improved by combining several high-performance HR policies, and show that
worker response to shirkers is likely an important mechanism in the higher productivity.
Reasons For/Against Acting Against Shirkers
The dynamics underlying taking action against shirkers are explored more fully in Table
8, which records employee responses to questions about why they might or might not do
something about a shirking co-worker. These questions were asked on only some of our
company surveys. Over half of workers said they would be likely to do something because the
employee's performance could affect their own jobs (56%), reflecting interdependent work where
cooperation can be especially productive. Almost half of workers said they would do something
because they would want to keep work standards high (47%), which can be seen as reflecting a
cooperative solution to reinforce high work norms. Almost as many workers expressed a
financial incentive, saying the poor performance would lead to lower bonus or stock value
(43%), while 45% said they simply like helping others and 31% said the employee might help
them in the future.
The responses are related to level of participation in shared capitalism. For example, the
percent saying that poor performance would lead to lower bonus or stock value is almost twice as
high among those with a high value on the shared capitalism index (58%, in col. 4) relative to
those with a low value on the index (32% in col. 2). Similarly, the former group is more likely to
say they would do it to keep work standard high (59% compared to 42%). Column 5 shows that
the shared capitalism index is a strong predictor of five of the reasons for taking action. 12

12 One possible objection to our focus on shared capitalism is that there are many reasons workers take action
against shirkers, as shown in this table. Of course, workers report and probably have a variety of reasons -- which
may also include simply noticing incompetence , as noted by Erik Maskin in discussing our paper -- and we do not

19

The predominant reason for not taking action against shirkers is that it's seen as the
supervisor's job (45%) followed closely by the fear that the shirking employee would resent it
(41%). About one-fourth (23%) feared that other employees would react poorly, while less than
one-tenth (8%) directly expressed free ridership by saying that some other employee would
probably take action. The shared capitalism index is a strong predictor of the fear that the
shirking employee would resent the action, perhaps because the intervener would be seen as
acting out of a financial concern rather than out of concern for the worker. As noted earlier, this
may help explain why very low levels of profit sharing appear to be associated with reduced
likelihood of taking action against shirkers—an effect that is more than counterbalanced by other
reasons as the bonus size grows. The shared capitalist index also, not surprisingly, predicts a
lower likelihood that the employee will say there's no financial benefit or "nothing in it for me
personally" (col. 5). Therefore these data are consistent with the idea that shared capitalism can
affect worker behavior.
Outcomes of Anti-shirking Activity
What happened as a result of the action? The data in Table 9 point up one of the dangers
of taking action, as one-third (35%) of the workers said that the employee who was not working
well resented it. The most likely outcome, however, was that other employees appreciated the
action (45%), while almost as many said the supervisor appreciated it (40%), and just over onethird said that the employee's performance improved (36%).

pretend that workers have the simple motive of “anti-shirking” in their minds, or that shared capitalism is the only
motivator. These results show that shared capitalism is not related to two of the key reasons for taking action (“I
like helping others” and “Employee may help me in the future”), but is clearly related to several reasons that reflect
a concern with site performance efficiency.

20

Does it help economic performance? Only a minority of workers report that the
employee's performance improved, but this may still be enough to make a difference in
workplace performance. Also, apart from actual anti-shirking actions, people may work harder
simply knowing that their co-workers are likely to do something if they see signs of shirking.
We do not have hard performance data, but we do have several survey measures of co-worker
and facility performance that show a strong relationship with our anti-shirking measures. Table
10 shows that those who report a higher likelihood of talking to a shirker, and a lower likelihood
of doing nothing, rate their co-workers' effort higher on a 0-10 scale. The anti-shirking index is
very strongly related not just to this measure, but also to a perception that workers tend to
encourage each other, and to ratings of the facility on five specific measures of performance.
Since several of these measures involve workers reporting on the behavior of others, it lessens
the probability that that the interveners are putting a good spin on their behavior by reporting
higher performance, as one reviewer has cautioned. To check the possibility that this simply
reflects individual characteristics (e.g., greater optimism about company performance among
those who say they would take action against shirkers), we also calculated these relationships at
the site level and found that worksites with higher average scores on the anti-shirking index also
had significantly higher average evaluations of workplace performance. This is illustrated in
Figure 4 for one of our performance measures (evaluations of co-workers performance).13
Therefore this does not simply reflect an individual reporting phenomenon: shared views of

13 We also find that site-level averages of the anti-shirking index are strongly related to site-level averages of a
worker-reported performance index (containing the five items from the bottom of Table 10) and employee loyalty to
the organization, although there is no strong relationship to site-level averages of willingness to work hard and
turnover intention. For one large multinational, the dataset has a number of hard operational measures of efficiency,
but only at an aggregate division level, which makes analysis problematic.

21

higher performance in a workplace are related to shared commitments to take action against
shirkers. It appears that the propensity for anti-shirking activity does make a difference in
performance.
One possible objection to these findings is that some production processes are difficult to
supervise by managers so that work is arranged to rely on peer intervention. Shared capitalism
may be used not to encourage anti-shirking behavior, but directly to deter shirking, so that peer
intervention and shared capitalism are both consequences of technologies rather than causally
related to each other. Our pre/post results in Table 6 go against this explanation. We also tested
this by examining the relationship in different industries, and by controlling for detailed
manufacturing technologies (in our diversified multinational firm with diverse technologies such
as plastics and aerospace). The shared capitalism effect does not disappear, but in fact gets
slightly stronger with more detailed controls for production technologies, making us more
confident that anti-shirking intentions and behavior are a result of shared capitalism and
company culture.14
Conclusion
This study has examined employee responses to new questions on the 2002 and 2006
General Social Surveys and a large database of NBER employee surveys on whether workers can

14 One limitation of our study is the lack of a measure of shirking per se. However, we did ask each employee in
two companies covering to respond on a 1-5 scale whether “There are days when I don’t put much effort into my
job.” Analysis of this variable indicates that workers reporting high effort are the ones who are more likely to
intervene against shirkers. Moreover, there is no direct relationship between the shared capitalism index and
increased individual effort. This reflects the finding that the principal impact of shared capitalism appears to work
in combination with various aspects of company culture such as trust, high performance work systems, and fixed
wages at or above market. This suggests that shared capitalism alone nor unique production systems dependent on
technologies are not creating anti-shirking work systems, but rather that shared capitalism enhances anti-shirking
together with company culture, and shared capitalism and positive company culture also impact the potential
shirker’s level of effort. These additional analyses are available from the authors.

easily observe whether co-workers are shirking and how workers respond to shirking. The
answers to the new questions provide valuable insight into the likely magnitude of mutual
monitoring and peer pressure against shirking behavior. They show that most workers believe
that they are able to observe the effort/activity of fellow workers, which is the first prerequisite
for mutual monitoring and peer pressure against shirking to work. In addition, about half of the
work force says that they would be very likely to respond to poor job performance by coworkers, with more saying that they would talk to the shirker rather than reporting the behavior
to management. While there are some demographic correlates to responding against shirking,
workplace factors are more strongly related to employee efforts to reduce shirking. This
conflicts with the claim that broad-based incentives will be weak for everyone because of free
riding.15
Employees respond more against shirking in workplaces with shared capitalism
institutions, and the findings suggest important complementarities between shared capitalism and
high-performance policies, supervision intensity, and being paid at least the market wage.

15 The standard theory does not predict no anti-shirking intervention but only that it is likely to be suboptimal. As
our discussant Eric Maskin noted, there is “no way of telling what optimal intervention would be.” Our study does
suggest, however, how the corporation can be structured to increase anti-shirking behavior and performance.

APPENDIX B: The shared capitalist thermometer index
As a first step in assessing the relation of shared capitalism to employee outcomes, we
constructed a thermometer-style index of shared capitalism. This index assigns one point each
when the worker was covered by any of the shared capitalist forms of compensation about which
the survey asked, with additional points for recent bonuses or grants, and for large bonuses or
stock holdings. For questions with a continuous numeric answer, we gave the item a value of 1
if the respondent had a value greater than the median value. Because there is no natural ordering
of shared capitalist systems in the sense that a firm first introduces profit-sharing, then adds
employee ownership, and then gain-sharing, the index is not a Guttman scale. It is a simple
summated rating (Bartholomew et al, 2002; Bartholomew, 1996), using dichotomous scoring.
In the GSS, there are eight variables in the index: profit sharing eligibility, gain sharing
eligibility, owning any company stock, holding stock options, receiving a profit sharing bonus in
the past year, receiving a gain sharing bonus in the past year, having an above-median profit- and
gain sharing bonus as a percent of pay, and having an above-median company stock holding as a
percent of pay. In the NBER data there are ten variables in the index: all of the above items plus
one point each for receiving a stock option grant in the past year, and having above-median stock
option holdings (including unvested options if they could be exercised today) as a percent of pay.
Indices of this style have both advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, they
provide a quick and ready measure of the extent of shared capitalist arrangements that makes it
easy to compare results across surveys and to summarize the broad thrust of findings. Since our
firm surveys covered only firms with some shared capitalist arrangements, the index allows us to
differentiate workers with differing degrees of incentive to their firm’s programs. On the
29

negative side, the index treats different programs the same even though they potentially have
different effects on particular outcomes. It postulates a single scale with equal weights rather
than using factor analysis or other statistical modelling to obtain weights for given factors. To
deal with these problems, we estimated the relationship of the outcomes to the different types of
shared capitalism, introduced as dummy or continuous variables in regressions.16 Appendix B
gives the results of those calculations. By comparing the results in the appendix tables with
those in the text, we can assess the loss of information due to the amalgamation of the measures
into a single index.
Figure B1 shows the distribution of our shared capitalism index in the GSS. This survey
estimates that 40% of US workers have some form of shared capitalist program. This estimate is
close to that obtained by Dube and Freeman in the WRPS. The mean score of the index is 1.48 –
a figure greatly affected by the substantial number of workers without shared capitalism systems.
Conditional on having a program, most workers report scores in the range of 2 to 5, with 6%
reporting scores of 6 or greater. Figure B2 gives the distribution of the index in the NBER
survey data. It also shows a non-normal distribution, with the most common scores as 2 to 4 but
a sizeable number of workers scoring 7 or above. There is sufficient variation in the index to
differentiate the extent of the shared capitalist “treatment” on workers.

16 There are statistical techniques to deal with the formation of latent variable indices from questions of the sort that
we are amalgamating into a single summated rating. See Bartholomew et al. (2002) and Spector (1992).

Workers were asked "Have you ever seen one of your fellow employees not working as hard or well
as he or she should over an extended time period?" If yes, they were then asked "What action, if any,
did you take?" Those who reported taking some action (see Table 2) were then asked the above
question about the outcome.
