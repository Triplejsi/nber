Unobservable Family and Individual Contributions
to the Distributions of Income and Wealth
ABSTRACT

This paper uses a data set composed of combinations of
full brothers, half brothers as well as fathers and sons to
measure the effect of common family background on households'

income and wealth. While the data is drawn from a nineteenth
century population, the intra—class correlation (after the effects
of age, occupation, nativity, residence and duration in the
economy have been removed) for income ranges from .13 to .18

which is similar to that found in modern samples. Intra—class
correlations for wealth are significantly higher (.18 to .35)

than those for income. The addition of fathers' observed characteristics to the sweeping regressions reduces the unobserved
common background effect shared by brothers by about twenty
percent.

The intra—class correlations of half brothers were lower
than those observed for full brothers though the small differences
between the two groups suggest that fathers played a dominant

role in the transmission of the common family effect. Unobserved
background was decomposed into individual and family effects

by a variance components procedure. The individual effect was
dominant for income while the family effect was dominant for
wealth.

Family members, except perhaps spouses, are certainly genetically and highly

likely to be environmentally more similar than unrelated individuals. This
unobserved common background may very well make family members more similar
in measured socioeconomic position than would be expected for unrelated individuals

with comparable observable individual characteristics. In addition, if parents
are egalitarian within the family, they may make compensatory transfers in

response to differences among siblings. Parental choices of this sort would
also make siblings more similar than comparable unrelated individuals in terms

of socioeconomic outcomes. In the first instance, family members are more
socioeconomically alike because of similarities in backgrounds and characteristics.
In the second instance family members are more socloeconornically alike because

dissimilarities in sibling characteristics trigger compensatory activities
by parents.

On the other hand, efficient parental human capital transfers to children
would not ameliorate the economic effects of ability differences among siblings

assuming ability enhances human capital acquisition. The effect of the family
on the distribution of socioeconomic rewards depends, then, on the variation
in individual characteristics within and between families, market rewards
for those characteristics and the rules of family allocation of parental resources
among children (see Becker and Tomes; Behrman, Pollak and Taubman; Ishikawa;
Loury; and Sheshinskj and Weiss). Behrman, Pollak and Taubman distinguish
two allocational models: the wealth model and the separable earnings—bequest

model. If there are positive material wealth transfers, the former predicts
that such transfers fully compensate for earnings differences. The separable
earnings—bequest model predicts equal transfers. Children may, in either

2
case, have different expected earnings if they have different abilities even
if parents have equal concern for their children.

Failure to account for common family background effects may bias estimates
of the effects of measured individual characteristics (e.g. the return to
education). Considerable effort has been devoted to this problem using sibling
data although Sheshinski and Weiss argue that the importance of the bias depends

upon the family resource allocation rule. Moreover, whether the use of sibling
data lessens or amplifies bias problems depends on whether the common family
effect fully accounts for all ommitted effects and on the possibility of measurement error and simultaneity problems.

(See Griliches, 1979.) Common family

background effects are, however, interesting in their own right precisely
because of the importance of the family resource allocation rule and its embedded

parental preferences. In addition, failure to account for such effects would
lead one to overestimate the degree to which the variance in observable socioeconomic indicators is truly stochastic, unless common family background is
completely reflected in the observable characteristics that individuals have
or choose to acquire. If the potential effects of family background are not
completely reflected in observable individual characteristics, ignoring family
background may cause one to overlook important aspects of the creation and
perpetuation of economic differences among individuals and across generations.
Even where the effects are fully or partially reflected in observable individual
characteristics, we may view these individual characteristics differently
knowing that, in part, they embody a family background shared with other individ-

uals. Finally, if common family background effects are substantial, they
may affect greatly policy development aimed at changing the distribution of
socioeconomic rewards among individuals since the family then becomes an important

3

social institution affecting the distribution of socioeconomic rewards in
addition to the government.

In this paper we explore the degree to which family background, whose source
may be genetics environmental and/or behavioral, explains the variance in
indicators of socioeconomic position for individuals from an economy that
would appear to be quite different from the economy from which modern data
are drawn —— 19th century Utah. Our data allow us to consider two different

kinds of family relationships that between fathers and their sons and that
between brothers. For the latter, we have samples of full brothers raised
in the same home sharing a common father and mother and half brothers raised

in separate homes sharing only a common father. We use two indicators of
socioeconomic position, wealth holdings and income.
We focus on those aspects of common family background that are not measured
directly but whose presence can be inferred from correlations between the
observed socioeconomic positions of family members when the effects of individual

characteristics have been factored out. We also consider the differences
between measured and unmeasured common background by accounting for the observed
individual characteristics of a common father, including the father's income
or wealth, and for the characteristics of the common family such as family
size.

Families can, of course, influence individual choices about individually

acquired characteristics. However, in a series of studies over the past several
years, it has been found that when the effects of individual characteristics
have been accounted for there remains an unmeasured component of the variance
in measures of socioeconomic position that can be attributed to membership

in a common family by siblings. That is, residuals are correlated when individuals

4

are ordered by family membership. For example, Table 1, combined from the
summary work of Jencks and his associates and from a survey by Griliches,
provides the intraclass correlation coefficients for eight recent studies

using sibling data. The intraclass correlation coefficient, which measures
the degree of association between individuals who share the attribute of belonging
to the same family, also measures the percentage of the variance in the socioeconomic indicator that can be attributed to the common characteristic, in

this case family membership. The indicator in these studies is the logarithm
of income or earnings although many of the studies also use occupational status
as an indicator.

For each of the samples of brothers, there is a residual correlation that

is significant. That is, brothers are unlike randomly paired individuals
in their economic position as measured by income. In addition, the variance
that can be explained by sibling membership in a common family exceeds that
which can be explained by observable individual characteristics —— common
family background dominates other measured determinants of a brother's income.
Jencks argues that the NORC sample provides the best estimate of the intraclass
correlation (r=.129) and that the range of raw estimates of r Is likely to

be .12 to .28. That is, family background explains 12 to 28 percent of the

variance in the logarithm of income. When suitable adjustments are made for
sample and measurement bias, Jencks et al. argue that family background probably
explains between 15 and 35 percent of the variance of log income —— a significant
addition to the variance explained by observable individual characteristics.
Brittain, using a small sample of brothers from Cleveland, finds a much
higher intraclass correlation for log income than any of the studies summarized

by Jencks et al. He estimates an intraclass correlation in the .35—.45 range

5

but his is the only study with estimates this high. The intraclass correlation
for occupational status measured by the Duncan scale is still higher around
.48. This may be attributable, in part, to the way that the status measure
is created. But in any event, the correlation attributable to family background
again exceeds that explainable by individual characteristics CR2 is usually
in the .20 to .35 range for occupational status).

The substantial difference that Taubman finds between monozygote and dizygote

twins has ld him and his associates to explore models that separate the common
family background effect into genetic and environmental components. Goldberger
has been skeptical of th? assumptions necessary to pursue this approach but
potential problems in modelling the nature of the family background effect
do not call into question the presence of the family effect itself.
Chamberlain, Griliches and others have explored the possibilites that there
is a common factor accounting for the family effect in a structural model

of ability schooling, occupational status and log income, taking advantage
of the identifiability properties of multiple indicators for latent variable
models. Chamberlain and Taubman et al. have extended the latent variable model
so that the unobserved factor has a variance components structure. These efforts

have been quite successful in changing the estimates of the returns to schooling
but less successful In pushing the various estimates toward a common point.
Chamberlain and Griliches have also explored extensions of these models to
include the possibility that there are two factors that account for the family
effect.

Our aim is initially more modest: Using single equation models, we estimate
the variance component or the intraclass correlation attributable to individuals
sharing a common family background and explore how the estimates differ with

6

the nature of the socioeconomic indicator, the nature of the family relation-

ship and the nature of family background measures available. We also consider
differences between unobserved individual and family effects.

II THE DATA

Our data are drawn from some or all of the following sources: census manuscripts of 1850, 1860, 1870, 1880 and 1900; tax assessment records of 1870,

1859, 1861, 1866, 1870, 1875, 1880, 1885, 1890, 1895, 1900; and family vital
records from the Genealogical Library of the LDS Church.

Estimates of wealth were obtained from the Census manuscripts of 1850,
1860 and 1870 and from tax assessment records for 1870, 1880, 1890 and 1900.
We sampled from both records in 1870 in order to splice the wealth series

from 1850 to 1900 at decade intervals. Both tax assessment and census records
provide estimates of gross rather than net wealth.
Income estimates are obtained from the financial records of the LDS Church

for the 12 years noted earlier. Essentially we cover five year intervals
from 1855 to 1900. LDS financial records indicate the contribution an individual

made to the Church. Church members accepted the moral obligation to contribute
a tithe——ten percent of one's income. In eight of the twelve sample years
we have a record of the percentage that an individual's contribution was relative

to this full tithe. These assessments of tithing paid versus tithing owed
were made by local Church leaders who would personally know the individual

contributor. The individual would also be consulted as to the percentage
of a full tithe that he or she paid. Families usually made their contribution
under the name of the male spouse if there was one although some young men

7

contributed independently to the Church. The combination of the amount contributed
with the percentage of this amount relative to a full tithe yields an estimate

of income. We made adjustments for who those reported income in a particular
year but for whom we did not have percentages by averaging the percentage
paid from other years.

Occupational data have been collected from each census manuscript, available

from 1850 to 1900. Occupations were transcribed into a three—digit code that
combined occupations that were essentially the same, e.g. lawyer and attorney.

We did not create an occupational status scale. Rather, for purposes of analysis,
these codes were aggregated into four categories: white collar workers, managers,
and proprietors (W); farmers, ranchers, dairy owners, etc. (F); craft workers

(C); laborers, farm laborers and other unskilled occupations (L). This left
a heterogeneous mixture of occupations that were largely service oriented,
such as hotel clerks, policemen, lower level clerks, etc. which we classified
in a fifth group as service workers (S).

Both census and genealogical records provide place of birth and age. When

these sources disagreed the genealogical record was used. From these two
records we could obtain most of the vital statistics of interest, including
birth, death and marriage information as well as the implied Information about
household location at particular times, family size and family structure.
These records also provide sibling names (linking brothers) and multiple marriage
information (linking half brothers).
We used place information to provide a record of residence and internal
migration and to provide an estimate of the length of time a household had

been within the economy (T). For analysis purposes, we consider only rural
(R) and urban (U) residence where urban is defined as Salt Lake County.

8
We have linked individuals through time and across records and we have

linked these individual histories by family relationship. The core of the
sample was created by linking census wealth records using name, location,

age and birth place data. We then added a random sample of the households
from each census year that did not appear in more than one of these censuses.

We separately coded links that were "certain" from those for which there were
some discrepancies in name spellings or age estimates between census years,

"uncertains". We were, however, conservative in our efforts and subsequent
analysis has shown no statistically significant differences between "certains"
and "uricertains" and hence we no longer carry the coding distinguishing the

two. To this core of linked and randomly sampled individuals, we added as
many LDS financial records as we could, linked by name across the records

and through the years from 1855 to 1900. We then reversed the procedure: first
linking households in the Church financial records and then adding as much
census information as was possible.
We added to this samples now linked through time and between census and
church financial records, records from either the censuses or financial records

that were potentially fathers and sons. We verified these father—son links
using the family vital statistic records from the Genealogical Library. We
then searched the family vital statistic records for those in the core sample
creating pointers linking those within the sample who were either fathers

and sons or brothers. In addition, we added any records from the population
data for those we could identify as sons or brothers of those in the sample
by using the family vital statistic information.

Not all family links between brothers occur with a link to a father. Since
we searched the family vital statistic records for those in our samples we

9

would often find brothers without finding fathers, who might have been dead

or who might not have migrated to Utah with their sons. This particular aspect
of the sample means that the sibling connections cover the full age range
in each year of the sample and are not restricted to be young in the early

years. We also found a number of new households that were formed over the
fifty year period where we observed the father for a some years and then observed

the father and son. Because of the extended period over which we sampled
we also observe fathers and sometimes sons who die and a small group of three
generation links.

We added to this linked data additional wealth data from the tax assessments
and probates as well as occupational data from the 1880 and 1900 censuses.
For these records we have neither population data nor random samples from

population data. Rather we sought out only those records for individuals
already in our sample. Otherwise, however, we have population data for wealth
from 1850 to 1870 and income from 1855 to 1900.

When we added data, anomolies would appear. At each point we purged from
the data those links that became questionable with the new information. Obvious
checks included: records past death or for an individual who was "too old";
records prior to birth or for an individual who was "too young"; the same
name on multiple records from the same source in the same year; substantial
age inconsistencies.

We

bel ieve that we have been fairly conservative at each point but we should

note that all linking is

by

names with the attendant problems of mispelling

and same names for different Individuals. We tried to avoid both problems
by not selecting or subsequently eliminating those with common names where
the probability was high that there would be several individuals with the

10

same name (e.g. John Jones, James Green). We have differentially coded "certain"
family links from those that were "less certain".
The completed data set is essentially a panel, although an individual need
not appear in each year either because the individual migrated in or formed
a household later in the period; because the individual migrated out or died
during the period; or because we could not make a link in a particular year.
It Is a panel with the unique characteristic that it Is drawn from a fifty

year history of an economy and that it has immediate family links. Tables
2 and 3 provide means and variances by year for fathers, Sons and brothers.

III FAMILY EFFECTS AND INDIVIDUAL INCOME
We test for unobserved family background effects by first estimating several
variations of the now standard human capital specification for Individual
I n come,

(1) ln (Yjj) =

XjjB

where i indexes sibs and j indexes families and

(2) ejj

is the family component of the variance. For some specifications we pooi

the data over all or part of the 50 year period and in these instances impose

a fixed effects model on the aggregate yearly effects. The complete set of
regressions that serve as a basis for our analysis is found in the appendix.
The general properties of the regression results can be seen in the following

pooled regression for brothers taken from Table Al in the appendix:

The regressions are normalized on farmers living in Salt Lake County in

1900 who are U.S. born. Elsewhere we have discussed the properties of these
regressions at length, focusing on the effects of time within the economy
(T), life cycle patterns (A and A2) and changes in residence (R) and occupation

(W,C,S,L,F) in separate papers. (Kearl, Pope and Wimmer, 1980; Kearl and

Pope, 1983a; Kearl and Pope, 1983b.) We note here that virtually all of the
individual characteristics that we measure have the expected statistically
significant effects on ln(y) but that like comparable analysis on modern data
these individual characteristics do not explain a large percentage of the
variance in log income.
Briefly, we find a pronounced concave life cycle in income with the peak

occurring around age 45. Time within the economy (1) has a positive effect
on a

income while those living in the rural areas (R) have lower

incomes, ceteris paribus. Whitecollar workers (W) have higher incomes than
do farmers while craft (C) and service (5) workers have incomes that are not

significantly different from those of farmers. Laborers (L) have incomes
substantially lower than farmers and those in other occupational categories.
We find that foreign born have incomes a bit higher than comparable US born

households. Finally, the pattern of year effects for income essentially accounts

12

for price changes and growth and parallels the price decline over the 50 year

period in the rest of the United States. While the relative magnitudes and
significance of the coefficients change somewhat with specification and sample,
the patterns are essentially the same for all the regressions reported in
the appendix.

We used these estimates to sweep from individual incomes the effects of

measured individual characteristics. Rather than estimating the variance component
directly, we then estimated the intraclass correlation for related pairs using

the resulting residuals. The residuals were stacked so that a member of the
related pair appears as both a dependent and independent variable in a simple

regression of residuals on residuals. This is equivalent to randomly ordering
the observations. The resulting coefficient (the intercept should be zero
since It is the expected value of the residuals) is an estimate of the intraclass

correlation coefficient. A nonzero coefficient indicates that a common omitted
effect links the paired observations that does not link observations of individuals
who are not related. It therefore provides evidence that there is a "family"
effect on individual income that is shared by the related individuals.
We find a significant unobserved family background effect for brothers,

Table 4. Sharing a common family background explains around 20 percent of
the variance In the logarithm of income. Brothers incomes are simply unlike
those of randomly selected unrelated paris of individuals even when we account
for similarities between brothers that are observable, including ages nativity

and occupational choices. Part of the correlation between the economic position
of brothers could be explained by the correlation in the ages (compare specifications 1 and 2, Table 4) reflecting "closer" positions on the income life

13

cycle than those shared by randomly paired unrelated individuals. In fact,
this effect is unimportant.

While age, residence and birthplace correlations between brothers affect
the intraclass correlation estimate very little (compare specifications 1
or 2 with 3), it is clear that part of the influence of family is reflected

in occupational choices that brothers make. The intraclass correlation falls
about 10 precent when the effect of occupational choice is swept out, implying

that brothers' occupational choices are correlated. This is, of course, consistent
with the considerable contemporary evidence on unobserved family effects and
occupational choices.

The size of the estimated family background effect for brothers' incomes
is at the midpoint of the

range. The importance of the unobserved

family background variable(s) relative to that of the observable individual

characteristics is also consistent with modern data. Hence, in terms of the
size of the estimated family background effect, the importance of this effect
relative to observed individual characteristics and the partial transmission
of the family effect through occupational choices made by siblings, our data
reveal similar patterns to those in modern data even though our sample was
created differently and drawn from a dissimilar economy——one that is poor,

agrarian with little emphasis on formal education. Differences among families
appear to be an important and robust determinant of the variance in the distrib—
ution of income among individuals.
In the following sections we consider evidence from our data about the
nature of the unobserved family background effect that is not available in

contemporary data. We first consider the effect for wealth holdings for essentially the same households for which we have estimated the family effect on

14

income. Using both income and wealth as indicators of socioeconomic position,

we then consider differences between full and half brothers. This is followed
by a section where we use a subsample of the data to explore family effects
for brothers and half brothers when we observe the socioeconomic position
of their father. Using a different subsample with multiple observations for
each sib, we then differentiate between unobserved family and unobserved individual
effects.

IV FAMILY EFFECTS AND WEALTh HOLDINGS
We begin with an econometric specification for the logarithm of wealth
holdings comparable to specification (1) for log income:

(4) ln(w) =

4.62 +.089 A —.0008 A2 +.O14 T —.147 FB —.368 R

(.04)

R2= .22
#OB S=3944

Again the full set of equations used in the estimation of the intraclass
correlation coefficient is found in the appendix. While the relative magnitudes
change somewhat with specification and samples specification (4) provides
a general qualitative summary of the results for the wealth specifications
and the relationship between the estimates for wealth and those for income.

15

There is a pronounced concave lifecycle pattern to wealth holdings in our
sample with a peak at age 58 (the comparable age—income peak is at age 45).
Duration within the economy (T) substantially increases wealth holdings and
those who are foreign born or living in the rural area have wealth positions

substantially below US born or those residing in the urban area. For income
we also found a large positive effect for duration and a substantial negative

effect for rural residence. However the effect of foreign birth was positive
for income while it is negative for wealth. White collar workers have wealth
holdings substantially above those for farmers, an effect also seen in income.
However, while service and craft workers have incomes that are not significantly
different from those of farmers, they have wealth holdings that are significantly

lower than those of farmers. Common laborers have substantially lower wealth
holdings and incomes than farmers.
The pattern of year dummies for wealth is more difficult to interpret since

we essentially use them to splice the wealth series in 1870. Hence they reflect
both economic growth and changes In the measured variable between census and
tax assessment records.
Table 5 provides estimates for the intraclass correlation coefficient using
the logarithm of wealth as an indicator of socioeconomic position and when
the effects of the observed individual characteristics have been swept from

ln(W). We find that unobserved family background explains about 30 percent
of the variance in the log of wealth compared to 20 percent of the variance
in the log of income.

The larger intraclass correlation for wealth is consistent with what would
be expected If individual consumption behavior were determined by permanent

rather than observed income. Transitory elements should be a relatively larger

16

component of income than of wealth and hence more of the variance in Income

should be truly stochastic. If individual consumption were determined by
permanent Income, savings would fluctuate with transitory income as would
wealth holdings but the differences in the means between wealth and income
would imply that these fluctuations contributed relatively less to the variance
of wealth. Put differently, differences in family backgrounds are relatively
more important in determining the variance in a more permanent measure of
economic position, wealth, than they are in explaining a measure with a larger
transitory component, income. This suggests that family differences tend to
be associated more closely with permanent differences rather than transitory
differences in the distribution of economic outcomes.
In addition, however, if parents make efficient investment decisions relative
to the human capital accumulation of their children, thereby differentially
investing in siblings in response to differing individual abilities, but want
to be egalitarian within the family, they would compensate those with lesser
ability by engaging in differential intra vivos wealth transfers or provide

compensatory bequests. This compensatory behavior would imply a larger family
background effect on wealth than on income. Indeed, if there were no important
constraints on parental ability to differentially invest according to sib
ability, the intraclass correlation for earnings would be nonzero only if

sibling ability had an unobserved common family component. However, the
transitory elements noted earlier, the likely constraints on parental compensatory
behavior as well as income from capitals do not allow us to interpret the
intraclass correlation for Income as measuring only the unobserved family
element of Individual ability (See Behrman, Pollack and Taubman or Sheshinski

and Weiss). We note that recent attempts to test for efficient human capital

17

intergenerational transfers suggest that bequests do not appear to compensate
for differences in ability (Menchik; Tomes).
For both income and wealth, we used a Chow test for differences in the

intraclass correlation by wealth and household size. In neither case did
we find significant evidence which would indicate that, for example, the intraclass
correlation was higher for brothers with wealthy fathers than for brothers
with poor fathers or that family background effects differed systematically

and substantially between "large" families and "small" families. The latter
is a little surprising since, while common backgrounds differ among families,
it would seem that the differences might be correlated with family size. When
we examine these results in a slightly different way below we do find some

family size effect. We also considered systematic variation in the intraclass
correlation with birth order but also failed to find evidence that birth order

systematically affected the intraclass correlation. In this area, however,
our data present some problems since we have a large number of half brothers
which make sib ordering problematic.
These results are based on data pooled from the full fifty year period

covered by our sample. It is possible that the estimates change with time
as, for example, the economy matures, or that our results reflect a compositional

effect. We have estimated comparable intraclass correlations using only cross
sections of sib pairs and, while the estimates vary somewhat, there are no

systematic patterns different from those of the pooled data set. Another
area of concern about reported intraclass correlations is the possiblity of

correlation between observed characteristics and errors such that E(UiX)
0 so that a random effects specification would involve mismeasurement.
Hausman (1978) proposed a specification test which we have applied to some

18

of our equations. While the overall X2 test based on the decrease in residual
sums of squares with augmented transformed variables (p. 1269, Hausman, 1978)
is failed with a random effects specification; the problems seem to be centered

on the age variables and the life cycle. Further work will be needed to gauge
the importance of the relationship between U. and some of the X..
Perhaps the most serious concern, at present, is the omission of education

from the sweeping regressions. If formal education has a positive influence
on income and wealth as expected the lack of educational data reduces the
variance explained by the regression and increases the measured common background

effect if the education of siblings is correlated. The mismeasurement of
the intraclass correlation in the sweeping regressions such as occupation,
nativity and place of residence proxy for part of the effect of education.

While virtually all of the Utah population was classified as literate on the
census manuscript, formal education was relatively limited in the nineteenth

century Utah. Nevertheless, further work is needed to bound the effect of
omission of education from the sweeping regressions on the measurement of
the family background effect.

V HALF VERSUS FULL BROThERS
We can separate the contribution of the father to the unobserved family
effect from that of being raised in a common home by considering the differences
between full brothers raised in the same home and half brothers who share
a common father but who, in our samples would not have been raised in a common

home. Table 6 provides estimates when the sample is split this way.

Half brothers, on averages share fewer genes than do full brothers. (Expected
excess homozygosity would be 50% for full brothers and 25% for half brothers.)

19
They also, in our sample, do not share a common home since polygynous families
were usually maintained in separate houses or living areas for each wife.
Therefore, half and full brothers would only have similar intraclass correlations
if the dominant component of the family background effect was the contribution

of the father to his children. That is, if the intraclass correlations for
brothers do not differ from those for half brothers, the unobserved family
effects must be primarily non—genetic and primarily attributable to the father's

role in creating a common environment for his sons. Conversely, if half brothers
are no more similar than randomly selected unrelated individuals, then neither
genetics nor the father's role matter and the common family effect would be

attributed solely to the environment shared within a common home. However,
if there are unobserved family background effects for both half and full brothers,
the source of the differences could be both genetic and environmental since
brothers and half brothers differ on both dimensions in our sample.

We clearly do not find that half brothers raised in separate homes are

like randomly selected unrelated individuals. Rather, we find significant
unobserved family background effects for half brothers for both wealth holdings

and for income. Sharing a common father explains about 26 percent of the
variance in log wealth and about 19 percent of the variance in log income
(we continue to find that the common family effect is larger for log wealth

than it is for log income by about 50 percent). Sharing both a common father
and a common mother explains about 30 percent of the variance in log wealth

and about 19 percent of the variance in log income. There is surprisingly
little difference between full brothers and half brothers in this respect
suggesting that in this economy, the father's contribution to the economic

20
success of his children dominates other aspects of the unobserved family variable.
The results cast some doubt on a simple genetic explanation.

We note that a relatively larger share of the family effect appears to
be transmitted through correlated occupational choices for half brothers than

for brothers. That is, when individual occupational choices are accounted
for (specification 4), the intraclass correlation for half brothers, still
significant and maintaining the spread between income and wealth, is relatively

smaller than the comparable intraclass correlations for full brothers. That
is, when we account for occupational choices, sharing a common father explains
15 percent of the variance in log income and 23 percent of the variance in

log wealth. This compares with 29 percent and 18 percent, respectively for
those who share a common father and a common mother. It makes sense, of course,
that an important element in the environment shared by half brothers is the
occupational choice of their common father which may very well influence their

occupational choices. However, there remains a substantial correlation in
the economic position of those raised in separate homes even when we account
for this element of their common environment.

VI OBSERVED AND UNOBSERVED COMMON FAMILY BACKGROUNDS
Brothers share attributes of their common father, including those that

are observable such as father's age, occupation, income or wealth. We now
consider the degree to which the common family background effect present in
our data is adequately accounted for by the observed characteristics of the

sibs' father. The observed socioeconomic position of the father might directly
affect sibs because of the advantages or disadvantages the socioeconomic position

21

allowed the father to confer on his children. Usually interest in this area
centers on income or wealth transfers but there may be more general direct

effects such as access, information or nepotism. Of course there may be indirect
effects for which the observed socioeconomic position of the father proxies.
These might include home environments if such environments differ systematically

with father's socioeconomic status. Finally, to the degree that there are
capital market imperfections that impede intergenerational human capital transfers,
it would be expected that higher income or wealthier parents would be able
to transfer "more" human capital to all sibs and, of course, having made efficient
investment decisions be more capable of providing differential material wealth
transfers.

Tables A.9 and A.1O provide a summary of regressions with log income and
log wealth as dependent variables using the subsample of brothers for whom

we observe the relevant data for their fathers. The parameter estimates for
the individuals own characteristics do not differ much from the regressions

we discussed earlier and the qualitative properties of the regressions do

not change with the extended specification. To these own characteristics
we have appended those noted in the table for the individual's father and
family.

With the exception of white collar for wealth and white collar and craft
for income, father's occupational choice does not directly affect a son's

income or wealth. A son's income and wealth are also statistically unaffected
by the father's age, time within the economy, birth place or place of residence.
Each of these, as we noted earlier, affect a person's own income or wealth
position and hence each indirectly affects the son's position to the degree
that there is a relationship between a father's income or wealth and his son's

22

income or wealth. However, even when we account for the substantial effect
of being a white collar worker on an

income or wealth, there

is an additional substantial advantage conferred on the sons of white collar

workers in this economy. This cannot be skill transmittal or else we would
expect also to see significant positive effects froni fathers who were craftsmen

and perhaps significant negative effects from fathers who were unskilled,

common laborers. We observe neither of these, rather there is no significant
relationship between fathers who are unskilled and their son's income or
wealth and the relationship between fathers who are craftsmen and their sons
is negative for income but not significant for wealth.
A father's income positively affects his son's Income as does a

wealth his son's wealth. A ten percent increase in wealth would yield a 1.5
percent increase in a son's wealth. Put differently, a ten percent deviation
between

wealth would cause a 1.5 percent deviation between the wealth

of sons. The corresponding elasticity for income is about .1. Both of these,
while statistically significant, would indicate substantial regression toward
the mean if there were no other avenues through which fathers affected sons.
For household size, we find that a son in a larger family will have lower

wealth, ceteris paribus. The sign is also negative for income but the coefficient
is not significant. If the family resource allocational rule first allocated
parental resources for human capital accumulation and then compensated with
differentially allocated material wealth among sibs, family size would be

expected to have negative effects on both income and wealth but a larger effect
on wealth so long as families have different material resources.
We used these regressions to once again purge from the dependent variable
the effects of those individual and family characteristics that were observable

23

and then estimated the intraclass correlation for brothers as shown in Table

7. We continue to find a significant unobserved family effect, with unobserved
family background explaining 10 percent of the variation in log income and

19 percent of the variation in log wealth. These compare with 13 and 23 percent
when the observable common background effects are not directly estimated but

are treated as part of the unobservable. Hence, observable common background
characteristics account for only a little over 20 percent of the family effect.

The remaining family affect is not effectIvely proxed by the father's own
socioeconomic position as measured by income, wealth or occupation. This
finding is also consistent with much contemporary work (see Taubman, et al.
for a survey) but most contemporary studies do not have the rich set of characteristics that we have for fathers and hence this finding strengthens somewhat

those drawn from contemporary data. While, as noted above, these results
are roughly consistent with an efficient investment —cum—compensatory transfer
allocational rule, the substantial unobserved family background effect when
observed parental income and wealth are accounted for, suggests that resources
other than material wealth or income are important in intergenerational links.
We can look at the common family effect in a slightly different way by
treating fathers and sons as we have brothers, purging the effects of own
characteristics and then considering the possibilities of correlated residuals

when the individuals are paired by family relationship. Table 8 provides
estimates of the intraclass correlation for log income and wealth of fathers

and sons. It should be noted that the fathers were quite old at the time
the income or wealth was observed contemporaneously with their son's income
or wealth.

24

The low intraclass correlation in specification 1 is to be expected given
the pronounced life cycle pattern in both income and wealth holdings since

the life cycle will explain a substantial amount of the variance for individuals
whose ages are separated by a substantial number of years as would be true

for fathers and sons. This result, in a sense, indirectly confirms the presence
of an age—income or age—wealth profile. When the contribution of age to the
economic position of an individual is accounted for, the intraclass correlations

for income are very close to those estimated from brothers. For wealth holdings,
however, we find about 20 percent of the variance is explained by the unobserved

common background shared by fathers and sons. The unobserved background shared
by brothers explains about 30 percent of the variance for brothers.
Considering fathers and sons rather than brothers indicates the ambiguity

in the notion of "unobserved family background". For brothers, family background
is that unobservable that is common to brothers; for fathers and sons, family

background is that unobservable that is common to fathers and sons. Sons
share one half of the genes of their father. Brothers may share from virtually
0 to 100 percent but on average would also share 50 percent of the genes of

their common father. However, fathers and sons are not raised in the same
homes and hence not in the same home environments. Conversely, brothers,
who have a wider variance in shared genes, are raised in a common home by
a common mother.

While we cannot estimate the relative contributions of genes and environment,
we can jointly estimate the two family effects, father—son and brother—brother.
We assume an error—components model where the error is partitioned into a
brother—brother family component, a father—son family component and a stochastic
component. By construction, the brother—brother component includes only those

25

things common to brothers that are not common to fathers and sons while the
father—son component includes only those things common to fathers and sons

that are not common to brothers. We jointly estimate the components using
a maximum likelihood extimator (LISREL). Table 9 summarizes the results.
The estimated brother—brother variance component is significantly above

the estimated father—son variance component. For log wealth, that unobservable
common to brothers alone explains about 20 to 23 percent of the variance
while that unobservable common to fathers and sons explains about 8 to 10

percent of the variance. For log incomes the percentages are about 10 percent
and 15 percent respectively.

VIII INDIVIDUAL VERSUS FAMILY EFFECTS
The panel nature of our data allow us to consider unobserved individual

effects as well as unobserved family effects since we can use observations

on the same individual at different points in time. Unobserved individual
effects would include those aspects of individual ability that do not change

with time and which are not shared with a sibling. Those aspects of ability
that might change with time are not considered in our analysis. Some, however,
will be captured by the changes in observed individual characteristics such

as occupation that occur with time. We estimate, then, a variance or error
components model using paired brothers with paired observations on each individual
(since we have more than pairs of observations on each Individual, our data
allow for potentially richer and more complex specifications than that estimated

here. We intend to pursue such models later.)

We assume that the error

is generated by a process that includes a family effect, an individual effect
and a stochastic element,

26

(5)

eJ =

u.

+

v

+

Wijk

where i indexes the family, j indexes the individual and k indexes time.
While we use a maximum likelihood estimator (LISREL), loosely, the covariances

between years for the same individual estimate the sum of an individual variance
component and a family variance component while the covariances between sibs

estimate the family component. The family variance component is, thus, directly
estimated while that for the individual is easily recoverable. The observed
error variances for individuals estimate the sum of the family individual

and stochastic components. Table 10 provides estimates for log income and
log wealth for brothers.

Adjusting for the differences in the variances of log income and log wealth
we find that the percentage of the variance attributable to the unobserved
family effect continues to be in the .22—.28 range for wealth and the .15—.19

range for income. The interesting aspect of this model of the covariance
structure for brothers is the relative importance of individual effects for

wealth and income. For wealth, we find that the unobserved individual variance
component is about one half that of the unobserved family variance component.
For income, however, the unobserved individual effect dominates, being over
twice that for the family effect. Moreover, while observable characteristics

explain over 20 percent of the variance in wealth and about 10 percent of
the variance in log income, the total variance explained by observable and
unobservable family and individual characteristics is about 50 percent of
the variance of wealth but around 65 percent of the variance of income.
Again, if ability differences are enhanced by efficient human capital
transfers from parents to children but these transfers are then offset by

27

wealth transfers that are compensatory, the pattern we observe of relatively
larger individual effects and smaller family effects for income and relatively
smaller individual effects and larger family effects for wealth would be produced.

Nothing in this explanation would suggest, of course, that the combined effects

would explain a large or small amount of the variance. It is simply the case
for our data, that the explained variance from the regression analysis on

observed characteristics alone gives a much distorted picture of the nature
of the stochastic contribution to the distributions of income and wealth.

IX CONCLUDING COMMENTS
The variance in family backgrounds appears to be an important contributor

to the dispersion of individual income and wealth. We conclude, based on
the differences between the effect of unobserved family background on income
and wealth, that these effects are more likely related to permanent differences
than transitory differences in the distribution. While we find that part of
this effect is reflected in occupational choices made by related individuals
and another part is explained by the observed socioeconomic position of the
father, most of the effect cannot be explained by either of these two avenues
of intergenerational transmission.
We also find that unobserved individual differences are important contributors

to the variance in socioeconomic positions. Observable individual characteristics, unobservable individual characteristics and unobservable family

effects explain over one half of the variance in income and in wealth. This
poses a problem for policy arguments that are based on stochastic elements
dominating the distributions or on providing greater equality of opportunity
within which individuals can make choices.

Models of family allocational

28

rules,

ability, and socioeconomic rewards should accommodate two important

empirical results. First, we found that while unobservable Individual effects
were important determinants of both income and wealth distributions, they
are relatively more important determinants of the distribution of income.
Second, while we also found that unobservable family effects were important
determinants of both income and wealth distributions, they are relatively
more important in determining the distribution of wealth.
We have suggested at various points, that much of what we observe seems
to us to be consistent with an efficient investment—cum—compensatory transfer
allocational rule but our efforts do not provide a direct test of an allocational
model since none of our specifications are specifically constrained by such
a rule. Thus, the relatively more important family effect for wealth could

reflect either equal transfers within family where resources differed (including
time) between families or else compensating transfers such that sibling wealth
positions looked more alike than would be predicted from incomes.
We do suggest that permanent/transitory differences between wealth and

income may explain the larger family effect on wealth. This cannot be a complete
explanation, however, or we would expect that unobserved individual differences,
also

presumed to be more permanent, would also explain proportionally more

of the distribution of wealth than the distribution of income. Since this
is not the case, a more complex phenomenon is presumably generating the data
we have collected and analyzed.
