International evidence on well-being
David G. Blanchflower
NBER Working Paper No. 14318
September 2008
JEL No. I1,J0
ABSTRACT
National Time Accounting is a way of measuring society's well-being, based on time use. Its explicit
form is the U-index, for "unpleasant" or "undesirable", which measures the proportion of time an individual
spends in an unpleasant state. In this paper I review cross-country evidence on happiness and life satisfaction
and consider whether these data will likely be replaced by the U-index. I find that first, that there are
many similarities. According to both measures happiness is higher for the more educated, for married
people, for those with higher income and for whites and lower for the unemployed; is U-shaped in
age and un-trended over time in the USA although they are trended up in a number of EU countries
and especially so in developing countries. Equivalent results are found using self-reported unhappiness
data. Second, there is a large body of data on happiness that is unavailable on the U-index. For example,
according to happiness research well-being across nations is lower the higher is the unemployment
rate, the current inflation rate and the highest inflation rate in a person's adult life. Higher inequality
also lowers happiness. Third, we know little about the predictive power of the U-index. Happiness
and life satisfaction data seem able to forecast migration flows. Fourth, happy people are particularly
optimistic about the future. Fifth, according to the happiness data the US ranks above France but the
U-index suggests the reverse.

National Time Accounting (NTA) as propounded by Krueger, Kahneman, Schkade,
Schwarz and Stone (2007) - henceforth K2S3 – is a way of measuring society's well-being, based
on time use. It is a set of methods for measuring, comparing and analyzing the way people spend
their time, across countries, over historical time, or between groups of people within a country at
a given time. The arguments for NTA build on earlier work in Kahneman et al (2004a, b) and
Kahneman and Krueger (2006). K2S3 argue that NTA should be seen as a compliment to the
National Income Accounts, not a substitute. Like the National Income Accounts, K2S3 accept
that NTA "is also incomplete, providing a partial measure of society’s well-being". However,
national time accounting, as K2S3 note, "misses people’s general sense of satisfaction or
fulfillment with their lives as a whole, apart from moment to moment feelings" (p.4, 2007).
K2S3 propose an index, called the U-index (for “unpleasant” or “undesirable”) which is
designed to measure the proportion of time an individual spends in an unpleasant state. The first
step in computing the U-index is to determine whether an episode is unpleasant or pleasant. An
episode is classified as unpleasant by K2S3 if the most intense feeling reported for that episode is
a negative one -- that is, if the maximum rating on any of the negative affect dimensions is
strictly greater than the maximum of rating of the positive affect dimensions. Once they have
categorized episodes as unpleasant or pleasant, the U-index is defined by K2S3 as the fraction of
an individual’s waking time that is spent in an unpleasant state. The U-index can be computed
for each individual (what proportion of the time is this person in an unpleasant emotional state?),
and averaged over a sample of individuals. There does seem to be some differences in the paper
on how the U-index is actually calculated. For example, in K2S3's Table 5.2 the U-index is
defined as where 'stressed, sad or pain exceeded happy whereas in their Table 8.2 it is defined as
the 'maximum of tense, blue and angry being strictly greater than the rating of happy'.

1

It is apparent that K2S3 believe their index is an improvement on the use of data on life
satisfaction and happiness, which they suggest has a number of weaknesses. In Kahneman et al
(2004) these same authors have criticized the use of such data because they argue that, there are
(i) surprisingly small effects of circumstances on well-being (e.g., income, marital status, etc.);
(ii) large differences in the level of life satisfaction in various countries which they regard as
'implausibly large'. They go on to argue that,
"..reports of life satisfaction are influenced by manipulations of current mood and
of the immediate context, including earlier questions on a survey that cause
particular domains of life to be temporarily salient. Satisfaction with life and with
particular domains (e.g., income, work) is also affected by comparisons with other
people and with past experiences. The same experience of pleasure or displeasure
can be reported differently, depending on the standard to which it is compared and
the context." (Kahneman et al 2004, p. 430)
Indeed, Kahneman and Krueger (2006) argued that well-being measures are best described as
“… a global retrospective judgment, which in most cases is constructed only when asked and is
determined in part by the respondent’s current mood and memory, and by the immediate
context.” Frey and Stutzer (2005) have a rather different view.
"As subjective survey data are based on individuals’ judgments, they are, of
course, prone to a multitude of systematic and non-systematic biases. The
relevance of reporting errors, however, depends on the intended usage of the data.
Often, the main use of happiness measures is not to compare levels in an absolute
sense, but rather to seek to identify the determinants of happiness. For that
purpose, it is neither necessary to assume that reported subjective well-being is
cardinally measurable, nor that it is interpersonally comparable. Higher reports of
subjective well-being for one and the same individual has solely to reflect that she
or he experiences more true inner positive feelings" (2005, pp. 208-209).
In the same vein Di Tella and MacCulloch (2007) note, "one would expect that such small
shocks can be treated as noise in regression analyses". Consistent with this, however, Krueger
and Schkade (2007) have reported that
"..overall life satisfaction measures…exhibited test-retest correlations in the range
of .50-.70. While these figures are lower than the reliability ratios typically found
for education, income and many other common micro economic variables, they
are probably sufficiently high to support much of the research that is currently
being undertaken on subjective well-being, particularly in cases where group

2

means are being compared (e.g. rich vs. poor, employed vs. unemployed) and the
benefits of statistical aggregation apply" (2007, p.23).
In their earliest empirical analysis, Kahneman and Kruger (2006) calculated a U-index
using data from a sample of 909 working women in Texas and showed that those who report less
satisfaction with their lives spend a greater fraction of their time in an unpleasant state. Of the
respondents who reported they were 'not at all satisfied', 49% of their time was spent in an
unpleasant state, compared with 11% who said they were 'very satisfied'. The authors also found
that those who score in the top third on a depression scale spent 31% of their time in an
unpleasant state whereas those who score in the bottom third on the depression scale spent 13%
of their time in an unpleasant state. K2S3 extend this work and report a comparison of the Uindex based on data they collected in the US and France – and I understand that results from
Denmark are coming shortly. K2S3 sampled 810 women in Columbus, Ohio and 820 women in
Rennes, France, in the spring of 2005 and obtained information on both life satisfaction and their
U-index. The American women were twice as likely to say they were very satisfied with their
lives as are the French women (26 percent versus 13 percent). Furthermore, assigning a number
from 1 to 4 indicating life satisfaction also indicated that the Americans are significantly more
satisfied, on average. In contrast to reported life satisfaction, the U-index is 2.8 percentage
points lower in the French sample (16%) than in the American sample (18.8%). Thus, the
French, according to K2S3, appear to spend less of their time engaged in unpleasant activities
(i.e., activities in which the dominant feeling is a negative one) than do the Americans in their
samples. Moreover, national time-use data examined by K2S3 indicated that the French spend
relatively more of their time engaged in activities that tend to yield more pleasure than do
Americans.

The U-index relates to a relatively short period of time. Hence, there are a number of
things the U-index does not measure - it appears to miss more general factors likely to impact a
citizen's overall well-being. Examples, by country, include the fact that young people have been
rioting on the streets of Paris (the UK Daily Telegraph headline read 'Test for Sarkozy as Paris
riots continue', November 27th, 2007), the French soccer team has won the World Cup or the
English team has been knocked out of Euro 2008, or that the country is at war in Iraq and
Afghanistan, or there has been a terrorist attack or a hurricane or even forest fires in Malibu or
floods in New Orleans? These may well be missed by the U-index while likely being picked up
in happiness or life satisfaction measures which relate to a more general feeling of happiness. It
remains unclear whether an increase in unemployment, inflation or inequality or a decline in
growth, or a drop in the stock market or a rise in the possibility of recession the following year
would raise the U-index? Does the U-index predict the outcomes of elections or migration flows
or anything at all for that matter? As I will outline in more detail below, it certainly seems that
these factors impact our measures of well-being.
In what follows I provide a somewhat selective review of evidence on well-being using
cross-country data and try to provide a framework for reconciling the findings from this work
with those from the U-index. I present the main findings from responses on both happiness and
life satisfaction as well as on unhappiness, hypertension, stress, depression, anxiety and pain
from a considerable number of cross-country data sources. I also explore the results when
happiness questions are based on what happens over the preceding week and find slightly weaker
results. I then move on to look at how macro variables such as the national unemployment rate,
inflation and output impact life satisfaction. I find evidence that a one percentage point increase
in unemployment lowers happiness more than an equivalent increase in inflation and that the

4

highest level of inflation experienced as an adult lowers happiness further. Further, I show that
life satisfaction levels in East European countries predict flows of workers to the UK and Ireland.
Finally, I examine individual's expectations and show that happy people are particularly
optimistic about the future, both for themselves and the economy. Subjective well-being data are
clearly correlated with observable phenomena (Oswald, 1997).
1. Happiness and Life satisfaction
Data on happiness and life satisfaction in particular are now available for many countries
and for a large number of time periods. As with the U-index it is possible to average these
already existing data across individuals and countries to form a National Happiness Index (NHI)
to generate a measure national well-being, which would be a simple and cheap alternative to
K2S3's proposed NTA. A crucial question is whether or not K2S3's proposed U-index an
improvement over an NHI? As I lay out in detail below, there are many similarities between the
two indices in terms of their determinants. The main differences relate to country rankings.
Before presenting data on happiness and life satisfaction in seminars to the many skeptical
economists who don't believe you can, or even should, measure well-being – although there are
less of that ilk these days - I explain that the data have been validated by researchers in other
disciplines. I tell them that the answers to happiness and life satisfaction questions are well
correlated with a number of important factors (for references see Di Tella and MacCulloch,
2007).
1. Objective characteristics such as unemployment.
2. Assessments of the person’s happiness by friends and family members.
3. Assessments of the person’s happiness by his or her spouse.
4. Heart rate and blood-pressure measures of response to stress.

5

5. The risk of coronary heart disease
6. Duration of authentic or so-called Duchenne smiles. A Duchenne smile occurs when both the
zygomatic major and obicularus orus facial muscles fire, and human beings identify these as
‘genuine’ smiles (see Ekman, Friesen and O’Sullivan (1988) and Ekman, Davidson and Friesen,
(1990)).
7. Skin-resistance measures of response to stress.
8. Electroencephelogram measures of prefrontal brain activity.
Happiness and life satisfaction data are easy to obtain at the macro level as the data are
downloadable from the World Database of Happiness for over 100 countries. Most surveys now
use a common format for the questions. In general economists have focused on modelling two
fairly simple questions, one on life satisfaction and one on happiness. These are typically asked
as follows.
Q1. 3-step happiness – e.g. from the US General Social Survey (GSS)
"Taken all together, how would you say things are these days – would you say that you are very
happy, pretty happy or not too happy?"
Q2. 4-step life satisfaction – e.g. from the European Eurobarometer Surveys
"On the whole, are you very satisfied, fairly satisfied, not very satisfied, or not at all satisfied
with the life you lead?"
The micro data on happiness are easily obtainable from most data archives including ICPSR for
the GSS, the Data Archive at the University of Essex and ZACAT in Germany for the
Eurobarometers, ISSP, European Social Survey, BHPS, GSOEP, European Quality of Life
Survey, European Social Surveys etc.. Life satisfaction data are also now available annually
from the Latinobarometers while happiness data is available annually in the Asianbarometers
(Blanchflower and Oswald, 2007). Several of the data series extend back at least to the early
1970s. Many of the data sets cover several countries.

6

Economists like to run regressions, so by now the standard econometric approach taken by
economists is to use micro data on happiness and/or life satisfaction to estimate an ordered logit
or an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression with the coding such that the higher the number
the more satisfied an individual is (e.g. Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004). Generally, it makes
little or no difference if you use an OLS or an ordered logit. The results are similar – but not
identical – for happiness and life satisfaction.

The main, ceteris paribus, findings from

happiness and life satisfaction equations across countries and time are as follows.
Well-being is higher among:
Women
Married people
The highly educated
Active involvement in religion
The healthy
Those with high income
The young and the old – U-shaped in age
The self-employed
People with low blood pressure
The sexually active and especially those who have sex at least once a week
Those with one sex partner
Those without children
Well-being is lower among:
Newly divorced and separated people
Adults in their mid to late 40s
The unemployed
Immigrants and minorities
Those in poor health
Commuters
People with high blood pressure
The less educated
The poor
The sexually inactive
Those with children
There have been a number of recent surveys of the happiness literature including Clark et al
(2007); Frey and Stutzer (2002a, b) and Di Tella and MacCulloch (2006) which provide

7

discussions of the relevant issues. Recent findings from the statistical happiness research include
the following:
(i) For a person, money does buy a reasonable amount of happiness. But it is useful to keep this
in perspective. Very loosely, for the typical individual, a doubling of salary makes a lot less
difference than life events like marriage or unemployment.
(ii) For a nation, things are different. Whole countries, at least in the West where almost all the
research has been done, do not seem to get much happier as they get richer.
(iii) Happiness is U-shaped in age. Women report higher well-being than men. Two of the
biggest negatives in life are unemployment and divorce. Education is associated with high
reported levels of happiness even after controlling for income.
(iv) Happy people are less likely to commit suicide (Koivuma et al, 2001).
(v) The structure of a happiness equation has the same general form in each industrialized
country (and possibly in developing nations, though only a small amount of evidence has so far
been collected). In other words, the broad statistical patterns look the same in France, Britain
and the United States.

As Di Tella and MacCulloch note "well-being equations, (where

happiness and life satisfaction scores are correlated with the demographic characteristics of the
respondents) are broadly “similar” across countries, (is) an unlikely outcome if the data
contained just noise" (2007, p.9).
(vi) There is some evidence that the same is true in panels of people (that is, in longitudinal
data). Particularly useful evidence comes from looking at windfalls, like lottery wins.
(vii) There is adaptation. Good and bad life events wear off, at least partially, as people get used
to them.

8

(vii) Relative things matter a great deal. First, in experiments, people care about how they are
treated compared to those who are like them, and in the laboratory will even pay to hurt others to
restore what they see as fairness. Second, in large statistical studies, reported well-being depends
on a person’s wage relative to an average or ‘comparison’ wage including Blanchflower and
Oswald (2004); Ferrer-i-Carbonell (2005); Di Tella et al (2005) and Luttmer (2005). Third, wage
inequality depresses reported happiness in a region or nation (controlling for many variables),
but the effect is not large (Alesina et al, 2004). Some of these patterns are visible in raw data
alone. Strong correlations with income, marriage and unemployment are noticeable.
For the United States there seems to be relatively little evidence that despite rising
affluence, happiness or life satisfaction have trended up much over time (Blanchflower and
Oswald (2004). For example, in the 2006 GSS, 13.1% of respondents said they were not too
happy, 56.1% pretty happy and 30.8% very happy. In 1972, the first year happiness data are
available the numbers were 16.5%, 53.2% and 30.3% respectively. As can be seen from Figure
1, average happiness levels for the US are flat, while real GDP per capita has risen. It is also
apparent from Table 7.3 of K2S3 that their U-index based on time in various activities each year
is also flat over time.

The picture is rather more mixed among European countries. For example, in Figure 2a and 2b
there is some sign of a strong long-run upward trend in Italy and to a lesser extent in Denmark,
and France while the data are relatively flat in the Netherlands, Germany, the UK and Ireland. In
contrast, Belgium and Portugal have significant downward trends (results not reported). Note
that happiness levels are generally high in Denmark and low in Italy and France. In addition,
9

Frey and Stutzer (2002b) have shown that the time trend in life satisfaction in Japan was flat
between 1958 and 1991 over the period when GDP per capita rose by a factor of six.
There is evidence however of upward trends in Eastern European countries, Turkey and
South American countries over the recent past.

Table 1 reports the distribution of life

satisfaction scores for countries from Western and Eastern Europe and from Latin America over
the recent past. Among the seventeen Western European countries since the turn of the century,
five have seen satisfaction broadly flat (Denmark; Greece: Ireland; Spain and the UK); five have
seen increases (Belgium; Finland; France; Luxembourg and Sweden) while seven have seen
declines (Austria; Germany; Italy; Japan; Netherlands; Portugal and the USA). In contrast, with
the exception of Hungary, all of the Eastern European countries plus Turkey have all seen
increases as is the case for all the Latin American countries from 1997.1

There is some

consistent evidence also that the wellbeing of the young (<30) has risen over time in both the
USA and Europe (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2000). The rise is mostly among the unmarried.
We found that this upward trend is not explained by changing education or work, falling
discrimination or rise of youth-oriented consumer goods.
There is some evidence of convergence over time in the happiness of men and women in
the US as women have become less happy (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004a). Stevenson and
Wolfers (2007) find that the relative decline in women’s well-being holds for both working and
stay-at-home moms, for those married and divorced, for the old and the young, and across the
education distribution. The relative decline in well-being holds across various datasets, and for
whether one asks about happiness or life satisfaction.
1

Stevenson and Wolfers find that the

Easterlin and Zimmermann (2008) suggest that the observed increases in happiness in East Germany have arisen
following a noticeable drop in life satisfaction at the time of unification (Blanchflower, 2001), so the rise is largely a
recovery to pre-transition levels. In private communication Dick Easterlin has further suggested, based on his recent
work, that the collapse and recovery of life satisfaction is typically the case for the European transition countries.

10

exception is that this African-American women have become happier over this period as have
African-American men and there has been little consistent change in the gender happiness gap
among African Americans over this period. As with U.S. women, Stevenson and Wolfers find
that the well-being of European women has declined relative to men. However, while U.S.
women also experienced an absolute decline in well-being, the subjective well-being of
European men and women has risen over time.
There is also intriguing new evidence that high frequency happiness data yields
information about preferences. Kimball et al (2006), for example, showed that happiness dipped
significantly the first week of September 2005, after the seriousness of the damage done by
Hurricane Katrina started to become apparent. The dip in happiness lasted two or three weeks
and was especially apparent in the South Central region, closest to the devastated area.
2. The U-index

The first column of Table 2 is taken from K2S3 and reports their U-index, which should be
thought of as the inverse of a subjective wellbeing or happiness index. The higher the U-index
the more unhappy the person is. There is little difference by gender; blacks are especially
unhappy; the poor are unhappy as are the least educated. Unhappiness declines with age and is
particularly low for the married and high for the widowed. How do these findings compare with
those found using happiness and life satisfaction data? Column two presents the proportion of
people in the USA from the General Social Surveys of 2000-2006 who say they are very happy
(from a 1-3 scale) while in column 3 the proportion of Europeans from the 2000-2006
Eurobarometers saying they were very satisfied and in the final column for the 2005/2006
Latinobarometers who say they are very satisfied, both on a 1-4 scale, are reported.2 Here a
2

The countries covered in these Eurobarometers are Austria; Belgium; Bulgaria; Croatia; Cyprus; Czech Republic;
Denmark; Estonia; Finland; France; Germany; Greece; Hungary; Ireland; Italy; Latvia; Lithuania; Luxembourg;

11

larger proportion means happier and is the inverse of the U-index. Interestingly the results are
very similar in all four columns. Happiness is higher for the more educated, for married people,
for those with higher income and for whites.
Happiness does rise with age in the USA but once controls are included happiness is Ushaped in age (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2007b). It is U-shaped in age in both the European
and Latin American countries even in the raw data and when controls are included (Blanchflower
and Oswald, 2007b).3 This result is confirmed by K2S3 in their Table 7.4 where unhappiness
seems to follow an inverted U-shape.4 We explore this U-shape in age in more detail below.
The patterns across individuals are essentially the same then from SWB and NTA in the USA,
Latin America and Europe. It turns out that the happiness derived from sex in both SWB studies
and in U-index studies is especially high. (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004b) found that sexual
activity enters strongly positively in happiness equations.5 Indeed, in Kahneman and Krueger,

Malta; Netherlands; Norway; Poland; Portugal; Romania; Slovakia; Slovenia; Spain; Sweden; Turkey and the UK.
The Latinobarometer covers Argentina; Bolivia; Brazil; Colombia; Costa Rica; Chile; Dominican Republic;
Ecuador; El Salvador; Guatemala; Honduras; Mexico; Nicaragua; Panama; Paraguay; Peru; Uruguay and Venezuela.
3

As Clark (2007) notes, this finding is repeated in happiness equations in Blanchflower and Oswald (2004); Clark
(2005); Clark and Oswald (1994); Clark et al. (1996); Di Tella et al. (2001); Frey and Stutzer (2002a); Frijters et
al. (2004); Gerdtham and Johannesson (2001); Graham (2005); Helliwell (2003); Kingdon and Knight (2007);
Lelkes (2006); Oswald (1997); Powdthavee (2005); Propper et al. (2005); Sanfey and Teksoz (2007); Senik
(2004); Shields and Wheatley Price (2005); Theodossiou (1998); Uppal (2006); Van Praag and Ferrer-i-Carbonell
(2004) and Winkelmann and Winkelmann (1998).
4

Blanchflower and Oswald (2007b) find that a robust U-shape in age in happiness/life satisfaction is found in
seventy-two countries - Albania; Argentina; Australia; Azerbaijan; Belarus; Belgium; Bosnia; Brazil; Brunei;
Bulgaria; Cambodia; Canada; Chile; China; Colombia; Costa Rica; Croatia; Czech Republic; Denmark; Dominican
Republic; Ecuador; El Salvador; Estonia; Finland; France; Germany; Greece; Honduras; Hungary; Iceland; Iraq;
Ireland; Israel; Italy; Japan; Kyrgyzstan; Laos; Latvia; Lithuania; Luxembourg; Macedonia; Malta; Mexico;
Myanmar; Netherlands; Nicaragua; Nigeria; Norway; Paraguay; Peru; Philippines; Poland; Portugal; Puerto Rico;
Romania; Russia; Serbia; Singapore; Slovakia; South Africa; South Korea; Spain; Sweden; Switzerland; Tanzania;
Turkey; United Kingdom; Ukraine; Uruguay; USA; Uzbekistan and Zimbabwe.
5

Blanchflower and Oswald (2004b) found that higher income does not buy more sex or more sexual partners.
Married people have more sex than those who are single, divorced, widowed or separated. The happinessmaximizing number of sexual partners in the previous year is calculated to be 1. Highly educated females tend to
have fewer sexual partners. Homosexuality has no statistically significant effect on happiness.

12

(2006) and Kahneman et al (2004b), 'intimate relations' has the lowest rating (i.e. gives the most
happiness) while commuting has the highest. Somewhat surprisingly, though in K2S3 'walking'
gave more happiness than 'making love' among US women, although the reverse was the case
among French women (Table 8.3)!
In section 8 of their paper K2S3 do some international comparisons of SWB in two
“representative” cities, one in France and the other in the United States, and ask whether the
standard measure of life satisfaction and the NTA yield the same conclusion concerning relative
well-being. Specifically, they designed a survey to compare overall life satisfaction, time use,
and recalled affective experience during episodes of the day for random samples of women in
Rennes in France and Columbus, Ohio in the United States. These cities were selected because
they argued that they represented “middle America” and “middle France”. K2S3 also presented
results using time allocation derived from national samples in the United States and France to
extend their analysis beyond these two cities. The city sample consisted of 810 women in
Columbus, Ohio and 820 women in Rennes, France. Respondents were invited to participate
based on random-digit dialing in the Spring of 2005 and were paid approximately $75 for their
participation in both countries. The age range spanned 18 to 68, and all participants spoke the
country’s dominant language at home. The Columbus sample was older (median age of 44
versus 39), more likely to be employed (75 percent versus 67 percent) and better educated
(average of 15.2 years of schooling years versus 14.0) than the Rennes sample. In addition, the
Rennes sample was more likely to be currently enrolled in school (16 percent versus 10 percent).
The life satisfaction question was taken from the World Values Survey.
The distribution of reported life satisfaction in Columbus, OH and Rennes, France for
women found by K2S3 is presented in the first two columns of part A of Table 3a using the 4-

13

step life satisfaction scale. Life satisfaction is based on the question, ”Taking all things together,
how satisfied are you with your life as a whole these days - not at all satisfied, not very, fairly
and very satisfied?” K2S3 found that American women reported higher levels of life satisfaction
than the French did, whether the proportion who said they were very satisfied or the overall score
is used. Yet they also found that, on average, the French spent their days in a more positive
mood. Moreover, the national time-use data they used also indicated that the French spend
relatively more of their time engaged in activities that tend to yield more pleasure than do
Americans.

Their results, they argue, "suggest that considerable caution is required in

comparing standard life satisfaction data across populations with different cultures".

In

particular, the Americans seem to be more emphatic when reporting their well-being. The Uindex K2S3 suggests, "apparently overcomes this inclination".
Kahneman et al (2004 p. 430) have argued that differences in the SWB ratings of
Denmark and France, for example, in the Eurobarometers are implausibly large, and they "raise
additional doubts about the validity of global reports of subjective well-being, which may be
susceptible to cultural differences in the norms that govern self descriptions". For example, in
the Eurobarometers 2000-2006, the average distributions for life satisfaction for these two
countries are as follows.

Such differences are consistently repeated in multiple data sets, whether happiness or life
satisfaction is used. It is clearly problematic to compare one country’s happiness answers to
those of another country. Nations have different languages and cultures, and in principle that
may cause biases, perhaps large ones, in happiness surveys.

14

At this point in research on

subjective well-being, the size of any bias is not known, and there is no accepted way to correct
the data, although the literature has made some progress in exploring this issue (for instance, by
looking inside a nation like Switzerland at sub-groups with different languages). In the long run,
research into ways to difference out country fixed-effects will no doubt be done and the work of
K2S3 in this regard is obviously important.

The strong well-being performance in some

happiness surveys of countries such as Mexico and Brazil in the 2002 ISSP, for example,
(Blanchflower and Oswald, 2005), may or may not ultimately be viewed as completely accurate.
In Blanchflower and Oswald (2005), one check was done by comparing happiness in the English
speaking nations of Great Britain, Ireland, New Zealand, Northern Ireland and the United States.
The main attraction is that this automatically avoids translation problems.

Moreover, this

smaller group of nations has the advantage that they are likely to be more similar in culture and
philosophical outlook, and that in turn may reduce other forms of bias in people’s answers.
However, it does appear that there is considerable stability in cross-country rankings of life
satisfaction in English speaking countries (Blanchflower and Oswald, (2005, 2006); Leigh and
Wolfers, (2006)).
3. Econometric evidence on life satisfaction and happiness
As I will show in more detail below there is also a great deal of stability in the rankings
of European countries across a number of surveys including the Eurobarometers (1973-2006),
European Quality of Life Survey (2003) and the European Social Survey (2002). Further, it
seems that there is evidence from the World Values Survey and the International Social Survey
Programme (2002) supporting a happiness ranking where the US is ranked above France as
implied in K2S3's life satisfaction data rather than below it as implied by their U-index. In fact I
am unable to find any data file where the ranking reverses as occurs with the U-index. The

15

evidence is essentially the same whether we look at happiness, life satisfaction or health, family
life or conversely, a variety of measures of unhappiness including measures of high blood
pressure, stress, lack of sleep, pain and being 'down and depressed'.
Where feasible I present data comparing the US and France but there are only a few data
files that include both countries so we make use of data from a number of European data files
that allow a direct comparison with Denmark that will be included in K2S3's analysis shortly
plus the UK, which is of particular interest to this author! In almost all of what follows the UK
ranks above France: Denmark is mostly top of the happiness rankings in Europe, especially when
life satisfaction is used. If we refer to Figures 2a and 2b which are based on Eurobarometer
data, Denmark ranks above the UK which itself ranks above France, in every year of data we
have available. Indeed, based simply on life satisfaction averages France usually ranks below
the large majority of the EU15. For example, in the raw data from the latest Eurobarometer
available, #65.2 for March-May 2006, France ranked fourteenth out of thirty countries.6
Controlling for a variety of characteristics over a long run of thirty years, France ranked
seventeenth out of thirty.7
Columns 3-5 of part A of Table 3a report results using the most recent subset of the data
from the Eurobarometers for 2000-2006 which shows that France ranks third behind Denmark

6

Average life satisfaction scores were Denmark (3.61); Sweden (3.39); Luxembourg (3.39); Netherlands (3.36);
Ireland (3.28); Finland (3.23); UK (3.19); Belgium (3.19); Cyprus (3.12); Slovenia (3.10); Spain (3.08); Austria

(2.66); Lithuania (2.58); Latvia (2.56); Hungary (2.47); Portugal (2.44); Romania (2.31) and Bulgaria (1.97).

When an ordered logit is run using these Eurobarometer data from 1973-2006 pooled across all member countries
plus Candidate Countries Croatia, Norway and Turkey with a standard set of controls as in Table 8 column 5, the
rankings are as follows with rank in parentheses Denmark (1); Netherlands (2); Norway (3); Sweden (4);
Luxembourg (5); Ireland (6); UK (7); Finland (8); Belgium (9); Austria (10); Cyprus (11); Slovenia (12); Malta

(21); Portugal (22); Estonia (23); Greece (24); Slovakia (25); Latvia (26); Lithuania (27); Hungary (28); Romania
(29); Bulgaria (30);

and the UK. Part B of Table 3a presents data on women using the World Values Survey on a 10
point life satisfaction scale and replicates that ranking. Part C of the table uses data for men and
women combined from the World Database of Happiness and which includes all four countries.
Once again France ranks bottom, with Denmark second and the UK third with the USA at the
top.
In the final part of Table 3a I present some macro-economic data on GDP per capita, the
Gini coefficient and the most recent unemployment rate (Source; Labour Market Statistics First
Release, ONS, November, 2007).

In comparison with France the USA has a) a lower

unemployment rate, b) higher GDP per capita c) higher Gini coefficient. France has especially
high rates of long-term unemployment and youth unemployment. Denmark has an especially
low unemployment rate and low Gini coefficient. Despite the well known difficulty of making
suicide rates comparable across countries, it appears that the rates in France for both men and
women are well above those for the USA. This is illustrated in Table 3b. This ranking is more
consistent with SWB data rankings than it is with rankings based on NTA.
Happiness from a further source, the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP),
which also contains data from the two countries, is also supportive of the fact that happiness in
the USA is higher than it is in France. Data on the two countries are available in the 1998, 2001
and 2002 sweeps. In the first two sweeps happiness data is available on a four point scale in
response to the question 'how happy are you with your life in general – not at all happy; not very
happy, fairly happy and very happy'. Responses are as follows

The overall score for the French increased between 1998 and 2001. In the 2002 ISSP responses
were provided on a seven point scale and the US score is once again considerably higher than for
the French for both men and women. As can be seen below the average score across respondents
in the USA was higher for both men and women, however, the proportion very unhappy –
completely, very or fairly – was higher. For men in the USA 4.3% in this category compared
with 3.1% in France while for women the numbers were 4.2% and 3.6% respectively.

We now turn to the econometric evidence where we are able to hold constant a number of factors
including labor market and marital status, age, gender and schooling. The rankings remain
essentially unchanged.
Econometric evidence on the micro-determinants of happiness

18

Rank orderings of the United States and France are consistent whether we examine
happiness, life satisfaction or other variables relating to the family, no matter what the data file
or year we examine. Table 4a and 4b explores differences in happiness between the United
States and France using the ISSP 1998, 2001 and 2002 data described above.8 In all three years
of data the USA ranks above France, although there is some variation in the rankings across
other countries. For example, the UK is above the USA in 1998 and 2001 but below it in 2002
and above Denmark in all three years while Denmark is below France in 2001. In most other
data files we examine below Denmark ranks top in Europe, especially on life satisfaction.
Columns 3 and 4 provide estimates of ordered logits estimating how satisfied the individual is
with their family life. The idea here is to ensure the rankings are not driven by different
interpretations of the word 'happy', although still potentially impacted by the reticence of the
French to be emphatic when reporting their well-being. Rankings are similar to those based on
happiness, with Americans more satisfied than the French. It does seem, however, that people in
the USA value time with their families very highly. Interestingly, when individuals in the ISSP
are asked whether they wished they could spend more time with their families, more than half of
respondents reported they would like to spend 'much more time', compared with a third in France
and the UK and a fifth in Denmark (Table 5).
It is appropriate to explore further the ranking by country using the SWB measures from
other data files to see if the rankings are consistent and this is what is done in Tables 6-8 and it
turns out they are. Table 6 uses data from eighty two countries from the four sweeps of the
World Values Surveys of 1981-2004 on both life satisfaction and happiness. Ordered logits are

8

The exact question asked is Q.17. 'If you were to consider your life in general, how happy or unhappy would you
say you are, on the whole?' – 1=completely happy, 2=very happy, 3=fairly happy, 4=neither happy nor unhappy,
5=fairly unhappy, 6=very unhappy and 7=completely unhappy.

19

estimated in columns 1 and 2 with the dependent variable life satisfaction with responses scored
on a scale of 1-10 where 1 is least satisfied and 10 most satisfied. The sample size is just over a
quarter of a million observations - only three country dummies are included with the remaining
country dummies all excluded for simplicity. The first column only includes 19 year dummies
and country dummies for France, Denmark, the UK and the USA with all other countries set as
the omitted category for simplicity. Column 2 adds controls for age, gender, marital status and
labor market status. Happiness is higher among the married (Zimmermann and Easterlin, 2006),
the educated and especially low among unemployed (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004a, b). In
both columns the country ranking remains as follows - France, UK, USA and Denmark. In
columns 3 and 4 the dependent variable is a 4-step happiness variable and the rankings are a little
different - France, USA, UK and again Denmark at the top. These results are consistent with the
findings of Veenhoven (2000) who examined the first three waves of the WVS and found that
among the three possible ways of ranking countries based on responses of individuals on how
happy they are, how satisfied they are and how they would rate their lives on a scale from the
worst to the best possible life, the ranking stays roughly the same.
Table 7 uses data from another source, the European Quality of Life Study of 2003
(n=26,000), which obviously excludes the US, and follows a similar form but this time separate
results are reported on a 10-step scale for life satisfaction and happiness. Data are also available
on the individual's assessment of their overall health – on a five point scale: poor, fair, good,
very good and excellent. Four separate controls for health status are included in column 2 for
life satisfaction and column 5 for happiness along with a standard set of controls. Household
income in Euros is also available in the data file which is the added, in natural logarithms, in
columns 3 and 6. This is the first time in a cross-country data file on happiness that income has

20

been available in one currency (Euros). In all cases the rankings for the three main countries of
interest are France, then the UK and finally Denmark highest ranked. East European countries
have low levels of happiness (Blanchflower (2001), Sanfey and Teksoz (2007)); life satisfaction
and happiness is U-shaped in age, minimizing in the mid-40s for life satisfaction and in the 50s
for happiness. Adding controls for income lowers the age minimum. Happiness rises with
education and income whether health is controlled for or not. Married people and those living
together as well as those in good health are particularly happy. The unemployed are especially
unhappy (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004; Carroll, 2007 for Australia and Hinks and Gruen,
2007 and Powdthavee, 2007 for South Africa).
Money buys happiness. Interestingly, and perhaps surprisingly from an economist’s
point of view, the coefficients on the other variables in Table 7’s well-being equations hardly
alter when income is controlled for. The amount of happiness bought by extra income is not as
large as some would expect. To put this differently, the non-economic variables in happiness
equations enter with large coefficients, relative to that on income. Following Blanchflower and
Oswald (2004), Table 7, or its ordinary least squares equivalent (see Appendix Table A), can be
used to do a form of happiness calculus. The relative size of any two coefficients provides
information about how one variable would have to change to maintain constant well-being in the
face of an alteration in the other variable. To ‘compensate’ for a major life event such as being
widowed or a marital separation, it would be necessary to provide an individual with additional
income. Viewing widowhood as an exogenous event, and so a kind of natural experiment, this
number may be thought of as the ‘value’ of marriage. A different interpretation of this type of
correlation is that happy people are more likely to stay married. It is clear that this hypothesis
cannot easily be dismissed if only cross-section data are available. However, panel data on well-

21

being suggest that similarly large effects are found when looking longitudinally at changes (thus
differencing out person specific fixed effects). If high income goes with more happiness, and
characteristics such as unemployment and being black go with less happiness, it is reasonable to
wonder whether a monetary value could be put on some of the other things that are associated
with disutility. Further calculation using the life satisfaction data in Appendix Table A suggests
that to ‘compensate’ for unemployment compared with being a manual worker would take a rise
in net income of approximately €3,900 per month, which is very large given the mean in the data
of €1,392 and to ‘compensate’ for being married or living together would take €1,770 Euros
compared to being single.9 Blanchflower and Oswald (2004) also found large effects for the US
using the GSS data. These effects seem large and inconsistent with the claims of Kahneman et al
(2004) that the size of the effects of circumstances on well-being are, 'surprisingly small'.
Table 8 examines data from the 2002 European Social Survey (ESS) across 20 EU
countries plus Israel and Switzerland. Data are provided in columns 1-3 on happiness and life
satisfaction. The rankings are very similar to those reported in Table 7 – France then the UK
then Denmark at the top. The patterns in the data are similar to those identified above happiness and life satisfaction is higher for the most educated, for married people, the employed
and the healthy. Happiness and life satisfaction are U-shaped in age. Table 9 uses data from a
single Eurobarometer #57.2 on life-satisfaction (5-step) also with and without health status
dummies. There is a U-shape in age in every case. Once again in all six cases the rankings are
France then the UK and Denmark highest.

9

This is done simply by dividing the coefficient on unemployment by the coefficient on household income i.e.
.6847/.0001715=3903 Euros. The size of these effects is even higher using the happiness data i.e. 6420 Euros for
unemployment .

22

Identical rankings to this are found in Table 10 which uses over three quarters of a
million observations from a long time series of Eurobarometers on life satisfaction (4-step). The
rank ordering is France, UK and Denmark for the period 1975-2006 as well as for all subperiods. The rankings were also the same as this when thirty separate equations were run with
the same controls in every year individually (results not reported). It is also apparent from
Appendix Table B that the structure of (OLS) life satisfaction equations is similar across the
main European countries. Interestingly, the patterns of the life satisfaction appear to be very
similar to those in the happiness data in the United States.
Blanchflower and Oswald (2008b) found that psychological well-being is U-shaped
through life. A difficulty with research on this issue is that there are likely to be omitted cohort
effects (earlier generations may have been born in, say, particularly good or bad times). First,
using data on 500,000 randomly sampled Americans and West Europeans, the paper designs a
test that can control for cohort effects. Holding other factors constant, we showed that a typical
individual’s happiness reaches its minimum -- on both sides of the Atlantic and for both males
and females -- in middle age. Second, evidence was provided for the existence of a similar Ushape through the life-course in East European, Latin American and Asian nations. Third, a Ushape in age is found in separate well-being regression equations in 72 developed and developing
nations. Fourth, using measures that are closer to psychiatric scores, Blanchflower and Oswald
(2008b) document a comparable well-being curve across the life cycle in two other data sets: (i)
in GHQ-N6 mental health levels among a sample of 16,000 Europeans, and (ii) in reported

23

depression and anxiety levels among 1 million U.K. citizens.10 Evidence of a U-shape in age is
found in all life satisfaction and happiness equations reported in this paper.11
Easterlin (2006) argues that happiness in the US, as well as family satisfaction and job
satisfaction in the US follow an inverse U-shape in age.12

13

His evidence was based on data

from the General Social Surveys from 1973-1994. It is true in the raw data, or in specifications
that do not include income or marital status as controls, that there is an inverse U-shape in the
data in these three variables but only in the USA.14 However, once marital status alone is
included the U-shape flips and the sign of the time trend reverses, as can be seen below in the
two ordered logits with t-statistics in parentheses estimated on the GSS data from 1972-2006.15

Easterlin (2007) only includes controls for gender, education and year of birth and its square, and

Clark (2007) finds a similar result in the UK using data from the BHPS even after controlling for cohort effects.
See Tables 5-10 and 12.
However, Easterlin (2006) did find a U-shape in health and satisfaction with their financial situation .

13

Analogously Mroczek and Spiro (2005) found that subjective well-being follows an inverted U-shape peaking at
around retirement age.

14

If an ordered logit is run with each of these five variables along with only age and its square there is an inverse Ushape for happiness, family satisfaction and job satisfaction (workers only). There is a U-shape for the family's
financial situation while for the health variable only the age square term is significant and negative.

I estimated fourteen separate OLS equations for the largest European countries using the

1-4 with only age and its square as controls. Below we report signs of the variables if significant
at 1% on a two tailed test. If insignificant a zero is entered. In every country except Austria

When controls are included – for education, gender, marital status, labor market status and time –
in Appendix Table 1 all of these countries had significant U-shapes in age. Table 12a uses 5-step
happiness data for thirteen Asian countries for 2003 and 2004 drawn from the

16

I use a slightly different health variable than the one used by Easterlin (2007). I used health whereas Easterlin
used Sathealth, which was only available for a subset of years.

17

Health satisfaction declines with age in the raw data which is consistent with the findings of Deaton (2007) who
also found that health satisfaction declined with age.

25

Asianbarometers.18 The variables work in the same way as for other countries; and there are Ushapes in age with minima of 46 from column 3 for the two years pooled. However, there is no
U-shape in the raw data as was found in the USA. Analogously, simply adding marital status
variables generates a significant U-shape. Well-being is U-shaped in age whether measured by
life satisfaction, happiness or the U-index once controls are included and in many countries even
in the raw data. Cambodians and South Koreans are the least satisfied while those from Brunei
and Singapore the most satisfied.
Table 12b uses data on 5-step life satisfaction for nine Asian and 9 European countries
from the Asia/Europe Survey (ASES) of 2001. Happiness is U-shaped in age and rises with
education. The unemployed are especially unhappy in Europe but are also unhappy in Asia. In
both Asia and Europe native English speakers are especially happy – those with no
understanding of English at all are less happy. Swedes are especially happy and Portugueses
unhappy. There is a similar pattern to the Asian country dummies to those reported in Table 12a:
Koreans are especially unhappy and Malaysians and Singaporeans notably happy.
4. Econometric evidence on hypertension, unhappiness and pain
The question then is whether the pattern of results we have seen using happiness and life
satisfaction are repeated when we make use of self-reported data on unhappiness including high
blood pressure, being under strain, being unable to sleep, being tired, under stress and in pain. It
turns out that the results mostly go through. A modern literature has claimed that countries like
Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands are particularly happy while nations such as Germany,
Italy and Portugal are less happy. Yet it is arguably implausible that words such as ‘happiness’ or

18

The 5-step happiness scale is very unhappy; not too unhappy; neither; pretty happy and very happy. The raw
means by country were; Brunei 4.45; Cambodia 3.34; China 3.73; Indonesia 3.71; Japan 3.70; Korea 3.37; Laos
3.66; Malaysia 3.93; Myanmar 3.71; Philippines 3.82; Singapore 3.99; Thailand 3.88 and Vietnam 3.87.

26

‘satisfaction’ can be communicated unambiguously and in exactly the same way across
countries, so it is not easy to know whether such cross-national well-being patterns are
believable. Evidence on blood pressure across nations suggests that such happiness findings are
credible. This is illustrated in Table 13 which uses data from two individual Eurobarometers #56.1 for 2001 in columns 1-5 and a more recent one, #64.4 for December 2005-January 2006.
Column 1 of Table 13 reports an ordered logit estimating whether an individual has high blood
pressure from Blanchflower and Oswald (2008a) who showed that self-reported high blood
pressure across individuals and countries is negatively correlated with self-reported happiness.
Denmark ranks lowest on blood pressure and France highest. More recently Mojon-Azzi and
Sousa-Poza (2007) show that even with more objective measures of hypertension a negative
relationship between high blood pressure problems and life satisfaction can be observed. They
examined life satisfaction (scored in the normal way from 1-4, and self-reported blood pressure,
including whether the respondent took blood pressure medication, for a sample aged 50+ from
the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe. Their main results were as follows;
note that the correlation with life satisfaction was higher with taking medication (correlation=.79) than with self-reported high blood pressure (correlation =-.66).

Happy countries seem to have fewer blood-pressure problems. This has two implications. First,
it suggests that there may be a case to take seriously the subjective ‘happiness’ measurements
made across the world: they follow a pattern like the (inverse of) high-blood-pressure estimates.
Second, in constructing new kinds of economic and social policies in the future, where wellbeing rather than real income is likely to be a prime concern, there are grounds for economists to
study people’s blood pressure. The results on blood pressure validate the differences in happiness
across nations in part because people can report high blood-pressure in a more objective way
than they report levels of happiness;
The second column of Table 13, which is taken from Blanchflower and Oswald (2008a,
column 4, Table 5), estimates an OLS where the dependent variable is a measure of
psychological distress constructed (in the spirit of the well-known General Health Questionnaire
score) by amalgamating answers to the questions:
Have you recently:
1. Lost much sleep over worry?
2. Felt constantly under strain?
3. Felt you could not overcome your difficulties?
4. Been feeling unhappy and depressed?
5. Been losing confidence in yourself?
6. Been thinking of yourself as a worthless person?
To the answers to each of these six, we assigned the integers 0, 1, 2, 3 -- depending whether each
was answered not at all, no more than usual, rather more than usual, much more than usual.
The numerical answers were summed, and we term the result a ‘GHQ-N6’ measure, where N
stands for ‘negative’. The mental distress score denoted GHQ-N6, must for a person therefore
lie between 0 and 18. Across Europe, the mean of the variable is 3.6 (standard deviation 3.7).
These six are the 6 negative questions from the fuller General Health Questionnaire GHQ-12
measure of psychological distress. The data set does not provide data on the other six ‘positive’

28

questions. Thus our focus is upon negative affect. The rank ordering is the same once again France the most depressed, then the UK, and then Denmark the least depressed. Column 3 then
estimates an ordered logit with the dependent variable whether an individual reports whether
they feel 'unhappy or depressed'; column 4 models whether they 'had been feeling constantly
under strain' and column 5 refers to whether they had 'lost much sleep over worry'. The rankings
were once again in all cases France the most depressed and Denmark least depressed. Column 6
of Table 13 uses a different question from another Eurobarometer #64.4 for 2005/6 - the
respondent was asked whether during the preceding four weeks they had felt 'downhearted and
depressed'. Rankings were the same - France then the UK and then Denmark.
Atlas and Skinner (2007) examined the prevalence of pain in the US population using the
2004 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) for approximately 18,000 people aged 50+. Among
50-59 year olds, rates of pain ranged from 19 percent for male college graduates to 55 percent
among female respondents who did not finish high school. A variety of covariates in the HRS
such as occupation, industry, and marital status attenuated but did not erase these gradients.
Atlas and Skinner found differences across educational groups, with rates of people aged 50-59
troubled by pain ranging from 20 percent for men with a college education to 55 percent of
women who did not finish high school. Data from Eurobarometer #64.4 for 2006 allows us to
examine this issue across 31 European countries (n=28,000). Respondents were asked: 'During
the past four weeks how much if at all, has pain interfered with your activities? Extremely, quite
a lot, moderately, a little and not at all?'. The weighted percentage for the EU29 average
reporting 'quite a bit' or 'extremely' was as follows, by gender

The data here are consistent with those reported by Atlas and Skinner for the US - pain declines
with education. I find that pain rises with age in Europe for all levels of education, whereas
Skinner and Atlas found some evidence of that for the more educated but the reverse,
surprisingly, that pain fell with age from age 50 up for the least educated. Column 7 of Table 13
estimates an ordered logit and confirms that, ceteris paribus, pain declines with level of
education and rises with age and is lower for men. Countries with the highest amount of pain
were all from Eastern Europe (Poland; Slovakia; Latvia; Romania; Czech Republic; Lithuania;
Slovenia; Croatia; Bulgaria and Estonia).who all have low rankings on happiness and life
satisfaction equations (Tables 7 and 10).19 Countries with the least pain, in order, are Ireland and
the UK. The French report higher levels of pain than either the British or the Danes. Alongside
the evidence on hypertension the evidence from the incidence of pain does seem a further
validation of the findings from the SWB data rather than the U-index. It is difficult to believe
that data on pain and blood pressure are as susceptible to the K2S3 criticisms that the French are
less emphatic when reporting their well-being.20
There seems very clear evidence then that the patterns in both happiness and unhappiness
equations are remarkably stable across datasets, countries and however the question is asked.
They also appear to be broadly consistent in other attitudinal questions relating to the state of the
economy, government and even law and order. The evidence does seem to suggest dramatic
stability in the cross country rankings. Table 14 examines happiness and life satisfaction data as
19

I ran a happiness equation (how much of the time have you felt happy over the past four weeks - never, rarely,
sometimes, most of the time, all the time?) with the same dataset and the rankings of these countries out of 31 was
Poland (17); Slovakia (20); Latvia (30); Romania (24); Czech Republic (14); Lithuania (27); Slovenia (13); Croatia
(23); Bulgaria (31) and Estonia (29). The overall correlation between the country coefficients from the pain and
happiness equations was -.61.

20

In ongoing work Andrew Oswald and I have also found that pulse rates are also highly correlated with
(un)happiness scores. Indeed, the structure of a pulse equation is very similar to that of a GHQ score in terms of its
determinants. This work is being conducted using data from the English National Health Surveys of 1998-2007.

well as data on unhappiness from a recently available sweep of the European Social Survey of
2006/7. The broad structure of both the happiness and life satisfaction equations are as before –
U-shaped in age, higher for women, the more educated, the married, the healthy and the
employed. We also estimate an equation relating to the respondent's standard of living. The
structure of the unhappiness equations – here relating to depression, loneliness and anxiety –
have the inverse structure. The country rankings were as below – in all cases Denmark highest
(lowest) and France lowest (highest) for happiness and unhappiness respectively.

I explored responses to a number of other attitudinal variables relating to the respondent's wellbeing over the preceding week whereas the other questions, as Krueger and Schkade (2007)
suggest, "elicit a global evaluation of one’s life".21 Ordered logits were again estimated with the
same controls as in Table 14: once again they had a similar structure as above. For example, in
all cases happiness was U-shaped in age and unhappiness followed an inverted U-shape. In four
of the five 'happiness' questions, Denmark ranked higher than France while in four of the six
'unhappiness' questions Denmark also ranked lower than France. Countries below are ranked by
coefficient size positive to negative.

The rankings of countries when the questions relate to relatively short time periods such as a
week are somewhat different from those obtained when questions covering the respondent's life
more globally are examined. This seems more consistent with findings with the U-index that
relate to even shorter time periods.
5. The Macro-economics of Well-being
I have increasingly become interested in the well-being data in the role as a macro policy
maker. In the raw data happiness (and life satisfaction) is negatively correlated with
unemployment (Figure 3) and inflation (Figure 4). It also appears that happiness is positively
correlated with GDP growth (Figure 5 – taken from Leigh and Wolfers (2006)). When a nation
is poor it appears that extra riches raise happiness. However, income growth in richer countries
is not correlated with growth in happiness. This is the Easterlin hypothesis (Easterlin, 1974) and
is illustrated in Figure 6, which uses data from the 1995/2000 World Values Survey; the slope of
the function for western countries is approximately horizontal.
There is a small body of literature which uses SWB data across countries and through time
to estimate a 'misery index'. Di Tella, McCulloch and Oswald (2001, 2003) and Di Tella, and
MacCulloch (2007) use life satisfaction data to show that people are happier when both inflation
and unemployment are low. They all find that unemployment depresses well-being more than
does inflation. Di Tella and MacCulloch (2007) suggest that left-wing individuals care more

32

about unemployment relative to inflation than right-wingers. Wolfers (2003) has also shown that
greater macro volatility undermines wellbeing.
Table 15 uses aggregate life satisfaction data by country*year cell from the World
Database of Happiness, with the dependent variable the score on a 4-step scale. Results are
reported without a lagged dependent variable in columns 1 and 3 and with one added in columns
2 and 4, but this has little effect on the results. In columns 3 and 4, GDP per capita is added in
US dollars but is always insignificant once controls for unemployment and inflation are included.
The rank ordering of countries, once again is France, the UK, the USA with Denmark highest.
Both unemployment and inflation lower happiness.

A one percentage point increase in

unemployment has a larger impact than a one percentage point increase in inflation in all four
columns. If GDP per capita is included without controls for inflation or unemployment but with
country and year dummies it enters positively and significantly. If an additional term is included
where GDP is interacted with a poor country dummy the results were as follows with T-statistics
in parentheses.22

GDPt
GDP poor countryt

Without a lagged
dependent variable
.000016 (11.84)
.0000287 (6.46)

With a lagged
dependent variable
.00000247 (2.12)
.00000746 (2.14)

Both terms are significant and positive but the slope for the richer countries is less steep than
found for the poorer countries – there is diminishing marginal utility of income. This is the
Easterlin effect. This does suggest that rising GDP per capita raises happiness less for the
developed than for the developing countries which is consistent with the findings of Deaton
(2008) who argues that "it is not true that there is some critical level of GDP per capita above
22

'Poor' is defined here as having 2004 GDP per capita of <$20,000 which includes the Czech Republic ($6,263);
Hungary ($5,626); Italy ($19,506); Mexico ($6,006); Poland ($5,032); Portugal ($11090); Slovakia ($4,483) and
Spain ($15,403) with GDP per capita in $US in parentheses.

33

which income has no further effect on happiness" (2007, pp. 16-17). It is also consistent with
the findings of Helliwell (2003, p. 345) who uses data from the first three sweeps of the WVS
and finds that in a life satisfaction equation across countries "national average income also has
diminishing returns, since the logarithm of average per capita income takes a positive coefficient,
while the square takes a negative coefficient". This result is different from the findings of
Easterlin (1974, 1995) that happiness does not increase for long time spans despite large
increases in income. Consistent with this result is the fact that happiness levels for a number of
EU countries have increased over time. Indeed, in the pooled Eurobarometers 1973-2006 microdata files if we simply regress life satisfaction in an OLS on a time trend only there is a
significant upward trend in life satisfaction for ten countries - Denmark, the UK, France, Finland,
Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Italy. There is a negative trend for
Portugal, Germany and Belgium and no significant trend for Austria and Greece.23
Table 16 uses micro data on over 700,000 individuals from fifteen countries for which I
have long time series of inflation data back to the 1950s (Austria; Belgium; Denmark; Finland;
France; Germany; Greece; Ireland; Italy; Netherlands; Norway; Portugal; Spain; Sweden and the
UK) drawn from the Eurobarometers from 1973-2006 and reported in Blanchflower (2007). As
in Table 15 which uses macro data, controls are included for the unemployment rates and the
inflation rate, but here standard errors are clustered at the country*year cell. Once again both
macro variables enter negatively and the ranking is Denmark, UK and finally France the lowest.
Column 2 adds the variable reflecting the average annual inflation experience of each individual
in our sample given their age, country, and year the life satisfaction survey was conducted; this

23

Data are available from 1973-2006 for Belgium, France, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg,
Netherlands and the UK. For 1981-2006 for Greece, 1985-2006 for Portugal and Spain and from 1995-2006 for
Austria, Finland and Sweden.

term is insignificant. Column 3 substitutes the average annual experience term, for the highest
annual inflation rate experienced by each individual over their adult life. This term is negatively
signed and significant, and its inclusion has essentially no effect on either the coefficients on
inflation or unemployment. An individual who has experienced high inflation in the past has
lower happiness today, even holding constant today’s inflation and unemployment rates.
Unemployment appears to be more costly than inflation in terms of its impact on wellbeing. In
Blanchflower (2007) I used these data to estimate a misery-index which measures the relative
effect of a one percentage point increase in unemployment compared with a one percentage point
increase in inflation. The estimates imply individuals weight the loss from unemployment 1.6
times more than the loss in well-being from inflation.24 Columns 4 and 5 of the table provide
separate estimates for those under forty and those ages 40 and older. Interestingly, for the
younger group the misery index is close to 1.4, whereas for the older group it is approximately
2.1, while the size of the loss of happiness for the unemployed is similar.25 Interestingly, the
highest inflation term, which is negative and significant in both cases, is much larger in size in
the former case although its mean is much lower (20.2 and 116.2 respectively).
In Table 17 I explore the impact of the macro-economy on individual happiness and life
satisfaction using self-reported views on unemployment, inflation and inequality using data from
three recent Eurobarometers from 2006 and 2007. The results are very similar to those based on
24

The misery-index is calculated in Blanchflower (2007) as the coefficient on the unemployment rate plus the loss
for the unemployed themselves, divided by the coefficient on the inflation rate. The loss to the individual from being
unemployed can be calculated from the coefficient on being ‘unemployed’ in a life-satisfaction micro regression,
like the one reported in column 1 of Table 11, estimated with OLS to keep the units consistent – we get -.3657. The
entire well-being cost of a 1 percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate is therefore given by the sum of
two components. Combining the two, we have .0114 + .0036= .0147 as society’s overall wellbeing cost of a one
percentage point rise in the unemployment rate divided by .0094. The implication is that the wellbeing cost of a 1
percentage point increase in the unemployment rate equals the loss brought about by an extra 1.56 percentage points
of inflation.

Calculated as (.0102+.0036)/.0109=1.27 and (.0128+.0039)/.0081=2.06 respectively.

35

using the macro data; we also have evidence that inequality lowers happiness. In the first column
the results from estimating a series of ordered logits are reported with four-step happiness as the
dependent variable. In addition to the standard controls of labor market and marital status,
schooling, gender, age and country dummies plus a number of additional controls not available
in other data files. First, if the respondent is a member of a minority group as well as if they are
not part of the majority but do not associate themselves with a particular group: both enter
significantly and negative with the effect three times larger for minorities. Second, controls are
included to distinguish whether they owned their house outright or with a mortgage, which both
enter significantly positive.

Third, I include a control identifying whether the respondent

belonged to a religious organization which also is significant and positive. Fourth, following Di
Tella and MacCulloch (2005) and Alesina et al (2004) I include controls for an individual's
political views on a scale from 1 (Left) to 10 (Right) and show that right wingers are happiest.
Finally, I include three variables based on an individual's response to a question asking what
topics "worry you the most"? I include responses relating to unemployment, inequality and the
cost of living (inflation); multiple responses are possible. Unemployment and inflation lowers
happiness as does inequality following Alesina et al (2004) and Blanchflower and Oswald
(2004). Column 2 uses data from Eurobarometer #66.1 which uses a four-step life satisfaction
dependent variable confirms that both unemployment and inflation lowers pay – information on
inequality is available in that survey.26
Column 3 also uses a four-step data on life satisfaction from a 2007 Eurobarometer #67.2
with slightly different attitudinal questions. Once again the unemployed have lower life
satisfaction,\; happiess is U-shaped in age, higher for the married and for those who own their

Similar results are also found using Eurobarometer #64.1 but which does not contain details of home ownership.

own house and especially high in Denmark and low in Bulgaria. The main difference in column
3 is that now the macro controls relate to whether the respondent believes that inflation is lower
than, equal to or higher than it was a year earlier. Once again happiness is lower when the
respondent reports that inflation or unemployment is higher. Unemployment, inflation and
inequality all appear to lower happiness and life satisfaction.
6. Predictions and expectations
I recall John Abowd saying to me at a very early seminar given at the NBER, that the
crucial test for the happiness data is whether or not it has any predictive power. Little work has
so far been done on this question, but in some recent work I found that life satisfaction levels in
Eastern European countries is a good predictor of migration flows to the UK. On May 1st 2004
to the so called A8 accession countries (the Czech Republic; Estonia; Hungary; Latvia;
Lithuania; Poland; Slovakia; and Slovenia) joined the European Union.27 Citizens from the A8
nations obtained free movement and the right to work in the UK, Ireland and Sweden from May
1st 2004.28 Gilpin et al (2006) examined data for the UK drawn from the Worker Registration
Scheme, which registers the A8 workers, and computed the number of WRS registrations as a
percentage of the home country population and show it is correlated with GDP and
unemployment. Gilpin et al. found that countries with the lowest GDP per head, such as
Lithuania (2,500 Euros) are more likely to be registered on the UK WRS than those from
countries with higher GDP, such as Slovenia (11,400 Euros).29 The propensity to migrate is even

27

In addition Malta and (South) Cyprus also joined the EU at that date. Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU on
January 1st 2007.

28

Finland, Greece, Portugal and Spain opened their labour markets to these workers on May 1st 2006, while Italy
followed in late July 2006. Five other countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands and Luxembourg)
alleviated restrictions in 2006 (Zaiceva, 2006).

29

Expressed as Euros per inhabitant at 1995 exchange rates and prices.

37

more highly correlated with life satisfaction than it is with GDP per capita (Blanchflower and
Shadforth, 2007).
Of interest is whether life satisfaction or happiness is correlated with people's
expectations of the economic situation. It turns out that they are. Respondents in thirteen
separate Eurobarometers for the period 1995-2006 were asked the following questions.
"What are your expectations for the next twelve months: will the next twelve
months be better; worse or the same when it comes to a) your life in general
b) the economic situation in (our country) c) the financial situation of your
household d) the employment situation in (our country) d) your personal job
situation?".
Data are available on 15 countries for all twelve years (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland,
France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden
and the UK). Data for the fifteen Accession and Candidate countries (Republic of Cyprus;
Czech Republic; Estonia; Hungary; Latvia; Lithuania; Malta; Poland; Slovakia; Slovenia;
Bulgaria; Romania; Turkey; Croatia and Cyprus (Turkish Cypriot Community) are present for
only 2004-2006. In eight separate surveys respondents were also asked about their expectations
for themselves ten years hence - "In the course of the next five years, do you expect your
personal situation to improve, to stay about the same or get worse?". Life satisfaction is further
reported in a subset of these surveys. We examine three of these responses here.
Table 18 reports results of estimating ordered logits for parts b), d) and a) as well as for
life five years ahead. The dependent variable is coded as one if the response was 'worse', 2 if 'the
same ' and 3 if 'better', so positive coefficients should be interpreted once again as suggesting the
variable raises the probability of life improving. Column 1 and 2 of Table 18 relates to the
individual's views on the economic situation, columns 3 and 4 to the employment situation and
columns 5 and 6 to their life over the following twelve months and columns 7 and eight for life

38

over the following five years. In each case separate results are provided with and without three
life satisfaction controls derived from the standard 4 category life satisfaction variable.
Happiness enters significantly and positively in each of these equations. This is similar to
findings by Guven (2007) who found using data from the Netherlands and Germany that
happiness increases savings, decreases expenditures, and the marginal propensity to consume is
lower for the happy people. Happy people, Guven also found, are a) more risk averse in
financial decisions b) expect to live longer c) are more concerned about the future than the
present d) expect lower prices in the future e) are less likely to smoke and f) do not desire to
move within a country.30
There is a common pattern in the control variables across all eight specifications.
Optimism 1) rises with educational attainment 2) is U-shaped in age 3) is lower for married and
widowed, the unemployed and is higher the greater the level of current happiness. The country
ranking in relation to people's views on the economic and employment situations is once again
France, UK and then Denmark. The British, though are especially optimistic that their life will
improve and the Danes now less optimistic than the French. Happier people, it turns out, are less
pessimistic about the state of the economy as well, unsurprisingly, about how their life will
proceed. These country rankings are consistent with the evidence from the ESS 2002 reported in
Table 8 above respectively, where the respondents report on their current views on the economy,
government and democracy.

30

Guven (2007) examined data on prices only for the Netherlands using data from the Dutch National Bank (DNB)
Household Survey which is a panel of about 4500 individuals from 1993 to 2006. Data on price expectations are of
particular interest to macro-policy makers. Guven found that happier people expect lower prices than unhappy
people for the next year and also in five years time. Questions asked were 1) “Do you expect prices in general to
rise, to remain the same, or to go down, in the next 12 months? 1=go down 2= remain the same 3= rise” 2) “By what
percentage do you expect prices in total to have risen after 5 years?”

39

Interestingly, respondents seem more optimistic about their own lives than they are about
the economy or the employment situation in their country. For example, in the UK respondents
are twice as likely to report that they think their own situation will improve, than think that either
the economic situation or the employment situation of the country will improve. Moreover, the
trend in the former is up, while the trend in the latter is down. The proportion of UK respondents
saying that the situation in 12 months will be 'better' for the economic and employment situations
and their life in general over the next twelve months is set out in Table 19. Annual percentage
point (pp) changes in the unemployment and inflation rates are also shown. There is some
evidence that respondents’ expectations about the wider economic and employment situation in
the Eurobarometers are well correlated with actual (t+1) macro outturns as can be seen below.
Correlation matrix:

Figure 7a plots the proportion of respondents in the Eurobarometers who say they expect
the economic situation in the next twelve months in the UK to 'improve' (inverted) against
changes in both the unemployment rate and the inflation rate.

The responses to how the

economic situation is expected to develop is also highly correlated with other surveys of
economic confidence, such as the GfK and MORI measures of general economic confidence for
the coming twelve months which use the same questions. The correlations are .73 and .85
respectively as shown in Figure 7b. Macro-economic variables appear to impact individual’s
expectations about their own lives and what they expect to happen to the economy as a whole, as
does their current levels of happiness.
7. Conclusions

40

There are broadly consistent patterns in the SWB micro-data no matter what data file is
used, no matter which country - perhaps excluding the poorest countries with low life
expectancy. Results using data on well-being seem very similar to the results obtained from
NTA - and potentially more stable as sample sizes are often large. Happiness appears to be a) Ushaped in age, b) higher for the most educated c) the higher paid, d) non-minorities e) the
employed and f) for married people.

Analogous results are found using self-reported

unhappiness data. However, when such questions are asked in relation to the week prior to
interview the country rankings are quite different and seem more consistent with findings with
the U-index that relate to fifteen minute intervals.
Responses on blood pressure and pain appear to validate the happiness and life satisfaction
data as they are likely less subject to any cultural and language differences which might arise, for
example, if the French are less emphatic when reporting their well-being. Happy people and
happy countries seem to have fewer blood-pressure and pain problems.
There are long consistent time runs of data available for macro-economic analysis dating
back to the early 1970s. Well-being across nations is correlated with the unemployment rate, the
current inflation rate and the highest inflation rate in a person's adult life as well as GDP growth
rates especially in poorer countries.

Happiness and life satisfaction data help to forecast

including migration flows. Happy people are particularly optimistic about the prospects for the
economy.
There are a number of SWB measures that can and already are being used in one form or
another as an NHI. These seem to correlate strongly with other macro measures including the
unemployment rate, the inflation rate, and even the suicide rate. The simplest and most widely
available SWB measure is apparently the 4-step life satisfaction index which is already available

41

in similar form in ongoing annual surveys for all EU countries collected by the EU Commission
as well as in most Latin American countries. The fact that so much harmonized cross-country
data are already available of this type is the singular attraction for this one measure. The one
country where suitable data are unavailable is the United States, although 3-step happiness data
have been available for many years in the General Social Surveys, which is quite small in size
and now only collected bi-annually.31 I recommend that a 4-step life satisfaction plus a 3-step
happiness question as soon as possible are included at regular intervals in one or more large
national surveys in the US such as the Current Population Survey. The CPS is an obvious place
to include it as it could be asked on more than one occasion to the same individual perhaps in the
first and last rotation groups which would permit panel data analysis to be done over time for the
same individuals. Such work has been possible in the UK using the BHPS and in Germany using
the GSOEP but not to my knowledge in the USA. This needs to change.
Work on NTA appears to be an important complement to this work, but the 4-step life
satisfaction NHI in my view should be its starting point. Obviously nations have different
languages and cultures, and in principle this may cause biases in happiness surveys. K2S3 have
identified that there appears to be a bias when comparing results from France with those from the
US. They found that, on average, the French spent their days in a more positive mood and more
of their time engaged in activities that tend to yield more pleasure than do Americans. The
Americans seem to be more emphatic when reporting their well-being. Despite this, there are
considerable similarities between the findings from the U-index and those from happiness and
life satisfaction data. We are all trying to get utility proxy data for the u in the conventional
utility function u(y), and in principle this is complementary to normal economics, not a rival to

31

The World Database of Happiness does report data on 4-step life satisfaction (see Table 1) for the USA drawn
from a number of small Gallup polls for the years 1991, 1997 and 2002-2004.

42

it. 'Happiness data' no doubt have weaknesses but it seems unlikely they contain no useful
information. A standard equation structure has now been replicated hundreds of times in a large
number of nations, so we need to get to the bottom of it. Plus income comes in positive and
concave; inflation and unemployment hurt; etc; and all this seems to make sense to economists.
There are thus interesting regularities in wellbeing data. Whatever they mean, and whatever
criticisms one might have of such data, it seems worth economists and others attempting to
understand why these patterns exist.

It is good scientifically if rather different subjective

wellbeing measures give similar equation structures. They seem to.
A big question going forward is how to incorporate the findings from national time use
with those from the subjective well-being literature. Of interest will be whether there are
differences, for example, between countries who speak the same language such as the UK,
Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Are there significant differences between the results
obtained from NTA and SWB in other countries besides the US and France? If happiness is Ushaped in age, to what extent is the time use of the young different from that of the old? What is
it that makes people unhappy in middle-age? Nations have different languages and cultures, and
in principle that may cause biases, perhaps large ones, in happiness surveys. At this point in
research on subjective well-being, the size of any bias is not known, and there is no accepted
way to correct the data, but progress is being made. NTA and SWB appear to be complements
rather than substitutes. There is still much work to be done.

Notes: The dependent variable in column 1 is a measure of reported problems of high blood-pressure. The question that forms the dependent variable is,
“Would you say that you have not at all, no more than usual, rather more than usual, much more than usual...had problems of high blood pressure?” where 1=not
at all; 2=no more than usual; 3=rather more than usual; 4=much more than usual. The dependent variable in column 2 is a psychological distress score measured
on a scale from 0 to 18. A GHQ-N6 score amalgamates answers to six questions: Have you recently: Lost much sleep over worry? Felt constantly under strain?
Felt you could not overcome your difficulties? Been feeling unhappy and depressed? Been losing confidence in yourself? Been thinking of yourself as a
worthless person? Its mean in the sample is 3.6 (s.d. =3.7). The dependent variable in columns 3-5 are in order a) column 3 = 'Would you say that you have not at
all, no more than usual, rather more than usual, much more than usual...been feeling unhappy and depressed?' b) column 4 = 'Would you say that you have not at
all, no more than usual, rather more than usual, much more than usual... been feeling constantly under strain?' c) column 5 = 'Would you say that you have not at
all, no more than usual, rather more than usual, much more than usual.. 'Would you say that you have not at all, no more than usual, rather more than usual, much
more than usual... 'lost much sleep over worry?'
Personal controls are also included in columns 1-5 are 10 dummy variables relating to the individual's experiences before the age of 18; 16 labour-force status
dummies; and 8 marital-status dummies. Belgium is the excluded nation.
The dependent variable in Column 6 models the following question 'These questions are about how you feel and how things have been with you during the past 4
weeks. For each question, please give the one answer that comes closest to the way you have been feeling...How much of the time during the past 4 weeks have
you felt downhearted and depressed? All the time, most of the time, sometimes, rarely, never. In column 7 the question is 'During the past four weeks how
much if at all, has pain interfered with your activities? Extremely, quite a lot, moderately, a little and not at all? In empirical estimation we reversed the ordering.
Personal controls included in columns 6 and 7 are 16 labour-force status dummies; and 8 marital-status dummies. Belgium is the excluded nation. T-statistics
are in parentheses.
