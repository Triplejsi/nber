Trades of the Living Dead: Style Differences, Style Persistence and Performance of Currency
Fund Managers

NBER Working Paper No. 14355

JEL No. F31,G11,G15
ABSTRACT
We make use of a new database on daily currency fund manager returns over a three-year period, 2005-08.
This higher frequency data allows us to estimate both alpha measures of performance and beta style
factors on a yearly basis, which in turn allows us to test for persistence. We find no evidence to support
alpha persistence; a manager's alpha in one year is not significantly related to his alpha in the prior
year. On the other hand, there is substantial evidence for style persistence; funds that rely on carry,
trend or value trading or with a long/short bias toward currency volatility are likely to maintain that
style in the following year. In addition, we are able to examine the performance of managers that survive
through the entire sample period, versus those that drop out. We find significant differences in both
the investment styles of living versus deceased funds, as well as their realized alpha performance measures.
We conjecture that both style differences and ineffective market timing, rather than market conditions,
have impacted performance outcomes and induced some managers to close their funds.

Trades of the Living Dead: Style Differences,
Style Persistence and Performance of Currency
Fund Managers

1. Introduction
A large number of academic and professional studies support the notion that various
types of currency trading strategies can be quite profitable.1 Knowing that currency
alpha can be easily transported into a wide range of investment products, the asset
management industry is naturally very interested in currency as an asset class.

However, recent performance of currency managers has been disappointing. For
example, both the Parker FX index and the Barclay Currency Traders Index (BCTI),
which track the performance of currency managers, have underperformed cash (risk
free returns) over the three years ending March 2008 (see Table 1).2 Performance
over a three-year term is an important measure as it sometimes is associated with the
“average life” of an investment mandate.3

In part, these lacklustre returns may reflect the disappointing performance of various
well-known currency strategies such as carry trading, trend following, and value
1

Research has focused on three types of trading strategies. The carry trade or forward rate bias strategy
relies on the general tendency for currencies with high interest rates to appreciate. See Froot and Thaler
(1990) for a survey and Burnside, et al. (2006) for a recent study. Technical trend following strategies
rely on persistent movements in spot exchange rates. See Irwin and Park (2007) and Neely, Weller and
Ulrich (2007) for surveys. Value investing strategies based on mean reversion to long run PPP
exchange rates offer another approach. Studies prepared at Citibank (2003) and Deutsche Bank (2007)
suggest that simple value trading strategies have been profitable.
2
Some alternative currency managers’ indices (the CTA Equal Weighted Currency Index and the CTA
Asset Weighted Currency Index prepared by the Centre for International Securities and Derivatives
Markets) show a positive return over this period. Nevertheless, opinion in the currency management
industry remains strong that average returns have been poor in this period.

investing. Figure 1 shows the performance of three examples of these currency
trading strategies for the three years between April 2005 and March 2008. The carry
strategy showed essentially zero return over the first 18 months, and then exhibited a
strong run up until June 2007. But carry has given back its gains since the U.S. credit
crunch began in summer 2007. As expected, the spike in currency volatility (Figure 2)
coincides with the underperformance of carry trades. Returns from trend following
moved mostly sideways throughout the period, although trend started to perform well
in 2008. The value trading strategy oscillated between 100 and 110 but closed the
period as the worst performing strategy of the three with a slightly negative return.
This may not be a surprise given the climb in the spot EUR/USD rate towards 1.60,
presumably further away from its “fair” value.

In earlier research, Pojarliev and Levich (PL, 2008) show that a significant part of the
variation of the returns of professional currency managers can be explained by these
three trading strategies and an indicator of currency volatility. PL redefine the alpha in
currency management as only that portion of the excess returns which can not be
explained by these four factors. In this paper, we take a closer look at the returns of
professional currency managers by estimating their alpha performance measures and
style betas over successive annual intervals. We are interested in the following
questions: First, is past performance any indication for future performance (are alphas
persistent)? Second, are investment styles (beta exposure) persistent? Third, what
differences in performance are there between funds that survive throughout the
sample period and those that do not? And finally, what explains difference in
performance between funds that survive and those that do not?
3

Recently, Gross (2005) suggests that three to four years is the “average life” of investment firms, i.e.
the time frame before an average client will leave if performance disappoints.
3

To address these questions, we rely on data for 80 currency managers for three years
between April 2005 and March 2008. We estimate alpha performance measures and
style betas using the four factor model proposed in PL (2008). We use higher
frequency, weekly return data to obtain efficient parameters estimates for annual
periods. Moreover, our database includes “dead funds” which allows us to correct for
backfill and survivorship bias, and examine differences between living and deceased
funds.

Overall, the results are quite interesting. We find no alpha persistence. Past
performance by an individual manager seems to offer no indication for his future
performance. However, we detect significant style persistence indicating that
managers have a tendency to stick to the same investment style (or strategy). This
may be good as it raises investor confidence that managers will stick with their
original or mandated strategy. But at the same time, persistence suggests that
managers are less willing to exploit market timing or reallocate their positions when
other strategies look more promising. Because consultants usually “penalize”
managers who do not stick to the same investment style, some style persistence may
be an attempt by managers to enhance credibility with investment consultants.

We also find some important differences between managers who perform well (and
survive) versus managers who perform poorly (and drop out of the database). Not
surprisingly, the set of funds that died over our sample achieved a significant negative
alpha and an alpha significantly less than for funds that survived until the ending date.
Moreover, the surviving or live funds showed greater association (in terms of R-

4

squared) with the four style factors than those funds that performed poorly and
eventually died. Furthermore, contrary to the presumption of the market that
underperformance of the trend-following rule has been responsible for the
diminishing returns of professional currency managers, we find that the strong
performance of the carry strategy until the credit crunch in the summer of 2007 was
devastating for many managers, who apparently were betting on liquidation of carry
trades.

In the next section of the paper, we lay out our methodology for relating currency
fund returns to style factors and describe the data in our study. In section 3, we report
our empirical evidence on currency fund performance over the entire three-year
period for indices constructed to represent various groups of managers, including
those who survive through the entire data sample (the “live” funds) and those who
drop out (the “dead” funds). In section 4, we examine the empirical evidence for
individual managers over the three-year period and over one-year intervals and report
our results for persistence in alpha (i.e. performance) and persistence in beta (i.e.
style). Conclusions and implications of our findings are in the final section.

2. Methodology and Data Description
To measure the systematic components of currency returns (the betas) and isolate the
portion due to skill, we follow the approach used in PL (2008) and adopt a standard
factor model of the form:

Rt = α + ∑i β i Fi ,t + ε t

(1)

where
R is the excess return generated by the currency manager, defined as the total
return ( Rt* ) less the periodic risk-free rate ( RF , t )

α is a measure of active manager skill,
F is a beta factor, that requires a systematic risk premium in the market,
β is a coefficient or factor loading that measures the sensitivity of the
manager’s returns to the factor, and
ε is a random error term.
To implement this approach, we require data on currency manager returns and factors
that proxy for types of trading strategies and exposures that currency managers would
be likely to utilize. Our empirical proxies for these factors are based on data for the
major currencies that make up the vast bulk of foreign exchange trading volume.4

Currency Manager Returns
In this study, we aim to estimate alphas of currency managers over annual periods.
Thus, using monthly data is not an option as twelve observations are not enough to
obtain robust estimates. It is challenging to obtain higher frequency data for the
returns of professional currency managers as hedge fund data providers usually

6

collect monthly performance data. In this study, we make use of a new database of
currency managers who are part of the Deutsche Bank (DB) FXSelect platform.5
Launched in March 2005, FXSelect is an open platform, which allows clients of
Deutsche Bank to allocate their funds to different currency managers. Any currency
manager can apply for registration in the platform and be accepted if he satisfies the
following criteria:

a) Managers must be able to provide a daily track record for at least the last 18
months verified by a third party
b) They cannot have had more than a 20% draw-down of assets under management
over the last 12 months
c) Assets under management must be at least 15 million USD
d) Satisfactory criminal and regulatory searches on key individuals

While FXSelect is a new venture, the platform is presumably an attractive means for
professional currency managers to enhance their visibility and grow their client base.
As such, we believe that the FXSelect data offer a fair means of assessing
performance in the currency management industry.6 Most importantly for this study,
daily returns data on the FXSelect platform are available, thus providing us with
sufficient data to conduct an analysis of 12-month periods.

4
The April 2007 survey of global foreign exchange turnover conducted by the Bank for International
Settlements in 2007 shows that the G10 currencies accounted for an average 90.1% of all currency
turnovers.
5
We are grateful to Neville Bulgin and Rashid Hoosenally from Deutsche Bank for supplying the data.
More information about FXSelect can be find in the brochure “FXSelect: An Asset Allocation
Solution,” Deutsche Bank, Global Markets Foreign Exchange, 2006.
6
Many (about 25%) of the managers in the FXSelect database are also included in other well known
hedge fund databases (CISDM and TASS). As another example for the visibility of the platform,

7

Deutsche Bank provided daily returns data (gross of fees) for all managers who were
actively trading on the platform since its exception. To correct for accounting errors
and eliminate outliers, we transformed the daily returns into weekly returns by using
Wednesday observations.7 Weekly data provide 52 observations for each 12-month
period, which is sufficient to obtain reasonably efficient parameter estimates with a
four factor model.

Backfill and Survivorship biases
Performance evaluation needs to control for the usual biases affecting databases. In
particular, backfill and survivorship biases might be severe. As indicated earlier,
managers were required to submit at least 18 months of performance data before
being considered for the platform. As a manager could choose the time when to
approach Deutsche Bank, waiting for the “best” 18 months of past performance would
have been possible. To correct for backfill bias, we use returns after a manager has
actually joined the platform and started trading. Also, during our sample period, many
managers have joined and exited the platform due to a poor performance. We label
these managers “dead” funds. Figure 3 shows the number of “dead” funds (as of
April 2008), the number of “live” funds and the total number of funds from April
2005 until March 2008. Figure 3 illustrates the magnitude of the survivorship bias.
While 22 funds started in the platform in April 2005, only 15 of these funds (68%)
survived until April 2008. Almost 1/3 of the funds exited the platform within three
years after listing, as we show later most likely due to poor performance. This

Deutsche Bank recently launched the Mercer Currency Manager Index – a multimanager product based
on managers from the FXSelect platform chosen by Mercer Investment Consulting.

highlights the necessity of including the performance of dead funds in the analyses.8
We obtained data for 80 funds in total, but only 15 of these funds had a complete 3year track record.

Data for Risk Factors
Carry Factor
We use the Deutsche Bank G10 Harvest Index as the proxy for the returns of a carry
strategy.9 This index reflects the return of being long the 3 high-yielding currencies
against being short the 3 low-yielding currencies within the G10 currency universe.
The index is rebalanced quarterly. Every quarter the currencies are re-ranked
according to their current 3-month Libor rate. The Bloomberg code for this factor is
DBHVG10U Index.

Trend Factor
As a proxy for the trend-following factor, we use the AFX Currency Management
Index.10 The AFX Index is based on trading in seven currency pairs weighted by their
volume of turnover in the spot market, with returns for each pair based on an equally-

8

Not correcting for backfill and survivorship biases resulted in significant alpha estimates for the
average manager in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006. The average alpha for 2007 was also
estimated to be positive, but was not significantly different from zero. These results contrast strongly
with the reported results after correcting for backfill and survivorship biases, where none of the annual
periods average alphas was found to be significantly different from zero.
9
In this paper, we were not able to use the same proxies for risk factors as in PL (2008) as the Citi
indices were provided to us only on a monthly base. On the other hand, the Deutsche Bank indices are
available as daily data in Bloomberg. To check the validity of using different indices for proxies of the
risk factors, we redid the regressions reported in PL (2008) for the period, which overlaps with this
study, using indices from Deutsche Bank. There was essentially no difference in the empirical results
whether we used Deutsche Bank or Citi factors as right hand side variables.
10
Monthly data for this index are available at the AFX web site
(http://www.ljmu.ac.uk/LBS/93557.htm). We are grateful to Jason Laws from the Liverpool John
Moore University for providing daily data. We transformed the daily returns into weekly returns by
using the Wednesday observations.

weighted portfolio of three moving average rules (32, 61 and 117 days).11 Earlier
research by Lequeux and Acar (1998) showed that this measure was a good proxy for
a trend-following style among professional managers. The AFX Index is a well
established proxy for trend-following strategies. It has been used for a number of
years in various research papers, and therefore is known to researchers in this field.

Value Factor
We use the Deutsche Bank FX PPP Index as the proxy for the returns of a value
strategy. To gauge relative value, Deutsche Bank prepares a ranking based on the
average daily spot rate over the last three months divided by the PPP exchange rate as
published annually by the OECD. The FX PPP index reflects the return of being long
the 3 currencies with the highest rank (undervalued currencies) against being short the
3 currencies with the lowest rank (overvalued currencies) within G10 currency
universe. The Bloomberg code for this factor is DBPPPUSF Index.

Currency Volatility Factor
We use the Deutsche Bank Currency Volatility Index as the proxy for foreign
exchange volatility. This index is calculated as the weighted average of 3-month
implied volatility for nine major currency pairs (as provided by the British Bankers
Association) with weights based on trading volume in the BIS surveys.12 The
Bloomberg code for this factor is CVIX Index.

11

The seven currency pairs are EUR-USD, USD-JPY, USD-CHF, GBP-USD, EUR-JPY, EUR-GBP,
and EUR-CHF.
12
The nine currency pairs are EUR-USD, USD-JPY, USD-CHF, USD-CAD, AUD-USD, GBP-USD,
EUR-JPY, EUR-GBP, and EUR-CHF.

3. Empirical Results on Currency Return Indices
Grouping Managers into Fund of Funds
To measure the overall returns for managers included on DB FXSelect, we construct
several portfolios representing all available funds and certain subsets of funds. The
first “fund-of-funds” (FoF) portfolio is compromised of equally weighted positions in
each of the funds available on the platform on every Wednesday over the sample
period. The return on this index can be defined as:

R FOF ,t =

nt

∑R
j =1

j ,t

/ nt

(2)

where
Rj.t is the weekly return for manager j at time t
nt is the number of managers available on the platform at time t

This portfolio is rebalanced weekly with newly listed funds added and “dead” funds
excluded from our fund-of-funds portfolio. As a result, every one of the 80 managers
who were on the platform between April 2005 and March 2008 is included in our
fund–of-funds index during their active period on the platform. From Figure 3, we see
that nt ranges from a low of 22 funds in April 2005 rising steadily to a high of 65
funds in December 2006 and then levelling off. The FoF portfolio is our primary
gauge of performance of managers on the DB FXSelect platform and represents an
investable index.

11

Figure 4 plots the cumulative performance of the FoF portfolio. The performance is
positive, highlighting the attraction of currency as an alternative asset class.13
However, almost all of the performance is generated in the last 12 months. This
performance pattern is consistent with the performance of the Parker FX index and
the BCTI (see Table 1).14

To gain additional perspective on the performance of funds on the DB FXSelect
platform, we construct two other portfolios, one consisting only of “dead” funds, i.e.
the funds which were no longer on the platform in April 2008, and a second portfolio
of “live” funds, i.e. those that were still active as of April 2008. The returns on these
two funds are defined in an analogous way to our FoF, namely

R D ,t =

R L ,t =

nD ,t

∑R
j =1

nL , t

∑R
j =1

D
j ,t

/ n D ,t

(3)

L
j ,t

/ n L ,t

(4)

where
R Dj , y is the weekly return for manager of dead fund j at time t

R Lj , y is the weekly return for manager of live fund j at time t
13

The annualized Sharpe ratio of the FoF portfolio is 0.56, comparable with the Sharpe ratios of the
S&P 500 index (0.30), MSCI World index (0.71) and the Lehman Global Aggregate bond index (0.75)
during this period. Furthermore, the attraction of currencies as an alpha source is visible trough the low
correlation with the other asset classes. The correlation of the returns on the FoF portfolio with the
returns on the S&P 500, MSCI World and Lehman Global Aggregate indices is -0.4%, 12% and 23%,
respectively. The Sharpe ratio is computed as the average excess annualized monthly return (including
dividends) divided by the annualized standard deviation of the excess returns. We use the 1- month
LIBID (LIBOR less 12.5 bps) as the risk free rate.
14
The correlation over this 3-year period between the monthly returns on the FoF portfolio and the
monthly returns on the Parker FX index and the returns on the BCTI is 67% and 65%, respectively.

12

nD,t is the number of managers classified as dead as of April 2008 but available
on the platform at time t
nL,t is the number of managers classified as living as of April 2008 and
available on the platform at time t

For example, the dead portfolio would have invested in 7 funds as of April 2005,
increasing to 20 at the end of 2006 and consisting of only one manager in March 2008
(see Figure 3). The number of living funds reached 59 in March 2008, Compared to
the investable FoF index, our “Dead” and “Live” portfolios represent an “in-sample”
experiment, which could be conducted only by looking backwards as we did not know
which funds are going to die or remain on the platform. The cumulative performance
of these two portfolios as shown in Figure 5 clearly differs and we will analyze this
more closely in the next section.

Regression Results on Return Indices
Following the approach in PL (2008), we estimate equation (1) using 156 weekly
observations over the 3-year sample period, April 2005 – March 2008. We regress the
returns of these 3 portfolios (FoF, Live and Dead) on the four risk factors described in
the previous section. Alpha is the estimated intercept term, i.e. that portion of excess
returns not explained by the four factor model, or

αˆ = Rt − ∑i βˆi Fi ,t

(5)

Overall, the results in Table 2 support the four-factor model of currency trading
returns. The model explains roughly 53% of the variability of the “FoF” portfolio

Over a longer period, from February 1987 to April 2008, the correlation between the returns on the
Parker FX index and the returns on the BCTI is 90%.
13

returns. Trend appears to be the most significant factor. The trend coefficient is 0.40,
larger than for any other factor and highly significant. On average, the managers on
the FXSelect platform seem to rely on trend-following. The trend factor alone
explains 40% of the variability of the excess returns of the “FoF” portfolio (we have
regressed the returns of “FoF” portfolio on each individual factor, but do not report
the results). The carry coefficient is also positive and significant. The value
coefficient is significant but negative, indicating that on average managers were
positioned to profit from further deviations from PPP. The volatility coefficient is
positive but not significant at the 10% level in a 2-tail test.

Our point estimate for alpha in the “FoF” portfolio is zero and not significant. This
result implies that managers included in the FXSelect platform were not able to
generate alpha on average between April 2005 and March 2008. This confirms the
presumption in the market that this period has been extremely challenging for
currency managers. It is also consistent with previous research (PL 2008) that as a
group, currency managers were not able to generate significant alpha returns over the
long run (between 1990 and 2006). The returns in our sample are gross of fees, which
means that the average alpha would be negative after management fees. Managers
often charge a 2% per annum management fee and 20% performance fee, but fees do
vary.

As the population of funds in the FXSelect platform changed over the 3-year period, it
is interesting to explore differences in the performance of Live versus Dead funds, as
defined by equations (3) and (4). Figure 5 reveals that live funds achieved a
cumulative value of 108.7 far better than dead funds where value sank to only 91.6

14

after 3 years. Put differently, the live funds earned about 2.8% per annum (with an
information ratio of 0.91) compared to dead funds which earned -2.8% per annum
(with an information ratio of -1.21).15 We examine the performance of live and dead
funds more closely with various regression tests. Several observations stand out in
Table 2.

First, the alpha for the “Live” portfolio is quite high at almost 3 bps per week (or
1.4% per year). Although, not significant, this alpha suggests that this group of
managers might have at least roughly covered their management fees. The alpha for
the “Dead” portfolio is negative and significant. The “dead” managers lost about 6.5
bps per week (or roughly 3.3% per year). A t-test for the equality of the alphas of the
“Live” and the “Dead” portfolio rejects the null hypothesis of equal means at the 95%
confidence level (p-value = 0.0107). This may well explain why the “dead” funds
exited the trading platform.

Second, the “live” managers have a positive and significant carry coefficient, but the
“dead” managers have a negative and significant carry coefficient. Both groups are
significantly exposed to trend, although the “live” managers have almost twice as
much trend exposure as the “dead” managers. This is a very interesting result as it
suggests that “betting against carry” was an important reason why the “dead”
managers underperformed. There has been a presumption in the market, that the
recent underperformance of trend-following rules (the AFX is roughly flat in the
period under consideration) has been the main reason for the disappointing
performance of professional currency managers. Our results suggest that this

15

An information ratio is the ratio of excess returns divided by their standard deviation.
15

presumption may be misplaced. Our results show that the strong performance of carry
(up to the beginning of the credit crunch in July 2007) had a substantial impact on
managers who were betting against the carry strategy. Ironically, although some
managers might have been punished due to heavy exposure to carry after July 2007
(e.g. NZD/JPY dropped 23% between July 24, 2007 and August 16, 2007), many
managers seem to have suffered heavy losses prior to that by betting against carry.

Third, the “live” managers have a negative and significant exposure to the value
factor and the “dead” managers have a positive, but not significant value coefficient.
Betting against PPP and for continuation of departures from fair value seems to have
helped the surviving managers to remain on the platform.

Finally, the R-square for the “live” managers (55%) is much higher than the 18% Rsquare for “dead” managers. Anson (2008) theorizes that there is a trade-off between
beta style returns and alpha returns. In short, strategies that mimic an index cannot
earn returns that lead to outperformance. In an earlier study (PL, 2008), we found
evidence supporting Anson’s conjecture, namely that currency managers with high Rsquare tend to have lower alpha, and vice versa. In the DB FXSelect sample which
includes live and dead funds, our results suggest that live managers tended to track the
four factors more closely, earning beta returns, which should have helped them
remain in operation. And indeed the live managers in our sample earned positive
(although not significant) alpha as well. With weaker linkages to the four style
factors, the dead managers were positioned to execute “pure” alpha seeking strategies.
Unfortunately, in this instance, the dead managers realized significant negative alpha.

16

So while being an alpha manager is good in the sense that it would justify active
management fees - it is good only as long as the managers are able to deliver positive
returns. Beta chasers might find it more difficult to justify alpha fees, but sticking
close to the benchmark (the four trading strategies) has apparently helped them to stay
in business. This result is consistent with a common strategy in the asset management
industry. The bulk of assets under management are allocated close to the benchmark
as large deviations from the benchmark expose the manager to significant business
risk in case of underperformance.

To better understand this anomaly of high (low) R-square and high (low) alpha, we
re-estimated the regressions for “live” and “dead” funds in Table 2 including
quadratic terms for each factor to test for market timing.16 The results for “live”
managers show positive and significant timing ability with respect to the trend
following factor (see Table 3). Once this effect is included, the point estimate for
alpha for live managers drops to -2.7 bps per week from +2.7 bps per week.,
suggesting that all of their alpha could be accounted for by timing skills in trend
following.17

The “dead” managers also have positive timing skill in trend, but on the other hand,
they exhibit negative timing skills for volatility.18 The actual returns of “dead”
managers were made worse by taking positions that faltered when volatility increased.

16

Lo (2007) proposes a quadratic term as a way to detect market timing skills.
Having estimated the alpha of the live managers with the 4-factor model and with the market timing
model (8-factors) we were able to test for equality in the alphas. A t-test rejects the null hypothesis of
equal means at the 90% confidence level (p-value = 0.0866). Thus, market timing has significantly
contributed to the superior returns of the live managers.
18
The coefficient of the squared volatility term is significant only at the 10% level. However, in an
alternative specification of the market timing model, which omits the volatility factor, the dead
managers exhibit a significant negative market timing ability in the carry strategy at the 5% level.
17

17

Overall, our analysis suggests that market timing skills had no significant positive
impact on the returns of dead managers.19

4. Empirical Results for Individual Managers

Full three-year sample period
Table 4 summarizes the results for the individual currency managers with a track
record spanning the entire 3-year period. The first row of Table 4 shows the results for
an equally weighted portfolio (“Index” portfolio) consisting of all 15 managers. As in
the case of the “Live” and “Dead” portfolios, this is a backward looking exercise as
we did not know which managers who were on the platform in April 2005 would
remain until March 2008.

For the 15 individual managers, Table 4 shows that trend was the most important
factor over the 3-year period. Trend is significant for more than half of the managers
(8). Carry is significant for 7 managers, but three of the managers had a significant
negative exposure to carry. It seems that while 25% of the managers were exhibiting
carry exposure, a similar number were betting on liquidation of carry trades. Value
was significant only for 5 managers and four of these managers had a negative
exposure to value, i.e. they were betting for further deviation from PPP. Volatility was
significant for 4 managers – two managers would have benefited from falling
volatility environment (the volatility coefficient was negative and significant) and two
managers would have benefited from rising volatility environment (positive and
significant volatility beta). Finally, none of the managers was able to deliver

A t-test for the equality of the alphas estimated with the 4-factor model and with the market timing

significant alpha as defined by our four factor model. Manager L28 was the best of all
with alpha estimated at 12 bps per week (about 6.0% per year) and significant at the
90% confidence level.

Table 5 reports the annualized excess returns, standard deviations and information
ratios for these 15 managers. The average excess annual return is positive, ranging
from -3.30% (L58) to 16.10% (L29) and the volatility ranges from 3.53% (L10) to
19.28% (L29). The average information ratio is 0.37. However, this average
information ratio overstates the performance of the average manager during this
challenging period as it is not adjusted for survivorship bias. The fourth column of
Table 5 ranks the managers by their information ratio. Manager L28 is ranked first
(IR equals 1.17) and manager L58 is ranked last (fifteen) with an information ratio of
-0.35.

We also report the annualized alpha return, the standard deviation of alpha returns
(tracking error) and the alternative information ratio (IR*) as defined in PL (2008). 20
Rank* is therefore the ranking of the managers by their IR*. Note that manager L35
experiences the largest improvement in ranking; he jumps to place 8th from place 12th.
This is not a surprise as his R-square was the second smallest (see Table 3). Less than
6% of the variability of his returns could be explained by the exposure to the four
factors.

20

The information ratio (IR) is defined as the ratio of excess returns to their standard deviation. If we
assume that all returns are excess returns, then IR = Rj /σ(Rj) , where Rj is the annualized average
excess return and σ(Rj) is its annualized standard deviation. Using equation (1) to estimate alpha, PL
define the alternative information ratio as IR* = άj /σ(άj).
19

The average IR* is smaller (0.24) than the average IR (0.37). This suggests that
significant part of the returns of the average manager could be contributed to exposure
to the four risk factors and it is not pure alpha.

Successive one-year samples
To investigate performance and style persistence, we estimate equation (1) using 52
weekly observations on successive one-year periods. Table 6 to 8 show the results for
three periods: April 2005 to March 2006, April 2006 to March 2007 and April 2007 to
March 2008. For each sub-period, we include those managers who have a full
performance track record in the respective period. We start with 22 funds in the first
sub-period. Twenty-one of these managers have also a full performance history in the
second sub-period (manager D10 exited the platform in January 2007 – after a total
return of -12% since entering) and is not included in the second sub-period. An
additional 31 managers joined the platform between May 2005 and April 2006 and
have a full track record available trough the second sub-period. Thus, the total number
of managers with a performance track record between April 2006 and March 2007
rises to 52. The last sub-period contains 46 currency managers. Twenty-one managers
did not make it through the last 12 months after joining the platform sometime before
April 2007. This illustrates again the magnitude of the survivorship bias and the
necessity to include the performance of the “dead” funds in the analyses.

Several results stand out from the analysis. First, the data continue to support the four
factor model over shorter periods, specifically for these three one-year sub-periods.
To gauge the explanatory power of the model on an index level, we have proceeded as
in the section above and constructed three equally-weighed portfolios, which consist

20

of the managers with a full history in the respective sub-period. These
portfolios/indices are in the row labelled “Index.” In the three 12-month periods
ending March 2006, March 2007 and March 2008, the four factors explain 50.0%,
61.3% and 67.3% respectively of the variability of the returns in these portfolios.
Looking at individual managers, the median R-squares are 19.7%, 20.8% and 26.2%
over the three successive periods. On a year-by-year basis, between 10-25% of
individual managers exhibit an R-square exceeding 50% (the highest R-square, 81%,
was recorded for manager L9 in the third sub-period), while roughly the same fraction
produce an R-square under 10%.

Second, the importance of trend seems to be declining while the importance of carry
seems to be rising and exceeded trend in the last sub-period. Table 9 shows the
fraction of the managers with significant exposure to each individual factor for the
different sub-periods. While trend was the most important factor between April 2005
and March 2006 with 50% of the managers significantly exposed to it, trend was only
second to last in terms of importance between March 2007 and April 2008 with only
28% of the managers significantly exposed to it. Ironically, this was also the period
where trend started to perform well again as a strategy. Trend yielded 0.1% in the first
sub-period, 1.11% in the second sub-period and 6.12% in the last sub-period. Carry
shows a similar picture: it yielded its worst performance (-3.4%) in the third subperiod, where 50% of the managers were significantly exposed to it (18 with positive
coefficient and 5 with a negative coefficient). This suggests a reason to avoid not only
“crowded” trades, but also “crowded” styles as well. When a trading style becomes
“crowded” it appears as if performance in that style declines.21

21

The relationship between crowding and performance is a topic we leave for future research.
21

Third, only a small fraction of managers (10-17%) were significantly exposed to
value and volatility with the exception of the last sub-period in which value was the
second most important factor (after carry) with 37% of the managers exhibiting
significant value beta. However, while half of these managers were betting for meanreversion towards the PPP exchange rate, the other half was betting for further
deviation from PPP.

Performance persistence
To investigate the question of whether managers who have been performed well in the
past continue to perform well in the future, we follow Aggarwal and Jorion (2008)
and report the results for the following regression

α jt = δ 0 + δ 1α jt −1 + µ jt

(6)

Where αj is the excess return for fund manager j that is not explained by the
four factors, or

αˆ j = R j ,t − ∑i βˆi , j Fi ,t

(7)

Table 10 presents the results. We have 21 funds in the second sub-period, which were
also active in the first sub-period and 37 in the third sub-period, which were also
active in the second sub-period. Neither regression yields a significant coefficient on
the previous year’s alpha. This result suggests that past excess performance as
measured by alpha is not related to future performance. Although, δ1 is positive, it is
not significantly different from zero.

22

As an alternative way to gauge performance persistence, we form portfolios based on
performance quartiles. The performance of the best performing (ranked by alpha
return, performance in the first quartile Q1) managers in the first sub-period is
aggregated by constructing an equally weighted portfolio, labelled the Q1 portfolio.
We also aggregate the performance of the bottom quartile managers into a Q4
portfolio. Comparing the performance of the Q1 and the Q4 portfolio in the second
sub-period is a way to gauge persistence.22 The average weekly alpha for the Q1
portfolio in the second sub-sample was 1.4 bps (or 0.7% annualized), higher than the
average weekly alpha of the Q4 portfolio -11 bps (or -5.8% annualized). This is an
indication for some persistence. However, a t-test for the difference in the means does
not reject the hypothesis of equal average alpha.

We performed the same exercise for the third sub-period (comparing the performance
of managers who were in the top quartile in the second sub-period with the
performance of the managers who were in the bottom quartile in the second subperiod). Again, there is no evidence of performance persistence. The average alpha
for the Q4 portfolio was even higher (3.6 bps or 1.88% annualized) than the average
alpha of the Q1 portfolio (2.8 bps or 1.46% annualized). Thus, the managers who
were in the bottom quartile (ranked on alpha) between April 2006 and March 2007
outperformed during the following 12 months those managers who were in the top
quartile between April 2006 and March 2007. Again, a t-test for the difference in the
means did not reject the hypothesis of equal average alpha.

22

Managers who did not survive during the following 12 months are included as long as they are on the
platform. Although Carpenter and Lynch (1999) recommend comparing top and bottom decile
portfolios, because of our small sample size, we follow Aggarwal and Jorion (2008) and compare top
and bottom quartile portfolios
23

Note, that the methodology in equation (6) estimates the average persistence (from
year t to year t+1) for a cross section of managers rather than the persistence over
time for a specific manager.23 Thus, our rejection of persistence does not mean that
not a single manager is able to deliver persistent performance. Indeed, in a previous
study Levich and Pojarliev (2008) report that of the 8 managers with significant alpha
over a 3-year period (2001-03), fully 7 managers continued to make positive alpha in
the following 3-year period (2004-06).24 No manager showed significant alpha in the
second period who did not produce alpha in the first sub-period. Although, the
average manager does not show persistence, some skilled managers do.

Style persistence
To check for style persistence, we perform regressions similar to (6) estimating cross
sectional regressions for each one of the four betas. Table 11 reports the results.

The results indicate strong persistence for the trend factor and carry factor. The
coefficients for both carry and trend for year t-1 are positive and highly significant.
This suggests that managers who are exposed to carry in period t-1 are likely to
maintain significant carry exposure in period t. The same result is valid for the trend
factor. Value is persistent only from the second into the third sub-period, but not from
the first into the second sub-period. We do not detect persistence for volatility, which
is also consistent with the finding that this is the least important factor.

23

The later would require many estimates of alpha for manager j over successive periods to estimate
that manager’s δ1 persistence factor.
24
We should caution that in this paper our tests for performance persistence rely on performance
measured over only one year. The one-year period may be too short to accurately access underlying
performance. The differences between performance persistence when estimating performance over
different periods (1-year, 3-years and 5-years) is a topic we leave for a future research. In addition, we
24

Style persistence can be interpreted as either good or bad news. It is good news, since
an investor might expect that his currency manager will continue to follow the same
investment style. This would allow endowment and pension fund sponsors to issue
mandates that diversify their style exposure. On the other hand, it is bad news, since
style persistence would indicate less market timing ability, i.e. switching between
styles when one style fails to perform well.

5. Conclusions

In this paper, we estimate cross sectional annual alphas for professional currency
managers for the three years between April 2005 and March 2008. With data for all
managers on the DB FXSelect platform since inception, even those who eventually
exit, we can control for survivorship and backfill bias.

The results confirm results from our earlier study, namely that four factors
representing the returns of well–known currency trading strategies and currency
volatility explain a significant part of returns of professional currency managers. We
extend those results by demonstrating that the relationship is present in a different
time period (2005-08 versus 2001-06 in the earlier study) and for shorter intervals of 3
years and 1 year. More importantly, obtaining annual alphas and style betas allows us
to test for performance and style persistence. We find no indication of performance
persistence, but we do find statistically significant evidence of style persistence.

These results have important implications for the investment management industry.
Plan sponsors should be careful when selecting currency managers based only on past
examine only two intervals, which may be too few to detect persistence especially if persistence is
weak.
25

performance data. As in other venues of investment management, in this sample of
currency managers it appears that past performance is no indication for future
performance. On the other hand, style persistence indicates that choosing currency
managers with different styles makes sense as they are likely to maintain their style,
and thus continue to offer a diversification benefit. Plan sponsors usually seek to hire
more than one currency manager with different styles to obtain diversification
benefits. From this perspective, our evidence for style persistence is welcome.
However, style persistence may imply that individual managers are less able to
exploit market timing ability.

In addition, we document some significant differences between managers who did not
survive our three-year sample and managers who were still alive and active in April
2008. Not surprisingly, we find that surviving managers produced alpha that was
higher than exiting managers, and with a difference of about 9.5 bps per week (or
nearly 5% per year), the difference is both statistically and economically significant.
Our analysis suggests that living mangers generally tracked our four factors more
closely (with a higher R-square) than managers that would eventually die. Sticking
closer to the “benchmarks” has helped some managers to stay in business.
Components of their investment strategies, as evidenced by the sign of factor
coefficients, varied as well. Contrary to the presumption in the market that the recent
underperformance of trend-following strategies was the main reason for the lacklustre
performance of currency managers over the last three years, we found that “betting for
liquidation of carry strategies” caused more damage for some managers. Additional
tests suggest that live managers owe some of their success to timing skills in the trend

26

following strategy, whereas dead managers demonstrated negative timing with respect
to volatility.

Overall, our results lend further support to the notion that style factors explain a
substantial part of returns for indices composed of professional currency fund
managers. While the track records of individual managers – their strategies and
performance, as well as their longevity – vary considerably, managers appear to have
two things in common – a lack of performance persistence and a tendency for style
persistence.

Our results are subject to the limitation that we analyzed only the currency managers
listed on the DB FXSelect platform. Furthermore, since the platform was launched in
March 2005, the available data cover a relative short period of 3 years (2005-08).
Further research may help to understand what factors influence the performance of
individual managers.

The Carry Index return is represented by the Deutsche Bank G10 Harvest Index as the proxy for the
returns of a carry strategy. This index reflects the return of being long the 3 high-yielding currencies
against being short the 3 low-yielding currencies within G10 currency universe. The index is
rebalanced quarterly.
The Trend Index return is represented by the AFX Currency Management Index. The AFX Index is
based on trading in seven currency pairs (EUR-USD, USD-JPY, USD-CHF, GBP-USD, EUR-JPY,
EUR-GBP, and EUR-CHF) weighted by their volume of turnover in the spot market, with returns for
each pair based on an equally-weighted portfolio of three moving average rules (32, 61 and 117 days).
The Value Index return is represented by the Deutsche Bank FX PPP Index. The average daily spot rate
over the last three months is divided by the PPP exchange rate as published annually by the OECD and
ranked. This index reflects the return of being long the 3 currencies with the highest rank (undervalued
currencies) against being short the 3 currencies with the lowest rank (overvalued currencies) within
G10 currency universe.
