Adjusting the Gross Changes Data:
Implications for Labor Market Dynamics
ABSTRACT

This paper develops a procedure for adjusting the Current Population Survey

gross changes data for the effects of reporting errors. The corrected data
suggest that the labor nBrket is much less dynamic than has frequently been

suggested. Conventional measures sy understate the duration of unemployment by
as much as eighty percent and overstate the extent of novement into and out of
the lp.bor force by several hundred percent. The adjusted data also throw
demographic differences in patterns of labor nExket dynamics into sharp relief.

The dynamics of the American labor market have been an important focus of

research over the last decade. Early work by Hall (12], Feldstein [8] and
Marston 1161 suggested that nost unemployment was due to normal turnover, not

to individuals with special employment problems. A typical conclusion was
that of Feldstein who wrote that "almost everyone who is out of work can find

his usual job in a relatively short time." This dynamic view of unemployment
has been challenged in the ire recent work of Clark and Summers [6] and
Akerlof and Main 12].
can

Clark

and Summers in particular focus on how analysts

be misled by spurious labor market transitions, writing that "it seems

likely that some of the observed flows (into and out of the labor force)
arise from inconsistent reporting of consistent behavior [7, p. 281." This
paper re—examines the empirical basis of these debates.
Studies of labor market dynamics are of necessity based on survey

data. In some cases inferences are drawn from individual responses to

retrospective questions. In other cases, presumably nre accurate inferences
are drawn from panel data in which individuals are interviewed several times.

The BLS Gross Changes data, which have been tabulated since l948, are a major

source of such information about individuals' labor market experience. While
the data have not been published in recent years due to concerns about accuracy,
they have been used in numerous studies of labor market dynaniics.l

The report of the National Commission on Employment and Unemployment

Statistics [171 recommended that despite the data difficulties, the BLS
should resume publication of the gross flows data on an occasional basis.

The Commission concluded that "the importance of Current Population Survey—
based gross changes data for enhancing understanding of changes in the labor
market requires that very high priority be given to improvement in the data.

—2—

It is possible, of course, that a solution will not be achieved, but the
potential value of the data warrants an intensive effort [17, p. 2171."

In

using longitudinal data, the flows of individuals between different labor

market states are derived by comparing the responses of individuals on two dif-

ferent survey dates. On each survey, some individuals are incorrectly
classified with respect to labor market status. While these errors may largely
cancel in tabulations of the unemployment rate or other labor market aggregates,

estimated flow rates between labor market states are extremely sensitive to

them. Individuals who are misclassified in one month but not in the next will
be reported as moving from one state to another even though their behavior has

not changed. Some observed transitions will therefore be spurious, leading to
overestimates of the amount of turnover and mobility in the labor market. Such
errors can substantially bias estimates of the expected duration of both

unemployment and nonparticipation spells. They are also likely to bias inferences about subtler aspects of labor market dynamics, such as efforts to estimate
"state dependence" effects.

This paper presents a technique for correcting the classification
errors which plague the Current Population Survey (cPs) gross flows data.
Similar techniques could readily be applied to other data sets.

We use the

CPS Reinterview Survey to estimate the incidence of errors in the gross
changes data, and then calculate revised flows by adjusting for spurious

transitions. The results of our procedure suggest that conventional measures
greatly overstate flows into and out of the labor force. As a consequence,
standard estimates of unemployment durations, whether based directly on gross

flows data or on other information such as the average duration of completed
or incomplete spells, are biased downwards.

The labor force attachment of

underestimated.

This paper is divided into four sections. The first explains our procedure for estimating the incidence of response errors which affect the CPS and

therefore the gross changes data. Section Two presents our algorithm for
adjusting the gross changes data, and contrasts our revised labor market

flows with the unadjusted data. The third section uses the adjusted flows to
analyze several characteristics of the American labor market, focussing on

differences in the experience of different demographic groups. There is a
brief concluding section which suggests several directions for future work.

Q =

where, for example,

is the probability that an individual who is employed

will be measured as not—in—the—labor force. There are only six independent
probabilities in this matrix, since the elements of each row sum to unity.
The principal source of data on the incidence of errors in the Current
Population Survey is the Reinterview Survey conducted by the Bureau of the

Census.2 This survey measures coding error and evaluates interviewer performance by reinterviewing a subsample of CPS households. In the initial interview, respondents are asked about their activities in the previous week.
Reinterviews occur one week after the initial interview, and involve 5.6 percent

of the respondents in the original survey. During the reinterview, respondents
are asked to describe their activities two weeks prior to the reinterview, in
the week referred to in the initial interview.

Individuals in the reinterview survey are divided into a Reconciled and an

—5—

Unreconciled Subsample. For the 80 percent of the reinterviews in the
Reconciled Subsample, the reinterviewer conducts a second interview and then

compares the results with those on the first survey. He then attempts to determine which, if either, of any conflicting responses is correct. The results of
this reconciliation are recorded on a third form and tabulated along with the

survey responses. For the twenty percent of the Reinterview Survey respondents
in the Unreconciled Subsample, there is no attempt to investigate differences
between responses on the first and second surveys.

The reinterviewer conducts

a second interview without reference to responses on the first interview.
The Bureau of the Census publishes tabulations of Reinterview Survey results

for some highly aggregated demographic groups. To investigate differences in
labor market experience for different demographic groups, we made our own
tabulations of error rates from Reinterview Survey data tapes provided by the

Bureau of the Census. Our data set contains 25,311 reinterviews conducted
between January and June, 1981.
Table I shows the distribution of recorded labor market status for individuals in the Reconciled and Unreconciled Subsamples of the Reinterview Survey

for the period January—June, 1981. The table shows the percentage of individuals in each Reinterview subsample by their classified labor market status

on each survey. 0ff—diagonal elements correspond to different responses on

the two surveys. The table suggests a significant amount of response error
in the CPS. More than five percent of individuals in the Unreconciled
Subsample were classified differently on the two surveys.
There are several ways to use the reinterview survey data to estimate

the incidence of survey response errors.3 All are plagued by the fact that the
true labor market status of survey participants is never revealed.

Data on

some individual's reconciled data entries nay even be subject to errors,

especially since consistent but incorrect responses on the initial interview and
the reinterview will not prompt any investigation by- the reinterviewer.

A simple procedure for estimating error rates would involve comparing
individuals' responses on the first survey with their recorded response after

reconciliation. Estimates of the response error rates based only on the
Reconciled Subsample of the Reinterview Survey are commonly regarded as

downward—biased, however)4 This is in part because some reinterviewers, who
are provided with a copy of the household's original survey responses, may
use the original survey answers as a guide in completing the reinterview survey. This minimizes the need for reconciliation and yields an overly--

reliable picture of the Current Population Survey. The rate of
inconsistencies between the first and second interviews is substantially
higher in the Unreconciled Subsample than in the Reconciled Subsample.

A more accurate estimate of the response error rates, and therefore of the
adjusted gross changes, can be obtained using data from both the Reconciled and

the Unreconciled Subsamples. Our procedure may be described in two parts.
First, for individuals in the Reconciled Subsample, we estimated the probability
of truly belonging to each labor market state conditional upon reported first
and second interview status

There are twenty—seven such probabilities, but since they must satisfy adding up

for each i—j combination, only eighteen parameters are independent.

We assume that the Reconciled Subsample contains a partial sample of the
cases for which Initial Interview and Reinterview responses were different.
Reinterviewers in some cases consult the household's responses on the initial

survey before conducting the reinterview. Some inconsistent responses are
thereby avoided, explaining the lower rate of inconsistent response for the

Reconciled as opposed to the Unreconciled Subsample. Although the Reconciled
Subsample provides a misleading estimate of the incidence of response errors, it
may nonetheless provide reliable estimates of the fraction of inconsistent
cases which should be allocated to each of the two recorded responses.

We used the estimates {wjjk} to impute the probability distribution of true
labor market status for each individual in the Unreconciled Subsample, conditional upon his

responses

as recorded in the initial interview and

the

Reinterview. The number of individuals in the Unreconciled Subsample with

The resulting estimates of classification error probabilities are shown in
Table II. The table displays separate error rates for men, women, the entire
population, as well as seven other demographic groups. Only the off—diagonal
elements of the Q matrix are shown, since the other terms can be computed from
them.

The highest error rates are found for individuals whose reconciled sta-

tus is unemployed. In the whole survey, over eleven percent of the unemployed
are incorrectly classified as not in the labor force. The fraction of
unemployed persons misclassified in this way varies across demographic groups,
from less than seven percent for middle—aged men (aged 25—59) to over seventeen

percent for young women (aged 16—19). For teenagers of both sexes, the error
rate is nearly fourteen percent; at all ages, the error rate Is substantially
higher for women than for men.

The second most important type of misclassification is from unemployment

into employment. Almost four percent of the unemployed individuals in the
population are incorrectly classified as holding a job; this error rate rises

to over six percent for male teenagers. Errors In which employed individuals
are classified as not—in—the—labor force are also surprisingly frequent:
nearly two percent of the employed, and three and a half percent of teenagers,

are miscategorized in this way. Most other error rates are small for the
total population, although for some demographic groups they may become signi-

ficant. For example, among men aged 25—59 who are out of the labor force,
there is a substantial probability (3.8 percent) that they will be

misclassified as employed. The demographic variation in error rates highlights the importance of disaggregating the flows before making adJustments
for classification errors.

Before turning to the next section where we describe how

these

error

probabilities are used to adjust the gross changes data, it is important to

mention several potential biases in xir estimated {q}. Reinterviewers are
instructed to try to interview the same person who was interviewed in the ori-

ginal survey. No similar practice is followed in successive months of the
regular

CPS survey, probably

reported here.

leading

to higher response error rates than those

In addition, if the reconciliation procedure fails to identify

an individual's true labor market status, our estimates of response error will

be too small. There are also biases which work in the opposite direction.
The Reinterview Survey may exaggerate the extent of error since a week is

allowed to pass between the events being described and the survey week. The
Reinterview Survey is frequently conducted by phone which may tend to
exaggerate response errors. Finally, although different CI'S interviewers contact different numbers of households, the Reinterview Survey typically con-

tacts a fixed number of households for each interviewer. If there is any
relationship between the efficiency of interviewers (measured by the number of
interviews they conduct) and their accuracy, then there will be additional
biases

in our estimates of response error.

2. Adjusting the Gross Changes Data
In this section we describe our
{

procedure

for using the estimated

to adjust the reported gross changes. Let F1 denote the measured flow

from labor market state i to state j, while Fij is the true flow. The notation
will refer to our estimates of the true flows. We can use the {q} to
relate the "true" and nasured flows. For example, consider the measured flow
from employment to unemployment. There are nine different combinations of

actual labor market statuses and response errors which can lead an individual
classified as making an E +

Notice that regardless of his true labor market status, every
individual has some chance of being recorded as making an E + U transition.

Of course, for sorr individuals this probability is trivial. The number of
individuals who in fact made U ÷ E transitions but were twice misclassified,

An illustration of our adjustment procedure using total labor market flows is

shown in Table III. The table's first panel reports the annual average unadjusted

flows for the period January 19T7 to December 1982 Transition probabilities
are shown beneath each flow0 The table's next panel, labelled "Adjusted Flows,
without Raking," reports the corrected gross flows calculated using the adjust
ment procedure described above0 Some flows, particularly those involving trari

sitions into and out of the labor force, change dramaticaily There is a c1er
reduction in the number of individuals who are off the diagonal of the flow

matrix. WhIle l26O2 million transitions are recorded in the actual gross flows
data, our adjusted matrix shows only 52O3 million transitions. This implies a
reduction in the escape probabilities from each labor market state and a

corresponding lengthening of the expected residence time in each state0 A more
complete discussion of the implications of these results for labor market dynamics is provided in the next section0

Feinberg,

Stephan IT], for achieving comparability between cell proportions in a contingency table generated from one data source, and marginal totals generated

from another source. We mdif led our adjusted flows using this technique to
conform

with the annual average labor market stocks reported by

the Bureau of

Labor Statistics .5

The results of raking our adjusted flows are reported in the third panel of

Table III. The raking adjustments lead to substantial changes in some of the

flows. For example, the estimated E + B flow declines by over one and one half
million persons, while the N ÷ N flow rises by one million. The implications of

at all. This suggests that relative to the correction for response errors,
margin—consistency adjustments are of limited importance.
One iniportant caveat about our procedure should be noted. We have presented
no evidence to support our assumption that all individuals have identical,

serially uncorrelated probabilities of response error. If this were not the
case, our procedure would overstate the required adjustment to the gross flows

and could lead to negative adjusted flows. Our assumption is not testable
without longitudinal reinterview data.

gross changes data for the total population, teenagers, Men, Women, Men 16—19,

Unadjusted, adjusted but unraked, as well as adjusted and raked flows with
their associated transition probabilities are reported in the Appendix.

The comparison of adjusted and unadjusted flows is of some interest in
itself. In addition, however, labor market dy-narnics can be analyzed by

reference to several other statistics which can be derived from the transition

probability matrices. These include the expected duration of a completed spell
in each labor force state, the probability of an unemployment spell ending in
employment, and the probability of labor force withdrawal within a given nonth.
Expected durations of completed spells in each state are calculated as the
reciprocal

of the exit probability from that state. As discussed in re detail

below, the expected duration of a completed spell of unemployment differs from

the mean duration of interrupted spells published each nnth by the Bureau of

Labor Statistics. Our calculation

depends only on a simple identity linking

flows and stocks, and not on any assumption about the Markovian character

actual

of

labor market behavior. The probability of an unemployment spell en ding

in employment entry is calculated as the ratio UE'UE +

P),

probability of labor force withdrawal is calculated as (PflU +

Marston Ei61

has

-presented 'a very complete analysis of the transition

matrix differences between demographic

groups. Two central conclusions of his

analysis were the importance of transitions into and
the

out

of the labor force, and

great extent of turnover in the labor market. Here we focus on the extent

to which

these conclusions are modified when we make use of our adjusted data.

We then examine the implications of our findings for analyses such as those of

Kaitz

[liii

and Lancaster [l5 which explore labor market dynamics without

making explicit reference to gross changes data.

Table IV presents estimates of the monthly probability of labor market

withdrawal, for different demographic groups, estimated from our unadjusted
and adjusted data. A striking feature of the unadjusted data is the
apparently overwhelming importance of labor force withdrawal. The unadjusted
data imply that over forty percent of the whole labor force can be expected to

leave the labor force within a year. For women, the comparable statistic

As already emphasized, the Reinterview Survey
spurious

reporting of 1abor

infornation

suggests that

force withdrawal is the nost common form of

reporting error. Hence, it is not surprising that the adjusted data present a
very different view of the importance of labor force withdrawal. The overall
withdrawal rate is only about one—third as great for the entire population,

is suggested by the unadjusted data. In

unadjusted data,
job leaving to unemployment is twice as common as job leaving followed by
as

labor
the

force withdrawal. The

contrast to the

adjusted data also imply that about two—thirds of

unemployed end their spell of unemployment by finding

a job.

The differences between the unadjusted and adjusted probabilities vary across
demographic groups. The largest proportionate changes in withdrawal probabili-

ties are

for those groups with the lowest initial withdrawal rates. For mature

men, for example, there is a ninety percent reduction in withdrawal probabilities. Male teenagers, who exhibit high nobility, experience only a thirty
percent reduction as a result of flow adjustment. The probability of a successful escape from unemployment rises for nearly all demographic groups.

These

changes are

nost

pronounced for men aged 25—59.

A second striking feature of the unadjusted data is the apparently
very

high rate of turnover in the labor force. This is illustrated in Table VI,

which provides estimates of unemployment durations using adjusted and unadjusted

flows data. For the entire population the unadjusted data suggest that the mean
duration of unemployment is only about 2.2 months. For.women the estimated
durations are shorter, and for teenagers, they are far shorter, 1.8 months. The

adjusted

data tell a rather different story. For the entire population the

estimated duration of a completed unemployment spell is 3.614 months, almost two—

thirds greater. For women, the expected spell duration rises from 2.0 to 3.1
months, while for man the change is even more pronounced, 2.14 to 14.5 months.

Our adjustments accentuate the differences between teenagers and the remainder
of the population, because they revise upwards the teenagers' durations of
unemployment by only small amounts.
It

is interesting to note that our adjustments bave their most drama-

tic effects on groups whose labor market behavior is least dynamic. If error
rates are relatively constant across demographic groups, then eliminating errors
will have the greatest proportional effect on groups whose members make the

fewest transitions. The point is exemplified by considering the men 25—59

group.

Here the estimated duration of unemployment more than doubles from 2.16

months to 14.T0 months. Unfortunately, these results niist be discounted because

some of the adjusted flow probabilities are negative. This is probably a consequence

of positive serial correlation in reporting errors and suggests that

all our estimates may somewhat overstate the appropriate adjustments. It also
suggests the importance of demographic disaggregation in adjusting these data.

follows naturally that even estimates such as those of

are

likely to underestimate the true extent of con—

cent ration in unemployment.

There is some support for our suggestion that unemployment spells are
longer than usually shown in gross changes data. Non—CPS sources of labor

market information, which are usually retrospective surveys of individual

experience, often find spell lengths for all
longer

labor

market states which are

than those reported by the CPS.6 While interpretation of these facts is

complicated by the varying definitions of unemployment used on non—CPS surveys,
they corroborate our findings.

On balance, our results suggest that the unadjusted gross changes data

lead to very misleading inferences about the character of the labor market. We
suspect

that similar problems plague efforts to use the gross changes data

to

study cyclical phenomena. In particular, conventional analyses may understate
the cyclicality of labor market flows because a relatively constant number of
spurious flows are added in all periods to the cyclically variable true flows.

We believe that our results also cast doubt on conventional analyses

of unemployment which do not make explicit use of the gross changes data. One
common

and

method for analyzing unemployment durations, pioneered by Kaitz

(])41

Salant 120] , involves inferring the distribution of completed spell

lengths

from published information

on the

distribution of interrupted spell

lengths. A simple procedure of this type is to estimate the maan duration of
completed spell lengths by dividing the number of unemployed persons by an estimate of the flow rate into unemployment, based for example on the number of per-

Sons unemployed less than 5 weeks. For 1981 this procedure yields a mean

Still further difficulties infect procedures which rely upon individuals'
reported unemployment 'durations, since these data are often extremely unre-

liable. One way to illustrate this is by comparing the reported unemployment
durations of Current Population Survey respondents who are unemployed in two
consecutive

nnths. The surveys occur roughly four weeks apart, so for

the duration reported in

of

the individuals surveyed provided consistent responses in the two months,

and more than twenty percent reported shorter durations, or the same duration,

on the second survey. Moreover, there is a substantial incidence of large
changes, more than four months, in the reported durations in the two surveys.
These findings suggest that any attempt to apply techniques which are not
robust against measurement errors to analyze duration—related phenomena such
as job—finding are prone to yield substantially misleading results.
A full analysis of how response errors affect the measured duration of
unemployment spells would require a statistical model of how spuriously
misclassified individuals report durations, both during and after their response

error. We have previously 1181 presented some fragments of evidence on this
question. We showed that of those who are classified as unemployed, NILF, and
unemployed in three successive months, less than one third report an
unemployment duration which increases by more than two months between the two

periods of unemployment. On the other hand, less than a quarter consider themselves as beginning a new spell and report durations of less than one month
during

the second spell of

ficulties with
reported

unemployment. These results suggest the dif-

any simple assumption about how classification errors affect

durations.

This research could usefully be extended in several directions.

A

number of methodological issues should be explored. Alternative procedures for
estimating CPS error rates could be devised to relax the assumption that the
reconciliation process correctly- estimates individuals' true labor force status.

Error probabilities could also be estimated imposing the constraint that the

marginal labor market stocks estimated in the CPS are unbiased estimates of the

true stocks. Allowance could be made for heterogeneity within demographic
groups in the likelihood of reporting errors. Alternative procedures to adjust
the actual gross changes data could also be developed.
It would also be valuable to adjust data for several years, to allow study of

cyclical aspects of labor market dynamics. Explorations of the importance of
reporting errors for studies of inter—industry or occupational flows would also

be valuable. It would be particuarly useful to examine the incidence of
reporting errors as a function of an individual's duration in a state so as to
evaluate the reliability of conclusions reached by applying hazard function

—31—

methodologies

to labor market data. Another important area for further research

is the effect of reporting errors in retrospective surveys such as the National
Longitudinal Survey.

Our findings suggest that measurement errors importantly distort estimates of

even basic statistics characterizing the labor market. Statistical techniques
for analyzing labor market data which take account of pervasive measurement

errors

need to be developed. Because of the discrete nature of the data, and

its longitudinal character, standard techniques for the treatment of errors in

variables are not applicable. In work now underway [191, we are developing a
multinomial logit procedure for analyzing labor market transitions which are
reported with error.
