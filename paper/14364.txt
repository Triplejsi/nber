Roy Model Sorting and Non-Random Selection in the Valuation of a Statistical Life

JEL No. J17,J31,Q5,Q51
ABSTRACT
Wage-hedonics is used to recover the value of a statistical life by exploiting the fact that workers choosing
riskier occupations will be compensated with a higher wage. However, Roy (1951) suggests that observed
wage distributions will be distorted if individuals select into jobs according to idiosyncratic returns.
We illustrate how this type of sorting may bias wage-hedonic VSL estimates and describe two estimators
that correct for it. Using data from the CPS, we recover VSL estimates that are three to four times
larger than those based on the traditional techniques, statistically significant, and robust to a wide array
of specifications.

1. INTRODUCTION
Cost-benefit analyses of environmental, workplace, and product safety regulations
frequently require estimates of the monetary value of fatality risk reductions. This value
typically comes in the form of the value of a statistical life (or, alternatively, the value of
a statistical death averted) and is often estimated with wage-hedonic methods.1 Workers
are compensated for choosing to work in risky jobs. However, workers vary in their
idiosyncratic skills and the return to these skills may vary greatly across occupations. In
this paper we show that worker sorting based on idiosyncratic returns can bias value of
statistical life (VSL) estimates derived with the wage-hedonic technique, and we
demonstrate two new empirical strategies to correct for this source of bias. In particular,
we employ techniques introduced by Bayer, Khan, and Timmins (2007) to control for
polychotomous selection when individuals care about more than just pecuniary returns.
These techniques extend the idea originally posited in the Roy model (1951), which
explains occupational sorting as a function of only wages. The extension is appropriate
for wage-hedonics since, in those models, workers sort across occupations based on nonpecuniary job attributes like fatality risk in addition to their wages.2
Correcting for this bias is both empirically important and has significant policy
implications. For example, we estimate the VSL for men aged 18-60 to be roughly three
1

The value of a statistical life (VSL) is constructed from individuals’ revealed or stated willingness to
trade-off other consumption for a marginal reduction in fatality risk (e.g., risk of on-the-job fatality in the
context of wage-hedonics). Suppose, for example, that an individual is willing to pay $40 for a policy that
results in a 1-in-100,000 reduction in the chance of dying. If we were to take 100,000 individuals
confronted with this choice, the policy would lead to one fewer death among them. Although none of those
individuals know which of them will be saved by the policy, their aggregate willingness to pay is 40 x
$100,000 = $4 million. This number is taken as the VSL. If asked for a willingness to pay to avoid his or
her own particular death, any one individual would not be able to give a credible answer to the willingnessto-pay question.

The estimation strategies described below also have applications in other empirical contexts – for
example, individuals migrating across cities, where utility is determined by both the wages and local
amenities.

to four times larger (and statistically significant) when we correct for “Roy sorting” than
the VSL estimated on the same data but with traditional techniques. We find this bias,
moreover, in age-specific VSLs that exhibit patterns similar to those found by previous
researchers.

Our estimates of VSLs for women are reasonable in magnitude and

statistically significant, unlike their counterparts based on traditional wage-hedonic
techniques.

These larger estimates of the VSL (which are also less sensitive to

specification) suggest a greater willingness among Americans to pay for reductions in
fatality risk through environmental, workplace, and product safety regulations than
previously believed.
This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the Roy model and explains
why we should expect sorting based on idiosyncratic returns to yield biased estimates of
the VSL calculated with traditional wage-hedonic techniques. Section 3 discusses how
our estimators deal with (or fail to address) some other well-known problems with the
wage-hedonic approach. Section 4 describes the data we use to implement our estimators,
including information about individual workers from the CPS, data describing
occupational fatalities from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and data on other occupational
attributes from the Department of Labor’s Dictionary of Occupational Titles. Section 5
outlines our first estimation strategy, which semi-parametrically identifies workers’ risk
preferences in the presence of Roy sorting. Section 6 reports the results of our first
estimator alongside results derived from a traditional wage-hedonic procedure, and
discusses the results of a number of alternative model specifications. Section 7 describes
and implements our second estimation strategy, which makes use of stronger

2

independence and distributional assumptions but requires less of the data. Section 8
discusses policy implications and concludes.

2. ROY SORTING BIAS IN THE WAGE-HEDONIC ESTIMATE OF THE VSL
Rosen (1986) refers to the theory of equalizing differences as the “fundamental
(long-run) market equilibrium construct in labor economics.”

It explains how the

difference in wages between risky and safe jobs is determined – if some jobs are less safe
than others, the market equalizing difference (or “compensating differential”) is set so
that enough workers sort into the risky occupation to clear the market. This was the idea
behind Thaler and Rosen’s (1975) seminal research on using labor market outcomes to
value life – i.e., wage-hedonics.
A second literature in labor economics has examined the implications of
idiosyncratic differences in the returns to workers’ abilities for their choice of occupation.
These implications were first demonstrated by Roy (1951), whose name has since been
associated with this class of sorting models. The idea behind the Roy model can be
illustrated in a simple example. In an economy with just two occupations, workers who
choose occupation #1 over occupation #2 receive greater pecuniary returns from this
choice than those workers who choose occupation #2 would have received had they
chosen occupation #1, ceteris paribus. The difference between the wages received by
workers in occupation #1 and occupation #2 will not, therefore, reflect the difference
between the wages that the average worker would have received in each sector. In the
simplest possible case, this type of sorting does not create a problem for measuring
compensating wage differentials. However, with only minor complications, it can have

3

important implications for the ability of wage-hedonics to recover the value of any job
attributes (including fatality risk).

We demonstrate why with a series of numerical

examples.3
Suppose that the wage individual i would receive from working in each of two
occupations is determined by the following wage equation:

(1)

wi , j = βR j + ε i , j

j = 1, 2

where the idiosyncratic component of the wage is drawn from a bivariate normal
distribution.

 ε i ,1 


 ε  ~ i.i.d . N   0 ,  0 1  

 i,2 
  

Let Rj measure the fatality risk in occupation j. Occupation #1 is assumed to be “safe”
(R1 = 0), whereas occupation #2 is “risky” (R2 = 1). For the sake of simplicity, we set the
coefficient on risk in the wage equation (β) to be 1. Figure 1 illustrates the unconditional
distribution of wages in each occupation. The compensating wage differential ($1) is
apparent in the difference between the means of these two distributions.
The distributions portrayed in Figure 1 are not, however, the distributions of
wages once workers choose their preferred occupation (the conditional wage distribution).
Individuals sort across occupations to maximize utility, which is determined in this simple

For a formal description of these features of the Roy model, see Heckman and Honoré (1990).

example by wages in combination with fatality risk. Individual i receives the following
utility from choosing to work in occupation j:

(3)

U i , j = wi , j − βR j

In the case described in equations (1) and (2), the average wage in occupation #2 will still
be higher than that in occupation #1 by $1 to compensate for its added risk, even after
individuals have optimally sorted. Figure 2 demonstrates this result. We construct Figure
2 by simulating a pair of wages for each of one million individuals and assigning that
individual to the occupation that gives her the highest utility.

We then plot the

conditional wage distribution for each occupation (i.e., conditional upon workers having
optimally sorted into that sector). Note that, consistent with the predictions of the Roy
model, the means of both distributions increase while their variances decrease.
Importantly, the difference in the means of the two conditional distributions (1.57-0.57 =
1.00) still reflects the true compensating wage differential from which we could derive an
unbiased measure of the value of a statistical life. This is because that difference is
deducted from utility before Roy sorting occurs and is therefore not distorted by the
sorting process.
Now consider a minor modification of the sorting model in equations (1) and (2).
In particular, suppose the variance of the unconditional wage distribution in occupation
#1 (i.e., the “safe” occupation) is greater than that in occupation #2.


 i,2 
  

Figure 3 shows that the difference in the means of the unconditional wage distributions
still reveals the true compensating wage differential. However, when individuals sort,
occupation #1 offers greater opportunities for very high wage draws (large idiosyncratic
returns). Optimal sorting yields a bigger upward shift in the mean of the occupation #1
conditional wage distribution. Comparing the means of the two conditional distributions
in Figure 4 reveals a downward bias in the estimate of the compensating differential
(1.46-0.92 = 0.54), implying an understated VSL.
This sorting-induced bias is compounded if individuals’ wage draws are positively
correlated across occupations. Consider an extreme case:

(5)

  0   2 0.9  
 ε i ,1 


 ε  ~ i.i.d . N   0 ,  0.9 1  

 i,2 
  

Now, the individuals receiving the highest draws in occupation #1 tend to be those
individuals who would have received a draw from the upper tail of the occupation #2
wage distribution. Those left in occupation #2 tend to be those individuals who receive
low draws in both occupations. Figure 5 illustrates that this further compresses the
difference in the means of the conditional wage distributions (i.e., down to 1.07-0.80 =
0.27), making the sorting-induced downward bias in the implied VSL even more severe.
The opposite is true if wage draws are negatively correlated across occupations:

6

(6)

  0  2

 ε i ,1 

 ε  ~ i.i.d . N   0 ,  − 0.9
1  
 i,2 
  

although in this example, the negative correlation is not strong enough to offset the initial
sorting bias. Figure 6 illustrates this case, in which the compensating differential only
falls to 1.69-1.06 = 0.63.

2.1 Recovering the VSL in the Presence of Roy Sorting
In these numerical examples, the direction and size of the bias induced by Roy
sorting depends upon the relative sizes of the variances of the unconditional wage
distributions in combination with the correlation of individuals’ wage draws across
occupations.4 Heckman and Honoré (1990), however, prove that these unconditional
distributions cannot be recovered without first assuming a value for the correlation in
individuals’ wage draws across occupations (e.g., independence).

This leaves the

researcher in a difficult position with respect to the bias in the wage-hedonic estimate of
the VSL induced by Roy sorting – one needs to first assume a degree of correlation in
wage draws in order to recover the unconditional wage distributions, but the degree of
correlation itself affects the size of the bias induced by Roy sorting. In Section 5, we
demonstrate how one can avoid this problem and correct the sorting bias in the VSL (i)
without knowing the unconditional wage distributions and (ii) without assuming anything
about the correlation in individuals’ wage draws across occupations. This procedure

4

In particular, by making the variance in occupation #2 larger than that in occupation #1, we could have
made the bias in the VSL go in the opposite direction.

7

yields an estimate of the VSL that is three times larger than that derived from the
traditional wage-hedonic technique.
While straightforward, that estimator does require a lot from the data – in
particular, estimates of the minimum order statistics associated with each of a number of
conditional wage distributions.

While the quality of the wage data we use in our

empirical application is quite high, we concede that measurement error and outliers can
make it difficult to accurately estimate the minimum order statistic. We subsequently
offer a second estimation strategy in section 7 that requires far less of the data. Instead of
focusing on the minimum order statistic, it uses information from the entire conditional
wage distribution, but requires an assumption of independent wage draws across sectors.
That procedure recovers an estimate of the VSL that is more than four times the size of
that derived from the comparable wage-hedonic regression. We take the results of these
two models as convincing evidence that Roy sorting matters, and leave it to the reader to
determine which method is more appropriate for any particular application.

3. OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THE WAGE-HEDONIC ESTIMATE OF THE VSL
The wage-hedonic technique has been used extensively (and has been rigorously
scrutinized) for decades.

We present only a brief overview of the resulting large

literature. Viscusi and Aldy (2003) provide a comprehensive discussion of the VSL,
paying particular attention to the wage-hedonic technique and the problems that can arise
in its implementation.

Consider, for example, the role of unobservable individual

heterogeneity. One particular form of such heterogeneity is worker productivity. Hwang
et al (1992) demonstrate that if workers can be classified as high or low productivity (i.e.,

8

if there is positive correlation in wage draws across occupations) and if high productivity
workers choose to take some of their compensation in the form of lower fatality risk,
wages in low-risk occupations will look too high and the estimated fatality risk premium
will be too low.

This problem has been addressed in earlier work by the use of

longitudinal data, identifying individual fixed effects with either (i) workers who switch
jobs or (ii) time-varying fatality rates within a job. [See, for example, Brown (1980),
Black and Kneisner (2003), and Kniesner et al (2006)] The first estimation approach we
describe below will, conveniently, account for this source of bias in that (i) it assumes
workers take account of both wages and job attributes (including fatality risk) when
choosing an occupation, and (ii) it is robust to any form of correlation in workers’ wage
draws (i.e., workers can have differing productivities). Like the previous literature, our
second estimator requires longitudinal data to address this issue.
A separate problem arises if there is unobservable heterogeneity in individuals’
ability to avoid risk. Shogren and Stamland (2002) note that estimates of the VSL will be
biased upward if there is heterogeneity in unobservable safety-related skills.

The

presence of safety-related skills means that not all workers face the same risk on the same
job – alternatively, some workers may simply be better at avoiding accidents than others.
The compensating differential is determined by the marginal worker, who will have the
least amount of safety-related skill among workers in the risky job and thus will face the
highest risk. If the average risk faced by workers in the risky job is instead used to
calculate the estimate of the VSL, that estimate will be biased upward. Our estimators, in
their current form, are unable to allow for idiosyncratic exposure to risk.

9

A third problem arises when individuals have heterogeneous preferences for risk.
In particular, workers who put less value on safety are more likely to sort into risky jobs,
biasing downward wage-hedonic estimates of the compensating risk premium. While
panel data and individual fixed effects provide one solution to this sort of preferencebased sorting, researchers have also used information about seatbelt use [Hersch and
Viscusi (1990), Hersch and Pickton (1995)] or smoking behavior [Viscusi and Hersch
(2001)] to control for risk preferences. While we do not employ data of this sort, our
estimation approaches do permit distaste for fatality risk to be controlled for with these
sorts of observable characteristics.5
There are a number of other problems that may arise when using wage-hedonics to
measure the VSL. For example, wage-hedonic techniques often ignore quality of life
impacts, as well as the effects of life expectancy.6 They usually measure the disutility of
facing a particular kind of death that is neither slow nor protracted, and which does not
involve a significant latency period. These techniques may not, therefore, be good for
valuing avoided deaths from cancer. [Savage (1993), Revesz (1999)] Scotten and Taylor
(2007) demonstrate that one should not even treat different sources of on-the-job fatality
risk (e.g., accidental, transportation related, and death from violent assault) homogenously
in a wage-hedonic equation.

Because they focus on labor market outcomes, wage-

hedonic techniques are not useful for valuing the lives of children and the elderly. For
these and other problems, there are a variety of alternative techniques for calculating
5

DeLeire and Levy (2004) provide empirical support for the notion that workers who, based on their
observable characteristics such as sex, marital status, and whether they have children, likely have a greater
distaste for dangerous work tend to choose safer occupations.
6
Notable exceptions include Viscusi and Aldy (2006), who find that VSLs follow an inverted-U pattern in
age, and Alberini et al (2004), who find lower VSLs for those over the age of 70 using stated preference
techniques. Other researchers have also found that the VSL declines at higher ages – see Table 10 in
Viscusi and Aldy (2003) for a summary. In contrast, Smith et al (2004) find no evidence of lower VSLs for
older individuals.

10

VSLs including stated preference, human capital approaches, and quantifying the risk
tradeoffs agents make in non-labor market settings.7 Finally, it is unclear how well actual
on-the-job fatality risks proxy for the risks a worker perceives when he decides to accept
or reject a wage offer.
Even with all these problems, wage-hedonics remains prevalent in policy making.
The EPA has recently reduced the VSL it uses for policy analysis to $7.22 million from
$8.04 million. This reduction will have important implications for which policies pass
EPA cost-benefit analysis. Both numbers are based on meta-analyses of a variety of VSL
studies, many of which used wage-hedonic techniques.

4. DATA
We use data from three different sources for both of our estimation strategies.
First, we use data on hourly wage rates and occupations from the Outgoing Rotation
Groups of the Current Population Surveys (CPS). Second, we use data on fatal and nonfatal risks associated with each occupation that we construct by merging Bureau of Labor
Statistics data on injuries and deaths with CPS data in a procedure described below.
Third, we use data on the occupational characteristics (besides injury risks) from the
Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT).

7

Ashenfelter and Greenstone (2004), for example, use states’ decisions to raise speed limits as evidence
that the median voter was willing to incur an increased risk of driver death in exchange for lower travel
times. Atkinson and Halvorsen (1990), Dreyfus and Viscusi (1995), and Li (2006) look at the willingness
of automobile buyers to trade-off risk of death with operating expenditures and purchase price. Blomquist
(1979) and Hakes and Viscusi (2007) use drivers’ decisions to employ seatbelts in order to recover
estimates of the VSL, and Carlin and Sandy (1991) do so with data on individuals’ decisions to use child
safety seats. Portney (1981) and Gayer, Hamilton, and Viscusi (2000) use tradeoffs between housing
expenditures and mortality from air pollution and cancer (caused by proximity to Superfund sites),
respectively.

11

We record wages and occupations from the CPS Outgoing Rotation Groups
Surveys from 1983 through 2002. We restrict the data to these years because 1983 and
2002 are the first and last years that the 1980 occupational classification was used in the
CPS. In particular, to determine occupation we use responses to the question “What kind
of work was … doing [last week]?” Our sample includes all individuals who were
employed during the survey week. This yields data on 3,434,820 workers.
We assign fatal and non-fatal injury risks to each occupation using data from the
BLS Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses and the Census of Fatal Occupational
Injuries. These data provide counts of injuries and fatalities at the 3-digit occupation
level from 1992 to 1999; there is also information on the severity of non-fatal injuries,
including the median number of days missed from work per injury within an occupation.8
In some cases the data are aggregated across 3-digit occupations; we aggregate all data to
correspond to the 2-digit detailed occupation recodes in the CPS.9 We use monthly CPS
data to calculate hours worked over this period in each category to transform the counts
into risks (the number of injuries per 100 full-time workers).10

We also calculate

“anticipated” days of work lost due to nonfatal injury by multiplying the risk of nonfatal
injury by the median days lost per injury within an occupation. We then average over the
period 1992-1999 in order to minimize the effects of year-to-year noise (as we
demonstrate below, we do not need time variation in fatality risk for identification, even
without assuming independence). Average annual risk of death on the job is 0.005 for all
8

Note that simply being able to miss days from work after a non-fatal injury may be a positive amenity
associated with many jobs.
9
The categories do not correspond perfectly to the Census detailed occupation recodes; we collapse codes
40, 41, and 42 into a single category since the fatality data are not available for these categories in a way
that can be disaggregated.
10
A full-time worker is assumed to work 2,000 hours/year, so that the risks we calculate are per 200,000
hours worked.

12

men (or one for every 25,000 men) and 0.002 for all women (or one for every 50,000
women).
We also use data on other job attributes from the Dictionary of Occupational
Titles. The DOT is a reference manual compiled by the U.S. Department of Labor that
provides information about occupations. It attempts both to define occupations in a
uniform way across industries and to assess the characteristics of occupations. While the
occupational characteristics in the DOT were not collected from a nationally
representative survey of firms and little detail on sampling or response rates is available,
they are the best data available on the characteristics of occupations. The analysis of
occupational characteristics was conducted through on-site observation and interviews
with employees. The DOT data were constructed by analysts assigning numerical codes
to 43 job traits. We create six aggregate variables from the underlying DOT variables to
describe occupational characteristics: substantive complexity, motor skills, physical
demands, working conditions, creative skills, and interactions with people. A detailed list
of the variables used to construct these data is provided in Table 1. Table 2 summarizes
the attributes of each occupation. The highest risk occupations (in order) are (1) forestry
and fishing, (2) motor vehicle operations, (3) other transportation occupations, (4) farm
workers, and (5) construction, freight, labor. All other occupations average fewer than
one death per 10,000 workers each year.
The data used to construct hourly wage rates for our analyses come from the
Bureau of the Census, Current Population Survey, Outgoing Rotation Groups files from
1983 through 2002. Wages are inflated to 2005 dollars using the CPI-U-RS. Workers’
hourly wage rates are either (i) the reported hourly wage (for the 60 percent of workers

13

paid on that basis) or (ii) weekly earnings divided by weekly hours (for the other 40
percent of workers).11 To avoid measurement error from using wages derived from salary
and “usual” hours data, we drop the latter group of workers for our primary analysis.12
The focus of our investigation is therefore on “hourly” workers. This group has received
much of the attention in previous VSL studies. [Viscusi and Aldy (2003)]
Table 3 summarizes the data describing hourly workers. In particular, the table
reports means for attributes of men and women, broken down according to whether the
individual works in a high or low risk occupation.13 There are a few interesting points
that can be made simply by looking at these raw data. Men in high risk occupations earn
more on average than those in low risk occupations, even though the latter are more likely
to be college educated. This suggests the sort of variation in the data that would yield a
positive VSL. Men in high risk occupations are, however, also more likely to be older,
married, union members, fulltime workers, and white – all of which are factors that would
likely contribute to their being paid a higher wage. This highlights the importance of
controlling for individual heterogeneity when applying our estimators. We describe how
this is done in the following section.
Unlike their male counterparts, women in high risk occupations tend to earn lower
wages. Like men, women with any college training are less likely to work in those jobs.
Across most other attributes, women are similar irrespective of whether they work in a

11

Imputed data on wage rates were used to describe some hourly workers. In cases where individuals do
not provide complete responses to the Census Bureau interviewers, the Census Bureau imputes the missing
data using the information provided by a different respondent with some of the same characteristics, when
those characteristics were likely to be associated with the missing data.
12
In Section 6.2, we do report a separate set of results for salaried workers.
13
The individual is considered to be in a high risk occupation if that occupation has fatality risk above the
median risk across all 43 occupations (i.e., 1.571 deaths per 100,000 workers each year).

14

high or low risk occupation. Finally, note that 83% of men work in occupations classified
as high risk, while only 35% of women do so.

5. ESTIMATION STRATEGY 1: IDENTIFICATION
We begin by describing our identification strategy with a simple model of sorting
by individuals into one of two occupations (j = 1, 2). We indicate the wage earned by
individual i should he choose to work in occupation #1 or #2 as ωi,1 and ωi,2, respectively.
In contrast to the classic Roy model, where sorting across occupations is driven entirely
by an individual’s pecuniary compensation, we model sorting as determined by his wage
draw in each occupation and by non-wage determinants of utility specific to each
particular occupation. We summarize the latter (for now) as “tastes”. The conventional
wisdom is that there is no additional information in conditional wage distributions with
which to identify these taste parameters. In the following model, we show how they are,
in fact, identified with the help of a simple assumption.
We begin by modeling individual i’s utility from choosing occupation j as the sum
of wages (ωi,j) and tastes (τj):

(7)

U i, j = ωi, j + τ j

The first important restriction we impose on the model is that there is no idiosyncratic
component to the taste parameter (i.e., we estimate τj instead of τi,j).14

14

After first

By estimating this model separately for different types of individuals, it is possible to allow the taste to
vary with observable individual attributes. However, allowing tastes to vary with unobservable individual
attributes does not appear to be possible without relying on strict distributional assumptions. Our goal is to
demonstrate how identification can be achieved without resorting to such distributional assumptions.

15

explaining how to recover estimates of these taste parameters, we describe how they can
be used to recover the value workers place on particular non-pecuniary occupation
attributes (e.g., fatality risk).
Without loss of generality, we normalize τ1 = 0.15 At this point, the goal of our
exercise is to recover an estimate of τ2.16 The difficulty in doing so arises from the fact
that we only see (i) wage distributions conditional upon optimal sorting behavior, and (ii)
an indicator of which occupation an individual chooses. In particular, for an individual i,
we only observe ωi,2 if:

(8)

ω i , 2 + τ 2 ≥ ω i ,1

Alternatively, we only observe ωi,1 if:

(9)

ω i , 2 + τ 2 < ω i ,1

Denote the smallest wage (i.e., the minimum order statistic, or extreme quantile) that we
observe from someone choosing occupation #1 or #2 by w1 and w 2 , respectively.
Assuming that the unconditional distributions of ω1 and ω2 have finite lower points of
supports (denoted by ω1* and ω 2* ), we know the smallest value of ω1 that we could ever
see, given that individuals maximize utility:

15

As in all random-utility frameworks, utility is only identified up to an additive constant. This requires
some sort of a normalization, which we use to eliminate one of the τ’s from the two-occupation example. In
the more general N occupation case, we estimate (N-1) distinct τ’s.
16
Bayer, Khan, and Timmins (2007) describe how non-parametric estimates of the unconditional wage
distributions can be recovered as well.

w1 = ω 2* + τ 2

if

ω1* ≤ ω 2* + τ 2

Similarly, the smallest value of ω2 that we could ever observe would be:

(11)

w 2 = ω 2*

if

ω1* ≤ ω 2* + τ 2

w 2 = ω1* − τ 2

if

ω1* > ω 2* + τ 2

In order to make sense of (10) and (11), define the following two cases:

(12)

A : ω1* > ω 2* + τ 2
B : ω1* ≤ ω 2* + τ 2

We are not able to tell whether case A or B prevails in the data without first recovering an
estimate of τ2, which is the object of the estimation procedure. Conveniently, we are able
to recover an estimate of τ2 in either case.17 In particular:

(13)

τ 2 = w1 − w 2

Equation (13) therefore describes our minimum order statistic estimator for τ2 in the
simplest two-occupation case. Figures 7 and 8 illustrate the intuition underlying this
17

By exploiting information contained in the extreme tails of the wage distribution, this approach has much
in common with the “identification at infinity” strategy for estimating treatment effects under selection
described in Heckman (1990).

estimator for cases A and B, respectively.

The heavy dashed lines in each figure

correspond to the minimum order statistics that would be observed in the data (i.e.,
w1 = ω1* and w 2 = ω1* − τ 2 in case A, and w1 = ω 2* + τ 2 and w 2 = ω 2* in case B). In each

case, the difference between the heavy dashed lines identifies τ2.
We reiterate at this point that, at no point in the preceding discussion were we
required to say anything about the relative sizes of the variances of wage draws across
occupations or the correlation in an individual’s wage draws across occupations.
Correlations that are positive, negative, or zero are all consistent with this model.
Identification relies only on differences in the supports of different conditional wage
distributions.
The theory used to describe the simple two-occupation case scales-up naturally to
any number of potential occupations.

With more than two potential occupations,

however, we require some additional notation. Consider the following three-occupation
system with wages for individual i denoted by ω1,i, ω2,i, and ω3,i. We denote the lower
supports of each occupation’s wage distribution by ω1* , ω 2* , and ω 3* . We therefore
normalize τ1 = 0. For individual i, we observe wi, where:

wi

(14)

= ω1,i I [ω1,i > max (ω 2,i + τ 2 , ω 3,i + τ 3 )] +

ω 2,i I [ω 2,i + τ 2 > max (ω1,i , ω 3,i + τ 3 )] +
ω 3,i I [ω 3,i + τ 3 > max (ω1,i , ω 2,i + τ 2 )]

We also observe an indicator corresponding to which occupation individual i has selected
– i.e., d1,i, d2,i, and d3,i. We note that, under convex supports for all random variables and

18

assuming finite lower support points ( ω1* , ω 2* , ω 3* ), we have the following conditional
minimum order statistics:

w1 = min ( wi | d1,i = 1) = max (ω1* , ω 2* + τ 2 , ω 3* + τ 3 )
(15)

w 2 = min ( wi | d 2,i = 1) = max (ω1* , ω 2* + τ 2 , ω 3* + τ 3 ) − τ 2
w 3 = min ( wi | d 3,i = 1) = max (ω1* , ω 2* + τ 2 , ω 3* + τ 3 ) − τ 3

Notice that τ3 is equal to ( w1 − w 3 ) , while τ2 is equal to ( w1 − w 2 ) .
With estimates of τ for multiple occupations j = 1, 2, …, it becomes possible to
decompose the taste parameter into the utility effects of multiple non-pecuniary
occupation characteristics, X (including fatality risk), along with an unobserved
occupation attribute, εj, by way of regression analysis.18

(16)

τ j = X ′j β + ε j

6. ESTIMATION STRATEGY 1: RESULTS
In this section, we describe the results of two sets of estimation procedures. The
first is based on the traditional wage-hedonic model for recovering marginal willingnessto-pay for reductions in fatality risk. In particular, we estimate a regression of the form:
18

This assumes, of course, that E[εX] = 0, which may be violated if there are important omitted job
characteristics. In our application, we deal with this concern directly by employing the best available data
describing occupation attributes. Alternatively, if one believed that correlated unobservable job attributes
were time invariant, and if one could exploit time variation in fatality risk, it would be possible to estimate
multiple taste parameters (i.e., a different vector for each time period), pool them over time, and include
occupation fixed effects in equation (16) to deal with the endogeneity. See, for example, the data used by
Costa and Kahn (2004) in their analysis of changes in the VSL from 1940-1980.

INTPEOPLE Worker interactions with people.

The main variable of interest is the fatality risk associated with occupation j, represented
by FATAL (the number of deaths per 100 full-time workers) which we defined above.
Recognizing that the value placed on certain job attributes may differ with worker
attributes, we also estimate a regression of the form:

(18)

wi , j = α 0 + Z i′α 1 + α 2 FATAL j + X ′jα 3 + ( X j d coll )′α 4 + ( X j d AGE > 40 )′α 5 + ε i , j

where dcoll is a dummy variable indicating that SOMECOLL = 1 or COLLGRAD = 1, and
dAGE>40 is a dummy variable indicating that the individual is over 40 years of age. At this
stage of the analysis, we restrict our estimate of the compensating differential in wages
(and, hence, the VSL) to be constant across worker attributes.

21

We then take the estimate of the marginal willingness-to-pay to avoid fatality risk,

α2, and scale this up by a typical number of hours worked in a year (2,000) and by the
number of workers over whom the annual fatality risk was measured (100). This provides
us with our estimated VSL.
Table 4a describes the results of regression equations (17) and (18) for both men
and women where the dependent variable is the hourly wage. Table 4b describes the
corresponding results where the dependent variable is the log hourly wage. In each case,
we estimate two specifications – one in which we use worker-occupation attribute
interactions, and another in which we do not. All results reported in this section of the
paper are based on a trimmed sample that drops all individuals reporting wages lower
than the federally mandated minimum wage in the year of observation.20,

21

95 percent

confidence intervals, which were calculated allowing for clustering at the occupation
level, were computed using an M/N bootstrap method.

6.1. Minimum Order Statistic Estimator
We carry-out a comparable set of specifications of our minimum order statistic
estimator. The practical difficulty in applying this estimator in the current context arises
in controlling for the rich set of worker attributes provided by the CPS. One alternative is
to divide the data up into very small groups and apply the estimator non-parametrically to
each group. An advantage of doing so would be that we would be able to estimate taste

20

In many years, CPS wages are top-coded at a nominal value of $99.99. We drop all observations
nominally at or above this top-coded value in every year. Dropping observations with wages below the
federally mandated minimum wage reduces the influence of mismeasured wages, particularly in the lower
tail of the wage distribution. Results without lower trimming are reported in the sub-section 6.2.
21
Keep in mind that, in the traditional wage-hedonic model, a disamenity enters the wage equation
positively, indicating a positive wage differential paid to compensate for the unattractive job attribute.

22

parameters that vary with observable individual attributes. The problem that arises,
however, is that for a particular group (e.g., black, non-Hispanic, married men aged 18-30
with a high-school education, living in an MSA in New England, who are fulltime
workers but not in the public sector), we may be unlikely to see many individuals in a
particular occupation (e.g., machine operators). The estimator becomes very sensitive to
the wages of the few individuals we do see, and fails if we see no workers in a group.
Alternatively, we could choose not to control for individual attributes at all, but then we
would be deriving our measure of the VSL from the wages and occupation choices of a
potentially unrepresentative group. We therefore adopt a two-stage estimation procedure
that introduces some parametric modeling.22 We first estimate a regression of the form:

(19)

wˆ i , j = β 0 + Z i′β 1 + u i , j

where wˆ i , j is individual i’s observed wage in occupation j, having differenced out the
mean of all wages earned by workers in occupation j. ξi,j measures worker i’s wage in
occupation j, purged of the effects of observable individual attributes Zi:23

(20)

ξ i , j = wi , j − β 0 − Z i′β 1

22

This two-step approach is similar to that employed by Bajari and Kahn (2005), who face a similar
problem of needing to perform non-parametric estimation with an abundance of covariates.
23
Note that we use wi,j, not wˆ i , j , in deriving ξi,j. ξi,j should be purged of the effects of observable individual
attributes, but not of the level-effects attributable to being in different occupations.

23

We then use ξi,j as our “wage” in implementing the lower bound estimator. This allows
us to compare different individuals without having to divide them into unreasonably small
sub-groups.24
In particular, normalizing the taste parameter for a large occupation (i.e.,
occupation #34 – construction trades) to be zero, we recover estimates of the taste
parameters for the remaining sectors according to the formula:

(21)

τ j = ξ 34 − ξ j

and carry out the second-stage regression to recover the value of non-pecuniary job
attributes:

(22)

τ j = θ + β 2 FATAL j + X ′j β 3 + υ j

where θ accounts for the arbitrary choice of normalization in deriving the τ’s. In a final
specification, we also include interactions between Xj and dcoll and between Xj and dAGE>40
in the estimation of equation (19).
We rely on M/N bootstrapping techniques to recover confidence intervals.25 In
particular, we conduct 1000 M/N bootstrap simulations of each specification, from which

24

This assumption does impose the constraint that job attributes and worker characteristics enter additively
in determining a worker’s wage. This is restrictive, but not significantly different from the assumption
usually maintained in the VSL literature. We have also estimated specifications that relax this assumption
as well as specifications that allow the effect of worker characteristics to vary by occupation. These
specifications, available upon request, yield minimum order statistics that are very similar to those obtained
from the specification presented in this paper.
25
Inference is complicated by the fact that the lower bound estimator does not have an asymptotically
normal distribution. The traditional bootstrap algorithm, moreover, is invalid when the estimate is not

24

we derive symmetric 95% confidence intervals.26

Results are consistent with

expectations – workers exhibit a strong and statistically significant disutility from
increased fatality risk.27
One might reasonably be concerned with the effect of measurement error and
outliers on the performance of this estimator. Put simply, if the differences between
minimum order statistics are driven by outliers or mismeasured data, this will filter
through the model and drive our point estimate of the marginal utility associated with
each job attribute. We take comfort, however, from the fact that our estimates are nearly
always statistically significant. If our estimates were, in fact, being driven by outliers or
many forms of measurement error, we would expect this to be reflected in large standard
errors calculated by our bootstrap procedure.28
Tables 5 and 6 report the results of our minimum-order-statistic estimator, for both
men and women. The first and third columns refer to the specification that does not
include worker-occupation attribute interactions; the second and fourth columns include
these interactions. Tables 5a and 5b report results where the dependent variable was the
hourly wage while Tables 6a and 6b report results where the dependent variable was the
log hourly wage. Tables 5a and 6a reports results for equation (19), while Tables 5b and
asymptotically normal. This problem is overcome by the use of the M/N bootstrap, a variant on subsampling (here, we use bootstrapped sub-samples that are ¼ the size of the full data set). While yielding
inefficient (i.e., overly large) estimates of the confidence interval, the M/N bootstrap does produce
confidence interval estimates that are consistent.
26
Specifically, a bootstrap simulation consists of taking a random ¼ sub-sample (drawn with replacement)
from the population of ξi,j’s. We then determine the values of τj, j = 1, 2,…, 43, and regress these values on
the vector of occupation attributes. We record the resulting estimates and repeat the entire process 1000
times. The bootstrapped confidence interval is then found by taking the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the
distribution of bootstrapped parameter estimates.
27
In contrast to the traditional wage-hedonic model, we are here estimating structural utility function
parameters. Disutility is therefore indicated by a negative parameter value. Recall, moreover, that these
parameter estimates are already normalized by the marginal utility of wages, so that they can be interpreted
as marginal willingnesses-to-pay, and are comparable across sub-populations.
28
That is, any particular M/N sample would be unlikely to contain the problematic observation, producing a
very different point estimate.

25

6b reports the results of equation (22). Also reported are 95% confidence intervals
derived from the M/N bootstrap.
Table 7a summarizes the VSL estimates from both the traditional wage hedonic
and minimum order statistic estimation techniques for each of the specifications described
above when the dependent variable wage the hourly wage.

Looking only at point

estimates for men, the minimum order statistic estimator produces VSL estimates that are
2.7 and 4.3 times greater than those produced by the traditional wage hedonic procedure.
The minimum order statistic estimates are, moreover, statistically significant with a 95%
confidence interval ranging from approximately $5 million to almost $16 million.
For women, the difference between the two models is even starker. The minimum
order statistic estimator yields results that are similar to those for men – $7.95 or $11.76
million, depending upon whether worker-occupation attribute interactions are included in
the first-stage estimation.

Moreover, these results are statistically significant.

By

contrast, the wage-hedonic procedure yields negative VSL point estimates for women. In
all cases, we can reject the hypothesis that the VSLs estimated by traditional wagehedonic methods are equal to those estimated from minimum order statistics.
The log-wage hedonic specification (see Table 7b) yields estimates of the VSL for
men that are even lower (approximately $1.02 to $1.75 million) and yields estimates of
the VSL for women that are also negative (approximately -$8.59 million). The minimum
order statistic estimates of the VSL are larger for men (between $9 and $10 million) and
positive for women (between $3.7 and $7.5 million). Again, we can reject the hypothesis
that the VSLs estimated by traditional wage-hedonic methods are equal to those estimated
from minimum order statistics.

26

6.2 Alternative Specifications
Because our estimator is based on the minimum order statistic, it is possible that
our results may be sensitive to the particular choice of model specification (including the
criteria used to draw a data sample). In this sub-section, we explore that sensitivity with a
variety of alternative specifications. Tables 8a and 8b report the VSL estimates arising
from twelve alternatives. We note at the outset that in these subsamples, the traditional
wage-hedonic procedure typically does not produce a statistically significant estimate,
and for women, most of the point-estimates have the wrong sign. Table 8a reports the
results from the hourly wage specifications while Table 8b reports the results from the log
hourly wage specifications. The first row of Table 8a reports estimates based on the
sample of salaried workers. Minimum order statistic estimates remain significant, but fall
relative to their values for wage workers (more so for men than for women). Wagehedonic estimates, on the other hand, rise dramatically but have large confidence
intervals. The second row reports results based on a sample of hourly workers that does
not drop those reporting wages below the federally mandated minimum. These low
wages may be real observations, but might also simply reflect measurement error.
Including these low wages has the effect of collapsing across-occupation variation at the
bottom of the wage distribution, with the effect of reducing the VSL estimate based on
the minimum order statistic. Even with this reduction, however, the estimate is still
statistically significant and larger than that based on the traditional wage hedonic
technique.

27

The next four rows describe results based on samples drawn to include only
individuals in a certain age range.29,30 In particular, we perform the exact same estimation
procedure described in the previous sub-section (including estimating parameters on AGE
and AGE2), but do so only on a sub-set of workers (e.g., aged 20 to 29). It is reassuring
that the same inverted-U pattern found in previous work is apparent in our results. The
inverted-U is, moreover, shifted upward for the minimum order statistic estimates relative
to the wage-hedonic estimates.
The next two rows describe how the VSL varies with marital status. Using the
minimum order statistic estimator, we find that married men have a higher VSL. This
difference goes away when considering women, and is not present for men or women
when using the traditional wage-hedonic estimator.
The next two rows describe how the VSL estimates vary with the time period of
analysis. If we restrict our data to the 1983 to 1992 period, we obtain larger estimates for
men of the VSL based on minimum order statistics while if we restrict the data to the
1993 to 2002 period, we get smaller estimates for men. For women, the estimates of the
VSL based on minimum order statistics are, by contrast, larger in the latter period.
The final two rows of Tables 8a and 8b illustrate two cases in which our model
may not perform well. In the first, we restrict ourselves to using a limited set of worker
attributes (AGE, AGE2, HSDROP, SOMECOLL, COLLGRAD). This has the effect of
reducing the variability across occupations in the lower bound of our wage distributions.31

29

In these results (and in the remainder of the results in this section), we use the trimmed sample of hourly
workers as a starting point.
30
Besides age, researchers have also calculated VSLs that differ with respect to race [Viscusi (2003)],
income, and union status [summarized in Viscusi and Aldy (2003)].
31
Consider an extreme example. When we trim all observations below the federally mandated minimum
wage and use no covariates, it will likely be the case that there is no variation at all across sectors in the

28

The result is to provide a sort of lower bound on the VSL estimate. While the minimum
order statistic estimate falls below that found with the wage-hedonic model, it does
remain statistically significant. This result highlights the importance of explaining as
much of the variation in wages as possible with observable worker attributes.
The final row illustrates the effects of having little cross-occupation variation in
fatality risk. In particular, we eliminate the relatively risky occupation categories #41 #43 (i.e., farm managers, farm workers, and forestry & fishing). The result is to increase
the confidence intervals for the estimates derived from both techniques (particularly for
the minimum order statistic estimator). The change has little effect on the point estimate
for men based on the wage-hedonic technique, but the point estimate based on the
minimum order statistic jumps dramatically.

7. ESTIMATION STRATEGY 2
While the CPS provides high-quality data on wages, one might generally be
concerned about the potential for measurement error or outliers to prevent us from
accurately measuring the true minimum order statistic. A similar concern might arise in
settings where one has a relatively small sample to work with. In this section, we employ
an alternative estimation strategy that instead uses data from the entire conditional wage
distribution and makes no assumption about the distributions’ supports. [Bayer, Khan,
and Timmins (2007)] Instead, it relies upon two alternative identifying assumptions: (i)

lower point of support. The VSL recovered with our minimum order statistic estimator would therefore be
$0.

29

the unconditional distribution of log-wage in occupation j is normal with mean µ j and
variance σ 2j , and (ii) wage draws for individual i are independent across occupations.32
To explain this estimator, we return to the simple model of individuals sorting
over two occupations, indexed by #1 and #2. Without loss of generality, we again
normalize the taste for occupation #1 to zero (τ1 = 0). We define a variable di, which
functions as an indicator that individual i chose occupation #1:

(23)

d i = I [ω1,i > ω 2,i + τ 2 ]

Using this indicator, we can write down an expression for individual i’s observed wage:

(24)

wi = d i ω1,i + (1 − d i )ω 2,i

i.e., the individual receives his draw from occupation #1 if it was utility maximizing to
choose that occupation. Next, define the following joint probability distributions, both of
which are easily observed in the data:

(25)

Ψ1 (t ) = P (d i = 1, wi ≤ t )

Ψ2 (t ) = P (d i = 0, wi ≤ t )

We will also work with the derivatives of these expressions, denoted by:

32

This same assumption underlies the traditional wage-hedonic model estimated with cross-sectional data
(with panel data, individual fixed effects have been used to control for unobserved worker productivity).
With panel data, we could relax the independence assumption in our model as well, as we could include
individual fixed effects amongst the individual characteristics in the estimation of equation (19).

Focusing on the expression for Ψ1(t), we exploit the assumption that wage draws
(conditional on observable individual attributes) are independent across sectors to re-write
it as follows:

Ψ1 (t ) = P (d i = 1, wi ≤ t )

(33)

λ1 (t ) =

f 1 (t )
ψ 1 (t )
=
F1 (t ) Ψ1 (t ) + Ψ2 (t − τ 2 )

32

where λ1(t) is a function of the unconditional wage distribution in location #1. (33) is a
single equation in two unknowns (λ1(t) and τ2) when evaluated at a particular value of t,
and it is therefore not surprising that we cannot identify both of these values without
making an additional assumption. Bayer, Khan, and Timmins (2007) show how the
equation can be estimated without parametric assumptions in a model of spatial sorting by
assuming that workers living in the same location receive a wage draw from the same
distribution irrespective of where they migrated from. That source of variation is not
available in the data used to recover the VSL. Instead, we make a parametric assumption
about F1(t). Assuming F1(t) is the cumulative normal distribution with mean µ1 and
variance σ12 would reduce equation (33) to three parameters. The number of parameters
does not increase, moreover, as we consider the expression evaluated at different values
of t. By forcing the equation to hold for many values of t, we therefore have more
equations than unknowns and can easily identify the model’s parameters.
The preceding arguments scale-up to any number of occupations (although the
denominator in the right-hand-side expression of (33) becomes more complicated). We
can, therefore, estimate the model in our occupational sorting context by forming a
minimum-distance criterion function based on equation (33).

In our application,

minimizing this objective function requires us to search over a high-dimensional
parameter space (i.e., forty-three means, forty-three variances, and forty-two taste
parameters, which could then be regressed on job attributes as in equation (16)).33 We
make one further simplifying assumption in order to facilitate estimation – that the taste
parameter can be written as a function of observable occupation attributes: τ j = X ′j β .

33

In this unrestricted specification, one of the taste parameters must still be normalized to zero.

33

We therefore need to only estimate eight β parameters instead of a separate τj for each
occupation.
Table 9 describes the outcome of this estimation procedure applied to the sample
of male hourly workers earning more than the federal minimum wage.34 We evaluate a
minimum distance criterion function based on (33) at 200 values of log-wages evenly
spaced between 0.25 and 4.25.35 Standard errors are bootstrapped from 800 re-samples.
Because we are modeling log-wages, the coefficient on fatality risk needs to be multiplied
by the wage rate before being converted into a VSL. We use the average wage rate in the
sample ($13.16). The result is a statistically significant VSL estimate of $8.05 million,
which is smaller than that recovered by our first estimator, but more than four times larger
than the comparable estimate from the wage-hedonic model in Table 7b (i.e., $1.756
million).
Although the assumptions and methodology used to arrive at this estimate differ
dramatically from those in the previous section, the result is remarkably similar.
Controlling for Roy sorting, we recover a VSL that is three to four times greater than that
derived from traditional wage-hedonics.

Taken together, the results of these two

methodological approaches lead us to conclude that the VSL based on traditional wagehedonic techniques is indeed biased downward by Roy sorting.

Specifically, we apply the procedure to the “purged” wage data that were created by removing the
variation in wages explained by observable worker attributes (i.e., ξi,j from equation (20)).
35
Bayer, Khan, and Timmins (2007) describe the details of this procedure. For example, we use normal
density kernels and a Silverman’s rule of thumb to approximate ψ j (t ) . Ψ j (t ) is measured nonparametrically as a step-function.

8. CONCLUSIONS
The effect of individual unobservable heterogeneity (i.e., productivity) on
estimates of the value of a statistical life has been addressed in previous work, but
occupational (Roy) sorting based on idiosyncratic returns is absent from the literature on
VSL. We demonstrate that this type of sorting has the potential to bias wage-hedonic
estimates of the VSL.

Recovering the size and direction of that bias is a difficult

empirical problem that depends partly upon the relative variances of the unconditional
sector-specific wage distributions.
We first demonstrate a way to deal with Roy sorting bias without recovering the
unconditional wage distributions and without relying upon distributional assumptions.
Doing so requires the relatively innocuous assumption that wage distributions have finite
lower bounds. In addition to controlling for the biases induced by Roy sorting, this nonparametric estimator also corrects for biases resulting from unobserved productivity, of
the sort described by Hwang et al (1992). It is, moreover, easy to use – everything
(except standard errors) can be calculated with a spreadsheet. Finally, it can be expanded
to use better data sets (e.g., a finer gradation of occupation/sector, like those used by
Kniesner et al (2006) or Scotten and Taylor (2007). In so doing, however, it does also
require the strong practical assumption that we can accurately measure the minimum
order statistic associated with conditional wage distribution. For some (small, noisy) data
sets, this will clearly not be the case. In response to this concern, we offer a second
estimation strategy that does not impose strict data requirements but that does require an
independence assumption on wage draws when using cross-sectional data.

The

conclusions of both models are that traditional wage-hedonic techniques yield

35

significantly downwardly biased estimates of the VSL.

That bias is big enough,

moreover, to matter for policy. Estimates for men rise by a factor of three or more while
estimates for women become positive and of similar magnitude as those for men. These
estimates suggest that substantially larger valuations should be used in cost-benefit
analyses of environmental, workplace, and job safety regulations than is current practice.
