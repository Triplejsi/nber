Social Capital and Urban Growth

NBER Working Paper No. 14374

JEL No. D0,H0,I0,J0,R0
ABSTRACT
Social capital is often place-specific while schooling is portable, so the prospect of migration may
reduce the returns to social capital and increase the returns to schooling. If social capital matters for
urban success, it is possible that an area can get caught in a bad equilibrium where the prospect of
out-migration reduces social capital investment and a lack of social capital investment makes out-migration
more appealing. We present a simple model of that process and then test its implications. We find
little evidence to suggest that social capital is correlated with either area growth or rates of out-migration.
We do, however, find significant differences in the returns to human capital across space, and a significant
pattern of skilled people disproportionately leaving declining areas. For people in declining areas,
the prospect of out-migration may increase the returns to investment in human capital, but it does not
seem to impact investment in social capital.

Introduction

Should national governments engage in place-based policies that direct resources towards
declining or poor regions? Standard results in urban economics suggest that place-based
policies are unlikely to enhance economic efficiency or prudently promote equity. Unsuccessful
places are generally less productive, so directing people towards those areas may reduce national
productivity, and transfers to poor areas may well help property owners and the prosperous more
than the less fortunate.

Roger Bolton has regularly put forward a contrarian point of view that suggests a greater role for
the central government in “place-making.” This view emphasizes the value of a “sense of
place,” which can be understood as a type of location-specific social capital. Social capital may
be built through a variety of local place-making activities such as group membership and
political activism. In Section III of this paper, we present a simple model of social capital
investment where the incentives to invest decline when individuals expect to leave their current
locale.

This feedback mechanism creates the possibility of multiple equilibria. In one equilibrium,
people expect to leave and therefore invest little in social capital. Low levels of social capital
then make an area less attractive and so people do end up leaving. In a second equilibrium,
people expect to stay and so invest more in social capital. In principle, this type of multiple
equilibria story could explain why geographic mobility is so much higher in the U.S. than in
Europe (as in Spilimbergo and Ubeda, 2004). This virtuous circle holds together because the
high level of social capital investment keeps people interested in staying in the area.

This model creates a defensible rationale for government subsidy of declining areas. By
increasing the attractiveness of an area, the central government raises the probability that an
individual will want to stay in that area, which in turn increases the degree of investment in
social capital. Government support for distressed areas can be seen as a means of subsidizing the
positive externalities associated with social capital investment. In principle, it is even possible

2

that government intervention could move the city from the bad equilibrium, where everyone
leaves and no one invests, to the good equilibrium, where people stay and invest.

While there is no doubt that theory can provide an intellectually coherent rationale for supporting
declining areas, it is less obvious that the model’s conditions for federal government support to
be beneficial are met in the real world. After all, providing incentives for geographic stability is
a more direct means of promoting social capital investment than propping up declining areas.
The home mortgage interest deduction, which promotes homeownership and reduces mobility,
can be seen as a policy meant to promote social capital (Glaeser and DiPasquale, 1999). If
human capital investments also create spillovers, and if the returns to human capital are higher
outside of declining regions, then propping up those regions will cause a reduction in human
capital investment that must be weighed against any gains from social capital investment.

After presenting our model, we turn to the data. We first note that there is a substantial
difference between cities that are in decline and cities with large out-migration probabilities.
Many quickly growing places, like Austin, Texas and Charlotte, North Carolina, have higher
emigration rates than America’s declining cities (naturally, they also have much higher inmigration rates). In these cases, high levels of emigration do not seem to be impeding whatever
is necessary for urban success.

We then turn to the cross-city evidence on the relationship between social capital and urban
decline. Across areas, there is little clear connection between low levels of social capital
investment and either population growth or out-migration rates. While the multiple equilibria
model may have an intuitive appeal, it is not true that declining areas are particularly short on
social capital. They are, however, particularly short on human capital.

We next consider the connection between social capital and geographic mobility. People who
are more mobile do seem to invest less in social capital, but there is more question about whether
reducing the out-migration rate from an area will increase its social capital investment. A simple
cross-sectional regression that looks at the connection between forms of social capital investment
and either area-level out-migration rates or area-level decline finds little connection. This makes
3

us question whether reducing area level decline or out-migration will, in fact, increase the level
of social capital in an area.

Finally, we turn to the connection between urban decline and human capital. There are
substantial differences across space in the returns to skill. For example, the returns to a college
degree are higher in denser places and in areas where more college graduates choose to live.
These facts suggest that the ability to move locations can increase the returns to becoming
educated in a less skilled city. It is also true that more skilled people are particularly likely to
leave declining urban areas. Propping up declining areas may reduce this exodus, which may
create positive externalities on the other residents of the declining area. However, this may also
have negative externalities on the areas that were attracting the high human capital workers. The
case for sorting policies to be efficient requires some evidence of non-linearities in human capital
externalities, and we know of no evidence supporting the existence of such non-linearities
(Glaeser and Gottlieb, 2008).

We do know, however, that the probability of finishing high school is higher in areas with higher
levels of emigration. Moreover, people with more education are more likely to flee declining
areas. This may support the view that restricting mobility out of declining areas will reduce the
incentive to invest in human capital, which could even hurt declining areas. If we are confident
about the existence of human capital externalities, but not confident about local non-linearities,
then there is likely to be a social cost from reduced human capital investment if we try to induce
people to stay in areas with low returns to human capital.

II.

People vs. Place; Social Capital vs. Human Capital

Urban and regional economists have long debated the relative merits of investment by the federal
government in people or places (e.g. Winnick, 1966). Economic logic typically suggests that
person-based policies, like subsidies to education or the Low Income Housing Tax Credit,
dominate place-based policies, such as the Model Cities Program and Empowerment Zones.
Place-based policies seem poorly targeted to help poorer people. After all, plenty of people in
poorer places aren’t poor and property owners tend to benefit significantly from policies that
4

make a particular locale more attractive. Moreover, there are many cases where place-based
thinking appears to have justified particularly wasteful infrastructure projects that yield little
social benefit to anyone.

The core theoretical tool of urban economics – the spatial equilibrium – pushes back against the
use of place-based policies as a tool for redistribution. The vital assumption of spatial
equilibrium models is that free migration across space and flexible housing prices ensure that
welfare levels are more or less equal in different areas. Central city Detroit may be poor, but it
also has low housing prices that offset that poverty. If welfare levels are more or less equal
across space, then there is no good equity rationale for redistributing income from richer places
to poorer places.

Admittedly, the distinction between place and people is often ambiguous. Many investments in
human capital, such as schools, are inherently rooted in a particular place. Moreover, even the
staunchest advocates of people-based policies accept that localities should invest in their own
places. However, the weight of economic writing has generally been against using federal
interventions to subsidize particular locations.

Roger Bolton is one of those rare economists who have intellectually defended place-making
policies. In many papers, Bolton has emphasized the enormous importance that places, or “sense
of place,” can have on people’s lives, and he is surely right to have done so. Figure 1 shows the
53 percent correlation between the share of people saying that they are either somewhat or very
happy in the General Social Survey and population growth in their metropolitan area in the
1990s. People in declining areas seem to be significantly less happy than people in areas that are
attracting new people. While this link seems to suggest the importance of place, that fact alone
does not suggest that growing areas should subsidize declining areas.

Bolton (1992) elegantly surveys the literature on people prosperity vs. place prosperity and then
offers three arguments for government policies to strengthen declining places.

Bolton’s first

argument is that people who do not currently live in a declining area may like to have the option

5

of migrating to a declining area. If the declining area is allowed to disappear, then that option
will disappear along with it.

On its own, this option value does not create a cross-jurisdictional externality. The fact that
outsiders may sometimes decide to move to an area will increase that area’s property values.
Local government policies that try to maximize those property values will make investments
recognizing the potential value of the area to outsiders. For centuries, local boosters have fought
for policies not only on the basis of their current need, but also because those policies may attract
more people to an area. There must be some added externality or coordination failure that turns
the option value of being able to move to an area into a reason to support it.

The second reason that Bolton gives for place-making policies is that there is a psychic
externality created by the economic health of a particular place. People outside that place may
have no desire to live in that place or even visit that location, but they are still better off knowing
that the place exists and is doing well. This type of argument is frequently made for subsidizing
national parks. This argument was also made for national subsidies of New Orleans after
Hurricane Katrina. It was alleged that the value of that historic city to the American national
consciousness made it reasonable to spend billions rebuilding it.

Bolton’s third argument is that taxpayers simply like supporting payments that build up
particular places. The third and second arguments are quite similar in that they both rely on
preferences for supporting particular places, and these preferences are inherently hard to observe.
Perhaps it is true that taxpayers like the idea of subsidizing inner cities and Appalachia for
immutable taste-based reasons, but this contention is obviously debatable and difficult to verify.
Moreover, it is also possible to take the view that such preferences are weak and malleable,
which makes them only moderately appropriate guides for public policy.

In this essay, we consider a fourth reason for place-based policies that is also based on Bolton’s
work: location-based externalities in human and social capital. These issues are particularly
appropriate in an essay written for Roger Bolton, since he has been a leader in bringing social
capital into regional economics (Bolton, 1992, 2003). Investments in social capital, which can
6

be thought of as social connections and institutions, are generally thought to have significant
externalities. Individuals who set up networks or invest in clubs are generally creating benefits
for the other members of those networks and clubs, as well as for themselves. The existence of
these externalities means that the private spatial equilibrium is unlikely to be optimal.

However, the mere presence of externalities, such as human capital spillovers or agglomeration
economies, does not lead to a clear spatial policy (Glaeser and Gottlieb, 2008). Moving skilled
people from one place to another may increase the productivity of the area where skilled people
are moving to, but it will correspondingly decrease the productivity of the area that is losing
skilled people. Without a clear non-linearity in these spillovers, government policies that favor
one region or another are as likely to cause harm as good.

The standard assumptions about social capital suggest that social capital externalities are more
likely to yield a strong spatial policy conclusion. We normally assume that most social capital
investments are linked to a specific place, and that the benefits of investment are more or less
lost with migration. As a result, high out-migration rates should reduce the level of investment
in local churches, hobby groups and political clubs. If we believe that there are significant
externalities associated with these investments, then high levels of mobility will create negative
externalities by destroying an area’s “sense of place” (Bolton, 1987).

In the next section of this paper, we present a model that gives conditions under which social
capital investment creates a case for subsidizing particular places. In the model, there is always
an advantage to propping up declining regions, because this reduces mobility and increases
social capital investment. However, subsidizing a declining region will in turn have negative
effects on human capital investment if the returns to human capital are higher in growing areas.
As such, the case for place-based policies pits social capital against human capital. In Section
IV, we turn to the question of whether the conditions for subsidizing declining places are likely
to be met in the real world.

III. Multiple Equilibria and Mobility
We consider a two-period model, where individuals have a first period of investment and then
choose whether to stay in their initial location or move. They can invest in their human capital
level, h, and their social capital, s. Both social and physical capital enhance individual welfare,
and in both cases there are complementarities across people.
The primary difference in the two forms of investment is that social capital is location-specific
while human capital is not. An individual who gets a college degree can take the skills that he or
she learns everywhere. An individual who invests in social connections within a specific place
cannot. In the first period, investment occurs, individuals learn their match quality with a
specific locale, and they must then decide whether or not to move to someplace else.
Utility for person i in location j in period two equals U (hi , hˆ j ) + V ( sij , sˆ j ) + ε ij , where hi is the
human capital investment for person i and ĥ j is the average human capital investment for all
people in location j. An individual’s place-specific social capital sij equals si , person i’s
investment in social capital, if person i is staying in the same place that he or she grew up, or 0 if
person i has moved. The term ŝ j refers to the average social capital of individuals living in area

j. The final noise term ε ij reflects person i’s idiosyncratic taste for living in this specific
community. We assume that U1 (hi , hˆ j ) > 0 , U 2 (hi , hˆ j ) ≥ 0 , U12 (hi , hˆ j ) ≥ 0 and that
U ii (hi , hˆ j ) + U12 (hi , hˆ j ) < 0 , where U k (hi , hˆ j ) refers to the derivative of U (.,.) with respect to its

kth argument. The same four conditions apply for the V (.,.) function, and we also assume
V (0, sˆ j ) = 0 .
The decisions about human capital, social capital, and mobility are made in period one to
maximize the value of:
(1) β (U (hi , hˆ j ) + V ( sij , sˆ j ) + ε ij ) − hi − si ,
where β represents the discount factor. We initially assume that individuals are homogeneous,
except for region-specific tastes.
8

We first consider a particularly simple version of the model. All individuals start off in one
place, location “1,” and there is a single other location where they could move, location “2”.
Since no one begins in location 2, there is no social capital in that area. Individuals do not know
their value of ε i1 before they invest in either form of capital, but they learn the value of ε i1
before choosing whether or not to migrate. The expected value of the idiosyncratic taste for the
second area equals εˆ2 , but the realized value is not known before migration decisions are made.
The equilibrium of the model is determined by the following equations. First, individuals who
know that they are moving will not invest in social capital. Individuals who are staying will
invest in social capital to the point where: βπV1 ( s, s ) = 1 , where π denotes the endogenous
probability they assign to staying in location one. We let s ∗ (π ) denote the value of s that
satisfies this equation. The human capital investment equation is that β U1 (h, h) = 1 . We let
h∗ denote the value of h that satisfies that equation.
Differentiation then gives us that π

V1 ( s, s )
∂s ∗
∂s ∗
. This expression includes
=β

∂π
∂β
V11 ( s, s ) + V12 ( s, s )

the fact that changes in parameter values will have both a direct and an indirect effect on social
capital investment. When it is more likely that a person will choose not to migrate, holding
everyone else’s behavior constant, this increases the returns to investing in social capital.
However, there is also a social multiplier when everyone’s probability of staying in the area
increases. Since the person’s neighbors are also investing more in social capital, this further
increases the returns to investment. This effect is incorporated by the term V12 ( s, s ) , which
captures the interpersonal complementarity between the two types of social capital investment.
The assumption V11 ( s, s ) + V12 ( s, s ) < 0 ensures that the overall impact of permanence will still be
positive.
Given these two investment equations, individuals then decide whether or not to migrate when
their value of ε i1 is revealed. Specifically, there will be a marginal individual, with a value of

ε i1 denoted ε ∗ , who is indifferent between migrating and not migrating. If the expected value of
ε i 2 is εˆ2 , then the value of ε ∗ will satisfy V ( s∗ , s∗ ) − εˆ2 = −ε ∗ , and individuals will leave only if

9

they have a value of ε i1 below V ( s ∗ , s ∗ ) − εˆ2 . If the cumulative distribution of ε is F (.) , then
the ex ante probability of leaving location one is F (εˆ2 − V ( s ∗ , s ∗ )) , which equals 1 − π . The
equilibrium for the model can then be described by the complete investment equation for social
capital β V1 ( s ∗ , s ∗ )(1 − F (εˆ2 − V ( s ∗ , s ∗ ))) = 1 .
We next assume that V (.,.) and F (.) are continuously differentiable. If we also assume that

β (1 − F (εˆ2 ))V1 (0,0) > 1 , so that individuals will never choose to invest nothing in social capital,
and that for high enough values of s, β V1 ( s, s ) < 1 , then there exists at least one point where

βV1 ( s ∗ , s∗ )((1 − F (εˆ2 − V ( s ∗ , s ∗ ))) = 1 . This then implies that there will be an odd number of
equilibria of the model, ensuring that at least one will exist.
As in Spilimbergo and Ubeda (2004), there can be more than one equilibrium of the model. For
example, if there is an equilibrium where

(2) (V1 ( s ∗ , s ∗ ) + V2 ( s ∗ , s ∗ ))

f (εˆ2 − V ( s ∗ , s ∗ ))
+ V12 ( s ∗ , s ∗ ) > −V11 ( s ∗ , s ∗ )
∗
∗
1 − F (εˆ2 − V ( s , s ))

then there will exist multiple equilibria, some of which have higher levels of social capital and
mobility. For another example, suppose we assume the functional form
V ( sij , sˆ j ) = vsijσ ( s + sˆ j )1−σ . In this case, the equation becomes

f (εˆ2 − V ( s ∗ , s ∗ ))
σ (1 − σ ) s

. If F (.) is an exponential distribution, 1 − e − λx , then this

∗
∗
1 − F (εˆ2 − V ( s , s )) ( s ) + σ s s
simplifies to λ >

σ (1 − σ ) s
.
(s ∗ ) 2 + σ s s ∗

To illustrate the possibility of multiple equilibria, consider the following discrete example, where
the value of s can be either zero or one and the utility from social capital is given by α s + β sˆ for
parameters α and β . We specifically chose to assume no complementarity between individual
social capital investment and area social capital investments. We do not do this out of doubt that
10

such complementarities exist (they surely do), but rather because the existence of such
complementarities is well known to create the potential for multiple equilibria. Our goal with
this example is to show that the potential for multiple equilibria exists even without those
complementarities, through a pure migration effect.
We ignore human capital and assume that ε i1 is uniformly distributed on the interval [0, 4], and
that εˆ2 = 2 . If an individual invests in social capital, that person will stay in the city if and only
if α + β sˆ + ε i1 > 2 . The ex ante probability that an investor will stay in their city equals
.5 + (α + β sˆ) / 4 , and the return to social capital investment equals α times that amount. If

α (.5 + α / 4 ) < 1 < α (.5 + (α + β ) / 4 ) , then there will be multiple equilibria. In one equilibrium,
the returns to investment in social capital are low because people expect to migrate. As a result,
people don’t invest in social capital and migration occurs. However, there is a second possible
equilibrium where everyone invests in social capital and mobility is low. People then stay in the
area because the level of social capital is high. This equilibrium is certainly preferable to the
high mobility, low investment equilibrium.
Figure 2 illustrates the model when α is 1.1 and β equals .9. The rising line illustrates the
return to investment in social capital, which increases with the share of the population also
investing in social capital. This increase occurs because as more people invest in social capital,
the probability of staying in the place rises, so the returns to investment also rises. The flat line
represents the cost of investment, which always equals one. The declining line shows the
decreasing share of the population who leave the area. When there is no investment, fifty
percent of the city departs; when everyone invests, everyone stays.
The figure illustrates that there is also a third equilibrium where only a portion of the population
invests and the returns to investment exactly equal the costs. This equilibrium will not be stable,
however, since if a small amount of people change their migration or investment behavior, then
the outcome will converge to one of the other two equilibria.
In general, where there are multiple equilibria, the higher the level of social capital investment,
the better the equilibrium. To see this, note that at the high investment, low mobility equilibrium
an individual is free to privately invest the amount that he would at either of the other equilibria.
11

Those alternative investment strategies would yield lower utility levels then the actual
investment level because the person is optimally investing. Yet at these lower investment levels,
the person will still be getting a higher level of utility than he does in the alternative equilibrium
because the investment of others is higher and each person’s welfare is strictly increasing in the
investment of other persons.
This model yields, for very similar reasons, the basic result of Spilimbergo and Ubeda (2004)
that suggests people may get caught in equilibria that have too much mobility. This model also
echoes the work of Bolton (1992), who argues that investing in places may make sense if
individuals care about community. To see this, we return to our more general model and
consider a place-specific tax that generates revenue from people in area 2 and gives to people in
area 1. We assume that the social planner simply adds up total welfare across areas, multiplies
by β , and subtracts the cost of investment to maximize:
(3)

⎠

The balanced budget constraint requires t1

= −t2 . If there was no change in migration or

social capital investment, then the tax would have no effect, as it would just redistribute from
place 1 to place 2. If there was a migration effect, but no effect on social capital investment, then
a place specific tax would still have no effect on welfare, since on the margin individuals are
indifferent between the two locales. A place-based policy will, however, have an impact on
welfare if s ∗ changes.
Claim # 1: Starting from laissez-faire, a government policy that taxes region 2 and subsidizes
region 1 will increase welfare as long as there are positive spillovers from social capital
investment and migration behavior does not influence human capital investment.
Starting from the point of no intervention, the derivative of total welfare with respect to transfers
will equal β π V2 ( s ∗ , s ∗ )

12

social capital, which yields positive externalities. Social capital could be directly subsidized, but
given the difficulty in measuring social capital it may be that subsidizing space is a reasonably
natural way to achieve that end.
One fairly important assumption is that all migration flows from region 1 to region 2. In a more
complex model where there is migration in both directions, the social welfare enhancing policy
is not to support one or the other region but rather to slow the rate of migration, at least as long
as social capital remains non-transferable. This provides one rationale for subsidizing home
ownership.
This rosy picture of place-based policies omits the many problems that can be associated with
place-based investments, but it does at least leave us with a clear rationale for investing in
particular locations. By increasing the odds that people will stay in a given place, the
government is increasing the degree to which people will invest in location-specific social capital
there. If that investment yields positive externalities, then this will be beneficial.
While this version of the model gives a clear prediction, it will be muted if we change other
assumptions in ways that look quite reasonable. For example, one very natural assumption is
that the returns to human capital might be higher outside of the first location. If the first locale is
a declining city with relatively low returns to knowledge, but the second locale is a growing city
with higher returns to new ideas, then we could certainly imagine human capital would be a
complement with migration.
To reflect this change, we assume that U (.,.) is multiplied by a constant, 1 + φ , in the second
locale, where φ > 0 . This constant is meant to reflect the possibility that the second locale is
innately more economically productive. In this case, the first order condition for human capital
becomes β U1 (h∗ , h∗ )(1 + φ (1 − π ) ) = 1 . The derivative of human capital investment with respect
to mobility is

φU1 (h, h)
∂h∗
=
< 0 . When the probability of staying in
∂π (1 + φ (1 − π ) )(U11 (h, h) + U12 (h, h) )

the first location (with its lower returns to human capital) increases, investment in human capital
falls.

13

In this case, a higher probability of moving decreases the incentive to invest in social capital and
increases the incentive to invest in human capital. Once this tradeoff is introduced, low mobility
equilibria are no longer necessarily Pareto superior to high mobility equilibria since investment
in human capital will be lower in the more immobile situations.
When we again consider government policies to support the first region, there are now two
offsetting effects, so subsidizing the first locale may or may not be efficient. The social gains
from subsidizing the first locale will be positive if and only if
(3) π β V2 ( s ∗ , s ∗ )

∂s ∗
∂h∗
+ (1 + φ )(1 − π )U 2 (h∗ , h∗ )
>0
∂π
∂π

We formalize this in the following claim.
Claim # 2: Starting from laissez-faire, when migration impacts both social and human capital
investment a government policy that taxes region 2 and subsidizes region 1 will increase welfare
if and only if

− V1 ( s, s )V2 ( s, s )
− φU1 (h, h)U 2 (h, h)
.
>
V11 ( s, s ) + V12 ( s, s ) U11 (h, h) + U12 (h, h)

This inequality compares the positive impact that decreased mobility has on social capital
investment with the negative effect that it has on human capital investment. The condition will
always hold when φ is sufficiently low, because in that case mobility has only a tiny impact on
the returns to human capital. The potential to improve social welfare by subsidizing the first
region becomes a comparison between the positive effect of mobility on investment in human
capital and the negative effect of mobility on investment in social capital. Reducing outmigration by subsidizing the first location will be welfare-enhancing only if the gains from
increased social capital outweigh the gains from increased human capital. This will be the main
empirical question that we raise in section III; we first turn to the case where individuals are
heterogeneous.
As an aside, we also note that the tradeoff between social and human capital echoes the work of
Austen-Smith and Fryer (2005) on acting white. In their paper, African-Americans signal their
commitment to their community by investing more in social capital and less in portable human
capital; the choice to value community is seen as being somewhat deleterious because it crowds
14

out more beneficial investments in general skills. We also have a trade-off between human and
social capital, but the implication of this trade-off for policy is not obvious.

Heterogeneous Individuals
There are many different types of heterogeneity that can interact with both mobility and
investment in the two types of capital. Individuals with a low cost of investment in social capital
will be more likely to invest in it and to stay in the first locale. Individuals with a low cost of
investment in human capital will invest in that form of capital and will be more likely to move.
We will specifically focus on heterogeneity in the discount factor, β , which increases the
tendency to invest in both social and human capital. This heterogeneity will impact migration
behavior, but the direction of this impact is ambiguous. The tendency of high human capital
persons to invest more in social capital will make them less likely to migrate, while their
tendency to also invest more in human capital will make migration more likely if φ > 0 . The
overall effect is thus ambiguous.
Let π ( β ) denote the probability of moving as a function of patience. In Sjaastad (1962), moving
was itself an investment, so we would expect more patient people to move more. We could
incorporate that into this model by assuming that individuals pay a moving cost in the first
period, but we choose to keep the model simple. Instead, the impact of patience on mobility
comes only from investment behavior. We also assume that discount factors are orthogonal to
the idiosyncratic returns associated with different places.
Utility maximization requires that first stage investment behavior satisfy the conditions:

β ((1 − π ( β ))(1 + φ )U1 (hi , hˆ2 ) + π ( β )U1 (hi , hˆ1 )) = 1 and βπ ( β )V1 ( si , sˆ1 ) = 1 .
Migration to location 2 is optimal if and only if U (hi , hˆ1 ) + V ( si , sˆ1 ) + ε i1 is greater than
(1 + φ )U (hi , hˆ2 ) + εˆ2 . Higher patience, and higher human capital, will be associated with more

mobility if ((1 + φ )U1 (hi , hˆ2 ) − U1 (hi , hˆ1 )) i > V1 ( si , sˆ1 ) i .

This condition may or may not hold. If (1 + φ )U1 (hi , hˆ2 ) − U1 (hi , hˆ1 ) is small, then the social
capital impact of patience will trump the human capital impact, and more patient people will stay
in the first locale. People with less patience will move to the other area, which means that the
∂s
term (1 + φ )U1 (hi , hˆ2 ) − U1 (hi , hˆ1 ) could even be negative. Alternatively, V1 ( si , sˆ1 ) i could be
∂β
small, so that the human capital effect dominates and more patient people will be more likely to
move to the second locale.
If the distribution of the discount factor is characterized by a density function g (.) , then social
welfare can be written:

include both investment and selection effects. For example, subsidizing the first location always
induces more investment in social capital among people of all types. However, the subsidy may
also induce more patient people to choose the first location, a second benefit of the subsidy.
In the case of social capital, it is always valuable to create incentives for people with more social
capital to stay in the first region. In the case of human capital, it is not obvious whether it is
beneficial to move skilled people from one region to another. This will depend on whether the
externalities vary in size across regions. As Glaeser and Gottlieb (2008) argue that it is
essentially impossible to determine whether human capital spillovers are higher in one place than
another, we will focus primarily on whether decline or out-migration is associated with higher
levels of human or social capital investment.
16

One particularly interesting possibility occurs when out-migration reduces the average human
capital in both the first and second cities. This is akin to the case of the person who moved from
one university to another and reduced the average quality of both. While we don’t know whether
such cases exist, they at least raise the possibility of clear Pareto winning policies that raise the
average human capital everywhere by reducing the emigration of moderately skilled people from
low to high human capital areas. Of course, for these policies to be beneficial we must be sure
that human capital spillovers take the form specified in this paper of depending on the average
skill level, rather than some other aggregation of area skills.

IV. Evidence on Decline, Out-Migration, Social and Human Capital

We now turn to cross-city evidence that is relevant for the model. We begin by looking at basic
facts about out-migration rates and urban decline. We then discuss the evidence suggesting that
rates of return to human capital might be higher in some areas than in others. We next explore
the cross-city differences in human capital investment. Finally, we turn to social capital
investment across space and its relationship to mobility.
The model emphasized the costs of out-migration for social capital investment, but most regional
policies focus on helping declining places. Declining places are not necessarily places with
particularly high levels of out-migration. It is certainly theoretically possible that net migration
rates (which determine decline) are not that closely correlated with the gross migration patterns
that should determine the willingness to invest in place-specific social capital.
In Figure 3, we show the correlation between metropolitan area population change between 1990
and 2000 and the out-migration rate in the area between 1995 and 2000. Population change is
defined as the difference in the logarithm of population between the two census years. The outmigration rate is defined as the share of the population that lived in the area in 1995 and that has
moved somewhere else by 2000. In some cases, we have people who are coded as living in
different regions, but who claim not to have changed houses. We assume that those people did
not actually change region over the time period.

17

The figure shows a strongly significant 54 percent correlation. Places that are gaining population
also have the highest out-migration rate. The right view of urban growth is not that declining
places disproportionately lose people. Growing places lose people even more rapidly. The
difference between growing and declining places is that there are far fewer people coming into
declining areas.
The strong positive relationship between growth and emigration rates suggests that policies that
target declining areas are not targeting the areas with the highest levels of emigration. It also
suggests that declining places are not caught in a bad equilibrium where high expected outmigration rates then create less investment in social capital. If anything, we would expect the
high out-migration rates to reduce social capital investment in high growth areas. Of course, if
we think that out-migration is particularly costly in declining areas, then it may still make sense
to target policies towards those areas that are in decline.
In our next figure, we turn to the overall relationship between decline and different forms of
capital investment. Figure 4 shows the well-known positive correlation between years of
schooling in 1970 and population growth between 1970 and 2000 among metropolitan areas with
more than 250,000 people in 1970. Skilled places have seen increases in population, income,
and housing prices relative to less skilled places over the last 30 years.
Skilled places have also generally become more skilled (Berry and Glaeser, 2005). Figure 5
shows the connection between the share of the population that has a college degree in 1970 and
the growth in that share between 1970 and 2000. As the share in the population with college
degrees in 1970 increases by 10 percentage points, the growth increases by 6 percentage points.
There is not only a connection between human capital and area population growth, but an
increasing tendency of high human capital people to move to high human capital places.
By contrast, the connection between area level social capital and growth is far less clear. We use
the General Social Survey (GSS), which contains survey data for years between 1972 and 2002,
to provide data on social capital. Our primary measure is group membership, which counts the
number of types of groups in which an individual is a member. This measure is quite standard in
the social capital literature (e.g. Glaeser, Sacerdote and Laibson, 2002), but its popularity owes
more to ease of use than any sort of inherent perfection. The measure does not include the
18

intensity of engagement, and fails to account for multiple memberships within a single category
of groups (e.g. hobby groups). However, it is widely available and correlates well with other
measures of social capital.
Figure 6 shows the 4.5 percent correlation between area level group membership and population
growth between 1970 and 2000, among metropolitan areas with more than 200 respondents in
the General Social Survey. There is essentially no correlation between social capital and growth
across metropolitan areas.
Our model emphasized the link between out-migration and social capital, where higher
propensities of leaving a place were associated with less investment in area-specific groups.
Figure 7 shows the correlation between group members and out-migration across metropolitan
areas. In this case, there is a 16 percent correlation. Contrary to the model’s suggestion, places
with more out-migration have slightly more social capital, but the effect is quite weak.
Figure 8 repeats Figure 6 but uses per capita income growth at the metropolitan level as our
measure of success. Per capita income growth will include both the increasing prosperity of
people in an area and the tendency of better paid people to move into the area. Both of these
changes can be seen as a type of success. In this case, there is a -4 percent correlation between
social capital and urban success.
Figures 6 and 8 suggest that social capital is not strongly associated with area growth. Social
capital may indeed create significant positive spillovers, and nothing we have shown contradicts
that view. However, the data does not seem to support the hypothesis that areas get locked into a
bad equilibrium where expected decline creates low levels of social capital investment, which
then in turn make that expected decline a reality. We now turn to individual level data on the
connection between geographic mobility, area decline, and social capital investment.
Social Capital, Geographic Mobility, and Urban Decline
We now turn to the link between mobility and social capital investment. At the individual level,
there is a tight link between length of time in a community and different forms of social capital.
Figure 9 shows the connection between years in a place and membership in organizations.
People who have lived in a place for a long time have, perhaps unsurprisingly, more group
19

memberships than people who are new to a place. Figure 10 shows the connection between
years in a place and voting in the last election. We only have mobility data for a few years in the
1980s, so we have shown results for the 1984 election. Again, we have a significant positive
correlation between years in a community and political engagement. DiPasquale and Glaeser
(1999) show this relationship for a broader range of social capital variables, and estimate that
about one-half of the relationship between homeownership and social capital can be linked to
reduced geographic mobility of home owners.
However, this represents a backward-looking, rather than forward-looking, relationship between
mobility and social capital investment. The model, after all, emphasized that people who expect
to move will also be less likely to invest in social capital. We test this hypothesis by looking at
individual level data from the General Social Survey and regressing social capital outcomes on
area level out-migration rates and the population growth in the metropolitan area between 1970
and 1990. Because urban decline may be different than growth, we allow for a spline in the
urban growth variable so that the slope can be different for the most slowly growing quarter of
metropolitan areas.
We will use a series of social capital variables, including number of organization memberships,
voting in local elections, and self-reported answers to questions about working to solve local
problems. Our basic regression takes the form:
(5) Social Capital = Individual Characteristics + b*Area Growth + c*Out-Migration Rate
Our individual characteristics include age, race, income and, education. The GSS income
variables are somewhat problematic since income is only available in broad categories and some
people refuse to state their income levels. We assign people the mid-point of their reported
income range. We include those who refuse to give their income, and use a dummy variable that
takes on a value of one if the person refused to give their income. We also have a dummy
variable that takes on a value of one if the income variable was top coded.
Our core area characteristics are the out-migration rate, discussed above, and population growth
between 1970 and 1990. We restricted ourselves to this period to slightly reduce the possibility
that social capital is driving growth rather than the reverse. This is a serious concern and we will

20

return to it later. As discussed above, we use a spline so that the slope on area growth can be
different for declining and growing cities.
Table 1 shows our results. The first regression addresses membership in organizations. This
social capital variable increases mildly with income and strongly with education. These results
are all quite standard. Both area level characteristics are statistically insignificant. There is a
weak negative relationship between the out-migration probability and group membership, of no
statistical significance. Population growth is actually weakly negatively associated with group
membership for areas in relative decline. We have run such regressions for a number of different
group memberships and similarly found no significant correlations with out-migration or area
decline. There is little here to support the view that either out-migration or urban decline is
particularly bad for social capital investment.
We next look at two regressions suggesting knowledge of local events. Regression (2) looks at
whether the respondent can name his or her congressional representative. The area level
characteristics are not significantly correlated with this variable. Regression (3) looks at whether
the respondent knows the name of the local school head. In this case, growth is negatively
associated with knowledge for declining areas, but the effect is only marginally significant.
The next three regressions look at involvement in local affairs. Regression (4) looks at whether
the respondent has lobbied a local government official. Regression (5) looks at whether the
individual has started a local group. In both cases, neither out-migration nor growth are
significantly involved with local civic engagement. In regression (6), we turn to a very vague
question about whether the individual has tried to solve local problems. In this case, area level
characteristics do predict engagement. Out-migration positively predicts working to solve local
problems and more growth reduces the probability of working to solve local problems. Both of
these results go in the opposite direction from the theory discussed above.
The final regression examines voting in local elections. Neither out-migration nor growth
predicts voting. Overall, these social capital variables do not appear to be correlated with either
out-migration or growth, at least not in the manner suggested by the model. These results cast
doubt on the idea that reducing out-migration would significantly increase investment in social
capital.
21

One issue with these regressions is that out-migration may itself be a function of social capital
and as such is not a valid explanatory variable. There is no perfect way of handling this problem,
but one method is to look at younger respondents and control for the social capital investment of
older respondents in the sample. We divide the sample by year of birth and include only people
born after 1947 (the median year of birth) in our sample. We then use the older people in the
sample to form an area level average for each social capital variable and we control for that level
of social capital. This regression can then be seen as asking whether social capital went down
among younger people in places that were declining after 1970 or that have particularly high outmigration rates.
Table 2 shows our results. In the first regression, we again show our findings for group
membership. There is a strong positive relationship between group membership in the previous
generation and group membership among the sample in the regressions. This fact can be
interpreted as suggesting spillovers from group membership or a positive complementarity
across people in social capital investment. Alternatively, this correlation may just reflect omitted
local characteristics that raise the returns to social capital investment in some places.
While the previous generation’s group membership is statistically significant, it does not alter the
relationship between area level characteristics and social capital. Neither out-migration nor area
decline has a significant impact on group membership. The other regressions in the table show a
similar pattern. Generally, the previous generation’s investments are positively correlated with
the younger generation’s civic engagement, but controlling for this investment does not alter the
basic lack of a relationship between area out-migration or decline and social capital.
Overall, our results do not support the view that there is strong connection between social capital
and either urban decline or out-migration. Of course, there are many reasons to be skeptical
about these findings. First, reverse causality and omitted city-level variables are real concerns
and our correlations do not imply causal relationships. Second, there is so much imprecision in
many of our estimates that it is hard to rule out negative effects of out-migration and urban
decline on social capital. Nonetheless, without further evidence it would be hard to take the view
that social capital provides a strong basis for place-based policies to support declining cities.

22

Human Capital, Income, and Urban Change
We now turn to the human capital aspects of the model, which suggested costs of subsidizing
declining places. We will do three things here. First, we will look at whether it is indeed true
that the skill premium is higher in cities that are growing. Second, we will look at the emigration
propensities of skilled and unskilled workers. Finally, we will look at the relationship between
human capital accumulation and both out-migration and urban decline.
The model assumed that skilled people would earn more in the second, growing locale. That
assumption was the basis of the prediction that out-migration would increase the returns to
investment in skills. In Table 3, we look at wage results using the 2000 Census. To avoid issues
of labor force participation, we look only at the wages of males between 25 and 55 years of age.
Our basic regression takes the form:
(6) Income=Personal Characteristics+MSA Fixed Effects+b*BA Grad*MSA Characteristics
We control for individual characteristics, including years of schooling, and an MSA fixed effect
that takes out any impact that the metropolitan area has on the level of wages. Our interest lies in
the interaction between different metropolitan area characteristics and being a college graduate.
Do some places pay their college graduates a greater skill premium?
We attempt to answer this question in three different ways. In Table 3, we look at total wages
rather than the logarithm of wages. This is the most natural way to determine whether wages are
higher in some areas. After all, the model assumed a proportional increase in skills in the
growing areas, so this would yield a zero value for “b” if we looked at the logarithm of wages.
Since it is standard to look at the logarithm of wages, in Table 4 we also look at the logarithm of
real wages, defined as the logarithm of income divided by the American Chamber of Commerce
Research Association (ACCRA) metropolitan area price level. Since these price indices don’t
differ by education group, nominal wage results will be essentially the same as real wage results
across areas.
In the first regression of Table 3, we focus on the share of the population with college degrees as
our metropolitan area characteristic. The first regression shows that the income of people with a
college degree goes up by about 5,900 dollars as the share of the population with college degrees
23

increases by 10 percent. This should not be interpreted as a causal link. After all, a place may
be filled with college graduates because it is a good place to be a skilled worker. Nonetheless,
the table does suggest that the returns to skills seem to be higher in some places than in others,
which in turn suggests that the prospect of out-migration may increase the returns to investing in
skill.
The second regression looks at the interaction between the logarithm of area density and having
a college degree. The returns to skill are also higher in denser areas. As density doubles, skilled
workers earn 5,400 dollars more relative to the less well-educated. This effect is quite
statistically significant. One interpretation of this fact is that density and skills are complements;
this is also supported by the propensity of high human capital industries to locate at the center of
urban areas (Glaeser and Kahn, 2001).
The third and fourth regressions look at out-migration rates and urban decline. We address urban
decline with a dummy variable that takes on a value of one if the metropolitan area is in the
bottom quartile of areas by population growth rate. In these cases, there is no significant
interaction with education. These variables may be correlated with the overall wage level in the
area, but the wages of the skilled do not seem to be particularly high or low relative to the less
skilled in places with big population changes. It therefore seems that the ability to emigrate from
declining places increases the potential returns to human capital by creating the option of moving
to denser or more skilled places, not by allowing exit from places in decline.
In Table 4, we repeat these regressions looking at the logarithm of wages. In the first regression,
we estimate a coefficient of .45 on the interaction between the share of the population with
college degrees and the individual’s own college degree. This suggests that as the share of the
population with college degrees increases by 10 percent, the wages of the skilled increase by 4.5
percent relative to the less skilled. In the second regression, we show that there is also a
significant interaction between area density and individual skills. As density doubles, the college
premium appears to rise by about 4.6 percent.
In the third regression, we find a weak negative relationship between urban decline and wages.
Areas in decline have a skill premium that is more than three percent lower than places that are
growing. In this case, the ability to leave declining areas would seem to increase the returns to
24

skill. In the fourth regression, we find no significant relationship between out-migration rates
and the skill premium.
We now turn to out-migration probabilities, which are defined as the share of people who move
metropolitan areas between 1995 and 2000. We have calculated the out-migration rates
separately for people with more than 16 years of education (college graduates), between 12 and
16 years of education (high school graduates) and less than 12 years of education (high school
dropouts). Across the U.S. as a whole, the probability of moving across metropolitan areas rises
substantially with education. Figure 11 graphs the out-migration rates for college graduates
against the out-migration rates for high school dropouts across metropolitan areas. In almost
every area, the out-migration rate is higher for college graduates than for high school dropouts.
In many cases, the difference is enormous.
We now look at whether the propensity of different skill groups to emigrate differs with
metropolitan area growth. Figure 12 graphs the difference between college and high school outmigration rates against population growth in the 1990s. College graduates are much more likely
to exit from declining metropolitan areas, which supports the model. Figure 13 shows that
college graduates are also disproportionately likely to flee low income areas.
These facts suggest that out-migration is a double-edged sword. On one hand, the returns to
schooling are presumably higher for people in declining areas because of the option to migrate.
On the other hand, the exodus of the skilled leaves those declining places with less human
capital. Since human capital is itself such a strong correlate of area growth, this migration may
be hurting the city’s chances for success.
Our final empirical exercise is to look at whether people become more skilled in cities where
out-migration rates are higher. Because out-migration rates and urban decline are themselves a
function of the skill level of an area, we look only at people who were between 25 and 40 years
old in the 2000 Census. We then control for the average skill level of people who were between
40 and 55 in the same year. We hope that by controlling for the skills of older people we are
minimizing the problem of reverse causality, but we still believe that these results are likely to be
somewhat compromised by those concerns. Nonetheless, Table 5 reports our results, controlling
for age and race.
25

The first regression shows a weak positive relationship between out-migration and the share of
the population that have acquired a college degree. Urban growth is, if anything, negatively
associated with getting a college education, once we control for the skills of older people in the
city. In the second regression, we find a strong positive relationship between out-migration and
the share of the population getting a high school degree. Urban growth again predicts less skill
accumulation. This provides some weak support for the view that out-migration and skill
accumulation are positively associated, but it would be a mistake to take this too seriously.

V. Conclusion

In this paper we present a model that can justify government support for declining areas. If
people are less likely to invest in social capital when they know an area is declining, then this
creates a negative externality from decline. Subsidizing the place can work against that
externality, but it also can reduce investment in human capital if the returns to skill are higher
outside of that area. The model suggests that there are situations when it could make sense to try
to keep people committed to declining areas.

The key empirical conditions needed to justify such policies are that out-migration and decline
are strongly associated with lower levels of social capital investment. We investigate this
possibility using the General Social Survey, and find little evidence that decline is accompanied
by lower social capital; across metropolitan areas there is little connection between out-migration
and social capital investment. People who live in declining areas, or places with high outmigration rates, are not less likely to invest in social capital. To us, this suggests that it is unwise
to believe that stemming decline will result in more place-making social capital activities.

We also look at the connection between human capital investment and urban change. We find
that growing areas do indeed offer a higher human capital premium. More skilled people are
also particularly likely to leave declining places. These facts suggest that trying to subsidize
declining places and keep people there may reduce the incentive for individuals to invest in

26

human capital. On balance, it therefore seems unlikely to us that subsidies for declining areas are
likely to enhance social welfare.

Notes: Data is from the General Social Survey (GSS). Respondents were asked (1) how many types of social groups
they belong to (2) to name their U.S. Representative, (3) to name the head of the local school system, (4) whether
they have lobbied a local gov’t official, (5) whether they have helped start a local group, (6) whether they help solve
local problems, and (7) whether they usually vote in local elections. Incomes were taken as the midpoint of intervals,
and those who refused to give their income or had their income top coded were assigned a value of zero (and then
assigned dummy variable values of 1 as appropriate). Out-migration probabilities for 1995-2000 were calculated
using the variable for place of residence in 1995 in the 2000 Census.

Note: Group membership is the average number of types of social groups a person in the MSA
belongs to, calculated from the GSS. Out-migration probability is calculated using the variable
for metro area of residence 5 years ago in the 2000 Census microdata sample, dividing the
number of people who report living in the MSA five years ago but now live somewhere else by
the total number of people who report living in the MSA five years ago.

Note: In this graph, respondents in the GSS are broken down by how long they report having
lived in their current community, and then by the percentage of those eligible to vote that did
vote in the 1984 election is reported. The 1984 election was chosen because the question on
length of residence in the community was only asked in the GSS for some years in the mid
1980s.

HS Dropout's Outmigration Prob.

.2

Note: This figure graphs an area’s out-migration probability for its college graduates vs. its outmigration probability for its high school dropouts. A person’s level of education is determined
from the U.S. Census microdata sample (we classify those who complete less than 12 years of
schooling as high school dropouts), and out-migration probabilities are also calculated using
geographic and migration variables in the Census microdata sample.

Note: This figure plots the difference in outmigration probabilities between those who finish
college and those who finish high school against an area’s population growth in the 1990s.
Population growth is calculated as the change in the logarithm of an area’s population between
2000 and 1990. Both variables are calculated using the Census microdata sample.
