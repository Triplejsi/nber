ABSTRACT
We use 1980, 1990 and 2000 Census data to study the impact of source country characteristics on
the labor supply assimilation profiles of married adult immigrant women and men. Women migrating
from countries where women have high relative labor force participation rates work substantially more
than women coming from countries with lower relative female labor supply rates, and this gap is roughly
constant with time in the United States. These differences are substantial and hold up even when we
control for wage offers and family formation decisions, as well as when we control for the emigration
rate from the United States to the source country. Men's labor supply assimilation profiles are unaffected
by source country female labor supply, a result that suggests that the female findings reflect notions
of gender roles rather than overall work orientation. Findings for another indicator of traditional gender
roles, source country fertility rates, are broadly similar, with substantial and persistent negative effects
of source country fertility on the labor supply of female immigrants except when we control for presence
of children, in which case the negative effects only become evident after ten years in the United States.

I. Introduction

A steady flow of new immigration has resulted in an increase in the foreign born share of
the US population from 4.8 percent in 1970 to 11.1 percent in 2000. Perhaps more dramatically,
the percentage of the foreign born population that came from Europe or North America fell from
70.4 to 18.5 percent between 1970 and 2000, with a corresponding increase in the Asian and
Latin American share from 28.3 percent in 1970 to 52.4 percent in 1980 and 78.2 percent in 2000
(US Bureau of the Census website: http://www.census.gov). Thus, while the shift in source
country composition was especially rapid between 1970 and 1980, further substantial changes
occurred between 1980 and 2000. As we document in more detail below, this change in source
country distribution has resulted in an immigrant population that increasingly comes from poorer
countries with lower levels of education. An additional feature of the immigrant population that
is less frequently noted is that immigrants typically come from countries with a more traditional
division of labor by gender than the United States. Moreover, over the 1980-2000 period, the
gender gap in labor supply in the United States narrowed much more than in immigrant source
countries. If immigrant women’s labor supply behavior mirrors that in their home countries,
rising shares of the US population composed of immigrants from countries with more traditional
gender roles will cause the US female labor force participation rate to be lower than otherwise.
On the other hand, if immigrant women’s labor supply eventually assimilates to US levels, this
effect would be lessened.
While some evidence suggests that source country female participation does influence
immigrant women’s labor supply behavior in the United States (Antecol 2000), little is known
about its effect on the assimilation process. The assimilation profile can shed light on what will
happen in the long run as these women are exposed to labor market conditions and social norms
in the United States. For example, suppose women from a more traditional country have on
average a 20% hours shortfall relative to comparable immigrant women from less traditional
countries. This could reflect a substantial and persistent 20% shortfall throughout their time in
1

the United States, or, say, a 40% shortfall during the early stages of their time in the United
States, which falls to zero with longer residence. The two scenarios have different implications
for convergence of the group to comparable natives and may impact the labor supply behavior of
the second generation of immigrants as well.
In this paper, we study the impact of traditional gender roles in immigrant source
countries on the assimilation of married immigrant women and men into the US labor market.
We focus on married immigrants for whom gender roles are expected to have a greater effect and
in order to consider explicitly the division of labor in the family among immigrants compared to
natives. Family migration models have recently been developed to shed light on this question.
At issue is the shape of the assimilation profile itself. One version of such models predicts that
women will initially take dead-end jobs to finance their husbands’ human capital investments,
and eventually drop out of the labor market or reduce their labor supply as their husbands’ labor
market outcomes improve (Baker and Benjamin 1997). Rather than convergence, this view
predicts a negatively-sloped labor supply profile for immigrant women relative to natives, a
finding that has been observed for Canada (Baker and Benjamin 1997) but not for the United
States; Blau, Kahn, Moriarty and Souza (2003) find US immigrant women’s labor supply profiles
to be upward sloping, much like those of immigrant men. Here we further probe this question to
determine whether the predictions of the family migration model are observed for women
coming from countries with a traditional division of labor by gender. If this is the case, women
from more traditional source countries will fall further behind natives and immigrants from less
traditional source countries as their time in the United States increases.
Even if women from both traditional and nontraditional source countries have upward
sloping profiles, it is unclear a priori which group is likely to assimilate more rapidly. Some
considerations suggest that assimilation profiles of women from less traditional source countries
will be steeper. This steepening may occur via wages if women from countries with higher
participation rates are more career-oriented and hence invest more in labor market skills.
Moreover, even controlling for wages, they may be better able to search for and learn about
2

market opportunities. An additional scenario predicting a more rapid assimilation of labor
supply for such women is one where, upon arrival in the United States, all immigrants experience
major disruptions in their labor market activity, regardless of their source country characteristics.
For example, married immigrant women from both types of source countries may be “tied
movers” (Mincer 1978), reducing their initial labor market activity. However, women arriving
from countries with higher female labor supply may ultimately be planning on higher labor
supply in the United States, thus steepening their assimilation profiles relative to women from
lower female labor supply countries. On the other hand, women from countries with more
traditional gender roles may have higher rates of assimilation in that they may be acculturating to
US norms as well as accumulating information about US labor market opportunities. In this
latter case, any initial differences in labor supply between women from more and less traditional
source countries will diminish over time, whereas in the former case, initial differences will be
magnified.
Studying the impact of source country characteristics on immigrant women’s labor supply
in the United States can also yield insights into the issue of cultural assimilation. Higher female
labor force participation rates in the United States than in many immigrant source countries may
ultimately be due to tastes and beliefs about women’s appropriate roles in society, although they
may also be due to different economic incentives in the United States and the countries of origin.
For example, women in the United States may have higher relative wages than in some source
countries, providing incentives for higher labor force participation and greater investments in
human capital. If differences in labor supply behavior between immigrant women from high and
low participation source countries tend to persist over time in the United States, it suggests that
cultural factors are indeed important. If, however, the labor supply of women from both groups
tends to converge as both assimilate to the US native levels, one might conclude that the hold of
home country beliefs on women’s appropriate roles is relatively weak in the face of US work
incentives and possibly a US market work-oriented culture. (Of course, it is also possible that
immigration from both types of countries is selective of women who planned to assimilate
3

toward native labor supply levels.) Because immigrants are likely to differ from natives in
significant unmeasured ways, comparing labor supply assimilation paths of immigrants from
more and less traditional source countries may shed additional light on the impact of cultural
factors.
To examine the impact of source country characteristics on immigrant women’s
assimilation into the US labor market, we use the 1980-2000 US censuses, which we augment
with an extensive set of source country characteristics data, as described in the Appendix. These
include two indicators of the extent of traditional gender roles in the source country: (i) female
relative to male labor force participation and (ii) women’s completed fertility. . In addition, we
control for other source country characteristics that may affect immigrants’ labor supply behavior
in the United States, including income (GDP per capita in constant US dollars), primary and
secondary school enrollment rates, the fraction of immigrants to the United States from the
country who were refugees, whether the country is English speaking and whether English is an
official language of the country, and the distance from the source country to the United States.
Conceptually important features of our analyses are that we measure these characteristics at the
time each immigrant came to the United States and interact each of them with years since the
immigrant migrated. This is appropriate, since we would like a measure of the tastes or
economic incentives one left behind in deciding to migrate and changes in the strength of their
effect over time in the United States.
Some recent papers have studied the impact of source country characteristics on the labor
supply and fertility of immigrants or their descendants and have informed our study. A study by
Blau (1992), using the 1970 and 1980 Censuses, found a positive effect of source country fertility
rates at the time of immigrants’ arrival in the United States on immigrant women’s fertility
compared to otherwise similar natives, suggesting an impact of gender roles in source countries
on the behavior of immigrant women in the United States. Antecol (2000) provided further
evidence of such a relationship. Using the 1990 Census, she found that source country female
labor force participation rates (measured as of 1990) were positively correlated with US labor
4

force participation, even controlling for human capital characteristics. Also of interest is
Antecol’s finding of a positive, though weaker, correlation between US and source country
participation for “second and higher generation” immigrants, defined by their answer to the
Census question on ancestry. A paper by Fernández and Fogli (2006) also suggests an impact of
source country characteristics on the second generation. Using 1970 Census data on US-born
women with foreign-born parents, they found that source country female labor supply and
fertility each had a positive effect on the corresponding outcome of second generation women in
the United States.
We build on these studies in several ways. Most importantly, we investigate the impact
of source country characteristics on the labor supply assimilation profiles of immigrant women in
addition to their levels of labor supply. Thus, in contrast to earlier work, we will be able to
disentangle the routes through which source country characteristics ultimately affect labor supply
in the United States, i.e., the impact on initial levels and on assimilation paths. Moreover,
contrasting the assimilation profiles of women from more and less traditional source countries is
a useful way to uncover the possible impact of long-term cultural factors, and also allows us to
determine whether the family migration model works better for immigrants from more traditional
source countries. In addition, as in Blau (1992), we measure these characteristics as of the time
each immigrant came to the United States. This is a potentially important innovation,
particularly if indicators such as GDP, fertility or female labor force participation change over
time within countries. Finally, earlier work tended to focus on one or two features of the source
country such as female labor supply (Antecol 2000) or labor supply and fertility (Fernández and
Fogli 2006). As in Blau (1992), we use a broader set of variables to characterize home countries,
increasing the likelihood that our models estimate the true effect of source country female labor
supply and fertility rather than the impact of omitted factors that are correlated with these
variables.

II. Data and Descriptive Patterns
5

Our basic data source is the 1980, 1990 and 2000 US Census of Population public use
micro-samples. In addition, as described in detail in the Appendix, we have assembled a timeseries, cross-sectional database on source country characteristics, which we have merged into the
Census microdata for immigrants based on their country of origin and the date they arrived in the
United States. Because of changes in the list of countries across censuses, we have had in some
cases to aggregate countries and compute appropriately weighted country characteristics. We
also performed some imputations for missing data. (See the Appendix for further details.) Note
that the measure of source country female labor supply we employ is women’s labor force
participation relative to men’s (female LFP/male LFP). This relative measure is appropriate in
that it captures the gender division of labor explicitly. A further advantage is that it implicitly
adjusts for problems in measuring the labor force, particularly at different levels of economic
development, at least to the extent that such problems affect men’s and women’s measured
participation rates similarly.
We focus on individuals aged 18-65 who are married to someone aged 18-65 and restrict
the immigrant sample (respondents and spouses) to those who migrated as adults—age 18 or
over. We follow this procedure because our empirical approach relies on within immigrant
arrival cohort changes to estimate assimilation effects. If child immigrants are included, some
immigrants who recently arrived in the United States as children will be excluded from our
sample of those aged 18-65 in an initial Census but will have attained age 18, and therefore
eligibility for our sample, in subsequent Censuses. Thus, the composition of the sample would
automatically change with time in the United States as those arriving as children comprise a
higher share of those with longer duration of residence (Friedberg 1993). This is likely to bias
the results because those migrating to the United States as children may be less affected by home
country characteristics and more similar to native-born Americans when they reach adulthood
than those migrating as adults. This also implies that adult immigrants, who are the large
majority of immigrants, are the more appropriate samples on which to observe the assimilation
6

process in any case. We use all immigrants for whom we can match source country
characteristics and, for tractability, we take a 4% sample of natives, whom we appropriately
weight in all analyses. 1 Overall, we were able to match over 99% of immigrants who had valid,
non-allocated values for country of birth and year entered the United States to source countries
for which we were able to compute the country variables.
Tables 1 and 2 contain descriptive information on labor market outcomes and personal
characteristics for our sample of married individuals. Means are presented separately for all
(adult) immigrants, recent (adult) immigrants (defined as those who migrated within the last five
years), and natives in each of the three Censuses, for women (Table 1) and men (Table 2).
Overall, immigrant women exhibit more traditional patterns than US-born women. For example,
Table 1 shows that immigrant women have lower labor supply (measured by average annual
work hours, including those with zero hours) and have more children than US women, even
though they are about the same age. Moreover, while immigrant and native women both
increased their labor supply between 1980 and 2000, the native-immigrant gap grew
considerably: in 1980, natives worked 65 hours (8%) more than immigrants; by 2000, the gap
was 319 hours (32%). Recent immigrant women are less comparable because they are 5-7 years
younger than the other two groups. However, it is notable that they work less than immigrant
women overall and their hours gap with natives grew even more steeply; in 1980, recent
immigrant women’s hours were 72% of natives’ but fell to only one half by 2000.
Wage and education gaps between immigrant and native women increased as well.
Among employed wage and salary workers, immigrant and native women earned the same hourly
wages in 1980; but by 2000, natives outearned immigrants by 11%. Similarly, immigrants tend
to have lower educational attainment, with higher concentrations of high school dropouts and
lower concentrations of high school graduates and those with some college. And, while
educational attainment rose for both immigrant and native women, it rose by more for natives.
However, in each year, immigrant women were slightly more likely than natives to be college
1

Borjas (1995) followed a similar procedure.

7

graduates, reflecting a substantial upper tail in the educational distribution of immigrants.
Finally, while natives became slightly less likely to be white, non-Hispanic over the period (the
incidence of white, non-Hispanics fell from 89% to 87%), the likelihood of being white, nonHispanic decreased by much more among immigrants—from 42% in 1980 to 23% in 2000.
Thus, compared to natives, the stock of immigrant women became less skilled and more
dominated by low wage ethnic groups over the period.
In contrast to women, immigrant men worked only 8% fewer hours than native men in
1980, a gap that increased only slightly (to 11%) by 2000. Thus the gender gap in labor supply
fell much more for natives than for immigrants. As in the case of women, immigrant men’s
wages declined relative to those of natives: an 8.0% native advantage in 1980 rose to 18.1% by
2000, a comparable change to that for women. There were also similar changes in relative
education and ethnicity for men as for women.
The finding of a growing immigrant-native labor supply gap among women in the United
States raises the question of whether there are similar trends when female labor supply in
immigrant source countries is compared to that in the United States. To the extent that source
country labor supply patterns mirror the growing native-immigrant gap in labor supply, we may
also ask whether this is associated with a shift in the composition of countries from which
immigrants originate versus differential time trends within sending countries and the United
States. These questions are addressed in Tables 3 and 4, which are based on our sample of 106
countries. (Illustrative values for the 25 top immigrant source countries for activity ratios and
fertility rates are shown in Table A-1.)
Table 3 shows the mean characteristics of source countries for immigrant women, with
source country characteristics measured at the time immigrants migrated to the United States.
(We omit a corresponding table for men, since the source countries of immigrant men and
women tend to be quite similar.) The table also shows the corresponding means for the United
States, similarly weighted by the number of immigrants in each arrival period cell. Panel A
shows means for the stock of all immigrants. The largest weights in this panel will come from
8

countries and time periods for which there were a lot of immigrants to the United States. Panel B
shows means for recent immigrants, thus removing the time of arrival as a weighting factor and
focusing on recent inflows.
Table 3, Panel A indicates that, in each year, the average immigrant woman came from a
country which, at the time of her arrival in the United States, had lower relative female labor
force participation and higher fertility than the United States had at the same time. These
patterns are also true for recent immigrants (Panel B). Thus, throughout this period, immigrants
tended to come from countries with a more traditional division of labor by gender than the
United States. Moreover, although average home country relative female labor supply at the time
of arrival increased over the period, the corresponding US value increased by considerably more,
resulting in a growing gap between US and source country relative female labor force
participation. In 1980, for example, the average ratio of female to male participation rates was
0.45 for immigrant source countries compared to 0.51 for the United States over the same time
period; by 2000 the comparable figures were 0.57 for immigrant source countries and 0.72 for
the United States. A similar pattern held for recent immigrants: in 1980, average relative female
participation was 0.51 for immigrant source countries compared to 0.59 for the United States; by
2000 the comparable figures were 0.60 for immigrant source countries and 0.78 for the United
States.
The average immigrant woman also came from a country with much lower per capita
income than the United States and, whether one measures the income gap by raw (real) dollars or
in relative terms, the difference between US and home country income grew both for immigrants
overall and for recent immigrants between 1980 and 2000. Furthermore, immigrants and recent
immigrants were less likely to have come from English-speaking countries in 2000 than 1980,
although a larger share of immigrants and recent immigrants as of 2000 came from countries
which used English as an official language (but were not English-speaking). On the other hand,
primary and secondary enrollment gaps between the United States and immigrant source
countries have narrowed, and the (small) primary enrollment gap has been entirely eliminated.
9

However, the secondary enrollment gap remains quite large. Thus, most of these indicators
suggest that both the 2000 stock and 2000 flow of immigrant women came from countries likely
to have imparted fewer skills relevant for US labor market participation and success relative to
native women than their 1980 counterparts.
Home country fertility, another potentially important factor affecting cultural and
economic assimilation, behaved differently for the stock vs. the flow of immigrants between
1980 and 2000. On the one hand, home country fertility at time of arrival fell for the stock of
immigrants from 1980-2000, but by less than the corresponding US fertility decline.
Corresponding US fertility was 53% of the immigrant home country level in 2000, compared to
63% in 1980. In contrast, home country fertility for recent immigrants decreased substantially
relative to US fertility and was only 44% above the US level for recent immigrants in 2000,
compared to 2.3 times the US level in 1980. 2 Thus although origin countries have higher fertility
than the United States, the gap is closing at the margin.
Table 4 investigates the degree to which these changes in the source country
characteristics of immigrants are due to changes in the mix of source countries versus withincountry changes over time by showing results for fixed country weights. 3 For the stock of
immigrants (Panel A), had the distribution of origin countries stayed the same, source country
fertility would have decreased by much more while GDP per capita would have risen. However,
the relative female participation rate—the key variable for our study—would have increased by
about the same amount as when source country mix is allowed to vary. A more focused look at
the impact of changing source country composition is shown in Panel B for recent arrivals. For
this group, home country relative female participation would have risen by 10.8-11.3 percentage
points from 1980 to 2000 with constant country weights, in contrast to its actual rise of 8.4
percentage points. Thus, at the margin, source countries are shifting somewhat toward those with
2

Using recent arrival weights, US fertility fell between 1980 and 1990 and then rose back to its 1980 level by 2000.
The English speaking, English official and distance variables are not included in the table since they are of course
constant when fixed country weights are employed. Thus the changes for the English speaking and English official
variables noted above are entirely due to shifting composition.

lower relative female participation. In contrast, the changing country mix for new immigrants
does not seem to have affected fertility at the margin, as the home country fertility rate fell by
1.8-1.9 births, both controlling and not controlling for source country composition. In addition,
at the margin, source countries are shifting toward lower income countries, although, within
these countries, income per capita is rising.
In sum, on average, the annual work hours of both the stock of female immigrants and the
flow are lower than those of native women and declined relative to native women’s over the
1980-2000 period. The native-immigrant hours gap was considerably smaller for men and
increased only slightly over the period. Thus, the gender division of labor became increasingly
more traditional among immigrants compared to natives. At the same time, on average,
immigrant women come from countries with considerably lower relative female labor force
participation than prevailed in the United States at their time of arrival. Moreover, this USsource country gap in relative female participation increased considerably over time, primarily
due to faster female participation increases in the United States than within immigrant source
countries, rather than to a shift in the mix of source countries. Source countries also have
considerably higher fertility rates than the United States, although these differences are declining
among recent arrivals. Low and declining source country GDP per capita (relative to the United
States), a decreasing fraction of source countries that are English speaking and the persistent USsource country gap in secondary school enrollments may also affect the market preparedness of
immigrant women, although the rising share of immigrants coming from countries using English
as an official language and increasing secondary school enrollment rates in source countries are
potentially countervailing factors.
The importance of source country characteristics for immigrant women’s behavior in the
United States is broadly suggested by Figures 1a and 1b, which examine the simple relationship
between immigrant women’s annual hours relative to natives and activity rate ratios and total
fertility rates in their countries of origin. The annual hours of immigrant women relative to
natives are measured by the coefficients on country fixed effects from a first-stage regression
11

estimated on pooled 1980, 1990 and 2000 Census data of annual hours on age, age squared, two
year dummies, and country fixed effects (for all 106 countries in our data). Source country
variables are measured at the time of immigrant arrival and are averaged across Censuses for
each immigrant source country. The trend lines plotted in the figures are estimated across all 106
countries and indicate a positive and significant relationship between immigrants’ annual hours
relative to natives and source country activity rate ratios and a negative and significant
relationship between immigrants’ annual hours relative to natives and source country total
fertility rates. 4 The data points in each figure are included to illustrate the estimated relationship
and (to keep the figure legible) include only the top 25 source countries (countries are ranked by
their weighted share of the sample of married women across all years, with only adult immigrants
included). In what follows we more closely examine the impact of these and other source
country characteristics on the labor supply behavior of immigrant women.

III. Empirical Procedures

Our goal is to estimate the impact of source country characteristics on married immigrant
women’s and men’s labor supply assimilation into the US labor market. We use pooled 1980,
1990 and 2000 Census microdata to examine this issue. In each case, we compare immigrants to
natives with the same observable characteristics. Thus, assimilation here refers to the degree to
which immigrants’ labor supply patterns converge to those of comparable natives. As noted, we
restrict our analyses to married individuals in order to study assimilation in a family context
among the group most likely to reflect the impact of more traditional source country norms.
To analyze labor supply, we estimate equations of the following form on the pooled
sample of married adult immigrants and natives separately for men and women:

4

The trend line shown in each figure is estimated weighting observations by the inverse of the standard errors from
the first-stage regression.

where for individual i in year t (t=1980, 1990 or 2000), H is annual hours worked in the previous
year (usual weekly hours * weeks worked, including those with 0 hours), X is a vector of
controls, Aownc and Aspousec are a series of own and spouse immigrant cohort-of-arrival
dummy variables, Yowns and Yspouses are a series of dummy variables referring to own and
spouse’s years since migration (YSM), Zowno and Zspouseo are a series of country of origin
characteristics for the individual and his/her spouse, T90 and T00 are year dummies referring to
1990 and 2000, and u is an error term. We cluster the standard errors at the respondent’s country
of origin level, treating the US as an origin country for natives. After creating sampling weights
to reflect the random sample of natives and taking into account Census sampling weights for
1990 and 2000, we adjust each year’s weights so that the total weight of each year’s observations
is the same.
We define the cohort of arrival and years since migration variables for immigrants and
their spouses as follows. First, note that the immigrant arrival period is defined in interval form
in the 1980 and 1990 Censuses. Hence, we define sets of cohort of arrival and years since
migration dummy variables that are consistent across the three Censuses. We specify the years
since migration variables as dummies, rather than forming a continuous variable (say by
evaluating the intervals at their midpoints), in order to capture all the available information in the
most flexible form. The cohort of arrival dummies include all but one possible arrival cohort:
1995-2000, 1991-94, 1985-90, 1980-84, 1975-79, 1970-74, 1965-69, and 1960-64 (these are the
Aownc and Aspousec dummies). The full set of years since migration dummies is included: 0-5,
6-10, 11-15, 16-20, and 21-30 years in the US (these are the Yowns and Yspouses dummies).
The sum of these years since arrival dummy variables for the respondent would be identical to an
immigrant dummy variable, and the sum of the spouse years since arrival dummies would be
identical to a spouse immigrant dummy variable; therefore, such indicators are not separately
13

included in equation (1). Using the full set of years since migration dummies requires us to omit
one of the possible cohort dummy variable categories; we have omitted the 1950-59 cohort for
both the respondent and spouse. Pooling the sample across three Census years and assuming
common period effects for immigrants and natives together allow us to separately identify
immigrant cohort and assimilation effects (Borjas 1985).
The interval form of the arrival period in the 1980 and 1990 Censuses affects our
restriction of the sample to adult immigrants and to adult immigrant spouses. 5 For each interval,
we only include immigrants who we can definitely conclude were at least 18 years old on arrival
in the US. 6 For comparability, similar procedures are followed for the 2000 Census data. This
also requires us to exclude individuals in the open-ended arrival category in those years (i.e., pre1950), since we cannot ascertain whether such individuals migrated as children or adults; we also
exclude spouses of such individuals. The resulting maximum years since migration is thus 30 for
1980, and, for comparability, a maximum of 30 years since migration is also set for 1990 and
2000. This explains why the above years since migration dummies exhaust the sample of adult
immigrants.
The origin country characteristics Zowno and Zspouseo are measured for the time the
individual migrated to the United States and are set equal to zero for natives. Thus, they are in
effect interactions between an immigrant dummy variable and the country characteristics.
Because the years since migration dummies (Yowns or Yspouses) add up to one for each
immigrant respondent or immigrant spouse, for each country characteristic, the sum of its
interactions with the years since migration variables equals the country characteristic itself.
Therefore we do not include main country characteristics effects (Zowno or Zspouseo). 7 The

As in the case of own characteristics, we expect spouse home country characteristics to be less salient for those
who migrated as children than for those who migrated as adults.

That is, if the immigrant arrived between A0 and A1, we take only individuals for whom (A0 – BY) ≥ 18, where BY
is birth year as calculated from the individual’s reported age. An alternative would have been to evaluate the arrival
intervals at the midpoint and calculate age of arrival accordingly. We follow former procedure due to its greater
accuracy in excluding child immigrants (see Bleakley and Chin 2004).

Our formulation is mathematically equivalent to including main Zowno and Zspouseo effects but omitting the
interactions between Zowno or Zspouseo and one YSM dummy.

specification in equation (1) allows the source country variables to affect both the level of labor
supply and the impact of time in the United States on labor supply.
Source country variables were selected to serve as indicators of the degree to which the
home country has a traditional division of labor by gender, the extent of labor market
preparedness of men and women, and to address possible issues of selective migration. They
include: the female labor force participation rate/male labor force participation rate; the total
fertility rate (an estimate of completed female fertility); GDP per capita in 2000 US dollars; the
proportion of immigrants arriving in the period who were refugees; the female (female
regression) or male (male regression) enrollment rates in primary school and secondary school; a
dummy variable for whether the country is English speaking; a dummy variable for countries that
are not English speaking but in which English is an official language; 8 and the distance between
the source country and the United States.
Female relative labor supply and fertility rates in the source country are indicators of
traditional gender roles in the country of origin which may, or may not, be replicated in the
United States. Moreover, both home country female relative labor supply and fertility, as well as
income, education, and use of English are all likely to be related to preparedness for work in the
US labor market. In addition, migration likely involves a disruption of work patterns due to
housing and job search in the United States. Refugees and those who came a long distance may
suffer the largest disruption, likely affecting their work assimilation profiles. In addition,
because of the fixed costs of migration, those who come from a greater distance are likely to have
higher labor market returns to migration than those coming from shorter distances, all else equal
(Chiswick 1978). This potential selectivity can also be reflected in work assimilation patterns.
For example, migrants moving from a longer distance may be more likely to have jobs lined up
in the United States (contributing to their higher rate of return to migration), thus raising their
work hours at entry and flattening their assimilation profiles (i.e., the opposite predictions from

8

The English speaking and English official variables are from Bleakley and Chin (2004).

15

the disruption mechanism). Thus, the impact of distance on assimilation profiles is theoretically
ambiguous.
The combination of the cohort dummies and the assimilation effects allows us to
completely characterize immigrant labor supply over time relative to that of natives, starting with
arrival in the United States of each arrival cohort, controlling for the X variables and year effects.
We implement three specifications for the X variables.
First, we control only for a vector R which includes the following variables for
respondent and spouse: age, age squared, three education dummies (high school degree, some
college, and college degree, with less than high school as the omitted category), interactions
between an immigrant dummy and the three education dummies, and three race/Hispanic origin
dummy variables (black non-Hispanic, other non-Hispanic, and Hispanic, with white nonHispanic the omitted category). R also includes eight Census region dummies, and dummy
variables for each of California, Texas, New York, Florida, Illinois and New Jersey, the states
with the largest immigrant populations. Of special note in our controls is the inclusion of
immigrant-education and spouse immigrant-education interaction terms. 9 These variables allow
the impact of education on labor supply to be affected by whether the education was obtained in
the United States and further allow an immigrant (or immigrant spouse’s) level of education to
affect the assimilation process. In addition, because we have included home country enrollment
levels, these interactions in effect transform the immigrant and spouse immigrant education
impacts into effects relative to home country schooling. Implicitly then, these variables control
for self-selection of immigrants by education, as well as for the substantive effect of education.
Immigrants who are higher up in the educational distribution of their country of origin may differ
in their unmeasured characteristics from those with an equal level of education who place lower
in their home country’s educational distribution. To the extent this type of selection is controlled

9

Recall that since the own and spouse cohort YSM dummies add up to an own and a spouse immigrant dummy
respectively, we do not include main effects for immigrant and spouse immigrant.

16

for by our specification, we expect to obtain estimates of the effects of other explanatory
variables that are less biased by selectivity.
Second, to account explicitly for the role of wages and other income in the assimilation
process, we augment R with log of own and spouse wages and family nonwage income, where
these variables are allowed to have separate effects in 1980, 1990 and 2000—that is, we fully
interact log wages and own nonwage income with three year dummy variables referring to the
1980, 1990 and 2000 Censuses. As described in detail in the Appendix, hourly wages are
defined as annual earnings divided by annual work hours for wage and salary workers. We
consider hourly wage observations as invalid if they are less than $1 or greater than $200 per
hour in 2000 dollars using the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index from the National
Income and Product Market Accounts (see http://www.bea.gov). For nonworkers, the selfemployed and those with invalid wage observations or allocated earnings, wages are imputed
using a regression approach. A separate wage regression is run for each combination of year
(1980, 1990 or 2000), gender and weeks worked category (less than 20 or 20 and higher). 10
Nonworkers are assigned predicted wages based on the regression using the under 20 weeks per
year sample. The other categories of workers whose wages are imputed (i.e., the self-employed
and those with invalid wage observations or allocated earnings) are given imputations using the
regression corresponding to the weeks they worked (i.e., less than 20 or 20 and higher). This
imputation is similar in spirit to that proposed by Juhn (1992) and Juhn and Murphy (1997).
Because the denominators of the wage variables and the annual hours dependent variable
are the same, ordinary least squares (OLS) would likely suffer from measurement error bias. We
account for this by constructing instruments for the wage variables. Once we have an actual or
simulated wage for everyone, we construct wage deciles for every person where the deciles are
10

The regressors used were own and spouse variables for age, age squared, 3 education categories, education
interacted with an immigrant dummy, and 3 race/Hispanic categories, plus 8 region categories and dummy variables
for the six states with the largest immigrant populations (California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York and
Texas), as well as the own and spouse years since migration and years since migration*source country variables
specified above. Since the regressions were run separately by Census year, we cannot also include own or spouse
arrival cohort dummy variables.

17

year-gender specific. We compute predicted wages for each person based on wage equations
using all of that year’s exogenous variables plus nine own wage decile dummy variables and nine
spouse wage decile dummy variables. These predicted wages are then interacted with year
dummy variables, yielding six predicted wage variables (own and spouse wages for each of the
three Census years). In principle, these variables should be less contaminated with measurement
error than the actual wage variables (Juhn 1992; Juhn and Murphy 1997; Baker and Benjamin
1997). We then use these predicted wage variables as instruments for actual wages. As
discussed by Wooldridge (2002, pp. 116-117), this strategy is an example of the method of
generated instruments, and the usual instrumental variables results for coefficient consistency and
asymptotic standard errors hold, as long as the wage deciles are not correlated with the error term
of the labor supply function.
Third, we augment the model just described with a vector of variables specifying the
number of children in the following age categories: 0, 1, 2, 3-5, 6-11 and 12-17 years old.
Children are counted if they are present in the household and are the own children of the woman
or her spouse. The purpose of this specification is to account for fertility in the labor supply
assimilation process. Because children of different ages are likely to have different effects on
parents’ labor supply, a detailed specification of the child variables is warranted.
Results from these three specifications can be compared to reach some conclusions about
the routes through which source country characteristics affect labor supply. For example, it is
possible that source country female labor supply positively affects immigrant women’s wage
offers in the United States, and that this indirectly raises their labor supply. Our models will be
able to provide evidence on such mechanisms.
We restrict our sample to married individuals aged 18-65 with spouse aged 18-65, so that
both members of the couple are of working age, and, as mentioned earlier, we include only adult
immigrants.

IV. Results
18

A. Baseline Results for Assimilation

We begin by briefly considering, as a benchmark, the results for the basic specification in
the conventional model excluding source country characteristics (see Table A-2). Of particular
interest are the results for the years since migration dummy variables which show the general
pattern of assimilation. We focus on the results for married adult immigrants, although the
findings for all adult immigrants were very similar. We add the own and spouse years since
migration coefficients in order to assess the assimilation profile for a married couple moving to
the United States at the same time. The results of this simulation show a rising profile of work
hours with time in the United States for both men and women. Further, the rate of increase is
similar for men and women. Among married adult immigrant women, work hours increase by
357 hours for those with 21-30 years in the US compared to recent arrivals, an increase of 38% at
the mean for immigrants; for married adult immigrant men, the increase is 670 hours or 36%.
These differences are highly significant.
The cohort coefficients must be taken into account to make a comparison of immigrants’
labor supply to natives’. This is done in Figure A-1, which shows simulated assimilation profiles
for adult immigrant women married to adult immigrant men who came to the United States at the
same time; the cohort arrival dummies are evaluated at the sample averages. As may be seen in
the figure, married immigrant women are estimated to work 392 hours less than comparable
native women upon arrival in the United States (35.9% of the mean for all women of 1093) and
fairly rapidly assimilate to native levels, working only 56 hours less after 6-10 years and
remaining at approximately the native levels thereafter. Immigrant males’ hours are 410 hours
less than comparable native upon arrival (20.5% of the mean for all men of 1999 hours) and also
rapidly assimilate to native levels by 6-10 years. However, males then surpass natives, working
260 hours more after 21-30 years in the United States (13.0% of the mean). As may be seen in
Figure A-1, results are virtually identical when we estimate equation (1), which includes source
19

country interactions, and evaluate those interactions at the sample means. Results are also the
same when we include only source country main effects (results not shown). Thus, in the
baseline, work hours of men and women increase by similar relative amounts with time in the
United States. In the following sections, we will look explicitly at the role of source country
characteristics in influencing this baseline pattern.

B. Average Effects of Source Country Characteristics on the Labor Supply of
Immigrants

Table 5 shows selected regression results for annual hours for married adult immigrants
relative to comparable natives. In these models, we do not interact country characteristics with
the years since migration dummies, in order to show the average effects of these characteristics
for adult immigrants’ work hours. (Additional regression results are shown in Appendix Tables
A-3 and A-4). We include both own and spouse source country characteristics. The most useful
results are those in the last two columns, where we show the sum of the own and spouse
coefficients and the significance level of the sum. The sum corresponds to an experiment in
which we compare a married couple migrating together from one country to an otherwise similar
couple who migrated together from a different country. Coming from a country with a high level
of relative female labor force participation significantly raises immigrant women’s labor supply
in the United States in each specification. In the basic specification (Model 1), the effect is 549
hours. The effect is somewhat smaller, at 511 hours, when we include controls for own and
spouse log wages and nonwage income (Model 2), suggesting that a portion of the home country
female participation effect on annual hours operates through wages and income, though the bulk
of it (over 90%) is present even controlling for wages and income. However, the effect in Model
3 is 544 hours, roughly the same as in Model 1, implying that the indirect effect of home country
female participation does not operate through children, at least in the specification without
interaction effects.
20

To assess the magnitude of these effects, we note that across the sample of married adult
immigrant women, the 75th percentile of the home country female relative activity rate is 0.636,
while the 25th percentile is 0.368. This calculation uses individual immigrants, not individual
source countries, as the unit of analysis, thereby giving countries sending larger numbers of
immigrants larger weight in computing the percentiles. The 75th percentile figure corresponds
roughly to the Austrian value for the relative female activity rate for 1996, while the 25th
percentile is roughly the level for Pakistan in 1994. 11 Moving from the 25th to the 75th percentile
with respect to home country female labor supply raises married adult immigrants’ work hours in
the United States by 137-147 hours per year, a noticeable effect that is 15-16% of their average
annual work hours of 939.
A further indicator of a traditional home country division of labor is its fertility rate.
Table 5a shows that coming from a higher fertility country significantly lowers married
immigrants’ work hours in the basic specification or when we control for own and spouse wages
and nonlabor income. The 75th percentile for fertility is 5.63 children (roughly Iran’s 1990 level),
while the 25th percentile is 2.49 children (roughly Chile’s 1996 value). Thus, changing home
country fertility by the 75-25 gap (3.14 children) lowers married immigrants’ US labor supply by
108-131 hours, or 12-14% of the mean, in either Model 1 or Model 2. However, when we
control for the woman’s own fertility (as well as wages and nonlabor income), the effect of home
country fertility becomes very small and insignificant. Thus, higher home country fertility leads
to lower US labor supply for married adult immigrants, but this effect operates virtually entirely
through fertility decisions.
An additional important set of results for women concerns home country use of English.
Specifically, migrating from an English-speaking country raises US labor supply by 82-88 hours
per year, or about 9% at the mean, and moving from a country where English is an official
language raises labor supply by 178-214 hours, or 19-23% of the mean. These effects are highly
11

For these and other examples in the text of the countries corresponding to the percentiles, we sometimes refer to
interpolated data.

21

significant in each case. The estimated effect of an English-speaking country is very similar
whether or not we control for own and spouse wages, nonlabor income and fertility; moreover,
while the impact of English as an official language on women’s annual hours declines across
Models 1, 2 and 3, most (over 80%) of this effect holds up even when we control for US wage
offers and fertility.
In terms of other source country characteristics, GDP per capita has significant negative
effects (suggesting an income effect to the extent that measured nonwage income does not
completely capture permanent income); moving from the 25th to the 75th percentile in GDP per
capita lowers immigrant women’s labor supply by 85-127 hours, or 9-14% of the mean. 12
Coming from a country with a higher refugee proportion lowers women’s labor supply, with
significant or marginally significant coefficients. The distribution of refugee percentage is very
skewed, with the 75th percentile at 2% but the 90th percentile at 94.7% refugees. But, even
increasing the refugee proportion from the 10th (0 refugees) to the 90th percentile (0.947, roughly
Cuba’s 1974 level) still lowers hours by only 46-87 hours (5-9% of the mean). Also, while
raising the home country primary school enrollment rate significantly raises women’s work
hours, the effect of a 25th to 75th percentile increase in primary school enrollment only increases
annual work hours by 29-31 (3% of the mean). Finally, on average, coming from a longer
distance from the United States significantly reduces women’s labor supply, lowering their
annual hours by 66-75 (7-8% of mean hours) at the mean of the distance variable, 4137 miles.
Table 5 also shows some significant source country effects for men’s labor supply. For
example, men coming from an English-official country work 149-157 more hours than those
coming from a non-English-official country; these effects are about 8-9% of their average work
hours of 1839. A higher refugee percentage lowers work hours significantly, and moving from
the 10th to the 90th percentile lowers men’s hours by 298-300, or about 16%, per year. This effect
suggests considerable disruption for refugees and below we will provide additional evidence on

The 25th percentile in GDP per capita ($838) corresponds roughly to Afghanistan in 1996, while the 75th
percentile ($5078) roughly to Uruguay’s 1991 level.

22

this issue by studying the impact of refugee proportion on the assimilation profile. Finally, home
country fertility has negative and significant effects on men’s labor supply; the absolute effect is
similar in Models 1 and 2 to those for women but of course is about half as large relative to the
men’s mean work hours as for women. However, in Model 3, home country fertility continues to
have a similar effect for men as in Models 1 and 2, unlike for women. It thus appears that for
men, coming from a country with high fertility is associated with less preparedness for work in
the United States. This interpretation could also characterize the results for women. However,
the small and insignificant effect of home country fertility on women’s labor supply in Model 3
(which controls for children), suggests that, in the case of women, it is indeed larger family size
that lowers the labor supply of women from high fertility source countries. Nonetheless, it is
possible that it is lack of labor market preparedness rather than cultural factors associated with
the source country that causes this larger family size. Thus, the results for men suggest some
caution in our interpretation of the findings for women and illustrate the value of comparing
effects of source country characteristics across men and women. It is interesting that there is no
symmetric negative effect of female/male participation rate on male annual hours (the coefficient
for this variable is insignificantly positive and small in magnitude in the male regressions). This
strengthens our confidence that source country labor supply patterns do indeed have a genderspecific effect on female immigrants that is suggestive of a cultural effect.

C. Source Country Characteristics and Assimilation Profiles for Labor Supply

We now present results for the impact of source country characteristics on men’s and
women’s labor supply assimilation profiles. The basic findings are summarized in Tables 6 and
7. One motivation for studying the impact of source country characteristics on the assimilation
of immigrants’ labor supply is to gain insight into the decisions made by immigrant families. Do
immigrant families migrating from countries with a traditional division of labor by gender
reproduce that division of labor in the United States, or do they (at least eventually) conform to
23

US patterns? If the latter, how quickly does such assimilation occur? Tables 6 and 7 address
such questions by showing the results of estimating equation (1).
Looking first at the results for relative female labor supply in the female regressions,
several important findings emerge. First, and most importantly, in each of the three
specifications, the source country relative activity rate has a positive, significant effect on annual
hours in each YSM category. Thus, as suggested by the results for models including only source
country main effects, source country female labor supply is strongly positively associated with
immigrant women’s labor supply behavior in the United States. We are now able to see that this
effect is roughly stable across YSM categories; the effect of the activity rate ratio on labor supply
at 6-10 through 21-30 years since migration is not significantly different from its effect at arrival
(0-5 years). 13 Thus, the factors mentioned earlier that might potentially cause the gap between
women from high and low activity rate source countries to intensify or decay over time in the
United States appear to roughly cancel out. Finally, as was the case in models including source
country variables without interaction effects, wages and presence of children do not appear to
account for very much of the observed relationship between female activity rate and labor supply
in the basic specification. The coefficients on the interactions are reduced only slightly when
wages are included in Model 2 and then usually increase to roughly their original levels when the
child dummies are additionally added in Model 3.
These effects and the relationship of immigrant women’s labor supply to the native-born
reference group are illustrated in Figure 2 for the basic specification. The figure shows simulated
assimilation profiles for adult immigrant women married to adult immigrant men who came to
the United States from the same country and at the same time, assuming the couple migrates
from a country with (i) a high female relative activity rate, at the 75th percentile of our sample, or
(ii) a low female activity rate, at the 25th percentile. In order to construct the profiles, we assume

13

This conclusion is of course made taking into account both the married woman’s years since migration-female
activity rate interactions and the interactions of her spouse’s variables.

24

the sample averages for the cohort arrival dummies and the source country characteristics apart
from the female relative activity rate.
As may be seen in the figure, there is a substantial and persistent gap between the annual
hours of women from high and low activity rate countries: an unweighted average of 136 hours
across YSM categories, corresponding to 14% of immigrant women’s mean hours of 939. Both
groups of women work less than comparable natives upon arrival; 279 hours less for women
coming from a high female activity rate country and 403 hours less for those migrating from a
low female activity rate country. These are sizable deficits of 26 to 37% relative to the sample
average work hours (including natives) of 1093. Work hours for women from both types of
countries assimilate dramatically over time relative to comparable natives. Women from high
female labor supply countries work roughly the same number of hours as natives after 6-10 years
and work at or above the native levels thereafter. Women in families migrating from low female
labor supply countries continue to work less than natives throughout their residence in the United
States, but by the 21-30 year mark they have reduced their deficit to 126 hours (12%). These
upward sloping assimilation profiles for women from both high and low female labor supply
source countries are inconsistent with the family migration model.
The assimilation results for married adult immigrant women can be compared to those for
married men, as shown in Table 7 and Figure 3 for the basic specification. (The findings for
Models 2 and 3 are virtually identical and are thus not shown.) The activity rate ratio interactions
are not significant and, in the figure, the profiles for men born in high and low female labor
supply countries are virtually identical. Thus, source country female labor supply clearly has
much more important effects on immigrant women’s than immigrant men’s labor supply, as
expected given that men’s labor supply is in general less sensitive to their environment than
women’s (Blau and Kahn 2007). The gender difference in findings is suggestive of an impact of
culture and norms of the source country, though the finding could also reflect the effect of
differences between the two types of countries in the labor market preparation of women.

25

Additional information about gender roles and family migration patterns can be obtained
by examining the impact of source country fertility on labor supply assimilation profiles for
married immigrant women and men (Tables 6 and 7). The results for the basic specification for
men and women show the reduced form or full effects of home country fertility on labor supply
profiles. In this specification, for each YSM category, work hours are negatively related to
source country fertility; these differences are significant for men in each case and for women in
three of the five cases (at 11-15, 16-20 and 21-30 years since migration). Evaluating these
effects at the 25th and 75th percentiles of the source country fertility rates yields an impact of
between 80 and 185 hours for women (9-20% of the immigrant mean) and 101 and 204 hours for
men (5-11% of the immigrant mean). There is no evidence in the basic specification that the
effect of source country fertility differs with time in the United States for men; for women the
effect of fertility is significantly more negative at 11-15 years since migration than at arrival.
Thus, as in the case of the activity rate, we find substantial and persistent differences in the labor
supply behavior of women from high and low fertility source countries, and, as in the fertility
specification excluding source country interactions, we find similar evidence for men as well.
The relationship of immigrant women’s labor supply to the native-born reference group in
the basic specification is illustrated in Figure 4a. Women from both high and low fertility source
countries work less than their native counterparts upon arrival in the United States (the point
estimates of the difference are 294-374 or 27-34% of the mean for all women) and assimilate
towards native labor supply with time in the United States. Women from low fertility source
countries slightly exceed comparable natives by 6-10 years in the United States; their labor
supply remains at or slightly above native levels thereafter. The labor supply of women from
high fertility source countries remains below that of comparable natives, but by 21-30 years since
migration they have narrowed the hours deficit to 112 hours, or 10 % less. The assimilation
profile rises more steeply between arrival and 11-15 years since migration for women from a low
fertility source country (349 hours, or 37% of the mean) than for women from a high fertility
source country (244 hours, or 26%), a difference that is significant. But for no other YSM
26

category is the coefficient on the fertility variable significantly different from its coefficient at 05 years, and, indeed, after 21-30 years since migration, the hours gap for high versus low fertility
origin countries is 117 hours, only marginally more that the arrival gap of 80 hours. For
immigrant men, a 309-440 hour deficit relative to comparable natives upon arrival becomes a
191-318 hour advantage by 21-30 years of residence, as labor supply increases fairly steadily and
by similar amounts over time in the United States for men from both high and low fertility source
countries (Figure 5).
Results in Table 6 enable us to ascertain the role of wages and presence of children in
accounting for the differences in the labor supply behavior of women from high and low fertility
source countries. 14 Results additionally controlling for wage and nonwage income (Model 2) are
fairly similar to those from the basic specification, although the coefficient on the interaction
with 11-15 years is now no longer significantly different from 0-5 years. However, when we
further add controls for children in the full specification (Model 3), patterns look markedly
different, as illustrated in Figure 4b. Hours on arrival are actually higher for women in couples
migrating from high fertility countries, although this difference is not significant, and,
interestingly, labor supply of women from high and low fertility source countries converges after
6-10 years at about the level for comparable natives. This suggests, perhaps not surprisingly, that
the differences between women from these two types of source countries in Models 1 and 2 are
associated with differences in family formation patterns. However, after 6-10 years, the profiles
diverge with women from low fertility source countries hovering at around the native levels,
while the annual hours of women from high fertility source countries progressively decrease
relative to both immigrants from low fertility source countries and comparable natives. While
the hours differences between immigrants from high and low fertility countries for given YSM
categories are not statistically significant for YSM categories less than 21-30, the difference at
21-30 years is large (144 hours) and statistically significant.
14

As was the case for source country female labor supply, the results for men in Table 7 and Figure 5 are virtually
unchanged when we control for wages and nonlabor income (Model 2) or additionally for children (Model 3).

27

The pattern of labor supply with years since migration for women from high fertility
source countries provides some limited evidence in favor of the family migration model in Model
3, which controls for current fertility (as well as wages and nonlabor income). It suggests that,
after assisting with family income and their husbands’ job-related investments, women from high
fertility source countries may take advantage of their families’ growing financial stability to scale
back more in line with traditional patterns. That this pattern should emerge only after controlling
for the presence of children may reflect offsetting effects of source country fertility. On the one
hand, higher source country fertility raises the number of children and thus lowers hours worked
when children are not controlled for. On the other hand, it may be indicative of more traditional
gender roles that make adherence to the family migration model more likely, but this adherence
can only be observed once we control for the presence and ages of children.
Even focusing on the results for Model 3, however, the evidence in support of the family
migration model is mixed. The profile initially slopes upward even for women migrating from
high fertility countries, a finding counter to the strong version of the family migration model,
although perhaps reflecting the impact of initial disruption that lowers labor supply for women
from both high and low fertility source countries. In addition, even though work hours of women
from high fertility source countries decline after 6-10 years of residence, the immigrant-native
hours gap for this group always remains smaller than it was upon arrival in the United States.
Moreover, the family investment model postulates that childbearing would be postponed to
accommodate the need for wives’ financial contributions and that does not seem the case here.
Further, the male profiles are virtually the same whether or not we control for the children
variables (results not shown). Thus, there is no evidence that men’s investment behavior is
affected by home country fertility. Rather, as in the case of the models with source country
interactions excluded, men coming from low fertility source countries work more than those
coming from high fertility source countries, whether or not we control for wages, nonlabor
income and number of children. As mentioned earlier, low home country fertility may also be a
proxy for work orientation in addition to its potential value as an indicator of gender roles. Our
28

findings for males suggest some caution in interpreting the results for women as indicators of
traditional gender roles in the source country.
In addition to the effect of traditional gender roles (i.e. relative female activity rates and
fertility), Tables 6 and 7 show some interesting effects of other source country characteristics on
immigrants’ labor supply assimilation profiles. We focus our discussion on the basic
specification (Model 1). First, coming from a country where English is an official language has
large, statistically significant positive effects on both women’s and men’s labor supply on arrival:
244 hours for women (26% of the immigrant mean) and 370 hours for men (39% of the
immigrant mean). For both men and women, this difference falls dramatically. For men, the
interactions with YSM are no longer significant after 10 years in the United States; for women
the interactions remain significant until the 21-30 years YSM category. The impact of coming
from an English speaking country also shows a pattern of positive effects on men’s and women’s
labor supply that decline with time in the United States, although coefficients are smaller and less
often significant.
Second, for both men and women, coming from a longer distance significantly reduces
work hours at arrival. For example, increasing the distance by 5000 miles (roughly the difference
between Canada’s distance and Japan’s distance to the United States) reduces women’s work
hours at arrival by 145 and men’s by 175. However, for both men and women, the interactions
of distance with YSM category are no longer significant after 0-5 years and are smaller in
absolute value than the effect at arrival. Thus, coming from a long distance appears to produce
an initial disruption for both men and women that is made up after a relatively short time in the
United States. Since distance does not affect long-run work hours for either men or women (or,
from Table 5, the average work hours of immigrant men or women), it does not appear to be an
indicator of positive or negative selection with regard to work behavior. It is also worth noting
that refugee proportion has a negative effect on labor supply that is substantial and significant for
men. The effect for males falls in magnitude from -431 at arrival to -215 after 21-30 years,

29

suggesting the disruptive effects of leaving as a refugee (as argued earlier); however, this
difference (between the effect at arrival and at 21-30 years) is not statistically significant.
Third, the assimilation profiles differ in interesting ways by level of schooling. For both
men and women, the immigrant-native gap in work hours at arrival (i.e. immigrant hours minus
native hours, all else equal) is much more negative for immigrants with at least a high school
degree than it is for high school dropouts, and these differences are large and highly significant.
Moreover, the gap increases in magnitude with level of education and is largest for college
graduates. For each education category, these effects relative to high school dropouts diminish in
magnitude with time in the United States, indicating steeper assimilation profiles relative to
natives for the more highly educated. 15 It is possible that the labor market is more specialized for
those with higher levels of schooling and that it therefore takes a longer period of job search or a
need for additional training for these workers to locate an acceptable job. Since these patterns
hold up even after controlling for wages, these do not appear to be merely labor supply
responses. Additionally, the more specialized labor markets for those with higher levels of
schooling may require additional visas not needed in more menial jobs, again potentially
explaining the lower relative work hours at arrival and steeper slopes for the more highly
educated.

D. Controlling for Selective Return Migration and Other Robustness Checks

The foregoing figures and tables show important effects of source country characteristics
on the time path of immigrants’ labor supply. However, it is well known that the sample of
immigrants is likely to change with time in the United States. On the one hand, if the least
15

Differences relative to 0-5 years since migration are significant in all cases for men and for those with a college
education (some college and graduates) for women. To calibrate the education effects in Tables 6a and 7 relative to
natives, we may, as in Figure 2, evaluate the immigrant-native difference in work hours for high school dropouts for
immigrant women married to immigrant men who came to the US from the same country and at the same time,
assuming the sample averages for the cohort arrival dummies and the source country characteristics. These
differences for women (men) are: 0-5: -146 (-136); 6-10: 57 (137); 11-15: 72 (180); 16-20: 48 (210); 21-30: .3
(297).

successful immigrants return to their native countries, then we may observe a spurious positive
relationship between YSM and labor supply. On the other hand, the most successful immigrants
may have a target income level and return home when they have reached the target, implying a
spurious negative relationship between YSM and labor market success. In addition to the effect
of labor market success on emigration, there may also be country-specific effects on the decision
to emigrate (Jasso and Rosenzweig 1982), which could in principle further confound our attempt
to estimate the effect of source country variables on immigrant assimilation. Furthermore,
subsequent return migration to the United States on the part of some immigrants plausibly raises
similar selection issues and also induces response error on the Census questions designed to
ascertain how long immigrants have been in the United States (Redstone and Massey 2004).
Using longitudinal data on individual immigrants, Lubotsky (2007) finds that earnings profiles
estimated using independent cross sections, such as those presented here for labor supply, are
steeper than those using longitudinal data. This suggests that the positive bias on Census-based
profiles outweighs the negative bias. Such considerations could also affect our estimates of the
impact of source country characteristics if there are systematic differences across source
countries in the propensity for return migration.
We addressed the issue of the possible selection bias due to return migration by using
available data on emigration rates by source country (see the Data Appendix). Specifically, we
included the male and female 1980-1990 emigration rate in our labor supply models, where, for
example, for women we include the female emigration rate to one’s source country and the male
emigration rate to one’s spouse’s source country. In such models, we now compare assimilation
profiles for immigrants coming from different types of source countries but where the return
migration propensity is the same. While the return migration rate can clearly be affected by
actual labor supply behavior, these additional variables in principle allow us to compare
comparably-selected samples of migrants. The basic results for source country labor supply and
fertility were very similar to those reported above. Moreover, the return migration effect (i.e. the
sum of the own and spouse coefficients) was always positive for both men and women and was
31

significant some of the time for women. These point estimates suggest that the least successful
migrants are more likely to emigrate, consistent with Lubotsky’s (2007) results. Thus, our results
are robust with respect to this control for return migration selectivity.
Another issue concerns our focus on married individuals. This raises the possibility that
our results may be affected by self-selection into marriage and, since the incidence of marriage
was declining over this period, changes in this selectivity over time (Blau and Kahn 2007). In
this respect it is reassuring that our basic conclusions about the impact of home country
characteristics on women’s labor supply assimilation profiles were similar when we used the
sample of all immigrants (see results for the basic specification in Table A-5). 16 Using this larger
sample addresses concerns about possible selection bias when we confine the analysis to married
individuals.
In another robustness check, for comparison purposes, we examined results using current
(rather than arrival) home country characteristics in some of our analyses. Our conclusions were
very similar under either specification, suggesting that the relative values of the source country
characteristics are fairly constant over time. Finally, results were also broadly similar when we
performed separate pairwise analyses for 1980-90 and 1990-2000, rather than pooling all three
years as we do in our main specifications.

V. Conclusions

In this paper, we began by describing the changing labor supply of the married immigrant
population in comparison to natives over the 1980-2000 period. We found that a modest female
immigrant shortfall in work hours (vs. natives) in 1980 grew substantially over the next twenty
years. In contrast, among men, the small immigrant work hours deficit grew only slightly. Thus,
16

There are some small differences worth mentioning. The coefficients on the source country fertility interactions
in the sample of all immigrants are generally negative but smaller in magnitude than for the married sample, and
never significant. In addition, the coefficients on the English speaking variable while positive for both groups are
smaller and less often significant for married individuals.

32

while both immigrant and native women’s labor supply both increased absolutely and relative to
men’s, the gender difference in work hours fell much more for natives than for immigrants.
We then described changes in the characteristics of immigrant source countries at the
time of immigrants’ arrival in the United States for the stock of immigrants present in the United
States over the 1980-2000 period. On average, immigrant women came from countries with
considerably lower relative female labor force participation than prevailed in the United States at
the same time, and there was a sizable increase in the US-source country gap in relative female
participation over the period. This was principally related to larger female participation increases
in the United States than within immigrant source countries, rather than to a shift in the mix of
source countries. Home country fertility rates were also substantially higher than in the United
States and fell at a slower relative rate for the stock of immigrants, although they declined more
sharply for recent arrivals. Immigrants also came from countries with considerably lower GDP
per capita and secondary school enrollment, and shifts in the mix of source countries contributed
to these differences. In addition, source countries were more likely to be English speaking in
1980 than in 2000, although immigrants in 2000 were more likely to come from countries that,
while not English-speaking, used English as an official language, and secondary school
enrollment rates rose in source countries relative to the United States. On most indicators,
however, the US immigrant population is increasingly from countries where women are either
less well prepared for, or have weaker preferences for, market work.
We then turned to a detailed examination of the assimilation of married immigrant
women into the US labor market. We found that, controlling for personal characteristics, women
from high female labor supply countries work more than those from low female labor supply
source countries and that this gap is substantial and roughly constant with length of residence in
the United States. The work hours of women from both types of source countries do however
assimilate dramatically over time relative to comparable natives. Women from high female labor
supply countries (at the 75th percentile of the distribution) work roughly the same number of
hours as natives after 6-10 years and work at or above the native levels thereafter. Women
33

migrating from low female labor supply countries (at the 25th percentile of the distribution) have
reduced their deficit to 126 hours (12%) by the 21-30 year mark. These findings suggest that
growing up in a country with less traditional gender roles facilitates the labor market assimilation
of women, perhaps by giving them higher (unmeasured) human capital levels or a stronger work
orientation. Men’s labor supply levels and profile slopes are unaffected by source country female
labor supply, results that suggest that the female findings reflect notions of gender roles rather
than overall work orientation.
Findings for another indicator of traditional gender roles, source country fertility rates, are
broadly similar, with substantial and persistent negative effects of source country fertility on the
labor supply of female immigrants, except when we control for presence of children. When we
do control for children, we obtain some partial support for the family migration model: labor
supply of women from high and low fertility source countries converges after 6-10 years at about
the level for comparable natives, but then diverges, with work hours of women from low fertility
source countries hovering at around the native levels, while work hours of women from high
fertility source countries progressively decrease relative to both immigrants from low fertility
source countries and comparable natives. Despite this, women from high fertility countries
continue to work more than they did on arrival, in contrast to a strong version of the family
migration model which predicts maximum female work hours upon arrival in the United States.
The nature of gender roles in source countries for immigrants to the United States is
changing in potentially offsetting ways. On the one hand, fertility rates are falling dramatically
elsewhere relative to the United States, potentially raising immigrant women’s labor supply here.
On the other hand, while female labor force participation relative to men’s grew around the
world between 1980 and 2000, it grew even faster in the United States. These trends could
potentially widen the relative gap in labor supply between native and immigrant women.
However, more recently female participation rates in the United States have leveled off,
suggestion that source country rates may begin to catch up to the US rate. Thus, the future

34

assimilation of immigrant women into the US labor market will depend on the strength of these
opposing forces.

Data Appendix
Individual Variables
Data were obtained from the 1980, 1990 and 2000 five percent extracts of the US Census.
Those people born in the United States or a US territory or possession, or born abroad to an
American parent are classified as natives; others are classified as immigrants. All immigrants in
the extracts are included, along with all natives who were married to immigrants. A 4% random
sample was taken of the remaining observations, with the 1990 and 2000 Census person weights
multiplied by 25; comparable weights were created for the 1980 Census for which no Census
weights are provided. (Hence, we have a 1/500 sample of natives.) To ensure that each year was
given equal weight, the adjusted weights were then divided by the sum of these weights over all
observations in a given year.
For the married sample, husband and wife records were matched, with observations
dropped if either spouse was not in the 18-65 age range, had zero weight, had allocated annual
weeks worked, allocated hours worked per week, allocated birthplace or year of immigration, or
had missing source country information. For the total sample, observations were dropped if a
person was not in the 18-65 age range; had zero weight; had allocated annual weeks worked,
allocated hours worked per week, allocated birthplace or year of immigration, or had missing
source country information.
Since we focus on adult immigrants, the preceding samples were further restricted by
excluding immigrants who arrived in the United States before age 18. Data on arrival period in
the 1980 and 1990 Censuses is in interval form. For each interval, we only include immigrants
for whom we can definitely conclude that they were at least 18 years old on arrival in the United
States. That is, if the immigrant arrived between A0 and A1, we take only individuals for whom
(A0 – BY) ≥ 18, where BY is birth year as calculated from the individual’s reported age. For
comparability, similar procedures were followed for the 2000 Census data. This also required us
to exclude individuals in the open-ended arrival category for 1980 and 1990 (i.e., pre-1950),
since we cannot ascertain whether such individuals migrated as children or adults. The resulting
maximum years since migration is thus 30 for 1980, and, for comparability, a maximum of 30
years since migration is also set for 1990 and 2000. We define sets of cohort of arrival and years
since migration variables dummies that are consistent across the three Censuses. The cohort of
arrival dummies include all but one possible arrival cohort: 1995-2000, 1991-94, 1985-90, 198084, 1975-79, 1970-74, 1965-69, and 1960-64 (1950-59 is the omitted category). The full set of
years since migration dummies is included: 0-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20, and 21-30 years in the US.
Values for the highest grade completed by husbands and wives in the 1990 and 2000
samples were assigned using Jaeger’s (1997) suggested correspondence. Annual hours worked
were defined as the product of the number of weeks worked (WKSWORK) in the previous year
and the number of hours usually worked (UHRSWK) during those weeks; a respondent was
considered to be in the workforce if UHRSWK>0.

36

All nominal earnings and income variables were converted into 2000 dollars using the
National Income and Product Account price index for personal consumption expenditures. All
top-coded values of total wage and salary earnings (INCWAGE) in each year were multiplied by
1.45. (Our correction factor was midway between the 1.4 value used by Card and DiNardo
(2002) and Autor, Katz and Kearney’s (2004) value of 1.5.) The Census top-coded value for
INCWAGE was $75,000 in 1980, $140,000 in 1990 and $175,000 in 2000. lnw was equal to the
log of the modified value of INCWAGE divided by the product of WKSWORK and HRSWK.
All top- and bottom-coded values of the interest, divided and rental income variable
(INCINVST) in each year were also multiplied by 1.45.
Flags were generated for any observation that had an allocated value for any variable used
in creating lnw, non-zero self-employment income or an allocated value for self-employment
income or a wage value less than $1 or greater than $200 (in 2000 dollars). An imputed wage
variable was created, using actual wages unless the individual was not employed or the
calculated wage value was not valid, in which case predicted values were used from separate log
wage regressions for each combination of gender, Census year, and low/high work weeks (using
a 20 week cut-off). The low work week regression was used for those who did not work, while
actual weeks determined the weeks cutoff for those whose wage was not valid. The regressors
used were age, age squared, 3 education categories and 3 race/Hispanic categories, 8 region
categories and dummy variables for the six states with the largest immigrant populations
(California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York and Texas), as well as the years since
migration, and years since migration*source country variables specified in the text. Spouse
values for these variables were also included as regressors in those specifications where we
consider married men and women only.
Source Country Variables
The source country characteristics described below were collected at five-year intervals
for the period 1950 to 2000. To form a consistent list of source countries, we combine some
countries which were not available in some Census years (e.g. subsets of countries in Africa, the
Pacific Islands, and the West Indies) and countries that split or combined between 1980 and 2000
(e.g. the former USSR countries, East and West Germany, former Czechoslovakia, and former
Yugoslavia). Some countries were combined because data on source country characteristics were
only available in a combined form. The data set includes 106 source countries in total. The
characteristics for each composite group are the average values over constituent countries
weighted by each country’s population age 18 to 65 from the 2000 Census 1% extract. Due to
missing values of source country variables in some years, we have, in cases, interpolated for
intervening years, used earliest (most recent) values for preceding (subsequent) years, and
imputed source country characteristics from neighboring countries. Source country
characteristics were matched to arrival cohorts as follows: 1950-1959: 1955; 1960-1964: 1960;
1965-1969: 1965; 1970-1974: 1970; 1975-1979: 1975; 1980-1984: 1980; 1985-1990: 1985;
1991-1994: 1990; 1995-2000: 1995.

The trend line has a slope of -29.22 with a standard error of 14.60.

Notes: The annual hours of immigrant women in the US relative to natives are measured by the coefficients on
country fixed effects from a first-stage regression estimated on pooled 1980, 1990 and 2000 Census data of
2
annual hours on age, age , two year dummies, and country fixed effects (for all 106 countries). The trend line
shown in each figure is estimated weighting observations by the inverse of the standard errors from the firststage regression. Source country variables are measured at the time of immigrant arrival and are averaged
across Censuses for each immigrant source country. The data points in each figure illustrate the estimated
relationship for the top 25 source countries (countries are ranked by their weighted share of the sample of
married women across all years, with only adult immigrants included).

Immigrants include only adult immigrants.

Note: Source country and US characteristics are measured as of each immigrant's arrival period and averaged across
immigrants. For source countries, this yields means weighted by the number of immigrants in each source country-arrival
period cell. For US characteristics, this yields means weighted by the number of immigrants in each arrival period cell.
Census sampling weights are taken into account. Immigrant samples include only those from countries with observations
in each Census year.

Immigrants include only adult immigrants.

Note: Source country characteristics are measured as of each immigrant's arrival date and averaged across immigrants. Country weights are fixed
by giving each immigrant a weight for her source country corresponding to the indicated year's frequency of immigrants from that source country.
Census sampling weights are taken into account. Immigrant samples include only those from countries with observations in each Census year.
