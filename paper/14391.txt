Stabilizing Expectations under Monetary and Fiscal Policy Coordination
Stefano Eusepi and Bruce Preston
NBER Working Paper No. 14391
October 2008
JEL No. E52,E62
ABSTRACT
This paper analyzes the constraints imposed on monetary and fiscal policy design by expectations
formation. Households and firms learn about the policy regime using historical data. Regime uncertainty
substantially narrows, relative to a rational expectations analysis of the model, the menu of policies
consistent with expectations stabilization. There is greater need for policy coordination: the specific
choice of monetary policy limits the set of fiscal policies consistent with macroeconomic stability
--- and simple Taylor-type rules frequently lead to expectations-driven instability. In contrast, non-Ricardian
fiscal policies combined with an interest rate peg promote stability. Resolving uncertainty about the
prevailing monetary policy regime improves stabilization policy, enlarging the menu of policy options
consistent with stability. However, there are limits to the benefits of communicating the monetary
policy regime: the more heavily indebted the economy, the greater is the likelihood of expectations-driven
instability. More generally, regardless of agents' knowledge of the policy regime, even when expectations
are anchored in the long term, short-term dynamics display greater volatility than under rational expectations.

Introduction

Following Taylor (1993) a large literature has developed arguing that a simple linear relationship between nominal interest rates, in‡ation and some measure of real activity, can account
for the behavior of the Federal Reserve and central banks in a number of developed countries.
Subsequent theoretical and applied work on monetary policy has introduced such rules as
behavioral equations for policymakers in general equilibrium models. Simple rules have the
desirable property of stabilizing expectations when policy is su¢ ciently active in response to
developments in the macroeconomy. This property is often referred to as the Taylor principle.
It assumes that …scal policy is Ricardian or ‘passive’, implying that in‡ation and real activity
are independent of …scal variables, and that agents have complete knowledge of the economic
environment; in particular, the monetary and …scal regime.1
The appropriateness of this view rests on policy being of a particular kind and on the
absence of regime change. Yet there are clearly historical episodes indicating on-going shifts
in the con…guration of monetary and …scal policy in the U.S. post-war era. They suggest
that policy might better be described by evolving combinations of active and passive policy
rules, for which monetary policy may or may not satisfy the Taylor principle, and …scal policy
may or may not be Ricardian.2 It is then reasonable to assume that in the initial phase of
a policy regime market participants lack full information about policy or its e¤ects on the
macroeconomy. This paper evaluates the consequences of imperfect information about the
prevailing policy regime, speci…ed by simple rules, for the e¢ cacy of stabilization policy.
We consider a model of near-rational expectations where market participants and policymakers have incomplete knowledge about the structure of the economy. Private agents are
optimizing, have a completely speci…ed belief system, but do not know the equilibrium mapping between observed variables and market clearing prices. By extrapolating from historical
patterns in observed data they approximate this mapping to forecast exogenous variables
relevant to their decision problems, such as prices and policy variables. Unless the monetary
1

The term ‘passive’ follows the language of Leeper (1991). The descriptor ‘Ricardian’ follows Woodford
(1996): for all sequences of prices, the …scal accounts of the government are intertemporally solvent.

The bond price support regime in the U.S. in the late 1940s discussed by Woodford (2001), and recent
empirical evidence of shifting policy rules by Davig and Leeper (2006), are two examples.

and …scal authority credibly announces the policy regime in place, agents are assumed to lack
knowledge of the policy rules. Because agents must learn from historical data, beliefs need
not be consistent with the objective probabilities implied by the economic model. Hence,
expectations need not be consistent with implemented policy — in contrast to a rational
expectations analysis of the model.3
A policy regime is characterized by a monetary policy rule that speci…es nominal interest
rates as a function of expected in‡ation and a tax rule that describes how the structural
surplus is adjusted in response to outstanding public debt. The central bank has imperfect
knowledge about the current state: it has to forecast the current in‡ation rate to implement
policy. The central bank therefore reacts with a delay to changing economic conditions:
argued to be characteristic of actual policy-making — see McCallum (1999). Stabilization
policy is harder because it is more di¢ cult to predict business cycle ‡uctuations.
Policy regime changes are not explicitly modelled. Instead, a stationary model environment is studied: policy rules are constant for all time. In contrast with rational expectations,
we assume that initial expectations are not consistent with the policy regime in place. The
environment constitutes a best-case scenario. If agents are unable to learn the policy reaction
functions describing monetary and …scal policy in a stationary environment, then learning
such objects when there are changes in policy regime can only occur under more stringent
conditions.
The analysis commences by identifying a class of policies that ensures determinacy of
rational expectations equilibrium in our model. Within this class, policy rules are considered
desirable if they have the additional property of stabilizing expectations under imperfect
information, in the sense that expectations converge to the rational expectations equilibrium
associated with a given policy regime. This is adjudged by the property of expectational
stability developed by Marcet and Sargent (1989) and Evans and Honkapohja (2001). Hence,
good policy should be robust to both central bank and private agents’imperfect knowledge.
3

A further implication of imperfect knowledge is agents respond with a delay to changes in policy. Indeed,
given a change in policy regime, agents have few initial data points to infer the nature of the new regime and
its implications for equilibrium outcomes. This accords with Friedman (1968), which emphasizes the existence
of lags in monetary policy.

2

This robustness property is assessed in two scenarios: one where agents have no knowledge
of the monetary policy regime and one in which it is known. The latter implies all details
of the central bank’s monetary policy rule are correctly understood so that agents make
policy consistent forecasts. Within each scenario two regimes are considered: one with active
monetary and passive …scal policy and one with passive monetary and active …scal policy.
The central …nding of the paper is that simple rules of the kind proposed by the recent
literature on monetary policy design generally fail to stabilize expectations if imperfect information about the policy regime is explicitly modeled. Four speci…c results are of note. First,
under regime uncertainty, stabilization policy is demonstrated to be more di¢ cult than in
a rational expectations analysis of the model: the menu of policies consistent with expectations stabilization is narrowed considerably. For a large class of active monetary policies that
satisfy the Taylor principle, there is no choice of …scal policy consistent with expectations
stabilization. Instability arises due to a failure of traditional aggregate demand management.
As real interest rates are not accurately projected, anticipated future changes in monetary
policy are less e¤ective in managing current aggregate demand.
Second, for passive monetary policies that do not satisfy the Taylor principle, there is
always a choice of …scal policy consistent with macroeconomic stability — though admissible
choices depend on the precise choice of monetary policy, underscoring the need for coordination in policy design. Stability arises when uncertainty about real interest rates is small
(monetary policy is su¢ ciently passive) and countervailing stabilizing wealth e¤ects are strong
enough (…scal policy is su¢ ciently active). These wealth e¤ects arise under this con…guration
of policy because beliefs tie the evolution of in‡ation and real activity to outstanding public debt.4 Shifts in the valuation of the latter are conducive to stability: incipient in‡ation
pressure from excess demand reduces the value of public debt, which restrains demand and,
therefore, in‡ation.
A corollary to these two results is period-by-period stabilization policy can be harmful.
Interest rate rules that respond to estimates of current in‡ation and tax rules that respond to
outstanding debt can lead to instability. Indeed, the stronger the dependence of policy vari4

This is the …scal theory of the price level. In‡ation and output are no longer independent of …scal variables.

ables on endogenous macroeconomic developments, the greater the likelihood of expectationsdriven instability. This gives support to concerns about the ability of policy-makers to …ne
tune the macroeconomy expounded in Friedman (1968). However, a policy regime which
guarantees stability of expectations comprises rules for the interest rate and structural surplus that are purely exogenous. A special class of such policies is the bond price support
regime discussed by Woodford (2001).
Third, resolving uncertainty about the monetary policy regime improves the stabilization
properties of simple rules. Independently of the policy regime in place, the improvement in
macroeconomic stability stems from e¤ective demand management, as the evolution of nominal interest rates becomes more predictable. However, if monetary policy is understood but
market participants face uncertainty about the …scal regime, the set of desirable stabilization
policies depends on the economy’s debt-to-output ratio. The more heavily indebted an economy, the smaller the menu of policies consistent with stability. That a steady state property
of …scal policy mitigates the e¢ cacy of stabilization policy stems from a second kind of wealth
e¤ect in our model. Because households incorrectly forecast future tax changes, variations
in current taxes lead to wealth e¤ects on consumption demand: there are departures from
Ricardian equivalence — compare Barro (1974). These wealth e¤ects have magnitude proportional to the average debt-to-output ratio of the economy; are destabilizing; and engender
much more persistent dynamics in response to disturbances. These …ndings resonate with
practical policy-making, which frequently cites concern about the size of the public debt for
stabilization policy.
Fourth, simple policy rules can be a source of macroeconomic instability even when expectations are anchored in the long term. In a calibrated example, we analyze the dynamic
response of the economy to a small shock to in‡ation expectations (equivalent to a change in
the perceived in‡ation target) under alternative assumptions about knowledge of the monetary policy regime and alternative levels of steady state government debt. Under regime
uncertainty, a shock to in‡ation expectations leads to persistent undesired ‡uctuations in
in‡ation and output before convergence to their equilibrium values. This suggests study of
more sophisticated policy rules, such as targeting rules proposed by Giannoni and Woodford

4

(2002), Svensson (1999) and Svensson and Woodford (2005), is warranted.
Related Literature: The analysis owes much to Leeper (1991) and the subsequent
literature on the …scal theory of the price level — see, in particular, Sims (1994), Woodford
(1996) and Cochrane (1998). It also contributes to a growing literature on policy design under
learning dynamics — see, inter alia, Howitt (1992), Bullard and Mitra (2002, 2006), Eusepi
(2007), Evans and Honkapohja (2003, 2005, 2006), Preston (2005, 2006, 2008) — but is most
directly related to Evans and Honkapohja (2007) and Eusepi and Preston (2007a). The former
paper considers the interaction of monetary and …scal policy in the context of Leeper’s model
under learning dynamics rather than rational expectations. The analysis here advances their
…ndings by considering a model in which agents are optimizing conditional on their beliefs.
The latter paper analyzes the role of communication in stabilizing expectations. The
presence or absence of knowledge about the policy regime is adapted from the notions of
full communication and no communication developed in that paper. The results here di¤er
in non-trivial ways as a broader class of …scal policy is considered. Rather than assuming
a zero-debt Ricardian …scal policy, which is understood by households, the analysis here
considers a class of locally Ricardian and non-Ricardian …scal policies determined by the
dual speci…cation of a tax rule, which is unknown to agents, and choice of debt-to-output
ratio. This engenders signi…cantly richer model predictions regarding policy interactions and
expectations stabilization, because agents must forecast future taxes to make current spending
decisions and because holdings of the public debt are treated as net wealth.
Our analysis also connects to various papers questioning the desirability of the Taylor
principle as a foundation of monetary policy design. In particular, Benhabib, Schmitt-Grohe,
and Uribe (2001) show that incorporating money in household and …rm decisions leads to
indeterminacy in the Ricardian regime even if the Taylor principle is satis…ed. Building on
Edge and Rudd (2002), Leith and von Thadden (2006) show in a Leeper (1991) style model
with capital that conditions for determinacy of rational expectations equilibrium depend on
the debt-to-output ratio as in results presented here. Gali, Lopez-Salido, and Valles (2004)
and Bilbiie (2008) develop models of limited asset market participation, and adduce evidence
that the Taylor principle may be neither su¢ cient nor necessary for determinacy of rational

5

expectations equilibrium. Our paper builds on this literature by showing that uncertainty
about the mapping from primitive disturbances to equilibrium prices can similarly compromise
the e¤ectiveness of standard policy advice — despite being a minimal departure from the
standard New Keynesian framework. Finally, Branch, Davig, and McGough (2008) analyze
stability under learning in a model with recurrent regimes, modelled as Markov processes.
Here the issue of imperfect knowledge about policy regimes is addressed in a microfounded
model where regimes are non-recurrent.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 lays out model microfoundations under an arbitrary assumption on expectations formation. Section 3 speci…es the adopted belief structure.
Section 4 revisits the analysis of Leeper (1991). Section 5 gives the core results under regime
uncertainty. Section 6 discusses improving stabilization policy by resolving uncertainty about
monetary policy. Section 7 concludes.

A Simple Model

The following section details a model similar in spirit to Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (1999)
and Woodford (2003). A continuum of households faces a canonical consumption allocation
problem and decides how much to consume of available di¤erentiated goods and how much
labor to supply to …rms for the production of such goods. A continuum of monopolistically
competitive …rms produces di¤erentiated goods using labor as the only input and faces a
price-setting problem of the kind proposed by Calvo (1983) and implemented by Yun (1996).
The major di¤erence is the incorporation of near-rational beliefs delivering an anticipated
utility model as described by Kreps (1998) and Sargent (1999). The analysis follows Marcet
and Sargent (1989a) and Preston (2005), solving for optimal decisions conditional on current
beliefs.

the economy’s available goods and has associated price index written, respectively, as

E^ti denotes the beliefs at time t held by each household i; which satisfy standard probability
laws. Section 3 describes the precise form of these beliefs and the information set available to
agents in forming expectations. Households and …rms observe only their own objectives, constraints and realizations of aggregate variables that are exogenous to their decision problems
and beyond their control. They have no knowledge of the beliefs, constraints and objectives
of other agents in the economy: in consequence agents are heterogeneous in their information
sets in the sense that even though their decision problems are identical, they do not know
this to be true.
Asset markets are assumed to be incomplete. The only asset in non-zero net supply is
government debt to be discussed below. The household’s ‡ow budget constraint is

In general, No Ponzi does not ensure satisfaction of the intertemporal budget constraint under incomplete

the steady state structural surplus-to-income ratio.7 Optimal consumption decisions depend
on current wealth and on the expected future path of after-tax income and the real interest
rate.8 The optimal allocation rule is analogous to permanent income theory, with di¤erences
emerging from allowing variations in the real rate of interest, which can occur due to variations in either the nominal interest rate or in‡ation. Note also, that as households become
more patient, current consumption demand is more sensitive to expectations about future
macroeconomic conditions.
The steady state structural surplus-to-income ratio, , a¤ects consumption decisions in
three ways: i) it determines after-tax income; ii) it reduces the elasticity of consumption
spending with respect to real interest rates; and iii) it indexes wealth e¤ects on consumption
spending that result from variations in the real value of government debt holdings. To interpret
these e¤ects further it is useful to consider aggregate consumption demand. Aggregating over

Using the fact that total household income is the sum of dividend and wage income, combined with the
…rst-order conditions for labor supply and consumption, delivers a decision rule for consumption that depends
only on forecasts of prices: that is, goods prices, nominal interest rates, wages and dividends. However, we
make the simplifying assumption that households forecast total income, the sum of dividend payments and
wages received.

equal to zero. However, agents might face uncertainty about the current …scal regime in place.9
And under arbitrary subjective expectations, households may incorrectly forecast future tax
obligations and real interest rates, leading to holdings of the public debt being perceived as
net wealth: Ricardian equivalence need not hold out of rational expectations equilibrium.
The failure of Ricardian equivalence leads to wealth e¤ects on consumption demand, and the
magnitude of these e¤ects is indexed by the structural surplus-to-output ratio, or equivalently
the debt-to-output ratio as these steady state quantities are proportional. On average, the
more indebted an economy the larger are the e¤ects on demand. This is shown to be important
in the design of stabilization policy.
Finally, note that if either the debt-to-output ratio is zero or the intertemporal budget
constraint is for some reason known to hold by households, then consumption demand is
determined by the second term only, delivering the model analyzed by Preston (2005, 2006).10
Those papers consider the case of a zero-debt …scal policy, understood to hold in all future
periods so that households need not forecast taxes. This paper extends that analysis to a
considerably broader class of …scal policies that agents must learn about — with non-trivial
consequence.

is a measure of current in‡ation and

0. The central bank does not observe

in‡ation in real time and, like private agents, has an incomplete model of the economy. For
simplicity, it is assumed the central bank has the same forecasting model for in‡ation as private
agents. This is easily generalized. The nominal interest rate rule satis…es the approximation
^{t =

Etcb 1 ^ t :

11

(6)

The precise details of this assumption are not important to the ensuing analysis so long as in the log
linear approximation future pro…ts are discounted at the rate T t .

11

This class of rule has had considerable popularity in the recent literature on monetary
policy. It ensures determinacy of rational expectations equilibrium if the Taylor principle is
satis…ed under certain assumptions about …scal policy and exhibits other robustness properties
noted by Batini and Haldane (1999) and Levin, Wieland, and Williams (2003). This has led
to advocacy of forecast-based instrument rules for the implementation of monetary policy.
Indeed, such policy rules appear in a number of central bank forecasting models. Furthermore,
Clarida, Gali and Gertler (1998, 2000) adduce empirical evidence for a related class of interest
rate reaction functions in which the central bank responds to forecasts of next-period in‡ation.
Similar results hold for such rules.
The study of optimal policy is not pursued on two grounds. If appropriately chosen,
simple rules deliver much of the welfare gains inherent in more complex optimal policy rules
— see Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2005). Second, optimal policy in the context of learning
dynamics is not trivial. Assumptions have to be made about the precise information a central
bank has about the structure of the economy. While households and …rms need only know
their own objectives and constraints to make decisions, for a central bank to design optimal
policy requires accurate information on all agents in the economy, including beliefs. However,
Preston (2006) shows that appropriate choice of stochastic intercept in (6) can implement
optimal policy, implying all subsequent stability results would continue to apply.
Fiscal Policy: The …scal authority …nances government purchases of g per period by
issuing public debt and levying lump-sum taxes. Denoting Bt as the outstanding government
debt at the beginning of any period t, and assuming for simplicity that the public debt is
comprised entirely of one-period riskless nominal Treasury bills, government liabilities evolve
according to
Bt+1 = (1 + it ) [Bt + gPt

The average expectations operator does not satisfy the law of iterated expectations due to
the assumption of completely imperfect common knowledge on the part of all households and
…rms. Because agents do not know the beliefs, objectives and constraints of other households
and …rms in the economy, they cannot infer aggregate probability laws. This is the property
of the irreducibility of long-horizon forecasts noted by Preston (2005).
To summarize, the model comprises the structural relations (6), (7), (8), (10) and (11).
The model is closed with the speci…cation of beliefs, described next.

Learning: Belief Formation and the Policy Regime

Beliefs. This section describes the central bank’s and market participants’learning behavior
and the criterion to assess convergence of beliefs. The optimal decisions of households and
14

…rms require forecasting the evolution of future real interest rates, income, taxes and in‡ation.
The central bank has only to forecast the current in‡ation rate. For in‡ation and income (or
output gap), agents are assumed to use a linear econometric model, relating in‡ation and
income to the evolution of real government debt. That is
x^t = ! x0 + ! x0 ^bt + ext

(12)

^ t = ! 0 + ! 0 ^bt + et

(13)

where ext and et are i.i.d. disturbances. The model contains the same variables that appear
in the minimum state variable rational expectations solutions to the model that result under
the various policy con…gurations described in the next section.14 And while the rational expectations solution does not contain a constant, it has a natural interpretation under learning
of capturing uncertainty about the steady state.
Concerning the nominal interest rate, the …scal surplus and debt dynamics, agents’forecasts depend on their knowledge about the monetary and …scal regimes in place. Consider
…rst the monetary policy regime. As in Eusepi and Preston (2007a), uncertainty about the
monetary policy regime is captured by assuming that agents do not know the monetary policy
rule (6). In this case agents use the model
^{t = ! i0 + ! i0^bt + eit

(14)

which is consistent with the minimum state variable rational expectations solutions under the
various monetary and …scal regimes described in the next section. If agents know the current
monetary policy regime, then, given their beliefs about future in‡ation, they use the rule (6)
to compute policy consistent forecasts of the future path of the nominal interest rate.15
Throughout the paper we assume that market participants face uncertainty about the
…scal regime. Agents need to forecast the future evolution of the …scal surplus and the future
evolution of debt (which is also needed to predict the evolution of output and in‡ation). Their

de…ning agents’ forecast functions and current prices and quantities. However, to compare
the model under learning with the predictions under rational expectations, we assume that
agents’expectations are determined simultaneously with consumption, labor supply and pricing decisions, so that agents observe all variables that are determined at time t, including

since it is based on t

Rational Expectations: Leeper Revisited

In the standard account of monetary policy design, nominal interest rates are determined
actively to stabilize in‡ation and output. Less emphasized, but no less important, is the
accompanying assumption that …scal policy is Ricardian — taxes are assumed to adjust in
such a way as to ensure intertemporal solvency of the government budget. Under these
assumptions, a central recommendation is that monetary policy should satisfy the Taylor
principle: nominal interest rates should be adjusted more than one for one with variations in
in‡ation. As shown by Leeper (1991), however, other con…gurations of policy are consistent
with determinacy of rational expectations equilibrium. They involve a more active role for a
…scal policy which is non-Ricardian in nature and has monetary consequences. Here we revisit
the …scal theory of the price level and the determinacy properties of our model under rational
expectations. Ricardian and non-Ricardian …scal policies are formally de…ned. The following
characterizes the set of unique equilibria under the rational expectations assumption. The
analysis is analogous to Leeper (1991), though in the context of the model of section 2. All
proofs are collected in the appendix.
Proposition 1 There exist unique bounded rational expectations equilibria of the indicated
form if and only if the following conditions are satis…ed: either

stable if all eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix D [ (! 0 ; ! 1 ) (! 0 ; ! 1 )] have negative real parts (where D
denotes the di¤erentiation operator and the Jacobian is understood to be evaluated at the relevant rational
expectations equilibrium).

18

The descriptors locally Ricardian and non-Ricardian refer to the combined implications
of the government’s ‡ow budget constraint and tax policy. When 1 <

< (1 + ) = (1

)

the eigenvalue of the di¤erence equation (7) is inside the unit circle, and, for all bounded
sequences f t ; it g; real debt converges to its steady state value. Because taxes are adjusted
to ensure intertemporal solvency of the government accounts for all possible paths of the price
level, this con…guration of …scal policy is termed locally Ricardian, where locally refers to the
use of a log-linear approximation. In the language of Leeper this is passive …scal policy. In
contrast, if either 0

< 1 or

> (1 + ) = (1

), then the eigenvalue is outside the

unit circle and real debt dynamics are inherently explosive. It is this property that requires
a speci…c path of the price level to ensure solvency of the intertemporal accounts. Hence,
locally non-Ricardian, or in the language of Leeper, active …scal policy.
Whether …scal policy is locally Ricardian or non-Ricardian has implications for macroeconomic dynamics. In the former case, in‡ation dynamics are independent of the public debt.
In the latter case, the path of real debt has consequences for the determination of in‡ation
dynamics. To assist interpretation of subsequent results, note that the equilibrium coe¢ cient
1

is larger, the smaller are the policy coe¢ cients

and

. In the limit

;

! 0, the

elasticity of in‡ation in response to variations in debt is largest. In the non-Ricardian regimes
analyzed in the sequel, agents forecast in‡ation as a function of debt, and debt is shown to
generate stabilizing wealth e¤ects through expectations formation. These wealth e¤ects are
therefore largest when policy responds little to endogenous developments in the economy. The
conditions for determinacy of rational expectations equilibrium in each regime are referred to
as the Leeper conditions.19
19

Two other classes of equilibria are possible. One concerns the case of Ricardian …scal policy combined with
a passive monetary policy satisfying 0 <
< 1. In this case, there is indeterminacy of rational expectations
equilibrium for all parameter values. It is easily demonstrated that none of these equilibria is stable under
the alternative non-rational expectations assumption being considered. The second concerns the case of nonRicardian …scal policy and monetary policy satisfying the Taylor principle. Under rational expectations it can
be shown that there exist a class of unbounded equilibria that have explosive debt and in‡ation dynamics.

Monetary and Fiscal Regime Uncertainty

Having laid out preparatory foundations, the analysis turns to the consequences of regime
uncertainty for stabilization policy. One …nal assumption is required to facilitate analytical
results: the economy is assumed to have only a small degree of nominal rigidity. Formally,
the conditions for expectational stability are studied in the neighborhood of the limit,

! 0.

This is not equivalent to analyzing a ‡exible price economy. For an arbitrary degree of nominal
friction, 0 <

< 1, analytical results are unavailable except in two special cases.20 Section 7

also provides some more general numerical examples.

5.1

Regime uncertainty constrains the menu of policies consistent with expectations stabilization relative to the class of policies given by the Leeper conditions. If …scal policy is
locally Ricardian then monetary policy must be highly aggressive to prevent self-ful…lling
expectations. For many monetary policies satisfying the Taylor principle there is no choice

explores related issues and the consequences of the debt maturity structure for stabilization policy.

20

of …scal policy that can guarantee stability. The restriction on the choice of monetary policy
depends on the households’discount factor, , since this parameter regulates the impact of
revisions to expectations about future macroeconomic conditions on current spending and
pricing decisions. The more patient are households the larger will be the impact on current
macroeconomic conditions.
If …scal policy is non-Ricardian there are greater incentives to coordinate monetary and
…scal policy relative to a rational expectations analysis of the model. Indeed, under rational expectations, conditional on monetary policy being passive, any choice of locally nonRicardian …scal policy delivers a unique bounded rational expectations equilibrium. Under
regime uncertainty this is no longer true. The precise choice of monetary policy constrains the
set of …scal policies consistent with macroeconomic stability. However, for a given choice of
monetary policy there always exists a choice of …scal policy that prevents expectations-driven
instability. Part 2(b) of the proposition shows that a …scal policy, characterized by either an
exogenous surplus or an extremely aggressive …scal rule, is conducive to macroeconomic stability for all parameter con…gurations.21 Thus, perhaps surprisingly, non-Ricardian regimes
appear to be more robust to learning dynamics.
Worth emphasizing is that the learning behavior of both private agents and the central
bank engenders the instability result. If the central bank could perfectly observe current
in‡ation, then the stability conditions under learning are the Leeper conditions: the same
restrictions implied by local determinacy.22 The analysis thus shows that the addition of
realistic assumptions about the information set of the central bank has important implications
for the performance of simple rules that would not emerge under rational expectations.
Under uncertainty about both the …scal and monetary regime, stability is independent of
average indebtedness. Determinacy of rational expectations equilibrium is similarly independent of this object. The sequel demonstrates that under non-rational expectations this is not
generally true. If uncertainty about the monetary policy regime is resolved, the e¢ cacy of
stabilization policy can hinge on the indebtedness of the economy and, therefore, uncertainty

In fact, it can be shown that with an interest peg and an exogenous surplus, E-stability holds for an
arbitrary degee of nominal rigidities. A proof is available in a technical appendix.

in the following corollary.
Corollary 3 Under regime uncertainty, macroeconomic stabilization policy is independent of
the average indebtedness of the economy.
What are the sources of instability and stability under learning dynamics? The next
section considers a simple example to provide intuition for the robustness of the non-Ricardian
regime. The general case is then discussed.

In the special case

(26)

and observed dynamics are independent of agents’beliefs. Indeed, relation (26) corresponds to
the restriction between in‡ation and debt that obtains in a rational expectations equilibrium
under the maintained assumptions. Given T (! ; ! b ) = 1, the associated ordinary di¤erential
equations characterizing learning dynamics are
!_ = 1

! and !_ b =

!b;

implying stability for all parameter values.
More generally, stability under learning depends on the relation between in‡ation and
government debt. Suppose agents’ in‡ation expectations increase for unmodelled reasons
— formally ! > 1. The increase in in‡ation expectations leads to an increase in current
in‡ation, with the increase being larger the smaller is

. Simultaneously, higher in‡ation

decreases the real value of next-period holdings of the public debt, which in turn lowers
expectations. In the limiting case,

! 0, in‡ation remains unchanged — the two e¤ects on

in‡ation are equal and opposite. In the more general case, with 0 <

< 1, the initial rise in

in‡ation expectations is not validated by subsequent in‡ation data and the agents’estimate
of ! converges back to its rational expectations equilibrium value. As long as agents’beliefs
permit a possible relation between in‡ation and real debt, as assumed in this paper, their
learning process converges to rational expectations equilibrium.

5.3

Aggregate Demand Management and Instability

Now consider the general case. The mechanism generating instability is the same in both
Ricardian and non-Ricardian regimes and depends fundamentally on monetary policy. Consider an increase in in‡ation expectations in the locally Ricardian regime. Aggregate demand
rises immediately, as does in‡ation. The initial monetary policy response is weak because the
nominal interest rate is set before observing current prices. As in‡ation increases, the central
23

bank revises its expectations of current in‡ation and starts increasing the nominal interest
rate more than proportionally, as dictated by the Taylor Principle. Because private agents
do not know the policy rule their expected path for the interest rate is ‡atter than under full
knowledge of the policy rule: as a consequence, the gradual increase in the nominal interest
rate has little initial e¤ect on in‡ation expectations. As in‡ation continues to rise, the central
bank adjusts policy until in‡ation expectations and actual in‡ation start declining. Eventually interest rates are too high and the economy contracts. A process of recessions followed by
expansions ensues, leading to instability. Uncertainty about both the policy rule and the delay in the monetary policy response drive instability. Failure to manage expectations through
e¤ective restraint of aggregate demand generates destabilizing dynamics.

23

A similar process occurs in the non-Ricardian regime if the policy rule prescribes a su¢ ciently aggressive response to in‡ation that it dominates the stabilizing wealth e¤ects of real
debt on in‡ation expectations, as described in the simple example. Proposition 2 also implies
that for

! 1,

< 0:5 guarantees stability independently of

stability depends on the …scal rule. Furthermore, a …scal rule with

. For higher values of
>

can be shown to

weaken the rational expectations equilibrium relation between real debt and in‡ation, making in‡ation expectations less responsive to the level of real debt. As a result, under learning
dynamics, the wealth e¤ects operating through the intertemporal budget constraint of the
government that are embedded in household and …rm beliefs, are weaker, and therefore less
of a stabilizing force. Section 7 further discusses this case.

6

Resolving Uncertainty about Monetary Policy

To isolate the role of uncertainty about the …scal regime, we follow Eusepi and Preston (2007a),
and consider the bene…ts of credibly communicating the monetary policy rule to …rms and
households. The precise details of the monetary policy rule are announced, including the
policy coe¢ cients and conditioning variables. Knowledge of this rule serves to simplify …rms’
and households’ forecasting problems. Indeed, agents need only forecast in‡ation: policy
23

Eusepi and Preston (2007a) discuss in detail the case of a known Ricardian regime with zero net supply
of bonds.

24

consistent forecasts of future nominal interest rates can then be determined directly from
the announced policy rule. It follows that credible announcements have the property that
expectations about future macroeconomic conditions are consistent with the policy strategy
of the monetary authority.24
Under communication of the policy regime the aggregate demand equation becomes

determined by direct substitution of the monetary policy rule into equation (10). The remaining model equations are unchanged with the exception of beliefs. As nominal interest rates
need not be forecast, an agent’s vector autoregression model is estimated on the restricted
state vector zt = x^t ; ^ t ; s^t ; ^bt+1 : Knowledge of the regime does not eliminate uncertainty
about the statistical laws determining state variables, as future output, in‡ation, taxes and
real debt must still be forecasted to make spending and pricing decisions.

expectational stability if the following conditions are satis…ed: either

25

Regardless of the regime, guarding against expectations-driven instability for a given choice
of tax rule,

, requires a choice of monetary policy rule that depends on two model para-

meters: the household’s discount factor, , and the steady state ratio of the primary surplus
to output,

(or equivalently the steady state debt-to-output ratio since s = (1

) b). The

choice of …scal regime, re‡ected in the implied average debt-to-output ratio, imposes constraints on stabilization policy. Less …scally responsible governments have access to a smaller
set of monetary policies to ensure learnability of rational expectations equilibrium. In the case
of locally Ricardian …scal policies, the higher is the average debt-to-output ratio, the more
aggressive must monetary policy be to protect the economy from self-ful…lling expectations.
Similarly, under locally non-Ricardian …scal policies, the choice of monetary policy is again
constrained by the average level of indebtedness of the economy. The higher are average debt
levels the more passive must be the adopted monetary policy rule. Regardless of the policy
regime, for 0 <

< 1, the menu of policies consistent with stabilizing expectations is larger

than when agents are uncertain about the policy regime — compare proposition 2. This
discussion is summarized in the following proposition which presents two special cases of the
above results.
Proposition 6 Communication unambiguously improves stabilization policy under learning
dynamics. That is, for 0 < < 1, a larger menu of …scal and monetary policies is consistent
with expectations stabilization under knowledge of the policy regime than under regime uncertainty. When ! 1, the regions of stability in the communication and no communication
cases coincide. When = 0, the Leeper conditions are restored.
That the stability of expectations depends on a steady state quantity through

is surpris-

ing when compared to a rational expectations analysis. Indeed, the model indicates determinacy of equilibrium conditions to be independent of this quantity. What then is the source of
this dependence?
Proposition 4 makes clear that the choice of monetary policy,

, and the steady state

structural surplus-to-output ratio, , play a crucial role in determining stability, in both
Ricardian and non-Ricardian policy regimes. The main source of instability is a second class
of wealth e¤ects — distinct to those discussed earlier — arising from violations of Ricardian
equivalence: agents perceive real bonds as net wealth out of rational expectations equilibrium.
26

To provide intuition, consider a regime with active monetary policy and passive …scal
policy. Again, suppose that in‡ation expectations increase. Agents correctly predict a steeper
path of the nominal interest rate, which restrains aggregate demand, leading to lower actual
in‡ation. In an economy with zero net debt, this would decrease expectations driving the
economy back to equilibrium. But with holdings of the public debt treated as net wealth,
lower in‡ation generates a positive wealth e¤ect, stimulating aggregate demand and increasing
in‡ationary pressures. The increase in real debt is higher if the monetary authority does not
observe current prices because the nominal interest rate does not immediately decrease with
in‡ation. On the one hand, active policy restrains demand as agents expect higher future
real interest rates. On the other hand, larger real debt and higher expected nominal interest
rates generate wealth e¤ects with in‡ationary consequences. If the monetary policy rule is
not su¢ ciently active and the stock of government debt is large the latter prevail, leading to
instability.
Further insight into this result can be obtained by considering a more general form of
utility function with constant consumption intertemporal elasticity of substitution,

as in the case of uncertainty about the monetary policy regime.26 However, the underlying
mechanism that generates instability is quite di¤erent.
A similar logic operates with passive monetary policy and active …scal policy. Following
an increase in in‡ation expectations, output and in‡ation increase, stimulated by a decline
in real interest rates. As in the simple example discussed in section 5.2, the positive relation
between real debt and in‡ation drives the economy back to equilibrium. But higher in‡ation
can also have a destabilizing e¤ect because it leads to a higher expected path for the nominal
interest rate, increasing the real value of interest payments on outstanding government debt.
This positive wealth e¤ect increases aggregate demand and in‡ation. If the latter e¤ect
is su¢ ciently strong the combination of monetary and …scal policy can be destabilizing.27
That is, if monetary policy is su¢ ciently aggressive and the steady state level of real debt is
su¢ ciently high, then in‡ationary e¤ects dominate, leading to instability.

Dynamics, Regime Uncertainty and the Public Debt

The above theoretical results focus on the asymptotic convergence properties of agents’learning dynamics. This section has two goals. First, it shows that even when policy ensures
convergence to rational expectations, uncertainty about the policy regime still has important
e¤ects on model dynamics. Second, it develops intuition on how the economy responds to
shifts in agents’expectations, elucidating the sources of expectations-driven instability. The
main source of instability is the delayed response of the central bank and private agents to
changing economic conditions. On the one hand, monetary policy a¤ects the economy with
a delay because of agents’ learning process. On the other hand, monetary policy responds
with a delay to developments in current in‡ation because of imperfect information. The interaction between these two delays generates dynamics that are signi…cantly di¤erent from
rational expectations.
To this end, we present impulse response functions to a “small” shock to in‡ation ex26

Notice that the conditions for determinacy are not a¤ected by .
It can be shown that the higher , the smaller the parameter set for which we have stability. In fact
the larger is
the weaker the relation between real debt and in‡ation, and the more important the wealth
e¤ects from higher nominal rates.

pectations. Two experiments are considered. The …rst examines model dynamics under a
non-Ricardian …scal regime when there is either imperfect or perfect knowledge of monetary
policy. The analysis delineates the role of real debt dynamics in stabilizing in‡ation expectations and clari…es the destabilizing role of monetary policy when agents have no knowledge
of the regime. The second experiment explores the role of the debt-to-output ratio in model
dynamics. The monetary policy regime is assumed to be known and …scal policy is Ricardian.
High debt economies are demonstrated to be prone to instability because holdings of the
public debt are perceived as net wealth. In this case, the wealth e¤ects induced by changes
in the value of real debt from a shock to in‡ation expectations are destabilizing.

7.1

Generating Impulse Response Functions

The impulse response functions to a shock to in‡ation expectations are generated as follows.
The model is simulated 5000 times assuming shocks to the natural rate, monetary policy
and tax policy have standard deviations:

r

= 1,

i

= 0:1 and

= 0:1.28 In contrast to

the analytical results, the simulations make more general assumptions about the degree of
nominal rigidities and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. For the chosen calibration,
the rational expectations equilibrium is stable under learning. In both experiments we assume
= 0:99 for a quarterly calibration. The Calvo parameter is …xed at

= 0:6, consistent with

Blinder, Canetti, Lebow, and Rudd (1998) and Bils and Klenow (2004). Finally, we consider
a utility function with intertemporal elasticity of substitution of consumption equal to 0:3,
consistent with broad …ndings in the macroeconomics literature.
The impulse response functions are computed by perturbing each simulated path by an
expectational shock. The di¤erence between these perturbed paths and the original paths
provides the impulse response functions. They are non-linear because of the learning dynamics and the plotted paths correspond to the median impulse response over 5000 simulations.
The perturbation is done by increasing the initial beliefs about the constant in the in‡ation
equation, a

;0 ,

from zero (the parameter’s rational expectations equilibrium value) to 0:01.

This represents an increase in in‡ation expectations at all forecast horizons. It can be inter28

Shocks to the policy rules are added to prevent agents from learning the policy coe¢ cients after few data
points. However, their inclusion does not a¤ect the stability results.

29

preted as a small shift in the perceived in‡ation target, or in the long-run in‡ation average.
All other coe¢ cients are initially set to their rational expectations values.
A decreasing gain is employed so that gt = gt

1 +1

where g0 is chosen to be large enough to

ensure that beliefs remain in the basin of attraction — recall the theoretical results are local
characterizations of dynamics. Hence, with su¢ cient data the analytical results of the paper
guarantee beliefs will converge to the rational expectations equilibrium of the model, given
appropriate choice of policy. A high choice of g0 is equivalent to having a tight prior on the
initial beliefs (in our experiments we chose g0 = 50). A consequence, relevant to interpreting
the impulse response functions, is the slow convergence to rational expectations equilibrium.
There is no attempt here for empirical realism. Rather we seek to draw out general lessons
about the mechanisms underlying model dynamics.29

7.2

Stabilizing Wealth E¤ects

The …rst experiment considers a shock to in‡ation expectations when monetary policy is
passive but responsive to expected in‡ation:

= 0:9. Fiscal policy is non-Ricardian and

responds weakly to changes in aggregate debt:

= 0:05. This latter assumption emphasizes

the stabilizing wealth e¤ects coming from the revaluation of outstanding debt. The structural
surplus-to-output ratio, , is chosen to give a debt-to-output ratio of 0:5 in steady state.30
Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate that uncertainty about the monetary policy regime generates
signi…cant ampli…cation of a shock to expectations and impairs control of the macroeconomy.
If market participants have no knowledge of the monetary policy rule, in‡ation, output and
nominal interest rates display substantial variation relative to the case where the monetary
policy regime is known. Irrespective, dynamics converge to rational expectations equilibrium.
The expectation shock initially increases long-term in‡ation expectations. This leads to
an increase in in‡ation and output, as future real interest rates are expected to fall. This is
29

However, Eusepi and Preston (2008) demonstrate that learning dynamics represent a promising approach
to …tting observed business cycles.
30
As evidenced by the propositions, the precise choice of is not too important when there is uncertainty
about the regime — the local stability properties are independent of this quantity.

^ T +1 ) :

T =t

If there is uncertainty about the monetary policy regime, agents fail to correctly anticipate
the increase in nominal interest rates, producing a much larger drop in the expected real
rate than in the case when agents know the regime. Real debt falls on impact because of
higher in‡ation. Because beliefs about in‡ation in a non-Ricardian equilibrium are a linear
function of debt, short-term in‡ation expectations fall. In fact, Figure 3 shows that the
short term real rate increases.31 Real debt continues to fall after the shock, even though
in‡ation declines (the impulse response for real debt is not reported because it mimics the
response of in‡ation). Figure 2 reveals this happens because the nominal interest rate falls
more than current in‡ation. The lower nominal interest rate re‡ects the fact that the central
bank is initially under predicting in‡ation; actual in‡ation declines less than expected in‡ation
because of higher marginal costs induced by high demand.32 Over time, the persistent decrease
in real debt decreases long-term in‡ation expectations, which induce an increase in expected
real rates, decreasing aggregate demand until convergence back to equilibrium.
Finally, when the monetary policy rule is known to agents, the economy exhibits much less
variability: the response to the in‡ation shock is actually very close to what would happen
under rational expectations where the economy stays at the steady state (expectations are
anchored by construction in a rational expectations equilibrium). Agents correctly predict
that the nominal interest rate is going to increase with expected in‡ation, resulting in a much
smaller decrease in the long-term real interest rate. The example underscores that even under
a regime where price dynamics are not independent of …scal variables, uncertainty about the
monetary policy regime can have profound in‡uence on the economy’s response to shocks.
31

This does not immediately a¤ect long-term expectations because the initial shock to expectations a¤ect
the perceived in‡ation steady state, while changes in real bonds have only temporary e¤ects on in‡ation.
32
In particular, according to the Phillips curve, lower in‡ation expectations decrease actual in‡ation but
this decrease is balanced by the high marginal cost of production.

31

7.3

The Role of Indebtedness: …scal e¤ects in a Ricardian regime

The second experiment explores the constraints imposed on policy by the average level of
indebtedness. Market participants have full knowledge about the monetary policy regime,
but still face uncertainty about the …scal regime. We then consider the dynamic response of
the economy to the same in‡ation shock considered above, under di¤erent assumptions about
the steady state level of government debt in the economy. Monetary policy is speci…ed as
= 1:5 and …scal policy as

= 4. Two levels of average indebtedness are considered: a low

debt economy, which has a debt-to-output ratio of zero on average,

= 0; and a high steady

state debt economy with a debt-to-output ratio of 4b=Y = 2:3 (in annual terms). While the
latter is arguably large, it is chosen to emphasize the dynamics that operate in a high debt
economy. It is also the only asset that can be held in this economy — there is no capital. The
remaining model parameters are determined as before. Both the low and high debt economies
satisfy the local stability conditions of proposition 4.
Figures 4 - 6 plot the impulse responses for output, in‡ation and nominal interest rates.
The impulse responses for the high debt economy are distinguished by smaller impact e¤ects
and greater persistence. To understand the nature of these di¤erences it is useful to decompose
aggregate demand into the following terms

represents the dynamics that would

obtain in a zero-debt economy, or equivalently, one in which households understood the government to be intertemporally solvent.

;t

captures departures from this benchmark, repre-

senting deviations from Ricardian equivalence because holdings of the public debt are treated
32

as net wealth. Precisely, it is the real value of holdings of the public debt once future tax and
interest obligations are accounted for. Figures 7 and 8 plot these two terms. It is immediate
that

;t

generates destabilizing demand e¤ects in a high debt economy. These wealth e¤ects

are distinct from those analyzed in the previous section, which result from beliefs tying the
evolution of in‡ation and output to real debt.
In a regime with zero steady state debt, active monetary policy increases the expected
future path of real rates reducing demand, and, in turn, curbing in‡ation until the economy
returns to rational expectations equilibrium — see Figure 9 which plots the real long rate.
In an economy with high steady state debt this channel is still present. However, deviations
from Ricardian equivalence drive aggregate demand in the opposite direction. The term

;t

initially rises because: i) taxes are predetermined at the time of the shock and only rise over
time; ii) agents anticipate higher future real interest rates, which deliver a positive income
e¤ect from holding the public debt; and iii) there is a valuation e¤ect from the initial fall in
in‡ation. For these reasons, the impact e¤ects of in‡ation shock on output and in‡ation are
smaller in the high debt economy.
Figure 10 shows that the value of real debt outstanding rises over time as prices fall,
preventing a fast adjustment to the steady state equilibrium. The rise in real debt occurs
because the central bank over predicts in‡ation. As a result, actual in‡ation is below the
nominal interest rate (as a function of expected in‡ation). Since monetary policy is active,
in‡ation below steady state induces negative expected real rates. This stimulates output (as
the

R;t

terms becomes larger than the

;t

term), which eventually increases above its steady

state value, together with in‡ation. However, over time long rates and taxes adjust to reduce
outstanding public debt and stabilize in‡ation, inducing convergence. As in the previous
experiment, there is a tight link between monetary and …scal policy. Active monetary policy
might not be su¢ cient to stabilize expectations if market participants face uncertainty about
the …scal regime and the government faces su¢ ciently high long-term debt.

33

Conclusions

A model is developed to explore the constraints imposed on stabilization policy by expectations formation. Speci…c emphasis is given to household and …rm uncertainty about the
prevailing policy regime adopted by the central bank and …scal authority.
Two central results emerge. First, when agents have no knowledge about the policy
regime, stabilization policy is more di¢ cult than under a rational expectations analysis of the
model. The set of policies consistent with expectations stabilization is substantially reduced.
Indeed, for a class of monetary policies satisfying the Taylor principle, there is no choice
of …scal policy that prevents self-ful…lling expectations. For passive monetary policy, there
is always a choice of non-Ricardian …scal policy that ensures stability. The precise choice
depends on the speci…c monetary policy being implemented. An implication is that under
non-rational expectations, tighter coordination of monetary and …scal policy is desirable.
That non-Ricardian …scal policies emerge to be relatively robust to expectational instability
stems from two model properties: i) passive monetary policies minimize uncertainty about
the future path of nominal interest rates and ii) stabilizing wealth e¤ects that operate through
the intertemporal budget constraint of the government.
Second, under full knowledge of the monetary policy regime, stabilization policy is unambiguously improved across both Ricardian and non-Ricardian regimes. That active monetary
policies are no longer a source of instability is a direct consequence of households being able to
accurately project the future path of real interest rates when the monetary policy strategy is
known. Similarly, under non-Ricardian …scal policies, passive monetary policy induces less uncertainty about the path of nominal interest rates, enhancing the e¤ectiveness of stabilization
policy.
Complete knowledge of monetary strategy does not ensure that all policies consistent with
determinacy of rational expectations are similarly consistent with expectational stability under learning dynamics. Whether they are or not, depends on the average level of indebtedness
of the economy. Because households imperfectly forecast future tax obligations, holdings of
the public debt are perceived as net wealth. As a result, variations in outstanding debt lead to
Keynesian expenditure e¤ects, and these e¤ects can be destabilizing. The magnitude of these
34

wealth e¤ects are proportional to the steady state debt-to-output ratio. The more heavily
indebted the economy the more di¢ cult it is to stabilize the macroeconomy.

Stability under learning

As explained above, convergence of the learning process depends on the stability properties
of the ODE (33). This is a fairly complicated convolutions of the agent’s beliefs (! 0 ; ! 1 ). In
order to …nd analytical conditions for convergence we make use of Matlab symbolic toolbox.
The expressions can be reproduced by running the appropriate …les, available on request from
the authors.

Proof of Proposition 2

Ricardian regime The results reported in this proof can be reproduced using the Matlab …le:
…scal_delay_benchmark.m. First, it can be shown that the beliefs (! 0 ; ! 1 ) evolve according
to two separate sub-systems
I5 ) ! 0 and !_ 1 = (B

!_ 0 = (A

I5 ) ! 1 :

where A and B represent components of the Jacobian of T (! 0 ; ! 1 ), evaluated at the rational
expectations equilibrium ! 0 ; ! 1 , de…ned in the previous proposition.
Consider the evolution of the intercept ! 0 . We take three steps in order to reduce the
matrix A from a …ve dimensional to three dimensional object. First, evaluating the matrix A
reveals that
!_ s0 =

! s0 :

Hence, the intercept in the …scal rule equation converges for all parameter values, independently of the other elements of the beliefs vector. This reduces dimensionality by one. Second,
using the restriction

A5;j =

A2;j + A3;j for j = 1:::5

delivers the three dimension system (see the Matlab …le for the details of the variables’transformation):
