Are Tax Cuts Really Expansionary?

ABSTRACT

In this paper, we re—examine the standard analysis of the short—run

effect of a personal tax cut. If consumer spending generates more money
demand than other components of GNP, then tax cuts may,

by

increasing the

demand for money, depress aggregate demand. We examine a variety of evidence
and conclude that the necessary condition for contractionary tax cuts is
probably satisfied for the U.S. economy.

This paper re—examines the standard Keynesian analysis of the short—rin

effect

The textbook conclusion is that a tax cut

expands aggregate demand and output so long as the money supply is held
constant. Conversely, a tax increase is contractionary according to the
conventional analysis. This result, however, is sensitive to the form of

the money demand function.1 In particular, if consumer expenditure generates

more money demand than other components of GNP, as is plausible a

priori, then the effect of a tax cut on aggregate demand is in general ambi-

guous. If money demand is sufficiently interest inelastic, then tax cuts
are contractionary.
Theory thus does

not provide a clear answer to the question of whether

cuts are expansionary. Despite its

importance for macro—economic

policy, however, there is surprisingly little empirical work addressing this

issue. As we discuss more fully below, the existing studies of money demand
do not support the textbook formulation. Moreover, tax cuts have historically been coupled with accomodating monetary policy. Case studies of these
policy interventions can shed only little light on the question of what the
effects would have been bad the monetary authority held the money supply

constant.

Although simulations

of macro—econometric models support the

address. Existing empirical work, therefore, provides little evidence upon

the very- least, this conclusion implies that tax cuts are much less

than is

widely believed. Whether they are expansionary- at all

depends upon parameters of the IS curve as well as those of the LM curve.
Using estimates from other studies, we show that the condition for tax cuts
to be contractionary appears to be satisfied for the U.S. econoiiy.

Our results have implications for recent policy- discussions. Since a
more monetarist policy environment prevailed in the period between 1979 and
1983, the large tax cuts during this period may have been partly responsible

for the deep recession and the concurrent reduction in inflation. Moreover,
tax increases to reduce the large current and prospective deficits are not
likely to depress the econoir unless the Fed responds to them by reducing
the rate of money growth.
This analysis o± fiscal policy follows the standard practice of'

assuming the money supply is held fixed. In practice, however, the monetary

authority is unlikely to ignore the actions of the fical authority. Even
if the monetary authority is non—reactive,

the effects of fiscal policy rest

critically on the rule the monetary authority is following. For example,
even if tax cuts are contractionary under a constant money supply rule, they
are

nonetheless expansionary under an interest rate rule and

under

a nominal GNP rule.

It is impossible to examine fiscal policy in a

vacuum.
Section II of this paper demonstrates the theoretical importance of the

money demand specification for the sign of the tax multiplier. Section III

examines the evidence, both econometric and non—econometric, on the scale
variable in the money demand function. Section IV discusses the historical
experience with two tax cuts: the l961

tax

cut and the 1981 tax cut.

Section V concludes with a discussion of implications for policy and directions for future research.

II. Theory-

Here we work with a slight extension of the textbook Keynesian IS—LM

model. We examine the effects of fiscal policy only on the aggregate demand
schedule. We do not address the issue of the appropriate aggregate supply
function. Our model is fully consistent with a variety of theories of
aggregate supply. In particular, to examine the impact of fiscal policy on
the level of output, our model could be coupled with a traditional Phillips
curve, a Lucas 11973] supply function, a model of nominal wage contracts
(Fischer [1977], Taylor [1980]), or a model of price stickiness (Okun

[19821, Rotemberg [1983], Manklv [1983]). The aggregate demand schedule is
the locus of price levels P and output levels Y that satisfy the IS and LM

curves. Without loss of generality, we can hold the price level P fixed;
changes in output Y thus represent shifts in the aggregate demand schedule.

As we discuss below, this condition seems

likely to be satisfied in practice. Expression (6)

condition for expansionary- tax cuts. It is less clear whether this con

To illustrate the ichanism driving the results graphically, consider
the special case of the model in which money demand depends only upon con-

sumer expenditure. Equation (2) becomes

L(C(Y—T,r),r).

As in the standard analysis, a reduction in taxes causes an expansionary

shift in the IS curve. As shown in Figure 1, at any interest rate, the tax
cut raises consumption and thereby- increases the equilibrium level of out-

put. Contrary to the standard analysis, a tax cut also shifts the LM curve
in a contractionai-y direction. At any given level of income and interest

rate, consumption and thus money demand is greater. The net effect of the
tax cut on the level of output is ambiguous, as the IS and LM curves shift
in opposite directions.

Equation (2') suggests another model in which tax cuts are potentially

contractionary. If money demand depends on disposable income, then a tax
cut also shifts the LM curve in a contractionary direction. We concentrate

B. A Preliminary Calculation

Before proceeding any further, we consider whether the condition for a

contractionary tax cut is possibly satisfied. Suppose that consumer expenditure is the correct scale variable, as in equation (2'). Are the parameters of the IS and LM curves in the range necessary

If only C generates money demand, then expression (6) implies that a

To ge.uge the sign of the tax multiplier, we must obtain estimates of these

It seems reasonable to posit that the quantity elasiticity of
demand is somewhat less than unity over a period of a few

money

quarters. This

more complete consumption function than that in our simple model
would highlight the difference between consumer expenditure and disposable

income as the scale variable in the money demand function. For example,
consumer expenditure also depends on expected future income. An anticipated

With these estimates and the further asuxxrptions that Cy = 0.7 and

held constant, the spending multiplier reaches a peak of 1.6 or 2.1, respec-

tively, after six quarters.5 In contrast, if the Fed holds the ney supply
constant (the experiment we consider), the spending multiplier begins at 0.7

and declines steadily to zero after three or four years. Thus, our parameter estimates appear a reasonable stylized approximation to this larger

tion, as in equation (2'), then the balanced budget multiplier is unity.
This value is, of course, larger than in the standard IS—LM model, in which
crowding out of investment implies a balanced budget multiplier less than

one. In our alternative model, there is no crowding out after a balanced
budget fiscal stimulus, since the increase in taxes reduces the demand for
money. This result also indicates that the full—employment deficit is an
inadequate measure of fiscal stimulus.

shift the LM curve in a contractionary direc—

t ion.
Third, our results suggest that policies to stimulate saving may

increase aggregate demand. Analytically, shocks to the consumption function, whether exogenous or induced by policy, have the same effects as per-

sonal tax cuts. Likewise, these results suggest that, in a world where the
money stock is held fixed, the paradox of thrift may not be a paradox at
all.

Fourth,

these results imply that tax cuts aimed at stimulating business

investment have very different effects on aggregate demand than tax cuts

aimed at stimulating consumer spending. Even if personal tax cuts are
contractionary, business tax cuts may nonetheless be expansionary, since

—10—

investment may generate less money demand than consumption.
Fifth, this analysis calls into question the efficacy of the tax

system as a stabilizer against shocks to aggregate demand. If, following a
positive shock to investment, automatic increases in tax collection further
stimulate aggregate demand, then the tax system exacerbates cyclical fluc-

tuations. More generally, whether the tax system acts as an automatic stabilizer or an automatic destabilizer may depend upon whether the monetary
authority is targeting interest rates or the money supply.
D. Extensions of the Model

The textbook IS—LM model that we consider above is designed only to
focus on the short—run impacts of alternative macro—economic policies.
Complicating the model along a variety of dimensions, however, would leave

the fundamental result unchanged. If money demand depends on consumer
spending more than other components of GNP, then a tax that stimulates consumer spending shifts the LM curve

that taking account of expectational effects reduces estimated fiscal policy

multipliers. This finding suggests that an explicit treatment of expec—
tatiorial effects would only strengthen our conclusions.

So far we have assumed that consumers treat government bonds as net

wealth so that tax cuts increase consumer expenditure. The qualitative
character of our results would be identical if the private sector treats

only a fraction of bonds as net wealth. If government bonds are not net

wealth at all, as Barro [l9T1 suggests, then tax cuts do not stimulate consumption and therefore shift neither the IS nor the LM curve. We believe,
however,

that there is ample

reason to doubt Barro's conclusion. The

existence of liquidity constraints, alternative models of the bequest motive

III. The Scale Variable in the Money Demand Function

The above discussion demonstrates the possibility that tax cuts are

contractionary. We nov address the empirical question of whether the
necessary condition for contractionary tax cuts is in fact satisfied.
Outside the stylized fantasylands of our models, there is no unambiguous a
priori

answer. The answer in large part

depends upon the parameters of the

demand function which, as Cooley and LeRoy [19811 point out, are at

of evidence, both econometric and

non—econometric,

Much work assumes that money is held primarily for transactions pur-

foundation for the theory of money, most work on this topic employs

money holding, which accounts for about two—thirds

of the total. He concludes [p. 7151 that "of the three transactions
variables, in the pre—197l period, GNP is clearly the worst, while consump-

and

tion

personal income are equally good." Both of these results from

disaggregate data suggest that tax cuts shift the 114 curve in a contrac—

tionary direction. If some part of money demand is a function

of consumer

expenditure, while the remainder is a function of total expenditure, then a
dollar of consumer expenditure generates more money demand than a dollar of
investment.
A second tradition views money demand as emerging out of a portfolio

allocation decision.

The essence of the portfolio view is that money demand

should depend on the level of wealth or permanent income. Friedman and
Schwartz [1982, p. 38] suggest in their chapter on monetary theory that

Income as measured by- statisticians may be a defective
index of wealth because it is subject to erratic
year—to-year fluctuations, and a longer—term concept,
like the concept of permanent income developed in
connection with the theory of consumption, may be
more useful.

The correct measure of total wealth is permanent after—tax income. In this
portfolio view, a tax cut reduces perceived wealth for any given level of

before—tax

income and thus shifts the LM curve

in

a contractionary direc-

tion.
Laidler [1977], in his comprehensive review of the money

demand

litera-

ture, concludes [pp. 139_1t81 that the evidence favors permanent income over

current income or non—hun wealth as the scale variable. Judd and

—15—

Scadding, in their recent survey paper [1982, p. 10081, write

that

"one of

the conclusions reached about the demand for money in the pre—1973 period
(mostly based on annual evidence) is that permanent income or wealth outperformed rrasured income in producing a stable money demand function." They
point out that subsequent work has shed only little new light on the relevant scale variable.

After reviewing monetary trends in the United States over the past

hundred years, Friedman and Schwartz [1982] also conclude that permanent
income

best explains the demand for money. If permanent income or total

wealth is the appropriate scale variable in the money demand function, then
economic theory suggests consumption as an

vable

ideal proxy for these unobser-

variables. Indeed, it has often been noted that the procyclical beha-

vior of the velocity of money is evidence for a permanent income view of
money demand, since the ratio of GNP to consumption is also strongly pro—
cyclical.

In summary,

neither

the transactions nor the portfolio view of money

demand points toward the use of current income as the scale variable. Both
theoretical and empirical considerations suggest the use of consumption in
the money demand function.

B. The Distribution of Money Holdings

Since the critical issue is the marginal propensity to hold money out
of different components of GNP, it is natural to inquire about the distribu-

tion of money holding.8 Table la presents some data on the ownership of the

to hold money rather than on the marginal propensities. The average propen—

both definitions of money, a very- large fraction is held by households.

This result is not entirely surprising. For at least two reasons, businesses are likely to be able to better economize on cash balances than

households. First, businesses are typically more sophisticated at financial
management than households. Second, economies of scale allow larger entities to hold less money relative to their size than small entities. Indeed,
theories of the transactions demand for money, such as Baumol 11952], Tobin

and

The results using information on M2 are even more striking. Only 1
percent of

holdings is allocated to investment, while 96 percent is allo-

cated to consumer expenditure. Following the same calculation as above, we
find that the propensity to hold money

out of

consumer expenditure is twenty

times the propensity to hold money out of investment.
Our theoretical discussion in Section II shows that the spending
multiplier may have a negative sign if government spending generates more

money demand than a weighted average of consumption and investment. Table
lb suggests that this result is unlikely, as relatively little money holding

is allocated to government spending. Moreover, all the money holding that
is allocated to G is by state and local governments; holdings by the federal

government are not included in the aggregates as currently defined.9 We

appears relatively stable.

Even if velocity measured with respect to nominal GNP is stable,
however, this fact does not imply that GNP is the correct quantity variable

in the quantity equation. Gross national product is only a proxy for total
transactions, and

another

variable may be a better proxy. Empirically,

velocity measured with respect to another variable may be even more stable

than velocity traditionally defined. In this section, we therefore compare
alternative velocity measures. In particular, we compare velocity measured

with

respect

respect

to gross national product (Y/M) to velocity measured with

to nominal consumer expenditure (c/M). Our goal is to find the

nominal aggregate that yields the most stable measure of velocity.10
We also examine velocity calculated using other plausible aggregates.

One possible scale variable for the quantity equation is personal disposable

income (Y—T). Equation (2') above suggests this formulation. For the
question

of

whether tax cuts are expansionary, disposable income is func-

tionally the same as consumption. For both formulations of money demand,

tax cuts shift the 124 curve in a contractionary direction. Another candidate variable is private spending (c+i). As expression (6) demonstrates,
the relevant parameters

for the determining for effect of a tax cut are

(L0) and the marginal

multipliers.
10We recognize that comparisons of the stability of velocity are just

comparisons of the goodness of fit of crude money demand equations. Below
we examine more standard money demand equations. We have two reasons for
examining velocity. First, it is an atheoretic approach which does not

require us to take a

the exogeneity of income or interest rates.

propensity to hold money out of investxnent (L1). We therefore directly com-

pare

the use of C to the use of C+I as the scale variable. The last aggre-

gate we examine is final sales, which is gross national product less

inventory investment. As Blinder [19811 documents, inventory fluctuations

are very large over the business cycle. One might thus suspect that a jor
difference between fluctuations in C and Y is attributable to inventory-

behavior. Moreover, since ny theories of money holding are based on the
transactions motive, final sales appears a more reasonable variable to

is no unambiguous way to measure the standard deviation of velo-

city. We therefore compute this standard deviation under a variety of

alternative assumptions. Velocity has historically trended upward, which
suggests

either detrending or first—differencirig the data. We compute the

standard

deviation both ways. We

detrend by regressing the log of velocity

on time and the square of time. For longer time periods, we also try
including the cube of time. The residuals from this regression are always
highly correlated, suggesting that the detrended series is possibly not sta-

tionary. As Plosser and Schwert [19781 suggest, examining the data after

first—differencing iy be preferred in this situation. Paralleling the
above equation, we regress the change in the log of velocity on time. The

Second, in examining velocity, it is more natural to allow the the influence
of lagged money on output, which similar lags are less natural in money

dend functions.
11Another plausible variable to examine in this context is domestic
absorbtion, defined as GNP less net exports. We do not examine it here
because it varies so little relative to GNP in U.S. historical data. We
return to the question of international effects in the concluding section.

trend is typically not significant in this regression and the residuals

are not highly correlated, indicating that velocity is well described as a
random walk.

It is widely believed that the money supply affects nominal GNP with a

lag. The relative success of the alternative nominal aggregates y be sensitive to this timing

issue.

We therefore also examine, for the more recent

data, velocity defined as the nominal aggregate divided by the money supply
lagged six months.

An examination of M2 velocity, also presented in Table 2a, suggests a

velocity.

For recent data, consumer expenditure appears the most

appropriate variable in the quantity equation.

As the period we

examine in Table a is

very long, we try

including the cube

of time to see whether this more general detrending affects the results. We
find that its inclusion alters no result. Since this longer period includes
both the Great Depression and World War II, it is not surprising that velocity is much more volatile than during the shorter post—war period.
The figures in Table 2b again do not confirm the traditional use of GNP

in the quantity equation. When we examine the standard deviation of velocity around its trend, we find that disposable income produces the most

stable velocity. When we examine the first difference of velocity, consumer
expenditure yields the most stable velocity.

In sum, our examination

of

the stability of velocity provides no sup-

port for using GNP in the quantity equation. Consumer expenditure (c)

most successful scale variable of the five we consider. Disposable

income (Y—T) appears in second place. Both of these two formulations of the
quantity equation imply that tax cuts are contractionary.

D. Money Demand Estimates

One can view the quantity equation as an extremely simple money demand
function in which the quantity elasticity is unity and the interest elasti-

city is zero. Under these restrictive assumptions, consumer expenditure

appears the best scale variable in the money demand function. It is natural

12Ag discussed in more detail below, there is more variation in the con—
sumption share of GNP in the period between 1930 and 1955 than in the period
since 1955. Examining the entire period necessitates using old M2, as it is
the only aggregate for which comparable data are readily available.

therefore turn to the direct estimation of ney demand functions.

In particular, we compare the standard formulation, in which real GNP is the
scale variable and the GNP deflator is the price level, to the alternative
formulation, in which

real

consumer spending is the scale variable and the

consumer expenditure deflator is the price level. We also compare the

then we obtain the other polar case in which consumer spending is the scale

variable. For intermediate values of the consumption weight, all components

We estimate equation (7)

using

non—linear least squares. In all the

regressions, we also include a time trend, as is standard. To correct for
serial correlation, we quasi—difference (7) and estimate the autoregressive

parameter (rho) simultaneously with the coefficients.1 The interest rate we
use is the commercial paper rate, although the use of other interest rate

series has no important effect on the results. All the other right hand
side variables are annual National Income Accounts series.
Tables 3a and 3b present the estimates of (7)

and M2, as currently defined, as the monetary aggregate. The first

column in both tables contains estimates in which the conventional model
based on gross national product (Y) is compared to the consumption—based

model. The value of the consumption weight is 0.76

for

Ml and 0.011

for M2.

The standard errors of these numbers, however, are about 0.5. These figures
indicate that neither polar hypothesis can be rejected. That is, we cannot
reject the conventional specification (A =

0).

We also cannot reject the

other extreme that money demand depends only on consumer expenditure (A =

1).

The reason for the recent data's inability to speak on this issue becomes apparent in Figure 2, which displays the ratio of nominal consumer

13We use annual data and do not use lagged dependent variables in an
attempt to avoid some of the statistical problems that plauge earlier work
on money demand. While the use of lagged dependent variables is standard in
money demand studies, we avoid them because of the difficulty in identifying
distributed lags in this way in the presence of serial correlation.
Quarterly money demand functions with distributed lags on the explanatory
variables are presented in the next section. For a discussion of this and
other problems, see Cooley and LeRoy f 19811 and Gordon [198I].

ll4Estlmatjng the equations in first—differenced form produces results
almost identical to those reported. This result is not surprising, as the
estimated value of the serial correlation correction is very high, indicating that uasi—differericing is close to first—differencing.

During the 1930s, 192405, and early 1950s, however, there is substantial

a natural experiment that my allow us to distinguish between our two
hypotheses.
The first column in Table 24a compares the consumption—based model to

the GNP—based model for

standard error of 0.13. We can reject the conventional specification (A =

0)

native (A = 1) at even the ten percent level. This regression provides
strong evidence that consumer expenditure generates more money demand than
other components of GNP.

When we use the longer sample period in Table 4a, the consumption weight is
always closer to one than to zero.

imiltiplier is negative, regardless of the scale variable in the money demand

function. In fact, the ex post real return on three month treasury bills
declined from 2.3 percent in 19614 to 2.1 percent in 1965 and to l. percent

in 1966. This fact indicates that monetary policy did even more than stabilize real rates in the period following the 19614 tax cut.

Okun also writes:

It

is reasonable to ask how much slower the overall economic advance might have been and how niich less expansionary
the tax cut would have been if monetary policy bad not been
accomodatirig. One could hypothesize an alternative monetary
policy which held the growth of bank reserves or the money
supply (or other liquidity variables) to some stated degree.
And one could then try to assess what difference this tighter
monetary policy would have made in the pace of the economic
advance. That would be an interesting statistical exercise.
It just does not happen to be the particular statistical
exercise which this paper attempts to perform.

Thus, the conventional conclusion that the 19614 tax cut bad a important

role in the subsequent expansion sheds no light on the question we address.

B. The Recent Episode

The tax cuts enacted in 1981 provide a better experiment to gauge the
sign

of the tax imiltiplier. The Federal Reserve was committed to

policy in the early 1980s than in the 1960g. On its

face, this

experience is not supportive of the conventional Keynesian doctrine.

might argue that

the tax cuts took time to have an effect, espe-

cially since the bulk of them took effect only in 1982 and 1983. The widely
accepted permanent income hypothesis, however, implies that their stimulative effect should occt,r as soon as they are announced. In fact, the con—

behavior of velocity during this period, however, was abnormal, and

this fact largely explains the collapse in aggregate demand. Velocity conventionally defined (Y/Ml) fell by 5.7 percent between the fourth quarter of

1981 and the fourth quarter of 1982. The historical average of the change
in velocity between 1961 and 1981 is a increase of 3.2 percent with a stan-

dard deviation of 1.7 percent. Thus, this large fall was by recent historical standards a very unusual event. An examination of M2 tells a similar
story. The average change in M2 velocity between 1961 and 1981 is about 0.2
percent, with a standard deviation of 2.5 percent. In 1982, however, it

fell by 6. percent. Again, the tall

in

velocity in 1982 was abnormal by

recent historical standards.

If we examine velocity defined using personal consumer expenditure, the

recession appears more normal. C/Ml fell from the fourth quarter of 1981 to
the fourth quarter of 1982 by only 1.1 percent, Although still large relative to the historical average increase of 3.0 percent, this drop is less

unusual than the 5.7 percent fall in Y/Ml. dM2 fell by 2.8 percent, which
is only slightly more than one standard deviation from the mean change of

zero and mich less that the 6.1 percent fall in Y/M2. With both monetary

aggregates,

the behavior of consumption velocity is more normal than the

behavior of velocity conventionally defined.

A similar conclusion applies to business tax increases.

Unlike personal tax increases, business taxes do not reduce the demand for
