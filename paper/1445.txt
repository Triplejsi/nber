The Use of Expected Future Variables in Macroeconometric Models

ABSTRACT

A more sophisticated expectational hypothesis than is tra—
ditionally used in the specification of macroeconometric models is

tested in this paper. Economic agents are assumed to use a vector

of variables Z in forming their expectations for periods t+l and
beyond. These expectations may or may not be rational in the Muth
sense. The results provide some evidence in favor of the more sophisticated hypothesis, but they are not strong enough to allow much weight to

be put on the hypothesis as yet. The evidence in favor of the hypothesis
is strongest for households' response to future wages and prices in their
consumption and labor supply decisions and for the Fed's response to
future inflation rates.

The sensitivity of the policy properties of my macroeconometric
model to the more sophisticated hypothesis is also examined in the paper.
The properties are not sensitive for a policy action in which government

expenditures are changed. They are somewhat sensitive for an action in
which personal tax rates are changed. In the latter case the properties
are also sensitive to whether or not the policy action is anticipated.

THE USE OF EXPECTED FUTURE VARIABLES IN MACROECONOMETRIC MODELS

by
Ray C. Fair

I. Introduction
It is common practice in traditional macroeconometric model build-

ing to use current and lagged values as proxies for expected future values.
It is well known that this procedure may not approximate well the way in

which expectations are actually formed. The purpose of this paper is to
consider an alternative procedure. Economic agents are assumed to use a

vector of variables Z in forming their expectations for periods t+l
and

beyond.

These expectations may or may not be rational in the Muth

sense.

If expectations are rational in the Nuth sense, the most efficient

estimation technique is full information maximum likelihood (FIML). This
technique accounts for the cross equation restrictions that are implied
by the rational expectations hypothesis, which is where most of the test-

able implications of the hypothesis lie. Unfortunately, the estimates are
expensive to compute. For nonlinear models the only known computational
method is the Fair-Taylor (1983) method, and this method is not currently
coniputationally feasible for large models.

There are limited information alternatives to FIML, and these are

1

2

the techniques used in this paper. These techniques are relatively inexpensive. They are also more robust than FINL in that unlike FIML they
retain their consistency when expectations are not rational. All they
require for consistency is that

be among the variables used by the

agents in forming their expectations. Agents can use variables other than

those in Z. .

Also,

the complete set of variables used by the agents need

not include all the predetermined variables in the model.

The two main limited information techniques are those of Hansen

(1982) and Hayashi and Sims (1983). The application of these methods to
the present problem is not completely straightforward, and so the exact
way in which these methods were used is explained in Section II.

In par-

ticular, some of the equations that are estimated in this paper have a
first order autoregressive error term (in addition to the moving average

error term that arises from the expectational assumptions), and the way
in which Hansen's method was set up to handle this problem needs to be explained.
The expectational hypothesis is tested in Section III using my U.S.

macroeconometric model (Fair (1984)). The basic version of this model
merely uses current and lagged values to proxy for expected future values.
The aim.of the work in Section III is to see if a more sophisticated ex-

pectational hypothesis leads to better results. Section IV examines the
sensitivity of the properties of the model to the alternative expecta-

tional hypothesis. The properties of the basic version of the model are
compared to the properties of the version of the model that uses the more

sophisticated hypothesis. Section V contains a brief conclusion.

error termthat is assumed to follow a first order autoregressive process.
It is easy to generalize the following discussion to have the model include
more than one expectational variable and include a higher order autore-

gressive process for the error term. Many structural equations in macroeconometric models have autoregressive errors, and this is the reason for

including (2) as part of the basic model. The length ahead parameter i
is assumed to be fixed. Again, it is easy to generalize the model to in-

clude more than one value of i for the same variable. The y and X
variables can be nonlinear transformations of endogenous and predetermined
variables, and so equation (1) can be nonlinear in variables.

Consider first the two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimation of equation (4).

Let Z be a vector of dimension k of first stage regressors.

A necessary condition for consistency is that Z and v be uncorrelated.

This will be true if both u and

The requirement that

t

and u be uncorrelated is the usual 2SLS require-

ment. The requirement that

and

be uncorrelated involves an

additional assumption, which is that the variables in Z have been used

(perhaps along with others) in forming the expectation of X2 . As
noted in the Introduction, this assumption does not require that the expec-

tations be rational. It merely requires that all the information contained

in the Z variables be used. Given this assumption (and the other standard assumptions that are necessary for consistency), the 2SLS estimator
of ct

in equation (4) is consistent. This estimator (denotes

McCallum (1976).

The standard formula for the covariance matrix of 2SLS is not

correct for i greater than 0 because in this case v IS serially

remain uncorrelated with all the current and past values of the variables

Hayashi and Sims (1983) show that without more information on the

is not in general possible to determine the rela-

are consistent under fairly general regularity conditions. Hayashi and
Sims show that consistency of their estimator is retained when the popula-

tion V is replaced with a consistent estimate and that consistency of
Hansen's estimator is retained when the population M is replaced with a
consistent estimate.

of the first stage regressors. A necessary condition for consistency is

that Z and v be uncorrelated, which means that Z must be uncorrelated with r

In

order to insure that

Z and t_2Ct+i_l are uncorrelated, Z must not include any variables
that were not known as of period t-2 .

This

is an important additional

restriction in the autoregressive case.2

2Cumby, Huizinga, and Obstfeld (1983), p. 341, incorrectly assert that
the instrument set must be moved backward in time as the order of the moving average process for v. increases and that higher order autoregressive

properties of u. can be handled merely by appropriate quasi differencing.
In fact, the instrument set must be moved backward in time as the order
of the autoregressive process increases. It need not be moved backward
as the order of the moving average process increases.

The estimator that is based on the minimizing of (15) is Amemiya's

(1974) nonlinear 2SLS estimator. In the general case (15) can be minimized
using a general purpose algorithm. In the particular case considered here
a simple iterative procedure can be used, where one iterates between esti—

mates of a and p .

suits in the following first-order conditions:

The possible application of the Hayashi—Sims estimator to the case

of an autoregressive structural error is not pursued here; only aH1R and

H2R have been used for the results in Section III.
As a final note on all the methods, one can iterate further than

Similarly, given ctHlR or H2R

be recomputed, and then (19) can be minimized for the new estimate of M
This whole process can also be repeated. This further way of iterating
has not been used for the results in this paper.

III. Tests of the Expectational Hypothesis
The
is

hypothesis that agents use Z in forming their expectations

tested in this section within the context of my macroeconometric model

(Fair

(1984)). The theory behind the model is that agents make decisions

by solving multiperiod optimization problems. Before solving these problems agents must form expectations of future values of a number of vari-

ables. The key decision variables for households are consumption and
leisure, and the key decision variables for firms are prices, wages, pro-

duction, investment, and employment demand. A typical estimated equation
in the econometric model has a decision variable on the left hand side and
variables that are assumed to affect the decision on the right hand side.
Current and lagged values of variables are used as proxies for expected

future values. The tests in this paper consist of adding future values
to the right hand side of these equations. Before discussing the tests,
however, the use of lagged dependent variables and the treatment of possible constraints on the decision variables in the model should be explained.

Use of Lagged Dpendent Variables
Lagged dependent variables are important explanatory variables in

the model. The use of these variables can be justified by appeal to the
simple partial adjustment model. Assume that equation (1) in Section II

holds with no error term and with y replacing y on the left hand

side, where y is the "desired" value of y .

Assume

that y only

partially adjusts to y each period, with adjustment coefficient y

Equation (23) is in a form that can be estimated. It is not possible to
identify

and 2 separately, but for many problems this is not impor-

tant.

It is well known that there is another justification for the use

of lagged dependent variables, which is that expectations are a geometric-

ally declining function of current and past values. Assume that

Equations (1) and (24) yield

xutl

Equation (25) differs from (23) in that it has a different error term and

it has X1 -

X11X

in place of X1. .

In

practice these two differences

are sometimes ignored, and one appeals rather casually to either the partial adjustment model or the model in which expectations are a geometrically declining function of current and past values as a justification for

using the lagged dependent variable as an explanatory variable. It should
be clear in the present case, however, that appeal must be made to the
partial adjustment model. The basic expectational hypothesis of this paper

13

will be tested by adding future values to equation (22). This procedure
is incompatible with the assumption that expectations are a geometrically
declining function of current and past values.

Treatment of Constraints

Expectations of individual agents in the model are not assumed to
be rational, and expectation errors can lead to situations of disequilib-

rium. The main form of disequilibrium is that households may be constrained
from working as much as they would like. This constraint was handled in
the following way in the empirical work. Consider as an example the con-

Let CSUNt denote the consumption

of services that the household sector would choose if it were not constrained

in how many hours it can work. CSIJNt is a function of the variables that
influence the households' optimization problems:

(26)

CSUNt

f(

where the variables in f are assumed to be observed. If the household

sector is not constrained, then CS equals CSUNt ,

and there is no

estimation problem. If the household sector is constrained, then CS.
is less than CSUN. if, as in the theoretical model, binding labor constraints cause the household sector to consume less than it would have

unconstrained. Now, if one can find a variable, say

(27)

CS. = CSUNt +

,

y

>

,

such that

0

then one has immediately from (26) and (27) an equation in observed vari-

ables. Given this setup, the problem for the empirical work is finding
a variable

for which the specification in (27) seems reasonable. The

14

variable Q should take on a value of zero when labor markets are tight
and households are not constrained and a value less than zero otherwise.

When the variable is less than zero, it should be a linear function of the

difference between the constrained and unconstrained decision values. For
the empirical work

was taken to be a particular nonlinear function of

a measure of labor market tightness.

Household Equations

Explanatory variables in the decision equations for the household
sector that are meant to be proxies for expected future values are:
1) the after-tax nominal wage rate, 2) the price level, 3) the after-tax
short-term or long-term interest rate, and 4) after-tax nonlabor income.
These variables enter the equations with either no lag or a lag of one

quarter, depending on which gave the better results. Other variables in
the equations include the initial value of wea1th, the labor constraint

variable, and the lagged dependent variable. The equations are estimated
by 2SLS, where the first stage regressors include the main predetermined

variables in the model.5 The tests in this paper consist of trying future
values of the relevant explanatory variables in place of the current or

lagged values. The variables used for Z are simply the first stage regressors used for the original estimates.6

The after-tax nominal wage rate and the price level are entered
separately •in the household equations. Since these variables are highly

5

See Fair (1984), Table 6-1, for the list of first stage regressors for
each equation. The number of first stage regressors per equation varies
from 34 to 43.
6The only exception to this is for equations in which the structural error
term follows a first order autoregressive process. In this case all oneperiod lagged endogenous variables were moved back one period.

15

collinear, it is not possible to include, say, the current value of each
variable and a future value of each variable in the equations together and

expect to get sensible results. What was done instead was simply to include each set of values (lagged, current, or future) separately and observe how the properties of the estimated equations change as different
values are included.

It is not clear in the present context how the estimated equations

should be compared. If the FIML technique could be used, one could merely
compare the likelihood values. For the limited information techniques,

however, there is no obvious measure of goodness of fit. The procedure
used in this paper is to compare the equations on the baiss of the tstatistics of the coefficient estimates of the variables in question. This
procedure is somewhat crude, but in most cases it should give a fairly good

idea of the explanatory importance of each variable. The results for the
household sector are summarized in Table 1.

All the equations in Table 1 except the 11'h equation have been

estimated by the H2 technique. The IHh equation has a first-order autoregressive structural error, and it has been estimated by the H2R technique.
The Hi and H1R techniques did not work in the sense that the estimates of

M were not positive definite. In no case with a moving average error of

order one or greater was M positive definite. On the other hand, no
computational problems were encountered in the use of H2 and H2R. In particular, the method discussed in Section II of computing H2R worked well.

For example, in the case of H2R applied to the 111h equation for the wage
and price variables led one period, the initial solution of equations (16)

and (17) required 13 iterations. The second solution (using C in place

of D in (16) and (17)) required 14 iterations.

level between successive estimates of p was .OO1.7
The data base used in Fair (1984a) was updated through 1984 I for

the results in this paper. The estimation period for all the equations
in Table 1 was 1954 I - 1983 I. The estimation period had to end four

quarters before the end of the data set because future values of up to

four quarters ahead were needed for the estimates in Table 1. It should
also be noted that the order of, the moving average process of the error
term was increased as the length ahead of the future values was increased.

For t+1 the order was one, for t+2 the order was two, and so on. For

t-l and t the order was zero.
The estimates using the HS technique were very close to the estimates using the H2 technique, and there seemed to be no need to present

both sets of results here. For example, the t÷l wage and price t-statistics for the CS equation were 1.45 and -1.23 for the HS estimator,

which compare to 1.30 and -1.08 in Table 1. For the CN equation the values
were 2.06 and -1.98, which compare to 2.12 and -2.04 in Table 1. The
t+4 wage and price t-statistics for the CD equation were 3.46 and -2.44,

which compare to 3.68 and -2.67 in Table 1. It seems clear that similar
conclusions would be drawn using either the H2 or HS technique, and so for
simplicity only the H2 results are presented here.

Consider first the wage and price results in Table 1. All equa-

tions except the IHh equation have better t-statistics for values led
one or more periods than for current or lagged values. An asterisk in
the table indicates my choice for the best lead for the equation. These

are the specifications that have been used for Version 2 of the model in

Section IV. The final pair of t-statistics for each equation in the table
is for a specification in which coefficients of certain lead values are

constrained to be equal. Except for the L3 equation, this specification
was not an improvement over the best individual lead value. The coeffi-

cient estimates for the IHh equation for t+l and beyond are not sensible
because they are of the wrong sign.

The interest rate results in Table 1 do not show any evidence that

future values are better than current or lagged values.8 The coefficient

estimates are of the wrong sign for t+3 and t+4 for the CS equation,
for all the leads for the CN equation, and for t+4 for the IHh equation.
Otherwise, the t-statistics for the future values are smaller in absolute

value than those for the current or lagged values. For the nonlabor income variable, only the results for the CN equation had a future value
better than a current or lagged value.

The wage and price results thus provide some evidence in favor of

the more sophisticated expectational hypothesis for households. One should
be careful, however, not to make too much of the results. In general the
results are fairly close across lags, current values, and leads, and in
some cases even the best results are not significant by conventional statistical standards.

8The wage and price explanatory variables that were used for the interest
rate regressions for the CS, CN, and CD equations are the ones indicated
by an asterisk in Table 1. For the IHh equation the t-l values of the
wage and price variables were used.

19

Firm Equations

There are six main estimated equations of the firm sector, explain-

ing: 1) the price level, 2) the wage rate, 3) production, 4) investment,
5) number of workers employed, and 6) number of hours worked per worker.
The price and wage equations have been extensively examined elsewhere (see
Fair (1984c)), and these equations will not be considered in this paper.
For the remaining four equations, the current value of sales appears in
the production equation as in part a proxy for expected future sales, and
current and lagged values of production appear in the investment, employment, and hours equations as in part proxies for expected future production.
For the tests in this paper future values of sales are added to the production equation and future values of production are added to the other three

equations. The results are summarized in Table 2.
The results for the firm sector provide no evidence in favor of the
more sophisticated expectational hypothesis. In the production equation
future values of sales are not significant in the three specifications

tried. In the investment equation the three future values of production
are significant when the coefficients are constrained to be equal, but the
coefficient estimates are of the wrong sign.

(The three lagged values of

production are marginally significant in the investment equation when their

coefficients are constrained to be equal.) In both the employment and
hours equations. the future values are not significant except for the two-

quarter-ahead value in the employment equation, which has a coefficient

estimate of the wrong sign. The results are thus uniformly negative for
the firm sector.

Term Structure and Stock Market Equations

There are two term structure equations in the model, one explaining

the bond rate and one explaining the mortgage rate. In both equations current and lagged values of the short-term interest rate are taken as proxies

for expected future values. (The three-month Treasury bill rate is used

as the short-term interest rate in the model.) For the tests in this paper
future values of the bill rate were added to these equations. The results
are summarized in Table 3.

In the bond rate and mortgage rate equations it is difficult to distinguish between the use of lagged values and future values of the bill

rate. In the bond rate equation the current and one-quarter-lagged values

are significant when they are included together in the equation. When the
lagged values are dropped and three future values are included, the current
value looses its significant and the first two future values are signifi-

cant. The specification that was chosen to be used for Version 2 of the
model is the one with the first three future values included. In the mortgage rate equation the current value is always significant, and the specification that was chosen for Version 2 is the one with the current value
and the first three future values included.9
In the stock price equation the current and one-period lagged values

91n earlier work (Fair (1979) and Chapter 11 in Fair (l984a)) I have experimented with a version of my model in which there are rational expectations
in the bond and stock markets. This work is different from the present
case in that in the earlier work the term structure and stock price equations were not estimated. In the case of the term structure equations,
for example, the expectations theory of the term structure of interest
rates was merely imposed on the model along with the assumption that expectations are rational in the Muth sense. In the present study the equations that have been used for Version 2 are all estimated equations.

The results of adding future values to this equation are also summarized

in Table 3. The results do not support the use of future values. The
future values have coefficient estimates of the wrong sign.

Interest Rate Reaction Function

The behavior of the Federal Reserve is explained by an interest rate

reaction function in the model. The left hand side variable is the bill

rate. The right hand side variables include:

I) the rate of inflation,

2) a measure of labor market tightness, 3) the rate of growth of real output, and 4) the lagged value of the rate of growth of the money supply.
The equation is a "leaning against the wind" equation in the sense that
as these four variables increase the Fed is estimated to allow short term

interest rates to increase. For the tests in this paper future values of
the rate of inflation, the measure of labor market tightness, and the rate

of growth of real output were tried in the equation. The results are summarized in Table 4.

The current values of the labor market tightness variable and the

real output growth variable gave the best results. For the labor market
tightness variable the t-statistics are lower for the future values, and
for the real growth variable the coefficient estimates are of the wrong

sign for values t+2 and beyond. For the inflation variable the future
values are better than the current value. The best results were obtained
using the first three future values with their coefficients constrained to

be equal (equation (8) in Table 4). This is the specification used for
Version 2 of the model. There is thus some evidence in favor of the more
sophisticated expectational hypothesis for the Fed's expectations of future

IV. Fiscal-Policy Effects in Two Versions of the Nodel
The results in Section III provide some support for the hypothesis

that agents use a vector Z of variables in forming their expectations
of future variable values. In particular, the results support this for
households' expectations of future wages and prices (and in one case of
future nonlabor income), for financial market participants' expectations
of future short term interest rates, and for the Fed's expectations of future

inflation rates. The purpose of this section is to examine the sensitivity
of fiscal-policy effects to the use of this expectational hypothesis. Two
versions of the model are considered. Version 1 is the basic version of
the model, where no future values are used as explanatory variables.U

'0In an earlier study (Fair (1984b)) using an earlier data set, I examined
the question whether Fed behavior is influenced by expected future federal
government deficits. A number of future values of the ratio of the federal government deficit to GNP were tried in the interest rate reaction function, and the best results were obtained using a lead of four quarters.
The equations were estimated by the H2 and HS methods. The coefficient estimate of the deficit variable was around 22.0, with a t-statistic of around
2.5 (see Table 1 in Fair (1984b)). With the updated data set used in this
study the best results were still obtained for a lead of four quarters,
but the coefficient estimate is now only 11.6, with a t-statistic of 1.27.
The results in the earlier study were highly tentative, and the current
estimates reinforce this. It is still too early to know how much, if
any, the Fed is influenced by expected future deficits. With respect to
the policy experiments in Fair (l984b), two values of the coefficient of
the deficit variable were used: the estimated coefficient of 21.9 and a
value half this size. Given the current estimate of 11.6, the second experiment seems more indicative of what might be the case. The deficit
variable has not been included in the interest rate reaction function for
the results in this study.

ll noted in Section III, the data base in Fair (1984a) has been updated
through 1984 I for the results in this paper. The estimation period for
Version 1 was 1954 I - 1984 I.

26

Version 2 uses the equations in Section III that have an asterisk beside

them. These equations consist of three consumer expenditure equations,
three labor supply equations, two term structure equations, and the inter-

est rate reaction function of the Fed. The remaining equations of Version
2 are the same as those of Version 1.

Four fiscal-policy experiments have been performed. The first two
are a sustained increase in federal government purchases of goods in real

terms GNP beginning in 1970 I. For experiment 1 the change is unanticipated
and for experiment 2 the change is anticipated as of 1968 I. The second
two experiments are a sustained decrease in the personal income tax rate

beginning in 1970 I. For experiment 3 the change is unanticipated, and
for experiment 4 the change is anticipated as of 1968 I. The results are

presented in Tables 5 and 6. The row 1 results are for Version 1. Since
this version is not forward looking, there is no difference between the

unanticipated and anticipated results. The numbers in row 2 are the unanticipated results for Version 2, and the numbers in row 3 are the anticipated results.

The calculation of the results in Tables 5 and 6 will first be

described, and then the results will he explained. The calculation of the
row 1 results is easy to describe. The actual residuals were first added
to all the estimated equations in the model and were taken to be exogenous.
(The actual residuals are the residuals that were computed at the time of

estimation.) This means that when the model is solved using the actual
values of the exogenous variables, a perfect tracking solution is obtained.
In other words, the ?tbaset values of the endogenous variables for the ex-

periment are merely the actual values. The policy variable was then changed
and the model was solved. The difference between the predicted value of

a variable from this solution and its actual value is the estimate of the
response of the variable to the policy change.

Version 2 has expected future variables on the right hand side of

some of the estimated equations. Two assumptions have been made for the
solution of this version. The first is that agents use my model in forming their expectations, and the second is that the expectations of the

exogenous variables in the model are equal to the actual values. These
two assumptions imply that agents' expectations of the future values are
equal to the model's predictions of them.
The numerical solution of Version 2 is more difficult than that of
Version 1 because of the existence of future variables among the explana-

tory variables. What this means is that future predicted values of the
endogenous variables affect current predicted values for Version 2, and
so the standard way of solving models period by period cannot be used.
One must instead iterate over solution paths of the endogenous variables.
The exact method for doing this is presented in Fair and Taylor (1983),
and this is the method that has been used for the row 2 and row 3 results.
Unlike the estimation method in Fair and Taylor (1983), which, as mentioned

in Section 1, is expensive, the solution method is fairly routine.12 A
perfect tracking solution for Version 2 was also obtained before the experiments were performed.
A final point about Version 2 should be noted before discussing the

results. Although the assumption has been made that the agents' expectations of various future values are equal to the model's predictions of
these values, the model is not a rational expectations model as this term

12The Fair-Parke program was also used for all the solution work in this
paper.

is sometimes used. Within the context of the model the expectations are
rational in the Muth sense, but there is nothing in the model, for example,

that precludes there from being disequilibrium in the labor market. The
labor constraint discussed in Section III can be binding on the household

sector. The model is not an equilibrium model even though agents' expectations of some of the variables in the model are rational in the specific
sense of Muth.

Consider first the results in Table 5. The main feature of these
results is that the values in the three rows are quite close to each other.

The main reasons for this are the following. (1) Although the Version 2
interest rate reaction function has the Fed responding to expected future
inflation rates one, two, and three quarters out rather than in the current quarter only, it also has smaller estimated coefficients for the labor

market tightness variable and the real output growth variable.13 The net
effect of this is that the bill rate increases in row 1 are slightly higher

than those in rows 2 and 3. In other words, the Fed leans slightly more
against the wind for Version 1 than it does for Version 2.
(2) Although the bond rate and mortgage rate predictions for Version
2 are a function of the bill rate predictions one, two, and three quarters
out, the sum of the coefficient estimates across the three quarters is not

that large (see Table 3). The net effect is for the bond rate and mortgage rate increases for Version 2 to be about the same as those for Version 1.

(3) Interest rates have an important effect on consumer expenditures
in both versions of the model, but given that the interest rate increases
13

.
Equation (8) in Table 4 has a labor market tightness coefficient of .027

and a real growth coefficient of .052. For the Version 1 equation these
two coefficients are .035 and .065.

31

are about the same for the two versions, there are no large differences

in effects here. This means that the main differences for consumption,
if any, must come from the different responses to prices and wages. It
can be seen from the results for the GNP deflator and the after-tax nominal wage, however, that the increases in these two variables are about
the same, especially for the first few quarters after the policy change.
Since households respond primarily to the difference between the two variables, the effects from price and wage changes for this experiment are

small. It is true for nondurable and durable consumption that the increases
are larger (or the decreases smaller) for Version 2 than for Version 1,
but this is primarily due to the fact that interest rates are slightly
lower for Version 2 than for Version 1.

The slightly larger nondurable and durable consumption predictions
for Version 2 lead to slightly larger increases in real GNP for Version

2. This in turn leads to slightly larger increases in the GNP deflator
for Version 2. The labor supply responses are about the same in the two
versions because of the small changes in the real wage, and so the unemployment decreases are about the same.
It makes little difference for Version 2 whether or not the policy

change is anticipated. In the anticipated case the bill rate is slightly
higher two quarters before the change because of the expected future in-

flation. The bond rate is slightly higher one quarter before the change
and the mortgage rate is slightly higher one, two, and three quarters be-

fore the change because of the higher future bill rates. These higher
interest rates lead to GNP being slightly lower before the change. This
in turn leads to the GNP deflator being slightly lower and the unemployment

rate being slightly higher. The changes before the policy changes are,

32

however, quite small.

Consider now the results in Table 6. When the personal income tax
rate is decreased, this has a direct positive effect on the after-tax nomi-

nal wage. This is thus one of the best experiments for seeing the differences between the two versions of the model because one of the main differences between them is the households' response to after-tax real wage

changes. Comparing the increases in the GNP deflator in Table 6 with those
in the after-tax nominal wage, it can be seen that the present experiment

corresponds to a large increase in the after—tax real wage. The initial
increases for consumer expenditures are larger for Version 2 because of

the positive households response to the future real wage increases. This
leads to higher initial increases in GNP for Version 2. The interest rate
differences are again small for this experiment, and the main differences

in effects come from the real wage effects. In this experiment there is
also more of a difference between the unanticipated and anticipated results

for Version 2. There is more initial expansion for the anticipated results
because of the positive response of the households to the future wage increases.

Labor supply in both versions of the model responds positively to

real wage increases. This, other things being equal, has a positive effect
on the unemployment rate. For the experiment in Table 6 the positive effect
dominates in that the unemployment rate changes are positive rather than

negative in all three cases. The unemployment rate results are quite close
between Versions 1 and 2. The positive real wage response is larger for
Version 2, but Version 2 also has more output response, which has a nega-

tive effect on the unemployment rate. The net effect is that the changes
in the unemployment rate are about the same for the two versions.

V.

Conclusion

This study has demonstrated that it is possible with the limited
information estimation techniques discussed in Section II and the solution
method applied in Section IV to use a more sophisticated expectational
hypothesis than has traditionally been done in the specification of large-

scale macroeconometric models. Although this is now possible, the results
in this paper to some extent leave open the question whether it is neces-

sary. The evidence in favor of the more sophisticated expectational hypothesis is strongest for households' response to wages and prices in their

consumption and labor supply decisions. No evidence in favor of the hypoth-

esis for firms could be found. The term structure results are about the
same whether lags or future values are used. There is some evidence that

the Fed responds to future inflation rates. It is clear that a stronger
set of results would need to be found before one could put much weight on
the hypothesis.

The results in Section IV are interesting in that they show that
the policy responses in a model like mine are not necessarily sensitive

to the use of the more sophisticated expectational hypothesis. The results
in Table 5 are very close. The differences are larger in Table 6, and it
is clear for this policy change that it makes a difference which version
of the model one believes and whether or not one assumes that the
change is anticipated.
