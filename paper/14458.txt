ABSTRACT
Using the Census Bureau's internal March Current Population Surveys (CPS) file, we construct and
make available variances and cell means for all topcoded income values in the public-use version of
these data. We then provide a procedure that allows researchers with access only to the public-use
March CPS data to take advantage of this added information when imputing its topcoded income values.
As an example of its value we show how our new procedure improves on existing imputation methods
in the labor earnings inequality literature.

Introduction
For confidentiality reasons, the Census Bureau topcodes all values above some maximum
for each income source in the public-use version of the March Current Population Survey (CPS).
Since 1996, the Census Bureau has provided the cell mean of all topcoded incomes reported for
at least some of these income sources, including the four income sources related to labor
earnings.1
With these cell means, researchers using the public-use CPS can match the mean values
found using internal CPS data for these income sources.

Most researchers interested in

measuring long-term trends in earnings including years prior to 1996, however, have imputed
their own topcode values to create a consistent series. A common practice is to impute topcoded
earnings as a fixed multiple above the topcode point, although there is little consensus on the
appropriate multiple to use. For example, Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1993) impute weekly wages
and salaries for workers with topcoded earnings at 133% of their topcoded value using 1963–
1989 public-use CPS data and ignored changes over time in the proportion of the weekly wages
and salaries distribution affected by the topcode rule. Lemieux (2006) multiplies topcoded hourly
wages and salaries by a factor 1.4 using the public-use CPS, while Autor, Katz, and Kearney
(2008) and Katz and Murphy (1992) multiply topcoded weekly wages and salaries by a factor of
1.5.2
In order to further alleviate concerns about topcoding, many researchers who impute
topcoded wages as a fixed multiple above the topcode point also focus on the P90/P10 ratio
rather than inequality statistics such as the Gini coefficient or the Theil index which incorporate
information about the full distribution of wages and salaries. However, Burkhauser, Feng, and
Jenkins (2007) demonstrate that while the P90/P10 ratios for both wages and salaries and total

2

labor earnings are not greatly impacted by topcoding, the trends using the P90/P10 ratio are
different than those found using the Gini coefficient. Thus, a more precise topcode correction
method would allow for a further analysis of inequality trends using inequality statistics that
encompass more of the earnings distribution than the P90/P10 ratio.
Fichtenbaum and Shahidi (1988) use a slightly more sophisticated topcode correction
method, setting all values above the topcode threshold in the public-use CPS to a single value
such that the distribution of annual wages and salaries above the median best fits the Pareto
distribution. Bernstein and Mishel (1997) use a similar approach, but fit the entire distribution of
hourly wages and salaries to the Pareto distribution instead of just the upper half of the
distribution. As a result, if the distribution of wages and salaries shifts to the right, then the
imputed value for topcoded wages and salaries will increase even if the topcode threshold is
unchanged. Bernstein and Mishel note that such a Pareto imputation for topcoded values in
public-use CPS is not perfect, as it involves imputing one value for all top-coded wages and
salaries but they argue that it is better than ignoring topcodes altogether. See Angle and Tolbert
(1999) for a further discussion of using a Pareto distribution to impute a single value for
topcoded wage and salaries .
With access to internal CPS data used by the Census Bureau in their official estimations
of income and its distribution,3 we have constructed and disseminate cell means for the years
1976-2002 (Larrimore, Burkhauser, Feng and Zayatz, 2008).4 With these cell means researchers
who previously assigned all topcoded earnings values an estimate of the mean of all of those
earnings values above the topcode threshold can now assign these individuals their mean values
above the threshold based on the internal data. However, this approach is still limited because it
assumes all individuals with a topcoded earnings value have the identical earnings value for that

3

type of earnings.
A potential remedy for the problem of assigning all individuals with topcoded earnings
the same value is to assume that topcoded earnings fit the Pareto distribution. It is then possible
to use a multiple imputation approach to assign earnings to topcoded individuals such that the
distribution of their earnings both fit the Pareto distribution and has a mean that matches the cell
means in the internal data.
While this approach is consistent with the common assumption that the earnings
distribution roughly follows a Pareto distribution, we believe one can do even better than Pareto
when matching earnings to those seen in the internal CPS data. In this paper, we construct and
disseminate the variances of each cell for topcoded incomes in the public-use March CPS. This
information can be used together with our cell means to further improve estimates at the top of
the income distribution. While the Pareto distribution is convenient since it can be fitted using
only the mean earnings above the topcode, it is not flexible enough to also match a known
variance. Therefore, we instead assume that earnings above the topcode threshold fit a Stoppa
distribution, which is a generalization of the Pareto distribution (Stoppa, 1990). Using a multiple
imputation approach to fit topcoded labor earnings to the Stoppa distribution fitted around the
mean and variance of topcoded labor earnings, we find that one can very closely match the
distribution of labor earnings found in the internal CPS data. While we focus on the broadest
definition of labor earnings, which includes income from primary earnings, wages and salaries,
self-employment, and farm earnings, similar results are obtained when focusing on the narrower
category of only income from wages and salaries.
In the following section we briefly explain how we calculate the cell means and variances
using the internal CPS data. We then demonstrate that the log variance of labor earnings found

4

using a multiple imputation procedure based on public-use CPS data with our cell mean and
variance data better matches the log variance using the internal CPS than other methods used in
the literature. While we focus on the log variance of labor earnings, such an imputations
procedure could similarly be used to obtain more accurate values of other statistics of interest
such as the Gini Coefficient or could be applied to other definitions of income including earnings
from wages and salaries or total household income including non-labor income. More generally,
any researcher using the public-use CPS data can now use these newly available variance data to
improve their imputations of topcoded incomes.
Cell Means and Variances for Topcoded Incomes
In calculating the cell mean and variance for each source of topcoded income in the
public-use March CPS from 1976-2004, we attempted to remain consistent with the procedures
used by the Census Bureau to provide its cell means in recent years. Since topcoding in the
public-use CPS occurs for each separate income source, we calculated cell means and variances
for each source of income separately—11 prior to 1988 and 24 since then. Also mirroring
Census Bureau practices, our results are the weighted mean and variance of the income of all
individuals above the topcode value for the income source.
While, in general, cell means and variances are reported separately for each income
source, for confidentiality reasons cell means were combined when less than 5 individuals are
topcoded from a source of income. In these instances, we combined 2 or more income sources to
achieve a group of at least 5 individuals and then provide the mean and variance of topcoded
incomes from this combined cell. This is the same procedure for handling small cells used by
the Census Bureau in the cell means they have released in recent years (Census Bureau, 2007a).
See Larrimore, Burkhauser, Feng, and Zayatz (2008) for a more detailed discussion of the

5

creation of the cell mean series and the procedures for protecting the confidentiality of
respondents. For ease of presentation of the variance data, we took the square-root of the
variance and provide the standard deviations instead. The means of topcoded incomes for each
income source are provided in Appendix Tables 1 and 2 and the standard deviations are reported
in Appendix Tables 3 and 4.
For those interested in more details about specific demographic groups, for each source
of labor earnings we also provide cell means and variances divided by race, gender, and
employment status. These are the same demographic groups used by the Census Bureau in the
cell means they have released in recent years. For these demographic-based cell means, the cell
mean is the weighted mean earnings from each of these sources of labor earnings for topcoded
individuals with the specified demographic characteristics. As was the case for the standard cell
means, if less than 5 individuals within a demographic group are topcoded on a source of labor
earnings then for confidentiality reasons those individuals are combined with other demographic
groups to ensure that at least 5 people are included in the cell mean calculation. The means of
topcoded values for each source of labor earnings for each demographic group are provided in
Appendix Tables 5 through 11 and their standard deviations are reported in Appendix Tables 12
through 18.
Imputation Using Both Cell Means and Variances
Using the cell means and variances reported above, it is possible to improve on previous
methods of imputing topcoded earning values as a fixed multiple above the topcode threshold or
of assigning all topcoded individuals the cell mean as their imputed earnings. Since these
methods assign all topcoded individuals the same level of earnings income, they implicitly
assume no variance in topcoded earnings. This causes calculations of the variance of earnings

6

for the entire population to be understated.
In order to improve estimates of topcoded earnings by using the variance and cell mean
information from internal data, we assume that the labor earnings distribution fits the Stoppa
distribution, which is a generalization of the Pareto distribution. The Stoppa distribution has a
cumulative distribution function:

where y0 is a lower bound of the distribution, in this case representing the topcode threshold, and
the parameters α and θ specify the shape of the distribution. The Pareto distribution is the special
case of the Stoppa distribution where θ equals 1.
While the Pareto distribution is often considered a good fit for the US income distribution
(Piketty and Saez 2003), and has commonly been used to determine fixed-values to impute
topcoded wages and salaries (see Fichtenbaum and Shahidi, 1988; Bishop, Chiou, and Formby,
1994; and Bernstein and Mishel, 1997), it is not flexible enough to incorporate known
information about the variance of the distribution. As a result, while one could use the Pareto
distribution to impute varying earnings for individuals above the topcode threshold, even when
setting the mean of the imputed earnings correctly, such an imputation will generally estimate the
variance incorrectly.
By using the more general Stoppa distribution, we can improve on imputations using the
Pareto distribution. Because it is a two-parameter distribution, we can use the Stoppa distribution
to incorporate the known information about both the mean and variance of topcoded incomes.
Thus, instead of assuming that the variance of topcoded labor earnings fits the standard variance
of the Pareto distribution, the Stoppa distribution allows us to ensure that the variance of
topcoded labor earnings in our imputations match the variance in the internal CPS data.

7

Before imputing topcoded values, we must first calculate α and θ for each of the four
sources of labor earnings (primary earnings, wages and salary, self-employment, and farm
earnings) in each year such that the mean and variance of topcoded values based on the Stoppa
distribution will match those seen in the internal CPS data. 1 This is done by solving for α and θ
that simultaneously solve both of the first two moments of the Stoppa distribution:

where m and v are the mean and variance of the distribution and

and

are beta functions.2
Because of natural shifts in the distribution above the topcode threshold, the parameter
values for the Stoppa distribution differ from year to year and across labor earnings sources.
However, some of the largest changes, such as the shift from 1981 to 1982, coincide with
changes to the topcode threshold in the public-use data. This is to be expected since any change
to the topcode threshold can dramatically alter the mean and variance of topcoded values.
Because the parameter values change over time both due to natural fluctuations in the topcoded
population and changes in the topcode thresholds, when imputing topcoded values we use
different parameter values for each year and earnings source in order to provide the best fit to
internal data. These parameter values for the four sources of income that make up labor earnings
are provided in Table 1.3
Having determined the appropriate parameters in the Stoppa distribution, we can proceed
with imputing each source of topcoded labor earnings. First, for each of the four sources of labor
earnings (three sources prior to 1988), we find all its topcoded observation and then for each of

8

these observations we draw a value from the distribution that is implied by the fitted Stoppa
distribution. For observations that are not topcoded, no imputation is required so we simply use
the earnings as reported in the public-use CPS data. Second, we sum the four sources of labor
earnings, to calculate the total labor earnings in our distribution for all individuals in each year.
We estimate our inequality statistics using this distribution which includes imputed labor
earnings for topcoded observations and observed labor earnings for non-topcoded observations.
Third, we repeat steps 1 and 2 one hundred times, and finally, we average the one hundred
estimates in each year to generate the reported inequality statistics.
Comparing the log variance of labor earnings using different topcode corrections
In Figure 1, we compare the trends in the log variance of labor earnings in the public-use
March CPS using our multiply imputed data based on the Stoppa distribution (Public-Stoppa) to
those obtained using four other methods of correcting for censoring in the public-use CPS data.
These methods include ignoring cell means and assigning the topcode value as the labor earnings
for all topcoded individuals (Public-NoCM), assigning a value equal to 1.4 times the topcode
threshold to topcoded individuals (Public-Multiple),8 assigning the cell mean value as the
earnings for all topcoded individuals (Public-CM), and using our multiple imputation approach
but fitting topcoded values to the Pareto distribution instead of the Stoppa distribution (PublicPareto). Finally, we also include the log variance of labor earnings values found in the actual
internal data (Internal).
We find that in all years except 1985 (the only year the public-use top code values were
identical to the censoring threshold of the internal CPS data) the Public-NoCM series understates
the log variance of labor earnings in the internal CPS compared to each of the other series. This
should not come as a surprise since this series will suppress the values of top labor earners, thus

9

compressing the labor earnings distribution and reducing the labor earnings variance.
The log variance found in the Public-Multiple series is higher than that found in the
Public-NoCM series because it allows for greater labor earnings at the top of the labor earnings
distribution. Prior to 1994, this series does a reasonable job of approximating the log variance of
labor earnings seen in the internal data. However, after 1994 when the Census increased the
censoring levels in their internal data the Public-Multiple series greatly understates the amount of
labor earnings held by top labor earners and as a result also understates the log variance of labor
earnings. Using this procedure to match the level of labor earnings received by topcoded
individuals in the internal data would require imputing topcoded sources of labor earnings at
approximately twice the topcode threshold instead of 1.4 times the threshold. However, even
with a more accurate multiple for estimating topcoded sources of labor earnings, this method
would still understate the log variance of labor earnings because there is no variance in the
imputed labor earnings for topcoded individuals.
Using cell means to impute topcoded values further improves the estimates of the log
variance of labor earnings since, unlike the Public-NoCM and Public-Multiple series, the PublicCM series does not assign topcoded individuals an arbitrary level of earnings. It assigns them
the actual mean labor earnings seen in the internal CPS data. However, as was the case with the
Public-Multiple series, even with the most accurate estimate of the level of earnings received by
topcoded individuals the log variance of labor earnings will be understated compared to the
actual log variance seen in the internal CPS data because it assumes that all topcoded individuals
have the same earnings.
To further improve approximations of the log variance found in the internal CPS data, it
is necessary to drop the restrictive assumption that all individuals with a topcode for some source

10

of earnings have the same earnings values for that source of labor earnings. Prior to the
availability of cell means and variances for earnings above the topcode threshold for each
sources of labor earnings, the best approximation, not assuming that all topcoded individuals
have the same value, was the Public-Pareto series. This series assumes topcoded earnings values
fit the Pareto distribution fitted so that the mean of the distribution matches the cell mean of
topcoded income sources. However, since the variance of the Pareto distribution is greater than
the observed variance of topcoded labor earnings, we find that this approach greatly overstates
the log variance of labor earnings in the internal CPS data. In fact, for many years the PublicPareto series misses the log variance of labor earnings in the internal data by even more than the
Public-CM series.
The Public-Stoppa series, which uses our multiple imputation approach to fit topcoded
values for each sources of labor earnings to the Stoppa distribution with a mean and variance for
topcoded labor earnings that matches the mean and variance of topcoded labor earnings in the
internal CPS data, provides a much better fit to the log variance of labor earnings seen in the
internal CPS data. Since this series does not assume that all individuals topcoded for a given
source of labor earnings have the same earnings from that source, it accurately finds a higher
variance than each series that make this assumption. And since it fits the variance of topcoded
labor earnings to the actual variance in the internal CPS data, it provides a much better fit to the
true distribution of labor earnings above the topcode in the internal CPS data than the PublicPareto series which relies on the assumption that the variance of topcoded earnings matches the
variance of the Pareto distribution.9
Conclusions
Topcoding in the public-use CPS data has limited the ability of researchers to incorporate

11

high earners in estimates of the US earnings inequality. This problem is exacerbated by nonsystematic changes in topcoding over time, causing inaccuracies in trends observed based on this
data. Using internal CPS data, we have created a series of cell means and variances for topcoded
income which can be used in conjunction with public-use CPS data to generate more accurate
estimates of US income levels and trends. When using the cell means and variance to impute
topcoded labor earnings in the public-use CPS we found that the log variance of labor earnings is
greater than is observed when ignoring topcodes or when using cell means alone and less than
that found assuming a Pareto distribution. It much more closely mirrors the actual log variance of
labor earnings using the internal CPS data than these other approximations.
Because some censoring exists in the internal March CPS data, results based on these
statistics will still omit the very top earners whose labor earnings are above both the public-use
topcode and the internal thresholds.

For researchers interested in these earners, who are

generally confined well within the top 1% of the income distribution, it is necessary to make
additional out-of-sample predictions about the distribution of labor earnings above the internal
censoring points (for an example of such an out-of-sample estimation, see Burkhauser, Feng,
Jenkins and Larrimore, 2008). For researchers limited to using the public-use CPS, who wish to
avoid the additional distributional assumptions required for such out-of-sample predictions,
using variance and cell means of topcoded incomes that we provide will yield the best estimates
of the US earnings and income distribution that can be made without making out of sample
predictions on incomes above the internal censoring points.

A

– Primary Earnings were not reported as a separate category prior to 1988. All labor earnings were allocated separately
to wage, self-employment, or farm-earnings.
B
– Indicates that the public-use topcode was identical to the internal topcode, so the value in the public-use data matches
the value in the internal data without the use of the imputations procedure.

A

- Indicates that there are not enough observations to report a cell mean for this population group in this year. The reported standard deviation is a combined
standard deviation with the other footnoted population groups in the same year.
B
- Indicates that the internal censoring point is identical to the public cell mean so no additional information can be obtained from the internal data
C
- Indicates that there are not enough individuals topcoded for INCSI2 to report a cell mean in this year, so the standard deviation reported is a combined
standard deviation for INCSI1 and INCSI2
D
- Indicates that there are not enough individuals topcoded for INCDS2 to report a cell mean in this year, so the standard deviation reported is a combined
standard deviation for INCDS1 and INCDS2
N/A – Indicates that no individual with these demographic characteristics were topcoded in this year from the specified income source
Note: In parentheses below each variable name is the mnemonic for the income source from the March Current Population Survey Technical Documentation.

A

- Indicates that there are not enough observations to report a cell mean for this population group in this year. The reported standard deviation is the standard
deviation for the combined cell mean with the other footnoted population groups in the same year.
B
- Indicates that the internal censoring point is identical to the public cell mean so no additional information can be obtained from the internal data.
N/A – Indicates that no individual with these demographic characteristics were topcoded in this year from the specified income source

Labor earnings include income from: primary earnings, wages and salaries, self-employment, and farm-earnings

sources. This is a slightly broader definition of earnings than income from primary earnings and wages and salaries that
is most commonly used in the literature.
2

Although researchers have explored hourly, weekly, and annual wage inequality using March CPS data, all of these

measures of wages are based on respondents reported annual income from wages and salaries. Wage earnings are then
rescaled to a weekly or hourly basis by dividing annual income from wages and salaries by the weeks or hours worked
over the course of a year.
3

Each year the Census Bureau uses the internal March CPS data to produce its official statistics on the average income

and poverty rates (U.S. Census Bureau, 2007b). These official values are based on the internal March CPS data that is
not available, except under certain conditions, to researchers outside of the Census Bureau.
4

Each CPS survey captures income from the previous year. In this paper all references are to the survey year, so when

we discuss the year 1976, this refers to income from various sources that members of the household received in 1975
reported on the March 1976 Current Population Survey.
5

In the analysis of the log variance of earnings, we use the cell means and variances for all individuals from each source

of topcoded labor earnings without dividing the sample by demographic information. This provides more stable
parameter estimates, since the small number of topcoded individuals in some demographic groups would lead to large
fluctuations in these estimates.
6

Because of the complexity of these equations, an analytical solution does not exist to solve the simultaneous equations.

Instead, the solution to the moment equations were calculated using a constrained minimization problem, setting the first
moment equation as a constraint and finding α and θ that minimize the square of the second moment equation with the
additional constraint that both α and θ are in the positive domain. To ensure that the solution found through the
constrained minimization problem solves both moment conditions and is not simply the best available solution given the
constraints, a similar minimization was repeated using the second moment as the constraint and minimizing the square of
the first moment equation.

In all years, we found identical solutions of α and θ when performing the second

minimization problem.
7

Since the Pareto distribution is a special case of the Stoppa distribution, it is easy to test whether the Pareto assumption

that the θ parameter equals 1. Unfortunately, due to the relatively small number of topcoded individuals from labor

37

earnings sources in some years, for confidentiality reasons on the internal data we are unable to release the variancecovariance matrices that would be required to produce standard errors for our cell means and variances in order to test
whether the Pareto assumption is satisfied in specific years.
8

In creating the Public-Multiple series, we followed an approach similar to that used by Lemieux (2006). For self-

employment and farm earnings in all years, we assign topcoded individuals earnings from that source equal to 1.4 times
the topcode threshold. For wages, prior to 1988, topcoded individuals for each source of income are assigned 1.4 times
the topcode threshold. After the 1988 Census redesign, we follow Lemieux’s approach and assume that all primary labor
earnings are from wages and salaries and thus combines the primary labor earnings and secondary earnings from wages
and salaries. From 1988 to 1995 individuals with combined wages greater than 99,999 from the two sources are
considered topcoded and assigned a value of 1.4 times the topcode threshold of 99,999. Starting in 1996, individuals
with combined wages greater than 150,000 from the two sources, which is the topcode threshold for primary labor
earnings, are considered topcoded and assigned a value of 1.4 times the topcode threshold of 150,000.
9

Note that while imputing topcoded values using the cell means and variances allows us to better match measures of

earnings and income inequality using the public-use CPS to results found when using the internal CPS data, these
methods are limited in detecting the true levels of US inequality because the internal CPS data is also subject to a degree
of censoring. The internal censoring points are generally much higher and more stable over time than the public-use
topcodes, but this censoring means that the very top values will still not be captured. Additionally, a substantial increase
in internal censoring points in 1994 leads to a trend break in that year for any series based on the internal CPS. Despite
these limitations, since this is the same data used to produce official Census Bureau statistics, these remaining censorship
problems for users of the variance and cell mean data in conjunction with the public-use March CPS data are no worse
than those in the data used by the Census Bureau to produce its official statistics with the internal March CPS.
