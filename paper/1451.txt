September 1984

Financial Intermediation in the United States

ABSTRACT
The principal rationales that give rise to financial intermediation
are benefits of size and specialization, the diversification of specific
asset risks, and the pooling of even broader classes of risk. Each is a
significant factor in accounting for the U.S. economy's reliance on intermediation.
In addition, since World War II a further important factor has been the
economy's continual shift away from government debt toward the debt of
private nonfinancial entities including individuals and businesses. Nonfinancial
investors (primarily individuals) have exhibited a strong preference for

holding the debt of these nonfinancial borrowers via financial intermediaries

rather than directly.

As the U.S. economy's reliance on financial intermediaries overall has
increased during the post—war period, some specific kinds of intermediary
institutions have grown more rapidly than others. Commercial banks have about

held their

own in relative terms, while steadily shifting their basic
business back toward lending activities and away from securities investments.
NDnbank deposit intermediaries have grown in relation to overall economic
and financial activity, as the growth of savings and loan associations has
more than offset the (relative) decline of mutual savings banks. Among
private nondeposit intermediaries, life insurance companies have declined
in relative terms while both public and private sector pension funds have

shown exceptionally rapid growth. Finally, the federal government's participation
in the financial intermediation process in the United States has also
increased rapidly during these years, in part as a result of the pressures
created bj the economy's shift to private instead of government debt.

FINANCIAI INTERMEDIATION IN THE UNITED STATES*

Benjamin M. Friedman

Harvard University

The intermediating function provided by specialized institutions
has always been a hallmark of well developed financial markets. In the
modern economy almost everyone participates in the financial markets, and

few economic events take place without their financial counterpart. The
basic role of the financial markets is to enable millions of businesses
and individuals to carry out, more easily and more

efficiently, the inter-

actions that their activities in the nonfinancial economy entail. Although
in

principle businesses and

dealings

individuals could carry

out their financial

directly, without the advantages of intermediary services,

in most cases doing so would be inconsistent with the underlying reason

for having and using financial markets in the first place. Intermediation
renders financial transactions more efficient, and therefore increases
the use that both businesses and individuals make of financial markets.
In addition, in some instances financial intermediaries enable market
participants to achieve objectives that would be unattainable in their
absence.

This important role played by financial intermediation is typically

not

static. Throughout their history financial markets have undergone

a shift — away from direct transactions between nonfinancial borrowers and
lenders,

toward the intervention of financial intermediaries. In

the

United States the development of the commercial banking system and of the

life insurance industry in earlier years, and more recently the great
expansion of nonbank deposit institutions and both private and public

—2—

sector pension funds, have been important features of the development of
the U.S. financial system. In addition, the roles played even by specific
intermediary institutions change over time. The shifting requirements
of the nonfinancial economy, the evolution of new communications and
information processing technologies, changes in government regulations,
and even independent financial innovations, all play a part in this dynamic
process.

The goal of this chapter is to examine the structure of financial
intermediation in the United States, both as it exists today and as it has

evolved in the years since World War 11.1 The primary focus is on the
role played by intermediation in general, and by specific kinds of intermediaries in particular, in fulfilling the financial markets' basic purpose
of serving the needs of the nonfinancial economy.

Section 1 notes explicitly several of the main rationales underlying

the use of financial intermediation. Section 2 relates these considerations
to the observed portfolio behavior of participants in the U.S. financial
markets other than financial intermediaries, including especially the

household sector. Section 3 quantifies the role of financial intermediaries,
at the aggregate level, in the United States. Section 4 details the
respective roles of several specific kinds of intermediaries, including
commercial

banks, nonbank deposit institutions, life insurance companies

and pension funds, and federally sponsored intermediaries. Section 5
briefly summarizes the chapter's principal points.

1. Rationales for Financial Intermediation
Three basic rationales typically motivate the reliance on financial

intermediaries in the modern economy: benefits of size and specialization,
when there are economies of scale in gathering information or in processing
transactions; diversification of specific asset risks, when asset holders
are risk averse; and pooling of liquidity or other risks, when asset

themselves face uncertain contingencies.

holders

1.1. Benefits of Size and

in

Specialization.

Many economic activities

economies of scale, at least up to a point1 and what

takes place

the financial markets is no exception. At the simplest level, the data

processing equipment needed to process many financial transactions efficiently

is expensive. Acquiring it to meet the sole needs of any financial market
participants but a few of the largest businesses would be out of the

question. The obvious solution is sharing effected by reliance on specialized
institutions.

i

analogous

argument applies to the human capital represented by

the specific knowledge required either to operate sophisticated equipment

or to perform the purely human aspects of financial transactions. The kinds
of human capital involved in the services provided by financial intermediaries
go well beyond mere transactions processing, however. The existence of
assets bearing uncertain returns, due to either market or specific risk,

creates a need for information-related activities; Holders of such assets
must first discover the attendant risks, and then monitor them on an ongoing

basis. These information costs are especially large in the case of

negotiated

to

loans

like

home mortgages, consumer credit, and

bank

loans

businesses, although some kinds of securities investments have similar

characteristics. Once again, the obvious solution is for most asset holders

—4—

to delegate

these information gathering and monitoring costs to specialized

third parties.

In some cases economies of scale are sufficiently great that assets
simply become indivisible beyond set limits.

Many kinds of investments

available in today's financial markets have minimum transaction sizes.

Real estate assets are a common example, as are participations in newly

created business enterprises. In principle, of course, an investor could
directly obtain a smaller unit size at some price, but in practice no one

does so. In such cases the more straightforward, and economically more
sensible, approach to such indivisibilities is to hold the relevant assets
through intermediaries.

1.2. Diversification of Specific Asset Risks. Investors who are
risk averse care not just about the most likely return associated with their
asset holdings but also about the uncertainty associated with that return.
For a given level of uncertainty, of course, investors presumably prefer

a higher expected return to a lower one. Conversely, for a given expected
return, risk averse investors prefer less uncertainty to more.

When different assets bear specific risks that are not perfectly

correlated — as is the case, for example, among equity investments in
different companies — investors can reduce the level of uncertainty
associated with the return to their overall portfolios by holding a diverse

mix of assets rather than only one. By doing
of the

so

they can take advantage

imperfect correlation among the individual asset returns, in effect

exploiting the "law of large numbers" as some assets end up delivering

higher than expected returns and others lower, to achieve a total portfolio
return more likely to fall within any stated range above or below the
associated expected return.

—5—

Such diversification is, in essence, the motivation behind mutual

funds. A risk averse investor is better off, in the sense of facing less
uncertainty for a given expected return, holding a diversified portfolio

of equities rather than just one stock. The same argument holds for
mortgages, consumer and business loans, and a wide variety of other assets.

Pther than betting on whether any single borrower will default, a risk averse
investor is in each case better off holding a portfolio of many such loans.
Because of indivisibilities and economies of scale in asset holding,

however, this kind of diversification is not feasible for most individuals

or for most nonfinancial businesses acting on their own. Few investors
have sufficient capital even to acquire well diversified equity portfolios

consisting of round lots of each security. Fewer still have sufficient
capital to acquire and service portfolios of mortgages or other loans.

The obvious solution is to achieve the required diversification through

intermediation. Financial intermediaries in effect transform assets,
therefore, holding assets subject to specific risk while issuing against
them claims in which these specific risks are largely diversified away.

1.3 Risk Pooling. Risks associated with their portfolios of
financial assets are hardly the only kind of risks that individuals and
businesses face in today's environment. At the individual level, people
can lose their jobs, suffer expensive illnesses, have automobile accidents,

or see their houses burned or burgled. Businesses face many of the same
contingencies, as well as more directly business—connected risks like weak
market demand, delivery failures, or lawsuits.

The pooling of such risks via explicit insurance arrangements is
a long-standing practice, and both life and casualty insurance have been

familiar examples of financial intermediation for centuries. By insuring

—6—

against a specific contingency, an individual or business in effect accepts
a cost equal to the average incidence of that contingency within the

insured population. Although it is possible to imagine such insurance
taking place in abstraction from any financial intermediation per se, in
practice almost all insurance arrangements guarantee performance through

the holding of financial reserves. Moreover, certain forms of life
insurance have traditionally combined saving and risk pooling features.

Risk spreading via financial intermediation goes well beyond

insurance arrangements, however. Banks and other deposit intermediaries
in effect pool the liquidity needs of many individual and business depositors.
Just as risk pooling makes sense in an insurance context because it is
highly improbable that all houses will burn or all automobiles will crash
in any year, deposit intermediation is advantageous because not all
depositors are likely to want to withdraw their funds on the same day,

or even in the same week or month. Deposit intermediaries in effect
exploit the imperfect correlation among depositors' uncertain liquidity
requirements to achieve yet.a further kind of asset transformation, holding
portfolios that may consist mostly of highly illiquid assets while issuing
against them claims which each depositor can rightly regard as fully

liquid. Even some nondeposit intermediaries, like open—ended mutual funds,
perform an analogous transformation.

Because of these three basic economic effects achieved by the

intermediation process —exploitation of economies of scale, diversification
of specific asset risks, and risk pooling — the development of intermediation
in general and of specific intermediary institutions has typically paralleled,
and has often spurred, the evolution of modern financial markets.

2. The Portfolio Behavior

of

Nonfinancial Investors

The function of the financial markets in any economy is to provide

for the needs of participants in the nonfinancial economy. On one side,
individuals and businesses come to these markets to find financial resources,
seeking

to issue claims of various forms in exchange for those resources.

At the same time, others come with resources to deploy, seeking to acquire

in exchange for them some kind of claim on resources in the future. The
unwillingness of some individuals and businesses to hold directly the
claims that others issue creates the need for intermediation.

2.1. Households. In the United States individuals are

the

principal

nonfinancial holders of assets that represent direct claims on other

nonfinancial participants in the economy. Figure 1 shows that U.S.
households have shifted the composition of their financial asset portfolios

in important ways during the post-war period.2 Households' aggregate
holdings of deposit—type liabilities of financial intermediaries have
grown continually from the early l950s to the early l980s, not only
absolutely but in relation to overall nonfinancial economic activity (and

personal income). Households' claims on insurance and pension reserves
have also grown on balance during the post—war years, although here the
growth has been less steady because of the effect of equity price changes

on the valuation of these reserves. By contrast, households' direct
holdings of nonintermediated debt have declined in relative terms almost
continually since World War II, and their direct holdings of equity claims
on business corporations have varied mostly with equity price fluctuations,

exhibiting little overall relative trend.3 Since the total size of
households' financial asset portfolios in relation to gross national product

has also shown no overall trend —

years, then rising sharply in the 1950s, remaining steady through

the 1960s, declining in the l970s, and then rising again in the early

1980s — these patterns of growth and decline in comparison to gross
national product also correspond, for the post—war period as a whole, to
growth or decline in shares of households.' aggregate portfolio.

Households' increasing preference for claims on intermediaries
has appeared even more pronounced from the perspective of their accumulation

of financial assets. Table 1 provides an indication of U.S. households'
portfolio preferences during the post World War II period by presenting
data, both in dollars and as percentage shares of households' total net
acquisition of financial assets, showing the average volume of net

acquisition of various specific asset categories. In order to abstract
from year—to—year variations, yet still capture significant changes over
time, the table presents these data in the form of averages for successive
five-year periods (and the three-year average for 1981-83)..

out most sharply here are the dominance of deposits and of life insurance

net purchases, in every

since

1958 they have sold more direct equity shares than they have purchased.
Capital

gains

have therefore accounted for more than all of the increase

in total value of their direct equity holdings during this period. Moreover,
allowing for the shift from direct ownership of equities to indirect
ownership via mutual funds does not alter this picture of individuals'

investment behavior. Households in the aggregate were net purchasers of
mutual fund shares during the rise of that industry in the l960s, and have
been again during 1980-83, but in neither period were mutual fund purchases
sufficient to offset the liquidation of their direct equity holdings.

During the 1970s households were net sellers of both direct equity

holdings and mutual fund shares. Hence the conclusion stands that equity
price movements have accounted for more than all of any increase in the
value of individuals' equity holdings for the past quarter century.
Because equity prices have fluctuated widely but shown little net gain
since the mid 1960s, even in nominal terms, the aggregate equity portfolio
of individuals in the United States has shown no trend movement in nominal
value and has declined in relative value during the last decade and more.
This shift of individuals' investment flows away from equities
during the second half of the post—war period probably reflects several
considerations in addition to the economies-of—scale and diversification

motives noted above

as

general advantages of intermediation. No doubt

changing birth rates, age distributions, and income levels have all played

some role. The increasing government provision of health, education and
income security benefits has also altered the objectives associated with

—10—

saving for many people. The growing importance of workers' claims on
future pension benefits, including job-specific pensions in both the

private and public sectors and also Social Security, has especially
changed many people's need to accumulate assets directly to finance their

retirement.4 Perceptions of the relative returns and risks associated
with different assets, including both debt and equity securities, have

also changed markedly during the post-war period. After the official
unpegging of bond prices in 1951, fixed—income securities became subject
to market risk in addition to inflation risk, and since the l970s both

inflation risk and market risk have increased dramatically. During most
of the l950s and 1960s renewed confidence in economic stability and
prosperity lessened fears of any collapse of equity values comparable to
that of 1929-33, and in addition many people regarded equities as a "hedge"

against price inflation.5 Following the rapid acceleration of inflation
and the poor performance of both equity prices and the U.S. economy during
the 1970s, however, prevailing opinion became progressively more skeptical
both of the economy's long—run growth prospects and of the usefulness of

equities as an inflation hedge.6
Apart from equities, holdings of direct claims against other
nonfinancial participants in the economy has always constituted a relatively

small fraction of U.S. households' aggregate portfolios. As Table 1 shows,
net acquisitions of such debt have accounted for less than one—fourth of

households' financial saving throughout the post-war period. Against this
background of households' aversion to holding direct claims in either debt or
equity form, the need for financial intermediation is readily apparent.

2.2. Other Nonfinancial Investors. Although individuals are the

businesses also advance a substantial

lending

from just over one—third in the early

since the 1970s. In addition, business

via purchases of nonfinancial commercial paper has remained

relatively small, so that

trade credit —typically equal to 15-18%

of the

gross national product, and mostly borrowed and lent within the corporate
sector — remains the primary vehicle for businesses' holdings of direct
claims

on nonfinancial obligors.

Foreign investors have held a small but growing share of direct
claims on nonfinancial participants in the U.S. economy throughout the

post-war period.7 The growth of foreign holdings was especially rapid

during the l970s, as the persistent U.S. balance of payments deficit
transferred assets abroad, especially to member countries of the international

oil cartel. This rapid growth

proceded from a small base, however, so

that

foreign holdings still represented less than 5% of all direct claims
against U.S. nonfinancial obligors as of yearend 1983. Nevertheless, the

concentration of foreign (especially foreign official)investments.-in
specific instruments has made foreign holdings of somewhat greater
importance

in several U.S. markets. The yearend 1983

has shifted to

the task of meeting the needs that nonfinancial participants

the economy have brought to the U.S. financial markets. As of 1983

individuals in the aggregate remained the largest single class of holders

of all direct claims on nonfinancial borrowers and share issuers — but
only by virture of their continuing domination of the ownership of

corporate equities, as the contrast between Figures 2 and 3 shows. On an
overall basis, however, the household share either including or excluding
equities has declined, as has the share held by all other nonfinancial

investors. As the share of direct claims on nonfinancial entities held
by all nonfinancial investors has declined, the share held by financial

intermediaries has correspondingly risen. Intermediaries' holdings first
accounted

for the majority of all direct claims outstanding in the U.S.

financial

markets (including equities) in 1969, and they have remained

the majority ever since.

Table 2 presents flow data indicating the even stronger post-war
dominance

of intermediaries in meeting the new funds required each year by

nonfinancial participants in the U.S. economy. The table shows data both in

dollars and as percentage shares of all net funds extended to all nonfinancial
sectors.

Apart from accumulating

gains on equities, individuals

private domestic nonfinancial investors have played only a

small and (except for the early 1980s) shrinking role in meeting directly
the needs that nonfinancial entities have brought to the U.S. financial

markets.8 Similarly, the role of the federal government has been consistently
small in this context, and that of foreign investors has grown but remains

small nonetheless. In part because of the growing fraction of nonfinancial
sectors' needs that have come in the form of debt issued by private borrowers
rather than government borrowers (at least until the l980s) , as well as
for other reasons related to financial innovation, nonfinancial investors
have instead accumulated claims on intermediaries and have left to them

the task of directly allocating the economy's financial resources. As
Table 2 also shows, banks, savings institutions and nondeposit intermediaries
have all been significant participants in this process.

4. The Role of Specific Intermediaries
The advance of intermediation in the U.S. financial markets since

World

War II has hardly been uniform. The specialization of financial

intermediaries has inevitably led to some playing more important roles

than others, and some experiencing more rapid growth than others, as the
needs and objectives of both borrowers and lenders have

despite several decades of increasing importance of nonbank intermediaries

10

many kinds of discussions ranging from textbook descriptions of the economy
to professional evaluations of monetary policy often proceed as if commercial

banks were the only intermediaries in the U.S. financial markets. This
emphasis on the commercial banking system is understandable in part, in

view of the special role that banks play in the

monetary policy process

by virtue of their relationship to the Federal Reserve System. In addition,
in the past commercial banks were more dominant in financial market activity

recently as the early l970s, commercial banks in

United States enjoyed a monopoly on the right to issue checkable

Since World War II the U.S. commercial banking system has

approximately held its own in relation to the scale of nonfinancial economic

activity, but it has not participated in the economy's overall post-war

—16—

expansion

of intermediation. The approximate stability of the banking

system's relative size is apparent in Figure 3, and also in the more
detailed data on commercial banks' assets and liabilities in relation to
gross national product presented in the upper half of Table 3. The total
size of the banking system in relation to gross national product has shown

essentially no trend during the post-war period. As Figure 4 shows,
there has been little post-war trend in the "income veolcity" of bank

credit,

which consists of most commercial bank earning assets. This

relative stability stands in marked contrast to the pre-war years when,

over

in

nearly a century, the size of the banking system continually grew

relation to gross national product.12

Within the stability of the overall totals, however, the post-war
years have also seen substantial shifts in composition on both sides of
the banking system's balance sheet, as is clear from the percentage share

data presented in the lower half of Table 3. among bank assets, the most
significant development during this period has been the post-war (really
post—depression) recovery of bank loan portfolios, and hence the general

resumption of banks' traditional role as "inside" intermediaries. In
1929 loans constituted 73% of bank credit. During the depression and then
the war years, however, the fall—off in private debt issuing activity
meant that, for all practical purposes, there was little or no loan business

to be had. By contrast, the federal government was then issuing debt in
record volume, and banks

participated in financing it.

By 1935 banks'

securities investments exceeded their loan portfolios, and in 1945 investments

constituted 79% of bank credit. Commercial banks simply were no longer
very commercial. The years since 1946 have largely consisted of a reversal
of the 1930—45 pattern, with bank loans exceeding securities investments

in 1957 for the first time

in

more than two decades, and standing again

at 73% of total bank credit as of yearend l983
In rebuilding their loan portfolios and de-emphasizing their invest-

nnts, banks have both altered the mix of their lending business and changed
the character of their securities holdings. Although banks remain a
principal source of business credit, and commercial and industrial loans

are

still the largest single category of bank lending, these loans no

longer dominate bank loan portfolios as they once did. Instead,
credit

mortgage

and other consumer loans now comprise more th.an one-third of the total.

Especially during the second half of the post-war period, the widespread
use

of bank-issued credit cards has been a major factor in banks' development

of their consumer lending business. Moreover, among business loans per
Se, the larger banks have increasingly become a major element in the
intermediate-term credit market through the use of explicitly longer

maturity loans (in son cases up to

ten years) and revolving credits of

an implicitly ongoing nature. Total bank

investments have grown slowly

since

World War II, but because of tax

their

investments on state and local government issues that, for a few

incentives

banks have so concentrated

years in the early l970s, they held more of these securities than of
federal government debt.

13

Among bank liabilities, the two most significant changes that have

occurred during

the post—war period have been the continual decline of

demand balances and increase of time and saving

either

deposits, relative to

total bank liabilities or gross national product, and the "liability

management revolution" that has greatly increased the larger banks'

reliance on "bought funds." As Figure 4 shows, the income velocity of the
narrow Ml money stock, consisting of currency plus checkable deposits,

—18—

has about tripled over the post—war years as a result of a combination of
influences including economies of scale in the public's holding of cash
balances, the secular rise in nominal interest rates, and the increasingly

widespread use of credit cards and charge accounts.14 This persistent trend
increase in Ml velocity stands in sharp contrast to either the absence of
any trend during 1910-30 or the steeply declining trend during 1930-45.

Onlythe strong growth of time and savings deposits, including the new
negotiable certificates of deposit that first came into existence in 1961,
has accounted for the absence of much post-war trend in the income velocity

of the broader M2 and M3. "Total net credit," consisting of the outstanding
debt of all U.S. obligors other than financial intermediaries, has also
shown no velocity trend.

Large banks' growing use of such liabilities as certificates of
deposit, federal funds, Eurodollar borrowings, commercial paper issues,

agreements and so on — instruments that in son cases represent

repurchase

the development of new financial markets since World War II — has not

only changed banks' balance sheets but also facilitated a major change in
the feasible aggressiveness
expansion

the

of bank lending practices. The enormous post—war

of bank loan portfolios, which banks have achieved in part through

competitive

use of such devices as loan commitxents and medium—term

credits, would probably have been impossible if banks had simply continued
to follow the classic practice of treating their deposits (and other
liabilities) as determined by outside forces.

Finally, it is useful to point out explicitly that because of changes
in commercial bank organization, especially during the 1960s, the representation of banks as having merely held their own during the post—war increase
in the U.S. economy's reliance on financial intermediation relative to

—19—

economic activity risks understating by a wide margin the growing overall
presence

of commercial banks in the financial system. After falling by

more than one-half between 1920 and 1935, the number of american commercial

banks has remained roughly steady

at about 14,000. The number of bank

branches, however, has risen from some 4,000 to over 39,000 during the

post—war years, with most of this growth occurring since 1960. Moreover,
especially since the 1970 Imendments to the Bank Holding Company Act and
the 1980 Depository Institution Deregulation and Monetary Control Act,
banks have increasingly entered activities other than their traditional

loan and deposit business. Most recently, these extensions of activity
have included indirect participation in the securities brokerage business.
Although their direct participation in financial intermediation has not
kept pace with the rising post-war trend, commercial banks have increasingly
enhanced their importance as more nearly full-service financial institutions.

4.2. Nonbank Deposit Institutions. As

is clear from Figure 3, one

group of intermediaries that has accounted for much of the post World War II

increase in U.S. financial intermediation has been the nonbank deposit

institutions

including savings and loan

associations, mutual savings banks,

and credit unions. The public's strong demand for consumer—type time and
savings deposits has enabled these institutions to grow rapidly, not just
absolutely but in relation to economic activity, during most of the post—war

period. Their growth has been great enough to offset the relative stagnation
of the commercial banking system, so that the income velocities of the

M2 and M3 money stocks have shown a modest downward trend. When extrapolated
backward, this trend appears to have been a continuation of the downward

trend associated with corresponding aggregates during the pre—war era
when nonbank deposit institutions were not of major impottance.

The growth of credit unions has been even faster than that of savings and
loan associations, but credit unions constitute another example of rapid

growth

from a small base, and they remain by

groups of institutions. Mutual savings banks

far the smallest of the three

—21—

The history of nonbank deposit institutions in the United States

since World War II has been in large part a story of evolving financial
regulation, including restrictions on these intermediaries' liability issuing

as well as their asset holding. Especially because these institutions
operate under legal and regulatory constraints governing the disposition
of their asset portfolios (although some of these constraints were weakened
by the 1980 Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act),
their aggregate contribution to meeting the financial needs of nonfinancial
participants in the economy has followed a fairly predictable pattern.

Savings and loan associations and mutual savings banks both typically
invest the majority of their assets, in mortgages, so that these two

groups together have become the nation's leading provider of mortgage lending.

This dominance has lessened somewhat in recent years, however, especia1ly
with the increasing prominence of the federally sponsored mortgage pools.
of yearend 1983 savings and loan associations and mutual savings banks
together held more than one-third of all outstanding mortgages, down from
nearly one—half only a few years earlier.

(By comparison, commercial

banks held less than one—fifth of all outstanding mortgages as of 1983.)
Credit unions have instead traditionally invested most of their assets
in consumer installment loans, and as of 1983 they accounted for just over
one—tenth of the outstanding consumer credit.

4.3. Private Nondeposit Intermediaries. As is also apparent from
Figure 3, a significant part of the post World War II increase in the
U.S. economy's reliance on financial intermediation has stemmed from
neither commercial banks nor nonbank deposit institutions but, instead,

from intermediaries that issue only nondeposit claims. There are many
forms

of

such intermediaries operating in the U.S. markets, but among the

—22—

most

familiar and important are life and casualty insurance companies,

private and public sector pension funds,

independent

consumer finance

companies and the "captive" finance companies of nonfinancial businesses,
equity and money market mutual funds, real estate investment trusts, and
securities brokers and dealers.
Table

5 presents

data, analogous to that shown above for the nonbank

deposit institutions, for three specific categories of U.S. nondeposit
intermediaries :15
state

life

insurance companies,

private

pension funds, and

and local government pension funds. The reason, for focusing in

particular

on these three kinds of institutions is not only that they

are the largest of the nondeposit intermediaries but also that their

respective post—war experience reflects interesting contrasts. Because
the low interest rates implicitly paid on the savings component of ordinary
life insurance have increasingly pronipted the use of group and other term

insurance policies, life insurance companies' total assets held and
liabilities outstanding grew little relative to gross national product
during the first half of the post-war period, and since then they have mostly

been declining in relative terms. Moreover, the relative decline in these
companies' life insurance business has been even more pronounced, in that
their growth in recent years has consisted disproportionately of pension

monies which they manage for other businesses. As of yearend 1983 pension
reserves constituted more than two—fifths of U.S. life insurance companies'

total liabilities, up from less than one-tenth in the early post-war years.
By contrast, both private and public sector pensions have experienced

extraordinarily rapid growth throughout these years.16 Tax incentives
at both the individual and corporate levels, business personnel policies
aimed at reducing worker turn—over, features of the collective bargaining

process, and

other

corporate financial objectives have all combined to

favor the mushrooming of private pension liabilities since World War II.

During most of this period, however, businesses had (and many used) broad

latitude to incur pension liabilities without funding them. The 1974
Employee Retirement Income Security Act subsequently specified minimum
standards for the vesting of workers' rights to accumulated pension

benefits and

for

employers' funding

of

vested pension liabilities. Even

so, businesses retain important flexibility in choosing the actuarial
assumptions underlying the calculation of future benefits, the minimum
required amortization of unfunded vested benefits is very slow, and

nonvested benefits require no funding at all. Consequently, many businesses
continue to carry substantial amounts of unfunded liabilities, so that
private pension funds' total assets as shown in Table 5 substantially

understate their liabilities.17 This understatement was especially
great during the l970s when many private pension funds' asset portfolios,

nre than half of which in the aggregate is invested in equities, suffered
an erosion in market value.
State and

local

government pensions, including both teachers' and

other employees' funds, have experienced similar post—war growth. Public
sector workers have the same tax incentive to use the pension mechanism

to spread income beyond retirement as do private sector workers. Although
public sector employers do not have the same tax incentives as do private
businesses, in many cases the political process has favored the use of
pension compensation over current compensation, especially when there is
no pressure to raise tax or other revenues immediately to fund the

accumulating pension liabilities. Hence public sector pension funds have
been and remain substantially underfunded, so that the asset data shown

—24—

in Table 5 greatly understate their liabilities also.l8 The continued
growth of public sector pensions' assets during the l970s, in contrast

to private pensions, reflects merely the smaller share of assets invested
in

equities by public sector funds' portfolios (about one-third in the

aggregate) rather than any difference in funding practices.

The asset mix of these insurance and pension intermediaries, and
hence their role in financing economic activity, has undergone

important changes since World War II. Regulatory changes in the 1960s
allowed many life insurance companies to increase the equity portion of
their portfolios, and since the mid 1960s life insurers have largely

withdrawn from direct home mortgage lending. State and local

pension funds and

government

especially private pension funds have even more

dramatically increased the equity share of their investments, Consequently,
these nondeposit intermediaries have increasingly become a major source

of both debt and equity funds for corporate businesses. As a result of
these portfolio changes, together with the rapid growth

of

pensions and

the (relative) stagnation of the commercial banking system, insurance

companies and pension funds couined have increasingly dominated banks

as holders of claims on the U.S. corporate business sector —

despite

banks' post—war emphasis on loans over investments in governnnt securities.
In the early post—war years these nondeposit intermediaries held only
slightly more claims on the corporate sector than did commercial banks,

but by the 1970s they held more than twice as much.
It is also important to distinguish the claims on business held
by banks, which are overwhelmingly in the form of short- to medium-term
loans, from the corresponding claims held by insurance companies and
pension funds, which consist mostly of long-term debt and equity securities.

—25—

These non-deposit intermediaries have traditionally held more than two-thirds
of all outstanding corporate bonds, and in recent years, they have also

come to hold about one-sixth of all corporate equity. On a flow basis,
these investors have been of even greater importance in providing long—

term debt and equity capital to U.S. business corporations. In addition
to accounting for much or all of the corporate sector's net long-term
bond financing throughout the post-war period, since 1960 they have also
accounted for more than all of its equity financing, absorbing also the

equity holdings liquidated by the household sector. In sum, businesses'
equity and bond financing has become increasingly dominated by these

nondeposit intermediaries. Given their high rates of portfolio turn-over,
especially in comparison with individuals, equity and bond trading has
become even more so.

4.4. Government Sponsored Intermediaries. another important change
that has come about in the U.S. financial markets since World War II
has been the great increase in the federal government's activities as an

intermediary for (and also a guarantor of) private credit. "Off-budget"
sponsored credit agencies like the Federal Home Loan Bank System and the
Federal Intermediate Credit Bank were in operation before World War II,

but the scale of their lending operations was small then. 2s of 1946, all of
these agencies combined held only about $2 billion of assets, the majority
of which consisted of agricultural loans, and they owed only $2 billion

of liabilities. The focus of these agencies' activity turned more toward
support for homebuilding after the Federal National Mortgage Association
began its lending operations in 1955, but as late as 1960, when their
combined assets had reached $11 billion, their total agricultural credit

outstanding

still exceeded their total housing credit. Only since the

—26—

1960s, as the interaction of deposit interest rate ceilings with rising

nominal interest rates led to the introduction of large—scale support for
housing, did government financial intermediation begin

comparable to that shown above for other
the assets of the federally sponsored credit

and the even more recent mortgage "poois" like the Government

National Mortgage association and the Federal Home Loan Corporation.
Government sponsored intermediation has grown rapidly, not just absolutely
but in relation to gross national product, and by 1983 these intermediaries
held more than one-fifth of all outstanding home mortgages and more than
two—fifths of all outstanding farm debt. Moreover, the total housing credit

advanced

by these intermediaries, which have grown especially rapidly since

the onset of periodic diintermediation in the mid 1960s, includes not only

direct

purchases of mortgages but also Federal Home Loan Bank advances

to savings and loan associations, so that the effective amount is even

greater. Federally sponsored intermediaries accounted for 45%, 48%,
52% and 100% of the total net extensions of single-family home mortgage
credit in the high-disintermediation years 1969, 1970, 1974 and 1982,
19

respectively.

Federally

sponsored intermediaries conduct their business much

like private intermediaries, acquiring financial assets on either a loan

or purchase basis, and in turn issuing their own liabilities. There are
at

least two important differences,

intermediaries

however. One

is that government

they typically pursue a profit objective,, they do so within the limitations imposed

5. Summary
Intermediation is a hallmark of all highly developed financial

systems, and the United States is no exception. The U.S. financial markets
are heavily intermediated, and since World War II they have become
progressively more so.

The principal rationales that give rise to financial intermediation
are benefits of size and specialization,, the diversification of specific

asset risks, and the pooling of even broader classes of risk. Each is a
significant factor in accounting for the U.S. economy's reliance on

intermediation. In addition, since World War II a further important factor
has been the economy's continual shift away from government debt toward
the debt of private nonfinancial entities including individuals and businesses.
Nonfinancial investors (primarily individuals) have exhibited a strong
preference for holding the debt of these nonfinancial borrowers via financial
intermediaries rather than directly.

As the U.S. economy's reliance on financial intermediaries overall
has increased during the post—war period, some specific kinds of intermediary

institutions have grown more rapidly than others. Commercial banks have
about held their own in relative terms, while steadily shifting their
basic business back toward lending activities and away from securities

investments. Nonbank deposit intermediaries have grown in relation to
overall economic and financial activity, as the growth of savings and
loan associations has more than offset the (relative) decline of mutual

savings banks. Among private nondeposit intermediaries, life insurance
companies have declined in relative terms while both public and private

sector pension funds have shown exceptionally rapid growth. Finally, the
federal government's participation in the financial intermediation process

—30—

in the United States has also increased rapidly during these years, in
part as a result of the pressures created by the economy's shift to private
instead of government debt.

of the prior experience.
2. The discussion here (and the data plotted in Figure 1 and used in
Table 1 below) refers 'only to financial assets and hence excludes
nonfinancial assets like houses and consumer durables. As of yearend
1983 households' nonfinancial assets, valued at replacement cost,
totaled $4.8 trillion (of which $2.2 trillion was residential real
estate), in comparison to $8.3 trillion of financial assets. The
available current—value data on nonfinancial asset holdings are
understandably weak.

Moreover, these data overstate households! direct equity holdings in

2% of total equity holdings on average during 1946-50 to 6% on average
during 1976—80.

4. Feldstein (1974) , for example, derived a large estimate of Social
Security "wealth" (defined as the present discounted value of expected

future benefits) and found evidence of a significant impact of Social
Security on private saving behavior. Although this work and the

total

literature that has followed it have emphasized effects on
saving behavior, there is no reason to expect the composition of asset
holding to remain invariant.

5. Some of the best known examples of this thinking were Greenough (1951)
and Advisory Committee (1969).
6. Lintner (1975), Modigliani and Cohn (1979) and Feldstein (1979), among
others, have provided analyses of the failure of equity returns to
keep pace with inflation.
7. A distinction documented by Hartman (1978) is that, within the category
of long-term portfolio (as opposed to direct) investments, foreign
investors have mostly bought U.S. equities while U.S. investors have
mostly bought foreign debt securities.
8. Funds generated internally and retained by corporate businesses also
represent a form of investment by the holders of equity shares in
those corporations, of course. Given the large houshold ownership

of equities, including retained earnings in the data shown in Table 1
would greatly increase the share of funds "advanced" by nonfinancial
investors, but would still leave intermediaries as the direct source

of well over half of the total.

9. See Friedman (1980, 1982) for a discussion of the post—war increase
in the role of private debt in the U.S. economy.
10. Gurley and Shaw (1960) first emphasized this phenomenon.
11. Following Glass-Steagall, commercial banks no longer engage on their
own account in investment banking or broker—dealer activities for publicly
offered corporate securities, although they do so for public sector
securities, and in recent years they have been increasingly involved
in arranging direct placements of corporate securities. In addition,
the trust departments of commercial banks continue to be the largest

single factor in private asset management.

12. See the historical account given in Friedman and Schwartz (1963).

13. Banks' holdings of Treasury securities were essentially flat from
1946 until the swelling of the federal deficit in 1975, so that
banks' portfolios of municipals have exceeded their portfolios of
direct U.S. Treasury obligations ever since 1969. Except for
1974—76 and 1980-83, all of the growth in banks' holdings of federal
government debt has consisted of federal agency securities.
14. See Goldfeld (1973, 1976) for a review of the post—war evidence on
money demand behavior.
15. In Table 5, however, the respective size of the three groups is
indicated by their total assets because of the lack of historical
data on pension funds' liabilities.
16. See Bodie and Shoven (1983) and Kotlikoff and Smith (1983) for a
comprehensive survey of the role of pension funds in the U.S. economy.
17. Several of the papers in Bodie and Shoven (1983) investigate the
nature of this underfunding. Although corporations are now required
to report (as a footnote to the balance sheet) the difference between
pension assets and liabilities for vested benefits, there is no easy
way to discover the liability for nonvested benefits.

18. See again Kotlikoff and Smith (1983).
19. The mortgage market receives, as a net addition to available funds, less
than all of the credit provided by the sponsored credit agencies and
mortgage pools if they in turn sell their securities to investors
who would otherwise have held deposits in thrift institutions; see the
analysis of this question in Jaf fee and Rosen (1979).
20. It is important not to draw this distinction too firmly, however.
For example, savings and loan associations have a tax incentive to
hold at least 82% of their asset portfolios in residential mortagages
(or other qualified assets). Also, in the presence of deposit interest
ceilings limiting the pay—out of earnings to holders of deposit shares,
it has never been clear what role the profit motive plays in portfolio
decisions of savings and loan associations or mutual savings banks.
