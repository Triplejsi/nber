No Time to Lose? Time Constraints and Physical Activity
John Mullahy and Stephanie A. Robert
NBER Working Paper No. 14513
November 2008
JEL No. I1
ABSTRACT
Although individuals are all endowed with the same time budgets, time use patterns differ owing to
heterogeneity in preferences and constraints. In today's health policy arena there is considerable discussion
about how to improve health outcomes by increasing levels of physical activity. In this paper, we
explore how individuals endowed with different levels of human capital allocate time to physically-demanding
activities that we characterize as health-producing behaviors. Our data are drawn from multiple years
of the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), which are based on daily time use diaries and include
information on detailed physical activity time uses. Since ATUS time use categories are mutually
exclusive and exhaustive -- i.e. "multitasking" is not accommodated -- we employ a novel econometric
share equation techniques to enforce the adding-up requirement that time use is constrained to 1,440
minutes per day. We find that differential human capital endowments result in different manifestations
of how time is used to produce health. While more-educated individuals, e.g., sleep much less than
less-educated individuals, they utilize some of the time so liberated to exercise and work more. We
find as well that various features of individuals' environments, broadly defined, play important roles
in time allocation decisions.

1. Background and Motivation
Physical Activity, Health, and Time Use
Despite evidence that regular physical activity is associated with decreased
risk for obesity, chronic diseases, and premature mortality (USDHHS, 1996), fewer
than half of the U.S. population engaged in recommended levels of physical activity
in 2005 (MMWR, 2007).

Moreover, there are significant disparities in physical

activity by gender, race, and socioeconomic status such that women, racial/ethnic
minorities, and people with lower education and income have significantly lower
levels of physical activity (MMWR, 2007).
A burgeoning literature aims to understand the various barriers to physical
activity in order to improve the health of the population and reduce health
disparities.

In making choices about how to allocate time to health-enhancing

physical activities, individuals necessarily balance preferences for healthiness and
(perhaps) the intrinsic utility of physical activity against the opportunity costs of the
time spent engaged in such activities, recognizing that the magnitudes of such
opportunity costs arise in part from factors that are exogenously fixed at the time
such decisions are made.

When individuals themselves are asked about their

perceived barriers to exercise, they often cite lack of time due to work and other
demands (Sallis and Owen, 1999; Wolin et al., 2008).

However, very little is

known about people’s actual time use for physical activity, particularly how time
allocations for physical activity are related to time allocations for other aspects of
life (such as work, sleep, caring for others, and other non-exercise leisure
activities), and how factors such as gender, education, and family structure affect
allocation of time for physical activity.
Time use studies allow us not only to investigate how people allocate time for
a particular health-producing activity (i.e., physical activity), but to examine the
allocations that people make for this activity versus others, and factors that are
systematically related to these time-use allocations (Russell et al., 2007).

As

described further below, human capital and its relationship to time use and health
is part of the fundamental analytical tradition in health economics.
Research on time use demonstrates that there have been increases in overall
leisure time in the U.S. in recent decades (Aguiar and Hurst, 2008) including an

1

increase in leisure time allocated to physical activity (Berry, 2007).

Aguiar and

Hurst (2008) demonstrate that the increases in leisure time have been greater
among individuals with less education than among those with more. Nevertheless,
SES differences in physical activity remain. For example, estimates from the 2005
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) show that 54.6% of men and
53.3% of women who were college graduates engaged in regular physical activity,
compared with 37.2% of men and 37.1% of women with less than a high school
education (MMWR, 2007).
Our main task in this paper is to examine the structure of adults’ time use
patterns, with an emphasis on time allocated to physical activity.

We examine

whether

demographic

individuals'

economic

endowments,

human

capital,

circumstances, and external environments influence time use choices in general
and, specifically, with respect to time allocated to physical activity.

We are

particularly interested in whether human capital, in the form of educational
attainment, influences the manner in which individuals allocate time towards or
away from physical activity.
Since

time

is

a

fundamental

input

into

the

production

of

health,

understanding how and why time use patterns emerge should be an important
ingredient in thinking more creatively about how to improve individual and
population health. We anticipate that this research will advance understanding of
health-related

time

allocation

decisions

by

providing

a

solid

economic

conceptualization of these phenomena, by utilizing extraordinarily interesting data
that speaks to this conceptualization, and by deploying a novel econometric
methodology within which these issues can be addressed straightforwardly and
robustly.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
several conceptual or theoretical approaches

2. Time Allocation, Human Capital, and Health: Theory
The context of human capital and its relationship to time use and health is
part of the fundamental analytical tradition in health economics dating back to
Grossman's seminal work in 1972, and thus even further back to Becker's seminal
work on the economics of time allocation in 1965.

In the canonical Grossman

model, time and goods are invested, via health production functions, in such a way
as to influence the next period's health capital level which itself corresponds to how
much healthy time and unhealthy time individuals enjoy in the subsequent period.
In this context, human capital stocks (e.g. educational attainments) influence the
efficiency by which time and goods translate into ultimate health outcomes.

The

role of time and time costs in health production has become quite prominent, for
instance, in the conceptual and empirical economic analysis of obesity (Cutler et al.,
2003; Philipson and Posner, 2008).
Our main premise is that individuals differentially endowed with human
capital are likely to exhibit different patterns of time use when factors orthogonal to
human capital endowments are held constant. Since one important feature of time
use is how individuals allocate time budgets towards (or away from) time spent
engaging in health-enhancing physical activities, one consequent prediction would
be that the amount of human capital individuals bring to the Table will be related to
the amount of human capital -- specifically, health capital -- that they take away
from the Table.
However because some of the important determinants of time use patterns
(e.g. shadow prices of different forms of time use, or wage rates) will typically not
be orthogonal to human capital endowments -- e.g. higher educational attainment
and higher wages -- the prediction of how human capital endowments influence
health-enhancing

time

use

patterns

and,

ultimately,

health

outcomes

is

theoretically ambiguous. The goal of this paper is to shed some empirical light on a
set of such relationships in order to sharpen our understanding of time use
determinants and, downstream, to understand how interventions might be designed
to encourage healthier or discourage unhealthier uses of scarce time.
There are many potential pathways through which human capital stocks
might be expected to influence time use patterns. First, and most obvious, is that

3

differences in human capital stock levels (e.g. educational attainment) will translate
into differences in labor market productivity that will in turn translate into
differential marginal rewards (wage rates) for forms of time use like labor supply.
At the margin, individuals will respond to such differential reward rates in making
time allocation decisions, including how much time to dedicate (or not) to health
enhancing activities. An important study in this genre is Biddle and Hamermesh,
1990, who demonstrate empirically how higher market opportunity costs of time
(wage rates) translate into reduced demand for sleep time.

To the extent that

increased time over the typical margin in a population is health enhancing, the
Biddle-Hamermesh results suggest that -- at least in a static context -- more
human capital does not automatically translate into better health outcomes.
Alternatively, at a theoretical level, time constraints are equally binding for
all individuals -- 1,440 minutes per day, 8,760 hours per year, etc. -- and within
these bounds individuals are free to allocate their time budgets as they wish subject
to constraints imposed by physical laws like gravity. At a practical level, however,
choices -- including time use choices -- individuals have made in the past as well as
the consequences of these choices are likely to imply varying degrees of quasi-fixity
of current-period time use patterns, with the implication that departures from such
patterns are likely to be costly either in a monetary or in a psychic sense.1 (See
Heckman, 1980, and Hamermesh, 2005, for two perspectives on how past time
allocation choices might influence current patterns of time use.) The role of human
capital stocks in such a setting is to dictate in part the extent to which the
ostensible fixity of individuals' circumstances may be rendered more flexible by,
e.g., the enhanced resources that can be commanded by individuals having higher
levels of human capital (e.g. in the form of financial wealth).
Our guiding hypothesis is that many individuals are confronted with
significant constraints on their allocation of time for physical activity, and these
1

For instance, if my child attends regularly a formal day care setting and I elect to
allocate my time in such a manner that I fail to pick her up by the 6PM closing time
(e.g. by attending an after work event at a local tavern), then I am likely to pay
both monetary costs (for staff overtime) as well as to suffer psychic costs (for being
a lousy parent).

4

constraints differ importantly by level of human capital (e.g., educational
attainment).

However, the prediction of how human capital influences time

allocated to physical activity is ambiguous because there are both substitution and
wealth effects at work: since the shadow price of non-labor time use is relatively
greater for high-wage individuals, they may spend less time engaged in healthpromoting activities (as was documented in the Biddle-Hamermesh study for
activities like sleep).

Yet individuals who have amassed high levels of human

capital are both more able to afford health-producing behaviors and more likely to
prefer greater levels of produced health.
While our focus is ultimately on time use as an input into the production of
health, it is useful to sketch a broader economic framework that encompasses
considerations of the "demands" for various forms of time use but that also speaks
to the broader issues of the role of human capital sketched above.

Assume

individuals are endowed with utility functions
u = u(h,z,t,v;e),
where h is a measure of health, z is a vector of other commodities produced by
combining goods and time, t=[t1,...,tM] is a vector of time use activities, v is a
vector of other commodity-producing variable inputs that may also confer direct
utility, and e is a vector of exogenously given environmental (social, natural, etc.)
measures that may influence the marginal utilities of the other utility determinants
(e.g. ceteris paribus, ice cream and time jogging may be more enjoyable at
temperatures of 75F than of 15F).
Health outcomes are produced via the health production function

h = h ( t, v, k, q, e )

in which k is a vector describing dimensions of non-health human capital, and q is a
vector representing features of family or household structures.

The other

commodities, z, are produced using the same inputs as go into production of h;
note that z may include outputs like the health or wellbeing of other family

5

members. The full income (time and money) constraint is
M

∑m=2 tm = E + w(k)T ,

pv + w(k)

where labor supply is t1, total time endowment is T (e.g. 1,440 minutes per day,
8,760 hours per non-leap year, etc.), endowment income is E, and where market
wages are written as an explicit function of human capital. The demand or choice
functions that result from constrained utility maximization include the time demand
functions
tm = tm (k, q, e,E, p ) ,

m=1,...,M

or, in shorthand,
t = t(x),

whose empirical counterparts, cast as the conditional expectations E ⎡⎣ t x ⎤⎦ , are the
main focus of the subsequent analysis.

In this setting, we will be focusing

particularly on the roles played by human capital (measured here most prominently
by

educational

attainment),

family

structure

(kids'

age

structure,

marital

arrangements), and environmental features of several kinds.2
3. ATUS Data and Sample Construction
ATUS Surveys

Empirical analysis of time use data is certainly not a new enterprise (see
Juster and Stafford, 1991, and Hamermesh and Pfann, 2005).

However, only

recently have data been sufficiently rich that analysts can begin realistically

22

It should be noted that the empirical analysis we undertake below does not have
information on any relevant goods' prices (p) and has at best rough proxy
measures of endowment income (E).

6

thinking about how to deploy time use data to explore issues involving individuals'
health (see Russell et al., 2007, for a discussion of health-related measures in the
ATUS).

While this paper does not tackle health issues per se, the ATUS data

nonetheless provide a level of breadth and depth that permits us to explore how
determinants of time use are likely to translate into health outcomes through the
time use channel—particularly through time use for physical activity.
The data used in this study are from the 2005 and 2006 American Time Use
Surveys administered by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The ATUS universe is
all residents living in households in the U.S. who are at least 15 years old,
excluding active military personnel and persons residing in institutions (e.g.,
nursing homes and prisons).

The ATUS sample is drawn from the Current

Population Survey (CPS), using a three-stage process.

In the first stage, CPS

respondents are sampled to produce an ATUS sample that is distributed across the
states in approximate proportion of the national population each state represents.
In the second stage, households are oversampled if they have a Hispanic or nonHispanic black householder.

Households with children are over-sampled and

households without children are under-sampled. In the third stage, a respondent
from each household is randomly chosen among all eligible householders (civilian,
non-institutionalized persons ages 15 or older). The ATUS response rate averaged
56.6% in 2005 and 55.1% in 2006.
Over 2,000 respondents participated per month in the ATUS during each of
2005 and 2006, for approximate annual sample sizes of 26,000 for each of these
years. The monthly sample was divided into four randomly selected panels for each
week of the month. The sample was then further split evenly between weekdays
and weekend days, with 10% of the sample assigned to each weekday and 25%
assigned to each of the two weekend days.

The designated respondent was

randomly assigned a day of the week to report on.

The phone interviews with

respondents (in English or Spanish) included a combination of structured questions
and conversational interviewing, focusing particularly on a time-use diary.
Time Use Data

The time-use diary collects a detailed account of the respondent’s sequential

7

activities "yesterday" starting at 4:00 a.m. the previous day and ending at 4:00
a.m. on the interview day. For each activity reported, the interviewer also collected
information about how long the activity lasted, and for most activities, data were
collected about who was present and where the activity took place. If respondents
listed multiple activities at one time, they were asked to choose which one was the
primary activity.

Activities were then coded in minutes and add up to a total of

1,044 minutes, with only one primary activity coded for any given minute.

The

only secondary or simultaneous activity that was coded was care of children under
age 13. These secondary childcare estimates are made by summing the duration of
activities during which respondents had a child under age 13 in their care while
doing a primary activity. While we do not undertake an analysis of these data in
the current version of this paper, we expect to incorporate considerations of these
issues in a future version.
One of the strengths of this study is that we examine several types of time
use categories simultaneously. We break the allocation of time into six categories:
sleep, household and personal activities, care for others, work, non-exercise leisure
activities, and physical activities. (This categorization of the time use measures is
primarily based on aggregating the 18 two-digit classifications used in the ATUS,
with exceptions noted).
Since sleep time has been of considerable interest in the health literature,
and has been shown to vary by SES in particular (Biddle and Hamermesh, 1990),
we include a separate time use category for "sleep" (tsleep). For our purposes, the
total amount of time sleeping includes an estimate of actual sleep time but does not
include time listed as "sleepless" (which is combined under other household and
personal care activities).
"Household and personal activities" (thhpers) includes a number of activities
viewed as part of daily life such as household chores, using services (professional,
personal, or household), consumer purchases, eating and drinking, and personal
care (other than sleeping). In addition, all time spent in travel between activities
(except for walking listed for the purpose of exercise) are coded here.
"Caring for others" (tcare) includes providing care for and helping both
household and nonhousehold members of any age. This class of coding has fairly

8

conservative coding criteria as it requires that the care or help be not only the
primary activity, but also that it not be easily counted as something else.

For

example, "watching television with my child" is coded as a leisure activity rather
than care, and "helping my spouse cook dinner" is considered a household activity
rather than care. Care provided through an organization is coded as a volunteer
activity rather than as care for a nonhousehold member.
"Work" (twork) refers to all working and work-related activities (except travel
to and from work), including activities like work-related socializing and job search
activities.

While the term "market work" is not used in the ATUS lexicon, it is

appropriate to think of this work category as such.
For

leisure

time,

we

distinguish

between

time

spent

on

"physical

activity/exercise, not work-related" (texerc1), which we refer to as “physical
activity”, and "non-exercise leisure activities" (tnonexc1). We consider physical
activity/exercise to include all the ATUS codes under "Sports and Exercise" (e.g.,
playing sports, running, lifting weights) with the exception of some subcodes that
we decided might not count as exercise as they, on average, are less active:
billiards, boating, bowling, fishing, hunting, and vehicle touring/racing. The latter
activities were allocated to non-exercise leisure activities, which puts them with
other recreational activities such as watching sports, watching television, relaxing,
listening to music, and attending arts, cultural, and entertainment events; we also
put religious and volunteer activities in this category, as well as education activities
(note that we restrict our analyses to respondents ages 25 and older). However, in
a sensitivity analysis described later, we create a second set of measures in which
billiards, boating, bowling, fishing, hunting, and vehicle touring/racing are allocated
to the physical activity category (texerc2) and away from the non-exercise leisure
category (tnonexc2).
Explanatory Variables

Because ATUS respondents were chosen from among CPS respondents, CPS
data are merged with ATUS data. The CPS interview takes place approximately five
months before the ATUS diary date.

As a consequence, the range of measures

available for defining explanatory variables is extended significantly since both the

9

ATUS interview component as well as the CPS information can be utilized.
The main covariates from the ATUS and ATUS-CPS data used in the analysis
are: gender (female); age in years (age); race/ethnicity (blacknh (non-Hispanic
black),

Hispanic,

otherre

(other

race),

and

non-Hispanic

white

(omitted));

educational attainment (hsgrad, somecoll, collgrad, advdeg (less than high school
graduate omitted); or a pseudo-continuous years of education measure, educ);
marital status (widowed, divsep, nevmarr (currently married omitted)); presence of
a spouse in the household (sppreshh); household size (hhsize); season (autumn,
winter, spring (summer omitted)); and day of week (sun (Saturday omitted); or
tue,...,fri (Monday omitted)).

Additionally, we anticipate that intra-household demographic structures will
play an important role in the way adult household members allocate time. As such,
we define and include in our econometric specifications various sets of measures
that indicate the age categories of the youngest child in the household (yghh0005
(5 or younger), yghh0611 (6-11)), a variable indicating the presence of an own
non-household child under the age of 18 (pknhlt18), a variable indicating the
number of household children under the age of 18 (nkhhlt18).

Finally, in some

specifications we consider the inclusion of family income measures despite the
legitimate concern about their endogeneity in a model of time use (fi2550, fi5075,
fi75100, fi100150, fi150up (family income $0-$24,999 omitted)).

These ATUS and ATUS-CPS measures are supplemented by merging at the
state- and diary-month-level information on several factors that may reasonably be
hypothesized to influence time use choices.

First, state-level data on average

monthly temperature (temperature) and total precipitation (precip) from the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are linked (data are not
available for Alaska and Hawaii). Obviously these are coarse measures, particularly
so for states having large latitude ranges.3

Second, state-level monthly data on

unemployment rates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) are merged;
contemporaneous and one-month lagged measures are considered (uerate,
3

In future work we plan to obtain and merge more geographically- and temporallyspecific climate data. See Connolly, 2008, for discussion.

10

ueratelg).

Finally annual state-level data (estimates, more accurately) on the

prevalence of overweight/obese or obese adults (stobover, stobese) from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factors
Surveillance System (BRFSS) are merged. Based on the individual's diary month,
a weighted average of the current and prior years' data is computed, with weights
(month-1)/12) and ((13-month)/12), respectively.
Sample Characteristics

In the combined 2005 and 2006 ATUS, there are 18,484 observations on
individuals ages 25-64. We focus on this age group in our analysis based on the
notion that individuals of these ages are (largely) post-schooling and (largely) preretirement.

In this age window, 16,217 observations have fully intact time use

data and thus constitute the main estimation sample.4

Of these, 8,265 are

observations on individuals whose time diaries were completed on weekends or
holidays and 7,952 are on observations whose time diaries were completed on nonholiday weekdays (recall that the sampling structure is designed to accomplish an
approximately 50% split between weekends and weekdays). Since we expect time
use patterns to be different on weekends and weekdays, we will estimate separate
models for these subsamples (controlling via dummy variables in both instances for
the particular day of week on which the sample is taken).

Due to the missing

climate data for Alaska and Hawaii, the main estimation samples will be based on
samples comprising 8,216 weekend observations and 7,907 weekday observations.
The unweighted summary statistics for the time use measures and the
covariates are presented in Tables 1 and 2.

Table 3 demonstrates the differences

in summaries of the time use measures between the unweighted and weighted

4

Fully intact time use data correspond to observations having zero values for all of
the ATUS two-digit "50" subcategories. Insofar as selection on observables within
the 25-64 sample is concerned, a simple logit regression of time use data
missingness on basic demographic variables suggests that older individuals,
females, individuals with larger household sizes, and college graduates and
advanced degree holders are relatively more likely to have missing or otherwise
unusable time use data than their respective counterparts.

time of week, while Figure 2 depicts time use patterns by educational attainment
and time of week. Even at this level of evidence, gender, education, and time-ofweek differences are evident and prominent. Figure 3 displays the detailed sample
distributions of each time use measure.
4. Econometric Strategy
Limited Dependent Variable Estimation

The available time use data from the ATUS comprise M mutually exclusive
and exhaustive-of-1440-hours information on respondents' time use patterns for
one randomly selected weekday or one randomly selected weekend day. Because
these data necessarily satisfy the adding up condition

M

∑ j=1 t j = T , the nature of the

time demand functions is formally that of economic share equations found, for
example, in the analysis of household expenditure patterns or portfolio allocation
decisions (Poterba and Samwick, 2002; Woodland, 1979).

Normalizing the total

amount of time available to T=1 formalizes the comparison to the share equation
context. Various econometric methods have been used in the literature to analyze
time use (Kooreman and Kapteyn, 1987, and Wales and Woodland, 1977, as well as
related literature analyzing budget share models, e.g. McElroy, 1987, and
Woodland, 1979). Many of these approaches are built on a multivariate Tobit or on
a Dirichlet probability structure.
Multivariate Fractional Regression (MFREG, MFLOGIT)

As an alternative, this paper uses a generalization of the fractional regression
models proposed by Papke and Wooldridge, 1996, in their study of voluntary
individual contributions to retirement accounts in which the main dependent
variable was the fraction of allowable contributions made by each individual. The
key result in the Papke-Wooldridge paper is that even when the outcome variables
take on values at the extremes of the bounded range they occupy -- i.e. y=0 or
5

The analysis relies henceforth exclusively on the unweighted samples. The most
prominent differences would appear to be with the tcare variable.

12

y=1 -- the fractional regression (FREG) or fractional logit (FLOGIT) method
provides consistent estimates of the parameters of a univariate conditional mean
function μ ( x;β ) so long as μ ( x;β ) is specified with the correct functional form.
In the ATUS time use data, there are many observations of tij=0 on particular
time use categories.

Multivariate Tobit-type estimators can handle such data

structures, albeit at the costs of computational complexity and possible nonrobustness to non-homoskedastic-Gaussian or non-Gaussian probability structures.
Dirichlet distributions may also be non-robust to distributional departures, and also
may not accommodate well the y=0 phenomenon. The proposed extension of the
Papke-Wooldridge strategy to multivariate outcomes usefully steers clear of these
econometric potholes (additional details are provided in Mullahy, 2006).
To this end, let yim=tim/T, m=1,...,M, be the marginal outcomes of interest
such that yim∈[0,1] and

M

∑m=1 yim = 1 .

Then it is natural to want the estimation

strategy to enforce two restrictions that are likely to be important in applications.
First is that E[yim|xi]∈(0,1) for all i; second is that

M

∑m=1 E[yim | xi] =1

for all i; in

this notation, xi summarizes all relevant exogenous determinants of the specified
conditional means.
One

both

these

considerations

is

the

multinomial logit functional form

m=1,...,M

M

∑k =2 exp(xiβk )

= μim ( x ) ,

using the normalization β1 =0. In keeping with the Papke-Wooldridge terminology,
this model might be termed a multivariate fractional regression (MFREG) or
multivariate fractional logit (MFLOGIT) mode.

This model can be estimated

straightforwardly using modifications of standard multinomial logit estimation

13

algorithms (see the Appendix for further details on estimation and inference).6
Average Partial Effects

Owing to the necessary parameter normalization that arises from the addingup restriction, the interpretation of the parameter point estimates in multinomial
logit-type models can be vexing (Crawford et al., 1998). More interesting are the
average partial effects (APEs) of the xik on the conditional means E[yim|xi]. To this
end, in the case where xk is a dummy variable, we compute APEmk as the sample

l , of the difference:

Given the large number of parameters estimated by MFLOGIT, a concern arises
regarding multiple comparisons in hypothesis testing. One could use a Bonferronitype criterion to reduce the probability of type-1 errors across the family of t-tests
or p-values that arise, but Bonferroni criteria are notoriously conservative, i.e.
intolerant of type-1 errors. An alternative, more powerful, approach is to appeal to
the false discovery rate (FDR) control strategies developed by Benjamini and
Hochberg, 1995, and Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2001, which are based on the
individual tests' p-values but accommodate some degree of tolerance of type-1
errors on the analyst's part, thus enhancing test power.
Since the p-values associated with the elements of βl will not be mutually
independent, the conservative criterion suggested in Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2001,
offers a sensible middle ground between the perhaps overly liberal approach of
ignoring altogether the multiple comparisons issue (i.e. making inferences based
only on individual parameters' p-values) and the perhaps overly conservative
Bonferroni strategy. Supplementing the standard p-values, the tables of MFLOGIT
results presented below provide the FDR hypothesis rejection (FDR=1) or nonrejection (FDR=0) recommendations at FDR rate .05.

In the empirical analysis that follows we elect to normalize the MFLOGIT
coefficients by setting βtnonexc = 0 ; consequently the other categories' parameters
should be interpreted as βk − βtnonexc .

The interpretation of the APEs' estimates

does not depend on the normalization, however, and as indicated above these and
their sampling variation are likely to be more interesting for most purposes.

We have estimated a set of specifications that include interactions involving
gender, schooling attainment, and other covariates. Calculation of the relevant
interaction-related APEs is somewhat computationally complicated, however. The
next version of this paper will include a presentation of these results.

Multiple comparisons issues may arise as well in the computation of multiple CIs
(Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2005). We do not address these considerations in the
present version of the paper.

Given the size of the parameter vectors being estimated and corresponding size of
the APE vector, the bootstrap exercise is somewhat time intensive (approximately
four bootstrap iterations per minute). As such, the present version of this paper
estimates the APE CIs using 500 bootstrap iterations for the baseline specifications
and 100 bootstrap iterations for the comparison specifications.

5. Results
Baseline Specifications

The parameter estimates for our baseline specifications are presented in
Tables 4 (weekends & holidays) and 5 (weekdays). These Tables present the point
estimates

(recall

the

βtnonexc = 0

normalization),

robust

t-statistics10,

and

conservative FDR rejection (=1) or non-rejection (=0) recommendation. These are
followed by Table 6, which reports the corresponding APE and .95 CI estimates.
Note that the magnitudes of the parameter estimates are based on scaling the time
use outcomes to the [0,1] or share intervals (i.e. dividing each time use measure
for each individual by 1,440), whereas the APEs are defined on the natural units of
measurement, minutes per day.
In Tables 4 and 5, neither the signs nor magnitudes of the x's roles as
determinants of the t's are informative (owing to the parameter normalization).
However, the statistical significance of many of the individual point estimates (most
usefully indicated by FDR=1), the magnitude of differences across categories for
given xk, and the joint significance of the category-specific parameters (as indicated
by the Wald χ2 statistics) are all suggestive that the conditional time use patterns

E ⎡⎣tk x ⎤⎦ are likely to vary nontrivially with at least some of the x's. The magnitude
of effects for each parameter can then be assessed most straightforwardly by
consideration of the estimated APEs in Table 6.
Table 6 demonstrates the APE and .95 CI estimates. Looking at age, we see
that age has a statistically significant association with all categories of time use on
weekends/holidays.

Each greater year of age is associated with almost two

minutes more per day spent in personal and household tasks (1.883 minutes) and
in non-exercise leisure time (1.965 minutes), and about one minute less spent in
10

In this version of the paper, the parameter estimates' robust covariance matrix
estimator does not consider possible clustering at the state level. The usual cluster
parameter covariance estimator turns out to yield standard error estimates on the
state-level variables that are actually smaller than their non-clustered counterparts.
We have not yet developed the software to generate the clustered bootstrap
confidence intervals (Field and Welsh, 2007); we expect to present these results in
the next version of the paper.

sleep (-1.178 minutes), caring for others (-1.797), working (-.742), and exercising
(-.131 minutes).

For weekdays, there is no statistically significant relationship

between age and time for sleep and physical activity, but age has a positive
association with time spent for household and personal care and leisure activities,
and a negative association with time caring for others and time working.
As demonstrated earlier in Figure 1, gender is significantly related to adult
time use. Looking across all categories of time use on weekends/holidays and on
weekdays, gender has a statistically significant relationship with all forms of time
use

except

one—time

spent

in

physical

activity

on

weekdays.

On

a

weekend/holiday day, women spend almost 7 minutes more time sleeping than do
men, net of all other covariates. On weekdays, they spend about 15 more minutes
sleeping than do men. Women also spend about 83 and 92 more minutes taking
care of household and personal care activities on a weekend/holiday and weekday,
respectively. Women spend more time caring for others on a given day (about 12
more minutes on weekend/holiday days and 39 minutes on weekdays).

Women

spend less time than men working and participating in non-exercise leisure
activities on both weekends/holidays and weekdays.

On weekends and holidays,

women spend about ten minutes less in physical activity than do men, though there
is no statistically significant relationship between gender and physical activity on
weekdays.
When it comes to looking at race/ethnicity and time use, our results
demonstrated that there are clear differences between racial/ethnic groups, and
that

the

patterns

of

difference

vary

depending

on

whether

you

look

at

weekends/holidays or weekdays. Compared to people reporting their race as nonHispanic white, those self-reporting as non-Hispanic black report that on weekends
and holidays they spend significantly more time in sleep and non-exercise leisure
activities (21 and 48 more minutes, respectively), and less time in household and
personal care activities, caring for others, and exercising (54, 17, and 7 fewer
minutes,

respectively).

On

weekdays,

compared

to

non-Hispanic

white

respondents, non-Hispanic black respondents again spend more time sleeping and
in non-exercise leisure activities (17 and 44 more minutes, respectively), and less
time in household and personal care activities and caring for others (22 and 15

17

fewer minutes, respectively).

Although there were no black/white differences in

work time on weekends, we see that black respondents report about 23 fewer
minutes of work than white respondents on weekdays.

And while there were

differences in time use for physical activity on weekends/holidays, there is no
statistically significant difference in time use for physical activity on weekdays
between black and white respondents.

Hispanic respondents report both similar

and different time use patterns from non-Hispanic white respondents.

On

weekends/holidays, Hispanic respondents report more time in sleep (23 minutes)
and time working (16 minutes), and less time in caring for others (-16 minutes)
and participating in non-exercise leisure activities (-22 minutes).

There were no

statistically significant differences in time for household and personal care activities
or in time spent in physical activity.

In stark comparison to weekend/holiday

trends, on weekdays there are no statistically significant time use differences
between Hispanic and non-Hispanic white respondents in any time use activity
except for time spent caring for others, where Hispanic respondents report about
16 fewer minutes in this activity.
Educational attainment is one of the variables of most interest to us in
looking at determinants of time use for physical activity.

On weekends/holidays,

each increment of educational attainment is associated with a higher level of
physical activity. Compared to people with less than a high school degree, those
with a high school degree, some college, a college degree, and an advanced degree
report more time spent in physical activity, although this difference is only
statistically significant for those who are college graduates (20 additional minutes of
physical activity) or who have an advanced degree (28 additional minutes of
physical activity). In contrast, on weekdays, there were no statistically significant
associations between educational attainment and time spent on physical activity,
net of other covariates.

These positive associations between educational

attainment and time allocated to physical activity are particularly interesting given
that educational attainment is negatively related to time use for non-exercise
leisure activities. Whereas more educated people have less time for leisure activity,
they are still more likely to allocate more time for physical activity.
Other interesting results emerging from Table 6 are: the strong seasonal

18

patterns of physical activity that are of approximately comparable magnitudes in
both the weekend and weekday samples; the positive association of temperature
with physical activity for both the weekend and weekday samples, particular
noteworthy given that season is controlled; the negative association of state obesity
rates with physical activity, suggestive of possible social context factors in
individuals' choices regarding physical activity time patterns; and the important role
of

state

unemployment

rates

as

determinants

of

time

working

on

weekends/holidays.
Gender Differences

Recalling that Figure 1 suggested some sizable differences in the marginal
time use distributions of females and males, and given that gender affected all time
use activities in Table 6 which controlled for many covariates, we now consider
formal statistical testing for such differences in the context of our baseline
econometric specifications.

If there are meaningful differences by gender in the

structure of time use determinants, the ultimate story about the role of human
capital (and other) determinants may have to be qualified on a gender-specific
basis. The results of the Wald tests of equality of the separate female and male
coefficient vectors are summarized in Table 7.11

In all cases there is strong

evidence suggesting rejection of the null hypotheses of parameter equality—there
are clear and consistent gender differences in determinants of time use.
Consequently, it is of some interest to investigate how the APEs differ by
gender.

Among the interesting gender differences or

similarities seen in Table 8 for weekends/holidays are: males but not females
exhibit negative age associations with time dedicated to physical activity; college or
advance degree holders of both genders tend to engage in more physical activity,
11

The ideal approach here would be to test the null of gender equality of the APEs.
To obtain reliable bootstrap estimates of the estimated APEs' covariance matrixes
would require a significant increase in the number of bootstrap replications above
what is feasible here. We will undertake this exercise in a subsequent version of
the paper.

19

but the magnitudes of these effects are larger for males; having a spouse present
in the household reduces the time spent on physical activity for males, with no
effect for females; and the state obesity rates are negatively associated with
physical activity time for both genders.

The corresponding results for weekdays

(Table 9) indicate: no strong role for educational attainment in determining physical
activity patterns for either females or males, although the significance and
magnitudes of the educational effects on sleep, personal care, work, and nonexercise leisure time are noteworthy; men with a spouse present in the household
report less time for physical activity; higher temperature is associated with more
physical activity in women but not men, whereas season affects physical activity for
both men and women; living in a state with greater obesity rates is associated with
less physical activity only in women; and no strong race/ethnicity patterns in
physical activity are shown for males, although there are some clear patterns for
females.

Hispanic women, non-Hispanic black women, and women of other non-

white racial groups report less time for physical activity than non-Hispanic white
women on weekdays.
Alternative Specifications of t and x

Several specifications were estimated to assess the sensitivity of our baseline
specifications' assumptions to alternative definitions of t and x.

In the first

alternative, we redefined t in terms of texerc2 instead of texerc1 and tnonexc1,
using the same covariates as appear in the baseline specification.

Recall that

texerc1 is a more stringent characterization of "exercise" behavior than texerc2 —
texerc1

excludes

billiards,

boating,

bowling,

fishing,

hunting,

and

vehicle

touring/racing as physical activities by moving them into non-exercise leisure time
activities (tnonexc1).

The main findings with respect to the texerc2 outcomes

relative to the texerc1 findings reported in Table 6 are that for both the
weekend/holiday and weekday samples the age, gender, race/ethnicity, and
seasonal effects are larger, the educational attainment effects are smaller, and the
temperature and state obesity effects become statistically insignificant.
The next three alternative specifications use the original t definition but
consider alternative definitions of x. In the first of these, an indicator of whether

20

there are any children under the age of 18 living in the household (anyklt18) is
added to the covariates. For both weekends/holidays and weekdays, the estimated
APEs for presence of a child indicate no statistically significant relationship with time
in physical activity. However, presence of a child in the household had statistically
significant but small negative associations with time sleeping, and statistically
significant and large associations with time caring for others and time in nonexercise leisure activities (positive and negative, respectively).
The next alternative specifies a more-detailed set of household structure
Specifically, anyklt18 is replaced with dummy variables

indicating

whether

the

youngest

household

child

is

aged

0-5

(yghh0005;

approximately preschool) or aged 6-11 (yghh0611; approximately elementary
school).

For both weekends and weekdays, the statistically significant results

indicate that having the youngest household child in either age category reduces
time sleeping, working, and in non-exercise leisure activities, and increases time
caring for others, with all these effects being larger in magnitude for the presence
of the youngest household child being 0-5 (except for weekday sleep, where it is
smaller than the effect for the youngest child being aged 6-11). Effects on time in
physical activity are in all instances negative, but only statistically significant for
presence of the youngest household child aged 0-5, and then only on weekdays.
Cognizant of the significant potential for introducing endogeneity bias, the
final alternative specification adds to the covariates in the baseline specification
dummy variable indicators of family income categories. Endogeneity considerations
notwithstanding, it turns out that the various levels of family income tend to have
only weak associations with the physical activity outcomes.

Interestingly, larger

family incomes are associated with reduced mean levels of sleep even though the
magnitudes and significances of the estimated educational attainment effects on
sleep remain impressive.
6. Discussion and Conclusions
This paper has attempted to take a comprehensive look at the structure of
adults' time use patterns with a particular focus on whether individuals' economic
endowments,

human

capital,

demographic

21

circumstances,

and

external

environments influence time use choices in general and, specifically, with respect to
time allocated to physical activity. Data from the American Time Use Surveys from
2005 and 2006 provide an ideal platform on which to build such an analysis. Our
investigation suggests that time use patterns are driven in part by all the
aforementioned factors.

While few of our findings' signs are surprising (in the

sense of departing from commonsense priors), we submit that our empirical results
are particularly valuable for describing magnitudes (as measured empirically by the
APEs) of such relationships in a systematic way that is novel and econometrically
robust.
Our main priority was to examine the association between educational
attainment and time use allocated for physical activity. We found that educational
attainment was positively related to time allocated to physical activity on
weekends/holidays, but not on weekdays, and these effects were stronger for men
than for women.

However, educational attainment was not related to time

allocated to physical activity on weekdays for either men or women. This could be
one place where offsetting effects of education may be at play, as the higher
opportunity cost of time not spent at work may be most acutely felt during
weekdays despite a greater demand for health via health investments like physical
activity.
Consistent with prior research, our results show that people with less
education spend more time in non-exercise leisure activities than do those with
more education; however those with less education spend less time doing physical
activity than do those with more education (Berry, 2007; Aguiar and Hurst, 2008).
This contrast should be further examined in future work, to determine how and why
total leisure time gets allocated to physical versus non-physical activities, and how
this varies by educational attainment and other factors. Moreover, future work that
controls for health may account for some of the positive relationship between low
education and more time for leisure and between high education and more time for
physical activity.

In future analyses, we will examine whether educational

attainment interacts with other variables in predicting time use for exercise, as it
may be that some effects, such as family structure, differ by educational
attainment.

22

Just as our educational attainment variables predicted time use differently on
weekends and weekdays, so did many of our other covariates.

Although we

expected that time use itself would be distributed differently on weekends and
weekdays (e.g., less work time on weekends), one of our main findings is that
many of the covariates we examined operate quite differently on weekends than
they do on weekdays. For example, women had less physical activity than men, but
only on weekends/holidays—there were no gender differences in physical activity
on weekdays.
We also highlight important findings about gender differences in time use.
We found that men and women not only have different overall patterns of time use,
which we expected based on prior work, but that there are predictors of that time
use vary between men and women.

For example, only for men, living with a

spouse is associated with less time allocated to physical activity (on both weekends
and weekdays).

Indeed, some patterns vary specifically by both gender and

weekend vs. weekday. For example, older age is associated with less time spent in
physical activity, but only for males on weekends/holidays.

As another example,

although non-Hispanic black men and women both allocate less time to physical
activity on weekends/holidays than do non-Hispanic white men and women, on
weekdays this difference is only significant between black and white women, with
no race differences for men.
The gender specificity of the results suggests that future research on time
use should continue to separate analyses by gender, as the role of human capital
and other determinants appears to be qualified on a gender-specific basis.
Similarly, the variations in both time use and predictors of time use between
weekends and weekdays suggests that we theorize more carefully about how
people conceptualize their weeks, particularly how they think about time use tradeoffs for different parts of the week (i.e., weekends versus weekdays), or how
structural factors impinge on time use allocations differently on weekends versus
weekdays. While such theorizing has implications for how we think about time use
broadly, it may be particularly informative regarding the design of exercise
intervention programs. For example, new initiatives might work for some groups
better on weekends or weekdays, and this may vary by gender.

23

Also notable was our findings of some significant associations between
physical and social environment variables and time use for physical activity.
Season had a relatively robust relationship with physical activity, with summertime
bringing with it greater physical activity allocations.

In terms of the physical

environment, higher temperature was related to higher physical activity in women,
even controlling for season. Of course, it may be that those who want to exercise
outdoors move to a place where this is more enjoyable. However, counterbalancing
this potential selection effect is that people in ill health (i.e., asthma) also
sometimes move to more temperate climates although they exercise little once
they get there. Future analyses that control for self-rated health status will allow
us to examine this and additional questions in more detail.
In terms of the social environment, living in a state with higher obesity rates
was associated with less time in physical activity among men and women on
weekends, and among women on weekdays.

Although this is consistent with

theory about the role of social norms and social context in determining health
behaviors, it is surprising that this effect is captured using a state-level obesity
variable rather than a more local measure. Given that we demonstrate statistically
significant relationships despite the crude nature of this and other environmental
measures, and while controlling for a range of covariates, we think further
investigation is warranted into the exact nature of these relationships.

Future

research also needs to examine additional state- and local-level covariates.
In assessing both our results and the limitations of our analyses to date, we
have a number of ideas of next research steps or considerations that may be
productive.

Our sensitivity analysis that examined alternative specifications of

“physical activity” found that the specifications matter.

Our main results used a

specification of physical activity that is conservative—that excludes some activities,
such as bowling, that may be less physically active than many other activities, and
that excludes travel time for the activity.

Indeed, when we examined a looser

definition of physical activity that included less physically active recreational
activities (such as bowling), the educational attainment effects became smaller, and
the temperature and state obesity effects become insignificant.

Future research

will need to consider how to best categorize activities as “physical activity”,

24

attending as we did, to those activities that are truly physical versus those that are
not.
In a related issue, we examined total time spent on physical activity in a day,
but did not evaluate the adequacy of time spent on physical activity for each person
on that day. Some studies on physical activity attempt to categorize the amount of
time a person spends being physically active as sufficient or insufficient, per CDC
exercise guidelines of approximately 30 minutes, or by some other guideline.
Future research should examine not only predictors of total physical activity time,
but also predictors of the adequacy of time spent on physical activity.
In addition, in attempting to measure time spent on actual physical activity,
we did not include travel time for exercise in our measurement of time in physical
activity. Although this means our physical activity measure better captures amount
of exertion, it does not represent the total time that people allocate to physical
activity (which would include travel time), and thus we may be underestimating
actual time trade-offs made for physical activity for those physical activities that do
not occur or begin and end at home.
In future phases of this work, we anticipate undertaking more formal
statistical investigations of the characterizations and subsequent categorizations of
exercise time vs. other time.

Specifically, we plan to conduct formal tests of

aggregation of outcomes along the lines suggested by Cramer and Ridder, 1991,
and Hill, 1983, as well as to investigate a variety of data-driven approaches to
category aggregation/disaggregation (see, e.g., Cotterman and Peracchi, 1992).
Moreover, we plan to undertake some additional sensitivity analyses looking at how
to handle "sports and exercise as part of job" under the work category. Also, there
are activities that although coded under a primary activity elsewhere, may provide
physical activity benefits, such as walking for travel purposes, housework, and
some volunteer activities.
A potential limitation of time use data is that the one-day frame of the time
diary means that time use activities that are not undertaken on a regular daily basis
will be missed. Whether this presents any analytical concerns depends on the joint
population distribution of activity frequency over days and the intensity of activities
within days, and possibly on the mode of econometric analysis as well.

25

For

categories like time allocated to physical activity, such considerations may not be
trivial. We hope to explore this issue in greater detail in future work, drawing on
the literature that treats the analogous "purchase infrequency" or "consumption
infrequency" problems in consumer demand analysis (Meghir and Robin, 1992;
Robin, 1993).
In some of our sensitivity analyses, we investigated whether the presence of
a child, and the age of the youngest child, affected time allocations to physical
activity.

Despite literature suggesting the importance of these factors (e.g.,

Kimmel and Connelly, 2007), our results showed non-significant or weak effects.
Presence of a child when the youngest child was aged 0-5 had a small effect on
lower time use for exercise on weekdays, with little other notable effects for related
variables.

However, future research should examine these specifications more

closely, including looking at the role of secondary time use for childcare on physical
activity.
In sum, our results demonstrate that time use for physical activity varies
significantly by a number of individual and environmental variables, and varies
notably by gender and by time of week (weekend vs. weekdays). Future work that
attempts to further understand how and why time gets allocated for physical
activity between different types of people is fertile ground for informing the design
of exercise intervention messages and programs to target those in most need of
increased physical activity. Moreover, simultaneously attending to where physical
activity occurs may be important as well, as research indicates that people with less
education have been spending more of their leisure time at home (Berry, 2007),
putting opportunity or constraint on how that time might be translated into physical
activity. The ATUS presents many opportunities for researchers to further this work
in interesting and fruitful ways.

Appendix: Estimation Details
Appealing to the estimation methods described by Papke and Wooldridge for
the univariate case, one can set up a multinomial logit-like criterion function
Q(β) =

N

M

∏i=1 ∏m=1 μim ( x ) im
y

whose

log

is

J(β) =

∑i=1 ∑m=1 yim × log (μim ( x ) ) ,
N

M

where β is either a kx(M-1) matrix or k(M-1)x1 vector depending on the particular
reference. The corresponding estimating or score equations are:

∂J(β)
=
∂βm

∑

N

x,
i =1 i

⎡
⎛
⎞⎤
exp(xiβm )
⎢y − ⎜
⎟ ⎥ , j=2,...,M,
M
⎢ im ⎜⎜
⎟⎥
1+
exp(xiβk ) ⎟ ⎥
⎢⎣
k =2
⎝
⎠⎦

∑

which are obviously the same solution equations as those corresponding to a
standard multinomial logit estimator; note, however, that in this case the yim are

l follows from standard arguments, in
not binary.12 Consistency of the resulting β
⎡ ∂J(β) ⎤
⎡ ∂J(β) ⎤
particular that E ⎢
x⎥ = 0 .
⎥ = ExE ⎢
⎣ ∂βm ⎦
⎣ ∂βm ⎦
It should be noted that although estimating the model using MNL-type
pseudo-likelihood methods will provide consistent estimates of the βM parameters,
the corresponding MNL covariance matrix will not be a consistent estimator of the
true covariance matrix so long as Pr(yim∈(0,1)|xi)>0, which is to be expected in the
time use data.

In particular, the data in such cases will exhibit underdispersion

relative to a maintained multinomial probability structure. It can be demonstrated
formally that the difference between the MNL covariance estimator obtained as the
negative inverse expected Hessian and the expected standard robust "sandwich"
estimator is positive semidefinite so that, e.g., standard errors obtained using the
MNL covariance estimator will tend to be too large relative to actual standard errors
(a result opposite that more commonly found in the literature on overdispersion).
See Mullahy, 2006, for details.

12

Standard canned multinomial logit estimation packages, like Stata's, do not
readily accommodate nonbinary yim. The estimates presented here are obtained
using an author-written procedure written in Stata's Mata language, Version 9,
which is available on request.
