High Birth Weight and Cognitive Outcomes

NBER Working Paper No. 14524

JEL No. I10
ABSTRACT
While the effects of low birth weight have long been explored, those of high birth weight have been
essentially ignored. Economists have analyzed the negative effects that low birth weight might have
on subsequent school outcomes, while taking into account unobserved characteristics that may be
common to families with low birth weight babies and negative outcomes in terms of school test scores
when children, in addition to labor market income when adults. Today, however, with increasing obesity
rates in the United States, high birth weight has become a potential concern, and has been associated
in the medical literature with an increased likelihood of becoming an overweight child, adolescent,
and subsequently an obese adult. Overweight and obesity, in turn, are associated with a host of negative
effects, including lower test scores in school and lower labor market prospects when adults. If studies
only focus on low birth weight, they may underestimate the effects of ensuring that mothers receive
adequate support during pregnancy. In this study we find that cognitive outcomes are adversely affected
not only by low birth weight (<2500 grams) but also by high birth weight (>4500 grams). Our results
have policy implications in terms of provision of support for pregnant women.

I. INTRODUCTION
While the effects of low birth weight have long been explored, those of high birth weight
have been essentially ignored. Economists have analyzed the negative effects that low birth
weight might have on subsequent school outcomes, while taking into account unobserved
characteristics that may be common to families with low birth weight babies and negative
outcomes in terms of school test scores when children, in addition to labor market income when
adults. Today, however, with increasing obesity rates in the United States, high birth weight is
of potential concern, and has been associated in the medical literature with an increased
likelihood of becoming an overweight child, adolescent, and subsequently an obese adult.
Overweight and obesity, in turn, are associated with a host of negative effects, including lower
test scores in school and lower labor market prospects when adults. We analyze the effects that
high birth weight may have on subsequent test scores for children and adolescents in order to fill
this gap in the literature. We find that the relationship between birth weight and cognitive
outcomes is quadratic in nature. While low birth weight is of primary concern, high birth weight
should not be ignored and can also lead to adverse cognitive outcomes.
Two main national-level data sets are used in this paper. The first, the Child-Young
Adult National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, is a comprehensive data set for the United States
that follows individuals who were 14-22 years of age in 1979 until the present. Starting 1984,
children of these individuals were included in the Child-Young Adult version of the data set. It
is ideal because detailed demographic information on the mothers of the children, including data
on weight, height, and education, is available. The second data set is the Early Childhood
Longitudinal Survey (Kindergarten), another panel data set which follows the same students
from kindergarten onwards. The survey began in the 1998-1999 school year and continues to the
2

present. Both data sets are panel data sets and allow for the tracking of specific individuals over
time.
II. LITERATURE REVIEW
There is an extensive literature on the effect of low birth weight (LBW) on a variety of
adverse outcomes. Relatively little research has been conducted on the possible negative effects
of high birth weight (HBW). For mothers, higher birth weight has been linked to gestational
diabetes and maternal obesity or weight gain during pregnancy (Gunn Eide 2005). Inherited
genes for obesity could explain the association between maternal obesity, high birth weight, and
subsequent obesity in offspring, which may reflect a postnatal environment with unfavorable
dietary and activity habits (Gunn Eide 2005). Others have found that a high, but not low, birth
weight is a risk factor for increased emergency visits during childhood. The risk increases
linearly beyond a birth weight of 4.5 kilograms (Don et al. 2004). Danielzik et al. (2004) find
that parental overweight, a low socioeconomic status, and a high birth weight are the strongest
independent risk factors of overweight and obesity in children.
Studies of the effect of birth weight on cognitive outcomes have generally focused on low
birth weight. Kirkegaard et al. (2006), taking gestation into account, find that children with a
birth weight of 2500 to 2999 grams had nearly twice the risk of reading difficulties than children
with a birth weight of 3500 to 3999 grams. The association between birth weight and reading
difficulties seemed to have a U-shaped pattern with a decreasing risk with increasing birth
weight until 3500 grams and an increasing risk of having reading difficulties above this weight.
They find no association between gestational age and arithmetic difficulties. Children with a
birth weight of 2500 grams had four times the risk of arithmetic difficulties compared with
children who weighed between 3500 and 3999 grams. As was the case with reading and spelling
3

problems, the decreasing frequency of arithmetic difficulties was seen with increasing birth
weight, although at 3500 grams, and subsequently at 3999 grams, the frequency of arithmetic
difficulties again increased.
Using data from Danish conscripts born between 1973 and 1975, Sorensen et al. (1997)
find the score from the “Boerge Prien” test, taken around age 20, increases from a birth weight of
1900 grams to one of 4200 grams. There is a slight decrease after a birth weight of 4200 grams,
again pointing to the nonlinear relationship between birth weight and test scores. Richards et al.
(2001) explore cognitive function at ages 8, 11, 15, 26, and 43 years. They find that birth weight
is significantly associated with cognitive function at age 8 years, with cognitive scores increasing
across the four lowest birth weight categories, and then declining at the highest birth weight
category. These studies indicate that birth weight may be nonlinear in cognitive outcomes, and
that perhaps there needs to be more attention paid to high birth weight in addition to low birth
weight.
III. DATA – NLSY
The 1979 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) is a nationally
representative sample of 12,686 young men and women who were 14-22 years old when they
were first surveyed in 1979. These individuals were interviewed annually through 1994 and are
currently interviewed on a biennial basis. In 1986, a separate survey of all children born to
NLSY79 female respondents began (the Child-Young Adult National Longitudinal Survey, or
the NLS-CYA), with survey questions on assessment as well as additional demographic and
development information collected from either the mother or child. For children aged ten and
older, information has been collected from the children biennially since 1988 on a variety of
factors including child-parent interaction, attitudes toward schooling, dating and friendship
4

patterns, religious attendance, health, substance use, and home responsibilities. Out of 6,283
females in the NLSY79, 5,418 were interviewed in 1986, of which 2,922 were mothers. These
mothers had 5,255 in 1986, 4,971 of which were interviewed. In 2002, 7,467 children or young
adults were interviewed. A detailed description of the data is provided at the NLS website at
http://www.bls.gov/nls. Summary statistics are presented in Table 1.
Dependent Variables
Assessment data include responses to questions on test scores related to the Peabody
Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) for those aged three and older, and the Peabody Individual
Achievement Test (PIAT) for those aged five and older, which includes assessments on math,
reading comprehension, and reading recognition. The PPVT measures the child’s hearing
vocabulary of Standard American English. The PIAT assessments measure ability in
mathematics and oral reading and the ability to derive meaning from printed words. The
standardized scores for these tests were used in our analysis, with a mean for the whole NLS
sample of approximately 100.
Explanatory Variables
Birth weight, and particularly HBW, defined as a baby born weighing more than 4500
grams, is the variable of interest in this paper. Information on characteristics of both the child
and mother are included as additional explanatory variables. Mean birth weight in the NLS
sample is 3366 grams (Table 1). About two percent of children in the NLS-CYA are born with a
HBW while the prevalence of LBW, defined as having a birth weight of less than 2500 grams, is
approximately seven percent.
Control variables include family income, race/ethnic background, age, gender, height,
weight, number of siblings, mother’s body mass index (BMI) at the time the child was delivered,
5

mother’s age at time of birth of child, mother’s education, mother’s age, whether the child was
breastfed, gender, birth order,1 and region of residence. Since extensive information on the
mother is given and since there are many siblings in the NLS-CYA, we cluster regressions by
mother’s ID to account for unobservable characteristics common to siblings and to the same
individuals over time. In addition to these controls, we exploit the information available on the
mother during pregnancy and include the following variables as excluded instruments in our
instrumental variables models: whether the mother used prenatal care, gestation, how much
weight the mother gained during pregnancy, whether the mother was a teenager at the time the
child was born, and whether the mother was over 30 years of age at the time the child was born.2
IV. DATA – ECLS-K
The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K), designed and
collected by the US Department of Education, is a nationally representative data set with more
than 20,000 children from about 1,000 different schools, starting kindergarten in 1998. At the
time this was written, a total of six rounds of data collection have been conducted, held in the fall
of and spring of kindergarten, fall and spring of first grade, spring of third grade, and spring of
fifth grade. The full sample was interviewed in all rounds except the fall of first grade.3 ECLSK data provide a wide range of information on student backgrounds, allowing us to have a rich
set of control variables for the analysis. The data contain a substantial amount of information on
demographic characteristics and parental background. A detailed description of the data is
provided at the ECLS website http://nces.ed.gov/ecls.

First-borns may have an educational advantage over their siblings (Kantarevic and Mechoulan 2006).
Occupational stress has been found to affect birth weight (Chen et al. 2000) and type of occupation may affect
cognitive outcomes. We therefore also ran regressions including controls for mother’s Census industry of
occupation as explanatory variables. The qualitative nature of our results does not change. Results are available
upon request.

Due to the nature of the data, based on repeated observations of the same group of people
over time, attrition between the rounds is unavoidable. Attrition is mainly due to children who
move between rounds. Only about 50 percent of the children who move are followed by ECLS.
Additionally, minority groups are oversampled to meet the study’s precision goals. ECLS
created both longitudinal and cross sectional weights for each round to make it possible to
conduct analysis based on nationally representative data.
We restrict our sample to students who are eligible in the fifth grade. By restricting the
sample to the students who are eligible in the fifth grade, we are better able to follow the changes
and patterns over time. We can particularly observe whether the magnitudes of the coefficients
with respect to birth weight change over time. Hence our sample size is reduced to 11,813
students who are eligible in the fifth grade. Summary statistics are presented in Table 2.
Dependent Variables
Reading and math standardized test scores are the outcome variables of interest with
respect to academic achievement of the children. Calculations of reading and math tests are
based on Item Response Theory (IRT), using the patterns of correct and incorrect answers to
obtain estimates that are comparable across different assessment forms.4 Test scores are
calculated based on a full set of assessment items in reading and math. Even though the
assessments undertaken are not identical in different times, IRT scoring enables tracking the
longitudinal trends in children’s learning. The reading test is based on the evaluation of the
following skills: letter recognition, beginning and ending sounds, sight words, comprehension of
4

Children were tested in two steps. In the first step they were asked common questions. Based on their
performance in the first step, second step questions were selected. Students ended up answering to different
questions based on their performance in the first step. In order to make the results comparable to each other, the
scores were calculated using Item Response Theory (IRT), using patterns of right, wrong, and missing answers in
addition to the difficulty of questions to calculate children’s score on a continuous ability scale. The computed IRT
score is an estimate of the number of questions the child would have correctly answered if he was asked all available
questions.

7

words in context, extrapolation, evaluation, and evaluating non-fiction. The math test is based
on the evaluation of the following skills: number and shape, relative size, ordinality and
sequence, addition and subtraction, division and multiplication, place value, rate and
measurement, fractions, area, and volume. The mathematics IRT average test score increased
from about 33 in spring semester of kindergarten to about 113 in the spring semester of fifth
grade. The reading IRT average test score likewise increased from 41 to 139 in the mentioned
period.
ECLS-K data includes standardized math and reading t-scores which are normalized to
have an average of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Standardized t-scores measure children’s
success relative to that of others. We prefer to use standardized t-scores to facilitate comparisons
over time.
Explanatory Variables
Mean birth weight in the ECLS sample is 3355 grams (Table 2). Similarly to the NLS,
about two percent of children in the ECLS-K sample are born with HBW while the prevalence of
LBW is approximately seven percent.
Child and family background and neighborhood characteristics are included as additional
explanatory variables. In our specifications, a large set of control variables, many of which are
commonly used in the literature, are included in regressions. While information on dependent
variables is collected in each round, most information with respect to explanatory variables are
collected with less frequency. In addition to the time-invariant nature of some variables such as
birth weight and racial/ethnic category of the child, information on family and neighborhood
characteristics collected at most once in a school year since variation in these variables, such as
parents’ socioeconomic status, within a year is very unlikely. Child-level background variables
8

are child’s age in years, race and gender. Average child age is 6.23 years in the spring of
kindergarten and 11.20 five years later in the spring of fifth grade. Family-level background
variables are the composite socioeconomic status (SES) of child’s family, mother’s age at time
of her first birth, mother’s WIC participation status during the pregnancy,5 number of children’s
books in the home, and the number of siblings at home. The SES measure, which reflects the
socioeconomic status of the child’s family, is computed by ECLS at the household level for those
parents who finished the parent interview in the related school year. Father’s or male guardian’s
education, mother’s or female guardian’s education, father of male guardian’s occupation,
mother or female guardian’s occupation, and household income are the components used in the
creation of SES composite measure. SES is available in both categorical and continuous
composite form. The categorical SES measure is calculated on a scale of 1 to 5. Average
categorical SES measure is close to 3.20 and does not change much over time. Neighborhoodlevel background variables are regional dummies and urban area size dummies.
Similarly to the NLS-CYA, one of the important characteristics of ECLS-K data is that
variation over time is very limited for explanatory variables. Hence, even though we have data
for the same individuals over time, because of the lack of variation in the explanatory variables,
the use of fixed effects estimation techniques is limited. Furthermore, even if there were
variation in the explanatory variables, because birth weight is a fixed variable, fixed effects panel
data estimation techniques are not feasible to employ for our analysis.

Women, Infants and Children (WIC) is a program providing Federal grants to States for supplemental foods, health
care referrals, and nutrition education for low-income pregnant, breastfeeding, and non-breastfeeding postpartum
women, and to infants and children up to age five who are found to be at nutritional risk.

V. EMPIRICAL IMPLEMENTATION
For both data sets, our dependent variables of interest are cognitive outcomes. To
investigate the effect that birth weight has on various measures of cognitive outcomes, the
following equation is estimated:
CognitiveOutcome = α 0 + α 1 BirthWeight + α 2 BirthWeight 2 + α 3 X + α 4 (region) + ε (1)

where CognitiveOutcome represents one of the following: PPVT score, math score, or reading
score; X includes personal, parental, and demographic characteristics; region represents
indicators for Census region of residence; and ε is an error term. A quadratic term for birth
weight is included to account for the likelihood that an additional unit at higher levels will have
less of an effect on the dependent variable as that of an additional unit at lower levels. Our
hypothesis is that at a birth weight of approximately 4500 grams, cognitive outcomes may start
to decrease with increasing birth weight. Sampling weights are not employed in regressions as
exogenous stratification obviates the need for them (DuMouchel and Duncan 1983; Maddala
1983), yet the qualitative nature of the results does not change when weights are employed.
A potential concern with estimating equation (1) is that unobserved characteristics
common to both birth weight and cognitive outcomes are not controlled for; in particular, birth
weight may be strongly correlated with the error term ε . In order to address this, we use an
instrumental variables approach and exploit information on the mother’s behavior during
pregnancy with the child in the NLSY-CYA. Gestational age has rarely been considered in
previous studies. (Thus, the effect of intrauterine growth retardation cannot be disentangled
from that of preterm delivery.) We consider gestation in our IV regressions, in addition to

10

information on prenatal care,6 mother’s weight gain during pregnancy7 and mother’s age at the
time the child was born.
There are two common sources of endogeneity undermining the credibility of ordinary
least squares (OLS) estimates. The first one is reverse causality, or structural endogeneity,
which is not relevant to the nature of our analysis since it is not possible for test scores of an
individual to determine his or her birth weight (BW). The second is omitted variables bias that
arises due to unobserved heterogeneity, or statistical endogeneity. That is, when a third
unobservable factor related to someone’s personal characteristics such as SES but not included in
the estimations, determines both the variable of interest and the dependent variable, OLS may
lead to biased estimates. In our case, if personal characteristics are affecting a child’s BW as
well as test outcomes, then our results would be biased. The literature examining the impact of
LBW on various outcomes stresses that LBW is correlated with low SES. Hence, studies which
do not control for the endogeneity of LBW may lead to biased estimates.
Aside from IV approaches, one method used in dealing with endogeneity with respect to
the impact of LBW is to use a monogenic twin sample. Since it is assumed that monogenic twins
share identical background characteristics, the difference in their BW, caused by their random
positioning in the womb, determines their access to nutrition during gestation. The lucky twin
has a better position in the womb and receives better nutrition and therefore is born with a higher
BW. Hence, if an estimate of twin fixed effects of the difference in BW is statistically
significant with a positive sign, then this shows that LBW babies are disadvantaged in

6

There is evidence that selection bias in estimating the effect of prenatal care on birth weight does not operate in the
expected direction; i.e., OLS underestimates the effects of prenatal care and there is evidence of adverse selection in
this context (Joyce 1994).
7
Weight gain during pregnancy has been found to be associated with complications during pregnancy (Kiel et al.
2007) and may lead to gestational diabetes, which increases the probability of high birth weight.

11

comparison to HBW babies. Another way to deal with this particular problem is to undertake a
sibling fixed methodology, which makes similar assumptions for the siblings.
Certain limitations make it difficult to utilize such methodologies for our study using the
ECLS-K, which has limited information on mothers compared to the NLS-CYA. A twin sample
is particularly uninteresting for our purposes since twins on average are born with a lower BW
than non-twins. Therefore, the prevalence of HBW among twins is very low. Similar problems
arise when we consider a sibling fixed effects methodology. The prevalence of HBW is low and
a sibling sample is quite small in the NLS-CYA; moreover, it is difficult using the ECLS-K in
obtaining a sibling sample.8 The resulting limited sample size would not offer enough variation
to undertake such analyses.
If the factors determining HBW are the same as the factors determining LBW, which is
strongly correlated with low SES status, then OLS estimates with respect to the impact of HBW
will be biased. However, if HBW is determined by other factors and somewhat free from SES,
then OLS estimates may be reliable. Our instruments reflect determinants of LBW, but even
using IV approaches, Hausman endogeneity tests indicate that OLS estimates are consistent for
the most part. Appendix B shows the relationship between categorical SES, and HBW and LBW
status. For LBW as SES category increases, the prevalence of LBW decreases. For HBW the
relationship is unclear. Prevalence of HBW oscillates as SES category changes. Using
categories of education for the NLS-CYA sample, we see a similar pattern emerge: a steadily
declining percentage of those with LBW as education category increases but an unclear
relationship for HBW. Thus, HBW does not seem to be correlated with SES. This suggests that

8

ECLS-K consists of a cohort of students followed over time. Unless there are a few grade repeating students, the
only way for any two students to have the same mother is to have a twin sibling. Therefore, a sibling fixed
methodology is impossible to undertake using ECLS-K data.

12

the source of endogeneity for LBW may not be as major a concern for HBW as the independent
variable.
These findings have two important implications. First, for our purposes, relying on OLS
estimates may not be a bad strategy since the presence of HBW appears to be free of classical
sources of endogeneity. Second, an endeavor to uncover the determinants of HBW would
produce a meaningful contribution to the literature.
VI. RESULTS
Table 3 presents OLS results for the NLS-CYA. For all outcomes, positive and
significant effects can be found associated with increasing birth weight at 2500 grams. While
lower in magnitude, these positive effects continue at the mean birth weight. Once we evaluate
the effect at a birth weight of 4500 grams, however, the effect becomes negative and significant
for all outcomes. In particular, an increase in birth weight at 4500 grams of 100 grams decreases
the average Piat math score by 0.0337 (column 2) and the average Piat reading recognition score
by 0.0388 (column 4). Breastfeeding and being a firstborn are associated with positive cognitive
outcomes, while being other than white, having a single or divorced mother, having many
siblings at home, and having a mother with a high BMI are associated with adverse cognitive
outcomes.
Results for instrumental variables regressions are reported in Table 4. These results are
qualitatively similar for the most part to the OLS ones, yet slightly higher magnitudes are found
at the 4500 gram threshold, and mixed results are seen at mean birth weight. In particular, an
increase in birth weight at 4500 grams of 100 grams decreases the average Piat math score by
0.682 (column 2) and the average Piat reading recognition score by 1.395 (column 4).
Overidentification tests suggest that instruments pass the standard test for exclusion restrictions.
13

Endogeneity tests suggest that OLS results are consistent for these two variables. Moreover, the
underlying distribution of actual and predicted birth weight appears to be very similar: Average
birth weight is 3290 grams, while average predicted birth weight is 3283 grams. At the 20th
percentile of the distribution, actual birth weight is 2863 grams while predicted birth weight is
3055 grams; at the 80th percentile, actual birth weight is 3770 grams while predicted birth weight
is 3545 grams. First-stage results can be seen in Appendix A.
Table 5 presents results for the ECLS-K where the math test t-score is the outcome
variable. Similarly to the NLS, positive and significant effects can be found associated with
increasing birth weight at 2500 grams. Again, while lower in magnitude, these positive effects
continue at the mean birth weight. Once we evaluate the effect at a birth weight of 4500 grams,
however, the effect again becomes negative and significant. In particular, an increase in birth
weight at 4500 grams of 100 grams decreases the average IRT math t-score by 0.0182
(kindergarten) to 0.0633 (1st grade). A higher SES, having more books at home, and expecting
to go far in education are associated with positive math t-scores, while being other than white or
Asian, being female, having many siblings at home, and having a mother who received WIC are
associated with adverse math t-scores.
Table 6 presents results for the ECLS-K where the reading test t-score is the outcome
variable. Similar results emerge for birth weight. We find that an increase in birth weight at
4500 grams of 100 grams decreases the average IRT reading t-score by 0.0286 (1st grade) to
0.0731 (3rd grade). A higher SES, having more books at home, and expecting to go far in
education are associated with positive reading t-scores, while being other than white or Asian,
being male, having many siblings at home, and having a mother who received WIC are
associated with adverse reading t-scores.

VII. DISCUSSION
Taking the potential endogenous nature of birth weight into account, our study provides
some new evidence on the relationship between high birth weight and cognitive outcomes.
Using two different data sets, the children of the 1979 cohort of the National Longitudinal
Survey of Youth (NLSY-CYA) and the kindergarten cohort of the Early Childhood Longitudinal
Study (ECLS-K), we find that while not as pressing a need as low birth weight, high birth weight
should not be ignored when determining the effect of birth weight on subsequent outcomes.9 In
particular, we find that if birth weight were increased by a standard deviation from the mean
(approximately 500 grams) at a birth weight of 4500 grams, math scores would decrease by
0.168 (NLS-CYA) and 0.135 (ECLS-K, pooled sample) and reading scores would decrease by
0.194 (NLS-CYA) and 0.255 (ECLS-K, pooled sample). Policies aimed at reducing low birth
weight prevalence may also reduce high birth weight prevalence if they encourage mothers to
seek proper care and nutrition during pregnancy, and thus the current benefits of these policies
may be underestimated.

9

HBW prevalence is still lower than LBW prevalence, at two percent versus seven percent in our samples.
Appendix C reveals that HBW is more of a concern for males and for races other than African-Americans.
