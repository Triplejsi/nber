Sovereign Wealth Funds: Stylized Facts about their Determinants and Governance
Joshua Aizenman and Reuven Glick
NBER Working Paper No. 14562
December 2008
JEL No. E52,E58,F15,F3
ABSTRACT
This paper presents statistical analysis supporting stylized facts about sovereign wealth funds (SWFs).
It discusses the forces leading to the growth of SWFs, including the role of fuel exports and ongoing
current account surpluses, and large hoarding of international reserves. It analyzes the degree to which
measures of SWF governance and transparency compare with national norms of behavior. We provide
evidence that many countries with SWFs are characterized by effective governance, but weak democratic
institutions, as compared to other nonindustrial countries. We also present a model with which we
compare the optimal degree of diversification abroad by a central bank versus that of a sovereign wealth
fund. We show that if the central bank manages its foreign assets with the objective of reducing the
probability of sudden stops, it will place a high weight on the downside risk of holding risky assets
abroad and will tend to hold primarily safe foreign assets. In contrast, if the sovereign wealth fund,
acting on behalf of the Treasury, maximizes the expected utility of a representative domestic agent,
it will opt for relatively greater holding of more risky foreign assets. We discuss how the degree of
a country's transparency may affect the size of the foreign asset base entrusted to a wealth fund's management,
and show that, for relatively low levels of public foreign assets, assigning portfolio management independence
to the central bank may be advantageous. However, for a large enough foreign asset base, the opportunity
cost associated with the limited portfolio diversification of the central bank induces authorities to establish
a wealth fund in pursuit of higher returns.

1. Introduction
Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) are saving funds controlled by sovereign governments
that hold and manage foreign assets. Private analysts put current sovereign wealth fund assets in
the range of $2 to 3 trillion or even higher.1 This amount is projected to grow to as much as $13
trillion in the next ten years, an amount larger than the current global stock of foreign reserves of
about $6 trillion.2 While not a new phenomenon, the recent activities and projected growth of
SWFs have stirred debate about the extent to which their size may allow them to affect financial
markets and their policies may be driven by non-economic considerations.
As an increasing share of the foreign asset holdings of SWFs shift from government debt
obligations to private equities, concerns also have arisen about how institutions in the “investing”
and “receiving” countries may need to adapt. Much discussion has been devoted to the need for
individual SWFs to be more transparent about their investment approach, by providing more
information on the type and amounts of assets they hold, and about their governance structure,
by clarifying how decisions are made and monitored.
This paper gives an overview of the ongoing debate about the expanding role of SWFs in
international financial markets. It discusses the forces leading to the growth of SWFs and
provides statistical analysis supporting stylized facts about their determinants. It also analyzes
the degree to which measures of the governance and transparency of individual SWFs compare

1

Ziemba (2008) estimates SWF assets amounted to around $2 trillion at the end of 2007. Lyons (2007) and Jen
(2007) give figures of roughly $2.2 and $2.5 trillion, respecitvely. Truman (2008) estimates that SWFs managed just
under $3 trillion at the end of 2007 (he also identifies another $2.3 billion under management by sovereign pension
funds). Definitional issues tend to account for most of the divergence in estimates. For example, Truman includes
investment funds managed by monetary authorities in Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong, and Russia. Ziemba excludes these
funds as well as SWFs who primarily hold domestic assets (e.g., Singapore’s Temasek and Malaysia’s Khazanah
Fund). Based on public ownership asset data, Balding (2008) suggests that sovereign wealth funds manage much
less than any of the numbers above; however, he ignores assets handled by external fund managers.
2
Jen (2007) projects global SWF assets will total $12 trillion in 2015; the IMF Survey (March 4, 2008) projects an
increase to $8-13 trillion by 2013. Lyons (2007) projects a total of $13 trillion by 2017.

with national and global norms of behavior. In addition, the paper discusses how expansion of
asset holdings of SWFs may affect the level of official reserve holdings. The paper concludes
with discussion of the implications of growing SWFs for international financial markets.

2. Reasons for the Growth of SWFs
SWFs have become an important class of investors in terms of the size of assets under
sovereign control. How do they compare to other pools of global investment? As shown in
Figure 1, SWF asset holdings now amount to much less than the funds under management by
mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies, $20-30 trillion each, and less than the $6
trillion in central bank foreign reserve holdings (including $1.8 trillion by China). But they are
more than the $1.9 trillion under management by hedge funds and almost $1 trillion by private
equity groups.
SWFS generally fall into two categories according to the source of their foreign exchange
assets. Commodity SWFs are funded by commodity exports, either owned or taxed by
government (e.g. the Gulf States, Norway, Russia). They have been established for various
purposes, including stabilization of fiscal revenues, management of inter-generational savings,
and sterilization of the effects of balance of payments inflows on domestic inflation. Noncommodity SWFs are funded typically by the transfer of assets from official foreign exchange
reserves (e.g. China, other Asia countries). Current estimates suggest that funds derived from oil
and gas export revenues account for some two thirds of the total assets held by SWFs, with the
rest consisting of funds mainly controlled by Asian surplus exporters.
The growth of SWFs may be viewed as a consequence of countries running persistent
current account surpluses and accumulating net foreign assets. SWFs arise as a by-product of

2

these current account surpluses in circumstances where sovereign governments choose to retain
control of the foreign assets acquired.
There are several reasons for the accumulation of net foreign assets by sovereigns and the
resulting growth of sovereign wealth funds. First, the recent commodity price boom has swelled
the sovereign asset holdings of commodity-exporting countries where the public sector controls
commodity exports or heavily taxes the revenues earned by private commodity exporters. Earlier
commodity price booms vividly illustrate the adverse effect on competitiveness of domestic
inflation and large real appreciations induced by using these windfall gains for domestic
expenditures, particularly when the gains are transitory. For example, the windfall gains
associated with the sharp rise in the price of oil in 1973–1974 induced oil-exporting countries to
increase government spending; this spending fell sharply when oil prices collapsed in the early
1980s. Consequently, some sovereigns have sought to deal with these concerns by saving a share
of the gains in SWFs. In some cases these savings are used as a financial stabilizer if commodity
prices fall and depress tax revenue declines. In other cases, SWFs serve as mechanisms to
transform concentrated exposure of public assets to volatile commodity prices into a more
balanced and diversified global exposure, thereby protecting the income of future generations.
A second factor behind the growth of SWFs is the effort by many emerging market
countries to accumulate large stockpiles of international reserves by running persistent current
account surpluses (see Aizenman 2007). Many of these countries, particularly in Asia, now hold
more reserves than needed for prudential reasons. Attempts to diversify these reserves into
potentially higher-yielding assets entail transferring them from the control of the central bank to
the Treasury or to quasi-public entities, such as SWFs, with the mandate to pursue financial
strategies aiming at higher long-run returns. For example, China recently set up the China

3

Investment Corporation with assets worth $200 billion to manage more aggressively a portion of
its over $1.8 trillion in foreign reserves (as of June 2008).
Of course, by definition, the global sum of all current accounts adds up to zero. Hence,
the growing current account surpluses of commodity exporters and Asian countries are the
mirror image of the growing current account deficits of other countries, primarily the U.S. in
recent years. In this view the excess saving and accumulation of foreign assets by surplus
countries is the counterpart to the excess demand and issuance of foreign liabilities by deficit
countries. The resulting international wealth transfer from debtors in one country to creditors in
others fosters the growth of SWFs when sovereign governments choose to retain control of the
foreign assets accumulated.
SWFs are fundamentally different from monetary authorities holding official foreign
reserves, where liquidity and security issues necessitate a short investment horizon and low risk
tolerance. Central banks generally invest their foreign exchange reserves conservatively in safe
and marketable instruments that are readily available to monetary authorities to meet balance of
payments needs. In contrast, SWFs typically seek to diversify foreign exchange assets and earn a
higher return by investing in a broader range of asset classes, including longer-term government
bonds, agency and asset-backed securities, corporate bonds, equities, commodities, real estate,
derivatives, and foreign direct investment.
SWFs typically make little use of leverage, in contrast to hedge funds and private equity
funds which generally engage in highly leveraged transactions. SWFs also differ from large
institutional private investors such as mutual and insurance funds, in that although they hold
assets, they generally have no specific liabilities to be paid to shareholders or policyholders.
SWFs similarly differ from sovereign pension funds (SPFs) in that the latter, while government-

4

owned, have explicit liabilities, such as worker pensions. For this reason, SWFs typically have
had less incentive to be transparent about their investment and management practices. However,
as SWFs invest more of their assets in private financial markets, greater concern has arisen as to
the extent to which they should follow the practices of private institutional investors.
In the appendix we present a model with which we compare the optimal degree of
diversification abroad by a central bank versus that of a sovereign wealth fund, depending on the
authorities’ utility function. We show that if the central bank manages its foreign assets with the
objective of reducing the probability of sudden stops, it will place a high weight on the downside
risk of holding risky assets abroad and will tend to hold primarily safe foreign assets. In contrast,
if a sovereign wealth fund, acting on behalf of the Treasury, maximizes the expected utility of a
representative domestic agent, it will opt for greater diversification towards holding more risky
foreign assets. 3
Our model suggests that, for relatively low levels of public foreign assets, assigning
portfolio management independence to the central bank may advantageous. However, for a large
enough foreign asset base accumulated through commodity exports or foreign exchange
intervention, the opportunity cost associated with the limited portfolio diversification of the
central bank becomes high enough to induce the authorities to establish a wealth fund in pursuit
of greater returns. In these circumstances, the fund would opt for much greater investment in
foreign equities, while the central bank manages its assets with limited diversification, so as to
minimize the downside risk of sudden stop crises.
3

We also formulate a more elaborate model of joint decision making in which we treat the Treasury as the dominant
player and assume that it sets the total level of foreign assets managed by the central bank, but delegates to the
central bank the responsibility for maintaining financial stability through the composition of its portfolio.
Conditional on the actions of the central bank, the Treasury decides what level of public foreign assets to entrust to
the central bank for management as well as the composition of the residual share of the country’s public foreign
assets managed through the SWF. In these circumstances, we find that the assignment of the objective to financial
stability to the central bank tends to increase the gap between the optimal diversification patterns of the bank and the
fund.

3. Data Analysis and Stylized Facts about SWFs
In this section we provide graphical and statistical support for stylized facts about SWFs.
Table 1 summarizes data on SWFs by country, taken from Truman (2008), including the country
fund name, date of establishment, and estimated size.4 (When there is a range of size figures we
take the average; when there is more than one fund per country, we take the sum and use the
establishment date of the largest fund.) We exclude sovereign pension funds (SPFs), e.g., the
Australia Future Fund and Canada Pension Fund, since typically they have limited foreign
investment assets5 and, as noted earlier, they differ significantly in their governance structure
because of the nature of the liabilities on their balance sheets. 6 We also exclude non-Federal
sovereign wealth funds, e.g. the Alaska Permanent Fund and the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust,
since we wish to focus on cross-country differences in SWF behavior at the national level.
Figure 2 depicts the SWFs in our sample by decreasing total asset size. Observe that
SWF asset holdings are fairly concentrated, with the top six funds, accounting for three-fourths
of total SWF assets. The United Arab Emirates, including the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority,
established back in 1976, and other assorted funds, have a combined asset value of over $800
billion. Norway’s Government Pension Fund - Global (previously called the Petroleum Fund of
Norway) was established in 1990 and now holds over $350 billion. In Asia, Singapore’s two
government investment funds—the Government Investment Corporation (GIC) and Temasek—
have combined assets of over $300 billion. Saudi Arabia’s oil surplus funds, mainly managed by
the central bank together with its reserves, amount to almost $300 billion. Kuwait and China
4

We used 2003 as the establishment date of the Qatar Investment Authority, rather than Truman’s 2005 date, based
on information from the fund’s website.
5
Some SWFs do not hold foreign assets exclusively. For example, Singapore’s Temask and Malaysia’s Khazanah
Fund hold substantial domestic assets, as indicated in Figure 2.
6
We will compare the governance behavior of SWFs and SPFs below.

6

hold roughly $200 billion each in SWFs. As shown in Table 1, almost all of these large funds
have been in existence for fairly long periods, having been established in 1990 or earlier (China
is the exception).

3.A. Determinants of SWFs
We begin with simple depictions of the characteristics of countries with SWFs relative to
other countries. All data are taken from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators, 2008;
we use the data for 2006, the latest reported in the WDI, or the most recent available. Small
countries with populations in 2006 of less than 250,000 are excluded.
Figure 3 depicts the distribution of countries according to their specialization in fuel
exports, defined as fuel exports as a share of total merchandise exports. Countries with SWFs in
2007 or 2008 are indicated by dark (blue) bars. Not surprisingly, the figure shows that SWFs
tend to be prevalent among intensive fuel-exporting countries. As fuel prices have risen over
time in recent years, countries that are heavy fuel exporters have earned sizable amounts of
revenue from exports and accumulated foreign assets.7 They also have had more reason than
other countries to diversify their foreign asset holdings through SWFs.
Figure 4 depicts the distribution of SWFs across countries ranked by average current
account surpluses as a share of GDP over the period 2002-2006. (In cases where current account
data is missing, we use the most recent years or use trade balance data instead.) Observe that
countries with SWFs tend to be countries with high current account surpluses. Although many
SWF countries with large current account surpluses also are intensive fuel exporters (the raw
correlation is 0.48, the rank correlation is .37), many are not. Comparison of Figures 2 and 3

7

This presumes that imports expand by less than exports.

7

indicates that economies, such as Hong Kong, China, and Chile, among others, rank low in terms
of fuel exports, but relatively high in terms of current account surpluses.
Figure 5 depicts the distribution of SWFs across countries ranked by GDP per capita (in
$2000). Observe that countries with SWFs tend to be fairly evenly distributed across income
levels. That is, there are high, medium, and low income countries with SWFs.
What are the foreign reserve holdings of countries with a SWF? Figure 6 shows the
distribution of countries ordered by their level of foreign reserves (excluding gold) as a share of
GDP. Not surprisingly, the ratio of reserves to GDP is relatively high in many countries with
SWFs, particularly in countries that have recently established such funds. However, reserves
are somewhat lower in some countries, particularly those in the Gulf area (e.g. Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Oman, United Arab Emirates) with SWFs of longer duration.
We now turn to more formal statistical analysis of the determinants of sovereign wealth
funds. We first analyze the effect of individual country characteristics on the existence of a
sovereign wealth fund in 2007 or 2008. Table 2 reports the results of probit regressions of the
incidence of SWFs, defined as a 0-1 dummy, as a function of the (five-year average) current
account/GDP ratio, fuel exports as a share of total exports, and ore and metal exports as a share
of total exports. As reported in column (1), the coefficients on the first two variables are positive
and significant. Countries that run larger current account surpluses or that specialize in fuel
exports are more likely to have established sovereign wealth funds. This confirms the insights
drawn from Figures 3 and 4.
In terms of economic significance, an increase in a country’s current account surplus as a
percent of GDP by 10% percentage points (as occurred in China between 2001 and 20078) raises

8

China’s current account balance as a ratio to GDP rose from 1.3% in 2001 to 11.1% in 2007 (IMF World Economic
Outlook, April 2008, Statistical Appendix, Table A12.)

8

the likelihood of a SWF by 8 percentage points (0.767x100). A 10 percentage point increase in
fuel exports as a share of total merchandise exports by 10% raises the probability by 3
percentage points. In contrast, the coefficient on ore and metals exports, though positive, is not
significant.9
Other possible determinants are considered in columns (5) and (6) of Table 2. The
coefficient on GDP per capita is positive, but insignificant.10 The association of foreign reserves
and the likelihood of a SWF is positive. We will discuss the issue of the interaction of SWF
assets and reserve holdings below.

3.B. SWFs and National Governance
What about the role of national governance? Do countries with high or low governance
tend to establish SWFs?
To answer this question, we use the Worldwide Governance Indicators constructed by
Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi (KKM, 2007) which capture key dimensions of governance for
individual countries:11 These include the following six subindices:
(i)

“Voice and Accountability” (VA), which measures the extent to which a country’s
residents participate in selecting their government, as well as engage in freedom of
expression;

(ii)

“Political Stability and the Absence of Violence” (PS) , which measures perceptions
of the likelihood that the government will be destabilized or overthrown by
unconstitutional or violent means, including domestic violence and terrorism;

(iii)

“Government Effectiveness” (GE), a measure of the quality of public policies and
services, independence from political pressures, and the credibility of the government
commitment to these policies;

9

Among countries with SWFs, ores and metals comprise more than 25% of total exports only for Chile.
Restricting the sample by omitting advanced countries results in a positive coefficient for the GDP per capita
variable. Thus, among developing countries, lower income countries are less likely to establish SWFs.
11
These indicators are available for the years 1996 through 2006 on the Worldwide Governance Indicators Web site
(http://www.govindicators.org).
10

9

(iv)

“Regulatory Quality” (RQ), a measure of the ability of the government to formulate
and implement sound policies that promote private sector development;

(v)

Rule of Law (RL), a measure of the extent to which agents have confidence in and
abide by the rules of society, including the quality of contract enforcement, the police,
and the courts, as well as the likelihood of crime and violence; and

(vi)

Control of Corruption (CC), measuring the extent to which the government limits
corruption and rent seeking by elites and private interests.

These variables are constructed on a standardized scale ranging from -2.5 to 2.5.
(The data are scaled such that a 1 unit change is equivalent to 1 standard deviation of each
variable’s distribution.) Higher values indicate “better” performance. Note that the “Voice and
Accountability” subindex captures the degree of development of democratic institutions. An
aggregate governance score for each country is given by the average of the six subindices,
which we shall refer to as the “KKM governance average.”
Figure 7 shows the distribution of SWFs across countries ranked by their KKM
governance average level in 2006, the latest date available.12 The chart does not indicate any
obvious association between national average governance and the presence of a sovereign wealth
fund. In contrast, as shown in Figure 8, SWF countries appear to rank lower on the voice and
transparency measure, our indicator of democracy performance. Only 5 of 26 SWFs have
democracy levels in the top quartile; most are in the bottom half of the sample.
This finding is supported by Figure 9 which compares governance performance for
different country groupings – countries with SWFs, other developing countries, and industrial
countries.13 It is apparent that countries with SWFs score significantly lower than do industrial
countries for all governance measures, including the average as well as the subindices. However,
in comparison with other developing countries, countries with SWFs score somewhat higher,
12

We still exclude countries with populations of less than 250,000.
All figures are unweighted averages of the countries in each grouping. The industrial countries group excludes
Norway which is included in the SWF group.

13

10

with the notable exception of voice and accountability where they score much lower. Thus, while
SWF countries display somewhat better governance on average than other developing countries,
they are characterized by relatively low democracy performance.
Table 3 reports the results of univariate probits involving our national governance
measures. Column (1) of the table confirms the absence of any statistical association between
national governance and SWF likelihood with our country sample. The other columns of Table 3
report the effects of the individual governance subindices. Observe that none are significant, with
the notable exception of the voice and accountability index which has a negative as well as
significant effect on the incidence of SWFs. This confirms the observation drawn from Figures 7
and 8 that countries with more (less) democratic political institutions are less (more) likely to
have SWFs.14
Table 4 restricts the sample to developing countries only (with the exception of Norway
which is included in the sample because it has a SWF). Now we find that the governance average
and most of the other subindices have significantly positive effects on SWF likelihood.15
However, the effect of voice and accountability though still negative, is no longer significant.
This supports the fact that developing countries with better governance, particularly in terms of
government effectiveness, regulatory quality, and control of corruption, are more likely to have
SWFs.

14

If industrial countries are excluded from the sample, then the KKM and its subindices are generally positive and
significant. The coefficient on VA is still negative, but no longer significant.
15
Multivariate probits, with controls for whether a country has current account surpluses or is a fuel or ore&metal
exporter, yield similar results for both the full and developing country only samples.

11

3.C. SWFs and Individual Fund Governance
Thus far we have examined the association of national governance characteristics with
the incidence of SWFs across countries. What about the governance characteristics of individual
SWFs?
SWFs differ in their strategies for investing abroad and in the information they provide
about their activities. The Norwegian Government Pension Fund, the most transparent large
SWF, invests in a wide set of foreign industrial and emerging market securities, with significant
portions under external management. It generally has not sought out management control of its
investments, tending to have only small ownership shares in companies. Temasek, the Singapore
government’s strategic investment arm, was established in 1974. It takes long-term stakes in
local and foreign companies and tends to take a more activist approach to its investments.
Temasek has released some information about its financial performance since 2004, but the
available information has been confined to consolidated accounts that do not disclose flows
between subsidiary investments and omits historical financial data before 2001. Other sovereign
funds have been more opaque.
The degree of transparency displayed by a SWF at home and abroad has implications for
the extent and nature of its activities. In more democratic countries, political contestability
implies that the SWF agenda and investment goals should be more aligned with the domestic
electorate, implying greater demand for domestic transparency. In these circumstances, greater
domestic transparency may increase the electorate’s support for the SWF, thereby expanding the
resources delegated to it. In less democratic countries, SWF management may reflect the
preferences of a narrow power group, and the determination of internal transparency is more
involved. Too little transparency may backfire by fueling popular dissent, encouraging political

12

instability, and possibly reducing the tenure of the government and its management team by its
forceful removal from office. Yet, “high” domestic transparency may entail another cost to the
government in the form of greater discontent, inducing other power groups to challenge the size
and the mandate of the SWF. In these circumstances, greater transparency may lessen the
reported foreign assets allocated to SWF for management. In the appendix model we discuss
how the degree of a country’s transparency may affect the size of the foreign asset base entrusted
to a SWF’s management.
A SWF also may face a complex trade off regarding the degree of international
transparency it displays, i.e. the degree to which its investment strategy and holdings are
transparent to the global financial system. On the one hand, if the SWF benefits from access to
superior talent and information, greater transparency may reduce the effectiveness of any
proprietary strategy used by the fund. On the other hand, inadequate international transparency
tends to reduce the hospitality shown towards foreign direct and portfolio investment in the host
country and possibly encourage local efforts to reduce a SWF’s access to profitable business
opportunities.16
To provide empirical content to the role of governance in the activities of SWFs, we next
examine the governance characteristics of the individual SWFs in our sample described in Table
1. We first explore the question as to how the governance of individual SWFs compares with the
KKM national governance measures. To do so we make use of Truman (2008) governance

16

These considerations suggest that the degree of transparency displayed by a SWF may be determined
endogenously in an effort to maximize foreign investment opportunities. We allude to this possibility in the
appendix, but do not model it.

13

scores for nonpension sovereign wealth funds.17 He constructs 4 subindices measuring the
behavior of individual SWFs in various dimensions:
(i)

“Fund Accountability and Transparency,” which measures the clarity of investment
strategy, investment activities, reporting, and audits;

(ii)

“Fund Structure,” measuring clarity of the fund’s basic structure, including its
objectives, fiscal treatment, and independence from management of the country’s
international reserves;

(iii)

“Fund Behavior,” measuring the fund’s approach to managing its portfolio and using
leverage and derivatives.

(iv)

“Fund Management,” which measures the existence of investment guidelines and the
role of the government and SWF managers in executing them.18

Higher values of “Fund Transparency” represent increased SWF accountability and
transparency. Higher values of “Fund Structure” correspond to clearer guidelines for the
structure and scope of SWF activities. Higher values of “Fund Management ” imply more
disclosure about the governance environment. Higher values of “Fund Behavior” indicate that
the SWF utilizes more advanced investment and risk management strategies. In addition, Truman
reports a total score for each SWF, constructed as the sum of the individual index scores. We
interpret an individual fund’s total score as a measure of the quality of its overall governance. It
should be noted that the 4 subindices are not weighted equally in constructing the total score;
“Fund Accountability and Transparency” accounts for almost half of the total, implying that
variations across funds in their total governance score primarily reflect differences in
accountability and transparency.19

17

Truman also collects governance data for ten sovereign pension funds. We will compare the results for sovereign
wealth and sovereign pension funds below.
18
We have changed Truman’s actual label for this subindex from “governance” to “management” in order to avoid
confusion when referring to Truman’s total score as a measure of overall governance.
19
The maximum number of points in the four categories are 14, 8, 6, and 5, respectively, giving an overall score
maximum of 33. Hence transparency accounts for 42 (=14/33) percent of the total score.

14

Table 5 reports the correlations of KKM national governance measures and the Truman
governance measures for the SWFs in our sample. For countries with more than one SWF we use
the scores for the SWF fund with the largest amount of assets. There is no score data on SWFs
in Saudi Arabia, Gabon, and Libya, as indicated in Table 1, leaving 26 SWF observations.20
Observe from Table 5 that the KKM governance average and the Truman total score
measures are positively, but weakly, correlated (the correlation coefficient is 0.28; the p value is
0.16). The top row of the table reveals that almost all of this correlation is attributable to the
voice and accountable variable, which is strongly correlated with the Truman total score (the
coefficient is 0.56; the p value is 0.00) as well as with the Truman subindices. Thus countries
with high (low) national democracy ratings tend to have sovereign wealth funds with high (low)
Truman governance scores as well. In particular, countries with more democratic institutions also
tend to have SWFs that display more accountability and transparency.
The scatter plots in Figures 10 and 11 give further insight. Figure 10 plots the KKM
average national governance measure against Truman’s total SWF governance score for each
SWF. First, observe that there is a relatively wide dispersion in the Truman fund governance
scores plotted on the horizontal axis. SWFs in Norway, Hong Kong, Chile as well as in
Khazakistan, Azerbaijan, and Timur-Leste all score high in terms of the Truman total score
measure, implying relatively effective governance and transparency. At the other end of the scale
are the SWFs in the oil-producing countries of United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Brunei, and Oman,
as well as in Sudan, Venezuela, Iran, and Nigeria.
Second, observe that the scatter plot and fitted regression line suggest a weak positive
correlation between the KKM and Truman measures. This is consistent with the correlation
20

For the SWFs in Truman’s full sample the total score averages 15.1 for SWFs; for our sample of 26 countries,
which uses only the scores for the largest SWF in each country, the average is 19.1 Truman’s average for 10 SPFs is
29.2. For his full sample of 33 SWFs and 10 SPFs pooled together the average is 18.3.

15

results in Table 5: countries characterized by better governance tend to have SWFs displaying
better overall governance. The weakness of the correlation appears attributable to the outlier
observations in the upper left quadrant – the “older” fuel-producing countries of the United arab
Emirates, Qatar, Brunei, Oman – and the outlying observations in the lower right quadrant – the
“newer” fuel-producing states of Russia, Khazakistan, Azerbaijan, and Timur-Leste. The first
set of countries have relatively high KKM governance scores and low Truman fund scores, while
the second set have relatively low KKM governance scores and high Truman fund scores.
Figure 11 gives additional insight with a scatter plot of the KKM voice and accountability
subindex vs. Truman’s total SWF score. Here we see that the oil- producing countries of the
UAE, Qatar, Brunei, and Oman have relatively low democracy levels (as indicated by the
downward pointing arrow). Thus despite relatively high overall KKM governance levels, the
“older” fuel producing countries have relatively low democracy scores as well as SWFs with low
Truman fund governance scores, particularly in terms of transparency and accountability. In
contrast, the SWFs of the newer fuel-producing countries – Russia, Khazakistan, Azerbaijan, and
Timur-Leste, – who also have low democracy scores, have higher Truman fund scores, i.e. they
are more transparent than the sovereign funds in the older oil-producing countries. Why might
this be so? One possible explanation is that countries that have only recently begun to develop
their fuel resources have a greater incentive to foster more global integration by establishing
institutions, such as SWFs, with more transparency and accountability. It is easier to change the
level of transparency of a fund than to change a country’s political system.
Some have suggested that sovereign funds may face more issues when investing abroad
the greater the extent to which the practices of their SWFs diverge from those of domestic
institutions managing public funds in the recipient countries.

16

Further insight can be obtained from Figures 12 and 13 which present the Truman and
KKM measures for different SWF country groupings – “old” oil-exporting countries with
SWFs,21 Norway, and other SWFs. For comparison, we also report results for 10 sovereign
pension funds (SPFs) in industrial countries (as well as the sub-national SWFs in the U.S. and
Canada), using data from Truman (2008)22 The Truman subindices are normalized to reflect the
percent fraction (up to 100) of the maximum score possible for each subindex.
Figure 12 shows that the older oil-exporting countries have lower Truman fund
governance scores, primarily because of limited transparency and accountability, in comparison
to other SWF countries. All are well below the standards of sovereign pension funds as well as
Norway’s SWF. Figure 13 shows that the older-exporting countries generally have better KKM
governance levels than those of other SWFS (except Norway, of course), but lower democracy
levels. These figures illustrate how the practices of many large existing sovereign funds,
particularly those originating in less democratic countries, differ from the practices of pension
funds as well as Norway's government fund. Clearly, there is still a great difference between the
governance standards of the economies in which SWFs have been established and the
governance standards of the industrial economies in which they are seeking to invest.
3.D. Determinants of SWF Asset Size
As shown in Figure 2, SWFs vary greatly in asset size. What explains the size differences
of SWFs? Funds established a long time ago presumably have had more time to accumulate
assets. Increasing oil prices and oil export revenues contribute to national asset accumulation
over time as well.

21

This grouping consists of the Gulf countries – Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates – and
Brunei (Saudi Arabia is excluded from the Truman scores because of the lack of data on this measure).
22
The SPF sample also includes China’s National Social Security Fund. Omitting this SPF does not affect the
results.

17

The bar chart in Figure 14 illustrates this by depicting SWF asset holdings (and foreign
reserves) as a share of GDP, ranked by the duration of the fund (defined as the number of years
between 2008 and the fund’s establishment date, given in Table 1). Observe that the largest
funds are those who are the oldest – Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman,
Singapore, and Brunei. (Qatar, whose SWF was established more recently – in 2003 – is an
outlier.)
Tables 6 and 7 confirm these findings with cross-section regressions of SWF asset size
relative to GDP for the sample of 26 countries with SWFs (excluding Kiribati, Sao Tome, and
Timur-Leste because of lack of data). We include fuel exports as a share of GDP as well as fund
duration as explanatory variables
Columns (1) and (2) of Table 6 show that the size of a country’s SWF is greater the
higher the country’s fuel export revenue and the longer the fund’s duration. These effects are
significant at the 10% level or better. The remaining columns of Table 6 report the effect of
Truman fund scores on asset size. Controlling for oil and duration, lower Truman fund
governance scores appear to be associated with higher fund size (though only the effect of
“Structure” is significant, at 10%).23 These results provide somewhat weak evidence that the less
transparent SWFs are relatively large in size.
Table 7 reports the effects of the KKM national governance measures on SWF size,
controlling or oil revenue and duration. Here we find that that better national governance is
associated with larger fund size, with the notable exception of the “voice and accountability”
measure which is negative (though not significant).24 This is consistent with earlier findings
concerning the likelihood of a country having a SWF. Countries for which oil revenue plays less

23
24

The same general results are obtained with univariate regressions without the oil or duration variables.
With controls for oil or duration, the governance variables are still positive, but insignificant.

18

of a role in explaining the accumulation of SWF foreign assets tend to have better governance as
well as more democratic institutions, compared to other developing countries. Conversely,
countries for which oil revenue plays more of a role, particularly “older” oil exporters, appear to
be characterized by higher levels of governance in terms of government, regulatory, and legal
effectiveness, but relatively less democratic institutions.
The result that the largest funds appear to be characterized by relatively low standards of
transparency and accountability is part of the basis for why these funds have encountered
concerns when seeking to expand their presence in foreign financial markets.

3.E. SWF Assets and Foreign Reserves
As countries choose to entrust more of their sovereign wealth to investment funds it is
expected to affect official reserve accumulation, with funds likely shifting away from reserves
held by the central bank. Is there any evidence of such a shift?
Figure 14 plots the ratio of SWF assets (as of end 2007) and of foreign reserves to GDP
(as of 2006) in the order of decreasing fund duration.25 Observe that the older SWFs not only
have relatively high SWF asset /GDP ratios, they also have relatively low reserve/GDP ratios as
compared to the more newly established SWFs (with the exception of Qatar). Figure 15 supports
this observation by plotting the ratio of SWF assets to reserve assets.26
To examine the interaction of SWF assets and reserves more formally, we report results
of a panel regression of the determinants of foreign reserves relative to GDP over the period
1985 to 2006. The explanatory variables include reserve volatility (measured by the standard
deviation of reserve holding changes over five years), the ratio of imports to GDP, the ratio of
25

There are no reserve data for Iran, Kiribati, and Sao Tome. These countries are excluded from Figure 14.
Ziemba (2008) reports that the official reserves of GCC countries (excluding Saudi Arabia), Saudi Arabia, and
Kuwait were roughly $100 billion, $ 30 billion, and $17 billion, respectively in early 2008. These figures are well
below reserve holdings of the central banks in the region.

26

19

M2 to reserves, and the occurrence of currency crises.27. Because of data limitations the panel
includes only 22 countries with a SWF.
Table 8 reports random effects estimates of the panel with a set of year dummies and
error clustering at the country level. As shown in col. (1), reserve holdings rise with the
import/GDP and M2/reserve ratios. These effects are as expected: reserve holdings should be
higher the greater the need to cover the costs of imports and the greater the vulnerability to
liquidity crisis associated with higher short-term domestic currency liabilities of the banking
system relative to reserve holdings. Reserve holdings decline with the occurence of a currency
crisis. The effect of reserve volatility is insignificant.
Column (1) also includes a 0-1 dummy variable – “SWF present” which has a value of 1
for those years in which a country has a SWF.28 The coefficient on this variable is positive and
significant, indicating that the presence of SWF raises the level of reserve holdings.29 This does
not support the view that establishment of a SWF leads to lower official reserve levels over time.
One possible reason is that most of the SWFs in the sample have been established relatively
recently, leaving insufficient time for effects on the level of central bank reserve holdings to
occur.
Column (2) of Table 8 adds an additional dummy variable -- SWF “older” oil exporter -which has a value of 1 only for those countries which had SWFs in place before 1990 that were
also significant oil exporters. Here we find that negative coefficient. This implies that, relative to
all SWF countries, oil-exporting countries with SWFs of long duration, hold lower levels of
27

We thank Yin-Wong Cheung and Hiro Ito for providing the data for some of these variables; see Cheung and Ito
(2007) on currency crises. We also considered the use of a measure of the opportunity costs to holding reserves
(defined as the domestic lending rate minus the U.S. Treasury bill rate), but the absence of a domestic interest rate
for many of the SWF countries in our sample, lead us to omit it.
28
The value of this dummy is set equal to 1 in 2006 for any country which established a SWF in 2007 or 2008.
29
Ideally, we would prefer to be able to utilize time-varying data for SWF assets. Unfortunately we only have the
single data point for SWF assets of year end 2007.

20

reserves. This is consistent with the view that over time countries with SWFs will tend to hold
relatively less reserves.
In an Appendix we compare the optimal patterns of portfolio diversification managed by
a central bank and a sovereign wealth fund, possibly acting as an agent for the Treasury.
We first present a simple model with which we compare the optimal degree of
diversification depending on the authorities’ utility function. We assume that the objective of the
bank is to maintain financial stability by solely focusing on the objective of reducing the
probability of sudden stops.30 In contrast, we presume that the Treasury, acting through a SWF,
maximizes the expected utility of a representative domestic agent In this framework we show
that the central bank’s focus on financial stability implies that it will place a higher weight on the
downside risk of sudden stops than will the SWF. Consequently, the bank tends to bias its
portfolio strategy towards holding more of the safe asset, whereas the SWF opts for greater
diversification towards risky foreign assets. We also show how the diversification gap between
the strategies of the bank and SWF is affected by various parameters of the economy, such as the
volatility of equity returns.
We follow with a more elaborate model of joint decision making in which we treat the
Treasury as the dominant player and assume that it sets the total level of foreign assets managed
by the central bank, but delegates to the central bank the responsibility for maintaining financial
stability through the composition of its portfolio. Conditional on the actions of the central bank,
the Treasury decides what level of public foreign assets to entrust to the central bank for
management as well as the composition of the residual share of the country’s public foreign
30

We abstract from other possible central bank objectives, such targeting inflation under flexible
exchange rate regime. We also do not model deeper reasons for our assignment of objectives, such as a
possible bias towards nominating a conservative central bank governor with a narrower policy focus than
the representative agent (see Rogoff, 1985; Walsh, 1995; Obstfeld, 1996; and Aizenman and Glick,
2008).

21

assets managed through the SWF. In these circumstances, we find that the assignment of the
objective to financial stability to the central bank tends to increase the gap between the optimal
diversification patterns of the bank and the SWF.
We also discuss how the degree of a country’s internal and external transparency affects
the country’s foreign asset returns and management.

4. Implications of SWFs for Global Financial Markets
There have been growing concerns about how the size and composition of SWF
portfolios may affect global financial markets. On the one hand, SWFs are viewed as institutions
with relatively long investment horizons, generally operating with little leverage, thus providing
a stable source of cross-border liquidity for the global financial system. In fact, Kotter and Lel
(2008) show that SWF acquisition announcements raise the returns of target firms, particularly if
they are relatively transparent.31 This finding suggests that investors use voluntary SWF
disclosure as a signal of the quality of screening and monitoring by SWFs about investment
opportunities.
Moreover, during the recent 2007-08 global financial crisis SWFs have been a source of
new capital to foreign banks and investment firms, particularly in the United States. Between
November 2007 and January 2008, SWFs from emerging markets injected more than $44 billion
of capital into needy financial institutions in advance economies; these investments accounted
for roughly 3/4 of the total capital raised by target companies over period (FRBNY). In general,
they have been structured to keep individual investors' ownership stakes below the 5 or 10%
limits that would invite closer regulatory attention.

31

Specifically, they show that SWF acquisition announcements raise the risk-adjusted returns of target firms by 2.1
percent on average, and by 3.5% if they implement independent audits or make annual reports publicly available.

22

On the other hand, there are concerns reflecting the view that the growing size of SWFs
matters and that sovereign fund management may be motivated by non-economic considerations,
deviating from conventional wealth maximization. Apprehension about the size effect of funds,
both private and public, is not new, reflecting the possibility that large funds may use their
market power strategically, potentially leading to greater financial instability. An example of
these concerns is the alleged role of large private hedge funds in coordinating speculative attacks
on the British pound and other currencies participating in the European exchange rate
mechanism in the early 1990s. The extra dimension added by SWFs is the possibility that
sovereign investors may use their strategic leverage for narrow nationalistic objectives (Summers
2007, Kimmitt 2008). The concern is that financial globalization has reached the point where the
sheer size of foreign savings may distort sovereigns’ incentives, shifting them from beneficial
diversification toward zero-sum game policies. These may include supporting domestic “national
champion” firms, buying controlling positions in foreign firms with proprietary knowledge, or
increasing control of financial and tangible infrastructure abroad (telecommunication, energy,
ports, etc.).
Such developments may also lead to the proliferation of capital controls and financial
protectionism, ultimately risking international trade in goods and services. Already,
globalization, despite its benefits, has raised sensitivities around the world. In particular, there is
rising opposition in many countries to the control or major stakes that state-controlled SWFs are
taking in foreign private companies. The adverse political reaction to efforts by China’s state
owned oil enterprise CNOOC to acquire the U.S. oil firm Unocal in 2005 and by the United Arab
Emirates’ DP World to acquire several major U.S. ports are well known. More recent financial
investments, such as Abu Dhabi Investment Authority’s investment in Citigroup, have prompted

23

less concern, in part because of assurances that no control or active management of the target
firm would be sought. Emerging markets also at times have expressed sensitivity to certain
investments by other emerging markets. Temasek’s purchase of a controlling stake in the Thai
telecom firm Shin Corp. from the family of then-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra in January
2006 sparked off a political crisis in Thailand.
As a result of these concerns, a range of policies have been proposed. Some observers
call for imposing stringent transparency requirements on SWFs, well above the present
requirements on private financial funds (Truman 2007). In this connection, the U.S. Treasury has
suggested that the International Monetary Fund and World Bank play an oversight role to limit
the systemic risks of unregulated SWFs, including the formulation of best practice guidelines. In
the Spring of 2008 twenty-five SWFs formed an international working group, facilitated by the
IMF, to develop a set of voluntary best practices and guidelines (IMF 2008). A preliminary
agreement was announced in early September of this year.
Others have proposed greater scrutiny of foreign government entities seeking operational
control of companies in which they invest, particularly if they choose to exercise the voting
rights of their equity shares. Accordingly, some have advocated that SWFs should be allowed to
invest only in nonvoting equity shares (Buiter 2007). In addition, some call for restricting SWFs’
operations to reciprocal arrangements, where the ability of a country to buy foreign assets would
be conditioned on granting similar access to foreign funds (Economist 2007).
Further insight into this issue is gained by noting that economic theory suggests that the
diversification benefits associated with increased globalization can be obtained best by buying a
share of a “global fund,” composed of all the traded assets of all countries. This suggests that the
expanding role of SWFs may be best accommodated by their purchasing shares of a fund

24

composed of the indexes of all the countries forming the global financial system. Such
diversification provides the best mechanism for eliminating idiosyncratic risks. Short of
engaging in potentially destabilizing zero-sum speculation, large players approaching the size of
SWFs should not expect to get more than the gains associated with holding such wide “country
funds.”
Taking the insight provided by this benchmark seriously, a policy of encouraging SWFs
to invest in well-diversified index instruments, such as the S&P 500,Wilshire 5000, Dow Jones,
Wilshire Global Total Market Index, etc., has the advantage of providing a workable solution to
challenges associated with SWFs.32 The requirement for stringent transparency tests of SWFs
may be unrealistic, due to costly monitoring and collection of information. Channeling the
activities of SWFs into widely diversified country funds offers diversification gains to investors,
while minimizing the exposure of a given country to strategic “cherry picking,” that is,
selectively buying control in entities due to narrow nationalistic objectives. One may also view it
as a stepping stone towards deeper global diversification, as it may encourage the proliferation of
country indexes in countries that are interested in gaining from financial globalization. Such a
policy could be implemented either with the guidance of international financial institutions or as
the outcome of bilateral negotiations between SWFs and potential recipient countries.

5. Conclusions
This paper presents statistical analysis supporting stylized facts about sovereign wealth
funds (SWFs). Evidence is provided about the association of SWFs with a country’s fuel export
performance and current account surpluses. The paper also analyzes the degree to which
measures of SWF governance and transparency compare with national governance standards.
32

This suggestion was first made in Aizenman and Glick (2007).

25

We find that countries with SWFs score significantly lower than do industrial countries
for various governance measures. However, in comparison with other developing countries,
countries with SWF countries are characterized by somewhat higher governance standards, with
the exception of voice and accountability – a measure of democratic institutional development -where they score much lower. Thus, while SWF countries display somewhat better governance
on average than other developing countries, they are characterized by relatively low democracy
performance, particularly in fuel-exporting countries.
It is also shown that the governance performance of individual SWFs is weakly
correlated with measures of national governance. That is, SWFs funds tend to operate in
accordance with national norms of governance, with the notable exception of some fuel-intensive
exporting countries which are characterized by relatively low democratic performance. In
particular, older SWFs established in fuel-exporting countries appear to be relatively less
transparent, while newer SWFs established in fuel-exporting countries appear to be more
transparent. We suggest that countries that have only recently begun to develop their fuel
resources have a greater incentive to foster more global integration by establishing institutions,
such as SWFs, with more transparency and accountability. It is easier to change the level of
transparency of a fund than to change a country’s political system.
We also show how the practices of many large existing sovereign funds, particularly
those originating in less democratic countries, differ from the practices of pension funds in
industrial countries. Clearly, there is still great difference between the governance standards of
the economies in which SWFs have been established and the governance standards of the
economies in which they are seeking to invest.

26

The evidence presented in this paper suggests that over time countries may transfer a
greater share of the public sector’s foreign assets from official reserves into SWFs. The ultimate
impact that formation of SWFs will have on the dynamics of hoarding international foreign
reserves requires more data and time to resolve.
The present global financial crisis illustrates the importance of the self insurance services
provided by holding international reserves as well as the usefulness of policies that channel some
share of windfall gains associated with terms of trade improvements into sovereign wealth funds
(e.g., see the experience of Chile in recent years). While the recent drop in global commodity
prices and equity returns may have reduced the relative appeal of SWFs, a resumption of global
growth may restore their attractiveness. However, if the “great moderation” decades are indeed
over and volatility in financial markets remains highs, monetary authorities may place a bigger
weight on holding more reserves as a means of minimizing the expected costs of sudden stop
events.

Appendix: Modeling Asset Diversification by a Central Bank and Sovereign Wealth Fund
This Appendix compares the optimal patterns of portfolio diversification managed by a
central bank (CB) and a sovereign wealth fund (SWF), possibly acting as an agent for the
Treasury.
We first present a simple model with which we compare the optimal degree of
diversification depending on the authorities’ utility function. We assume that the objective of the
CB is to maintain financial stability by solely focusing on the objective of reducing the
probability of sudden stops. In contrast, we presume that the Treasury, acting through a SWF,
maximizes the expected utility of a representative domestic agent. In this framework we show
that the CB’s focus on financial stability implies that it will place a higher weight on the
downside risk of sudden stops than will the SWF. Consequently, the CB tends to bias its
portfolio strategy towards holding more of the safe asset, whereas the SWF opts for greater
diversification towards risky foreign assets. We also show how the diversification gap between
the strategies of the CB and SWF is affected by various parameters of the economy, such as the
volatility of equity returns.
We follow with a more elaborate model of joint decision making in which we treat the
Treasury as the dominant player and assume that it sets the total level of foreign assets managed
by the central bank, but delegates to the central bank the responsibility for maintaining financial
stability through the composition of its portfolio. Conditional on the actions of the central bank,
the Treasury decides what level of public foreign assets to entrust to the central bank for
management as well as the composition of the residual share of the country’s public foreign
assets managed through the SWF. In these circumstances, we find that the assignment of the
objective to financial stability to the CB tends to increase the gap between the optimal
diversification patterns of the CB and the SWF.
In the concluding section we discuss how the degree of a country’s internal and external
transparency affects the country’s foreign asset returns and management.

A1.

The Base Model
We consider the case where the authorities – either a central bank (CB) or a sovereign

wealth fund (SWF) -- determine the diversification of a given initial level of public foreign asset

44

holdings, A, between risk-free international reserves, R and risky foreign equities F, such that A
= R + F. International reserves yield a gross risk-free interest rate r0 , whereas equity yields a
stochastic return r0 + e + δ , where e is the expected equity premium and δ is a zero mean
equity-return shock. The realized value of public foreign assets in the following period, A1 , is
given by
A1 = r0 A + (e + δ ) F ; 0 ≤ F ≤ A .

(A1)

The probability of a sudden stop, φ , depends negatively on the public sector’s foreign assets, A1,
and positively on the exogenously given level of aggregate foreign liabilities, B, such that

φ = φ [ B / A1 ] ; φ ' > 0 .1 In these circumstances, greater diversification towards foreign equities
entails growing balance sheet vulnerability, where adverse equity return shocks raise the
probability of sudden stops.
The timing of the model is such that after determination of the degree of diversification
of foreign assets between equities and international reserves, the equity return shock (δ) is
realized at the beginning of the second period. This realization leads with probability φ to a
sudden stop crisis. In the absence of a crisis, the external debt B is repaid, and output Y1 is
realized,2 In the event of a sudden stop crisis, premature costly liquidation occurs, shrinking
end-of-period output and foreign assets to (Y1 + A1 )(1 − τ ) , 1 ≥ τ > 0 .3

In the background of the model agents finance long-term investment via banks, which intermediate short-term
deposits into longer term investment a la Diamond and Dybvig (1983). The economy is assumed only partially
integrated with the global financial system, hence some of the liquidity intermediated by the banking system is the
outcome of inflows of short-term foreign deposits (“hot money”). Financial integration implies exposure to sudden
stops and capital flight shocks, which may drain the liquidity of the domestic banking system. A sudden stop entails
costly pre-mature liquidation of long term investments, reducing thereby the output associated with these projects.
The sudden stop probability can be derived endogenously by allowing for liquidity shocks z to foreign borrowing
(see Aizenman and Lee, 2008). If z < A1, the liquidity shock is financed by A1, without disrupting long-term
investment. If z > A1, it leads to a sudden stop crisis associated with premature and costly liquidation of z – A1 units
of capital.
2
The model can be generalized by endogenizing the determination of foreign borrowing B. For example, in a twoperiod economy, where second-period output is subject to productivity shocks, the possibility that the country may
default in the second period with a bad enough productivity shock implies that foreign borrowing is constrained by
the condition that the cost of funds equals the expected return to lenders (see Aizenman and Marion, 2004). Y1 might
be expressed as a function of borrowing B in this more general framework.
3
This is a reduced form of the resources left following the premature liquidation of investments needed to finance
deposits and capital flight. To simplify, we assume that that A1 and Y1 shrink at the same rate. The logic of our
analysis continues to hold with different shrinkage rates of A1 and Y1, where the resources left would be
A1 (1 − τ A ) + Y1 (1 − τ Y ) , 1 ≥ τ A > 0, 1 ≥ τ Y > 0 .

Agents are risk averse, with utility U. The SWF determines the portfolio allocation in
order to maximize the expected utility of a representative domestic agent, Vsw :
Vsw = E ⎡⎣{1 − φ [ B / A1 ]}U [ A1 + Y1 − B ] + {φ [ B / A1 ]}U [ ( A1 + Y1 )(1 − τ ) ]⎤⎦ ,

where E is the expectation operator. Assuming an interior solution with diversification, the FOC
determining F is:

The lefthand size of (A4), E [ dU / dF ] , is the expected marginal benefit of diversification, i.e.
the expected marginal utility valuation of the equity premium associated with higher F,
dA1 / dF = e + δ . The righthand side of (A4) is the expected marginal cost of diversification, i.e.
the marginal increase in the probability of a sudden stop, d φ / dF , times the utility cost of lost
consumption associated with a sudden stop, U [ A1 + Y1 − B ] − U [ ( A1 + Y1 )(1 − τ )] .4
CB management is assumed to focus solely on maintaining financial stability, ignoring
the effects of its behavior on the utility of domestic agents. As long as a crisis is avoided, the CB
manager enjoys a consumption level of Ccb , and utility U [Ccb ] . A financial crisis entails a
penalty at rate p; 1 ≥ p > 0 (possibly involving replacement of the central bank manager),
reducing the central bank’s utility to U [ ccb (1 − p ) ] . In these circumstances, the CB’s expected
utility is

4

Since φ ' > 0 , note that dφ / dF = −φ ' ( B / A1 )( e + δ ) > 0 for a negative shock large enough such that e + δ < 0 .

Note also that the utility cost is positive as long as ( A1 + Y1 )τ > B , i.e. the penalty costs are greater than the foregone
foreign borrowing obligation.

(A6)

Comparing the FOC of optimal portfolio diversification by the SWF, (A3), to the FOC of the
CB, (A6), reveals that the CB ignores the possible expected gains to domestic agents induced by
diversification in the presence of a positive equity premium. Instead, the CB minimizes the
downside risk associated with adverse equity shocks, recognizing that such shocks would
increase the leverage ratio B/A1 at a rate proportionate to the equity portfolio share (since (A1)
implies A1 / A = r0 + (e + δ ) ( F / A ) ), thereby increasing the probability of sudden stops in bad
times. This suggests that the CB will opt for much less diversification into foreign equities than
the SWF.
Further insight is gained by considering a simple example, where the equity shock, δ ,
takes on two values, either δ or −δ , each with probability one half, implying mean value 0 and
standard deviation δ . Agents’ utility displays constant relative risk aversion, with a CRRA
coefficient β . The left panel of Figure A1 plots the optimal share of foreign equities in a
portfolio managed by the SWF (top curve) and the CB (bottom curve), each as a function of
volatility δ , for the case where the initial public asset position is A = 1, well below the level of
external liabilities, B, assumed to be 1.6. With the initial foreign public asset level A normalized
to 1, F also measures the equity share of the portfolio. For δ = 0.2, the SWF’s diversification
rate is roughly 87%, whereas the CB opts for a much lesser degree of diversification (about
15%). Figure A2 plots the association between the equity shock and the sudden stop probability
for the CB (dotted line) and SWF (bold line), given the optimal equity share F chosen when δ =
0.2, for varying realizations of the equity shock. Note that the limited diversification strategy
pursued by the CB results in a relatively low expected probability of sudden stops, less than 0.1.
In contrast, the greater holdings of risky foreign equities by the SWF exposes the economy to the
greater downside risk of a sudden stop in bad times, e.g. for a δ realization of -0.4, the
probability of a crisis is almost 0.3.

47

Our framework suggests that, for relatively low levels of public foreign assets, assigning
portfolio management independence to the CB may advantageous. However, for a large enough
asset base A, the opportunity cost associated with the limited portfolio diversification of the CB
would be high enough to induce the authorities to establish a SWF, treating it as an agent for the
Treasury in pursuit of greater returns. In these circumstances, the SWF would opt for much
higher greater investment in foreign equities, while the CB would manage its assets with limited
diversification, so as to minimize the downside risk of sudden stop crises. The right panel of
Figure A1 illustrates the effects of the size of the asset base on diversification choices, by tripling
A from 1 to 3. As can be observed, the higher level of public assets has a negligible effect on the
CB’s demand for equities, but induces a large increase in the SWF’s equity demand.
A2. Delegation of Financial Stability Objective to Central Bank

This section extends the base model, recognizing the possibility that the CB has a
comparative advantage in avoiding sudden stops and maintaining financial stability, whereas the
SWF has a comparative advantage in managing risky portfolios. We continue to assume that A ,
the initial foreign assets of the public sector, and B, aggregate foreign borrowing, are
exogenously determined. We now assume that the Treasury, is the dominant player, determining
the split of the given level of public foreign assets A , between the management of the SWF and
the CB, while also managing the composition of the SWF’s portfolio of foreign assets:

A = Asw + Acb ; where Asw , Acb denote the initial assets managed by the SWF and CB,
respectively. Note that if A is given and the CB determines Acb , then Asw is determined as well.
The realized value of assets under CB management in the following period are A1,cb . The
CB diversifies its portfolio between foreign reserves ( Rcb ) and foreign equities ( Fcb ),

Acb = Rcb + Fcb , implying
A1,cb = ro Acb + (e + δ ) Fcb ,

(A1’)

where e is the expected equity premium and δ is a zero mean equity-return shock for investment
in risky assets by the central bank.
The Treasury has a comparative advantage in active management of the external
portfolio, resulting in an equity premium and equity return shock ( esw , δ sw ) that differs from
those affecting the CB’s portfolio, e, δ . This reflects the possibility that the CB diversifies by

48

passive portfolio investment channels (such as investing in broad and relatively liquid foreign
stock indexes), whereas Treasury diversities by more active portfolio management, including
FDI and possibly less liquid projects, with possible exposure to higher expected returns, but with
the downside of more volatile returns (hence esw ≥ e; σ δ sw ≥ σ δ ). Accordingly, the realized value
of assets under SW management in the following period is A1,sw :

A1, sw = ro Asw + ( esw + δ sw ) Fsw

(A1”)

As before, the probability of a sudden stop, φ , depends positively on the exogenously
given level of aggregate foreign liabilities B and negatively on the public sector’s foreign assets
A1, such that φ = φ [ B / A1 ] .
As the CB deals directly with monitoring and supervising financial intermediation, we
presume that the CB has a comparative advantage in reducing the probability of a financial crisis
triggered by sudden stops, implying that, for a given ratio of foreign borrowing to assets, the
CB’s management results in a lower probability of sudden stops than would that of the SWF, i.e.

φcb [ x ] < φsw [ x ] , where φcb [ x ] ; φsw [ x ] denote the sudden stop probability if assets are managed by
the CB and a Treasury-controlled SWF, respectively, and x = B / A1 .5
The cost of delegating financial stability management to the CB is that, in case of need,
only a fraction q of Asw would be available to the CB ( 0 ≤ q < 1 ). This may reflect both the
lower liquidity of the SWF’s investment, and institutional frictions that may slow down the
SWF’s ability to mobilize resources. Hence, under CB management,

φcb [ x ] = φcb ⎡⎣ B / ( A1,cb + qA1, sw ) ⎤⎦ . For simplicity, we assume that q = 0, implying
φcb [ x ] = φcb ⎡⎣ B / A1,cb ⎤⎦ .
The diversification problem facing the CB is identical to the one described in section A1,
i.e. maximize with respect to Fc b the objective function

{

{

Vcb = E ⎡ 1 − φcb ⎡⎣ B / A1,cb ⎤⎦ U [Ccb ] + φcb ⎡⎣ B / A1,cb ⎤⎦ U [Ccb (1 − p )]⎤
⎣
⎦
One way to capture the CB’s comparative advantage is to suppose that φcb = (1 − b)φsw ; 0 < b < 1 , where b
measures the delegation gain associated with assigning the financial stability objective to the CB. In these
circumstances, delegation implies that the CB will choose a more prudent policy than the one chosen by the SWF.
The financial stability delegation to the CB makes the Treasury and SWF better off if the efficiency gains associated
with CB’s comparative advantage are sizable enough (i.e., for large enough b).

subject to (A1’), where φ is replaced with φcb and B and Acb are exogenous to the CB’s actions.

The SWF’s expected utility is akin to (A2), modified by delegating the financial stability
objective to the CB:

Vsw = E ⎡ 1 − φ cb [ Acb ; B ] U ⎡⎣ A1, sw + Y1 − B ⎤⎦ + φ cb [ Acb ; B ] U ⎡⎣( A1, sw + Y1 )(1 − τ ) ⎤⎦ ⎤
⎣
⎦

(A2’)

where φ cb is the probability of a sudden stop as determined by CB policy, which in turn is
conditional on the CB’s initial foreign asset holdings set by the Treasury Acb as well as
(exogenous) foreign borrowing B. 6
The Treasury’s problem is to determine, for given initial public assets A , the SWF’s
investment in equities Fsw and the optimal level of initial CB assets Acb , that maximize (A2’),
subject to
A1, sw = ro ( A − Acb ) + (esw + δ sw ) Fsw ; 0 ≤ Fsw ≤ Asw ≤ A

(A7)

(Recall that setting Acb also determines the SWF’s safe asset holdings Asw , since Asw = A − Acb .)
The first-order condition for optimal Fsw and asset diversification by the SWF is

{ }

E ⎡ ⎡ 1 − φ cb U ' ⎡⎣ A1, sw + Y1 − B ⎤⎦ + φ cb U ' ⎡⎣( A1, sw + Y1 )(1 − τ ) ⎤⎦ (1 − τ ) ⎤ (esw + δ sw ) ⎤ = 0

(A8)

or E [ dU sw / dFsw ] = 0 . Comparing (A8) to (A4), we infer that delegating financial stability
policy to the CB implies that the SWF equates the expected marginal benefit of diversification,
E [dU sw / dFsw ] , to zero, instead of equating it to the expected cost of increasing the sudden stop
probability.
Figure A3 illustrates the effect of policy delegation on the SWF’s degree of
diversification. The bottom curve shows the SWF’s diversification pattern in the absence of
delegation, corresponding to the case depicted in the left panel of A1 (with the same parameter
values, including a =20). The top curve (labeled “SWF, CB delegation”) corresponds to the

SWF’s diversification pattern with the same asset base ( Asw = 1 ), in circumstances where the CB
is assigned the objective of minimizing the probability of a sudden stop (for the case where
Acb = 1 , a = 10). With delegation, for any given volatility of returns, the SWF chooses to hold a
higher level of foreign equity assets, implying greater diversification.
Our framework also implies that, as part of its optimal portfolio policy, the Treasury
determines the CB’s initial foreign assets, Acb . The discussion above implies that, above a
threshold of foreign assets A, marginal increases in A lead to greater asset allocation by the
Treasury to the SWF. This holds trivially as the probability of sudden stop, φ cb , approaches
zero.
More generally, the first-order condition determining Acb is:

A3. Domestic and External Transparency

We conclude with a short discussion about the impact of transparency on the behavior of
a SWF. We denote domestic and international transparency indices by tdom , tintl , respectively.
Domestic transparency determines the opaqueness of the SWF to domestic tax payers. If greater
domestic transparency increase the median voter’s support for the SWF, greater resources may
be delegated to it, implying A = A[ tdom ] , A ' > 0 .8

In less democratic countries, SWF

management may reflect the preferences of a narrow power group, and the determination of
internal transparency is more involved. Too little transparency may backfire by fueling popular
dissent, encouraging political instability, and possibly reducing the tenure of the Treasury
management by its forceful removal from office. Yet, “high” domestic transparency may entail
another cost to the Treasury in the form of greater discontent, inducing other power groups to
challenge the size and the mandate of the SWF. In these circumstances, the association between
the resources available to the Treasury and domestic transparency may have an inverted U-shape,
A = A [tdom ] , A ' > 0, A " < 0 .9

Similarly, international transparency refers to the degree to which the holdings and the
investment strategy of the SWF is transparent to the global financial system. The SWF may face
a complex trade off regarding international transparency. If the SWF benefits from access to
superior talent and information, greater transparency may reduce the effectiveness of any
proprietary strategy used by the fund. Yet, inadequate international transparency tends to reduce
the hospitality shown towards FDI and portfolio investment in the host country and possibly
encourage local efforts to reduce SWF’s access to profitable business opportunities. This

8

In a more general framework these levels of transparency may be determined endogenously.
The Treasury’s solution may entail running “double accounting books,” where official figures may understate
actual SWF accumulations and allocations. One can model this behavior in a version of a principal-agent model,
extending Hermalin and Weisbach (2007). The Treasury, as the principal, manages the SWF, determining its
transparency. The agents consist of tax payers and other power groups. Monitoring the principal entails a political
struggle that is costly to both the principal (possibly through the loss of control), and agents (exposed to possible
violence and punishment). In these circumstances, if agents believe that the gap between the official and the actual
books is not “large,” they will tolerate an equilibrium with limited domestic transparency. The principal then
determines the “optimal” level of domestic transparency” taking into account that low transparency allows it to gain
by increasing the gap between the actual and official books, balanced against the cost of increasing the probability
of losing control.

52

suggests that the association between excess equity returns and the SWF’s international
'
"
transparency may have an inverted U shape, esw = esw [tintl ] , esw
< 0, esw
> 0 .10

In our benchmark model, increases in domestic transparency can be interpreted as
parametric shifts in A. As depicted in Figure 1b, in the case that greater transparency primarily
increases the level of foreign assets allocated to the SWF, the level of investment in foreign
equity assets raises significantly for any given volatility level δ .11 Similarly, if the degree of
international transparency increases enough to raise the expected return to foreign assets, the
SWF’s foreign equity investment increases as well.

10

SWF size also may play an important role: limited transparency by larger funds may encourage greater hostility to
investment in foreign markets, possibly owing to the fear that a large player may use its market clout strategically,
such as for mercantilist trade goals.
11
In our framework with responsibility for financial stability delegated to the central bank, the Treasury sets Acb ,
given A, while the CB determines Fcb , given Acb . But setting Acb also determines the SWF’s safe asset holdings Asw ,
since Asw = A − Acb . In this case Asw depends on tdom only through A: an increase in domestic transparency that
results in greater initial public foreign entrusted to the Treasury also is associated with greater assets entrusted to the
sovereign wealth fund.
