Introduction

The following article discusses a large database of scientific papers, assembled and
processed over a period of time, which might prove useful in understanding the role of
science in the economy. The study of science is interwoven with the study of industrial
innovation (Jaffe, 1989; Adams, 1990; Mansfield, 1991). Furthermore, it is clearly in the
air that the economic role of science, measured by its role in commercialization, has
increased markedly during the 20th and 21st centuries (Audretsch and Stephan, 1996;
Narin, Hamilton, and Olivastro, 1997; Zucker, Darby, and Brewer, 1998; Adams, Chiang,
and Starkey, 2001), suggesting that a country’s scientific research is increasingly a key to
growth. At the same time, the precise role of science in industrial invention and new
product development remains largely unknown. Given the differences between scientific
discovery and industrial innovation, controversy continues to surround the question as to
whether the knowledge contained in papers matters to the same degree as the scientific
training and human capital of industrial researchers. We hope that the database described
in these pages will contribute to an eventual resolution of this and other puzzles
concerning the economic role of science.
We refer to the collection of files and data as the NBER-Rensselaer Scientific Papers
Database. Included are more than two million papers, written to varying degrees in the
United States during 1981-1999, as well as citations made to and received by the papers.
The institutions whose scientists and engineers author the papers consist of top U.S.
universities and R&D-performing firms. The data also include collaborations between
scientific institutions. This is significant because co-authorships typically indicate large
investments of time and resources in the production of scientific research. Finally, the

data incorporate our efforts to fractionalize papers and citations, thereby reflecting
collaborative research and avoiding multiple counting of scientific output in the economy
as a whole.
Questions that the data could be used to address include the following: Who thinks
about whose research, and in what fields? Who works with whom, and Why does this
happen? What are the effects of thinking about and working with other scientists and
engineers on invention and real output? How do these behaviors and their outcomes
change over time?
This project originated in conversations between one of us (Adams) and the late Zvi
Griliches as to how one might undertake database construction on the economics of
science that would promote research on the topic at the NBER and elsewhere. It was an
honor to be recruited in this way by so peerless an economist, as those who know best
must realize. Later, Adams was fortunate in bringing Clemmons on board. Clemmons’
skill in handling data, his insistence on asking the right questions, and his work ethic
have kept the project going when it would otherwise have ended badly.
In many ways the project was intended to parallel and complement the research on
patents that had been ongoing at NBER over a period of time, as this is reflected first in
Griliches (1986) and later in Jaffe and Trajtenberg (2002). It was immediately
understood that the project would be risky and that it would not be fashionable. The idea
of working with citations is of course, not new. To our knowledge, maps that link
industries together go back to at least Terleckyj (1974) and Scherer (1982a, b). However,
the development of citations in economics to measure the importance of ideas and their

2

flow is contained in the work of Trajtenberg (1990) on CT scanner patents and the
compendium of work in Jaffe and Trajtenberg (2002).
Papers that have used the data include Adams, Clemmons and Stephan (2004 and
forthcoming 2006; and 2006), Adams, Black, Clemmons, and Stephan (2005); and
Adams and Clemmons (2008a, 2008b; and forthcoming 2009). The reader may find
additional information concerning the data in these papers.
The rest of the paper consists of three sections. Section II describes the data from
several perspectives. In part A. of the section we discuss the form and function of the
files comprising the database. Part B. discusses the distribution of papers by fields of
science, and it does so separately for the top 110 U.S. universities and the top 200 U.S.
R&D-performing firms. The papers data are graphed in Part C., the citations data are
graphed in Part D., and finally, Part E. presents graphs of the collaborations data. Section
III is a discussion and assessment of limitations and strengths of the data. Section IV
concludes.

Description of the Database 1
A. The File System
The database consists of eight files. Table 1 provides an overview, listing file

names, numbers of observations, and file functions. We shall keep referring to this table
as a means of organizing our tour of the data. The eight files are a careful reworking of
archival data from Thomson-Reuters on scientific papers and citations. Arranged by
publication date their time period is January 1, 1981 to December 31, 1999. The data
begin in 1981, because in this year the company implemented a new and more
comprehensive data processing system that is not entirely incompatible with earlier data.

The data end in 1999, because during the subsequent extraction process for the project,
1999 was the latest full year available.
The information specifically derive from Thomson-Reuters’ Current Contents
database, which at the time covered an expanding set of 5,507 journals across the
sciences2. In addition, we use a set of 1,630 discontinued or renamed journals that were
cited by Current Contents journals. Originally included are 2,836,700 scientific papers
written in one or more of the Top 110 U.S. Universities, as well as 238,277 papers
written in one or more of the Top 200 U.S. R&D Firms. Some overlap takes place
between the universities and firms, because of scientific collaboration between
institutions. A total of 21,386,007 citation pairs occur between groups of papers defined
by citing and cited institutions, fields (defined below), and years3. Likewise 797,348
collaboration pairs occur between groups of papers, defined by collaborating and
collaborated pairs of institutions, in turn arranged by field and year4.
The designation of Top 110 University is Thomson-Reuters’. It is based on
publication volume, and indeed these universities account for the majority of academic
papers written in the U.S. The list of Top 110 universities appears as Table A.1 of the
Appendix.
The designation of Top 200 Firm was developed for this study. With one
exception it refers to the 200 publicly traded corporations who performed the most R&D
in 1998, that were based in the United States, for which histories of reasonable length
2

At the start of the project, the consulting group in Evaluative Bibliometrics at Thomson-Reuters was
known as the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI). We shall use this original name for the company
from time to time.

Put differently, the 21,386,007 citation pairs represent counts of citations at the six-dimensional level of
citing and cited institutions, fields, and years. We discuss this in more detail below.
4
Since papers are assigned to fields and years according to the journal where they appear, collaborations
occur in the same field and year. This leads to a four-dimensional file classified by field, year, and
collaborating and collaborated institutions.

could be constructed. The one exception is Bell Communications Research (Bell CORE;
ticker BELLC), which spins off from AT&T in 1984. The list of Top 200 R&D firms
appears as Table A.2 of the Appendix.
Divestiture (and acquisition) can change the nature and amount of scientific
research in a firm. We note two major examples of this in the data. Table A.3 discusses
the treatment of the AT&T and General Motors families of firms, for which the
divestiture problem is paramount. This is because, for General Motors and AT&T,
divestiture significantly alters the practice of science and R&D in each firm. Note that
we treat papers and citations of Lucent (Bell Laboratories) and Bell Communications
Research as separate from AT&T in all years and that we treat papers of Delphi
Automotive Systems as separate from General Motors in all years. This strategy allows
the user to construct the definition of the firm that is most suitable for them. One such
definition, which we have used in our papers, retains spinoffs prior to divestiture as
divisions of the main firm, and afterwards treats them as separate firms.
As we have said, Table 1 is an overview of the database. We discuss the eight
files in order of their appearance. The first file, UNIVERSITIES, is described in Table 2.
It includes three variables: STANDALONE, an indicator variable equal to one if a
university is a standalone campus or zero if it is a multi-campus system; UNIVID, or the
ID of the university; and UNIVNAME, the name of the university in NSF’s CASPAR
database. UNIVID is the modified Federal FICE Code for a given university. In its
original sense, the FICE code is an identifier assigned by the Federal Interagency
Committee on Education (FICE). As with any identification scheme, though, the coding
system adjusts to suit the users. Our version of the FICE code harmonizes with the

5

CASPAR database of universities, a collection of university data assembled by the
National Science Foundation. Thomson-Reuters also uses the CASPAR definitions of
standalone campuses and university systems in building its institutional dictionaries for
the Top 110 universities. The CASPAR FICE codes and university definitions are the
ones used in the database.
The top 110 universities include 26 university systems. For these 26 universities
the file UNIVERSITY_SYSTEMS includes three variables: BRANCH, the name of the
branch campus included in each system; UNIVID, the university ID; and UNIVNAME,
the university name. Since there are 142 branch campuses in the 26 systems, the average
number of branches is 5.5. Table 3 describes the file UNIVERSITY_SYSTEMS.
The third file, UNIVERSITY_DESCRIPTION, summarizes the paper and citation
statistics for the 110 universities. Table 4 shows that these statistics are arranged by
university (UNIVID), Thomson-Reuters ISI 88 science field (ISI88), and publication year
(YEAR). The number of observations is 143,119. Besides UNIVID, ISI88, and YEAR,
the file includes ten variables. CITSFIRM is the total number of forward (future)
citations received from firms for a given university, field, and year. The citations occur
from the publication year through 1999. CITSFIRM is a citation window of variable
length. The window shortens as publication year approaches 1999, so that forward
citations, because they are right-truncated, must eventually decline. CITSFIRM5 is the
number of forward citations received from firms starting with the year of publication and
including the next four years. Since CITSFIRM5 is a fixed five-year window of citations
and the data end in 1995, it is not defined after 1995. CITSFIRM5 has the advantage of

6

being a fixed window, but it has the disadvantage of truncating citations received,
especially for longer-lived papers.
CITSUNIV is the total number of forward citations received from other
universities arranged by cited university, field, and year. The citations occur from the
publication year through 1999. Since the citation window contracts as the publication
year approaches 1999, CITSUNIV eventually declines. CITSUNIV5 is the number of
forward citations received from other universities, starting with year of publication and
including the next four. Since CITSUNIV5 is a fixed five-year window, it is not defined
after 1995. CITSUNIV and CITSUNIV5 exclude institutional self-citations from a
university to itself.
The variable PAPERS is the total number of papers written in a university, field
and year. Remaining variables are fractional counterparts to the previous variables.
FRPAPERS is the “fractional” version of PAPERS. The relationship between the two is
this: FRPAPERS is the sum over all papers of the institutional fraction for each paper that
is accounted for by the university in question, for a given field and year. To understand
this, consider some examples. If Harvard writes a paper by itself, it is assigned a fraction
of 1.0. If it writes a paper with Yale and IBM, it is assigned a fraction of 1/3. And if it
writes a paper with MIT, Princeton, Biogen, and Merck, then it receives a fraction of 1/5.
Summing over paper fractions yields FRPAPERS. By definition this is less than or equal
to PAPERS.
The same idea applies to citations. This yields FRCITSFIRM, the fractional
version of CITSFIRM: fractional citations received from firms on each paper, summed
over papers. Clearly FRCITSFIRM is less than or equal to CITSFIRM.

7

The same is true of FRCITSFIRM5 and CITSFIRM5, of FRCITSUNIV and
CITSUNIV, and of FRCITSUNIV5 and CITUNIV5. Our reason for offering fractional
counterparts to “whole” citations is simple: fractional citations preserve totals over the
entire system of universities and firms, whereas “whole” papers and citations count
papers and citations multiple times and overstate totals in the system as a whole.
The fourth file in Table 1 marks a transition from universities to firms. FIRMS
lists the top 200 companies and Table 5 describes its contents. The three variables are
FIRMID, the ticker symbol of the firm in 1998; FIRMNAME, the name of the firm in
Compustat; and SIC4, the largest four digit industry of the firm in Compustat, based on
the 1987 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) classification system.
FIRM_DESCRIPTION appears fifth. It is the analogue of file
UNIVERSITY_DESCRIPTION. As Table 6 explains, the file includes three classifying
variables: FIRMID, ISI88, and YEAR, as well as descriptive variables. The latter include:
PAPERS, the number of papers; CITSFIRM, total forward citations received from other
firms; CITSFIRM5, forward citations received from other firms in the first five years;
CITSUNIV, total forward citations received from universities; and CITSUNIV5, forward
citations received from universities in the first five years. Included besides are five
“fractional” descriptive variables: FRPAPERS, FRCITSFIRM, FRCITSFIRM5,
FRCITSUNIV, and FRCITUNIV5. Since these variables are the same as those in
UNIVERSITY_DESCRIPTION, we refer the reader to the discussion of Table 4 for
further details.
The file FIELDS appears sixth in Table 1. FIELDS describes the 88 ThomsonReuters (ISI) field codes that we use throughout the database. These are known

8

collectively as ISI88. The table maps the detailed 88 field codes into more aggregative
CASPAR NSF12 and NSF20 field codes, and describes the codes5. Table 7 lists the
variables in FIELDS. Appendix Table A.4 records field codes and descriptive labels.
In Table 7 ISI88_DESCRIPTION labels the variable ISI88. For the 12 main NSF
fields in NSF12 we provide NSF12_DESCRIPTION. And for the details of engineering
and earth science fields in NSF20, we provide NSF20_DESCRIPTION. It is inevitable
that an element of judgment should enter the mapping between ISI88, NSF12, and
NSF20. This is due to field overlap. The point is especially pertinent for the life
sciences. The major fields of biology and medicine, for example, clearly share similar
scientific research. The mapping that we offer is a compromise: it assigns agricultural
ISI88 fields to agriculture, basic biomedicine in ISI88 to biology, and clinical
biomedicine in ISI88 to medicine. Thus for example, we interpret the ISI88 field, CGX
as the fundamental biology of cancer and ONC as clinical intervention and cancer
treatment. Because of this overlap, it is important to take note of the following design
feature. Since the data are classified throughout in term of the detailed ISI88 fields, the
user is free to pursue an alternative mapping of detailed fields into aggregates than the
ones we have chosen in Table 7 and Table A.4.
The final two files in Table 1 link citing-cited and collaborating-collaborated
observations. CITATION_PAIRS does this for citing-cited observations. It consists of
21,386,007 observations in six dimensions consisting of citing and cited institutions,
fields, and years. The file includes ten variables. These are: citations made, or backward
citations (CITATIONS), and potentially citing and cited scientific papers (PAPERSCTG,
PAPERSCTD) all by citing and cited university or firm (INSTCTG, INSTCTD), citing
5

9

and cited ISI 88 field (ISI88CTG, ISI88CTD), and citing and cited year (YEARCTG,
YEARCTD). In addition, it includes a character variable, CTG_CTD, which identifies
the type of citing and cited institution, university (UNV) or firm (FRM). It follows, for
instance, that to select a sample of firms citing universities, one would apply the substring
operator to CTG_CTD to choose CTG=’FRM’ and CTD=’UNV’.
COLLABORATION_PAIRS performs a similar linking function for
collaborating-collaborated observations. It consists of 797,348 observations in four
dimensions consisted of collaborating and collaborated institutions, field and year, since
collaboration occurs in the same field and year. The eight variables consist of
“collaborating” and “collaborated” institutions (INSTCLBG, INSTCBD), ISI 88 field
(ISI88), and year (YEAR). Included are collaborations (COLLABORATIONS),
numbers of potentially collaborating and collaborated papers (PAPERSCLBG,
PAPERSCLBD), and a character variable, CLBG_CLBD, which identifies type of
collaborating and collaborated institution, university (UNV) or firm (FRM). So to select
a sample of universities collaborating with firms, apply the substring operator to
CLBG_CLBD to select CLBG=’UNV’ and CLBD=’FRM’.

B. Distribution of Scientific Papers
Table 10 displays distributions of fractional and whole scientific papers in
universities and firms6. This is done by the 12 main fields included in NSF12 in the
National Science Foundation classification scheme. Field-specific totals and percentages
are shown above; grand totals are shown in the bottom row.

6

Recall that fractional papers are the sum of institutional fractions on all papers to which a university or
firm contributes. Thus, for each paper, the fraction is 1.0 if the paper is written entirely within an
institution, ½ if it is coauthored with another institution, and so on. Again, fractional papers are the sum of
such fractions for a given “cell”.

10

Notice that whole scientific papers overstate “true” scientific papers because of
institutional collaborations. When we compare whole with fractional papers we see that
3,074,977 whole papers are written across all institutions and fields, but that the actual
total, measured by fractional papers is 2,604,324. Thus whole papers overstate scientific
“output” in the system as a whole by 18 percent (3,074,977/2,604,324≈1.18).
When we examine the university data by field, it is clear that most papers are
written in the life sciences (agriculture, biology, and medicine). Together these fields
account for 61.5 percent of all (fractional) papers. Second largest are papers in the
natural sciences (chemistry and physics) and “technology” (computer science and
engineering), which together account for another 24.8 percent. The remaining 13.7
percent of fractional university papers consists of astronomy, earth sciences, economics
and business, mathematics and statistics, and psychology, which are trace elements in the
universe of scientific papers. Note that percentages contributed by the fields of
agriculture, chemistry, and engineering are higher among fractional than whole papers.
Conversely, percentages of medicine and physics are lower among fractional papers than
among whole. This is because institutional collaboration occurs less frequently than
average in agriculture, chemistry, and engineering, while it occurs more frequently in
medicine and physics.
Turning to the firm data, we observe a quite different distribution by field. Life
sciences (agriculture, biology, and medicine) account for 31.4 percent of (fractional)
industrial papers, compared with 61.5 percent in universities. Of course, the share of the
life sciences in firm papers has increased in recent years, but overall the share is smaller
in industry. Conversely, the share of natural sciences (chemistry and physics) and

11

technology (computer science and engineering) is 65.2 percent compared with 24.8
percent in universities. Observe that chemistry and engineering take up a larger share of
fractional papers than whole papers, whereas the reverse is true of medicine. As before,
this is because institutional collaboration is less common in industrial chemistry and
engineering and more common in industrial medicine.

C. Graphical Depiction of the Papers Data
The following sections present time series graphs consisting of Figures 1-9. Time
is represented in calendar years or as a lag between calendar years. In several cases,
when we wish to present the data by sector or science field, graphs appear as multiples.
Primarily for this reason, the following sections contain 27 separate graphs of the data.
Figures 1-3 pertain to papers and are discussed in this section.
Figure 1 presents time series of university and total (university plus firm)
fractional papers on the left scale, and time series of firm papers on the right scale.
Scientific publishing slows down in universities and as whole in the United States after
1992, and it falls in absolute terms in industry (Adams, 2007), reflecting the downsizing
and disappearance of some large industrial laboratories performing basic science research
during this period, notably AT&T Bell Laboratories.
Figures 2 presents shares in all papers of science fields for universities while
Figure 3 does the same for firms. Fields appear as “strata” covering seven major areas
(agriculture, biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, medicine, and physics),
plus a residual “other” field category. The flatness of the strata for universities suggests
little change in relative shares during 1981-1999. And yet a slight increase in the share of

12

biology and medicine, a decline in agriculture’s share, and an increase in the engineering
and physics share can be seen in the university data.
Figure 3, for industry, stands in sharp contrast to Figure 2. The share of biology
and medicine doubles from less than 20 percent of industrial papers in 1981 to almost 40
percent in 1999. Computer science also gains share though from a small base. And
while the share of chemistry is stable, the share of engineering and most notably physics
decline strongly in this picture. The topsy-turvy nature of the shares in Figure 3 is due to
the rise of industrial scientific research in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, and the
decline in large industrial laboratories that specialize in natural science and technology.

D. Graphical Depiction of the Citations Data
Figures 4-7 illustrate the citations data. Figure 4 depicts counts of scientific
citations made (backward citations) and citations received (forward citations) over time.
The figure covers all fields. It combines citations involving university papers on the left
scale, with those involving firm papers on the right scale. Backward citations increase as
time passes, because later papers have more generations of earlier papers to cite. This is
partly an artifact of the left truncation of the data in 1981, since citations to papers before
1981 are eliminated. But it is partly real, reflecting the growth of fields and the growing
ease of generating citations.
Citations received, or forward citations, at first grow and then decline. This is due
to the combined action of three effects. As time passes the results contained in papers
diffuse to readers, and this causes citations to go up. Second, the relevance of scientific
research often decays, and this causes citations to decline. And third, right truncation of
citations after 1999 eventually cuts citations received to zero in this window of data.

13

Figures 5A through 5G report the four curves in Figure 4 (citations made and
received by universities and firms) separately for seven major fields. As before, the left
scale refers to university citations made and received, while the right refers to firm
citations made and received.
The general shape of the curves is similar across fields, but with some notable
differences. The date at which citations received peak varies by sector and field.
Peaking occurs sooner in sectors and fields where growth is less and where diffusion and
decay are greater, and later when the reverse is true.
Figure 6 presents lagged or backward citation rate curves by the lag between
citing and cited years. The figure covers all fields. To reduce complexity, the figure
depicts citation curves within sectors (universities citing other universities, firms citing
other firms), but the between sector curves appear very similar to those shown. The
curves depict citation rates: these are citations made divided by papers that could be
cited. It is thus a weighted citation rate, where weights are shares of potentially cited
papers7. The university data are referred to the left axis, while the firm data are referred
to the right. Note that both curves peak at a lag of two years. The university curve is
higher because the aggregate citing population of university papers is larger relative to
the number of papers that could be cited than is true of firms.
Figures 7A through 7G are graphs of the citation rates for seven major fields
ranging from agriculture to physics. Consider Figure 7A. The figure shows that
university citations to agriculture peaks in the third year after publication—slower than

7

The reader needs to be aware that entire families of citation curves exist. The particular family depends
on the level of aggregation, the sectors involved, and whether the data are weighted or un-weighted, so that
the appearance of the curves can vary markedly. All the curves shown in this article are weighted curves
that pertain to all fields within a sector or to individual fields within a sector.

14

average. The firm citation curve choppy and irregular and exhibits multiple peaks. This
occurs because citing observations are few, especially at long lags. Other features of the
field-specific diagrams are that citation rates in physics, biology, and chemistry peak
more rapidly, that citation rates in technology, defined as computer science and
engineering, peak more slowly, and that citation rates in rapidly peaking fields decay at a
higher rate and conversely, at a lower rate for slowly peaking fields.
For computer science in universities the citation curve reaches a plateau that is
almost unchanged between lags of four and ten years. At long lags the firm-firm
computer science curve exhibits the same choppiness as agriculture. This occurs for the
same reason, that there are relatively few industrial papers at long lags.

E. Graphical Depiction of the Collaborations Data
Figure 8 presents line graphs of institutional collaborations between universities,
between universities and firms, and between firms over time. The figure covers all fields
of science. The university-university curve exceeds the university-firm curve by tenfold.
The height of the university-firm curve is again ten times that of the firm-firm curve.
These size differences dictate the logarithmic scale on the vertical axis of the figure.
Underlying these differences is the fact that academic papers are ten times as many as
industrial papers. Thus, a roughly similar propensity to collaborate results in a
collaboration count among university papers that is ten times the count among firmuniversity papers. For the same reason, university-firm collaborations are ten times the
firm-firm count, where one tenth as many papers are potentially collaborating with one
tenth as many papers. Figure 8 is steeply trended, with trends about the same in the

15

different curves, but the small number of firm-firm collaborations, some of them initiated
in graduate school, suggests that such collaborations are a second order phenomenon.
Figures 9A to 9G describe similar graphs for the seven major fields of science.
The field-specific curves are in the same order as for Figure 8, with relative differences
depending on comparative frequency of collaboration across sectors. Figure 9D
illustrates for computer science. Firm collaboration counts are more than a tenth of
university counts, and thus the university-university and university-firm curves are closer
than average. Also, university-firm collaborations grow more rapidly, so the curves
converge over time. In Figure 9F, for medicine, the two curves are further apart than
average, but converge over time. These patterns and those in other figures largely reflect
field-specific publication frequency in firms and universities as well as changes in these
frequencies.

III. Discussion, Comparison, and Assessment
Having described the data, we would like to assess their limitations and strengths.
We can think of two important limitations. First, we would like to point out that each of
the roughly 7,000 journals is assigned to a single science field. This assignment is
accurate for the vast majority of specialized journals. But the method does produce
serious errors for up to one percent of journals (approximately 70) that fall into ThomsonReuters’ Multidisciplinary category, some of which are highly influential. The category
is treated as part of biology, because biology accounts for the largest fraction of papers.
To see why the problem matters, note that Multidisciplinary journals include Nature,
Science, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, and Philosophical
Transactions of the Royal Society. Clearly wholesale assignment of articles here to

16

biology is wrong. But to correct the problem would require article (not journal)
assignment to fields. Moreover, some Multidisciplinary journals really are linked to
biology. Therefore, the problem applies to less than one percent of ISI journals8.
The main alternative to journal-field assignment is to assign papers according to
perhaps multiple fields of the authors. But current practice effectively rules this out9.
This is unlike patents, where multiple class assignments are common. To carry out such
assignments would require clear criteria that would have to be acted on by a single
Scientific Papers Office, much like the Patent Office does today. In the near future
neither condition will be met.
A second limitation is that science citation data include publication date but not the
date of first submission, or even better, the date of completion of the research. Use of
publication date produces an upward bias in the observed lag between citing and cited
papers. The true lag is the gap between cited publication date and citing first submission
date. The extra “frictional” lag, between first submission and publication date of the
citing paper, necessarily overstates the lag in scientific influence. Moreover, the problem
produces greater upward biases in fields with greater frictional lags.
Science citations refer to prior literature and yet their motivations for doing so are
not always clear. For example, they could measure influence of earlier ideas or seek to
place limits on the problem being addressed. They could seek to refute earlier findings or
constitute a strategy to raise the odds of acceptance. Of these motives, the first two seem
8

Examples include Bioinformatics, Biomaterials, Biometrics, Biometrika, Journal of Mathematical
Biology, Journal of Theoretical Biology and many others.

We tested an alternative method of assignment using roughly 100,000 Harvard papers. We tried to assign
each paper to one of the NSF 12 main science fields using information on authors’ departmental addresses.
A third of the papers could not be assigned to a field using this information, leading us to abandon the
effort. More could be done on this problem, provided that across science, journals were to adopt a uniform
approach to encoding fields of authors.

most likely to truly represent scientific influence. Given negative or strategic citations of
the last two types, however, we must regard science citations as measuring prior
influence with error10.
One strong point of the database is that science citations are controlled by authors.
While referees and editors can suggest references, including them requires authors’
assent, suggesting that observed references are known to authors. In contrast, patent
citations are often suggested by examiners and attorneys and are unknown to inventors.
Suppose that science citations reflect credible investments of time in searching the
literature for useful knowledge. What would the earmarks of such investments be? For
starters, the number of citations would set the marginal benefit of another citation equal
to its marginal cost. This suggests that citations would span larger fractions of smaller
disciplines, since similar marginal benefit and cost relationships across disciplines would
lower the proportion of large literatures that is cited. Furthermore, literatures that require
larger investments of time per cited paper would yield a lower citation rate holding size
of the literature constant. Adams, Clemmons, and Stephan (2004, forthcoming 2006)
find patterns very similar to those suggested above.
While voluminous, the papers and citations data are only a window on scientific
research. Since they are truncated on the left and right in time, we lack most citations to
papers from the late 1990s, which are not yet observed. And we know little about papers
that influence research in the early 1980s since citations to these papers are left truncated
and missing. The data are limited besides by sector and country, since they must have at
least one author from a top 110 U.S. university or a top 200 firm. Citations made and

opinion on the patents, to test the validity of patent citations, answered in the affirmative, as an indicator of

received by papers wholly authored in non-U.S. institutions are excluded. And so many
international interactions are left out of the analysis. But the science citations and papers
data described here are still a substantial improvement over much of the evidence that we
have had.

IV. Conclusion
This paper has introduced a new database on academic and industrial science that
covers the last two decades of the 20th century as well as a sample of the largest
universities and R&D performing firms in the United States. Basic science and applied
industrial research can and do overlap. It is for this very reason that the data described in
this paper could make a difference to economic research devoted to the study of growth
and technological progress. We sincerely hope that this is the case, and that these data
will foster theoretical and empirical research into economic aspects of scientific research,
both at the NBER and beyond, both now and in the future.
