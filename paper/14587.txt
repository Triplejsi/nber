Banking Crises: An Equal Opportunity Menace

NBER Working Paper No. 14587
December 2008
JEL No. E6,F3,N0
ABSTRACT
The historical frequency of banking crises is quite similar in high- and middle-to-low-income countries,
with quantitative and qualitative parallels in both the run-ups and the aftermath. We establish these
regularities using a unique dataset spanning from Denmark's financial panic during the Napoleonic
War to the ongoing global financial crisis sparked by subprime mortgage defaults in the United States.
Banking crises dramatically weaken fiscal positions in both groups, with government revenues invariably
contracting, and fiscal expenditures often expanding sharply. Three years after a financial crisis central
government debt increases, on average, by about 86 percent. Thus the fiscal burden of banking crisis
extends far beyond the commonly cited cost of the bailouts. Our new dataset includes housing price
data for emerging markets; these allow us to show that the real estate price cycles around banking
crises are similar in duration and amplitude to those in advanced economies, with the busts averaging
four to six years. Corroborating earlier work, we find that systemic banking crises are typically preceded
by asset price bubbles, large capital inflows and credit booms, in rich and poor countries alike.

Introduction

Until very recently, the study of banking crises has typically focused either on earlier
historical experiences in advanced countries, mainly the banking panics before World War II, or
else has focused on modern-day emerging market experiences.1 This dichotomy is perhaps
shaped by the belief that for advanced economies, destabilizing, systemic, multi-country
financial crises were a relic of the past.2 Of course, the recent global financial crisis emanating
out of the United States and Europe has dashed this misconception, albeit at great social cost.
As this paper will demonstrate, banking crises have long been an equal opportunity
menace. We develop this finding using a core sample of sixty-six countries (plus a broader
extended sample for some exercises). 3 We examine banking crises ranging from Denmark’s
financial panic during the Napoleonic War to the current “first global financial crisis of the 21st
century.” The incidence of banking crises proves to be remarkably similar in the high- and
middle-to-low-income countries. Indeed, the tally of crises is particularly high for the world’s
financial centers: the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. Perhaps more surprising
still are the qualitative and quantitative parallels across disparate income groups. These parallels
arise despite the relatively pristine modern sovereign default records of the rich countries.
Three features of our expansive dataset are of particular note. First, our data on global
banking crises go back to 1800, extending the careful study of Bordo, et al. (2001) that covers
1

See Calomiris and Gorton (1991) and Gorton (1988) on pre–WWII banking panics; Sundararajan and Baliño
(1991) for several emerging market case studies; Jácome (2008) on banking crises in Latin America.
2
Studies that encompass episodes in both advanced and emerging economies include Bordo et al. (2001),
Demirgüç-Kunt and Detragiache (1998) and Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999).

The core sample spans 66 advanced and emerging market economies in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin and North
America and Oceania; see Appendix Table A1. The extended sample includes all countries, see Table A3.

back to 1880. Second, to our knowledge, we are the first to examine the patterns of housing
prices around major banking crises in emerging markets, including Asia, Europe and Latin
America. Our emerging market data set facilitates comparisons, across both duration and
magnitude, with the better-documented housing price cycles in the advanced economies, which
have long been known to play a central role in financial crises.4 We find that real estate price
cycles around banking crises are similar in duration and amplitude across the two groups of
countries. This result is surprising given that almost all other macroeconomic and financial time
series (income, consumption, government spending, interest rates, etc.) exhibit higher volatility
in emerging markets.5
Third, our analysis employs the comprehensive historical data on central government tax
revenues and debt compiled in Reinhart and Rogoff (2008a,c). These new data afford a new
perspective on the tax and debt consequences of the banking crises (Previously, the kind of
historical data on debt necessary to analyze the aftermath of banking crises across countries was
virtually non-existent for years prior to 1990.6)
We find that banking crises almost invariably lead to sharp declines in tax revenues as
well significant increases in government spending (a share of which is presumably dissipative).
On average, government debt rises by 86 percent during the three years following a banking
crisis. These indirect fiscal consequences are thus an order of magnitude larger than the usual
bank bailout costs that are the centerpiece of most previous studies. That fact that the
magnitudes are comparable in advanced and emerging market economies is also quite
remarkable. Obviously, both the bailout costs and the fiscal costs depend on a host of political

Bordo and Meissner (2006) offer domestic debt data for selected years across 30 countries for 1880–1913, while
Jeanne and Guscina (2006) provide domestic debt for 19 countries for 1980–2005. The Reinhart and Rogoff
(2008c) time series for sixty-six countries spans 1913–2007, and much earlier for a large subset of these countries.

and economic factors, including especially the policy response as well as the severity of the real
shock which, typically, triggers the crisis.7
The paper proceeds as follows. Section II provides an overview of the history of
banking crises, with particular emphasis on the post-1900 experience. We also document the
incidence and frequency of banking crises by country and by region. We discuss the links
between banking crises, financial liberalization, the degree of capital mobility, and sovereign
debt crises and discuss international financial contagion.
Section III examines some of the common features in the run-up to banking crises
across countries and regions over time. The focus is on the systematic links between cycles in
international capital flows, credit, and asset prices—specifically, home and equity prices. The
next section examines some of the common features of the aftermath of banking crises. We
document the toll that the crisis takes on output and government revenues, as well as the
typically profound effect on the evolution of government debt during the years following the
crisis. The concluding section takes up the question of “graduation.” Specifically, to what
extent do countries ever “graduate” from (stop experiencing) serial major financial crises as they
seem to graduate from serial sovereign debt crises?8

7

Reinhart and Rogoff 2008a,c show that output growth typically decelerates in advance of a crisis.
An example of graduate from serial default is France, which defaulted 8 times on its external debt between 1500
and 1800, but has not defaulted since.

II.

Banking Crises in Historical Perspective

We begin this section by providing an overview of the evolution of banking crises
through history. To do so, it is necessary to first identify and date banking crisis episodes. Our
approach, which follows the standard methodology in the literature (e.g., Kaminsky and
Reinhart, 1999, Bordo, et al., 2001, and Caprio and Klingebiel, 2005, among others), is
documented in detail in the appendix, along with our principal bibliographical sources. 9
One dimension that distinguishes this study from previous efforts is that our dating of
crises extends far before the much-studied modern post–World War II era. Specifically, we start
in 1800. Our work was greatly simplified back to 1880 by the careful study of Bordo, et al.
(2001), but for the earlier period we had to resort to old and often obscure works. The earliest
advanced-economy banking crisis in our sample is France 1802; early crises in emerging markets
befell India, 1863, China (several episodes during the 1860s–1870s), and Peru in 1873. 10
It may come as a surprise to the reader that previous attempts to document banking crises
for the pre–World War II period are so limited. The problem is that because domestic banking
crises do not typically impinge on large powerful creditors in the international financial centers,
they do not leave the same imprint on the global press as, say, sovereign external defaults. For
this reason, we acknowledge that despite our best efforts, our chronology may be missing a
number of banking crises in emerging markets prior to World War II. 11 Fortunately, banking
crisis episodes in the developed world tend to be better documented even throughout the 19th
century.

9

See also Reinhart and Rogoff (2008a).
The work of Andrea McElderry (1976) and Cheng (2003) was invaluable in developing the timeline for China.
The Peruvian case comes from a little-known 1957 book published in Lima by Carlos Camprubí Alcázar.
11
The challenges encountered in dating banking crises are along similar lines as those faced when trying to
construct a chronology of sovereign default on domestic debt, see Reinhart and Rogoff (2008c).

The Big Picture: Banking and Sovereign Debt Crises
Figure 1 plots the incidence of banking crises among the countries in our sample (which
account for about 90 percent of world GDP). Specifically, the figure shows the percentage of all
independent countries during 1900–2008 having a banking crisis in any given year. The tally
weighs countries by their share of global GDP. This weighted aggregate is meant to provide a
measure of the “global” impact of individual banking crises. As such, a crisis in the United
States or Germany is accorded a much higher weight than a crisis in Angola or Honduras, all of
which are part of our 66-country sample.

Notes: Sample size includes all 66 countries listed in TableA1 that were independent states in the given year. Three
sets of GDP weights are used, 1913 weights for the period 1800–1913, 1990 for the period 1914–1990, and finally
2003 weights for the period 1991–2006. The entries for 2007–2008 list crises in Austria, Belgium, Germany,
Hungary, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The figure shows a three-year
moving average.

It is no surprise that the worldwide Great Depression of the 1930s posts the highest
readings of banking crises during this 109-year stretch. Earlier, less widespread, “waves” of
global financial stress are evident during and around the Panic of 1907 that originated in New
York, as well as the crises accompanying the outbreak of the First World War. Another striking
feature of Figure 1 is the relative calm during the late 1940s to the early 1970s. This calm may
be partly explained by booming world growth, but perhaps more so by the repression of the
domestic financial markets (in varying degrees) and the heavy-handed use of capital controls that
followed for many years after World War II. (We are not necessarily implying that such
repression and controls are the right approach to dealing with the risk of financial crises.)

6

Since the early 1970s, financial and international capital account liberalization took
root worldwide. So, too, have banking crises. After a long hiatus, the share of countries having
banking difficulties first began to expand in the 1970s. The break-up of the Bretton Woods
system of fixed exchange rates together with the sharp spike in oil prices catalyzed a prolonged
global recession, resulting in financial sector difficulties in a number of advanced economies. In
the early 1980s, a collapse in global commodity prices combined with high and volatile interest
rates in the United States contributed to a spate of banking and sovereign debt crises in emerging
economies, most famously in Latin America and then Africa.
The United States had its savings and loan crisis beginning in 1984. During the late
1980s and early 1990s, the Nordic countries experienced some of the worst banking crises the
wealthy economies had known in post–WWII following a surge in capital inflows and real estate
prices. In 1992, Japan’s asset price bubble burst and ushered in a decade-long banking crisis.
Around the same time, with the collapse of the Soviet bloc, several formerly communist
countries in Eastern Europe soon joined the ranks of nations facing banking sector problems. As
the second half of the 1990s approached, emerging markets quickly faced a fresh round of
banking crisis. Problems in Mexico and Argentina (1994–1995) were followed by the famous
Asian crisis of 1997–1998, and then the troubles of Russia and Colombia, among others.12
Argentina in 2001 and Uruguay in 2002 closed that upswing in the banking crisis cycle.
A brief tranquil period came to an abrupt halt in the summer of 2007 when the subprime
crisis in the United States began in earnest, soon morphing into a global financial crisis.13

12

While China’s heavy-handed capital controls shielded it from contagious currency crashes during Asia’s turmoil,
it did not protect it from a systemic and costly banking crisis emanating primarily from large-scale lending to
inefficient and bankrupt state-owned enterprises.
13
Figure 1 does not fully capture the extent of the present upsurge in financial crises, as Ireland and Iceland (both
having banking crises at the time of this writing) are not part of our core 66-country sample.

7

A high incidence of global banking crises has historically been associated with a high
incidence of sovereign defaults of external debt. Figure 2 plots the (GDP-weighted) share of
countries experiencing a banking crisis, as shown in Figure 1 and described above, against the
comparably calculated share of countries experiencing a default or restructuring in their external
debt. Sovereign defaults begin to climb with the onset of WWI (as do banking crises) and
continue to escalate during the Great Depression and World War II. The decades that follow are
relatively quiet, until debt crises sweep emerging markets beginning in the 1980s.14 It remains to
be seen whether the recent global surge in financial sector turbulence will lead to a similar
outcome in the sovereign default cycle. Figure 2 suggests that a sharp rise in sovereign defaults
would hardly be surprising.

14

Note that in Figure 2 the debt crises of the 1980s do not loom as large as the previous cycle of defaults, as only
middle- and low-income countries faced default, while in addition to emerging market economies several advanced
economies defaulted during the Great Depression and several more defaulted during WWII.

Banking Crises: An Equal Opportunity Menace
In earlier papers, we have shown that the frequency of a default (or restructuring) on
external debt is significantly lower for advanced economies than for emerging markets. For
many high-income countries, that frequency has effectively been zero since 1800.15 Even
countries with a long history of multiple defaults prior to 1800, countries such as France and
Spain, present evidence of having “graduated” from serial default on external debt.
The second column in Tables 1 and 2 highlights the vast differences between emerging
markets (notably in Africa and in Latin America—but even in several countries in Asia) and
high-income Western Europe, North America and Oceania. The third column of Tables 1 and 2
present the analogous calculation for each country for banking crises (i.e., number of years in
banking crises, according to the extended dataset developed here, divided by the number of years
since independence or since 1800—if independence was earlier). One striking observation from
Tables 1 and 2 is that the average length of time spent in a state of sovereign default is far above
the average amount of time spent in a financial crisis. A country can circumvent its external
creditors for an extended period. It is far more costly to leave a domestic banking crisis hanging,
due to the crippling effects on trade and investment.

15

We do recognize, however, that the wide-spread abrogation of gold clauses—on domestic debt—during the
1930s’ Great Depression by the United States and other developed economies were de facto sovereign defaults

Tables 3 and 4 present a different perspective on the prevalence of banking crises. The
second column tallies the number of banking crises (rather than the number of years in crisis)
since independence or 1800; while the third narrows the window to the post–WWII period.
Several features are worth noting. For the advanced economies during the full sample, the
picture that emerges is one of serial banking crises. The world’s financial centers, the United
Kingdom, the United States and France stand out in this regard, with 12, 13, and 15 banking
crisis episodes, respectively. The frequency of banking crises drops off markedly for the
advanced economies and the larger emerging markets alike during post–WWII. However, all
except Portugal experienced at least one post-War crisis prior to the current episode. When the
present wave of crises is fully factored in, the apparent drop will likely be even less pronounced.
Thus, while many now-advanced economies have graduated from a history of serial default on
sovereign debt, or very high inflation (above 20 percent), graduation from banking crises has
proven, so far, virtually impossible. Indeed, Tables 1–4 illustrate that despite dramatic
differences in recent sovereign default performance, the incidence of banking crises is about the
same for advanced economies as for emerging markets. It also should be noted that as financial
markets have developed in the smaller, poorer economies, the frequency of banking crises has
increased.16

16

As we have already acknowledged, our accounting of financial crises in poorer countries may be incomplete,
especially for earlier periods, despite our best efforts.

Summary Tables by Region of Frequency of Banking Crises, 1800-2007, and 1945-2007
Tables 5a and 5b summarize, by region, the evidence on the number of banking crises
and share of years in banking crisis. Table 5a starts in 1800. (The table only includes post
independence crises, which explains why emerging markets have lower cumulative totals since
1800.) Table 5b gives the evidence for post-1945.

Whether the calculations are done from 1800 (Table 5a) or from 1945 (Table 5b), on average
there are no significant differences in either the incidence or number of banking crises
between advanced and emerging economies—banking crises are an equal opportunity
menace. In fact, prior to WWII the advanced economies with their more developed financial
systems were more prone to banking crises than many of the smaller low income counterparts. 17
The Bunching of Banking Crises: Contagion or Common Fundamentals?
In this section, we discuss the bunching of banking crises across countries that is so
evident in the late-2000s case, where both common shocks (the bursting of the global housing
bubble) and cross-country linkages (for example, because many countries bought U.S. subprime
mortgage debt) are evident.
Bordo and Murshid (2001) and Neal and Weidenmier (2003) have pointed out that crosscountry correlations in banking crises were also common during 1880–1913, a period of
relatively high international capital mobility under the gold standard. 18 Table 6 looks at a
broader time span including the twentieth century; the table lists the years during which banking
crises are bunched; greater detail on individual country dates is provided in Appendix A3.19 The
famous Baring crisis of 1890 (which involved Argentina and the U.K. before spreading
elsewhere) appears to be the first episode of international bunching of banking crises; this was
followed by the panic of 1907, which began in the United States and quickly spread to other

17

On average, 7.2 crises for the advanced versus 2.8 for the emerging market countries (Table 5a).
Bordo and Murshid (2001) look at the period 1880–1913. Neal and Weidenmier (2003) emphasize that periods of
apparent contagion can be more readily interpreted as responses to common shocks, an issue we return to in the
context of the present crisis. But, perhaps, the bottom line as regards a historical perspective on financial contagion
is best summarized by Bordo and Murshid (2001), who conclude that “there is little evidence to suggest that crosscountry linkages are tighter in the aftermath of a financial crisis for the recent period” (as opposed to 1880–1913, the
earlier heyday of globalization in financial markets that they study).
19
Table 6 does not include the bunching of other “types” of crises, such as the wave of sovereign defaults during
1825 or the currency crashes/debasements of the Napoleonic Wars.
18

17

advanced economies (particularly, Denmark, France, Italy, Japan, and Sweden). These episodes
are reasonable benchmarks for modern-day financial contagion. 20
Of course, other pre–World War II episodes of banking crisis contagion pale when
confronted with the Great Depression (which also saw a large bunching in sovereign debt
defaults, as seen earlier in Figure 2).

The Late 2000s Global Financial Crisis
The current conjuncture is illustrative of the two channels of contagion, linkages and
common shocks. There is little doubt that the U.S. crisis has spilled over into other markets
through direct linkages. For example, German and Japanese financial institutions (and others
ranging as far as Kazakhstan) sought more attractive returns in the U.S. subprime market,
perhaps owing to the fact that profit opportunities in domestic real estate were limited at best and
dismal at worst (Figure 3). Indeed, after the fact, it has become evident that many financial
institutions outside the United States had nontrivial exposure to the U.S. subprime market.21
This is a classic channel of transmission or contagion, through which a crisis in one country
spreads across international borders. In the present context, however, contagion or spillovers are
only part of the story.
That many other countries are experiencing economic difficulties at the same time as the
United States also owes importantly to the fact that many of the features that characterized the
run-up to the subprime crisis in the United States were present in many other advanced
economies. Specifically, many countries in Europe and elsewhere (New Zealand, for example)
were having their own home-grown real estate bubbles (Figure 3). This, in and of itself, makes
these countries vulnerable to the usual nasty consequences of asset market crashes—irrespective
of what may be happening in the United States.

21

Owing to the opaqueness of balance sheets in many financial institutions in these countries, the full extent of
exposure is, as yet, unknown.

Banking Crises, Capital Mobility, And Financial Liberalization
Also consonant with the modern theory of crises is the striking correlation between freer
capital mobility and the incidence of banking crises, as shown in Figure 4. Periods of high
international capital mobility have repeatedly produced international banking crises, not only
famously as they did in the 1990s, but historically. The figure plots a three-year moving
average of the share of all countries experiencing banking crises on the right scale. On the left
scale, we graph the index of capital mobility, due to Obstfeld and Taylor (2004), updated and
back cast using their same design principle, to cover our full sample period. While the Obstfeld–
Taylor index may have its limitations, we feel it nevertheless provides a concise summary of
complicated forces by emphasizing de facto capital mobility based on actual flows.
For the post-1970 period, Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) present formal evidence on the
links of crises with financial liberalization. In 18 of the 26 banking crises they study, the
financial sector had been liberalized within the preceding five years, usually less. In the 1980s
and 1990s most liberalization episodes were associated with financial crises of varying severity.
Only in a handful of countries (for instance, Canada) did financial sector liberalization proceed
smoothly. Specifically, the paper presents evidence that the probability of a banking crisis
conditional on financial liberalization having taken place is higher than the unconditional
probability of a banking crisis; probit analysis confirmed these results. Using a 53-country
sample for the period 1980–1995 Demirgüç-Kunt and Detragiache (1998) also show, in the
context of a multivariate logit model, that financial liberalization has an independent negative
effect on banking sector stability and that this result is robust across numerous specifications. 22

22

See also, Drees and Pazarbasioglu (1998) for an insightful discussion of the Nordic experience with financial
liberalization.

22

The stylized evidence presented in Caprio and Klingebiel (1996) suggests that inadequate
regulation and lack of supervision at the time of the liberalization may play a key role in
explaining why deregulation and banking crises are so closely entwined. Again, this is a theme
across developed countries and emerging markets alike.

III. Capital Flow Bonanzas, Credit Cycles and Asset Prices
This section examines some of the common features of banking crises across countries,
regions and time. The focus is on the regularities among cycles in international capital flows,
credit, and asset prices (specifically, housing and equity prices).
Capital flow bonanzas and crisis vulnerability
One common characteristic of the run-up to banking crises is a sustained surge in capital
inflows. Reinhart and Reinhart (2008) delineate a criterion to define a capital flow bonanza,
catalogue (country-by-country) “bonanza” 23 episodes for 1960–2006, and examined the links
between bonanza spells and banking crises, employing the crisis dates defined and dated in the
Appendix to the present paper. 24
From the Appendix crises dates and the bonanza dates, two country-specific probabilities
were calculated. The unconditional probability of a banking crisis, along the lines of those
shown in Tables 1 and 2 (except for 1960–2007), and the probability of a banking crisis within a
window of three years before and after the bonanza year or years—that is, as the conditional
probability of a crisis. If capital flow bonanzas make countries more crises prone, the
conditional probability, P(Crisis│Bonanza) should be greater than the unconditional probability
of a crisis, P(Crisis).

23

Reinhart an Reinhart define a capital flow bonanza as follows They settled on an algorithm that provided uniform
treatment across countries but was flexible enough to allow for significant cross-country variation in the current
account. As in Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999), we select a threshold to define bonanzas that is common across
countries (in this case the 20th percentile).23 This threshold included most of the better known episodes in the
literature but was not so inclusive as to label a bonanza more “routine” deteriorations in the current account.
Because the underlying frequency distributions vary widely across countries, the common threshold produces quite
disperse country-specific cutoffs. For instance, in the case of relatively closed India, the cutoff to define a bonanza
is a current account deficit/GDP in excess of 1.8 percent, while for trade-oriented Malaysia the comparable cutoff is
a deficit/GDP ratio of 6.6 percent. 23. 23
24
They performed a comparable exercise for currency, debt, and inflation crises.

24

Table 7 reproduces a subset of the results a Reinhart and Reinhart for banking crises. It
presents aggregates of the country-specific conditional and unconditional probabilities for three
groups (all countries, high income, and middle and low income).
The probability of a banking crisis conditional on a capital flow bonanza is higher than the
unconditional probability. The bottom row of Table 6 provides the share of countries for which
P(Crisis│Bonanza) ≥ P(Crisis) as an additional indication of how common place is it across
countries to see bonanzas associated with a more crisis-prone environment. For banking crises,
the majority of countries (61 percent) register a higher propensity to banking crises around
bonanza periods.
We conjecture that the 61 percent figure would be higher if one were to include post2007 data in Table 7. Many countries experiencing the most severe banking crises have also run
large sustained current account deficits. These include many developed countries, such as the
United States, the United Kingdom, Spain, Iceland and Ireland.

The findings on capital flow bonanzas in Reinhart and Reinhart (2008) are also consistent
with empirical regularities surrounding credit cycles. Mendoza and Terrones (2008), who
examine cycles in credit in both advanced and emerging market economies using a very different

25

approach from that just discussed, find that credit booms in emerging market economies are
often preceded by surges in capital inflows. They also conclude that while not all credit booms
end in financial crises, most emerging market crises were preceded by credit booms. They link
credit booms to rising asset prices, an issue we turn to next. 25
Equity and housing price cycles and banking crises
In this section, we summarize the literature on asset price bubbles and banking crises,
extending it to incorporate new data on housing prices in emerging markets, as well as data on
the unfolding crises in the advanced economies.
The now-infamous real estate bubble in the United States that began to deflate at the end
of 2005 occupies center stage as a culprit of the present financial crisis. But the subprime
episode is far from unique in that regard. In Reinhart and Rogoff (2008b), we document the
trajectory in real housing prices around all the post–WWII banking crises in advanced
economies, with particular emphasis on the “Big 5” crises (Spain, 1977, Norway, 1987, Finland
and Sweden, 1991 and Japan, 1992).26 The pattern that emerges is clear: a boom in real housing
prices in the run-up to the crisis is followed by a marked decline the year of the crisis and in
subsequent years. Bordo and Jeanne (2002), also studying the advanced economies during
1970–2001, find that banking crises tend to occur either at the peak of the boom in real housing
prices, or right after the bust. Gerdrup (2003) presents a compelling narrative of the links
between Norway’s three banking crises during 1890s–1993 and the booms and busts in housing
prices.
Table 8 illustrates the magnitude and duration of the downturn in housing prices that has
historically accompanied major banking crises in both advanced and emerging economies.
25

See also Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999), who also examine the growth in real credit to the private sector around
both banking and currency crises.
26
The years refer to the beginning of the crisis.

26

While the links between banking crises and the housing price cycle have been examined in both
our earlier work and numerous other papers (most frequently case studies), this is the first paper
to provide systematic evidence on the behavior of housing prices for emerging market economies
around some of their major banking crises. The crisis episodes include the “Big 6” Asian crises
of 1997–1998, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and the much buffeted
Hong Kong.

Other emerging market episodes include Argentina’s mega-crisis in 2001–2002, and
Colombia’s 1998 crisis, which produced the worst recession since the national income accounts
were tabulated in the early 1920s. In the current conjuncture of unfolding crises, we include

28

Hungary, in addition to the advanced economies that have had recent housing market bubbles
(Iceland, Ireland, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States).27
Two features stand out from the summary statistics presented in Table 8. First is the
persistence of the cycle in real housing prices in both advanced economies and emerging
markets, typically four to six years.28 The second feature that stands out from Table 8 is that the
magnitudes of the declines in real housing prices around banking crises from peak to trough
are not appreciably different in emerging and advanced economies. This comparability is quite
surprising given that most macroeconomic time series exhibit drastically greater volatility in
emerging markets, and thus it merits further attention.29 Certainly, the first results presented
here on comparing housing price booms and busts around banking crisis dates appears to
strongly support the contention that banking crises are an equal opportunity menace.

The prolonged housing price downturns following financial crises are in stark contrast to
the behavior of real equity prices, as illustrated in Figures 5a and 5b in which the pattern of
decline and recovery is more v-shaped.

27

Historical comparisons are hard to come by, as most real housing price series are of recent vintage. We do
include in this category two episodes: the United States during the Great Depression and Norway’s crisis at the turn
of the century (1898).
28
See Ceron and Suarez (2006), who estimate its average duration at six years
29
For example, Agenor, McDermott, and Prasad (2000) provide evidence that output and real consumption are far
more volatile in emerging markets; Kaminsky, Reinhart and Vegh (2003) present evidence that the amplitude of the
cycle in real government spending is orders of magnitude greater in emerging markets.

These figures show the evolution of real equity prices from four years prior to the crisis
to three years afterwards for emerging and advanced economies separately. As the figures make
plain, equity prices typically peak before the year of the banking crisis and decline for 2–3 years
as the crisis approaches and, in the case of emerging markets in the year following the crisis.
However, the pattern tends to be v-shaped and the recovery complete, in the sense that three
years after the crisis real equity prices are on average higher than the pre-crisis peak.
One can conjecture that one reason why major banking crises are such protracted affairs
is that these episodes involve the real estate market’s persistent cycle in a way that “pure stock
market crashes” (for instance, Black Monday in October 1987 or the burst of the IT bubble in
2001) do not. 30

Financial Sector Expansion and Financial Crisis
Philippon (2007) analyzes the expansion of the financial services sector (including
insurance) in the United States, which averaged 4.9 percent of GDP during 1976–85, rising to
7.5 percent 1996–2005. His paper argues that this gain was not sustainable and a decline of at
least 1 percent of GDP was probable. In the wake of the subprime crisis, the shrinkage of the
financial sector during 2008 and 2009 is likely to be significantly larger. The pre-crisis
explosion and post-collapse implosion of the financial sector surrounding a banking crisis is also
not new or unique to the United States.
Figure 6 plots the number of banks in the United States in the run-up and aftermath of the
Great Depression. Perhaps, the bubble in equity and real estate prices also extended to the
number of financial institutions. This expansion in the run-up and contraction in the aftermath in

This is consistent with the regularity that house prices are far more predictable (i.e., inertial) than equity prices.

cases where financial liberalization preceded the banking crisis.

IV. The Fiscal and Growth Consequences of Banking Crises
Looking at the fiscal and growth consequences of banking crises, we again find some
surprising parallels between developed countries and emerging markets. Our analysis of the
fiscal consequences, in particular, is a sharp departure from the previous literature, which has
focused almost entirely on imputed “bailout costs” to the government which, as we shall argue,
are extremely difficult to measure. Instead, we will focus on the fiscal costs to the government,
particularly the huge build-ups in debt that follow banking crises. We are able to do so by
tapping the extensive new cross-country annual dataset on domestic debt compiled in Reinhart
and Rogoff (2008c). This data allow us to show the remarkable surge in debt that occurs in the
wake of crises.
That elusive concept of bailout costs
As we have noted, much of the literature that studies banking crisis episodes is fixated on
providing estimates of the fiscal or bailout costs of these crises (see, for example, an excellent
discussion in Frydl, 1999, and various papers in Norges Bank, 2006).31 At the time of this
writing, the International Monetary Fund estimates that the fiscal costs of the U.S. subprime
crisis will tally about $1.4 trillion, or around 11 percent of GDP.32 However, estimates of bailout
costs vary markedly across studies, depending on the methodology and vary even more across
time, depending on the length of horizon used to calculate the fiscal impact of the crisis, a point
stressed in Frydl (1999). 33 Table 9 presents the upper and lower bounds of estimates of the
bailout costs for some of the better-known banking crises in both advanced and emerging
economies in nearly all regions. The discrepancies across estimates are large and, in some cases,
31

See also Caprio et al. (2005), and Hoggarth et al. (2002), and Sanhueza (2001).
See International Monetary Fund, October 2008 World Economic Outlook and Global Financial Stability Report.
33
A similar problem plagues work on determining the effectiveness of foreign exchange intervention by measuring
the profitability of such market purchases or sales. The results depend importantly on the width of the time window
and implicit assumptions of the cost of financing. See Neely (1995).

staggering. Among the ”Big 5” post–WWII crises in advanced economies, the differences in
estimated bailout costs for Japan and Spain are 16 and 11 percent of GDP, respectively. Even
for Norway, where the difference between the upper and lower bounds of the estimates is 2
percent of GDP, a different way of looking at the discrepancy is to note that the upper end of the
estimates (4 percent of GDP) is twice as large as the lower bound estimates of the costs of the
bailout. Furthermore, as noted in Vale (2006), if the costs are calculated over a longer time
horizon after the crisis, the picture that emerges is even more at odds with the higher-end
estimates; it shows that the Norwegian government actually made a small profit on the banking
resolution, due to the later sale of shares in the nationalized banks.

In Norges Bank (2006) it is argued that the Norwegian government actually made a small profit on the banking
resolution.

In what follows, we argue that this nearly universal focus on providing opaque
calculations of bailout costs is both misguided and incomplete. It is misguided because there are
no widely agreed upon guidelines to calculate these estimates. It is incomplete because the fiscal
consequences of banking crises reach far beyond the more immediate bailout costs. These
consequences mainly result from the significant adverse impact that the crisis has on government

35

revenues (in nearly all cases) and the fact that in several episodes the fiscal policy reaction to the
crisis has also involved substantial fiscal stimulus packages.
Growth in the Aftermath of Crises
The fact that most banking crises, especially systemic ones, are associated with economic
downturns is well established in the empirical literature and we offer no new compelling
evidence on that score. 34 Reinhart and Rogoff (2008b) recently summarized the evolution of
output before, during, and after all the banking crises (systemic or not) in post–WWII. Figure 7
shows the advanced economies as a group, as well as the “big five” (Japan, Nordics and Spain),
while Figure 7b augments this analysis with a comparable summary for the post-war banking
crises in emerging markets. As before, time t denotes the year of the crisis. It is interesting to
note that the figures show a steeper decline but a somewhat faster comeback in growth for
emerging markets than in the advanced economies. 35 It is beyond the scope of this paper to
ascertain the longer run growth consequences of banking crises, but we wish to note this postcrises pattern because growth (important in its own right) has nontrivial implications for fiscal
balances, government debts, and the broader cost and consequences of any financial crisis.

34

See, for instance, Frydl (1999), and Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999), and especially Rajan, Detragiache and
Dell’Ariccia (2008), who examine the output consequences of the credit channel following banking crises using
micro data. We note that the cases of output collapses studied in Barro and Ursua (2008) virtually all are associated
with banking crises.
35
It is important to note that the v-shaped pattern of recovery is importantly influenced by the sharp comebacks of
the Asian economies from the severe 1997–1998 crisis. Excluding these countries considerably worsens the average
performance two and three years after the banking crisis, making the pattern look more u-shaped.

Beyond Bailout Costs: The Impact Of The Crisis On Revenues And Debt
Since WWII the most common policy response to a systemic banking crisis (in both
emerging and advanced economies) has been to engineer (with varying degrees of success) a
bailout of the banking sector, whether through purchases of bad assets, directed mergers of bad
banks with relatively sound institutions, direct government takeovers, or some combination of
these. Such actions have had in many cases major fiscal consequences, typically early on in the
crisis. However, as noted earlier, banking crises are protracted affairs with lingering
consequences in asset markets—notably real estate prices and the real economy. As such it is
not surprising that government revenues are adversely and significantly impacted by the crisis.
As noted, several studies have traced out the adverse impacts of banking crises on
economic activity; what these studies have left unexplored is the direct consequences of the
recession on government finances—specifically, tax revenues. Figure 8a plots the average
pattern in annual real revenue growth three years before, during, and three years after banking
crises for a total of 86 banking crises during 1800–1944 for which we have complete revenue
data. 36
The comparable exercise is shown for all 138 post–WWII banking crises in
Figure 8b. The patterns for the pre- and post-war samples are not identical but strikingly similar.
Annual revenue growth is robust in the years leading up to the banking crisis; growth weakens
significantly the year of the crisis and subsequently posts declines in the years immediately
following the onset of the crisis. For the pre-war episodes revenues decline, on average for two
years, while for the post-war the revenue slump extends to the third year.

36

Revenues (from Mitchell, 2003a, b, and c ) are deflated by consumer price indices; the numerous sources for these
data are given on a country-by-country and period-by-period basis in the data appendix to Reinhart and Rogoff
(2008a).

Parallels in Revenue Losses between Emerging Markets and Developed Economies
Again, the parallels between developed countries and emerging markets is striking.
Figure 8c shows the revenue declines surrounding banking crises for the advanced countries
across the entire sample, with the “big five” post-war crises also listed separately. Revenue
growth resumes (from a lower base) starting in the third year after the crisis. Advanced
economies exhibit a strong inclination to resort to stimulus measures to cushion economic
activity, seen most spectacularly in the aggressive use of infrastructure spending in Japan during
the 1990s. Emerging markets are far less well poised to engage in countercyclical fiscal policy.

41

Nevertheless, the effect of the crisis on the trajectory of taxes is broadly similar. Figure 8d gives
revenue declines around banking crises for emerging markets for the entire sample. The average
revenue drop is actually quite similar to the “big five,” although the recovery is faster—in line
with a more swift recovery in growth, as discussed in the preceding section.

Government debt buildup in the aftermath of banking crises
To get a rough approximation of the impact of a crisis on government finances, we use
the historical central government debt data compiled in Reinhart and Rogoff (2008c). It is
important to note that this is a partial picture, since the general (not just central government) is
affected by the crisis. Also, there is typically during these episodes a marked expansion in
government-guaranteed debt, which does not show up in the central government figures.

43

With these caveats in mind, Figure 9 presents a summary of the evolution of debt in the
aftermath of some of the major post-war crises in both advanced and emerging markets.

Not surprisingly, taken together, the bailout of the banking sector, the shortfall in
revenue, and the fiscal stimulus packages that have accompanied some of these crises imply
widening fiscal deficits adding to the existing stock of government debt. What is perhaps
surprising is how dramatic the rise in debt is. If the stock of debt is indexed to equal 100 at the
time of the crisis (T), the average experience is one in which the real stock of debt rises to 186
three years after the crisis. That is to say, the real stock of debt nearly doubles.37 Such
increases in government indebtedness are evident in emerging and advanced economies alike,

37

Indeed, there are some important cases such as Japan where the accelerated debt build-up goes on for over a
decade, so the three-year cutoff grossly understates the longer term consequences.

44

and extremely high in both. Arguably, the true legacy of banking crises is higher public
indebtedness—far over and beyond the direct headline costs of big bailout packages.38
(Obviously, as we noted earlier, the rise in public debt depends on a whole range of political and
economic factors, including the effectiveness of the policy response and the severity of the initial
real economic shock that produced the crisis. Nevertheless, the universality of the large debt rise
is stunning.)

V. Concluding Remarks
Countries may “graduate” from serial default on sovereign debt and recurrent episodes of
very high inflation, as the cases of France, Austria, Spain and others illustrate. History tells us,
however, that graduation from recurrent banking and financial crises is much more elusive. And
it should not have taken the 2007–2009 financial crisis to remind us. Out of the 66 countries in
our sample, only Portugal, Austria, the Netherlands and Belgium had managed to escape from
banking crises from 1945–2007. During 2008, however, even three of these four countries were
among those engaged in massive bailouts as the current global financial crisis evolves.
Indeed, the wave of financial crises that began with the onset of the subprime crisis in the
United States in 2007 has dispelled any prior notion among academics, market participants, or
policymakers that acute financial crises are either a thing of the past or relegated to the “volatile”
emerging markets. The “this time is different syndrome” has been alive and well in the United
States, where it first took the form of a widespread belief that sharp productivity gains stemming
from the information technology industry justified price–earning ratios in the equity market that

38

We note that Figure 9 gives percentage change in debt, rather than debt to GDP, in order not to distort numbers by
the large falls in GDP that sometimes accompany crises. However, the same basic message comes across looking at
debt to GDP instead. Note that the calculations are based on total central government debt.

45

far exceeded any historical norm. 39 That delusion ended with the burst of the IT bubble in 2001.
But the excesses quickly reemerged, morphing into a different shape in a different market. The
securitization of subprime mortgages combined with a heavy appetite for these instruments from
countries like Germany, Japan, and major emerging markets like China fueled perceptions that
housing prices would continue to climb forever. “This time it was different” because there were
new markets, new instruments, and new lenders. In particular, financial engineering was thought
to have tamed risk by better tailoring exposures to investors’ appetites. Derivatives contracts,
meanwhile, offered all manner of hedging opportunities. We now know how that popular
delusion ended.
Historical experience already shows that rich countries are not as “special” as some
cheerleaders had been arguing, both when it comes to managing capital inflows and especially
when it comes to banking crises. This paper has used an extensive new dataset that includes data
on housing prices in some key emerging markets as well as revenue and domestic debt data that
dates back almost a century for most countries and more for many. Surprisingly, not only is the
frequency and duration of banking crises similar across developed countries and middle-income
countries, so too are quantitative measures of both the run-up and the fall-out. Notably, the
duration of real housing price declines following financial crises in both groups are often four
years or more, while the magnitudes of the crash are comparable. One striking finding is the
huge surge in debt most countries experience in the wake of a financial crisis, with real central
government debt typically increasing by about 86 percent on average (in real terms) during the
three years following the crisis.

39

An important question is how rare banking crises, through sudden changes in market liquidity, might amplify the
effects on asset prices analyzed by Barro (2009).

Appendix I. Country sample, crisis definition and dates
In this section, we list the countries in the core sample (Table A1), and describe the
criteria used in this study to date banking crises.
With regard to banking crises, our analysis stresses events. The main reason for
following this approach has to do with the lack of long time-series data that would allow us to
date banking or financial crises quantitatively along the lines of inflation or currency crashes.
For example, the relative price of bank stocks (or financial institutions relative to the market)
would be a logical indicator to examine. However, this is problematic, particularly for the earlier
part of our sample as well as for developing countries (where many domestic banks do not have
publicly traded equity).
If the beginning of a banking crisis is marked by bank runs and withdrawals, then
changes in bank deposits could be used to date the crises. This indicator would have certainly
done well in dating the numerous banking panics of the 1800s. Often, however, the banking
problems do not arise from the liability side, but from a protracted deterioration in asset quality,
be it from a collapse in real estate prices or increased bankruptcies in the nonfinancial sector. In
this case, a large increase in bankruptcies or nonperforming loans could be used to mark the
onset of the crisis. Indicators of business failures and nonperforming loans are also usually
available only sporadically, if at all; the latter are also made less informative by the banks’ desire
to hide their problems for as long as possible.

Given these data limitations, we mark a banking crisis by two types of events: (1) bank runs that
lead to the closure, merging, or takeover by the public sector of one or more financial institutions
(as in Venezuela in 1993 or Argentina in 2001); and (2) if there are no runs, the closure,
merging, takeover, or large-scale government assistance of an important financial institution (or
group of institutions) that marks the start of a string of similar outcomes for other financial
institutions (as in Thailand 1996–97). We rely on existing studies of banking crises and on the
financial press; according to these studies the fragility of the banking sector was widespread
during these periods.
Many country-specific studies (such as Camprubi, 1957, for Peru; Cheng, 2003,
McElderry, 1976, for China; and Noel, 2002, for Mexico) pick up banking crisis episodes not
covered by the multicountry literature and contribute importantly to this chronology, but the
main sources for cross-country dating of crises are as follows: For post-1970, the comprehensive
and well-known study by Caprio and Klingebiel—which the authors updated through 2003—is
authoritative, especially when it comes to classifying banking crises into systemic or more
benign categories; Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999), and Jácome (2008) for Latin America round
out the sources. For pre–World War II, Kindleberger (1989), Bordo et al. (2001), and Willis and
Beckhart (1929) provide multicountry coverage on banking crises.
We relegate a summary discussion of the limitations of this event-based dating approach
to Table A2, while the years in which the banking crises began are listed in Table A3—
unfortunately, for many of the early episodes it is difficult to ascertain how long the crisis lasted.

Definition and/or Criteria

Comments

We mark a banking crisis by two types
of events: (1) bank runs that lead to the
closure, merging, or takeover by the
public sector of one or more financial
institutions; and (2) if there are no runs,
the closure, merging, takeover, or
large-scale government assistance of an
important financial institution (or group
of institutions) that marks the start of a
string of similar outcomes for other
financial institutions.

This approach to dating the beginning of a
banking crisis is not without drawbacks. It
could date a crisis too late, because the
financial problems usually begin well before
a bank is finally closed or merged; it could
also date a crisis too early, because the worst
part of a crisis may come later. Unlike the
external debt crises (see below), which have
well-defined closure dates, it is often difficult
or impossible to accurately pinpoint the year
in which a crisis ended.

Algeria

Brief Summary

Year

After the July 1992 cleanup, 31% of "new" banking system loans were
nonperforming. Some banks faced liquidity problems due to a logjam of
1992
interbank liabilities.
Circulation limits led to suspended specie payments. Lack of mortgage
banking institutes led bank to secure loans based on real estate—many were August 1870
foreclosed to escape loss.

Algeria

Share of nonperforming loans in the banking system reached 50%.

1990–1992

Angola

Two state-owned commercial banks had insolvency problems.

1991–1996

Argentina

Suspension of National Bank of the Argentine Republic; high foreign debt,
domestic credit, and imports led to reserve losses; peso fell 27% but the
January, 1885
crisis was brief and had relatively little impact on industrial production.
Banks made extensive loans, and real estate prices rose dramatically with
excess bank note issue. Land prices fell by 50%, and Bank of the Nation
could not pay its dividend, leading to a run, and the peso fell 36% both
July 1890–1891
years. In July 1890, every bank of issue was suspended—sent gold up 320%.
In December 1890, the Bank of Argentine Nation replaced the old Bank of
the Nation.
Bad harvests and European demands for liquidity due to the War led to bank
1914
runs, with private banks losing 45% of deposits in two years.

End of gold standard with insolvent loans building.

1931

Huge loans to government and nonperforming assets building for many
years; finally all taken over by the new Central Bank.

1934

The failure of a large private bank (Banco de Intercambio Regional) led to
runs on three other banks. Eventually more than 70 institutions—16% of
commercial bank assets and 35% of finance company assets—were
liquidated or subjected to central bank intervention.
In early May, the government closed a large bank, leading to large runs,
which led the government to freeze dollar deposits on May 19.

March,
1980–1982
May, 1985

Nonperforming assets accounted for 27% of aggregate portfolio and 37% of
1989–1990
state banks' portfolios. Failed banks held 40% of financial system assets.

Armenia

The Mexican devaluation led to a run on banks, which resulted in an 18%
decline in deposits between December and March. Eight banks suspended
and three banks collapsed. Through end of 1997, 63 of 205 banking
institutions were closed or merged.
In March 2001, a bank run started due to lack of public confidence in
government policy actions. In late November 2001, many banks were on the
verge of collapsing and partial withdrawal restrictions were imposed
(corralito) and fixed-term deposits (CDs) were reprogrammed to stop
outflows from banks (corralon). In December 2002, the corralito was lifted.
In January 2003, one bank was closed, three banks were nationalized, and
many others were reduced in size.
The Central Bank closed half the active banks; large banks continued to
suffer from a high level of nonperforming loans. The savings bank was
financially weak.

Two banks, with 11% of banking system assets, closed in 1994. In 1995,
four of 15 domestic banks, with 30% of banking system assets, experienced 1994
liquidity problems and suffered a high level of nonperforming loans.

Large government borrowing and currency speculation—the government
continually issued more notes. National Bank of Brazil and Bank of US of

the government's paper notes. Financial-sector turmoil led to decline in
output.
Civil War and currency depreciation. A loan from Rothschild's in London
helped with an agreement on settling the loan.
Inelastic coffee exports could not respond to currency depreciation;
concentrated industry, limited competition, and slowed recovery from
deflation. Liquidity injection did not help—deposits ran off and loans
recalled.

by mid-2002, following allegations of fraud resulting from the discovery of

Year

Bank of Russia closed in April; specie payments suspended and never
resumed. A permanent treasury deficit meant several loans were necessary
and there was a hopeless credit situation.
Skopine community bank garnered deposits from all over the empire but
kept low reserves; bubble burst in 1875 when it could not pay its deposits;
limited communal banking henceforth.
Joint-Stock commercial banks loaded with nonperforming assets; many
small banks failed although large ones were protected by the state bank.
The interbank loan market stopped working due to concerns about
connected lending in many new banks.
Nearly 720 banks, representing half of those in operation, were deemed
insolvent. The banks accounted for 4% of sector assets and 32% of retail
deposits. Eighteen banks, holding 40% of sector assets and 41% of
household deposits, were in serious difficulties and needed rescue.
One well-connected bank closed.
National Bank failed after unsuccessfully trying to adopt the gold standard;
bank notes not accepted anywhere.
End of 1992, 90% of monobank's loans were nonperforming. In 1993,
monobank liquidated and two new banks were licensed and took over most
assets. In 1994, credit operations at one new bank suspended.
Western Bank Failure—brought on by reckless banking practices; bank
made various bad loans to four firms—when discovered, the accounts were
stopped and firms closed. There was a panic on the stock exchange;
depositors withdraw their accounts and bank failed.
City of Glasgow Bank failure: falsification of books for three years, with
loans to four firms; ruined shareholders, not creditors.
Bank of Scotland absorbed Caledonian Bank, and North of Scotland Bank
absorbed Town & Country Bank.
In 1988, 50% of loans were nonperforming. Six commercial banks and one
development bank closed (20–30% of financial system assets).
In 1995, 40–50% of banking system loans were
nonperforming—undergoing bank recapitalization and restructuring.
