Predictability and 'Good Deals' in Currency Markets

JEL No. F31,G15
ABSTRACT
This paper studies predictability of currency returns over the period 1971-2006. To assess the economic
significance of currency predictability, we construct an upper bound on the explanatory power of predictive
regressions. The upper bound is motivated by "no good-deal" restrictions that rule out unduly attractive
investment opportunities. We find evidence that predictability often exceeds this bound. Excess-predictability
is highest in the 1970s and tends to decrease over time, but it is still present in the final part of the
sample period. Moreover, periods of high and low predictability tend to alternate. These stylized facts
pose a challenge to Fama's (1970) Efficient Market Hypothesis but are consistent with Lo's (2004)
Adaptive Market Hypothesis, coupled with slow convergence towards efficient markets. Strategies
that attempt to exploit daily excess-predictability are very sensitive to transaction costs but those that
exploit monthly predictability remain attractive even after realistic levels of transaction costs are taken
into account and are not spanned by either the Fama and French (1993) equity-based factors or the
AFX Currency Management Index.

Predictability and ‘Good Deals’
in Currency Markets
This paper studies predictability of currency returns over the period 1971-2006. To
assess the economic significance of returns predictability, we construct an upper
bound on the explanatory power of predictive regressions. The upper bound is
motivated by “no good-deal” restrictions that rule out unduly attractive investment
opportunities. We find evidence that predictability often exceeds this bound. Excesspredictability is highest in the 1970s and tends to decrease over time, but it is still
present in the final part of the sample period. Moreover, periods of high and low
predictability tend to alternate. These stylized facts pose a challenge to Fama’s
(1970) Efficient Market Hypothesis but are consistent with Lo’s (2004) Adaptive
Market Hypothesis, coupled with slow convergence towards efficient markets.
Strategies that attempt to exploit daily excess-predictability are very sensitive to
transaction costs but those that exploit monthly predictability remain attractive even
after realistic levels of transaction costs are taken into account and are not spanned
either by the Fama and French (1993) equity-based factors or by the AFX Currency
Management Index.

1. Introduction

In a literature that spans more than thirty years, various studies have reported that
filter rules, moving average crossover rules, and other technical trading rules often
result in statistically significant trading profits in currency markets. Beginning with
Dooley and Shafer (1976, 1984) and continuing with Sweeney (1986), Levich and
Thomas (1993), Neely, Weller and Dittmar (1997), Chang and Osler (1999), Gencay
(1999), LeBaron (1999), Olson (2004), and Schulmeister (2006), among others, this
evidence casts doubts on the simple efficient market hypothesis, even though it is not
incompatible with efficient markets under time-varying risk premia and predictability
induced by time-varying expected returns. More recently, however, and contrary to
the bulk of these earlier findings, Pukthuanthong, Levich and Thomas (2007) find

2

evidence of diminishing profitability of currency trading rules over time. In a
comprehensive re-evaluation of the evidence hitherto provided by the extant
literature, Neely, Weller and Ulrich (2007), also find evidence of declining
profitability of technical trading rules.

In this paper, we directly assess whether currency returns are predictable to an extent
that implies violation of the efficient market hypothesis (henceforth, EMH) and
whether the evidence against the EMH has changed over time. To this end, we test
whether, conditional on sensible restrictions on the volatility of the kernel that prices
the assets, currency return predictability can be exploited to generate “good deals.”
The latter, following the terminology introduced by Cochrane and Saà Requeio
(2000), Cerný and Hodges (2001) and Cochrane (2001), are investment opportunities
that offer unduly high Sharpe ratios. To check on the availability of “good deals,” we
construct a theoretical time-varying upper bound on the explanatory power of
predictive regressions. This bound, following Ross (2005), is ultimately a function of
the volatility of the kernel that prices the assets traded in the economy, and it makes
precise the intuitive connection between predictability, risk and reward for risk. In an
efficient market, predictability should never exceed the bound as violations of the
latter would imply the availability of “good deals,” i.e. the possibility of exploiting
predictability to generate unduly high Sharpe ratios. We thus test for violations of the
EMH by comparing the explanatory power of predictive regressions with the
theoretical “no good deal” bound. In doing so, we examine how predictability has
varied over time and we compare and contrast predictability patterns with historical

3

patterns in the profitability of technical trading rules considered by the extant
literature.

In a stock market setting, related empirical literature includes the work of Campbell
and Thompson (2005) and, with an emphasis on the role of conditioning information,
Stremme, Basu, and Abhyankar (2005). Pesaran and Timmermann (1995) study the
empirical link between predictability and risk (and thus reward for risk) by
examining stock predictability at times of high and low market volatility. While these
authors empirically exploit the link between the economy’s maximal Sharpe ratio and
the amount of admissible predictability, they do not directly test for violations of the
EMH. This is the approach we take here and it represents the main contribution of the
paper. As pointed out by Taylor (2005), currency strategies tend to be, by far, more
profitable than strategies that attempt to exploit the predictability of other asset
classes. It is therefore rather surprising that this approach has not been previously
attempted in a study of the efficiency of the currency market.

Empirically, we find evidence of recurring violations of the EMH. While such
violations are especially severe in the initial part of the sample period, excesspredictability has not disappeared from the mid-1990s onwards, in contrast with the
vanishing profitability of many popular technical trading rules reported in some
recent studies, e.g. Neely, Weller and Ulrich (2007) and Pukthuanthong, Levich and
Thomas (2007). Importantly, we find that predictability varies over time in a roughly
cyclical manner with recurring albeit relatively short-lived episodes during which it

4

exceeds the no good-deal upper bound. Suggestively, while this evidence is in
contrast with the EMH, it is consistent with implications of Lo’s (2004) Adaptive
Market Hypothesis (AMH), in that bursts of predictability would appear to occur
when shifts in market conditions require market participants to re-learn how to make
efficient forecasts. While realistic levels of transaction costs, especially those arising
as a result of ‘price pressure,’ e.g. Evans and Lyons (2002), can account for part of
these violations and daily predictability is difficult to exploit because it would require
frequent trading, strategies that exploit monthly predictability are much less sensitive
to transaction costs and expand the investment opportunity set, thus rationalizing
market participants’ enduring tendency to engage in technical analysis and other
active currency management practices.

In the next section, we outline the theoretical relation between predictability and
time-varying expected returns, on the one hand, and trading rule profitability, on the
other hand. We also introduce Ross’ (2005) upper bound on the pricing kernel
volatility and we discuss its implications for the maximum amount of predictability
compatible with foreign exchange market efficiency. In Section 3, we describe our
dataset. In Section 4, we describe the simple rolling autoregressions (AR) and
autoregressive moving average models (ARMA) that we employ to capture
predictability and present preliminary empirical results on the predictability of the
currencies in our sample. In Section 5, we illustrate the link between predictability
and the maximal Sharpe ratio of strategies that optimally attempt to exploit it. In
Section 6, we consider the strategies that exploit estimated predictability to generate

5

maximal Sharpe Ratios and we evaluate the impact of transaction costs on their
profitability. In Section 7, in the spirit of White’s (2000) reality checks, we assess the
possible impact of sampling error on our inferences. In Section 8, we adopt an
explicit multi-factor asset pricing perspective to assess to what extent strategies that
exploit predictability expand the investment opportunity set of an investor endowed
with rational expectations. In the final Section, we summarize our main findings and
offer conclusions.

2. Predictability, Time-Varying Expected Returns and Pricing Kernel Volatility

Trading rule profitability implies that returns are to some extent predictable. This
predictability, in turn, can stem either from time-varying expected returns, thus
representing an equilibrium reward for risk, or from information contained in past
prices unexploited by market participants. The former possibility is consistent with
the notion of market efficiency, whereas the latter is not. Clearly, being able to fully
discriminate between these two possibilities requires an equilibrium asset pricing
model. More formally, consider the following model of excess returns:

rt +1 = µ t +1 + ε t +1

(1)

µ t +1 ≡ E (rt +1 | I t ) ≡ µ ( I t )

(2)

where

6

Here, I t is the information set at time t and ε t +1 is a conditionally zero-mean
innovation. Then, following Ross (2005), we can write:

σ 2 (rt +1 ) = σ µ2 + σ 2 (ε t +1 )

(3)

Here, σ µ2 = σ 2 [ µ ( I t )] . Dividing both sides by σ 2 (rt +1 ) and rearranging, we see that
predictability is related to variation σ µ2 in mean excess returns:

R2 = 1 −

σ 2 (ε t +1 )
σ µ2
=
σ 2 (rt +1 ) σ 2 (rt +1 )

(4)

Variation in mean excess returns, in turn, can either come from variation in
equilibrium risk premia, consistent with the EMH, or from variation in abnormal
mean returns that has not been exploited by the posited rational investor and thus is at
odds with the EMH. To discriminate between these two possibilities, one must
identify the rational component of σ µ2 . One way of doing this is to specify the model
that determines µ t +1 , but this approach entails the difficult task of specifying a full
model of rational asset pricing, an ongoing endeavour that has not hitherto enjoyed
unchallenged empirical success. An alternative approach, and the one that we pursue
here, is to model σ µ2 directly. To do this, we start from recognizing that, as noted by
Ross (2005), we can write:

7

σ µ2 ≤ E ( µ t +1 2 ) ≤ (1 + R f ) 2 σ 2 (rt +1 )σ 2 (mt +1 )

(5)

Here, R f denotes the unconditional risk-free rate. The first inequality in (5),

σ µ2 = E[ µ t +1 − E ( µ t +1 )]2 ≤ E ( µ t +1 2 ) , is based on an elementary result from
descriptive statistics. The second inequality follows from the fact that, under noarbitrage

and

in

a

friction-less

economy,

the

pricing

kernel

satisfies

µ t +1 = (1 + R f )Cov(rt +1 , mt +1 | I t ) , while the correlation between the kernel and the
asset excess return is bounded from above, in absolute value, by one. Using (5) in
(4), we see that predictability is bounded from above by a quantity that depends on
the amount of volatility of the kernel that prices the assets:

R 2 ≤ (1 + R f ) 2 σ 2 (mt +1 )

(6)

Notably, the restriction in (6) holds unconditionally and thus for the in-sample
coefficient of determination of any predictive regression. Under the rational
expectations (RE) assumption originally formulated by Muth (1961), there is a tight
link between the pricing kernel mt +1 and investors’ marginal utility. The RE
assumption, in turn, is a necessary condition for the EMH to hold. These
considerations suggest one way to mitigate the stark alternative between having to
conduct a joint test of market efficiency and of a particular asset pricing model and
not being able to discriminate between time-variation in equilibrium returns and
abnormal profitability. A possible solution is to impose just enough restrictions on
8

preferences to be able to restrict the volatility of the pricing kernel. This then yields
restrictions on the maximal SR of the economy and on predictability.

To draw testable implications of the EMH for return predictability, we may thus
proceed by assuming that there exist a group of greedy, risk-averse investors
endowed with RE and that such investors are sufficiently homogeneous and wealthy
to act as the marginal investor. Ross (2005) argues that the volatility of the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution of the marginal investor provides an upper
bound to the volatility of the pricing kernel. If we restrict the curvature of this
investor’s utility function by imposing a relative risk aversion upper bound RRAV, we
can then place the following upper bound on the volatility of the kernel mt +1 that
prices the assets:

σ 2 (mt +1 ) ≤ σ 2 (mV ,t +1 ) ≅ RRAV2σ 2 (rm,t +1 )

(7)

Here, mV ,t +1 is the inter-temporal marginal rate of substitution between present and
future wealth of an investor with relative risk aversion RRAV , the latter is the relative
risk aversion upper bound, and σ (rm,t +1 ) is the volatility of the market excess-return
rm ,t +1 . Based on (6), the pricing kernel volatility bound in (7) implies the following

upper bound on the explanatory power of any predictive regression of asset returns:

φ ≡ (1 + R f ) 2 RRAV2σ 2 (rm,t +1 ) ≅ RRAV2σ 2 (rm,t +1 )

(8)
9

Thus, under the EMH, we should observe R 2 ≤ φ and hence R 2 ≤ RRAV2 σ 2 (rm,t +1 ) .
To fix ideas, we may define a ‘boundary violation index,’ henceforth BVI, as the
difference between the coefficient of determination of the estimated predictive
regression and the predictability bound, i.e. BVI = R 2 − φ . The inequality in (6)
implies that BVI should be non-positive for all predictive regressions of the returns
on all traded assets priced by the kernel m.

To operationalize (8), we need to specify the RRA upper bound RRAV. Ross (2005)
suggests imposing an upper bound of 5 on the relative risk aversion of the marginal
investor, i.e. RRAV ≤ 5 . Among the motivations advanced by Ross (2005) to do so,
the one that most easily applies to a world with possibly non-normally distributed
returns and non-quadratic utility is the simple observation that a relative risk aversion
higher than 5 implies that the marginal investor would be willing to pay more than 10
percent per annum to avoid a 20 percent volatility of his wealth (i.e., about the
unconditional volatility of the S&P from 1926) which, by introspection, seems large.

It might be questioned whether a risk aversion upper bound of 5 is large enough in
light of evidence, provided by the empirical literature on the “equity premium
puzzle,” that points to much larger values. For example, Mehra and Prescott’s (1985)
seminal study suggests that, given the real rate of return on risk free assets, risk
aversion in excess of 50 is needed to explain the US equity premium in a model with
frictionless capital markets and standard preference assumptions. As formally shown
10

by Ross (2005), however, requiring the upper bound on RRA to exceed such
empirical lower bounds provided by the literature on the “equity premium puzzle”
would neglect the important circumstance that it is the marginal investors' risk
aversion that matters, not the average investor's one, and in the former the risk
aversion of wealthier and less risk averse investors takes a much larger weight than in
the latter. Related arguments offered by Ross (2005) draw on the reasonable idea that
aggregate consumption is much less volatile than the portfolio realistically held by
the marginal investors, i.e. by investors who have the capacity of influencing prices.

A study by Meyer and Meyer (2005) has recently provided a comprehensive reevaluation of the hitherto rather scattered empirical evidence on investors’ risk
aversion. They show that relative risk aversion estimates reported by the extant
literature are less heterogeneous and extreme if one takes into account measurement
issues and the outcome variable with respect to which each study defines risk
aversion. Using returns on stock investments as the outcome variable, calculations by
Meyer and Meyer (2005) show that the RRA coefficient in the classical Friend and
Blume’s (1975) study of household asset allocation choices ranges between 6.4 and
2.0, and decreases in investors’ wealth. Using returns on the investors’ overall
wealth, including real estate and a measure of human capital, the RRA estimate
ranges between 3.0 and 2.4. The same calculations show that the RRA implied by
Barsky et al. (1997) experiment ranges between 0.8 and 1.6.1 Importantly, these

1

When Meyer and Meyer (2005) consider estimates provided by studies based on asset pricing data,
e.g. studies of the equity premium puzzle, they calculate somewhat higher values. Since in these
studies the estimates of risk aversion are backed out parametrically from estimates of a particular asset
11

estimates, at least for the wealthiest cohorts of investors, are always considerably
lower than 5, i.e. the upper bound suggested by Ross (2005).

In light of the evidence reviewed by Meyer and Meyer (2005), alongside the RRA
upper bound of 5 suggested by Ross (2005), we will also experiment with a lower
value for the RRA upper bound, i.e. RRAV = 2.5 . This value is just above the relative
risk aversion of the marginal investor in the stock market, if we assume that this
investor’s preferences are described by a power utility function and we estimate the
mean and volatility of the stock market using the historical average and standard
deviation of the returns on the S&P index since 1926. This bound implies that the
marginal investor would be willing to pay up to 5 percent per annum, arguably still a
relatively large amount, to avoid a 20 percent volatility of his wealth.

3. Data

Our data comprise daily and monthly returns on the spot exchange rate against the
US Dollar of the major currencies (except those that were replaced by the Euro) for
the period 1971-2006 taken by Bloomberg at the close of business in London at 6:00
p.m. GMT.2 These currencies are the Australian and Canadian Dollar (AUD and
CAD, respectively), the Japanese Yen (JPY), the British Pound (GPB), the Swiss

pricing model, often based on a narrow definition of the market portfolio, they are of no interest for
the purpose of computing the SDF volatility bound. Their use would imply a circular argument.
2
We also use daily data, provided by Bloomberg, on the front month futures contract on the exchange
rate of each of the above currencies against the US Dollar traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
(CME), but the results are not reported because they are qualitatively indistinguishable from, and
quantitatively very similar to, the results for the underlying currencies.
12

Franc (CHF) and the Euro (denoted as ECU/EUR because we combine data on the
ECU before the introduction of the Euro in 1999 and on the latter after its launch). To
proxy for the return on the market portfolio we use daily and monthly returns on the
S&P500 index constructed from last traded price and dividend data provided by
Datastream.

4. Currency Returns Predictability

To conduct our tests of currency market efficiency, we estimate simple predictive
regressions of the returns on the currencies in our sample. Next, we construct
empirical counterparts to the predictability bound in (8) and we compare the
coefficient of determination of the estimated predictive regressions with the
constructed bound. As shown by Taylor (1994), among others, ARIMA models of
exchange rates, and thus ARMA models of currency returns, capture substantial
predictability. Our estimated models are thus specifications of the general
ARMA(p,q) model, where p denotes the autoregressive lag order and q denotes the
order of the moving average term:
yt = const. + b1yt-1 + ..... + bpyt-p + c1ut-1 + ..... + cqut-q + ut

(9)

We apply versions of (9) to both currency returns and to returns adjusted by the
interest differential (i.e. the differential between the funding cost in US Dollars and

13

the return from reinvesting the funds in each one of the foreign currencies).3 We find
that adjusting returns for the interest differential has virtually no impact on estimated
predictability. This is because the volatility of the interest differential is negligible
relative to currency returns volatility. Thus, to avoid duplication of indistinguishable
predictability estimates, in the remainder of this study we work with currency return
data only.

We start by estimating specifications of (9) over rolling windows of daily and
monthly data for all currency returns in our sample, and recording their coefficients
of determination. The predictive models are ARMA(5,0) or, equivalently, AR(5), for
daily returns, and ARMA(5,2) for monthly returns. These specifications are chosen
because they capture reasonably well the predictability of currencies in our sample,
as suggested by Ljung-Box (1978) tests of the null of residual serial correlation,
rejected for lags of up to the 36th order.4 The estimation window l is one year, i.e. l =
252 trading days, for daily data and 5 years, i.e. l = 5 × 12 = 60 months, for monthly
data. In other word, each predictive autoregression is estimated over a window that
runs between t-l and t, where window length l equals 252 for daily data and 60 for
monthly data. For each currency i, this yields daily and monthly series of coefficients
3

As a proxy for the risk-free rate on assets denominated in the currencies included in our dataset, we
use daily middle rate data on Australian Dollar and German Mark inter-bank ‘call money’ deposits, on
Canadian Dollar and Swiss Franc Euro-market short-term deposits (provided by the Financial
Times/ICAP), on inter-bank overnight deposits in GBP and the middle rate implied by Japan’s
Gensaki T-Bill overnight contracts (a sort of repo contract used by arbitrageurs in Japan to finance
forward positions). The rate on German Mark deposits is used as a proxy for the rate at which it is
possible to invest funds denominated in ECU, while the overnight Euribor is used as a proxy for the
rate at which it is possible to invest Euro denominated funds. As a proxy for the US risk-free rate, we
use daily data on 1 month T-Bills (yields implied by the mid-price at the close of the secondary
market). The interest rate data are taken from Datastream.

of determination Ri2,(t −l ) →t estimated over rolling estimation window of returns from
t–l to t. To estimate a time-varying predictability bound φt at the daily (monthly)

frequency, we proxy for the variance of the market return between t-l and t, i.e.

σ (2t −l ) →t (rS & P ,t − l + s ) with s ∈ [1, 2 .....l ] , as the average, over rolling windows of 1 year
(5 years) of daily (monthly) GARCH(1,1) S&P500 returns rS & P ,t − l + s . To compute

φt , as prescribed by (7), we then multiply σ (2t −l ) →t (rS & P ,t − l + s ) by the square of the
chosen RRA upper bound, i.e. by the square of the chosen value of RRAV.

The resulting daily time-series of the rolling coefficients of determination for each
currency are plotted in Figure 1, against the time series of the rolling predictability
bound φt computed by setting RRAV = 5. The corresponding monthly series are
qualitatively similar and they are not shown to save space.5 Visual inspection of
Figure 1 reveals that the coefficients of determination of the estimated
autoregressions are almost always above the bound. In fact, perhaps surprisingly,
sub-periods when the bound is not violated represent the exception rather than the
norm. As a consequence, as detailed in Table 1, the BVI is positive in more than 90
percent of the yearly rolling estimation windows for all currencies over the period
1971-2006 and three sub-periods of roughly equal length 1971-1983, 1984-1995,
1996-2006. Perhaps more remarkably, for most currencies and sub-periods, the
frequency of positive BVI values, and thus predictability upper bound violations, is
almost 100 percent.

5. Economic Significance of Predictability

There is a tight link between predictability and the Sharpe ratio (SR) of strategies
designed to exploit it. This link can be used to express predictability in units that
have an immediate economic interpretation. To begin, it is worth recalling that, by a
familiar Hansen and Jagannathan (1991) result, the economy maximal Sharpe ratio,
and thus the maximum amount of profitability per unit of risk from any trading
strategy is bounded from above by the volatility of the pricing kernel:

E ( µ t +1 )

σ (rt +1 )

= SR ≤ (1 + R f )σ (mt +1 )

(10)

Thus, from (6) and (10), it is clear that the volatility of the pricing kernel places an
upper bound on both predictability and the maximal SR of the economy. This
circumstance can be seen as a consequence of the fact that the coefficient of
determination of predictive regressions can itself be interpreted as a maximal Sharpe
ratio. To show this, we use an elementary statistical result that relates the variance of
a random variable to its second moment and the square of its mean, and re-write the
coefficient of determination in (4) as follows:

R =
2

σ µ2
σ r2

−1

1 ⎛ µ ′µ
µ2
µ2
⎞ 1 ⎛ DD ′ ⎞

= 2⎜
− µ 2 ⎟ = µ ′⎜
⎟ µ − 2 = µ ′(DD ′) µ − 2 (11)
σr
σr ⎝ T
σr
⎠ T ⎝ T ⎠

16

Here, µ is the T × 1 vector that stacks the conditional means of the currency return
at each point in time t, t = 1, ....T, µ is the unconditional mean return (a scalar) and

D denotes a T × T diagonal matrix with elements along the main diagonal that
contain the conditional standard deviation of the currency return at each point in time
t. In using this notation, we are essentially interpreting a strategy aimed at exploiting
predictability as a portfolio made up of as many positions as data points in the sample
period, each with its own ‘conditional’ SR. In monthly and higher frequency data, the
second term on the far right-hand side of (11) is negligible, as it is the square of a
typically small percentage number.6 In light of this, we can approximate the
coefficient of determination as follows,

R 2 ≅ µ ′(DD ′) µ
−1

(12)

Interestingly, if one neglects the possible temporal interdependencies across
conditional volatilities, i.e. if one neglects GARCH effects, (12) implies that the
coefficient of determination in predictive regressions can be interpreted as the
squared maximal SR attainable by forming ‘portfolios,’ i.e. strategies, of one-period
positions in the currency under consideration. Up to a constant of proportionality, the
weights with which each one-period position enters such strategy are then

W = (DD ′) µ
−1

6

(13)

Currencies have typically a drift rate very close to zero.
17

Intuitively, a trading strategy based on the above inter-temporal weights amounts to
using a predictive model that combines a directional signal, the conditional mean µt ,
with a volatility filter, i.e. the elements σ t of D. These results are useful in that they
offer insights into the economic significance of predictability and help appreciate its
magnitude. Following this logic, we create an excess-predictability measure and,
based on (12), we express it in annualized Sharpe ratios units. To do so, we rely on
our boundary violation index introduced earlier ( BVI = R 2 − φ ) and compute the
square root of its annualized value,

γ i ,t

0

→ t1

≡ BVI i ,t 0 →t1

l
years

Here, t0 and t1 are the beginning and end points, respectively, of the sub-periods
over which we estimate BVI i ,t0 →t1 and compute γ i ,t 0 →t1 , i.e. 1971-1976, 1977-1982,
1983-1988, 1989-1994, 1995-2000 and 2001-2006. Clearly, γ i ,t 0 →t1 is defined only
when BVI i ,t 0 →t1 ≥ 0 . The quantity under the square root is multiplied by the ratio of
the number of observations to the number of years in the estimation window length,
i.e.

windows of daily data and

data). The quantity γ i ,t 0 →t1 has an appealing economic interpretation. Based on (12),

18

it can be seen as the annualized excess-SR that can be earned by exploiting
predictability, assuming that one trades at the indicated frequency (i.e. daily or
monthly). The value taken by γ i ,t0 →t1 , therefore, can be seen as a measure of “good
deal” availability.7

In Table 2, we report the computed values of γ i ,t0 →t1 based on estimates obtained
using daily and monthly data.8 These excess predictability measures are in many
cases positive and economically sizable. Excess-predictability is especially high in
the initial part of the sample periods, i.e. in 1971-1976. In subsequent periods, the
computed values of γ i ,t0 →t1 are generally lower, but a clear declining pattern can be
detected only in the values taken by the γ i ,t 0 →t1 of AUD, except for a surge in the
final period, and to a lesser extent JPY. Except again for a surge in the final 5-year
period, such a declining trend is more evident, especially in the daily case, in the
arithmetic average of γ i ,t 0 →t1 across all currencies reported in the last column. In the
case of ECU/EUR, there is a burst of predictability between 1989 and 1994, possibly
in relation to market adjustments leading to the adoption of the Euro.

We acknowledge that the empirical results are in-sample and may appear less convincing as evidence
of “good deals” availability and thus EMH violations. However, our methodology is consistent with
the essence of equation (6) and not a limitation. In addition, many currency speculators employed
technical rules similar to (9) and captured returns in line with our calculations.

have generated abnormal profitability over the periods 1976-1980 and 1986-1990 but
also that excess-profitability disappeared after 1991. Neely, Weller and Ulrich (2007)
examine a more comprehensive set of trading rules and report similar findings. Large
values of our measure of excess-predictability γ i ,t 0 →t1 , over the periods 1971-1976,
1977-1982 and, to a lesser extent, 1983-1988, are consistent with Olson’s (2004) and
Neely, Weller and Ulrich’s (2007) findings. As shown in Figure 2, the average BVI
across our currencies declines over time and this is also broadly consistent with
evidence of diminishing abnormal profitability of technical trading rules reported by
these authors, in that decreasing excess-predictability presumably makes it more
difficult for technical trading rules to spot profitable trends.

Our findings, however, do not support the view that excess-predictability has
disappeared from the early 1990s onwards, or at least that it has been steadily
declining since then. To the contrary, the increase of the excess-predictability of a
number of currencies, in the latter part of the sample period, is in contrast with this
conclusion. To reconcile our evidence with the findings of diminishing profitability
of technical trading rules reported by Olson (2004) and Neely, Weller and Ulrich
(2007), one must posit that the rules considered by these authors do not capture all
predictability. Evidence provided by Pukthuanthong, Levich and Thomas (2007)
suggests that trend-following rules that were once profitable now lose money,
whereas the corresponding counter-trending rules, i.e. rules that do exactly the
opposite, are increasingly profitable. Our excess-predictability measure would
capture the excess-profitability of both types of strategies. Our results, contrary to

20

Olson’s (2004) and Neely, Weller and Ulrich’s (2007) findings, are also consistent
with evidence of high trading profits from momentum strategies during the 1990s
reported by Okunev and White (2003), as we generally do not find evidence of
declining excess-predictability after 1991.

On balance, our findings represent intriguing prima facie evidence that there is nonnegligible excess-predictability in currency markets and that this excesspredictability, in recent years, has declined from its 1970s peaks without
disappearing entirely. This implies that there might be good reasons why currency
traders, in their pursuit of profitability and against academic advice, have long
engaged in technical analysis and other practices aimed at exploiting predictable
patterns in currency returns. Taken at face value, these results represent potential
evidence against the EMH. There is the possibility, however, that high transaction
costs might have to be incurred to exploit the estimated predictability and that our
estimates of the coefficient of determination R2 be inflated by sampling error. We
now investigate these important possibilities in turn.

6. The Impact of Transaction Costs

To gain insights into the impact of transaction costs, it is necessary to consider the
strategies that would have to be implemented in order to exploit the estimated
predictability. To this end, we use the weights in (13) to construct maximal SR
strategies for each currency and calculate their returns after transaction costs. Much

21

of the extant literature considers transaction costs of about 0.05 percent, or 5 basis
points, realistic for a typical round trip trade between professional counterparts, see
Levich and Thomas (1993) and Neely, Weller and Dittmar (1997). This corresponds
to about 2-3 basis points on each one way, i.e. buy or sell, transaction. In calculating
the return to these strategies, therefore, we allow for transaction costs of up to 5 basis
points. For comparison, we also experiment with transaction costs of 25 basis points.
In the context of our ARMA(p,q), the mean vector in (13) equals the conditional
mean of (9), i.e. µt = yt − ut , while DD′ collapses to the currency return sample
variance times a T × T identity matrix, i.e. σ 2 ( yt +1 ) I T ×T .

In Figure 3, to illustrate, we plot the time-varying weights, calculated using (13) and
normalized to add up to unity, of the maximal SR strategies that exploit the daily and
monthly predictability of the Canadian Dollar, based on AR(5) and ARMA(5,2)
specifications, respectively, estimated over the period 1995-2006. The corresponding
plots for other currencies, predictive models and sample periods are not reported to
save space. In all cases, there is substantial variation in the weights of the (daily)
positions entailed by the maximal SR strategies that optimally exploit daily
predictability, as a result of the conditional time-variation of the mean of the return
process. There is much less variation in the weights of the (monthly) positions
required to exploit monthly predictability. This means that strategies that exploit
daily predictability are rebalanced more frequently than those that exploit monthly
predictability and therefore transaction costs are likely to have a greater impact on
the former than on the latter. Notably, in classic filter and moving-average strategies,
22

trading positions change relatively infrequently.9 This is because such strategies often
exploit predictability at low frequency and thus avoid the burden of high transaction
costs.

In Table 3, we report the SRs offered by maximal SR strategies that exploit daily and
monthly predictability. As before, the predictive model for daily returns is
ARMA(5,0) whereas the predictive model for monthly returns is ARMA(5,2). For all
the currencies under consideration, except CHF, transaction costs of 3 basis points
are enough to lower the SRs of the daily strategies below the level that corresponds
to the tightest predictability bound and the maximal SRs of the strategies based on
the daily predictability of AUD, JPY and ECU/Euro become negative. With
transaction costs of five basis points, the maximal SRs of daily strategies are negative
for all currencies. The strategies that exploit monthly predictability, however, are
much less sensitive to transaction costs. In all sub-sample periods, the SRs for the
maximal SR monthly strategies are positive even with transaction costs of 5 basis
points. More importantly, they often exceed the threshold implied by the
predictability bound, reported in the last two columns, even under RRAV = 5.
Crucially, this happens in the latter sample period too, contrary to studies cited earlier
which find that certain popular trading strategies are not profitable from the 1990s
onwards.

9

For example, Levich and Thomas (1993) report that over their 15 year sample period of major
currencies, the 5 day / 20 day moving average rule traded 13 times per year.
23

Overall, these findings suggest that, while daily predictability cannot be exploited
because of high transaction costs, lower frequency (monthly) predictability might be
amenable to generate high SRs because trading frequency and transaction costs are
reduced. The latter circumstance poses a challenge to the EMH, as in an efficient
market investors endowed with rational expectations should detect excesspredictability and recognize and exploit the attendant “good deal” opportunities,
thereby bringing predictability within the bound provided by the volatility of the
pricing kernel. In turn, this suggests that trading strategies based on low-frequency
currency predictability might be attractive for professional investors, at least for those
who can use available information better than the representative investor and face
moderate yet realistic levels of transaction costs.

A word of caution is in order at this point with respect to the likely magnitude of any
available “good deal.” There is substantial evidence that transaction costs depend on
the size of the transaction and, more specifically, on “price pressure.” For example,
Evans and Lyons (2002) estimate that a buy order of 1 million US dollars increases
the execution exchange rate against the Deutsche Mark and the Japanese Yen by as
much as 0.54 percent, or 54 basis points. Similar figures are provided by Berger,
Chernenko, Howorka and Write (2006), at least for trades executed over a daily
horizon. As shown in Table 3, transaction costs of 25 basis points are enough, with
few exceptions, to lower SRs below the threshold that corresponds to the wider
predictability bound, i.e. the bound corresponding to RRAV = 5 , and often below the
level implied by the tighter predictability bound, i.e. the bound corresponding to

24

RRAV = 2.5 . Similar or higher levels of transaction costs, as implied by the evidence
provided by the literature on “price pressure,” are to be expected for large
transactions.

High transaction costs by themselves generate apparent excess-predictability. Roll
(1984), for example, show that the bid-ask bounce induces an amount of
predictability that depends on the relative magnitude of the bid-ask spread and
exchange rate variability. This predictability is not exploitable by construction,
because any attempt to exploit it would be costly. The evidence of high predictability
and these considerations on the impact of transaction costs on the profitability of
large-size transaction, taken together, allow one to rationalize, on the one hand, the
frequent occurrence of studies that find abnormally profitable strategies and, on the
other hand, the persistence of excess-profitability. We conjecture that available “good
deal” opportunities might persist over time because, though in principle
advantageous, they do not attract enough investors or investors with enough risk
capital, perhaps due to the presence of a fixed component of transaction costs, e.g.
entry costs. We leave, however, a formal investigation of this issue, i.e. the link
between transaction costs, transaction size and persistence of profit opportunities, for
future research.

25

7. The Impact of Sampling Error

To gain insight into the impact of sampling error on our assessment of excesspredictability, we compare the estimated BVI with a measure of sampling error of the
coefficient of determination of the estimated predictive regressions. To this end, we
construct a modified version of the BVI, i.e. BVIadj, by reducing BVI by an amount
that reflects an estimate of sampling error at a specified confidence level,

BVI adj = BVI − s.e. R 2 ,95%

Here, s.e.R 2 ,95% denotes the sampling error, at the 95 percent confidence level, of the
estimated coefficient of determination of the predictive regression. To obtain an
estimate of sampling error, we use the asymptotic distribution of the coefficient of
determination R̂ 2 of the ARMA(p,q) model, valid when the model parameters are
estimated, derived by Hosking (1979), i.e.10

then, provides an

Because, as shown in Table 3 and discussed in the preceding section, the profitability
of strategies that exploit daily predictability is seriously affected by transaction costs,
we focus on the assessment of the statistical significance of monthly predictability.
The times series of BVIadj, based on ARMA(5,2) predictive regressions estimated

predictability occurred at various points over the sample period, for example in the
1970s and 1980s, around the European Monetary System (EMS) crisis of the early
1990s and at the time of the Asian Financial Crisis in the second half of the 1990s. In
the more recent part of the sample period, the return on a number of currencies,
especially AUD, JPY, CHF and EUR also experienced episodes of significant
excess-predictability. Overall, as emphasized by the 12-month moving average
superimposed to the BVI series, statistically significant excess-predictability displays
a roughly cyclical pattern, i.e. periods of high and low predictability alternate over
time, consistent with Lo’s (2004) AMH. Suggestively, episodes of excesspredictability appear to present themselves at times of changing economic conditions,
only to relatively quickly come to an end as market participants re-learn efficient
information processing, i.e. to do so in the context of the new economic conditions.

Next, we compute BVIadj over estimation windows corresponding to six 5-year long
non overlapping periods of roughly equal length between 1972 and 2006. We then
‘translate’ the computed BVIadj values into annualized SRs units, i.e. we construct a
version of γ i ,t 0 →t1 adjusted for sampling error,

If we estimated the latter using m = ∞, we would have very few observations at our disposal to
estimate autocorrelations of high orders, i.e. with k large and close to T. This would lead to
inconsistent estimates of ρk and thus of the sampling error of R2.

As before, t0 and t1 are the beginning and end points, respectively, of the subperiods over which we compute γ adj ;i ,t0 →t1 . We estimate BVIadj and γ adj ;i ,t0 →t1 using
both daily and monthly data but we tabulate results for monthly data only, due to the
high transaction costs that must be incurred to exploit daily predictability and thus
due to its likely limited economic significance. For the case of monthly data, the ratio

l
, that serves to annualize, equals 12. The quantity γ adj ;i ,t0 →t1 can be seen as the
years
annualized excess-SR that can be earned, at the 95 percent confidence level, by
exploiting excess predictability, assuming that one trades at the indicated frequency
(i.e., monthly). The predictive regressions, ARMA(5,2) for monthly data, are
estimated using maximum likelihood14. The constructed values of γ adj ;i ,t 0 →t1 are
reported in Table 4, alongside Hosking’s (1978) H statistic and associated p-value of
the test that estimated predictability does not exceed the upper bound. They suggest,
in the 1980s, the presence of excess-predictability of AUD, JPY and, to a lesser
extent, CAD. The evidence of excess-predictability is still present in the 1990s for
GBP and CHF, with SRs in excess of the RRA = 5 bound as large as 9.67 and almost
38.81 percent, respectively. GBP also exhibits high statistically significant excesspredictability in a number of periods.

14

We use the implementation of this method available in the econometric package RATS™.
29

The estimate of sampling error used to construct BVIadj might be biased or not
converge fast enough to provide a reliable estimate of sampling error of the
coefficient of determination of the estimated predictive regressions. In fact,
Hosking’s (1979) result is only valid asymptotically in large samples and it assumes
that the estimated predictive regression be the true data-generating model.15 This
might lead to an over-estimate of sampling error. To double-check on our assessment
of sampling error and especially as a further robustness check on our inferences
about the presence of excess-predictability, we bootstrap 2-tailed confidence intervals
for the coefficient of determination of the estimated predictive regressions. This
allows us to take sampling error of the coefficient of determination into account
without having to rely on large sample asymptotics and the normality assumptions
made by Hosking (1979). To conduct our bootstrapping experiment, we estimate the
parameters of the chosen predictive ARMA(p,q) model and store the residuals. We
then re-sample 1,000 times, with replacement, blocks of 5 consecutive realizations
from the stored residuals time-series, i.e. we employ ‘block re-sampling’ to capture
any residual serial correlation not explained by the estimated predictive regression.
Using the time-series of the re-sampled residuals and the point estimates of the
predictive regression parameters, we generate 1,000 separate bootstrapped currency
return series, for which we then re-estimate the chosen predictive ARMA(p,q) model
and record the coefficient of determination R2. This generates a bootstrapped
distribution of the latter. This approach to bootstrapping is known as estimation-

15

On a related note, Kurz-Kim and Loretan (2007) show that, in the case of the well-known finite
sample F-distribution of the R2 under the null that the latter is zero, this might be a concrete danger
when the normality assumption fails and the regression variables have fat tails distributions, as it is
often the case for regressions involving currency returns.

based bootstrap. It has been introduced by Freedman and Peters (1984) and Peters
and Freedman (1984), and has been used by Karolyi and Kho (2004) to test the
profitability of momentum strategies.

In Table 5, we report monthly predictability upper bounds and bootstrapped
confidence intervals for the coefficient of determination of predictive regressions
estimated using monthly data. The predictive regressions are ARMA(5,2) and, for
comparison, more parsimonious ARMA(5,0). The predictive regressions are
estimated over the whole sample period and the three sub-periods 1971-1983, 19841995, and 1996-2006.

16

When the predictive model is ARMA(5,0), evidence of

excess-predictability is not particularly strong. When one considers the explanatory
power of the ARMA(5,2) models, however, the bootstrapped confidence intervals are
almost always in excess of the tightest bound, i.e. the bound corresponding to RRAV
= 2.5. The wider bound, i.e. the bound corresponding to RRAV = 5.0, is violated in the
case of CAD and JPY in the initial 1971-1982 sub-sample period and in the case of
JPY also in the final sub-sample period, i.e. in 1995-2006.

To interpret these results, it is useful to consider that, when the 95th percentile of the
bootstrapped coefficient of determination distribution exceeds the predictability
bound for a given risk aversion bound RRAV, an investor endowed with rational
expectations and RRA no larger than RRAV could have exploited currency
predictability to reliably (i.e., with 95 percent confidence) generate SRs in excess of
the square root of the predictability bound. For example, by exploiting the monthly

31

ARMA(5,2) predictability of AUD, JPY and CHF over the period 1971-2006 and
under RRAV = 2.5, such an investor could have earned excess-SRs at least as large as
the square root of 1.28 percent. This amounts to an excess-SR of 39.2 percent per
annum. Similar calculations show that the same investor could have earned excessSRs of 40.1, 44.0 and 38.6 percent over the periods 1971-1983, 1984-1995, 19962006, respectively, by exploiting the predictability of either currency in our sample
(except, of course, ECU/EUR over the initial sample period). The monthly
predictability of CAD and JPY over the period 1971-1983 and of JPY in 1996-2006
exceeds the predictability bound even under RRAV = 5.0. Thus, optimally exploiting
the monthly predictability of CAD and JPY over the period 1971-1983 and of JPY in
1996-2006 would have allowed for SRs in excess of 80.1 and 77.1 percent,
respectively.

The bootstrapped distributions of the coefficient of determination of predictive
regressions reported in Tables 5 provide stronger evidence of excess-predictability
than the estimates adjusted for Hosking’s (1979) sampling error reported in Table 4.
Both, however, suggest that an investor endowed with rational expectations could
have exploited predictability, over a number of portions of the 1971-2006 sample
period, to reliably generate SRs in excess of the good-deal thresholds corresponding
to RRAV = 2.5 or even RRAV = 5. Because the performance of strategies that exploit
monthly predictabilities is robust to transaction costs, this can be seen as evidence of
good-deal availability both before and after transaction costs. Such evidence becomes
weaker but does not entirely disappear in the more recent part of the sample period.
16

Tests for residual serial correlation are conducted using Ljung-Box (1978) Q-statistic.
32

This contrasts with the emerging view (in Taylor (2005) and Neely, Weller and
Ulrich (2007)) that the markets of the major currencies no longer allow for trading
profits.

8. Currency Predictability and the Investment Opportunity Set

To more explicitly assess to what extent predictability-based strategies expand the
investment opportunity set, we first combine the maximal SR strategies for the
individual currencies into an overall maximal SR strategy. We then compare the
performance of the latter to a benchmark currency management strategy, i.e. the AFX
index introduced by Lequeux and Acar (1998) and designed to track the performance
of technical analysis rules commonly followed by active currency managers.
Monthly values of this index are available from 1984 onwards. To take a
conservative stance on the amount of exploitable or detectable predictability, we
consider the maximal SR strategies that exploit the predictability implied by
parsimonious ARMA(5,0) models of monthly currency returns. We denote by r* the
excess return on the overall maximal SR strategy. The weights with which the
maximal SR strategies for the individual currencies enter the overall maximal SR
strategy, normalized to sum to one and reported in the first column of Table 6, are
calculated as follows:

−1

w* = Σ * µ *

(14)

33

Here, Σ * denotes the variance-covariance matrix of the returns on the individual
currencies maximal SR strategies and µ * denotes the vector of their unconditional
expected returns. As reported in the second column of Table 6, the SR of r* is
considerably higher than the SR of the individual currencies maximal SRs strategies.
Especially in the more recent sub-sample period, it is also much higher than the SR
of the AFX currency management index. In fact, while the SR of the AFX currency
management index is lower in 1996-2006 than in 1986-2006, the SR of r* is actually
much higher in the more recent sub-sample period. As shown in Table 7, the
correlation of the AFX index and r* drops from 52.36 percent in 1985-1990 to just
over 41 percent in 2003-2006. During the same time, while the SR of the AFX index
becomes negative, the SR of r* exceeds 106 percent per annum.

Taken together, these results suggest that the combination of moving-average rules
and currencies considered by the AFX index does not fully capture the estimated
amount of currency predictability, especially in recent times. Figure 5 shows the
rolling 12-month SR of the AFX index and r*. These series move remarkably closely
until about 1996 but subsequently their correlation breaks down. As shown in Table
7, their correlation becomes negative in 2003-2006. This suggests that, while the
excess-profitability of the specific moving average rules considered by the AFX
index might have dried up as market participants have employed them in their trading
strategies, alternative and not yet fully exploited sources of excess-profitability have
emerged and manifest themselves as excess-predictability. Again, this is consistent

34

with the Adaptive Market Hypothesis (AMH) perspective put forth by Lo (2004) and
advocated, in a currency market setting, by Neely, Weller and Ulrich (2007).

Finally, we take an explicit asset pricing perspective and we ask whether maximal SR
predictability-based strategies are spanned by known equity market factors, which
some studies suggest span the investment opportunity set. To this end, we simply
regress the excess return on each one of the individual currencies maximal SR
strategies, the overall SR strategy and, for comparison, the AFX currency
management index against the Fama and French (1993) factors, i.e. we estimate

ri ,t = α i + β i ,m rm,t + β i ,SMB SMBt + β i , HML HMLt + ε i ,t

(15)

Here, ri ,t is the excess return on either the overall maximal SR strategy, rt*, an
individual currency maximal SR strategy or the AFX currency management index,

α i denotes the regression intercept, rm,t , SMBt and HMLt are the excess-returns on
the Fama and French (1993) market, size and book-to market factor mimicking
portfolios, respectively, and β i ,m , β i , SMB and β i , HML denote their corresponding
factor loadings, while ε i ,t denotes the regression error term. As shown in Table 6, the
maximal SR strategies for a number of individual currencies and the overall maximal
SR strategy offer a positive and statistically significant αi, especially over the period
1984-2006. Perhaps more interestingly, the factor loadings on these strategies are
always either very small and statistically insignificant or negative and statistically
significant. This implies that the strategies either carry little systematic risk or they
35

act as a hedge against the latter.17 This fact, coupled with the sign and magnitude of
the factor loadings and the significance of the ‘alpha’ terms, suggest that the
strategies that exploit currency predictability expand the investment opportunity set,
i.e. they are not spanned by the Fama and French (1993) factors.

To formally test whether this is the case, we use the ‘alphas’ of these strategies to
compute a Gibson, Ross and Shanken (1989) test-statistic, i.e. we form

GRS =

[

]

−1
T −N−K
1 + E ( f )′Ω −1 E ( f ) α ′Σ −1α ~ FK ,T − N − K
K

(16)

Here, T is the sample size, N is the number of factors f, E () denotes the
unconditional expectation operator, Ω denotes the factor variance-covariance matrix,

α is the vector of the intercepts from (15), and Σ is the variance-covariance matrix
of the strategies residuals not explained by the factor model, i.e. the error terms εt in
(15).

In our application, there are 6 maximal SR strategies that exploit the predictability of
AUD, CAD, JPY, GBP, CHF and ECU/EUR and thus K = 6, while the factors f are
the excess-returns on the Fama and French (1993) market, size and book-to market
factor mimicking portfolios and thus N = 3. The GRS statistics for the periods 19862006 and 1996-2006, reported in the last column of Table 6, are both highly
statistically significant. In computing (16), we estimate population moments using
17

A recent study by Burnside, et al. (2006) also shows that currency returns are uncorrelated with
36

their sample counterparts. Gibson, Ross and Shanken (1989) demonstrate that
comparing the GRS statistic with the 5 percent critical value of its finite sample
distribution (under the null that pricing errors equal zero), i.e. the F distribution with
K and T − N − K degrees of freedom, amounts to testing whether the factors are on
the ex-post mean-variance frontier. The significance of the GRS statistic in our tests
thus implies that the Fama and French (1993) factors do not span the predictabilitybased strategies and, therefore, that the latter expand the efficient frontier, at least
from the point of view of a rational mean-variance investor.

9. Conclusions, Final Remarks and Future Work

In this paper, we assess the statistical and, more importantly, economic significance
of predictability in currency returns over the period 1971-2006. We find that, even
under a relatively wide bound on relative risk aversion, predictability often violates
the attendant theoretically motivated upper bound. Closer scrutiny reveals that the
performance of strategies that attempt to optimally exploit daily predictability is very
sensitive to the level of transaction costs and this limits the extent to which it can be
exploited to generate genuine “good deals.” On the other hand, the performance of
strategies that attempt to optimally exploit monthly predictability is robust to
moderate yet realistic level of transaction costs. Taken at face value, this evidence
implies the availability of “good deals,” at least at the monthly frequency, and thus
violation of the EMH under a broad class of asset pricing models, for conservative
values of the marginal investor’s relative risk aversion and for realistic levels of
other asset classes.

transaction costs. Excess-predictability is highest in the 1970s and, for most
currencies in our sample, tends to decrease over time without disappearing. In
addition, we find that strategies based on monthly predictability expand the
investment opportunity set, even after transaction costs. This effect is also present in
the latter part of the sample period and, crucially, it does not disappear after the mid1990s, contrary to the conclusions of several recent studies. Taken together, our
findings pose a challenge to the EMH but they are consistent with Lo’s (2004)
AMH.18

Offering confirmation that technical trading is still alive in the currency domain,
Pojarliev and Levich (2008) have shown that currency hedge funds, behave as if they
follow standard technical trading strategies. Over the 1990-2006 period, the authors
show that a technical trading factor was the single most significant explanatory
variable of currency hedge fund returns. The returns of currency hedge funds were
significantly correlated with the AFX index over the 1990-2006 period. The
relationship declined somewhat over a 2001-06 sub-sample, but remained highly
significant. And in the present 2008 financial crisis, Deutsche Bank (2008) reports
that this year their technical trading currency benchmark has earned 8.8% over
LIBOR through October 20, similar to magnitudes observed in the 1970s and 1980s.

18

On a similar note, Lo (2005) offers, on pp. 35-36, a suggestive discussion of the cyclical behaviour
of the first-order autocorrelation of the S&P Composite Index. In particular, on p. 35, Lo (2005)
argues: “Rather than the inexorable trend to higher efficiency predicted by the EMH, the AMH
implies considerably more complex market dynamics, with cycles as well as trends, and panics,
manias, bubbles, crashes and other phenomena that are routinely witnessed in natural market
ecologies. These dynamics provide the motivation for active management.”
38

A possible avenue of future research is a more formal investigation of whether the
estimated R2 series contains a time trend, a cyclical component and one or more
structural breaks. Considering cross-rates and a wider sample of countries, possibly
including emerging economies, might also allow the estimation of possible time
trends and structural breaks, perhaps adopting a panel approach. A random
coefficient model, along the lines of Swamy (1970), would appear particularly
promising to accommodate the difficulty of modelling possible sources of crosssectional variation in the predictability of currency returns. These extensions would
make it possible to better address the important question of whether predictability in
excess of a level that can be judged consistent with the EMH has become milder over
time as a result of learning by economic agents, or whether excess-predictability
exhibits a persistently cyclical pattern that can be more easily explained by Lo’s
(2004) AMH.

Notes. These figures plot the sequences of the percentage coefficients of determinations (shown by the dotted line) of rolling AR(5) auto-regressions for each
currency in our sample against their upper bound (shown by the solid line). The latter is computed under a relative risk aversion upper bound of 5. The
estimation window of each auto-regression is one year and the sample period is 1971-2006. The values of all the series have been cut off at 2.0 to improve
visual clarity.

maximal SR strategies that exploit the predictability of daily and monthly,
respectively, Canadian Dollar returns, based on estimates from an ARMA(5,0)
model for daily returns and ARMA(5,2) for monthly returns. The weights are
rescaled in such a way that they add up to 1 over the 1995-2006 sample period.

Notes. This Table reports percentage annualized Sharpe ratios of strategies that
optimally exploit estimated predictability of daily and monthly currency returns, as
a function of various levels of transaction costs (in basis points in the top row). The
estimated daily predictive regression models are ARMA(5,0) for all currencies. The
estimated monthly predictive regression models are ARMA(5,2) for all currencies.
The last two columns report the annualized maximal SR bounds under RRA upper
bounds equal to 2.5 and 5. The SR bound is computed by taking the square root of
the predictability bound and annualizing. One and two asterisks are used to draw
attention to SRs in excess of the bound corresponding to RRA = 2.5 and RRA = 5,
respectively.

Notes. These figures plot, for each point in our sample period and each currency in our sample, the percentage BVI adjusted for Hosking’s (1979) sampling error, i.e.
BVIi,adj. based on rolling ARMA(5,2) predictive regressions and a RRA upper bound of 5, i.e. RRAV = 5. The estimation window of each autoregression is 5 years of
monthly data from 1971 to 2006. The solid and dotted lines in bold are a 12-month moving average and a linear interpolation, respectively, of the BVI series. The
estimation is conducted using the Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb and Shanno method described in Press et al. (1988).

Notes. This table reports, for six sample periods of about equal length, the percentage coefficient of
determination of ARMA(5,2) predictive regressions estimated using monthly data, together with Hosking’s
(1979) statistic and associated p-value under the null that RRA = 2.5 and RRA = 5, and the corresponding
percent γadj, computed as the square root of the annualized BVI – 1.64 × s.e.(R2). One and two asterisks are
used to draw attention to when Hosking’s (1979) statistic is significant at the 10 and 5 percent 47
level,
respectively. The estimation method is maximum likelihood.

Notes. The first two rows of this table report monthly percentage unconditional upper
bounds on the explanatory power of predictive regressions under a relative risk aversion
upper bound equal to 2.5 and 5, respectively. The other rows report, for each currency,
the bootstrapped 90 percent two-tailed confidence intervals (in percentage) for the
predictive regression coefficient of determination. The bootstrapping experiment is
conducted by re-sampling 1,000 times, in blocks of 5 at a time, the residuals of the
estimated monthly predictive model. The latter is AR(5), for the top panel, and
ARMA(5,2) for the bottom panel. The sample periods are 1971-2006 and three subsamples of about equal length, 1971-1982, 1983-1994, 1995-2006. In the table, one and
two asterisks denote when the upper bound is violated at the significance level
corresponding to the value reported in the left-most column under a RRA bound of 2.5
and 5, respectively.

Notes. The first column of this table reports the percentage weights w* with which the maximal Sharpe Ratio
predictability-based strategies for each currency enter the overall maximal Sharpe Ratio strategy, denoted by
r*. The second column reports annualized Sharpe ratios of these strategies and of the AFX currency
management index. The other columns reports the estimated intercept and factor loadings and, in brackets, the
associated t-static based on Newy and West (1987) autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity adjusted standard
errors. An asterisk denotes significance at the 5 percent level. The last column reports the GRS statistic (and its
p-value in brackets) for the 6 individual currencies maximal SR strategies. The hypothesized level of
transaction costs is two basis points per each way transaction and the predictive model, to simplify our
49 is
computational task, is ARMA(5,0) for all currencies. The data frequency of the underlying return series
monthly.
