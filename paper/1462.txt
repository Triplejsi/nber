The Persistence of Volatility and
Stock Market Fluctuations

ABSTRACT

This paper examines the potential influence of changing volatility in stock

market prices on the level of stock market prices. It demonstrates that volatility is only weakly serially correlated, implying that shocks to volatility do
not persist. These shocks can therefore have only a sinai]. impact on stock

market prices, since changes in volatility affect expected required rates of

return for relatively short intervals. These findings lead us to be skeptical
of recent claims that the stock market's poor performance during the 1970's can
be explained by volatility—induced increases in risk premia.

This paper examines the potential influence of changing stock market vola-

tility on the level of stock market prices. It demonstrates that volatility is
only weakly

serially

correlated, implying that shocks to volatility do not per-

sist. These shocks can

therefore

have only a small impact on stock market pri-

ces, since changes in volatility affect expected required rates of return for
only short

that

intervals. These findings lead us to be

skeptical of recent claims

the stock market's poor performance during the 19T0's can be explained by

volatility—induced increases in risk preinia, as suggested by Malkiel (19T9) and
Pindyck

(l981). They also lead us to doubt that fluctuations in risk premia

associated with changing return volatility can account for mach of the observed

variation in stock prices. The finding that volatility is not highly serially
correlated is puzzling in light of Black's (1976) observation that stock market
returns and changes in volatility are negatively correlated.

The paper is divided into five sections. The first clarifies the theoretical relationship between return volatility, the level of share prices, and

required rates of return. The second section examines the time series properties of stock market volatility as measured using both monthly and daily data.

The results suggest that although volatility is serially correlated, changes In
current volatility should have only a negligible impact on volatility forecasts

over Intervals as short as one or two years. The third and fourth sections use
data on

the

implied volatilities in option premia to re—examine the persistence

question, and again find evidence of only weak serial correlation. The conclu—
sion discusses the implications of our results for alternative explanations of
recent stock market movements and for our understanding of the sources of asset

price fluctuations sore generally.

could

be relaxed easily. Because of the nature of the volatility

estimates used in our empirical work, we use a discrete time formulation.

Not ice that the absolute value of the derivative of share prices with respect to

current volatility rises with P1. This result is intuitively natural. If
increases in volatility are

expected

to persist, they viii have a greater impact

on the discount factors applied to future cash flows, and therefore on share
prices.

In order to examine possible relationships between volatility and the level
of share prices, it is useful to insert some plausible parameter values into
(is). The mean annual return on coinxn stocks for the period 19148_1983 was

ii.6 percent.i The mean nominal return on Treasury bills was 1e.6 percent per

year over the same period, implying an average value of 7.0 percent for a. The
average real

return

on Treasury bills, which we use to estimate

r, was

per.-

cent. The estimated variance of the market return, expressed at annual rates,
ranged from 26.83 in i964 to 638.57 in i971, averaging 238.3. The last sta—
tistic In conjunction with the mean estimate for a implies a value of .029

for

Merton (1980) estimated this parameter to be .032 for the period 1952—1978.

The growth rate of nominal dividends on the S&P 500 during the 19148.-1983 period

was

5.2

percent annually. Combining this with our inflation rate of 4.2 percent

yields an average growth rate for real dividends, g, of .01.

The effect of changes in volatility

a monthly auto—

is clear that if fluctuations in volatility are to play a significant role in

explaining market fluctuations, then P1 must be quite large. The next two sec.-

tions examine the serial correlation properties of several measures of volati-

lity.

and 1948—83. It is immediately clear from the autocorrelogram and partial auto—
correlogram that there is no substantial positive serial correlation in market

volatility. For the 1948—1983 period, the first order autocorrelation coefficient is only .114; for the longer 1926—83 period, it is .675.

The high

autocorrelation coefficient for the whole period is sensitive to the inclusion

of the Depression years In the data sample. The

for

first order autocorrelation for

the 1940—1983 period, the estimate

declines to .05. Results similar to those for the postwar period were obtained

Source: Annual volatility estimates were calculated as the average of twelve
squared monthly values of the return on common stocks minus the return
Treasury bills. These data were drawn from Ibbotson (19814) for the
period 1926—1983, a total of 696 observations. The second sample, for
the 19148—1983 period, contains 1432 observations. Standard errors are

using data for only the 1960—1983 period, when the estimated first order serial

correlation coefficient was .131. The hypothesis that annual volatility was a

no great persistence in volatility, and indicate that the simple first

order autoregressive model used in the preceding section's theoretical develop-

ment fits the data quite vell.5 Higher order models did not yield appreciably
smaller sums of squared residuals for either sample period under consideration.

The point estimates of Pifor each sample period are substantially less
than unity. They imply that volatility shocks do not persist for long periods.
For the 1926—1983 sample perod, where we find the greatest amount of persistence, ninety percent of a volatility shock will have dissipated tr six years

after the shock. In the AR(2) case for this period, only four years are
required. The half life of the shock, the time required to move half way back
to the long—run equilibrium, is two years for both processes. In the postwar
period, the implied half life is much shorter ——

less than one year.6 These

results confirm Schmalensee and Trippi's (19T8) findings of relatively little
persistence in volatility for individual firms.

The estimated autocorrelations all suggest little persistence in volatility, and conventional t—tests reject the hypothesis that volatility is a random

Our analysis so far has assumed that market volatility can be modelled as a
stationary time series. Some research, however, has suggested that volatility

may trend over time. If so, this would imply that our estimated autocorrela—
tions are biased upwards. The equations in rows 3,4,7, and 8

of

Table 2 present

simple tests for the existence of trends over various sample periods. They
suggest a positive trend for the time period 1948—1983, and a negative trend for

1926—1983. However, the findings also show that the null hypothesis of no trend
cannot be rejected in the 1948—1983 period cannot be rejected.
These results contradict Pindyck's (1984) claim that there has been a clear

upward trend in market volatility over the last thirty years. He pre—snooths
monthly volatility estimates by computing twelve-month noving averages before

looking for trends, and this makes his conclusions difficult to evaluate. Even
if there were trends, however, it is important to recognize that only unexpected

deviations from trend should affect asset returns. If the trend rate of volatility growth rises abruptly, that should lead to a one—time adjustment in share
prices, but it cannot account for a low rate of return over an extended period.

2.2

Volatility Estimates Based on Daily

Data -

Our second volatility estimator was based on daily data; it follows closely
on

Merton's

(1980) estimator.S Using daily returns on the Standard and Poor's

s is the daily return adjusted for non—trading days. In daily

data,

measuring the returns around the risk—free rate would have virtually no effect

on the estimated volatilities •

The

twenty—one trading day intervals which we

use correspond roughly to nxnths of calendar time.

The autocorrelogram and partial autocorrelogram for this volatility estimator are shown in Table 3. In this case, the data clearly exhibit positive

serial correlation. Again, the persistence of volatility is relatively unimportant from an economic perspective. The first order autocorrelation coefficient obtained using xnth1y data is .596, which is equivalent to an
autocorrelation coefficient of only (.596)12, or .002, in annual data. This is
not inconsistent with the estimates obtained using the post—var monthly volati-

lity data in the last section, since we could not reject the null hypothesis
that there was no serial correlation in volatility.
Table 14 shows estimated autoregressive models for the volatility series

calculated from daily data. Once again, the first or second order autoregressive process provides an adequate description of the data. The hypothesis

that the coefficients on all

variables

lagged more than two periods equalled

zero could never be rejected. Higher lagged terms have small, as well as statistically insignificant, coefficients. None of the estimates of P3 or pl ever
exceeded .10 in absolute value. The tests against the null hypothesis of P1=1

again clearly reject the hypothesis that volatility follows a random walk. The
half life for a shock in the A.R(i) model is less than three months.

The CBOE Index does not correspond to the option premium of any traded

security.

It is a measure of this option premium on the "representative share"

for which options are traded on the CBOE. As such, the implied volatility
should be substantially higher than the volatility of the market, since the

market is a weighted average of many imperfectly correlated shares. While our

estimates of

the implied volatility on a

representative

share are not directly

comparable to the volatilities estimated in the last section, our assumption is

that their serial correlation properties should be

reasonably

similar.11

The CBOE Index is standardized to apply to an option on a stock with a

the strike price is $140.00 as well. The weekly data on the CBOE Index, as well
as our estimates of the implied volatilities, are shown in the Data Appendix.

The movements our implied volatilities were compared with those of six—

month ex post volatilitles estimated from daily returns on the S&P 500; the two
series cohere reasonably well. FIgure 1 shows the novments In these two series,

Source: Estimates of volatility forecasts were determined by inverting the
Black—Scholes option valuation formula to obtain the volatility implied
by CBOE option premia indices. These data were available for the period

earlier conclusions that

volatility

changes are not persistent. One year after

a shock to volatility, expected volatility will exceed its mean by only

(.971)52

-.22, or twenty two percent, of the initialshock. The partial autocorrelogramagain suggests that a first order autoregressive representation is appropriate
for this series.

The statistical insignificance of partial autocorrelations at

lags of more than one week is indicative of an AR(l) structure in these data.

Table 6 reports estimates of several time series models for these data.
Equations for our entire data period, comprising 14e1 weeks, are reported in

the first four rows of the table. The hypothesis that the residuals from the
AR(1) model are white noise is nearly rejected at standard levels, as shown by

the reported Q—statistics. The AR(2) results do not suffer from this difficulty. The higher order (third and fourth order) eutocorrelation parameters
are never statistically significant. The implied responses to a volatility
shock

life

are similar in all of the estimated models. They suggest that the half
for a volatility shock is about six months.l3 Although the estimated weekly

autocorrelation is near unity, the last column of the table shows that the

hypothesis of a unit

root

is still rejected in each case.

Because each weekly observation on the CBOE Index depends on forecasts of

volatility for each of the next twenty six weeks, two consecutive observations
on the implied volatility will have twenty five weeks of forecast volatilities
in common.

This

uy bias our estimated autocorrelations. We therefore esti-

mated autoregressive models using non—overlapping data periods, corresponding to

every twenty—sixth observation in our data set. The estimated AR(1) and AB(2)

models are reported in the last two rows of the table. The estimated six-month

1, The Term Structure of Implied Volatilities

The CBOE Call Option Index data provide strong support for the transient
character

of

volatility- shocks. However, they do not permit us to directly

-

investigate how long—term expectations of volatility respond to changing short-

term volatility expectations. A second source of option data can illuminate
this issue. Since 1979, Valueline has computed indices of option premia at

three and six month nturities. We inverted these option premia indices using
the same procedure which we applied to the CBOE data.114

The availability of two different maturity option indices provides an
opportunity

for additional tests of the persistence hypothesis. The implied

volatility for the six month options was assumed to equal the average of the
expected three month volatilities for the next three months as veil as the three
months following them:

=
t,6°t

t,3°t + t,3t+l3'2

•

(18)

In this notation, s,k° is the volatility expected to prevail, as of time t, over
the k months beginning in week s. The assumption in (i8) allows us to solve for
an estimate of the implied forward volatility which is expected to prevail for

the

three month period beginning three months from the current week:
"2
t+13,30t

2t,6°t —

(19)

We can use the estimated forward volatilities to study the change in the

implied forward volatility which occurs when the current three—month "SpOt"

implied

volatility changes.

The results of this estimation are shown below:

(20)

These results indicate that when current volatility expectations change,

expected volatility in future periods also changes. However, they also constitute further evidence for our contention that volatility shocks are not per-

sistent. One year after a volatility shock, these estimtes imply

that

only

seven percent of a shock 'will still persist. The half life of a volatility

shock according to these data is just over three nrnths. One year after a ten
percent shock to volatility-, the three—month forecast of volatility would only

be 1.3 percent greater than in the initial period.

25—

Conclusions

and Implications

Our findings suggest that shocks to stock market volatility are not persistent. This is illustrated in Figure 2, which shows the impulse response
functions corresponding to several of the estimated time series models for volatility. These functions, which show

process,

the

moving average representation of each

depict the evolution of volatility following a "shock" equal to ten

percent of the steady—state value of volatility. While the speed with which the
shock dissipates varies across models, the half

life

of the shock never exceeds

two years. For the equations corresponding to the CBOE and daily

volatility

estimators, the half—life of a volatility shock is less than half a year.

Our empirical results suggest that changes in volatility should affect
expected required returns for periods not substantially greater than two years.

This means that they can

only have

a very

limited

impact on the level of share

prices. A doubling of volatility would reduce the level of the market by only
about nine percent.].5 Since actual volatility fluctuations are usually smaller
than this, we doubt that changing volatility accounts for any large fraction of

market fluctuations. This observation applies both to the problem of explaining
recent events and to the deeper problem of explaining the sources of stock price
fluctuations

Our work deepens the puzzle of explaining the strong negative correlation,
observed by Black (1976) and Schinalensee and Trippi (19T8), between stock market

returns and volatility.

Black (1976) showed that the inverse correlation

between volatility and returns was so strong that a positive one percent return

on a stock implied more than a one percent reduction in volatility; this

implies that raising the share price actually reduces the dollar volatility of

the

stock. The finding that volatility is not highly persistent

autonomous

suggests that

changes 'in volatility should have only a relatively small effect on

share prices. It Black's

(19T6)

"leverage

effect" explanation of the rela-

tionship between returns and volatility were correct, then one would expect to

observe that volatility, like prices, would follow a random walk.
One possible explanation for the observed data is that the same events
which sake the returns to capital more uncertain also reduce their expected

value. This coincidence in the arrival of stochastic shocks would lead to an
apparent relationship between volatility changes and

share

prices, although in

fact no such causal link exists. Another possibility is that when adversity
strikes, firms are expected to respond with new strategies. Between the time
the market anticipates that some new policy will be chosen and the time this
policy is actually announced, uncertainty and therefore volatility may

increase.

1. These data are based

on Ibbotson (1981e).

2. To the extent that there is measurement error in our estimates of volatility, the estimated serial correlation coefficients ny be biased downward. In
the next section we use estimates of volatility expectations which are less
susceptible to these difficulties.
3. Mci-ton (1980) observes that although estimators of the variance which
center the estimated returns around a point which is not their sanle mean will
be biased, these biases are trivial. He estimates variances using uncentered
returns; Pindyck (1984) estimates variances for twelve lx)nth periods by com-

puting second noments centered around the overall mean return in his sample.

We

used Box—Jenkins (1970) Q—statistlcs to test the null hypothesis of no

serial correlation of up to fifth order. The values of the test statistics were
32.9 for the 1926—1983 period, 14.70 for 1948—1983, and 4.147 for 1960—1983. The
critical value for rejecting the null hypothesis of at the .05 level is 12,59.
5. The finding that low—order autoregressive processes provide an
description of the variance of market returns suggest that it may be

adequate
possible to
apply the econometric techniques for time—varying heteroscedasticity, suggested
by Engle(1982), when studying the behavior of security returns.

6. The same conclusion emerged when we examined changes in volatility. This

covariance and not the level of the volatility series, and the former is unaffected by multiplication by a constant, we did not make the correction.
