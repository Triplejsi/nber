Life (evaluation), HIV/AIDS, and Death in Africa

NBER Working Paper No. 14637

JEL No. I12,J17,O15
ABSTRACT
We use data from the Gallup World Poll and from the Demographic and Health Surveys to investigate
how subjective wellbeing (SWB) is affected by mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, including mortality
from HIV/AIDS. The Gallup data provide direct evidence on Africans’ own emotional and evaluative
responses to high levels of infection and of mortality. By comparing the effect of mortality on SWB
with the effect of income on SWB, we can attach monetary values to mortality to illuminate the often
controversial question of how to value life in Africa. Large fractions of the respondents in the World
Poll report the mortality of an immediate family member in the last twelve months, with malaria typically
more important than AIDS, and deaths of women in childbirth more important than deaths from AIDS
in many countries. A life evaluation measure (Cantril’s ladder of life) is relatively insensitive to the
deaths of immediate family, which suggests a low value of life. There are much larger effects on experiential
measures, such as sadness and depression, which suggest much larger values of life. It is not clear
whether either of these results is correct, yet our results demonstrate that experiential and evaluative
measures are not the same thing, and that they cannot be used interchangeably as measures of “happiness”
in welfare economics.

1. Introduction
The HIV/AIDS epidemic has brought large increases in morbidity and mortality to many
countries in sub-Saharan Africa. For some countries, the epidemic has eliminated the
large gains in life expectancy that took place between 1950 and 1990. More than 20
million Africans are estimated to be HIV positive, and between one and a half and two
million die from AIDS every year. In the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal, it
has been estimated that more than half of women aged between 25 and 29 are HIV
positive, Welz et al (2007), and according to data from the Demographic and Health
Surveys, national infection rates in Zimbabwe are more than thirty percent for women
aged 30 to 39 and men aged 35 to 44. According to data from the 2006 wave of the
Gallup World Poll, more than 80 percent of people in Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Uganda,
Zambia, and Zimbabwe reported knowing someone who had died of AIDS. In the 2007
wave, more than a third of respondents in Uganda and Tanzania reported having lost an
immediate family member to AIDS in the last year.
In the context of this epidemic, we use the African data from the Gallup World Poll,
supplemented with information from the African Demographic and Health Surveys, to
look at the links between disease and self-reported wellbeing. Among the measures we
examine is an overall life-evaluation measure, Cantril’s (1965) ladder of life, as well as
measures of emotion or affect, including sadness, depression, happiness, and enjoyment.
These data provide direct evidence on the emotional and hedonic impact of one of
history’s most serious epidemics as reported by those who are directly experiencing it.
The World Poll also contains a set of questions about the perceived importance of
HIV/AIDS relative to other factors restricting wellbeing, and we use these, together with

1

the wellbeing questions, to investigate the importance that Africans place on HIV/AIDS
compared with other factors in their lives, such as other diseases, as well as income,
poverty, employment, and education.
We use this information to address two distinct questions. The first is the value of life
in sub-Saharan Africa, a topic that has long been controversial. We use self-reported
wellbeing measures to calculate the change in income required to compensate people for
the reduction in wellbeing associated with the death of an immediate family member. The
second question concerns the self-reported wellbeing measures themselves. Is it
legitimate to use them as a basis for calculating compensation? Beyond that, can selfreported wellbeing, or “happiness,” the blanket term often used in the literature, serve as
an adequate guide to wellbeing in designing policies for public health and social welfare?
The use of self-reported wellbeing measures to calculate compensation for the death
of relatives has previously been recommended by Oswald and Powdthavee (2009). Their
paper is part of a literature that uses self-reported wellbeing measures to calculate the
income compensation associated with non-monetized factors such as the value of
informal care (van den Berg and Ferrer-i-Carbonell, 2007), airport noise (van Praag and
Baarsma, 2005), and urban renewal (Dolan and Metcalfe, 2008, who argue that these
measures will often be superior to direct assessment of willingness-to-pay). In earlier
work using the Gallup World Poll, one of us found a strong positive—and approximately
linear—relationship between average national life-evaluation and the logarithm of
national income but, conditional on income, could find no effect of life expectancy, or of
the national prevalence of HIV infection (Deaton, 2008). If this finding is correct—and
the more comprehensive analysis here will suggest that it is, at least if we confine

2

ourselves to the life-evaluation measure—it would appear that Africans require little
compensation for the consequences of the epidemic and attach relatively little priority to
dealing with it. Such a finding has implications for a number of important topics,
including the design of foreign assistance for Africa, and more broadly, the measurement
of the level and distribution of international wellbeing using measures that incorporate
both health and income. We shall address these issues in the final section of the paper.
Our findings are also important for the “happiness” literature, about the meaning of
measures of self-reported wellbeing, and about how and whether they can be used in
assessing welfare and in directing public policy. The African results show that the death
of immediate family members has little effect on life evaluation, but a substantial effect
on measures of negative affect, such as depression and sadness. These results show that
different measures of wellbeing, although correlated, are by no means the same thing;
measures of life evaluation capture different aspects of experience than do measures of
affect. The sums of money required to compensate affect for the death of a family
member are much larger than those required to compensate life evaluation. In
consequence, it is not legitimate to subsume both into a blanket measure of “happiness,”
let alone to use them more or less interchangeably as the practical counterparts of
Benthamite utility and as a guide to utilitarian public policy. In the final section we argue
that while measures of both life evaluation and affect are relevant for assessing
wellbeing, each is seriously compromised as an exclusive guide.
The paper is laid out as follows. Section 2 uses data on HIV prevalence from the
Demographic and Health Surveys together with data on self-reported wellbeing from the
Gallup World Poll. Within countries in both data sets, we match means by sex and age

3

group. These calculations are designed to reexamine and extend to sub-national
aggregates the aggregate results in Deaton (2008), who found no effect of national health
measures on average life evaluation across countries. In Section 3, we move to micro data
from the World Poll, and look at the consequences for subjective wellbeing (SWB) of
knowing someone who has died of HIV/AIDS (2006 survey), or of having a family
member who died in the previous year (2007 survey). We compare these effects to the
effects of higher income, placing a monetary value on the health outcomes. Following
Tortora (2008), we also summarize the results of questions about the importance that
people attach to dealing with various problems—such as joblessness, poverty, education,
and disease—and compare these with the results of the hedonic regressions. Section 4
discusses the implications of our findings.
In the remainder of this section, we briefly describe the African data from the Gallup
World Poll on which our analysis is based. We use data from the 2006 and 2007 waves of
the Poll, which is a representative survey of adults from countries around the world.
Samples of around 1,000 adults are drawn from each country; 140 countries in 2006 and
150 in 2007. In developing countries, including all of those we cover here, data are
collected in face-to-face interviews. In both years the surveys almost always covered
more than 95 percent of the population age 15 or over in each country. An example of
where this coverage did not occur is in Angola where areas with landmines were not
surveyed. Typically, the frame consists of a list of Enumeration Areas used by the
country’s central statistical office, from which primary sampling units (PSUs) were
selected by Gallup. In each country, the PSUs are stratified into six strata, from those in
cities of more than a million people to the very few rural areas with a population less than

4

10,000, and are selected with probability proportional to population within each stratum.
One hundred and twenty five PSUs are selected within each country, and eight interviews
are obtained in each. A random route procedure is used to select households and the Kish
Grid is used to select one respondent, age 15 or older, at random from each selected
household. The Gallup World Poll covers more than 90 percent of the population of subSaharan Africa as a whole. A core set of questions, including questions on wellbeing,
education, and income, is asked in every country. There are also questions that are
different in each region, and the questions about death from HIV/AIDS and other
diseases are asked only in sub-Saharan Africa, where 32 countries were covered by either
or both of these two waves.

2. HIV infection and wellbeing in Africa
Deaton (2008) found that, conditional on the logarithm of national income, national HIV
prevalence is uncorrelated with mean life evaluation. In this section, we use better data on
HIV prevalence from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) to investigate in more
detail the link between HIV and life evaluation within some of the most highly-affected
countries. We also broaden the set of outcomes to include measures of affect, including
enjoyment, smiling, sadness, and depression. We use HIV-related data drawn from the
DHS for fourteen countries in sub-Saharan Africa: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ethiopia,
Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Zambia, and
Zimbabwe. In these fourteen countries, a recent wave of the DHS has included the
collection of blood samples for HIV testing. These blood samples, as well as responses to
the individual questionnaire, yield information about HIV prevalence, HIV knowledge,

5

and perceived HIV risk. HIV prevalence estimates from these data are arguably the best
estimates available. The data from the DHS is described in the data notes at the end of the
paper.
Table 1 shows, separately for each country, three measures of HIV from the DHS—
HIV prevalence, the fraction of respondents who say that they know someone who has
AIDS or has died of AIDS, and the fraction of respondents who say that they are at
moderate or higher risk of being infected with HIV. The last five columns show national
average levels of life evaluation, enjoyment, smiling, sadness, and depression, calculated
using data from the Gallup World Poll. Life evaluation is measured using the Cantril
ladder, which ranges from 0, “the worst possible life,” to 10, “the best possible life”; we
shall refer to points on this evaluative ladder as “rungs” or “steps,” of which there are
eleven, from 0 to 10. Enjoyment, sadness, and depression are indicators for whether, on
the previous day, the respondent experienced these emotions a lot of the day. Smiling is
an indicator for whether the respondent reported smiling and laughing a lot on the
previous day. The national averages of these outcomes in Table 1 show no significant
correlations across countries between HIV prevalence and average levels of subjective
wellbeing.
Our approach here is to look within countries at the relationship between HIV and
measures of subjective wellbeing. In particular, we use individual-level HIV testing data
from the DHS for each country to calculate prevalence separately by sex for each of
seven five-year age-groups (spanning ages 15-49). Figure 1 provides an overview of what
drives our more detailed results. The first panel shows DHS estimates of HIV prevalence
for each age-group and sex, separately for high- and low-HIV prevalence countries. High

6

prevalence countries are those with prevalence above six percent (Kenya, Malawi,
Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe). The figure shows the high degree of variability in
HIV prevalence across countries and shows that, within countries, HIV infection is
strongly related to age and sex, with prevalence in high-HIV countries peaking among
women ages 30-34 and men ages 40-44.
The pattern by sex and age of averages of wellbeing measures—including life
evaluation, enjoyment, smiling, sadness, and depression—do not mirror the age profile in
HIV prevalence in any obvious way. The difference in mean wellbeing for a sex/agegroup between high and low HIV countries at the top of the third column of Figure 1
bears little relation to the sex/age-group pattern in HIV infection in other rows. The
figures show that adults in high HIV countries are more likely to report smiling and less
likely to report depression; women in high HIV countries report more enjoyment than
women in low HIV countries. Of course, the differences illustrated in Figure 1 could well
be driven by the fact that high HIV countries have other characteristics, such as better
economic conditions, that raise wellbeing.
In Table 2, we estimate the relationship between life evaluation and HIV, controlling
for other individual and country characteristics. Here (as elsewhere), we do not weight by
country population so that, for example, a person in Ghana gets the same weight as a
person in Nigeria. Standard errors are clustered at the country, sex, and age-group level.
Controlling for log GDP per capita, HIV prevalence in a country, sex, and age-group is
associated with lower life evaluation (Table 2, column 2). The coefficient is about a third
larger (more negative) in column 3, which also includes country fixed effects. The
addition of the sex dummy in column 4 does very little, as does the replacement of

7

national income by individual household income in column 5, although income itself has
a large positive effect on the ladder. These magnitudes imply that adults in a country, sex,
and age-group with prevalence of ten percent report life evaluation values about a tenth
of a rung lower than those in a country, sex, and age-group without HIV.
One problem with these estimates is that the previous literature has established the
existence of pronounced age-patterns in life evaluation, see for example Helliwell (2006)
or Blanchflower and Oswald (2008), who argue that there is a universal U-shape in life
evaluation with a minimum in middle-age. This is approximately the mirror image of the
age-pattern in HIV-prevalence (see Figure 1), so that it is possible that the results in
columns 2 and 3 are driven purely by a correlation in these age profiles. Since life
satisfaction is U-shaped in countries where HIV-prevalence is low or zero, we cannot
safely use these patterns in countries in Africa where the infection rate is high. To deal
with these concerns, we add controls for age groups. Our preferred specification is in
column (6), where we control for sex, log family income, age-group, and country. Here
the estimated coefficient, although negative, is no longer statistically significant. In a
check to see whether this finding might come from the small sample size, or range of
explanatory variables, we have repeated (but do not show) the regressions adding data
from Cambodia, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and India—for which there is also DHS
HIV testing data—and have found the same insignificant result.
Table 3 repeats the specification in the final column of Table 2, but with measures of
affect replacing the ladder measure of life evaluation. Controlling for sex, log income,
age-group, and country, HIV is not significantly associated with enjoyment, smiling, or
sadness, but is significantly associated with depression. Adults in a country, sex, and age-

8

group with HIV prevalence of ten percent, compared to adults in a country, sex, and agegroup without HIV, are about two percentage points more likely to report experiencing
depression a lot of the day on the previous day. In Appendix Tables A.1 and A.2, we
estimate these regressions substituting for HIV prevalence the fraction of adults who
report knowing someone who has AIDS or has died of AIDS. The results are broadly
consistent with the results in Tables 2 and 3, and the preferred specification (Table A.1,
column (6)) shows no significant relationship between life evaluation and HIV
knowledge. Likewise, and with the exception of smiling, HIV knowledge is unrelated to
the outcomes in Table A.2. Adults in country/sex/age-groups in which a higher fraction
know someone affected by AIDS are less likely to report smiling a lot on the previous
day. Appendix Tables B.1 and B.2, for which the sample sizes are admittedly much
smaller, likewise show little relationship between HIV—now measured as the fraction of
adults who report being at moderate or higher risk of being infected with HIV—and these
outcomes.
Overall, these results are indecisive, but they provide no clear evidence of strong
effects of HIV on any of the measures of self-reported wellbeing. But they can hardly be
taken to establish that HIV/AIDS has little effect on wellbeing: being HIV-positive is not
the same as having AIDS, and people who are infected may have no knowledge of the
fact. High rates of infection in the population may not imply an increase in morbidity for
respondents, especially if, in the absence of ARV therapy, survival times with full-blown
AIDS are short. Mortality from AIDS may also be attributed to other causes, especially in
populations where background adult mortality is high, so that group variation in infection
rates may not have a perceptible effect on group variation in life evaluation or affect, so

9

that we may be looking at the wrong variables. Moreover, the use of the two different
data sources means that we can only merge at the country, age-group and sex level. The
lack of individual-specific data is likely to reduce the precision of our estimates, and we
do not know for sure that the prevalence rate in one’s own sex and age-group is the one
that people are aware of or care about.

3. Wellbeing and mortality among individuals
In this section, we take a more direct approach by looking at the effects on respondents of
knowing someone who has died. In the 2006 sub-Saharan Africa module of the Gallup
World Poll, respondents were asked “Do you personally know anyone that has died from
X?” where X includes tuberculosis, malaria, HIV/AIDS, smallpox, polio, hepatitis, and
cholera. In the 2007 round, with an overlapping group of countries, the question was
changed to “Please tell me if any one in your immediate family has died from X in the
past 12 months?” where X includes the same diseases as before plus death from chronic
(more than six months) diarrhea and deaths of women in childbirth. In countries where
people often have little contact with doctors or clinics, some of these diagnoses are
manifestly unreliable, but at the least they provide an indication of how people perceive
the effects of these diseases. In interpreting the usefulness of these answers, it should also
be kept in mind that reliable data on adult mortality are almost completely absent in many
of the countries covered here, and even official estimates of mortality from HIV/AIDS
are little more than intelligent guesses based on small surveillance sites or projections
from infection rates from surveys or ante-natal clinics. Note also, that even where
qualified personnel are in attendance, cause of death is not easily ascertained, especially

10

when the decedent suffered from multiple diseases. In the current context, this is
particularly important for HIV/AIDS, which opens the way to opportunistic infections,
particularly tuberculosis, with which a large fraction of the population has long been
asymptomatically infected. A substantial fraction of what are recorded as deaths from TB
are likely attributable to HIV infection.
Table 4 lists the fractions of people in the 2006 wave who reported that they knew
someone who died of malaria, HIV/AIDS, and TB. In columns 4 and 5, we report the
fractions of people who know someone who died of either HIV/AIDS or of TB as well as
who died of any of the seven listed diseases, including also polio, hepatitis, smallpox, and
cholera. There are close to 1,000 respondents in each country. Clearly, these numbers
should be treated with great caution as indicators of mortality rates. For example, only
people with long memories could have known people who died of smallpox, yet in one or
two countries, smallpox is frequently listed, for example by 41 percent of respondents in
Chad, 20 percent in Sierra Leone, and 13 percent in Niger (not shown in the tables).
These figures are most likely indicative of the quality of these data from those countries.
Even so, the figures in Table 4 are broadly sensible; the correlations between column 2 or
column 4 on the one hand, and the UNAIDS (2008) estimates of mortality rates—
themselves subject to error—are 0.57 and 0.56. The combined TB and HIV/AIDS
numbers are probably the more accurate for AIDS deaths in the countries where the
epidemic is severe, but this would not be the case where HIV/AIDS prevalence is low, as
in most of West Africa.
One important feature of Table 4 is that respondents typically know more people who
died of malaria than who died of HIV/AIDS. This is true, not only where it is to be

11

expected, in the countries of West Africa where HIV/AIDS is relatively rare, such as
Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone,
and Togo, but it is also true, or within a point or two of being true, in some of the
countries where HIV/AIDS is most severe, such as Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi,
Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia. There is clearly substantial background mortality
from disease in Africa, even before the advent of HIV/AIDS.
Table 5 presents data from the 2007 wave of the Gallup World Poll on an overlapping
group of countries using the more focused question of whether respondents have lost a
member of their immediate family in the last twelve months. These data also include two
causes of death that were not asked in 2006, death of a family member in child birth, and
death of a family member to chronic diarrheal disease. The latter did not generate many
positive responses, and is not included in the table. The numbers in Table 5 are much
smaller than those in Table 4, as must be the case, and a few remain implausible, such as
the very high numbers for HIV/AIDS in Chad and the Central African Republic. The
correlation between column 2 and the UNAIDS-based estimates of mortality rates is now
only one third. However, perhaps the most important numbers are those in the fifth
column for women in the immediate family who have died in childbirth. For half of the
countries, particularly those in West Africa, these numbers are higher than the numbers
of family members dying from HIV/AIDS, though typically not higher than those dying
from malaria. Once again, there is a major cause of (at least perceived) mortality that is
currently present, and was present (and presumably more severe than now) long before
the advent of HIV/AIDS.

12

Table 6 presents the first evidence on the effects of having recently lost an immediate
family member on five measures of self-reported well-being. The measure of loss we
have used is whether the respondent has lost an immediate family member in the last
twelve months to one of (a) malaria, (b) TB, (c) HIV/AIDS, and (d) death in childbirth.
The World Poll does not have a question on all-cause mortality, and we have ignored the
other reported causes (hepatitis, cholera, polio, smallpox, and chronic diarrhea) because
the fractions reporting are very small, and because there are substantial numbers of
missing values from “don’t knows” or refusals. We look at five different measures of
wellbeing (described in Section 2): (a) the Cantril ladder of life, (b) enjoyment, (c)
smiling, (d) sadness, and (e) depression. Each of these measures captures a potentially
different aspect of feelings and of life assessment and we have no prior expectation that
they will respond in the same way to the deaths of family members.
Table 6 shows the differences in the SWB measures between people who report
having lost a family member and those who do not. Figures in bold are more than twice
their standard errors, computed taking into account the survey design. The results are
generally in the direction that would be expected: deaths of immediate family members
reduce the ladder value, reduce the probability of having smiled, laughed, or enjoyed
oneself yesterday, and increase the likelihood of experiencing sadness or depression. But
there are exceptions, a few of which are significantly different from zero (e.g., the
positive effect of a death on the ladder in Sudan, or on enjoyment in Kenya), and only
about a quarter of the differences are significantly different from zero. Sadness and
depression are the two most consistent of the indicators, with only two negative signs for

13

sadness (Senegal and Sudan) and four for depression (Benin, Kenya, Mozambique, and
Sudan), and these six differences are small and insignificantly different from zero.
We deal with the heterogeneity by pooling across countries, and by either running
regressions with country fixed effects, or by averaging the results over countries, taking
simple averages with each country as a data point. (Weighting by population would give
most of the weight to Nigeria.) In the fixed effect regression, we regress each SWB
measure on a dummy for a death and a set of country dummies. This regression also
yields an average of the country effects, but where each country difference is weighted by
the inverse of its estimated variance, so that more precisely estimated differences get
higher weights. Both numbers are shown in the bottom panel of Table 6. As it turns out,
the two sets of estimates are almost the same. Over sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, the
death of an immediate family member reduces the ladder values by 0.11 or 0.12 of a step,
the probability of enjoyment or smiling/laughter by 2 to 4 percentage points, and
increases the probability of experiencing sadness and depression by 5 to 6 percentage
points.
These estimates come from simple differences of averages in each country, with no
controls for other differences across people who have and have not lost a family member
in the last year. SWB is generally sensitive to demographic status, such as age and sex, as
well as to education and income, all of which could potentially confound the effects of a
death. As we shall see, education is positively related to SWB and more educated people
are more likely to be HIV positive in several of these countries (Fortson, 2008). Tables 7
and 8 move to a multivariate analysis, using the same outcomes as Table 6 (an 11 point
scale for the ladder, and linear probability models for the other SWB measures) and

14

including age, sex, education, and income as controls. As before, we present estimates
based on pooled regressions with country fixed effects (Table 7) and estimates that come
from estimating regressions for each country, and then averaging the coefficients (Table
8). Given that the World Poll data has about 1,000 observations for each country, the
estimation of separate regressions for each country is entirely feasible, and the averaging
recognizes that fact. Nor is it clear that when we average across countries, we wish to
give more weight to the more precisely estimated coefficients rather than counting each
country as a unit. Even so, Tables 7 and 8, while differing in detail, are remarkably
similar, so that little depends on which we use, and we have the comfort of knowing that
our results are robust to the choice of procedure.
For each measure of SWB, we present two regressions, one with and one without
income. We want to condition on income, which has consistently proved to be one of the
most powerful predictors of the ladder and of the affect measures in the World Poll, but
there are two countries here (Guinea and Mali) where we do not have useable income
data, and there are many missing observations within countries that do have income data,
so that we lose about a quarter of the sample size when income is introduced. By showing
regressions with and without income, we can check that the restriction of the sample does
not have a major effect on the results. We also note that the income measure comes from
a single question in which the individual respondent is asked to choose an income bracket
for family income. In sub-Saharan Africa—as in other poor, largely agricultural areas of
the world—such questions are unlikely to elicit more than an extremely imprecise
estimate of the usual concept of income. As a result, there is likely to be substantial
attenuation bias in the estimates of the effects of income. We work with the logarithm of

15

income; previous work by Deaton (2008) and by Stevenson and Wolfers (2008) has
shown that the logarithmic form works well both within and between countries, at least as
far as the ladder is concerned.
Table 7 presents the fixed effect regression results for the five SWB measures. All
coefficients and their t–values are shown, other than the country fixed effects. In each
case, the first column shows the estimates without income, and the second column shows
the estimates including the logarithm of income; the second column always has two
fewer countries. Of the non-mortality variables, education—whether the respondent has
eight or more years of completed schooling—and income have consistently positive
effects on life satisfaction and on reported emotions. More educated and higher income
people report higher values on the ladder of life, they are more likely to remember
laughing and smiling and enjoying themselves yesterday, and are less likely to remember
being sad or depressed. The effects of being better educated are similar in size to an
increase of one unit in the logarithm of income, which corresponds to a 172 percent
increase. Given the errors of measurement in the income variable, it would be a mistake
to interpret the tables as showing the separate effects of income and education since the
latter is likely to pick up at least some effects of the former.
The effects of gender and age are inconsistent and usually weak. In the World Poll in
general, women are more likely than men to report both more positive and more negative
emotion, but these results are not clearly apparent in these sub-Saharan African countries
and the significance of estimates depends on whether or not income is included. We do
not replicate the standard finding that life evaluation is U-shaped over the life-cycle,

16

though there is a U-shape for smiling and laughing (reaching the minimum around age
50), and (more weakly) for being depressed, with a minimum around age 40.
Our main results are in the first four rows which report the effects on well-being of
having lost an immediate family member in the last twelve months. The pattern of these
estimates differs sharply across the SWB measures as well as across causes of death
within the measures. The ladder of life is close to the life satisfaction or “happiness”
measure that is used by Layard (2005) and others to measure overall well-being. Yet the
loss of immediate family members has only a modest negative effect on the ladder.
Deaths from TB, malaria, and childbirth have negative effects, while a death from
HIV/AIDS has an apparent positive effect. The t–values for all of the estimates are
unimpressive, and we can barely reject the hypothesis that all are zero (final row, F
statistic is 2.76 with p–value of 0.027) or that a death has the same effect no matter what
its cause (F-statistic is 2.80 with a p–value of 0.039). In Table 8, where the country
regressions are averaged, the t–values are somewhat larger and the tests of no effects and
of equality are larger and more significant. The anomalous effects of HIV/AIDS may
have some real basis—for example, there is some evidence that some deaths, such as
deaths from cancer or other “dread diseases,” are feared more than others (Sunstein,
2004). Different causes of death will typically involve different family members of
different ages—we do not know who died in these data—but it seems likely that in most
of Africa, even now, HIV/AIDS deaths are more common among those who are
relatively well-off, which is consistent with the reduction of the positive effect when
income is introduced, albeit imperfectly given the measurement error in income. Note
also that the change in the estimates with income also comes from the change in sample

17

size; for example, the upward revision of the effect of an AIDS death on sadness in Table
8 can be replicated without income but with the regression confined to the sample for
which income is not missing.
Even if we take the largest negative coefficient, which is for the loss of a family
member to tuberculosis, the estimate in Table 8 is –0.129, compared with 0.374 for log
income, so that the income equivalent of losing an immediate family member to TB is a
change in log income of –0.129 divided by 0.374, or –0.345, equivalent to a 29 percent
reduction in income. Alternatively, the compensation for the loss would be 41 percent of
income for as many years as the effect lasts. By the same token, the compensation for a
loss to HIV/AIDS or to childbirth (at least in Table 8) is negative. These numbers seem
absurd on their own terms, even before we consider comparing those monetary values to
similar monetary values from rich countries. And they are almost certainly gross
overestimates, given attenuation bias in the estimates of income through measurement
error.
The estimated effects of mortality on the two positive emotions, smiling and
enjoyment, are qualitatively similar to the estimated effects of mortality on the ladder.
Deaths from TB and malaria inhibit smiling or laughing and inhibit enjoyment, but deaths
from HIV/AIDS or from childbirth have sometimes positive and sometimes negative
effects, depending on whether income is included. The coefficients are sufficiently far
from zero that we can reject the null of no effect from any death in most cases, but we
can usually accept the hypothesis that all deaths have the same effect on the experience of
these emotions.

18

The results for the last two measures—sadness and depression—are closely in line
with what we might expect, and at variance with the results for the ladder. People are
sharply and significantly more likely (up to five percentage points) to report feeling sad
or depressed if they have lost a family member. All four causes of death have similar
effects, and in spite of their individual and joint significance, we cannot reject the
hypothesis that the four estimates are identical. The anomalous effect of an HIV/AIDS
death on the ladder or on positive feelings—and in some cases of a death from a woman
in childbirth—does not recur for sadness or depression. A death is a death and leads to
sadness and depression. The evident coherence and sensibleness of these results contrasts
with those for the ladder, and make it much harder to attribute the latter to the effects of
poorly designed questions, lack of understanding by respondents, or general measurement
error.
If we were to choose to express the effects on sadness and depression in terms of the
effects of income, the results would be much larger than for the ladder of life. For
example, if we were to take –0.04 as a representative estimate of the effects of disease,
and 0.025 as a representative estimate of the effect of log income, the ratio is –1.6, so that
the effects of the death on sadness or depression would be reproduced by an 80 percent
reduction in income, or offset by a fivefold increase. Of course, if we were to decide to
use these numbers to calculate the monetary equivalent of the death of a family member,
we would have to explain why they are to be preferred over the much smaller (and barely
significantly different from zero) numbers that come from looking at the ladder of life,
particularly given that the ladder is much closer to the life satisfaction measures that have
been used in the previous literature.

19

Before addressing that question, it is worth considering another measure, previously
reported by Tortora (2008). The World Poll asked respondents in Africa to rank in
importance twelve objectives based on the Millennium Development Goals. The
objectives were (1) providing more jobs for youth, (2) achieving primary education for
all, (3) reducing the spread of malaria and TB, (4) improving access to safe drinking
water, (5) reducing the death rate among children under five, (6) reducing poverty, (7)
reducing the number of women dying during childbirth, (8) reducing the spread of
HIV/AIDS, (9) achieving gender equality and empowering women, (10) improving
access to sanitation facilities, (11) providing access to new technology, and (12) reducing
hunger. Each respondent was given a random selection of six of the twelve objectives,
and asked to rank them from one (most important) to six (least important).
Tortora’s Table 1 shows that reducing poverty and reducing hunger handily win this
race, with average ranks of 2.41 and 2.48 respectively. Next, but with a considerably
lower rank, comes reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS, with an average rank of 3.05,
followed by jobs for youth (3.17), reducing the death rate from children under five (3.34),
reducing deaths in childbirth (3.38), achieving primary education for all (3.62), reducing
the spread of malaria and TB (3.64), and improving access to safe drinking water (3.75).
There is then another substantial gap in the rankings before we come to improved
sanitation (4.09), gender equality (4.38), and providing access to new technology (4.65).
Kharas (2008) reports similar findings from the Afrobarometer surveys from Kenya,
Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia, where respondents
listed their top priorities as jobs, income, support for agriculture, and improvement in
infrastructure, with health, including HIV/AIDS, attracting much lower rankings.

20

These results are consistent with some, although not all, of the findings from the
SWB analysis. The high rank for reducing poverty and hunger is consistent with the
(dominant) importance of income and education as determinants of life evaluation. That
HIV/AIDS comes next, and is ranked higher than TB and malaria, in spite of the higher
prevalence of both of the latter (Tables 4 and 5) is perhaps attributable to the current
attention given to HIV/AIDS relative to the more long-established and familiar diseases.
TB and malaria are ranked well behind deaths of children and deaths of mothers in
childbirth; the former might have been captured by the World Poll question on deaths
from chronic diarrhea, but evidently were not. Note also that only some of the ranking
questions refer explicitly to mortality, and the “spread” questions presumably elicit
responses about morbidity or other consequences of the diseases. So perhaps differences
are to be expected. But the important point about all of the results is the huge importance
attached to income (poverty and hunger) relative to the importance attached to disease.

4. Discussion: value of life and subjective wellbeing
Consider first our findings on the value of life in sub-Saharan Africa, and suppose for the
moment that it is appropriate to use the life evaluation measures in this way, an issue to
which we will return. Given this, we find very small numbers. The largest estimates are
30 to 40 percent of income, and even those estimates are biased upwards by errors of
measurement in income. These compensations refer to annual income for the death of an
immediate family member in the past twelve months; we have no information on the
required compensation in subsequent years. In a comparable exercise for Britain, using
data from 1992 to 2002, Oswald and Powdthavee (2009) estimate compensation for the

21

loss of a family member to be between ₤200,000 (upper end estimate for loss of a
partner) and ₤16,000 (lower end estimate for loss of a sibling) with monetary amounts in
1996 prices. Median earnings in 1997 were approximately ₤12,500. Viscusi and Aldy
(2003) review estimates of the value of a statistical life; these are based on the now
standard methodology, dating back to Rosen’s (1988) formulation, in which a value of
life is inferred from the earnings premium that workers receive in riskier jobs. For the
US, their central estimate for the value of a statistical life is $6.8 million for a prime age
worker earning $26,000 a year, or more than 250 times annual earnings. They review
comparably-based estimates from around the world—though none from Africa—and
estimate that the international income elasticity of the value of life is 0.6 to 0.8, which
would imply that the ratio of the value of life to income will be higher in lower income
countries. The theoretical concept underlying these estimates is the value of a person’s
own life, which is arguably higher than the value of the life of a family member, but they
nevertheless provide an indication of the magnitude that is used in the literature and by
various government agencies.
There is additional, albeit less precise, evidence for a low value of life in Africa. We
have already cited the findings on policy priorities from the World Poll and the
Afrobarometer surveys. Related evidence comes from the high price elasticity of demand
in Africa for healthcare, with large negative responses to user fees or to small charges for
medicine or preventative measures (see Easterly, 2009, for a review and discussion).
These findings may reflect a lack of understanding of the benefits of western medicine, or
they may reflect a more fundamental adaptation to and acceptance of the high levels of
morbidity and mortality that have long been a feature of African history, Iliffe (1995).

22

Certainly, the World Poll’s findings on mortality rates in childbirth, or from malaria and
tuberculosis, show that HIV/AIDS is not usually the leading cause of disease compared
with other, long-standing scourges. African households have many mechanisms that
might help them deal with the consequences of losing family members. Households are
large and there is a great deal of coming and going, particularly in those economies that
depend heavily on migration which, not coincidentally, are those most heavily afflicted
by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In such places, even before this latest epidemic, it is not
unusual for people to depart for long periods, and sometimes never to return.
These arguments are all supportive of the belief that the value of life in Africa is very
low. Yet it is important to clarify exactly what this means. It does mean that Africans are
prepared to give up relatively little money in order to prolong the life of immediate
relatives, if not their own. It does not mean that African lives are worth less than
American or European lives, that international health policy should be conditioned on
that supposition, or that we can assess the level and distribution of international wellbeing
based on these low values. The belief in the relatively low worth of African lives was a
feature of imperialism, as documented by historians such as Davis (2002) and Watts
(1997), who begins his book with an 1835 statement about how little the plague meant to
the Egyptians. It is even incorporated into the UNDP’s Human Development Index
which, by adding life expectancy to the logarithm of income, values an additional year of
life expectancy in the US as worth 20 times an additional year in India and nearly 50
times an additional year in Tanzania (Ravallion, 1997). Similarly, the analysis of the
global convergence of full income by Becker, Philipson and Soares (2005) accepts
willingness to pay as relevant for international comparisons, though the convergence they

23

document would be much reduced or eliminated if African lives were valued at the low
income equivalents found here.
Even if we accept our and the other estimates of the value of life as representing
people’s own trade-offs between health and income, that does not imply that we must
attach the same social value to additional money to all people in the world. Indeed,
international agencies, by prioritizing aid to the poor, particularly in Africa, certainly
believe that money is worth more to poorer people. One way to think about this has been
developed by Fleurbaey (2005), who works in terms of money-metric utility; the
approach been applied to international comparisons by Fleurbaey and Gaulier (2007). If
each individual has a utility function υ (h, y ) , where h is a list of health conditions, and y

is income, we can define the quantity y by

υ (h*, y ) = υ (h, y )

(1)

where h * is the list of health states corresponding to perfect health. The difference
between y and y is the amount that the person would reduce income to be restored to
perfect health, and y is the money-metric utility that captures both current health and
current income. Social welfare—here international, or cosmopolitan social welfare—is
defined over the individual levels of y , and we can use this social welfare function to
calculate, not only the priority in income that should be given to the poor, but also the
social value of health interventions directed towards them. Suppose that we write W for
the social welfare function, and there is a health innovation θ , the effect of changing θ
on social welfare takes the form

∂W
∂W ⎡ ∂yi ∂h j ⎤
=∑
⎢∑
⎥
∂θ
i ∂yi ⎣
⎢ j ∂h j ∂θ ⎥⎦
24

(2)

where i indexes individuals, and j indexes the health states. The term outside the square
brackets on the right-hand side is the social value of money to individual i, which is
higher the poorer the individual is—the standard argument for foreign aid—while the
weights applied to the derivatives of the health states inside the brackets are each
individual’s own willingness to pay for health. The point of this formulation is that each
individual’s own monetary evaluation of health is respected in making social judgments,
but the overall value of the intervention depends in addition on the marginal social value
of income to each person. So it is entirely rational for international agencies to attach
great value to improving health in Africa, even if Africans themselves are prepared to
give up relatively little money to do so.
This analysis leaves unresolved a number of difficult issues. For example, giving
money to Africa would be even better than giving healthcare, and the assistance intended
for healthcare is likely to be subverted towards poverty reduction and income
enhancement by local politicians, even those who are acting in the interests of their
constituents. So the low value placed on life by Africans still poses problems for the
current refocusing of foreign aid away from support for growth towards support for
healthcare, perhaps because it is more difficult to reach people with cash, or because aid
agencies value lives differently than individuals do, or because the methods based on
self-reported wellbeing do not tell us what we want to know, an issue to which we now
turn.
The immediate issue is that we have two different measures of wellbeing, a life
evaluation measure for which the monetary compensation for a death is low, and affect
measures, for which the monetary compensation for a death is large. The ladder question

25

requests an overall evaluation of life; this, or the related question about life satisfaction, is
often loosely referred to as “happiness” and has a more plausible claim than momentary
feelings or emotions to be a comprehensive measure of individual wellbeing. Yet the
affect measures yield more plausible measures of compensation. If we are to decide
between them, or possibly rule both to be incorrect, we need a better understanding of
what these measures tell us.
The ladder is an evaluation of life as a whole, affected by momentary experiences and
feelings, but distinct from them, Kahneman and Riis (2005). One interpretation is that the
ladder is a measure of life achievement, in which material success, education, and social
standing are the key ingredients. If so, it is easy to imagine why someone who has lost a
parent, for example, could be sad and depressed, but would not necessarily downgrade
his or her sense of achievement in life, though we would hardly expect this to be true for
the death of a partner or of a child. It is even possible that a sense of dealing well with the
misfortune might lead to an improvement in life evaluation; it is possible to wake up in
the morning feeling depressed, but still believe that one’s life as a whole is going well
(Annas, 2004). If this argument is accepted, neither life evaluation nor life satisfaction
measures, informative though they may be, are useful for calculating the compensation
for emotional distress. To quote Annas, “if you rush to look for empirical measures of an
unanalyzed ‘subjective’ phenomenon, the result will be confusion and banality.” Here the
“banality” is our finding that the loss of an immediate family member makes people sad,
while the “confusion” is that this sort of unhappiness is the same thing as “happiness”
measured as life evaluation.

26

A reasonable position is one in which both life evaluation and affect are both
components of wellbeing, without having an exclusive claim either separately or
together; it is good to have a sense of achievement, and it is good not to be depressed, but
other things—such as health—matter too, even if they are not fully captured in either a
sense of achievement or in a lack of depression. Any argument for focusing on either
affect or life evaluation would also need to deal with the imperfections of each. Affect
measures are subject to adaptation, and are easily influenced by trivial features of the
situation, while life evaluations often misremember the affective content of past episodes
(Kahneman, Wakker, and Sarin, 1997). We are surely on safer ground if we take a
capability approach, through which we value health, or income, or other things, by the
opportunities for freedom that they provide (Sen, 2001). Improving health extends
capabilities, even if those capabilities are not adequately captured by self-reported
wellbeing.

Data Notes
This analysis uses data from the 2006 and 2007 waves of the Gallup World Poll in conjunction
with data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). The DHS data come from the
following country-years: Burkina Faso (2003), Cameroon (2004), Ethiopia (2005), Ghana (2003),
Guinea (2005), Kenya (2003), Malawi (2004), Mali (2001), Niger (2006), Rwanda (2005),
Senegal (2005), Tanzania (2003), Zambia (2001/2002), and Zimbabwe (2005/2006). In some
robustness checks, we also use data from Cambodia (2005), Dominican Republic (2002), Haiti
(2005), and India (2005/2006). The data from the following countries are from preliminary
releases of the data: Cambodia, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Niger, Senegal, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe.
The DHS are nationally-representative household surveys that are available from ORC Macro
(http://www.measuredhs.com). DHS surveys include a household questionnaire, a women’s
questionnaire, and a men’s questionnaire. An exception is the 2003 DHS for Tanzania (also
referred to as the HIV/AIDS Indicator Survey (AIS) and which covers only mainland Tanzania);
this survey has an individual questionnaire (administered to both men and women), rather than
separate men’s and women’s questionnaires.
In the fourteen cross-sections in our sample, the survey also includes an HIV test. The
household questionnaire and women’s questionnaire are administered to all households
responding to the survey; the men’s questionnaire and HIV test are, in some countries,
administered to only a subsample of households. Results of HIV testing can be linked to
individual survey responses, except in Mali and Zambia. However, the HIV testing component in
these countries includes some information about respondents tested, including basic demographic
characteristics. Our analysis using DHS data uses three measures of HIV. Though in a few cases
these are calculated at the national level, for the most part they are calculated within each country
for each five-year age-group, separately by sex. Five-year age-groups are as follows: 15–19, 20–
24, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39, 40–44, 45–49. In some countries, the DHS collects HIV test results
from men (but not women) ages 50–59 but for consistency across countries (as well as across
genders), we restrict the analysis to adults 15–49. HIV Prevalence is the fraction of adults
infected with HIV (among those tested), using results from the HIV testing component. HIV
Knowledge is the fraction of DHS respondents who say that they know someone who has AIDS
or has died of AIDS. This question was asked only of those who say that they have heard of
AIDS; the fraction is calculated among those who have heard of AIDS. Responses are drawn
from the women’s and men’s questionnaires; this question was not asked in Tanzania. HIV Risk
is the fraction of DHS respondents who say that they are at moderate or greater risk of getting
AIDS (including those who say that they have AIDS). This question was asked only of those who

30

say that they have heard of AIDS; the fraction is calculated among those who have heard of
AIDS. Responses are drawn from the women’s and men’s questionnaires; this question was asked
only in Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. When calculating the prevalence of HIV
infection, we weight results using DHS-provided HIV sample weights. When calculating the
fractions with HIV Knowledge and HIV Risk, we weight results using DHS-provided individual
sample weights. Data on GDP per capita are for 2005, and come from the latest round of the
International Comparison Program, World Bank (2008).

Low HIV
Men

Notes: “High HIV” countries are Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. “Low HIV” countries are
Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Niger, Rwanda, and Senegal. In the left and middle
columns, each bar represents the weighted mean in a particular age-group, separately by sex. In the right column,
each bar represents the difference, within an age-group/sex category, between high and low HIV countries (i.e.,
middle column – left column). HIV Prevalence data are drawn from the DHS. Life evaluation, enjoyment, smiling,
sadness, and depression are drawn from the Gallup World Poll. Enjoyment, sadness, and depression are indicators
for whether, on the previous day, the respondent experienced these emotions a lot of the day. Smiling is an
indicator for whether, on the previous day, the respondent smiled and laughed a lot of the day. Five year age-groups
are as follows: 15–19 (“15” in the figure), 20–24 (“20” in the figure), 25–29 (“25” in the figure), 30–34 (“30” in the
figure), 35–39 (“35” in the figure), 40–44 (“40” in the figure), and 45–49 (“45” in the figure).

Notes: In all cells, the sample is restricted to adult respondents ages 15–49 and results are weighted using provided
sample weights. HIV Prevalence, the mean of HIV Knowledge, and the mean of HIV Risk are calculated using
DHS data. Means of life evaluation, enjoyment, smiling, sadness, and depression are calculated using Gallup data.
HIV knowledge is the fraction of DHS respondents who say that they know someone who has AIDS or has died of
AIDS. HIV Risk is the fraction of DHS respondents who say that they are at moderate or higher risk of being
infected with HIV. Life evaluation is the Cantril ladder on a scale from 0 (“the worst possible life”) to 10 (“the best
possible life”). Enjoyment, sadness, and depression are indicators for whether, on the previous day, the respondent
experienced these emotions a lot of the day. Smiling is an indicator for whether, on the previous day, the respondent
smiled and laughed a lot of the day.

Notes: Fractions of respondents, weighted by sampling weights, who in the 2006 wave of the Gallup World Poll
answer positively to the question “Do you know someone who has died from X?” where the column heads show X.
The seven diseases are those listed, plus cholera, hepatitis, polio, and smallpox. The final column is an estimate of
AIDS mortality per thousand based on the estimate of AIDS deaths taken from UNAIDS (2008), divided by a
thousand times 2005 population taken from the 2007 World Development Indicators.

Notes: The average is a simple average over countries (calculated using the within country weights) without
population weighting. Each column shows the difference in means between those reporting to have lost, in the last
twelve months, an immediate family member to malaria, HIV/AIDS, TB, or childbirth and those who did not so
report. Standard errors are corrected for design effects. The FE regression in the last row comes from regressing the
dependent variable on a dummy for mortality from any cause and a set of country fixed effects, with standard errors
corrected for survey design.

Notes: Each pair of columns shows two country fixed-effect regressions with the dependent variable as column head, the first excluding the log of income, the
second including it. Education is a dummy that is 1 if the person has completed more than an elementary education. Obs is the number of observations in each
regression; note the drop when income is included. The two F-statistics are F-tests for the coefficients on the four causes of death being equal, and for all effects
being zero.

Notes: In all columns, the sample is restricted to adult respondents ages 15–49 and results are weighted using
provided sample weights. The dependent variable is the ladder on a scale from 0 (“the worst possible life”) to 10
(“the best possible life”). In column (1), the dependent variable is the country–level weighted average of the ladder.
In columns (2)–(6), the dependent variable is the individual ladder. HIV Knows is country–level HIV knowledge
among adults 15–49 in column (1) and country/sex/age-group-level knowledge in columns (2)–(6). Knowledge is
the fraction of DHS respondents who say that they know someone who has AIDS or has died of AIDS. lnGDP is
the log of country-level GDP per capita in 2005, as measured by the International Comparison Program, World
Bank (2008). lny is the log of family income, using individual responses from the Gallup survey. In columns (2)–
(6), standard errors are clustered at the country/sex/age-group-level. Absolute values of t–statistics are in
parentheses. * p < 0.05
