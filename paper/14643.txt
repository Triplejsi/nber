Globalization and Income Distribution: A Specific Factors Continuum Approach
James E. Anderson
NBER Working Paper No. 14643
January 2009, Revised August 2009
JEL No. F10
ABSTRACT
Does globalization widen inequality or increase income risk? In the specific factors continuum model
of this paper, globalization widens inequality, amplifying the positive (negative) premia for export
(import-competing) sectors. Globalization amplifies the risk from idiosyncratic relative productivity shocks
but reduces risk from aggregate shocks to absolute advantage, relative endowments and transfers.
Aggregate-shock-induced income risk bears most heavily on the poorest specific factors, while non-traded
sectors are insulated. Heterogeneous shocks to firms induce Darwinian competition for sector specific
factors that is harsher the more productive the sector. Wage bargaining implies within-sector wage
dispersion that falls or rises with export intensity depending on the joint distribution of sectoral and
firm shocks.

Globalization is often thought to have increased inequality. The model
of this paper implies that globalization raises inequality everywhere. Globalization is also commonly thought to have increased personal income risk.
Foreign productivity shocks have increased effects on traded goods sectors
while non-traded goods sectors risk the onset of trade. A contrasting economic intuition suggests that wider markets reduce the real income effects
of aggregate shocks to relative productivity, relative endowments and international transfers. Both intuitive forces are combined and formalized here
in a specific factors continuum model that isolates the key elements while
abstracting from inessential details.
For thinking about income inequality and risk, the specific factors model
has several advantages. First, random productivity draws across sectors combined with ex post immobility of ex ante identical factors readily rationalize
the tremendous heterogeneity of wages across sectors, especially the premium
for export sector employment.1 Second, when firms receive different productivity draws, a Darwinian gale blows through the sectoral factor market,
reallocating the sector specific factor to the more productive firms. When
paired with wage bargaining, the model can explain why larger and more
productive firms within each sector pay higher wages for skilled labor. Depending on the joint distribution of sectoral and firm shocks, within-sector
wage dispersion may increase or decrease with export intensity. The Darwinian force in this paper does not require fixed export costs to select firms,
in contrast to the Melitz (2003) model. This may be an advantage in light
of Besedes and Prusa’s (2006) finding that trade in highly disaggregated
sectors winks on and off frequently, appearing inconsistent with fixed trade
costs. Third, trade cost is linked to income distribution by the same mechanism as in the now-standard political economy of trade policy (Grossman
and Helpman, 1994; empirically confirmed by Goldberg and Maggi, 1999),
pointing toward a political economy of the risk-sharing aspect of trade policy.
See Eaton and Grossman (1985) for analysis of ‘optimal’ tariffs as insurance.
The model focuses on the distributional consequences of combining specificity, random productivity and globalization. After the endowment of potentially skilled labor is allocated across sectors, specific skills are acquired,
productivity shocks are realized and the skilled labor combines with intersec1
This regularity was given prominence by Katz and Summers (1989). The export
premium is well documented in the US and other developed countries. Sparser available
evidence finds the same pattern in poorer countries as well — see Milner and Tandrayen
(2006) on sub-Saharan Africa and Tsou, Liu and Huang (2006) on Taiwan.

torally mobile unskilled labor to produce output as efficiently as possible. All
sectors have identical ex ante potential production functions. In contrast to
the goods continuum Ricardian and Heckscher-Ohlin models of Dornbusch,
Fischer and Samuelson (1977, 1980), trade is diversified, action occurs on
both intensive and extensive margins, and the distributional consequences of
globalization for import-competing sectors are prominent. As with its predecessor continuum models, sharp implications are obtained that appear likely
to obtain in more general cases. The tractability of the model suggests that
it it is a good platform on which to build extensions. The Ricardian continuum model arises as the special case where the specific factor allocation is
perfectly efficient ex post, effectively becoming a mobile factor able to move
in response to realizations of shocks.
The paper first characterizes the ex post equilibrium production and trade
patterns. Comparative static results with respect to shocks in relative endowments, relative technology (absolute advantage), transfers and trade costs
are drawn and reported in the Appendix, echoing Dornbusch, Fischer and
Samuelson. Based on the comparative statics, it is shown that globalization
ordinarily reduces the magnitude of nominal and real income response to the
shocks, hence globalization reduces aggregate risk.
Skilled workers choose their sectors prior to the realization of productivity shocks. Their combined actions act in equilibrium to equalize ex ante
prospects, so that identical ex ante skilled wage distributions characterize
each sector in equilibrium. The ex post returns differ across sectors due to
differences in realized productivity shocks and the efficient allocation of the
mobile factor that ensues.
The equilibrium skilled wage distribution exhibits higher skilled wages
in export sectors (those receiving relatively high productivity realizations)
than in import competing sectors (those receiving relatively low productivity
realizations). Globalization widens income inequality in each country, raising
the top, lowering the bottom and narrowing the middle. Within sectors,
when firms have heterogeneous productivity shocks, the more productive
firms expand, driving out those less fortunate. This force is stronger in more
productive sectors. With wage bargaining, more productive firms pay higher
skilled wages. Within-sector wage dispersion can be increasing or decreasing
in export intensity, depending on the joint distribution of sectoral and firm
shocks.
Viewed ex ante, the model captures the popular sense that personal incomes are more risky in a globalizing world due to idiosyncratic productivity
2

shocks. But in contrast, the model also implies that globalization ordinarily
reduces nominal income risk due to aggregate risk. This offsetting benefit of
globalization is amplified in real income risk. The cost of living index moves
with the factoral terms of trade, providing a damping effect on real income
that is larger the higher the equilibrium proportion of traded goods in the
consumption basket.
The effect of globalization on income distribution has previously been
studied in models that miss some important empirical regularities. For example, the factor proportions model applications surveyed in Feenstra (2004)
have income distributions of low dimension, in contrast to empirical distributions with high dimensionality characterized by export premia (and importcompeting negative premia). In the Heckscher-Ohlin continuum model application of Feenstra and Hanson (1999), globalization raises the skill premium
by increasing the average skill intensity of the production mix in North and
South through reallocation on the extensive margin of production. The model
of this paper is in contrast focused on sectoral wage premia. In the general
case developed in the Appendix, globalization can raise or lower the average
skill premium in both countries depending on whether the average skill intensity of production rises or falls, itself ordinarily determined by whether the
elasticity of substitution is less or greater than one. The model in the text
sets the elasticity of substitution equal to one, neutralizing globalization’s
effect on the average skill premium.
New papers by Blanchard and Willman (2008) and Costinot and Vogel
(2008) are similar to this paper in featuring continuum income distributions
with heterogeneous workers who sort into industries of varying skill intensity.
In contrast to the present paper these models do not explain locational rents
to otherwise observationally identical factors. Moreover, they imply that
globalization widens inequality in one economy while reducing inequality in
the other economy, which is apparently counterfactual.2 Nevertheless, these
two approaches should be viewed as complements in a fuller understanding
of trade and income inequality. Also related is a new paper by Helpman,
Itskhoki and Redding (2008) that generates high dimensional income distributions due to workers’ differential abilities interacting with a costly screening technology used by heterogeneous firms to select from applicants. As in
this paper, the introduction of trade raises inequality in both countries. The

Brazilian inequality see Calmon et al. (2002).

mechanism is different, however, being run by the selection effect of fixed
export costs.
The model is also related to a literature featuring productivity shocks.
Eaton and Kortum (2002) derive the equilibrium implications of the Ricardian continuum model with sectoral productivity shocks. They solve the
many country Ricardian continuum model by imposing a Frechet distribution on the productivity shocks. The present paper derives for the first time
the specific factors model’s implications for the general equilibrium pattern
of production, trade and income distribution in a two country world with
productivity shocks. Judiciously imposing further restrictions on technology
yields a closed form characterization of equilibrium.
Section 1 presents the basic production model for given allocations of the
specific factors. Section 2 derives the global equilibrium of the two trading
countries. Section 3 deals with the comparative statics of the model. Section 4 derives the ex post distributional implications. Section 5 discusses
the equilibrium ex ante allocation of the specific factor. Section 6 analyzes
heterogeneous firms within sectors. Section 7 concludes with speculation on
extensions to empirical work and dynamics. The Appendix shows that the
results of the text hold for the general neoclassical production function.

1

The Production Model

Each good has an identical potential production function that is increasing,
homogeneous of degree one and concave in skilled and unskilled labor. Maximal potential output in sector z is reduced by the realization of a random
productivity draw 1/a(z), the total factor productivity parameter, a(z) ≥ 1.
Until Section 6, all firms within a sector receive only the common productivity
draw. The potential production function is F [L(z), K(z)], where L(z), K(z)
are the amounts of unskilled labor and skilled labor respectively allocated to
sector z.
A Cobb-Douglas potential production function is imposed at the end of
this section and the remainder of the text to generate parametric results.
The Appendix shows that the qualitative analysis holds with the general
neoclassical production function. The setup also extends to any number of
specific factor classes such as multiple skill types, each of which experiences
income dispersion like that analyzed here for one skill type.

Output in sector z is given by
y(z) =

λ(z)K
f [L(z)/λ(z)K]
a(z)

(1)

where f (·) ≡ F [L(z)/K(z), 1], λ(z) is the fraction of skilled labor allocated
to sector z where it acquires sector specific skills, and K is the total supply
of skilled labor. Prior to allocation, labor skills are potential. The skillacquisition phase is suppressed for simplicity.
After the skilled labor is allocated (a decision modeled in Section 5) and
skills are acquired, productivity shocks are realized and unskilled labor is
allocated. For simplicity, the range of productivity shocks is restricted such
that skilled workers never choose to become mobile unskilled workers. This
implies that even the sector with the worst shock continues to produce.3
Equilibrium allocation of unskilled labor satisfies the value of marginal
product conditions for each sector:
w=

p(z) 0
f [L(z)/λ(z)K],
a(z)

(2)

where w is the unskilled wage rate and p(z) is the price of good z. It is
convenient in what follows to work with efficiency prices P (z) ≡ p(z)/a(z).
Solving for the unskilled labor demand yields L(z) = λ(z)Kh(P (z)/w); h0 =
−1/f 00 > 0. Substituting into the production function, the supply function
is given by
λ(z)K
f [h(P (z)/w)].

A country produces all goods for which it has a positive specific endowment
under the Cobb-Douglas assumption because the mobile factor has a very
large marginal product in any sector where its level of employment is very
small.

As allocation of the specific capital grows more efficient, the model converges onto
a Ricardian model (since production functions are identical over z). Then in the limit
g = L maxz p(z)/a(z).
5
The identical Cobb-Douglas assumption is consistent with the well known empirical
regularity of constant labor shares of GDP, despite shifting production shares.
6
The elasticity of transformation is equal to α/(1 − α).

Global Equilibrium

There is a foreign economy with identical potential production functions in
each sector, but differing productivity draws a∗ (z) from a different productivity distribution. The foreign economy is also characterized by differing
specific factor endowments K ∗ (z) and labor endowment L∗ .
The foreign economy has GDP function and GDP share equations generated analogously to the home economy, all foreign variables being denoted
by *’s. The foreign efficiency prices are denoted P ∗ (z). In the Cobb-Douglas
case the foreign GDP function is g ∗ = (L∗ )α (K ∗ )1−α G∗ where
Z 1
∗
G =[
λ∗ (z)(P ∗ (z))1/(1−α) ]1−α .
0

A crucial concept is the relative advantage of the home country A(z) ≡
a∗ (z)/a(z). For any good z, A(z) gives the absolute advantage of home producers. It will be convenient below to think of a shift in the entire A(z) schedule as a shift in absolute advantage. Define Λ(z) ≡ A(z)1/(1−α) λ(z)/λ∗ (z),
home relative labor productivity in z. It is in principle possible that Λ(z)
could have a different ordering from A(z), but Section 5 shows that the
equilibrium allocation of skilled labor implies λ(z) = λ∗ (z) = γ(z), hence
Λ(z) = A(z)1/(1−α) has the same ordering as A(z). The slope of Λ(z) gives
the comparative advantage ranking of sectors, with low z associated with
high home relative efficiency.
Trade is costly, with parametric markup factor t > 1. For goods exported
by the home country, p∗ (z) = p(z)t. For goods exported by the foreign
country, p(z) = p∗ (z)t. In terms of efficiency prices, P ∗ (z) = P (z)t/A(z) for
home exports while P ∗ (z) = P (z)/tA(z) for home imports.
Tastes are identical across countries and characterized by a Cobb-Douglas
utility function with parametric expenditure ‘share’ for good z given by γ(z).
The cumulative
expenditure share on goods indexed in the interval [0, z] is
Rz
given by 0 γ(x)dx = Γ(z).
International trade occurs in equilibrium for a range of goods where relative productivity differences are large enough to cover the trade cost. Home
exports are in the interval z ∈ [0, z̄) and foreign exports in the interval
z ∈ (z̄ ∗ , 1]. Non-traded goods are in the interval [z̄, z̄ ∗ ] where productivity
differences are too small to overcome trade costs. The export cutoff points
z̄, z̄ ∗ are endogenous.
7

Equilibrium prices must clear markets for each good. Due to the CobbDouglas preferences and the iceberg trade costs, s(z)g + s∗ (z)g ∗ = γ(z)(g +
g ∗ ).7 This implies for traded goods:
s(z) g
s∗ (z) g ∗
+
= 1.
γ(z) g + g ∗
γ(z) g + g ∗

(11)

For non-traded goods s(z) = γ(z) = s∗ (z); z ∈ [z̄, z̄ ∗ ]. For traded goods, (11)
implies that s < γ ⇐⇒ s∗ > γ.

2.1

Goods Market Equilibrium

In the Cobb-Douglas case, it is convenient to choose the foreign GDP deflator
as the numeraire, and interpret G, the home GDP deflator, as the multifactoral terms of trade.8 The specification yields closed form solutions for goods
prices given G. Then in the next sub-section, the balanced trade condition
is solved for the equilibrium multifactoral terms of trade G.
Using (10) and (8) in (11), the equilibrium transform of the efficiency
unit price for traded goods is given by
P (z)1/(1−α) =

The text expression for market clearance is built up from material balance using
iceberg melting trade costs. For example, in the range z ∈ [0, z̄], market clearance is given
by
y(z) − x(z) = t[x∗ (z) − y ∗ (z)]
where x(z), x∗ (z) denote consumption of good z in the home and foreign countries. The
equation implies that for each unit imported by the foreign economy, t > 1 units must be
shipped from the home economy, t − 1 units melting away en route. Multiply both sides
by p(z), use p∗ (z) = p(z)t and utilize the GDP and expenditure share definitions to obtain
the text expression.

The Cobb-Douglas production function restriction is useful in getting sharp results
that the Appendix shows extend more generally. In the general case, G is replaced by the
home relative wage.

Crucially, export intensity s(z)/γ(z) is decreasing in z for traded goods. For
non-traded goods, s(z) = γ(z) = s∗ (z), z ∈ [z̄, z̄ ∗ ].9
The margins of non-tradability are determined by s(z̄) = γ(z̄) and s∗ (z̄ ∗ ) =
γ(z̄ ∗ ). These solve for the trade cutoff equations

Solve for G as an implicit function of z: G = B(z, ·) using z ∗ = Z ∗ (z, t)

at the maximum of ln B(z; ·) determines the equilibrium z̄, ln G. The intersection of (19) with the tangent line at E gives z̄ ∗ .
Proposition 1 Provided trade costs are not too high, a unique trading
equilibrium exists on z ∈ [0, 1].
If equilibrium exists, it is unique because the properties of (21) imply that
ln B(z) has a unique maximum due to Λ(z) decreasing in z. The equilibrium
allocates home and foreign unskilled labor to maximize world income in terms
of the numeraire, an instance of the invisible hand.

interval. If Λ(z) is too large relative to a given t, both the downward sloping
schedules in Figure 1 are shifted upward and there is no trade because the
foreign disadvantage is too large to overcome the trade cost.12 Nonexistence
also arises when country sizes are sufficiently unequal for given trade cost and
Λ(z). Drawing on a result proved in the next section, a rise (fall) in R/R∗
shifts ln B(z) down (up), and the range of exports of the foreign (home)
country can vanish. Equilibrium G is unable to fall (rise) enough to permit
trade.
When the equilibrium allocation of skilled labor λ(z) = γ(z) = λ∗ (z) obtains, Λ(z) =
A(z)1/(1−α) , hence (1 − α) ln Λ(z) = ln A(z).

It is instructive to note the points of difference with the familiar Ricardian
continuum model that is nested in the specific factors model of this pa12

per. The Ricardian (and Heckscher-Ohlin continuum) model(s) shut down
import-competing production whereas the specific factors model ordinarily
has diversified production. When ex post reallocation of skilled labor occurs,
both types of labor are used in the same proportions in every sector that
produces and low productivity sectors shut down. (1 − α) ln Λ(z) is replaced
by ln A(z) in Figure 1, ln G is replaced by w, the home relative wage, and the
balanced trade equilibrium condition (21) that implies ln B(z) is replaced by
ln w = ln Γ∗ (z)R/Γ(z)R∗ . The Ricardian balanced trade equilibrium condition is upward sloping in z throughout, in contrast to the ln B(z) function
that reaches a maximum at z̄.13 The Ricardian model also emerges as a special case of the Cobb-Douglas model when α = 1. The endowments model is
the opposite extreme where α = 0.

Aggregate Shocks, Real Incomes Risks and
Globalization

The comparative static responses of the terms of trade and the extensive
margins to shocks in relative factor endowments, absolute advantage, transfers and trade costs resemble those from Dornbusch, Fischer and Samuelson
(1977). The details are in the Appendix. New results shows that globalization — a fall in trade costs — ordinarily reduces the variance of the factoral
terms of trade, hence aggregate income risk, due to these aggregate shocks.
Supply side shocks to national incomes are driven by shocks in relative
country size due to differential growth rates, and relative productivity (absolute advantage) shifts while demand side shocks come from transfers (e.g.
international capital flows). For transfers, globalization has a first order effect in damping the shock in β delivered to the terms of trade because βBβ /B
is proportional to 1 − Γ − Γ∗ , the proportion of non-traded goods. For infinitesimal supply side shocks there is no first order effect. But for discrete
changes in all cases:
Proposition 2 Globalization ordinarily reduces the variance in G induced
by shocks in relative endowments, absolute advantage and transfers.
The variance reduction arises because a fall in trade costs flattens the
ln B(z) function by reducing Bz . A smaller slope implies that for every re13

B(z) need not be globally concave, but the portions to the left and right of Bz = 0
must be upward and downward sloping respectively.

13

alization of the shock, the impact on ln G is less in absolute value. The
qualification “ordinarily” arises because the change in trade costs has ambiguous second order impacts on the exogenous shifts in the ln B(z) function
and on Bz .14
The rationale is simple — lower trade costs increase the responsiveness
of the extensive margin to aggregate shocks, hence changes in the extensive
margin absorb more of the impact leaving less to fall on the factoral terms
of trade. How large these variance dampening effects are will depend on
hard-to-specify details such as the distributions of γ’s and Λ’s.
The aggregate-risk-damping property of globalization should obtain more
generally than in the present model. The same mechanism is at work in the
Ricardian model.15 The Appendix shows that the same qualitative results
obtain with the general neoclassical production function: lower trade costs
increase the responsiveness of the extensive margin to aggregate shocks and
thus damp down factoral terms of trade responses, all else equal.
Statements about nominal income changes in the model carry through
to statements about real income changes, hence the remainder of the paper
focuses on nominal incomes. The demonstration focuses on aggregate real
income because personal real incomes are shares of aggregate income, with
details analyzed in Section 4.

The trade balance equation in the Ricardian case implies w/w∗ = Γ(z̄)L∗ /Γ∗ (z̄ ∗ )L

factors case. In both cases the responsiveness to shocks on the extensive margin is driven
by Zz∗ , a response that is damped by higher trade costs.

Thus real and nominal incomes move together as the factoral terms of trade
change.
As for other sources of change in the cost of living index, changes in the
extensive margin have no local first order
R 1 effect. Technology shocks that
alter a(z) affect real income through − 0 γ(z)d ln a(z). Trade cost shocks
(i.e. distribution technology shocks) affect ln C ambiguously at constant G: a
fall in t lowers buyer import prices but raises buyer export prices. Trade cost
changes thus induce terms of trade effects that have the standard ambiguous
impact on real income.
As for the variance of real income,
Proposition 3 Globalization unambiguously reduces the real income risk
due to factoral terms of trade risk.
Globalization increases the range of traded goods. This makes the cost of
living index more responsive to the factoral terms of trade and thus makes
real income less responsive to the factoral terms of trade. Formally, globalization lowers the right hand side of (22):

Proposition 3 in combination with Proposition 2 make a good case that
globalization reduces the real income risk due to aggregate shocks. This observation is related to that of Newbery and Stiglitz (1984), who note that
terms of trade responses to shocks tend to offset the direct impact of the
shock and thus provide a kind of insurance. In terms of the model, globalization improves the coverage of this insurance. (In contrast to Newbery
and Stiglitz, the presence or absence of risk-sharing assets has no impact
on resource allocation here, so there is no impact of globalization that can
reduce the efficiency of trade.)17 Cole and Obstfeld (1991) note that this
partial insurance feature of terms of trade responses implies smaller scope
for international asset trade to provide gains from risk-sharing.

Income Distribution

The average skill premium in the Cobb-Douglas case is independent of international forces; the unitary elasticity of substitution conveniently neutralizes
Stolper-Samuelson distributional effects of globalization.18 The model implies that the unskilled wage is
w = gL = α(K/L)1−α G.
The average return to skilled labor (the value of marginal product of an
equiproportionate increase in all specific factors) is given by
gK = (1 − α)(L/K)α G.
The skill premium is
1−α L
,
α K
independent of international forces. More general neoclassical production
functions in the specific factors setting imply that the average skill premium
may rise or fall in both countries due to globalization,19 depending on whether
gK /gL =

17

I am grateful to Jonathan Vogel for pointing out this link.
In the 2x2 factor proportions model, globalization causes the skill premium to rise
in the skill abundant country and fall in the skill scarce country. In the Heckscher-Ohlin
continuum model, globalization causes the average skill intensity of production to rise in
both countries, driving up the skill premium.
19
Linkage between openness and capital accumulation or technology will also violate the
invariance property.

the average skill intensity of production rises or falls. The Appendix develops the details and argues that with CES production functions the average
skill premium ordinarily rises (falls) as the elasticity of substitution is less
(greater) than one. Empirical estimates suggest that the elasticity of substitution exceeds 1, so the strong evidence for globally rising skill premia is
inconsistent with globalization in the model unless skill-biased technological change is also at work. Skill-biased technological change raises the skill
premium, all else equal, represented in the Cobb-Douglas case by a fall in α.
The distribution of equilibrium skilled wages across sectors and its comparative statics depend partly on the allocation of the potentially specific
factors to sectors. The possible distributions are restricted by imposing the
equilibrium skill allocation derived in Section 5, which equates the allocation
of skilled workers λ(z) to the allocation of expenditures γ(z). Under this
allocation the pattern of positive (negative) premia for export (import competing) sectors emerges. Moreover, the distribution of premia are ordered by
export intensity s(z)/γ(z). Intuitively this is because the highest comparative advantage sectors would have the largest premia even in the absence of
a mobile factor, but their premia are increased by their ability to draw more
of the mobile factor to their favored sector.
The analysis of distribution here focuses exclusively on the home country
because the specific factor income distribution in the foreign country is the
mirror image of the home distribution. In each sector, the specific return
is residually determined as r(z)λ(z)K = [1 − α(z)]p(z)y(z) where α(z) =
wL(z)/p(z)y(z). Relative to the average return,

(24)-(26) show that export sectors tend on average to have higher returns

sectors. The implication emerges cleanly with the ex ante equilibrium allocation of skilled labor λ(z) = γ(z) = λ∗ (z) ⇒ γ(z)/λ(z) = 1, ∀z. In this
case Λ(z) = a∗ (z)/a(z), the home absolute advantage in good z. Figure 2
illustrates the implications, formalized in words as:
Proposition 4 With the equilibrium (efficient) allocation of skilled labor,
the skilled wage is falling in z for traded goods and equals the average skilled
wage for non-traded goods.
Since export intensity s(z)/γ(z) is decreasing in z, Proposition 4 implies
that skill premia rise with export intensity.
The comparative static implications of the model for income distribution
can now be drawn. Consider first the effect of improvements in the factoral
terms of trade G. For example, two underlying drivers of such improvements
are foreign relative growth and a transfer into the home country. r(z) varies
directly with s(z). Examining (16) and (17), s(z) is decreasing in G for both
exports and imports while for non-traded goods s(z) is independent of G.
Increases in the factoral terms of trade G thus redistribute specific factor
income from traded goods to non-traded goods. As for redistribution within
the traded sectors, it is convenient to focus first on returns relative to the
mean (equal to the non-traded skilled wage), r(z)/gK = s(z)/λ(z).
Proposition 5 The relative returns of trade-exposed specific factors fall
with G everywhere, and most for the least productive sectors.

and H 0 > 0. The export cutoff equations are used above to simplify the
derivatives of (16) and (17). The implications are illustrated in Figure 2.
The intuition is that the skilled wage relative to the mean is given by
s(z)/gK and the responsiveness of supply shares to changes in the factoral
terms of trade is biggest for the lowest share sectors because the general equilibrium supply elasticity is given by Gpp p/G = [1−s(z)]α/(1−α). Proposition
5 and its intuition extend from the Cobb-Douglas to the general neoclassical
case, as the Appendix argues, but with mild qualification.
Figure 2 illustrates the effect of a rise in G and a fall in t (analyzed below)
on the distribution of r for efficient skilled labor allocation λ(z) = γ(z) =
λ∗ (z). A log-linear form for A(z) is imposed for simplicity. A 1 percent rise in
G lowers the ln r(z)/gK schedules for traded goods by −1/[(1 − α)(GR/R∗ +
1)]. A 1 percent fall in t raises export relative incomes by the (absolute value
18

of the) expression on the right hand side of (4) and lowers import sector
relative incomes by the expression on the right hand side of (4). The figure is
drawn assuming that G < t so that a one percent fall in t has a bigger impact
than a one percent rise in G for import competing sectors, but this ranking is
arbitrary and without significance for the analysis. The complication of nonuniform γ(z)/λ(z) does not affect the elasticities of returns with respect to
G, but it alters the one-to-one relationship between r(z) and s(z) imposed in
Figure 2. The distribution profile in Figure 2 can be thought of as indicating
central tendency, with a confidence interval enclosing it.

When aggregate risk is present, the ex post distribution in Figure 2 is
shifted up or down and the cutoffs z̄ and z̄ ∗ shift back and forth depending
on the realization of aggregate shocks to absolute advantage, country size or
transfers, but the profile retains its shape.
Globalization is modeled as decreases in symmetric trade costs. On the
extensive margin, globalization widens inequality as it narrows the range of
20

non-traded goods [z̄, z̄ ∗ ] that is sheltered from external competition. Thus
globalization redistributes specific factor income to exports from both nontraded goods and imported goods and to non-traded goods from imported
goods for any given factoral terms of trade G.
The effect of a change in t on the distribution of specific factor income
relative to the mean is given by

For non-traded goods, sector specific factor incomes are invariant to t. For
exported goods, a fall in t increases relative income by more the more productive the sector, while for imported goods the relative income is reduced
by more the less productive the sector. The results are illustrated in Figure
2. Thus
Proposition 6 Globalization at given factoral terms of trade reduces the
specific factor income of import-competing sectors by more the less relatively
productive the sector, increases the specific factor income of exporting sectors by more the more productive the sector, while non-traded sectors are
completely insulated from globalization.
Notice that inequality increases in both countries, and that this property
does not require restricting the distributions of productivity draws. It is a
feature of factor specificity and the assumed equilibrium allocation of factors.
The effect of globalization on the factoral terms of trade is ambiguous, but
any improvement due to the fall in trade costs will redistribute income to
non-traded sector specific factors from traded sector specific factors.
Proposition 2 showed that globalization reduces the variance of the factoral terms of trade due to aggregate shocks, thus tending to offset the
globalization-induced increase in exposure to idiosyncratic risk. Both forces
hit the poorest skilled workers the hardest. The size of the reduction in exposure to aggregate income income risk varies by sector in proportion to the
square of
∂ln r(z)/gK
.
∂ln G
21

With the efficient allocation, Proposition 6, illustrated by Figure 2, shows
that this offset in aggregate risk is most important for the poorest factors,
least important for the richest factors and irrelevant for the middle nontraded sector factors. Proposition 5, also illustrated by Figure 2, shows
that globalization increases idiosyncratic risk and is likewise most important
for the poorest factors ex post, least important for the richest factors and
irrelevant for the middle income non-traded sector specific factors.

Equilibrium Skill Allocation

The rational expectations equilibrium allocation of skilled labor for the home
and foreign economies is λ(z) = γ(z) = λ∗ (z). This follows because the
production functions in all sectors are ex ante identical, and the only source
of predictable difference across sectors is variation in γ(z). The two countries
differ in their relative endowments L/K and L∗ /K ∗ , but this provides no
useful information for the sectoral allocation problem facing skilled workers.
The relative return is given by (24)-(26). When λ(z) = γ(z) = λ∗ (z),
the price prospects for every sector are identical ex ante. Then this is an
equilibrium allocation because no agent has an incentive to deviate in his
allocation. Any other allocation induces price variation that can be anticipated and arbitraged. Thus the equilibrium is unique. The point is simplest
to see for non-traded goods. Away from the allocation λ(z) = γ(z) = λ∗ (z),
the home non-traded goods market clears ex post with
1/(1−α)

γ(z)
P (z)
.
=
G
λ(z)
Consider a pair of sectors z 0 , z 00 with γ(z 0 )/λ(z 0 ) > 1 > γ(z 00 )/λ(z 00 ). Some
agents can reallocate from z 00 to z 0 and reap a certain gain in every realization
of the random productivity draws that relocate the two sectors somewhere
on [z̄, z̄ ∗ . Thus if γ(z 0 )/λ(z 0 ) 6= 1 for any 0 , non-traded sectors do not present
the same prospects and the allocation is not an equilibrium.
A more complex version of the same reasoning applies to the sectors that
end up as tradable. λ(z 0 )/γ(z 0 ) 6= 1 complicates the left hand sides of the
market clearing equations with ratios λ(z)/γ(z) and λ∗ (z)/γ(z) that multiply
the expressions for s(z)/γ(z) and s∗ (z)/γ(z). If home workers anticipate
‘structurally rational’ foreign allocations such that λ∗ (z 0 ) = γ(z 0 ), then there
are arbitrage gains unless λ(z 0 ) = γ(z 0 ), ∀z 0 . Symmetrically, if foreign skilled
22

workers anticipate home allocations λ(z) = γ(z), then there is arbitrageable
variation in P (z)/A(z) unless λ∗ (z) = γ(z). Thus the only allocation where
such arbitrage is not possible is λ(z) = γ(z) = λ∗ (z).20
Notice that no assumption is made about agents’ attitudes toward risk.
Thus the setup is compatible with concerns about distribution amplified by
declining marginal utility of income.

Heterogeneous Firms and Selection

Recent empirical research emphasizes that exporting firms are more productive, larger and pay higher wages for the same work. Including firm specific
shocks can explain these patterns, and can explain within-sector wage dispersion that decreases or increases with export intensity. Idiosyncratic productivity draws combine a firm-specific component with the sector-specific
component of previous sections. In each sector, firms compete for the specific
factor, driving the least productive from the market. Productivity differences
between export and import-competing industries are amplified because the
severity of Darwinian selection rises with average productivity.
An influential alternative model of firm selection due to fixed export costs
is Melitz (2003). The fixed unskilled labor cost of exports for each firm is
combined with a variable iceberg cost of trade t. A fall in t causes upward
pressure on wages throughout the economy because more unskilled labor is
devoted to entering exporting. The wage increase causes low productivity
firms to exit, raising average productivity. Thus globalization increases the
severity of Darwinian competition.
Comparing the two models, trade does not cause average productivity
changes in the specific factors model, but export intensity is correlated with
winnowing intensity. Selection due to fixed export costs potentially complements the specific factors mechanism and can explain the important observation that only some firms export in each sector. Fixed export costs in
the specific factors model might naturally be specified either as a lump of
sectoral skilled labor, or a lump of output (generalized iceberg costs). A full
development is beyond the scope of this paper.
The constant returns to scale assumption means that each skilled worker
can be treated as a ‘firm’ when making an ex ante location choice. In each
20

Multiple equilibria may be possible when expectations about foreign allocations do
not settle down to ‘structural rational expectations’ as assumed here.

23

sector, the better firms subsequently compete for the pool of specific skilled
labor available from the weaker firms. To preserve some heterogeneity of
firms within sectors in equilibrium, assume (realistically) that skilled worker
movement is costly. Formalizing the cost simply, one unit of original skilled
labor becomes φ < 1 units of usable skilled labor in the hiring firms. Provided
that φ is not too small, this process drives the lowest productivity firms out
of business.21
Assume initially that the (inverse) productivity draw of a firm is the sum
of a sectoral component and an idiosyncratic component: a(z, h) = a(z)+b(h)
for firm h in sector z, both independently drawn. Suppose that the firm
productivity draws are ordered such that bh > 0. In any sector z, the ex
post value of marginal product of the specific factor is thus decreasing in h.
In equilibrium, the least productive surviving firm, located at hmax , can pay
enough to offset the value of marginal product of the specific skilled labor
transferred to the most productive firm b(0). This implies
φ = [a(z) + b(hmax )]/[a(z) + b(0)].

(27)

All draws of productivity b(h) ≥ b(hmax ) result in the skilled labor moving
to the top firm with draw b(0). This results in an average productivity of
surviving firms equal to
ā(z) = a(z) + D(hmax )b(0) + [1 − D(hmax )]E[b|h ≤ hmax ],
where D is the probability of an idiosyncratic draw with worse productivity
than the marginal firm.
To sort out the implications for endogenous productivity and trade, sharp
results emerge under a plausible additional ordering condition az > 0. az >
0 is consistent with the general equilibrium ordering convention Az < 0
under the overly strong condition a∗z ≥ 0, productivity shocks are perfectly
positively correlated internationally.22 Under az > 0, differentiating (27)
21

More realistic reallocations from a set of low productivity to a set of high productivity
firms occur when there are diminishing returns to the transfer due either to a fixed managerial input for the firm or convex adjustment costs. Alternatively, more firms expand
if there are heterogeneous adjustment costs (φ’s) not perfectly negatively correlated with
productivity.
22
The comparative advantage schedule becomes A(z) = ā∗ (z)/ā(z) when sectoral productivity becomes endogenous. Āz < 0 ⇒ āz /ā > ā∗z /ā∗ by the equilibrium ordering
convention.

24

yields

(1 − φ) < 0, ∀z.
bh
Then the endogenous productivity effect is most powerful in the most productive sectors. The lower tail of firms is truncated more in export sectors
than in non-traded or import competing ones. Selection effect in this model
operates independently of trade costs.
Turning to the distributional implications, the endogenous productivity
effect amplifies the sectoral dispersion of productivity and therefore amplifies
the dispersion of ex post factor incomes. While plausible, the result is sensitive to specification. If the productivity penalty is multiplicative, a(z)b(h),
then hmax is implicitly defined by b(hmax ) = φb(0), invariant to z.
A further twist on the model explains the well documented within-sector
link between productivity, firm size and wages. The highest productivity
firms in each sector earn quasi-rents relative to the lowest productivity firm
that remains in business. Suppose that the firms are subject to wage bargaining such that the rents23 are shared with the skilled workers of each
firm. Then the highest productivity (and biggest) firms will pay the highest
skilled wages within each sector. The dispersion of within sector wages will
be least in the highest productivity sectors because the stronger Darwinian
force compresses the productivity distribution of the surviving firms. Formalizing these points, the zero profit condition for the least productive firm
in sector z implies that it can pay skilled workers

The more productive firms share their profits with the skilled workers according to

The higher is rmin (z), smaller is the within-sector dispersion of skilled wages.
Other patterns relating within-sector skilled wage dispersion to export intensity can be generated from other joint distributions of productivity draws
a(z, h). Wage dispersion independent of export intensity is associated with
a(z, h) = a(z)b(h). Wage dispersion that increases with export intensity can

be produced if high sectoral productivity coincides with bigger clusters of
high productivity firms. Such patterns are usually rationalized by knowledge transmission externalities. Formally the left-skewness of the inverse
productivity draws of firms conditional on z decreases with z. This pattern
creates space for the productivity distribution of surviving firms to have more
dispersion the higher the average productivity. Verhoogen (2008) reports evidence of such a pattern in Mexico, explaining it with a quality differentiation
mechanism.

Conclusion

The combination of specific factors and productivity shocks explains the
export earnings premium observed in many economies. Globalization necessarily increases the ex post dispersion of factor incomes in this setting.
Viewed ex ante, idiosyncratic productivity shocks make specific factor incomes more risky. In contrast, globalization damps the income risk from
aggregate shocks. Globalization reduces incomes of the poorest specific factors the most, but also reduces their income risk from aggregate shocks the
most.
The complementary work of Blanchard and Willman (2008) and Costinot
and Vogel (2008) on income distribution based on worker heterogeneity suggests that a combination of ex ante heterogeneity and ex post locational
premia can go far toward fitting the extremely rich empirical regularities of
actual income distributions. Matching frictions are a promising way to dig
more deeply into the structure of random productivities. The analytic simplicity of their models and the specific factors continuum model suggests that
analytic solutions may be feasible.
The static analysis of this paper is a platform for interesting dynamics.
The specificity of factors is transitory. Adjustment to a longer run equilibrium will have interesting and important economic drivers. An earlier
literature (for example, Neary, 1978) provides an analysis of adjustment to
a one time shock. In the present setup it is natural to think of productivity
draws arriving each period. Serial correlation in the draws would induce persistence in comparative advantage with potentially interesting implications
for investment patterns and income distribution. Labor market evidence reveals that young workers are more likely to relocate in response to locational
rents, suggesting overlapping generations models.

Appendix: Supporting Results

The supporting results are in two sub-sections. First, the comparative statics in the background of Section 3 are derived. Second is a demonstration
that the income distribution results hold for a general neoclassical production function identical across sectors. Differing production functions across
sectors brings in Heckscher-Ohlin influences on distribution but also all the
complexities of behavior towards risk and the availability and type of risksharing.

Comparative Statics
Relative Growth Shocks

Relative endowment growth induces a rise in the growing country’s export
share of GDP, its world GDP share and a less than unit elastic fall in its
factoral terms of trade.
Non-neutral growth changes R/R∗ .The effect on ln B is given by

(R/R∗ )SR/R

The reason is plain: G and R/R∗ enter (21) multiplicatively. When R/R∗
rises discretely, the change in z̄ has an impact on ln G, hence:
d ln G
(1 − α)Λz /Λ
=−
∈ (−1, 0)
∗
d ln R/R
(1 − α)Λz /Λ − Bz /B
since at the lower value of ln G and initial value of z̄, Bz /B is positive. Thus
for discrete changes, GR/R∗ increases with R/R∗ in equilibrium.
9.1.2

Absolute Advantage Shocks

Aggregate relative productivity (absolute advantage) risk is introduced as a
shift variable µ multiplying Λ(z). µ is the ratio of a domestic productivity
advance  to a foreign productivity advance ∗ : µ = /∗ . Thus a(z, ) =
ā(z)/ and a∗ (z, ∗ ) = ā∗ (z)/∗ .

29

In terms of Figure 1, ln Λ(z) is shifted by ln µ, hence both the cutoff
schedules shift in the same direction. As for B(·):24

Transfers

Transfers alter the balance of payments equilibrium condition (21) to
[Γ(z̄) + Γ∗ (z̄ ∗ )] − [1 − Γ(z̄) − Γ∗ (z̄ ∗ )]β = S X (z̄, ·) + S M (z̄ ∗ , ·)
where β = b/g is the ratio of the transfer to income and b is the international
transfer in home prices.25 A rise in β due to borrowing shifts up the ln B
function in Figure 1. In the neighborhood of equilibrium z̄:

The balance of payments constraint is given by b = Γ(b + g) − S M g − [S X g − Γ∗ (g + b)].
This solves for the text expression.

Higher trade costs raise 1 − Γ − Γ∗ and thus increase the response of the
factoral terms of trade to given transfers.
For discrete changes there is also an effect of transfers on the trade cutoff
equations (1 + β)γ(z̄) = s(z̄) and (1 + β)γ(z̄ ∗ ) = s(z̄ ∗ ). There is no longer
a closed form solution for ln G. The implicit solution is ln G = Z̄(z, β, ·)
and β Z̄β = −(1 − α)[βGR/R∗ /[1 + (1 + β)GR/ R∗ − β/(1 + β)] < (>)0 as

Fall in Trade Costs

A one percent fall in symmetric trade costs shifts the export cutoff schedule

schedule up by one unit. As for ln B,

Since −tStX /S X < tStM /S M and S X > S M ordinarily, Bt can have either
sign. As a benchmark case Bt = 0, a fall in t simply shifts ln B to the right
along with the cutoff schedule. z̄ rises and z̄ ∗ falls while ln G stays constant.

9.2

General Production Function Case

Replace the Cobb-Douglas production function with the general neoclassical
degree one homogeneous and concave, twice differentiable potential production function F (K(z), L(z)).
Let the foreign wage be the numeraire. Multiply and divide by the home
wage rate in (6) to obtain prices in terms of home labor units Pe(z) = P (z)/w.
31

Then home GDP is given by wg({Pe(z)}, ·). The GDP shares are given by
(6) after dividing through by the unskilled wage w:
λ(z)Pe(z)f [h(Pe(z))]
.
s(z) = R 1
λ(z)Pe(z)f [h(Pe(z))]dz
0
The arbitrage conditions imply Pe(z)t/wA(z) = P ∗ (z), z ∈ [0, z̄) and
Pe(z)/wA(z)t = P ∗ (z), z ∈ (z̄ ∗ , 1].26 Finally, impose the equilibrium allocation λ(z) = γ(z) = λ∗ (z).
For given w, (11) determines the traded goods prices. Imposing the ex
post ordering of sectors such that A0 < 0, (11) yields the implication that
equilibrium Pe(z) is falling in z and Pe(z)/A(z) is rising in z, hence by properties of (6) home shares are falling and foreign shares are rising in z. For
nontraded goods s(z) = γ(z) determines home prices Pe(z) and s∗ (z) = γ(z)
determines foreign prices P ∗ (z). Finally, the entire schedule of equilibrium
Pe(z) is increasing in w with elasticity less than one.
The factoral terms of trade w is determined by the trade balance equation. The shares are implicit functions of the factoral terms of trade and
the exogenous shift variables along with A(z). The analog to B(z) is the
solution for the wage w = ω(z, ·) from the balance of trade constraint
S X (w, z; ·) + S M (w, z, ·) − Γ(z̄) + Γ∗ (z̄ ∗ ) = 0. As with Figure 1, the export
cutoff equation w = A(z)/t must slice through ω(z, ·) at a maximum.
The forces that shape the comparative static derivatives such as ωβ are
different and more complex than in the Cobb-Douglas case. But the the property that globalization enhances the responsiveness of the extensive margin
of trade and thereby reduces the variance of income due to aggregate shocks
carries through. The comparative static derivative with respect to exogenous
variable x is solved from differentiating the trade balance and export cutoff
equations

The solution is
d ln w
∂ ln ω
Az /A

d ln x
∂ ln x Az /A − ∂ ln ω/∂z
26

Division by w is needed to convert prices to foreign efficiency units from home labor
efficiency units.

32

The relevant coefficient for discrete changes is the second fraction on the right
hand side. Compared to its counterpart in the Cobb-Douglas case, efficient
allocation implies (1 − α)Λz /Λ is replaced by Az /A and Bz /B is replaced by
∂ ln ω/∂z. The latter has exactly the same structure as in the Cobb-Douglas
case. Recalling the Cobb-Douglas case, differentiating Bz /B with respect to
t:

The first term is negative while the second term is ambiguous in sign for
the same reason Bt is ambiguous in sign. Disregarding the influence of the
second term, Bzt < 0. The general case replaces B with ω and G with w, all
other elements of the expression remaining the same qualitatively.
9.2.1

Income Distribution

The average skilled wage
R 1 is related to the factoral terms of trade by r̄ =
w(1 − ᾱ)/ᾱ where ᾱ ≡ 0 s(z)α(z)dz is the average unskilled labor share in
the economy. At a constant unskilled labor share, the average skilled wage
is unit elastic with respect to the factoral terms of trade. Aggregate shocks
will ordinarily change the average unskilled share, and general analytic results
are precluded. More analysis follows below at the end of this section in the
context of evaluating the effect of globalization on the average skill premium.
Nominal income and real income move together in the general case, as
in
R 1 the Cobb-Douglas case. The log of the true cost of living index is ln C =
γ(z)[ln Pe(z)+ln a(z)]dz +ln w. The cost of living index has elasticity with
0
respect to the factoral terms of trade equal to
Z 1

because Pe(z) has elasticity with respect to w between 0 and 1. The real
unskilled wage thus has elasticity with respect to the factoral terms of trade
between 0 and 1, and the average real skilled wage will as well unless the skill
premium is sufficiently responsive to the factoral terms of trade. Globalization increases Γ and Γ∗ and by this channel it raises d ln Cd/ ln w. In contrast
to the Cobb-Douglas case, however, a change in t has effects on the distribution of d ln Pe(z)/d ln w that are difficult to sign. On balance, globalization
should ordinarily raise d ln C/d ln w and damp the real income response to
underlying aggregate shocks, as it does in the Cobb-Douglas case.
33

Now turn to the idiosyncratic income distribution properties of the model.
Ex post dispersion is induced by realizations of the productivity shocks.
For simplicity in thinking about the ex ante personal income risk that is
associated, suppress aggregate risk. The return to skilled labor is residually
determined in each sector. Thus r(z) = [1 − α(z)]p(z)y(z)/λ(z)K is the
sector specific return in z, where α(z) ≡ wL(z)/p(z)y(z) is labor’s share
R 1in z.
Replace p(z)y(z) with s(z)g. The average skilled wage is gK = (g/K) 0 [1 −
α(z)]s(z)dz = (1 − ᾱ)g/K. Then the sector z return relative to the mean is:
s(z) 1 − α(z)
r(z)
=
.
gK
λ(z) 1 − ᾱ

(30)

Using the value of marginal product conditions, α(z) = wh(Pe(z))λ(z)K/s(z)g.
Replace s(z) with Pe(z)f [h(Pe(z))]λ(z)K/g in the labor share and relative returns conditions to yield:
!
1
Pe(z)f [h(Pe(z))]K h(Pe(z))K
r(z)
=
−
.
gK
1 − ᾱ
g
g
This simplifies to
r(z) = Pe(z)f [h(Pe)] − h(Pe).

(31)

The distribution of skilled labor returns across sectors is characterized by
dr(z)
= h0 Pez ≤ 0.
dz
For tradable goods sectors Pez < 0 while for nontraded goods, Pez /Pe = 0. The
return in the non-traded goods sectors is equal to the cutoff sector returns
r(z̄) = r(z̄ ∗ ). Thus Proposition 4 holds for the general case.
Next, consider the effect of changes in w, the factoral terms of trade,
on the profile of specific factor returns. Differentiating (30) with respect to
ln w at the efficient allocation λ(z) = γ(z), the components that change are
s(z)/γ(z) and [1 − α(z)]/(1 − ᾱ). As for the change in s(z)/γ(z), differentiating (6),
∂ ln s(z)/γ(z)
= [1 − s(z)][1 + Pe(z)α(z)η(z)] > 0.
∂ ln w

34

where η(z) = h0 (·)Pe(z)/h(·) = −d ln L(z)/d ln w, the elasticity of demand
for labor in sector z.27 The first term on the right hand side 1 − s(z)/γ(z)
is increasing in z. The second term may be increasing or decreasing in z in
general. The change in [1 − α(z)]/(1 − ᾱ) due to change in w is similarly
ambiguous in its impact on the distribution of response of r(z)/gK to change
in w. The Cobb-Douglas case removes the ambiguity, yielding the implication
in Proposition 5 that the poorest sectors are hit the hardest by changes in
the factoral terms of trade. The Cobb-Douglas logic remains active in the
general case but qualified by possible offsetting influences from changes in
the distribution of unskilled labor shares and demand elasticities.
Next, consider the comparative statics of globalization. A fall in t raises
∗
z̄, z̄ , Γ(z̄) and Γ∗ (z̄ ∗ ). It generally has ambiguous effects on w. As for the
ex post distribution of skilled labor income, the dispersion of returns relative
to the average are increased. This arises for two reasons. First, export
sectors experience a price rise while import competing sectors experience a
price fall due to the fall in trade costs at constant factoral terms of trade.
Second, the expansion of the extensive margin of trade raises the sector
specific incomes of newly exporting sectors while lowering the sector specific
incomes of newly import-competing sectors. Thus Proposition 6 holds for
the general case. Globalization intensifies the impact of good or bad luck in
the choice of jobs by skilled labor. This is true for both countries. Viewed
ex ante, personal income is made more risky by globalization when there is
no aggregate productivity risk.
Globalization ordinarily would have some effect on the average skill premium, but general analytic results are precluded. For the CES production
function with σ > 1, globalization at constant terms of trade ordinarily raises
both ᾱ and ᾱ∗ and thus the average skill premium ordinarily falls in both
North and South. This property arises from consideration of

Export sectors experience rising s and rising α while contracting sectors
experience falling s and falling α. So the first and third terms on the right
hand side of the above equation must rise. The middle term should ordinarily
not change much because the mobile factor flows from import-competing to
27
The expression on the right uses 1 + Pe(z)α(z)η(z) = 1 + h0 (·)Pe(z)/f (·) where the
right hand expression is obtained from differentiating (6).

35

export sectors mainly. Finally, the fall in t should intuitively raise z̄ and
lower z̄ ∗ , further raising ᾱ. For the case of σ < 1, the effects through s and
α in the first and third terms reverse in sign, and the effect of globalization
should ordinarily raise the average skill premium in North and South.
Skill biased technological change has been suggested as the cause of a
worldwide rise in the skill premium. In contrast, the neutral technological
change used here suggests that a rise in the skill premium in both countries might be associated with globalization if elasticities of substitution are
greater than one. But allowing for skill-biased technological change introduces an important added determinant of skill premium distribution that
interacts with the previously analyzed forces.
Finally, relaxing the identical production functions assumption introduces
a host of complications that might greatly qualify the results. The key mechanism of the paper that allows simple results is that the allocation of skilled
labor can be derived as λ(z) = γ(z) = λ∗ (z) because all industries then give
the skilled worker equal prospects. Once the production functions differ,
it is no longer possible to allocate such that there are identical prospects
across sectors. The risk aversion of the skilled workers and the availability
and quality of risk sharing instruments then become crucial to characterizing
the equilibrium allocation. In some circumstances, globalization might lower
efficiency (Newbery and Stiglitz, 1984). See Helpman and Razin (1978) for
an analysis of allocation with risk-sharing with limited assets.
