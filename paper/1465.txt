International Comparison of the Sources of
Productivity Slowdown 1973-1982

ABS1RAC
This paper uses an integrated model of aggregate supply to analyze the
post-1973 slowdown in productivity growth in the seven major OECD economies.
Factor substitution, unexpected demand changes, profitability, and inventory
disequilibrium all contribute to the explanation, which is based on a
three-factor nested aggregate production function, including energy, and
postulating Harrod-neutral disembodied technical progress. The model is first
applied separately to the seven countries assuming constant (though
country-specific) rates of technical progress. This model provides empirical
evidence that this rate of progress has in fact slowed down for several of the
faster-growing countries, even after adjusting for factor substitution and
cyclical factors. The model is therefore re-estimated, and the sources of
productivity decline recalculated, on the hypothesis that rates of efficiency
growth in other countries are converging to those in the United States.

Introductjon*

What happened to productivity in the 1970s? Why has post-1973 growth
in output per employed person in the major OECD economies been so much slower

than it was between 1962 and 1973? These are key questions in economic
history, and their answers have important implications for economic policy.

Among the many papers devoted to this topic, analysing the problem either at
an aggregate level or for disaggregated industries, most have concluded that
there is a large residual to be explained, or have had to use rough guesses

and often inconsistent methods to allocate the blame among a large variety of

possible causes. Our study is based on the assumption that enough post-1973
history is now on record to permit using a more consistent and systematic
approach, in which a comparable yet fairly simple analytic framework is

applied to data from a number of countries. Errors in the explanation
generated by this framework will show the size of the remaining puzzle
requiring appeal to other models or additional influences.

In our analysis of the post-1973 slowdown in labour productivity growth
in the seven major OECD economies, we apply an aggregate three-factor model of
production behaviour that treats factor substitution, unexpected demand
changes, deviations from desired inventory levels and profitability in an

integrated and consistent manner. We proceed in two stages in a way that
illustrates two distinct elements of comparative macroeconomics: the first is
the use of comparable theory and data to assess productivity growth in a
number of countries, and the second is the development of an international
framework to explain the inter-country differences and possible future
evolution of long-term productivity growth.

-3-

In the first stage, we apply our model separately to comparable sets of
data for each of the countries, and use the results to disentangle the effects

of energy price changes from those of unexpected changes in demand and
profitability in explaining each country's post-1973 slowdown in the rate of

growth of output per employed person. The model used has a nested long-term
production function in which capital and energy are combined in a vintage CES
inner function, and this bundle then enters a Cobb-Douglas outer function with

efficiency units of labour.

At the first stage of the research long-run

technical progress is taken to be Harrod-neutral, occurring at a constant
annual rate.

Actual production is determined by a behavioural utilization

rate equation in which the ratio of actual output to that determined by the

production function (with given technical progress and normal utilization

rates for employed factors) is explained by unexpected changes in final
demand, abnormal profitability, and the discrepancy between actual and target

inventory levels. For all countries there is strong evidence that changes in

demand and profitability have led to important declines in the rate of
utilization of employed factors, and hence in the rate of growth of measured

total factor productivity and output per employed person, between 1973 and
1982. The post-1973 factor mix has also changed substantially, to use more

labour and less energy, thus leading to further reductions in the rate of
growth of output per employed person.

The first stage of our research also showed large international
differences in the underlying rate of Harrod-neutral technical progress, with
evidence of a slow-down in its rate of growth, even after adjusting for factor

mix and cyclical factors, in those countries with initially lower but rapidly

rising levels of labour efficiency.

We also found evidence of some

significant increases in labour income as a share of total factor payments in

-4-

countries where the cost of labour had risen faster than the rate of
Harrod-neutral technical progress, thus suggesting that the elasticity of
substitution between labour and the capital-plus-energy bundle may not be as
high as assumed by the use of a Cobb-Douglas outer function.

These results led us to a second stage of research in which the initial

model was further developed, on the basis of the first stage results, to
include an explanation of the international transmission and convergence of
technical progress.

As a separate development, we have also applied the

two-level production structure using the CES form at both levels, and
including simultaneous estimation of the derived factor demand equations
(Helliwell, Sturm and Salou, 1984).

In this paper, we shall concentrate on

the convergence model using the Cobb-Douglas outer function, with references

where appropriate to the two-level CES results. Thismarks a second distinct
phase of comparative international macroeconomics, where the uniform modelling

and comparison of production in national economies leads to a more general

framework in which increasing trade in goods and services, and especially
information and technology, tends toward international convergence of rates of

growth of labour efficiency. Since the United States shows the highest level
and the slowest rate of growth in Harrod-neutral technical progress of all of

the seven countries (except for the United Kingdom), and does not show
evidence of decline from the 1960s to the 1970s and l980s (after adjusting for

changes in cyclical position), its experience is used to approximate the rate
of growth of technical progress to which other countries are converging.

—5-

The logic of our approach suggests that we present the first stage
results in some detail, including the evidence that led us to proceed to the
second stage. This will permit the second-stage results to be presented more
concisely, since their underlying framework and basic pattern are similar, and

will permit a clearer view of what is at stake in moving from a constant to a
variable rate of technical progress.

cal and Theoretical_Background

Table

1 shows the average annual growth of output per employed person,

GDP per capita, and changes in various input and factor price ratios, in each
of the seven major OECD countries between 1973 and 1982, with the growth rates

between 1962 and 1973 given for comparison.

The average annual growth of

output per employed person fell by 2.5 percentage points from the pre-1973 to
the post-1973 period.

In all cases the average growth was less than half as
I

high

over the 1973-1982 period as over the 1962-73 period.

In the United

States and Canada, the countries with the lowest rates of growth of output

per employed person 1962-1973, there was almost no growth in output per
employed person from 1973 to 1982. Reference to statistics for productivity
growth in industrialised countries over a century or more cautions that the

twenty-five years of high productivity growth prior to 1973, especially
outside North America, may be the exceptional performance (1).

Thus any

satisfactory explanation of the post-1973 slowdown that implies a return to

1962-73 average growth rates of output per employed person should also be
consistent with the permanent transition to these growth rates from those
experienced in the first half of the century.

How has ecOnomic research responded to the problem of explaining the
large and pervasive slowdown in labour productivity growth since 1973? Nelson
(1981, pp 1029-30) describes contemporary research on productivity as showing

evidence of schizophrenia, with one set of studies characterised by
neo-classical production functions applied under the assumption of continuous
equilibirum, and a variety of other more eclectic approaches not relying on a

formal analytical framework. Attempts to disentangle cyclical factors from
other determinants of productivity growth are generally lacking from both sets

of studies (important exceptions are Mohr (1980) for U.S. manufacturing and
Kouri, de Macedo, and Viscio (1982) for French manufacturing), except insofar
as cyclical factors are included among the reasons for productivity slow-down

in some studies of the second type (e.g. Giersch, 1982;

Denison, 1982;

Lindbeck, 1982).

The presumption underlying our research is that this schizophrenia is
unnecessary and costly, since any robust explanation of the post-1973 changes

must deal in a coherent way with major changes in relative factor prices as

well as large and sustained departures from long-run macroeconomic
equilibrium.

The neo-classical production framework is necessary to deal

consistently with the effects of changes in factor prices, while the
assumption of continuous equilibrium must be dropped if cyclical elements are

to be treated properly. The production framework applied in this paper is
based on the assumption that the explanatory power of the neo-classical model

of production can best be harnessed by using it to provide an equilibrium

towards which the system tends to move, but from which there may be many
systematic departures.

The likely pervasiveness of these departures means

that it is necessary to avoid econometric procedures (such as the usual cost

share equations used for deriving substitution parameters in translog
production functions) that are only valid under conditions of continuous
equilibrium.

—7-.

Our approach has some similarities with that of Bruno in his
comparative studies of productivity slowdown in manufacturing (1984) and in

the private economy as a whole (1982).

Like us, he assumes an underlying

three-factor model of production, and permits short-term deviations of actual

output from normal output. He does, however, not use his production structure

to define a normal output series, and hence is not able to separate cleanly
the effects of factor substitution from those of factor utilization. From his

cross-section equation, he concludes (1982, p. 99) that about half of the

slowdown in private-sector productivity growth was due to import price
increases and half to demand slowdown.

His estimated import price effect

combines the influence of factor substitution with the impact of profitability
on utilization which is separately estimated in our model.

Sylos-Labini (1984) explains productivity growth in Italy and the
United States in terms of output growth, changes in the wage rate relative to

the price of machinery, and current and lagged investment rates. The first
term probably captures mainly cyclical effects, while the wage ratio probably

combines some factor substitution with some profitability effects.

By

treating the production decision and the definition of potential output in a
more explicit way, we are able to disentangle these separate influences more

clearly, and then later to use our integrated framework to test for the
possibility of general slowdown or country-specific catch-up effects in the
rate of growth of labour efficiency.

We turn now to our model and its results.

Production Structure and the Influence of Engç

production structure employed in the first stage of our

research is explained in detail in the technical annex,
three factor nested aggregate production function.

It consists of a

The inner CES function

combines capital and energy into a vintage capital-energy bundle which is
combined with efficiency units of labour in an outer Cobb-Douglas function to

define potential output.

Estimates of the relevant production function

parameters are presented in Table 2. Energy is singled out for treatment as a

separate factor of production, in addition to capital and labour, since its

relative price moved so differently in the pre-1973 and post-1973 periods,
leading to changes in output per employed person that need to be disentangled

from the other causes of changes in labour productivity.

Since energy is

treated as a separate factor of production, the output concept has to be
enlarged to include net energy imports (2).

Our choice of a nested structure with capital and energy combined in
the inner function follows earlier research conclusions (e.g. Berndt and Wood

1979) that the separability assumptions implied by this nesting are more
plausible than the alternatives.

We restricted our choice to production

function structures that can be represented explicitly by their primary forms,

as well as by their dual cost functions, so that we are able to have an
explicit factor-based measure of potential output, and hence can decompose
output per employed person into two key ratios:

Q/NE = (Q/QSv).(QSVINE)

(1)

Where:

Q

= actual

NE

=

number of employed persons, and

QSV

=

output

output,

defined by the production function, with all quantities

of employed factors operating at normal utilization rates.

-9-.

We employ a flexible vintage structure for the capital and energy
bundle. Some vintage structure is likely to be required since much capital

equipment and many buildings are designed to embody a certain energy
requirement. However, it would not be appropriate to apply a rigid vintage
model, in which energy requirements were held fixed at their initial levels
until the capital is scrapped, because there is much in the way of adjustment

and retrofitting that can be done to change the energy use of the existing
capital stock. We therefore designed our vintage model so that the degree of

retrofitting should be a parameter to be estimated simultaneously with the
long-term elasticity of substitution between capital and energy in the CES
bundle. The distribution parameters in the inner CES bundle are derived from
the assumption that the actual and desired energy/capital ratios are equal on

average over the ainple period, and by scaling the mean of KEV to have the
same mean as K, so that the derived CES dual cost index for capital and energy:

PKE=(b.PK +

c5.PE)11'5)

(2)

measures the cost (after vintage effects have been worked out) of owning and

providing energy for one unit of the capital stock.

For any given pair of

values for the retrofitting parameter (LU in Table 2) and the elasticity of
substitution (s) between capital and energy, equation 8 in the technical Annex

defines the vintage energy requirement EV (3). Using EV as a predictor of E,
Table 2 shows the maximum likelihood pairs of Ri and s for each of the seven

countries. The long-term elasticity of substitution ranges from .6 to .95
(the highest value considered).

If those values seem high, it should be

remembered that they refer to energy as it is priced for final users,
including all taxes and distribution charges, and that those prices have moved

less than proportionately in response to changes in world crude oil prices,

-10-

even in those countries where world crude oil price changes were passed on
immediately to final users.

There is wider variation in values for the

retrofitting parameter, which in some countries is not very precisely
determined statistically, and in any case is likely to get confused with the

numerous non-price policies that several countries adopted to speed the
conservation of energy, and especially of crude oil, following the world oil
price shocks of 1973-74 and 1979-80. These latter policies may, for example,

have combined with the increasing availability of natural gas service to
explain the estimated high speed of the U.K. response.

Examination of the various country panels in Figure 1 shows why the

elasticity of substitution and the retrofitting parameter both tend to be
high, and also why there is a trade-off between RI and s in the likelihood
surfaces for several countries. In all seven countries there were matching

decreases in relative energy prices and in capital/energy ratios prior to
1973, with the trends reversed thereafter.

How big were the effects of energy price changes on factor
substitution, and hence on the rate of growth of output per employed person?

The answer to this question depends on the properties of each country's
production function. So far we have explained the method for obtaining the
parameters of the inner CES function, and for defining the quantity and price

of the bundle of capital plus energy. The higher price of energy leads to a
substitution of capital for energy and also to a rise in the price index for

capital plus energy, leading to substitution of labour for the bundle of
capital and energy. The size and speed of this substitution depend on the
parameters of the outer function and on the speed with which actual employment
and the capital stock respond to changes in desired factor proportions.

The Cobb-Douglas form for the outer function implies a unit
of substitution between efficiency units of labour and

energy bundle.

of the capital -

The exponents of the outer function are based on average

nominal income shares over the entire sample period. The labour efficiency
index and the constant term are defined from the requirement that QSV, the

value of normal output defined by the production function at normal
utilization rates and steady trend increases in labour efficiency, should have

the same mean and trend as actual output Q over the entire sample period.
The implied constant rates of growth of the labour efficiency indexes for each
country are shown in Table 2.

To compute the substitution effects of energy prices on labour
productivity, it matters what is held constant, and on the time lags involved

in adjusting capital/labour ratios. Since our first stage research does not
otherwise require estimated equations for employment and investment, we shall
report results on the basis of full adjustment, and shall therefore refer only

to the effects of the two long movements in energy prices relative to the

prices of capital and labour: down from 1962 to 1973 and up from 1973 to
1982.

Table 3 shows the results for each country, under the assumption of

given levels of output and full adjustment of relative factor inputs.

The

first column shows by how much lower was 1973 equilibrium employment as a
consequence of energy prices following their actual paths rather than staying

at their 1962 values relative to the price of capital goods.

The second

column shows the amount by which equilibrium employment in 1982 increased
because of the increase in relative energy prices between 1973 and 1982. The

third column shows the combined effect of these two changes in terms of the

reduction they imply in the average annual rate of increase in output per

employed person from the first sub-period (1962-1973) to the second
(1973-1982).

The Importance and Explanation of Variations in Factor Utilization

If it is true, as we assume, that there are systematic changes in the

rate of utilization of employed factors, and hence in output per employed
person, then it should be possible to estimate an output equation, including
cyclical variables, that substantially improves on the prediction of output by
the production function on its own.

Tne regression results reported in Table 4 show that this condition is

very easily met for all of the seven countries, as the cyclical variables

explain a significant proportion of any variations in output not already

explained by variations in QSV.

For each country the ratio Q/QSV is

significantly reduced when average unit costs are high relative to the output

price and significantly increased when final sales are high relative to what

firms were expecting them to be when they made the factor demand decisions
whose results are embodied in QSV.

Do these systematic departures from the long-term production function
mean that firms are getting something for nothing when utilization rates are

high, or being heedlessly wasteful when utilization rates are low? Before
interpreting the results it might be useful to explain why not, by sketching a

short-term optimization process that would lead producers, in the aggregate,
to respond in the way revealed by the equations reported in Table 4.

It is costly and time-consuming to adjust capital, employment, and
energy-intensity, and the size and profitability of future sales cannot be
forecast with any precision.

productive capacity --

Firms deal with this situation by planning their

buildings,

equipment, production schedules, marketing

-13-

facilities, supply contracts, and so on --

to

support an expected level of

sales at some average desired rate of utilization.

They recognize the

inevitability of unexpected changes in demand and cost conditions by investing

in short-term flexibility until the point where the expected costs of more
flexibility start to exceed the expected benefits. Many of the devices that
individual firms use to provide short-term flexibility, through contracts that

transfer the extra demands to other suppliers, or by arrangements to purchase

goods or services at short notice from other firms, are not available to the

economy as a whole, except through the more limited extent permitted by
additional imports of goods and services.

Given whatever margin of spare

capacity firms provide for themselves, they react to an unanticipated increase

in final demand by some combination of:

increases in capital, labour, and

energy inputs (thereby inceasing QSV), running down inventories, raising
prices, and increasing the utilization rate of employed factors. The feasible

set of points for the short-term production function is a band about the
longer-term function with given, or only slightly variable, quantities of
employed factors.

The optimal choice of the current production level can be thought of as

the selection of a fourth factor input, "factor utilization" which is not
independently measurable except partially through data for working hours,
number of shifts, and so on. The preferred rate of utilization will depend on

its own cost relative to the costs of alternative means of dealing with
changes in demand or cost conditions. The cost of higher utilization rates is
not precisely measurable, but comprises some combination of increased risk of
production failure (from human or mechanical stress, neglected maintenance, or

control procedures ignored in the search for higher output levels), lower

quality of output, and lack of time to plan for future innovations and

-14-

investment. The costs of the alternatives --

inventory

destocking, increased

imports, price increases, and hence foregone sales -- cannot be measured
precisely either, but it is possible to find measured variables that influence
them.

For example, the marginal cost of running down inventories may be

expected to increase as inventory stocks fall further from their target
levels, and the opportunity cost of foregone sales will be inversely related

to unit costs and positively related to the output price.

Thus the CQ

variable (which represents current unit costs divided by the output price)
will negatively affect the demand for utilization as a short term factor of
production, as will the stock of inventories at the beginning of the period.

changes in these variables not only influence how the firm will respond to a

change in demand conditions, hut will also lead to the choice of a new
short-term utilization rate.

Thus the inventory and cost terms enter in

log-linear form with the unexpected or temporary sales variable, which in turn

is defined as final sales divided by QSV since QSV represents that portion of

final sales that was forecast to be sufficiently permanent and profitable to
be provided for by domestic factors operating at normal utilisation rates.

Since any deviation of the short-term utilization rate from unity is a

measure of macroeconomic disequilibrium, it may be expected to have an
important explanatory role elsewhere in the macroeconomic system, influencing
imports, prices, wages, and factor demands. In the macroeconomic framework of

which this explicit production model is a part (Helliwell et al, 1984),
inventory change is determined as production plus net imports minus final

sales, and the ratio of actual to desired inventories itself plays an
important role in determining the path of macroeconomic adjustment, chiefly
through its effects on prices, exports, and production.

—15—

One advantage of a direct explanation of the short-term production
decision in relation to an explicit long-term production function is that it

permits a consistent allocation of the proximate causes of productivity
slowdown between cyclical elements and factor substitution. To get to the
bottom of the matter, of course, requires an explanation of what causes sales,

costs, relative prices, and inventory stocks to take the values they do. This
would require complete and comparably specified macroeconomic country models,

so that shock-free histories could be constructed for each of the countries
and then actual external shocks and internal policies added to assess their
individual and collective importance in determining the extent and timing of

the productivity slowdown. This has so far only been done for the Canadian
case (Helliwell 1984);

to undertake that work on a comparative basis would

take us beyond the scope of this paper.

We shall restrict ourselves in this paper to a comparison of the
proximate causes of the productivity slowdown.

Table S splits the overall

decline in the annual rate of growth of output per employed person (Q/NE) into
two components, normal output per employed person (QSV/NE) and the utilization

rate (Q/QSv), which is the ratio of actual output to what it would be if all

employed factors were utilized at normal rates. The growth of normal output

per employed person is dominated by the rate of growth of the labour
efficiency index, but is also influenced importantly by price-induced factor

substitution, as evidenced especially by the effects of changes in energy
prices. The first stage results assume a constant rate of increase in labour
efficiency, so that the change in the average annual growth of QSV/NE from the
pre-1973 to the post-1973 period is due to changes in relative factor prices.

-16-

The remaining columns of Table S disentangle the various causes of the

changes in Q/QSV.

In equilibrium growth, QIQSV is always equal to 1.0,

because there are no surprises to stop the planned increases in factors being

just sufficient to produce the desired level of output at normal utilization
rates.

In a period of normal growth, therefore, changes in Q/QSV would

contribute nothing, either positively or negatively, to changes in output per
employed person.

But things were not normal in either of the subperiods.

There were abnormal increases between 1962 and 1973 in the main determinants
of capacity utilization, followed by abnormal decreases from 1973 to 1982.

Figures 2, 3 and 4 show, respectively, the sales, cost, and inventory

variables for each of the seven countries, and Table 5 shows the amount by
which changes in each of these variables contributed to the slowdown in the
average annual rate of growth of output per employed person from the 1962-1973

period to the 1973-1982 period. What do the results show? First, some common

elements. In all countries, 1973 was a year of greater capacity utilization
than either 1962 or 1982, so that changes in capacity utilization increased
the average annual rate of growth of output per employed person in the first

sub period and lowered it in the second.

In all countries, the demand and

cost variables both contributed importantly to the drop in capacity
utilization from 1973 to 1982, the former usually more than the latter. This

was quite different from the earlier period, where the increase in capacity
utilization from 1962 to 1973 was almost entirely due to sales not matched by
increases in normal output, with the cost variable usually playing a slightly

negative role.

If one then looks at the difference between the two

sub-periods, the sales term thus appears to have much the greatest importance,

as it was the primary positive contributor during the first sub-period and a
substantial negative contributor during the second.

-17-

What are the major differences in the country results? First, cyclical
factors have been much more important in the United States and Canada than in
the other countries. Second, the production equation fits best for the United

States, and least well for Germany.

Only in Germany is the unexplained

residual a substantial proportion of the overall productivity slowdown.

Inventories play an important buffer role in most countries (the sales
coefficient being significantly less than 1.0) except for the United Kingdom

where the sales coefficient is above 1.0, suggesting that desired inventory

stocks move substantially in response to current sales. The coefficient on
the cost variable is fairly well identified in the range -.16 to -.35. The
contribution of the cost variable to productivity slowdown is less uniform
since, as shown in Figure 3, the variable has behaved rather differently in
the seven countries, although generally moving in an adverse direction for all

countries since 1973. Finally, as shown in Table 2, the underlying rate of
Harrod-neutral technical progress differs very much from country to country,

being less than half as high in the United States, the United Kingdom, and
Canada as in any of the other four countries.

As a check on our results from the first stage research, we tested for

constancy of the underlying rate of Harrod-neutral technical progress by
adding a quadratic trend term to the regression used to define the technical

progress index.

We found a significant negative coefficient for all

countries. When we added a calculated utilization rate (using exogenous
instrumental variables for all right-hand side variables) to provide a rough
cyclical adjustment, we found that the quadratic term became insignificant for

the United States, Italy, and Canada, but remained significant elsewhere. The
apparent decline in the rate of technical progress in some countries, combined
with the very large intercountry differences in the average rates of technical

-18-

progress suggested the need for a framework that would permit technical
progress to be linked between countries, and possibly to converge.

This

further development is described in the following section, after which we
shall sumrnarjse our overall results and search for suitable conclusions.

5.

International Convergence of

Our first stage results provided evidence that, for most of the seven

countries, though not for the United States, some decline in the rate of
1-larrod-neutral technical progress has occurred during the period 1962-1982,

even after due allowance for factor substitution and the effect of cyclical
changes in total factor utilization.

Since the United States showed the highest level of output per employed

person throughout the observation period, and the least evidence of any
decline in productivity growth, after accounting for factor substitution and

utilization effects, it was used as the basis for testing the convergence

hypothesis. We chose a simple form for the hypothesis, with the rate of
change of labour efficiency being related to the previous period's ratio of
the U.S. to the domestic labour efficiency variable. Under this hypothesis,
the rate of change of labour efficiency eventually converges to the same rate
in all countries, although the unconstrained logarithmic constant term permits

the level of output per employed person to be different among countries (e.g.
because of differing social structures, hours of work, resource endowments and
education levels) even after convergence is achieved in the rates of change.

-19-

The use of a country-specific constant means that we are estimating
separate dynamic models for each country, with or without the constraint that

the catch-up coefficient be the same for each country. This differs from the

equations tested by Lindbeck (1983, p. 33) and by Giersch and Wolter (1983,
p. 40) which use only cross-section data, with the implicit assumption that in

equilibrium each country would have the same productivity growth rate and
level (4).

The Giersch and Wolter equations also differ from ours in not

adjusting the variables to reflect the effets of factor substitution.
Nordhaus (1982) includes catch-up effects as one of the elements of his
'depletion' factor, to which he attributes a large part of the post-1973
reduction in productivity growth. His estimates are not comparable to ours,
however, as he does not separate catch-up effects from other elements of his
depletion factor.

Table 6 shows the precise form of the equations estimated, and
estimation results when applied to pooled 1961-1982 data for Germany, France,
the United Kingdom, Italy, and Canada. It is applied separately to Japan, for

which the available data cover only the 1967-1982 period.

For the pooled

data, four versions of the equation are estimated and compared with two

versions of a competing hypothesis that the rate of change of labour
productivity, after adjustment for factor substitution, is a linear function
of time. The nul hypothesis is that the efficiency index rises at a constant

rate, which would mean that none of the equations in Table 6 would have any

explanatory power except through contamination by correlation between the
included variables and the excluded cyclical variables.

-20-

The equations shown in Table 6 are all based on the two-level nested
Cobb-Douglas/CES production function and are thus directly comparable with the

production structure used in the first part of the paper.

We have also

estimated equations based on the two-level nested CES structure with an 0.6
elasticity of substitution in the outer function, and found them to be almost
identical, and that is why we need present only the first set in Table 6.

The four pooled catch-up equations use alternatively the logarithm of
the U.S. efficiency index and the logarithm of the productivity ratio data on
which it was estimated, and either do or do not impose the constraint that the

catch-up coefficient is the same for all countries. Of the two regressions

assuming a quadratic time trend for the efficiency index, one applies the
constraint that the coefficient be the same for all countries, and the other
does not.

There are two Japanese equations, one using the actual data for U.S.
output per employed person (after adjusting for other factor inputs, as shown

in Table 6) and the other using the estimated efficiency index (with a
constant rate of growth) based on those data.

What do the results show? First, all of the pooled equations have
significant explanatory power relative to the nul hypothesis that the labour
efficiency index grows at a constant rate.

Second, the constraint that all

countries have the same response coefficients is generally not easily
accepted, although the catch-up coefficients are quite similar among countries

in the equation based on the estimated U.S. efficiency index. Third, none of
the equations explain a very high proportion of the year-to-year variations in

the dependent variable. This is not surprising since the latter is defined to

—21—

remove the effects of long-run factor substitution, but not to remove the
short-run cyclical effects.

Finally, and probably as a consequence of the

cyclical variance, the best £ it is provided by the equation using the actual

U.S. data, the second best by the time trend, and the third best by the
computed U.S. labour efficiency index. Since the former two are more likely
to be contaminated by cyclical variance and its international simultaneity,

and since quadratic time trends for efficiency indexes have no theoretical

foundation and have forecasting properties that eventually imply negative
technical progress, we use the catch-up equations based on the computed U.S.

efficiency index as a basis for the estimated and forecast labour efficiency
indexes for each country shown in Figure 5.

In Tables 7 and 8 we present the results of integrating the catch-up

hypothesis in the overall model of production behaviour, based on a unit
elasticity of substitution between the capital-energy bundle and efficiency
units of labour. Table 7 shows the parameters of the re-estimated production

equations, and Table 8 shows the revised model's allocation of the factors

leading to changes in output per employed person from the pre-1973 to the

post-1973 period. Table 8 is like Table S for the first stage production
model, but also decomposes the change in normal output per employed person
(QSV/NE) into two parts, one due to growth in the efficiency index and the
second due to changes in factor substitution.

The catch-up model increases the share of the productivity slowdown

(outside the United States) that is due to slower growth of QSV/NE, and
correspondingly reduces the amount requiring explanation by cyclical factors

or left as an unexplained residual.

The catch-up effect is especially

important for Japan, Italy, France and Germany, in that order, as in each case

-22-

it suggests that one-third of the slowdown of average annual increase in
output per employed person could be due to the catch-up effect. There is not,

except in Germany and the United Kingdom, any substantial increase in the

overall ability of the model to explain production and the productivity
slowdown, as both versions of the model have rather small residuals. We turn
now to a comparison of the results of the two versions of the production model.

6.

Summary and implications for future productivity growth

In Table 9 we draw together and compare the results from both stages of

our research. The left-hand column shows the total slowdown, in each country,
of the rate of growth of GDP per employed person. The second column shows the

change in net energy imports, and the third column (equal to col. 1 minus
col. 2) is the slowdown in the rate of growth of output per employed person,
the variable directly explained by both versions of our model of production.
The remaining columns then show how the two versions of the model explain the
declining rate of productivity growth.

Figure 5 shows the implications of the catch-up model for the past and

future growth of the labour efficiency index in each of the seven countries,
based on purchasing-power-parity exchange rates and cyclically-adjusted labour

income from two alternative base years, 1970 and 1982 (5).

For reasons

explained below, we think that the current version of the catch-up model
overstates the degree of catch-up and hence understates future efficiency
growth in Japan and some of the other countries with high rates of growth of
constant Harrod-neutral technical progress in the Model I results reported in
Table 2.

-23-

Figure 6 shows the rates of utilization of employed factors, Q/QSV, for

both versions of the model. The catch-up model, by markedly slowing the
recent rates of growth of potential output for several countries, has the
effect of reducing the amount of underutilization at the end of the sample
period, and hence the size of future increases in output per employed person

as utilization rates eventually return to normal. We should emphasise that
QSV measures the level of output, at normal utilization rates, of employed

factors, and is not intended to measure what the economy could produce if
there were increases in employment or the capital stock. In general, anything

that increases Q/QSV, if it signals profitable future output, leads to
subsequent increases in investment and employment, and hence to increases in
QSV.

By reducing the recent growth of QSV, and hence tilting the series for
Q/QSV and S/QSV, the catch-up model has the effect, for several countries, of
transferring much of the explanation of productivity slowdown from unexpected

changes in sales to unavoidable catch-up.

We turn now to a brief

country-by-country comparison of the results from the two versions of the
model.

For the United States, the total decline to be explained is the
smallest, (1.87 per cent), and there is only one version of the model to be
consulted, since there was no evidence of slowdown beyond that which could be

explained by cyclical factors. More than three-quarters of the total was
explained by unexpected or temporary sales changes, with more than half of
that amount due (as shown in Table 5) to unexpectedly rapid (or temporary)

increases in sales up to 1973, illustrating once more the point that the
pre-1973 period was itself an abnormal one.

The remaining change in U.S.

productivity growth was due to increases in costs, offset slightly by a fall

-24-

in the level of actual relative to desired inventories. Factor substitution
plays a relatively small aggregate role in the United States (as in France,
the United Kingdom and Canada) (6).

The Japanese slowdown is the largest of all, (5.4 per cent) and is the

most affected by application of the catch-up model. In both versions of the
model, more than 2 per cent of the 5.4 per cent is due to factor substitution,

and this amount, as in the other countries, is not materially altered by the

choice between the two models. Application of the catch-up model cuts the
estimated impact of changes in unexpected sales from 3.2 per cent per year to

about 1.2 per cent per year, while changing the effect of the cost variable
much less, reducing its contribution from .34 per cent to .24 per cent. The

unexplained residual in the catch-up model is larger than in the initial
model, but is less than .2 per cent per year in either case, a very small
fraction of the total slowdown. Which set of results is more likely to be
correct? It is most important to answer this question for the Japanese case,

for here the gap between the two sets of results is largest.

We have

deliberately set up the two models so that they are likely to bracket the
right answer.

The first stage model understates the catch-up effect by

forcing it to be zero, while model II overstates it because of the
collinearity between the included catch-up variable and the excluded cyclical

variables in the estimated equations reported in Table 6. This is especially
likely to lead to an overstatement of the catch-up effect for Japan, where the

data period is several years shorter than for the other countries. Although
it is possible to try to identify more precisely the relative impacts of the

catch-up and cyclical variables, it will be difficult to do so with much
precision without application of cross-country restrictions in regressions
that

pool

time-series and cross-country data.

-25-

The German slowdown is of about average size (2.4 per cent), with about

one-third due to factor substitution. Germany is the only country for which

the profit squeeze was worse during the pre-1973 period than during the
subsequent one;

even though the unit cost ratio (relative to the output

price) rose after 1973 (as shown in Figure 3) it did so at a slower rate than

before, so that the cost factor reduced the slowdown by .1 per cent per
annum.

In

either model, the effects of unanticipated sales changes were

smaller in Germany than in any of the other countries.

In both models, the

unexplained residual is larger than in any of the other countries, and is
almost one-third of the total slowdown.

The French slowdown of 2.2 per cent is explained in model I by sales
and profits, with the former three times as important as the latter. Model II

shifts 1.5 per cent of slowdown to the catch-up effect, drawing most of it
from the unexpected sales term, whose importance is cut by a factor of three.
The unexplained residuals are small for the two models.

The United Kingdom slowdown was fairly large (2.6 per cent), but not

much affected by the choice between models. Sales changes remain the most
important determinant, and the catch-up effect is small.

This is to be

expected, as the U.K. had the slowest average productivity growth 1962-1973.

Italy has a large slowdown (4.4 per cent), of which almost 2 per cent
is attributed to catch-up in model II. Factor substitution is responsible for

more than 1 per cent in both models, and most that is not due to catch-up or

factor substitution is traced to sales. Profits effects are about average,
and the residuals are small in both models.

-26-

Canada has a moderately large slowdown (2.5 per cent). The catch-up
effect is the smallest since it was estimated to have been largely complete by

the mid-l970s. The contribution from the profits variable is larger than for

any other country reflecting (as shown in Figure 3) the sharpest post-1973
rise in costs relative to output prices.

What do the results suggest about the usefulness of our approach, and

about the prospects for future productivity growth? Our work is still
progressing, but thus far appears to confirm our view that it is practicable

and informative to analyse and make international comparisons of growth in
aggregate labour productivity in a way that consistently accounts for factor
substitution, factor utilization, and long-run increases in labour efficiency.

In our modelling of production and productivity, we found substantial
effects from energy prices and from cyclical forces in all seven countries in
explaining the slowdown in productivity growth since 1973. These effects were
exaggerated by the fact that the pre-1973 and the post-1973 periods were both
unusual. Relative energy prices in all countries declined substantially prior
to 1973, causing energy to be substitued for other factors, and hence raising

the average rate of growth of output per employed person. After 1973, the
process was reversed, and caused the growth of output per employed person to

be substantially less than if energy prices had remained constant, or had
continued to fall as they had prior to 1973. Given the post-1973 rises in
energy prices, that part of the productivity slowdown due to substitution of

labour for energy represents an improvement in efficiency, since it is
required to produce any given level of output at least cost.
important

It is therefore

to separate these substitution effects when analysing and

forecasting the rate of increase in output per employed person. This factor

-27-

substitution exaggerated the underlying rate of productivity growth before

1973, and reduced it afterwards; future relative energy price changes are
likely to be smaller and hence to produce intermediate results.

The pre-1973 and post-1973 periods were also both abnormal with respect

to cyclical effects on output per employed person.
unexpected sales, especially the latter,

Profitability and

were on average adding to

utilization rates between 1962 and 1973 and reducing them between 1973 and
1982. Since 1982 was an abnormally bad year for profitability and sales in
most of the seven countries, eventual restoration of normal operating rates
(which may result from reduction in factor inputs as well as from increases in

output) will mean that increases in output per employed person will be
abnormally high during the adjustment period.

Thus, both energy prices and cyclical factors caused the 1962 to 1973
growth of output per employed person to be unusually high and the 1973 to 1982
growth to be unusually low.

If real energy prices remain fairly constant over

the rest of the decade, then energy substitution is not likely to be very
important, although the full substitution effects of the pre-1982 energy price

increases are still being worked out.

Starting from 1982, the cyclical

effects on labour productivity are bound to be positive as normal utilization

rates are restored.

Putting cyclical and energy price effects together,

output per employed person is likely to rise faster than normal in all
countries over the next few years.

But what is the normal rate of growth of productivity? This was the
key question addressed in the second stage of our research.

In the first

stage, we assumed a constant rate of increase in long-run labour efficiency.

-28-

Two features of our results suggested further work.

First, we found large

international differences in the average rate of Harrod-neutral technical
progress, being just above 1 per cent in the United States, Canada and the
United Kingdom, and above 3 per cent in Japan, Germany,

France

and Italy.

This led us to ask what caused those differences, and to question whether they

provided a useful basis for forecasts of the future growth of supply
potential. Second, we tested for evidence of decline in the growth rate of
the underlying rate of technical progress, and found it, even after adjusting
for factor substitution and cyclical factors, in most of the countries except
the United States and the United Kingdom.

These results from the first stage of our research led us to develop
and integrate into our production model an international catch-up hypothesis

whereby all countries eventually converge to the U.S. rate of technical
progress, which itself is unaffected by the convergence process.

We are

considering extensions of this hypothesis where the convergence could be to
some rate other than that of the United States, with that central rate subject

to stochastic evolution rather than being fixed. Any extensions of this sort

would require that cyclical and factor substitution effects be taken into
account in the pooled regressions.

We are also including the investment/capital ratio in the catch-up

equations to test the hypothesis that there is an important element of
capital-embodiment in harnessing the benefits of technical progress.

To

facilitate these extensions, we are planning to apply the model to a larger

group of OEGD countries. This will provide a stronger empirical base for
determining the appropriate split between cyclical and catch—up effects in the
explanation and projection of productivity trends.

-29-

The projections in Figure 5 of future growth in labour efficiency in
each country, based on the catch-up model, should be treated with caution as

the results of preliminary work. As we suggested above in our discussion of

the Japanese results, our current estimates of the catch-up effect are
probably biased upwards by correlation between the catch-up variable and
cyclical factors. Thus the most likely estimate of the future rate of growth

of labour efficiency in each country but the United States is probably more
than shown in Figure 5 but less than implied by the constant rates of Harrod
neutral technical progress reported in Table 2.

Further refinements are not

likely to alter our conclusion that it is difficult but important to consider
the evolution of aggregate technical progress within a model, such as the one
we have presented, which treats long-run technical progress consistently with
factor substitution and cyclical effects.

We have so far found the framework useful for assessing and comparing
the proximate causes of the observed productivity slowdown.

It has permitted

the residual element to be sharply reduced, and provides a coherent aggregate

supply model that can, in the context of a more complete macroeconometric
model, be used to go behind the changes in profitability, sales, and factor

prices to provide a macroeconomic analysis of the underlying domestic and
international sources of the productivity slowdown.

opinions

expressed in this paper are those of the

authors and do not necessarily represent the official view of the OECD.

For example, in none of the 16 OECD countries studied by Maddison
(1982, page 96) was the average annual rate of growth of GDP per man
hour in excess of 3 per cent in either of the 40-year periods prior to

1950, and for the group of countries it averaged 1.6% annually from
1870 to 191.3 and 1. 8% from 1913 to 1950.

By contrast, the growth of

GDP per man-hour averaged 4.5 per cent annually for the group between
1950 and 1973 and it exceeded 3.0% in 14 of the 16 countries.

From

1973 to 1979, it grew much less rapidly than 1950-73 but at an average

rate of 2.7%, and in most countries outside North America it grew by
more than in either of the sub periods between 1870 and 1950.

(2)

The inputs of capital and labour have not yet been correspondingly
adjusted to remove capital and labour employed in the production and
distribution of energy.

Earlier applications of the framework to

adjusted Canadian data have shown the employment adjustment to be small
and without consequence.

The adjustment of the capital stock is large

-31-

in the Canadian case, and influences the results, since investment in
energy was a significantly larger fraction of total investment in the
1970s than in the 1960s.

The same is likely to be true for the United

States and the United Kingdom.

Adjustment of capital stock data for

the other countries in the big seven is less likely to influence the

results significantly. Efforts to adjust the capital stock data for
all seven countries are underway.

(3)

The recursive formulation requires an initial value for EV, provided by

making it equal to E at the beginning of the data period.

Since

relative energy prices were moving fairly smoothly and predictably in
the early 1960s, this assumption of initial equilibrium is not likely
to cause problems.

(4)

Marris (1982) also applies an implicit catch-up model to cross-section

data for a number of OECD economies by explaining each country's

capita GDP growth rate by an equation that includes

1965-73

positive effects from export growth and the investment ratio, and a
negative effect from the level of GDP

the period.

capita at the beginning of

This formulation implies the implausible equilibrium

property that productivity growth is approaching zero in all countries,

including the United States. (It is, however, to be preferred in this

respect to the quadratic trend model, which implies productivity
changes eventually turning negative).

When used to attribute the

reasons for the 1973-79 productivity slowdown, it therefore combines

catch-up effects with a general slow-down, thus overstating the
catch-up

effects.

-32-

(5)

The efficiency indicators plotted in Figure 5 have been computed from
national GDP figures in U.S.-$ purchasing power parities for 1970 aid

1982 as published in OED (1984, p. 98). These output figures were
first adjusted for deviations from normal factor utilisation rates
(dividing them by QIQSV), then multiplied by the equilibrium labour
share (1-a), and divided by the number of employed persons. The 1970

figures were then expressed in 1982 prices. The resulting base year
figures for 1970 and 1982 were multiplied by the base-year-compatible
labour efficiency index computed in the second stage of our research.

Level differences between the efficiency indicators based on 1970 and
1982 U.S.-$ purchasing power parities are due to terms-of-trade changes
as well as to changes in inter-country differences in capital and other

resource endowments per employed person.

The country ordering

according to labour efficiency levels in 1973 implicit in Figure 5
corresponds closely to a country ordering according to total factor
productivity levels in an earlier study by Christensen et al (1980).

Level differences in labour efficiency between the U.S. and other

countries are, however, much bigger in our study compared to
Christensen et al, mainly because the latter adjust their productivity
measure also for hours worked and labour quality.

(6)

At least in part this is because the energy capital stock data are not

yet available to permit their exclusion from the total capital stock.
Experiments with the Canadian data, where this adjustment has been made
for other work, show that the effect can be important.

The coefficient for the inventory variable (KIB(-fl/QSV) is
determined statistically in the Q/V regressions except in

not well
the case of

the United States. Given the importance of this coefficient for the
dynamic behaviour of a complete model in which the Q/(V equation is
imbedded. an intermediate value of --0.07 for a. falling between the
estimates obtained for the two alternative U.S. equations reported in
Tables 4 and 7, was imposed on all countries.

(a) Figures shown are computed as the average annual growth rate of the labour efficiency index (over the period specified) multiplied by the
units in the
equilibrium labour income share (1-a). This implies that labour input and cost are defined in natural rather than
of inter-factor substitution. Defining labour input and cost in efficiency units would result in allocating all of the labour
efficiency growth to Column 2, reducing the figures in Column 3 correspondingly.
