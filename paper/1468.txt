Wealth

Portfolio

Composition: Theory and Evidence

ABSTRACT

In this paper, we examine a new survey of 6,oio U.S. households and estimate a model for the allocation of total net worth among different assets. The
paper has three main aims. The first is to investigate the extent to which a
conventional portfolio choice model can explain the differences in portfolio
composition among households. Our survey data show that most households hold
only a subset of the available assets. Hence we analyze a model in which
investors choose to hold incomplete portfolios. We show that the empirical specification of the joint discrete and continuous choice that characterizes household portfolio behavior is a switching regressions model with endogenous
switching.
The second aim is to examine the impact of taxes on portfolio composition.
The survey contains a great deal of information on taxable incomes and deductions which enable us to calculate rather precisely the marginal tax rate facing
each household.
The third aim is to estimate wealth elasticities of demand for a range of
assets and liabilities. We test the frequently made assumption of constant
relative risk aversion.

Introduction
Empirical studies of household savings behavior have focused primarily on

the total level of savings rather than its allocation among different types of

assets. Although there is a substantial theoretical literature on portfolio
behavior, there are few empirical studies of the composition of household
portfolios using individual data and these studies are rather dated. For
example, Bluine and Friend (1975), Feldstein (1976), and Projector and Weiss

(1966) used the 1962 Federal Reserve Board data, and Uhier and Cragg (1971) used
data from the 1960—62 Michigan Surveys of Consumer Finances. In this paper, we

examine a new survey of 6,oio U.S. households and estimate a model for the
allocation of total net worth among different assets.

The paper has three main aims. The first is to investigate the extent to
which a conventional portfolio choice model can explain the differences in

portfolio composition among households. In the finance literature the model
has been tested using data on security prices rather than household asset

demands. Our survey data show that most households hold only a subset of the

available assets. Hence we analyze a model in which investors choose to hold
incomplete portfolios. We show that the empirical specification of the joint
discrete and continuous choice that characterizes household portfolio behavior

is a switching regressions model with endogenous switching. This involves esti—
mating equations both for the probability of owning particular combinations of

—2--

assets (the discrete choice), and for the asset demand system conditional upon
ownership (the continuous choice).

The

survey contains a great deal of information on taxable incomes and

deductions

which enable us to calculate rather precisely the marginal tax rate

facing each household. Much of the current interest in tax reform, and the
debate over the merits of income or consumption as the personal tax base,

concerns the distortions created by the present tax system in the composition of

household savings. Proposals

for reform often include the elimination of

deductions for a range of tax—sheltered investments. Yet there is

very little

empirical

evidence on the effect of taxes on portfolio composition; only

Feldstein

(19T6) has

examined this issue with U.S. data.

The third aim is to

estimate wealth elasticities of demand for a range of

assets and liabilities. Although. mich attention has been paid to estimating the
demand for money, less effort has been devoted to estimating the demand for

other assets (primarily because of lack of data). An assumption frequently made
in some macroeconomic literature is that households exhibit constant relative

risk aversion. This implies unit wealth elasticities of demand. We test this
hypothesis below. A change in wealth alters both the number of households that
own an asset and the demand for the asset conditional upon ownership. We shall

estimate wealth elasticities at both the intensive and extensive margins. We

shall also estimate an aggregate elasticity for the household sector as a whole,
and

test the hypothesis that the impact of a change in wealth depends upon how

that change is distributed among households. Because the financial structure of

—3-.

the private sector's net worth is an important determinant of real decisions,
sich as corporate investment, the macroeconomic consequences of a change in

total household net worth will depend upon the magnitude of the wealth elastici-

ties of demand for different assets. Although our results are based on micro—
data, they have macroeconomic implications.
In section 2, we describe the pattern of household portfolio composition

that emerges from the survey and present some summary statistics. In section 3,

we

derive

a specification for the portfolio decision and discuss an appropriate

procedure. The estimation and results are described in section 4.
Estimates of the effects of taxes on portfolio composition are presented in section 5 and the wealth elasticities in section 6.

Portfolio Composition of the Sample
Our data are taken from the 1978 Survey of Consumer Financial Decisions

conducted by SRI International.

The survey is a stratified random sample of

6,010 U.S. households. It includes detailed information on household
characteristics, such as age,

education,

region and area of residence, marital

status and family composition, occupation, race, arid housing. It also includes
information on family income as well as portfolio composition and net worth.
The asset data refer to market values in May and June 1978 and the income data

to the calendar year 1977. The survey heavily oversampled high income families
and therefore provides a rich source of information on household portfolio
behavior.l No fewer than 2,1430 households (140.14 percent of the sample) reported

net worth in excess of $100,000 in 1978. The sample contains 2014 millionaires
and the largest value of reported net worth is $73 million.

_14_.

The survey is remarkable for the information it provides on the asset

holdings of each of the 6,010 households. The dollar holdings of over one
hundred different specific assets and liabilities were recorded for each

household. These were grouped by SRI into 23 different assets and 13 types of

liability. Table 1 shows these 36 categories. They include different types of
bank and savings account, money market funds, bonds of various types, stocks,
mutual funds, convertible securities, owner—occupied housing, real estate and

other tangibles, IRA—Keogh accounts, tax shelters and life insurance.2 For
purposes of estimation, we have grouped these thirty—six categories into eleven

aggregate asset and liability classifications. These are shown as the main
headings in Table 1. The survey data exclude social security and certain types
of private pension wealth, ordinary consumer durables, and the expected value of

future inheritances.3 Table 1 also shows the percentage of the total net worth
of the sample that is held in each of the assets. Most of the wealth of
households is held in the form of homes, stocks, and investment real estate.
The implausibly low percentage accounted for by home mortgages is due to a high
degree of non—reporting ——

close

to fifty percent ——

of

the value of first

mortgages on primary residences. This is analyzed further below.
Table 2 presents summary
households

statistics

on the portfolio composition of

in the sample. The mean level of net worth in 1978 was almost a

quarter of a million dollars. This oversampling of the rich is a great
advantage for the analysis of portfolio composition. Not surprisingly, certain
assets

are held by households with above average wealth levels, notably

corporate equity, bonds and "other assets" (tax shelters, etc.). Of the 6,oio

—5—

households only 593 owned manicipal bonds but the mean net worth of this

group was almost a million dollars. The SRI survey is particularly well
suited to a study of the effects of taxes on household portfolio behavior. It
provides a detailed account of the sources of income in each household and of

tax—deductible expenses. Twenty—two sources of income and twenty—one types of
expense are distinguished. This information, combined with the demographic
data provided for each household and the specific information on the household's
tax filing status, made it possible to derive accurate estimates of the marginal

tax rates faced by each household. We computed these tax rates using the TAXSIM
program developed at the National Bureau of Economic Research, which generated
tax liabilities for each household using both the federal and state tax code

relevant for the appropriate tax year. The information available to construct
marginal tax rates is, to our knowledge, more detailed than that used in any
previous study of the incentive effects of taxation.
It is clear from rows 1 and 2 of Table 2 that most households owned

incomplete portfolios. In only two cases, checking accounts and liquid savings,
was an asset held by more than 90 percent of the sample. At the other extreme
the proportions of the sample owning rminicipal bonds and taxable bonds were 9.9

and 10.5 percent respectively. Almost one—half of the sample owned corporate
equity and 81 percent were home—owners. In fact, for the complete classification
no household held more than 23 out of the possible 36 assets and liabilities,

and for the aggregated classification only O households held a complete
portfolio with all eleven assets and liabilities. The modal number of assets
owned was eight for the complete classification and seven for the aggregated

—6—

classification,

accounting for 12.0 and 19.6 percent of the sample respectively.

The median number owned was eight and six for the two classifications. Given
that the mean net worth of the sample was almost a quarter of a million dollars,
it

is surprising that the number of assets held was so small. It

is important,

therefore,

to take into account the phenomenon of incomplete ownership when

estimating

the demand for individual assets; this problem is the focus of

section 3.
The survey provides
independent

dollar

indicators of ownership for each asset that are

of the dollar holdings reported. Some households do not report

values for every asset they own and the existence of independent

responses indicating ownership and dollar holdings enables us to measure the

extent of this non—reporting (although not, of course, under—reporting). The
additional information allows us to obtain more efficient estimates by

exploiting techniques to deal with the problem of missing data. Of the 6,010
households, 2,048 provided a complete set of dollar values or the assets that
they owned. In section )4 we describe how data for both the sample of 2,048
households with complete responses and the full sample of 6,010 households may

be used in estimation. Although SRI used the ownership indicators to impute
values in cases of non—reporting, we were able to separate out the imputed

values and used only the raw

our

analysis.
To test the quality

population

actually reported by the survey respondents in

of the survey data, we compared the estimated

holdings for each asset (constructed by

using the grossing—up factors

in footnote 1) with the estimated aggregates shown in the year—end

—7—

balance sheets published by the Federal Reserve. The comparison is of necessity
inexact. The two sources use different classifications of assets and refer to
different dates in the year. Moreover, the FRB estimates for the household
sector are a residual in the balance sheet calculations. it was possible to make
a direct comparison for seven of our eleven categories of asset and liability,

and an approximate compaisoñ for the remaining assets. For most of the assets
the survey population totals are quite close to the FRB figures. The largest
discrepancies were for taxable bonds and "other assets" where the survev data
were only one—half and two—thirds of the balance sheet totals

respectively,5

Overall, it seems reasonable to conclude from these comparisons that the

survey

data

used here are worthy of study.

We turn now to the specification and estimation of a model of household

portfolio

3.

A

composition that allows for incomplete portfolios.

Model of Incomplete Portfolios

It is clear from the
the

survey data that most households own only a subset of

possible array of assets that they could hold, It is therefore necessary

to model both the probability of ownership of each asset and the demand for the
asset conditional upon ownership. The problems created by incomplete ownership
are twofold. First, the existence of zero holdings for some assets will have
"spillover" effects on the demand for the remaining assets. Conditional upon
the values of observable characteristics, the demand for an asset will depend
upon the particular combination of other assets in the portfolio, Second, there
is the more familiar problem that estimates based on observations with positive

—8—

of the asset are subject to sample selection bias. Previous empirical

holdings

studies of household portfolio behavior have not tackled these problems,

especially the first, satisfactorily. Ignoring such problems results in a
misspecification of the model and biased estimates of the parameters of
interest.

Previous theoretical discussions of incomplete portfolios have not analyzed
the Joint discrete and continuous choice of which combinations to own and, conditional

upon ownership, what fraction of net worth to invest in each asset.

Brennan (1975) and Goldsmith (1976) both analyze the optimal number of securi-

ties in

a portfolio (taken to be a continuous variable) in the presence of tran-

sactions costs. Optimal asset demands for a given combination have been
examined by Levy (1978) and Mayshar (1981). Only Mayshar (1979) examines the
choice of which assets to own.

There are several reasons for the existence of incomplete portfoLios. Two
of the most important are the following. First, the existence of transactions
costs, interpreted broadly to include the "holding costs" in both money and time
of monitoring and managing a portfolio, means that the optimal portfolio may

contain only a small number of assets. Second, it is possible that the
optimal portfolio may imply negative holdings of certain assets, and these may
be infeasible because of constraints on short sales (Auerbach and King 1983).
To prevent tax arbitrage, the revenue authorities adopt rules, such as the
asymmetric treatment of gains and losses and of interest receipts and interest

payments, that lead to nonlinear budget constraints. These constraints may be
very

similar

in practice to non—negativity constraints on asset holdings. In

—9—

other instances it may be very difficult or impossible to hold certain assets,
such as checking accounts, pension rights and housing, in negative quantities.

We shall therefore examine the optimal portfolio of a household with both
positive holding costs for each asset and non—negativity constraints on asset

holdings 6
The specification we derive involves estimating equations both for the
probability of ownership of an asset and

also

for its demand conditional upon

constraints on holdings of individual assets, then the demand system is a
switching regressions model with as many regimes as there are distinct
combinations

of assets that may be owned. It is important

to note that the

extension of the univariate Tobit model to the multivariate case does not
represent the behavior of an individual investor optimizing subject to holding
costs or non—negativity constraints. This is demonstrated below.T The way in

U is assumed to be a strictly concave function of a single consumption good, C,

and time (or age), denoted by t. T is either the investor's maximum life span
(uncertainty about date of death may be incorporated in the time—dependency

of U) or a longer planning horizon which allows for a bequest motive. The two
constraints are the initial condition for wealth and the budget constraint.

c(t) is the consumption flow at time (t).

The budget constraint given by (3.3) embodies two strong assumptions.
First, the only source of uncertainty is assumed to be that concerning returns on

the J risky assets. Second, investors are assumed to be able to trade
continuously with no costs of buying or selling securities.8
1±' one further assumption is added, namely that asset prices follow a

continuous time Markov process and do not exhibit jumps, then investors choose
their current portfolio to maximize V subject to equations (3.2) and (3.3) as if
they were optimizing over the mean and variance of the portfolio given the level

of current wealth (Merton 1971, 1973, 1982). The stochastic process generating
asset prices is not required to be stationary, but it must change in a way that

—11—

is either random or time—dependent in a nonstochastic manner.9 With this
assumption on the way in which exogenous shocks affect asset returns, we may
analyze portfolio decisions as if investors maximized the following function

Maximizing (3.4) subject to (3.5) and (3.8) yields a set of first—order
conditions together with the complementary slackness conditions corresponding

to the non—negativity constraints.-° Once it is known which assets are owned in
positive amounts in the optimal portfolio then the first—order conditions can be

inverted to yield a conditional asset demand system.11 The values of asset
demands conditional upon the combination of assets that is owned is given by

of the covariance matrix C, Th is a diagonal matrix with i/(i—t) as the

Equation (3.16) gives asset demands conditional upon ownership. To
determine which combination of assets a household owns it is not sufficient to

examine the first—order conditions. Rather, the levels of utility corresponding

—15—

to each combination must be compared. This means that the household faces a
discrete choice problem with as many alternatives as there are distinct
combinations

of assets, which (ignoring the null portfolio) is 2i. For

combination k, define the maximum level of utility (as a function of wealth, the
distribution of asset returns and other household characteristics) that can be
attained with that combination of assets as

The conditional demands that characterize the optimum at

The probability that combination k characterizes the optimum portfolio is thus

Pr(k) =

The structure of portfolios varies across households because of differences

in observable and unobservable household characteristics. The observables
include the tax rate, wealth and other socioeconomic characteristics recorded in

the survey. The unobservables include the differences in risk aversion captured

by h and differences in beliefs about the distribution of asset returns. In
this nxdel taxes and heterogeneous expectations play a crucial role in producing

incomplete portfolios. With homogeneous beliefs about the distribution of asset
returns and in the absence of taxes, the constraints on short sales would never

be binding. The separation theorem implies that with a riskiess asset the two
mutual funds that span the set of available returns are the riskiess asset

itself and a risky portfolio. All investors own the same risky portfolio and

—16—

this can be chosen to be the market portfolio. By construction it
amounts of the risky assets. A portfolio optimum is characterized

has positive
by

non—negative holdings of the two mutual funds, and so no investor would wish to

sell short any of the risky assets.15 In the presence of taxes or of
heterogeneity in beliefs about the distribution of asset returns, investors
will no longer wish to hold the same risky portfolio, and there will be

opportunities for trade to exploit differences in tax rates (or beliefs).1G At
the optimum some investors may wish to engage in short sales. With constraints
on short sales the result will be that some, or more likely many, investors will

hold incomplete portfolios. Another factor leading to incomplete portfolios is
holding costs, and we analyze these below.
To model the household's discrete choice among the

mutually

exclusive alternative portfolios would involve estimating the joint distribution
of the unobservables (differences in (i) risk aversion, (ii) beliefs about the
distribution of asset returns and (iii) holding costs), and would be
computationally infeasible given the number of alternatives and assets examined

here. We shall, therefore, estimate reduced form equations for the probability
of owning a particular combination of assets, and also for the probability of

owning a given asset j. The latter probability is given by

Pr(own j) =

ki Ck(1c)

(3.19)

We assume that the probabilities in (3.18) and (3.19) can be described as
if they were generated by a probit model, but we provide no rigorous
justification for the implied assumption of normally distributed errors.
Estimates of probit models for (3.18) and (3.19) are described in Section 4.

—11-.

One strong restriction implied by the model in (3.16) is that

, the

coefficient vector of household characteristics, is the same in all asset demand

equations. This implies that the wealth elasticities of conditional demands are
the same for all risky assets. As we shall see in Section 6, the null
hypothesis that wealth elasticities are the same for all assets is rejected by
the data.

To generalize the model we relax two of the assumptions made above. The

first is the existence of a riskiess asset.1T When all assets are risky, the
wealth elasticities of conditional demands vary across assets. This is because

the

separation theorem now implies that the two imxtual

funds that span the set

returns both consist of particular combinations of risky assets. We shall
regard (3.16) with replaced by . as a linear approximation to the underlying
of

demands i8
The second assumption is that of zero holding costs of monitoring and
managing a portfolio. We can incorporate holding costs in the model in a

limited fashion. Suppose that such costs comprise two components: a fixed
cost that is independent of the size of the holding and a variable cost propor-

tional to the amount owned. As far as the variable costs are concerned, the
first—order conditions and the demand system (3.9) are unchanged with the

single exception that

is now equal to (l—t)(1+c)/(i—t), where c is

the variable holding cost per dollar for asset j. Assuming that investors face
the same cost schedule the influence of the holding costs is absorbed into the

coefficients of the ownership combination dumnr variables in (3.16). The fixed
costs have no effect on the conditional demand system, but both types of cost

—18—

influence the decision as to which assets will appear in the optimal portfolio

and affect the coefficients of the reduced form probit models (3.18) and (3.19).
The existence of holding costs can, therefore, also lead to incomplete port-

folios with the conditional demand system given by (3.16). Transactions costs
of the more conventional kind defined over trades rather than the size of

holdings are equivalent to holding costs in a one—period model. In a continuous
time model, however, trading costs lead to infrequent revisions of the portfolio
and thus undermine the equivalence of the mean—variance model and the life—cycle
model with continuous trading.

ii.

Econometric Estimation and Results
With either non—negativity constraints or holding costs of the type

analyzed above, the asset demand system conditional upon ownership is given by a
switching regressions model with as many regimes as there are distinct

combinations of assets. The way in which the demand system changes according to
the regime represents the "spillover" effects of the absence of certain assets

in the optimal portfolio on the demands for those assets that do appear. It
would be impossible to estimate separate functional forms for each regime

because with 2i regimes even a large data set such as that used here does
not provide adequate degrees of freedom. To derive a model for which estimation
is feasible we have tried to exploit the economic structure of the consumer's

programming problem. This led to a specification in which the shift in
functional form across regimes was rather straightforward in that only the

intercept varied with regime. The choice of the optimal combination of assets

—19—

is made by a comparison of the utility levels associated with the

discrete alternative combinations. Empirically we shall ndel this choice by
estimating reduced form probits for the probability of owning particular
combinations of assets,19
Several problems arise in the estimation of the demand system (3.16).
First, since the demand equation for each asset is estimated using observations
on only those households with

positive

holdings of the asset, there is potential

sample selection bias. To correct for this, we use a standard two—stage procedure to yield consistent estimates. We first estimate reduced form probit
equations for the ownership probabilities of each asset and then include the
estimated hazard as an additional regressor in the demand system (Heckman 1976,

1979).20
Second, only a subset of

the

the full sample, namely 2,0148

households, reported

value of holdings for each asset which they owned. Provided nonreporting is

either

random or, more generally, "ignorable" (Griliches 1981), then estimation

on the sample of 2,018 households yields consistent estimates. Nonreporting is
"ignorable"

if it is a function of the explanatory variables in (3.16) but riot

of the error term u. More efficient estimates can, however, be obtained by

using the information contained in the remaining observations. Nonreporting of
dollar values leads to the problem that reported wealth understates true net
worth if values of assets are not reported, and overstates it if liabilities are

an important explanatory variable in the ide1, and
to test the hypothesis that risk aversion, as given by (3.13), is a

not reported. Net worth is

we wish

function

of net

worth. Hence we

must

allow for the effect of nonreporting in

—20—

estimation. One approach would be to treat all instances of nonreporting as
missing observations on net worth and use existing nthods for dealing with
missing data (Dagenais 1973, Gourieroux and Monfort 1981, and Conniffe 1983).
This would, however, be very inefficient because nonreporting is usually of the
form where a household fails to report values for only one or two of its assets,
and reported net worth contains valuable information on holdings of other assets

which could be used in estimation. The values of net worth are incomplete
rather than missing. In the appendix therefore we describe a two—step methodS
for dealing with the problem of nonreporting and which exploits the information
contained in recorded net worth.

Third, because of the differential tax treatment of assets, the marginal

tax rate is endogenous to the choice of portfolio. Under a nonlinear tax schedule, such as that in the U.S., a household's marginal tax rate depends upon the

composition of its portfolio. For example, a household can lower its marginal
tax rate for a given level of net worth by investing in rainicipal bonds rather

than taxable bonds. To deal with this we estimate (3.16) by instrumental

variables. FI estimation is infeasible here because of the number of dirnen—
sions (eleven assets) over which the nonlinear budget set is defined. We calculate the marginal tax rate that each household would face at an exogenously
given hypothetical portfolio using the actual nonlinear tax schedule applicable

to the household. With this constructed tax rate as an instrument for the
actual marginal tax rate consistent estimates of the parameter vector nay be

obtained.21 To construct the exogenous portfolio we have assumed that households
hold all of their wealth in short-term government securities (3—month Treasury
Bills), the return on which is taxed as ordinary income.22

Fourth, the theoretical specification
consists of a sum of dunmtr

implies that the intercept in (3.16)

variables, each one corresponding to the ownership of

a particular combination of assets other than that in the dependent variable.
In principle the required number of duxnnr variables is 2J—l•1 (J is the nwnber
of assets), which for J = 11 is equal to 1,023. It would
clearly be infeasible
to estimate a demand system with

that number of durnnr variables in each

equation. Moreover, some combinations are not held by any household in the
sample, and hence some of the duinnr variables

would be prfectly collinear. We

have, therefore, aggregated the assets into four groups for the purpose of
defining the ownership dunmr variables in (3.16).
checking accounts and liquid savings, (2)

The four groups are (1)

equity, municipal bonds, taxable bonds

and other assets, (3) homes, contractual and less liquid savings, and ()
home

mortgages and other liabilities. The criterion for selecting the groups was
that the correlation coefficient between

the ownership dummies of any pair of

assets within a group be greater than 0.75 and that between any pair of assets
in different groups be less than 0.75.
mine both the number and composition of

This criterion was sufficient to deterour aggregate groups with one exception.

Membership of contractual savings schemes was more highly correlated with posi-

tive holdings of liabilities than with holdings of assets, but we chose on a
priori grounds to group contractual savings with homes and less liquid savings
(which had correlation coefficients of 0.5k and 0.50 with membership of contrac-

tual savings schemes). Grouping assets in this way means that in each of the
eleven

conditional demand equations there are a n.ximum of seven ownership dumnr
variables. In cases where the number of households owning a particular corn—

—22—

bination was very small (well below 1 percent of the sample) the dummy
corresponding to that combination was omitted to avoid problems of collinearity.
The ownership dummies used in each equation are shown in Table 14,

Fifth, the ownership combination dummy variables in (3.16) are endogenous.
The optimal portfolio choice determines both the combination of assets

that

are

owned and the demands conditional upon ownership. Hence the dummy variables
that enter into (3.16) are endogenous. Several estimation methods can be used
to obtain consistent estimates in the presence of endogenous dummy variables
(Heckman 1978, Dubin and McFadden 19814). We use the reduced form method in
which probit models are estimated for each ownership combination and then ordinary least squares is applied to (3.16) with predicted probabilities replacing

the ownership combination dummies. Coefficient estimates of the asset demand
equations and heteroskedastic—consistent standard errors are shown in Table 14.

The estimated reduced—form probit equations are shown in Table 3 and the
estimated asset demand equations in Table 4.

The explanatory variables in the

probit equations include terms in total net worth, current employment income,
the marginal tax rate, the age of the head of household, marital status, occupation, education, employment status, and the subjective perception of aversion to

risk. The explanatory variables in the demand equations include all of these
variables plus the relevant set of dummy variables corresponding to the

ownership of different combinations of assets. Because the dependent variable
in the demand equations is the logarithm of the asset share, the adding up

constraint is not imposed on the model. One equation may therefore be regarded
as redundant.

—23—

We focus on the estimated tax and wealth effects in sections 5 and 6, and

summarize briefly here the results for the other explanatory variables. Income
from employment has (as predicted by the model in which net worth is the relevant variable) little effect on asset ownership or demands except for homes and

home

mortgages

where the consumption services provided are likely to be corre-

lated with employment income. Age is an important determinant of ownership.
The results in Table 1 reveal a pronounced quadratic relationship.23

In the con-

ditional demand equations age effects are significant only for the first four

assets, where a quadratic relationship is again evident. The most significant

effect of marriage appears to be on the size of checking accounts. The effects
of occupation and, in particular, education suggest that information Costs may

be an important determinant of portfolio behavior. Both occupation and education significantly affect the probability of owning

corporate

equities, taxable

bonds, rminicipal bonds, and "other assets," the four asset Categories for which

we would expect information costs to be highest. Consistent with this explanation is the finding that neither education nor occupation play a significant

role in the conditional demand equations. Being employed has a positive effect
on the probability of awning most assets (except for equity and bonds). It
appears, however, to have no effect on the level of conditional demands. Risk
averse households are more likely both to own and to invest a higher proportion

of net worth in contractual savings and taxable bonds. They invest correspon—
dingly less in the more unusual and risky assets that are included in the
"other" assets and liabilities categories.

The coefficients on the ownership combination dummies would generally be
expected to be negative, either because the assets are substitutes or because

214
the greater the number of assets in the portfolio the smaller is likely to be

the share of any one asset. Positive coefficients would arise when assets were
complements. Of the fifteen ownership combination coefficients that are signi—
ficant at the 5 percent level, eleven are negative and four are positive. In
the cases of positive coefficients the results suggest compleinentarily between

less liquid assets and ownership group 2 (equity and bonds), contractual savings

and group

5.

(liabilities),

and between homes and group 2.

Effects of Taxes on Portfolio Composition
The way in which taxes affect portfolio choices has been at the center of

the recent debates about the merits of fundamental reform of the tax system.

A

switch to either a comprehensive income tax or a consumption tax would eliminate
the differential tax treatment of assets and consequent distortions associated

with the current system. Very little empirical evidence has been brought to
bear on this issue. The SRI survey is well suited to an examination of the
problem because of the very

detailed

information on the components of taxable

incomes and deductions recorded for each household (see section 2 above).
In Table 5 are shown the marginal tax rates for those households owning

each of our eleven categories of assets and liabilities. We show both the
unweighted average for holders of each asset, and also the average marginal tax
rate weighted by households' shares of the total holdings in the sample. Not
surprisingly, the weighted average marginal tax rates are higher than the

unweighted means. For the sample as a whole the unweighted average marginal tax
rate is 2T.l percent in 1977 and the weighted (by shares of net worth) average

—25—

marginal tax rate is L2.7 percent. There are larger differences in marginal tax
rate among the holders of different types of asset. These are particularly pronounced for the weighted averages. For checking accounts, liquid and less
liquid savings, owner—occupied housing and home mortgages, the marginal tax
rates are noticeably less than the weighted average marginal tax rate for the

whole sample. The two highest marginal tax rates are for holders of municipal
bonds (which are tax—exempt) and corporate equity, where the weighted averages
are 50.5 and 119.9 percent respectively.

There are two ways in which taxes affect portfolio composition. The first
is that differences in effective tax rates among assets and households may lead
to portfolio specialization in order that households can exploit their comparative advantage in the production of post-tax income streams (Auerbach and

King 1983). Households with lower marginal tax rates will hold more of the
taxed securities, such as liquid and less liquid savings, and those facing

higher marginal tax rates will hold nre of the tax—privileged securities, such

as municipal bonds and equity. The second effect is that taxes alter the trade—
off between risk and return. The impact of this on the demands for risky assets
is theoretically ambiguous (see Feldstein 1976 for a survey of the literature).
The evidence from Table 5 bears out the predictions of the theory of com-

parative advantage. But this is not the whole story. Taxable bonds, for
instance, are owned by households with very high marginal tax rates which
contradicts the pure comparative advantage model. Moreover, Tables 3 and J4 show

rather mixed results. The ownership probabilities are generally positively
related to the tax rate which suggests that taxes increase the demand for risky

—26—

assets. But in Table

the tax rate coefficients are insignificantly different

from zero in most cases.

One potential difficulty with the estimated tax coefficients is the identification problem associated with including both the tax rate and current income

as explanatory variables. The tax rate is a known nonlinear transformation of
income and other exogenous variables, and if the way in which income enters into
the true behavioral model is unknown the separate effects of the tax rate
cannot be identified. This problem is likely to be less irnportant for our data
set than in many other cases because (a) we include employment income not

taxable income in the model, and (b) we are able to construct accurate estimates

of taxable income. The correlation coefficient between the marginal tax rate
and employment income was only 0.53,

and that between the tax rate and the

logarithm of net worth was 0.37. Moreover, it is wealth rather than current
income that should be the forcing variable behind portfolio allocation, and so
the potential identification problem is unlikely to be serious.

It appears that tax rates are more important in determining the probability
of

It

ownership of an asset than its share in net worth conditional upon ownership.
is perhaps surprising that our econometric estimates do not corroborate the

clientele

effects apparent from Table 5. The failure of our estimation proce-

dure, using a seemingly accurate measure of the marginal tax rate, to identify
more pronounced tax effects suggests, contrary to raich of the recent literature,

that taxes donot play a decisive role in explaining the differences in portfolio composition across households.

—27—

Wealth Elasticities
The model estimated above allows us to calculate the wealth elasticities of

demand for each asset, at both the intensive and extensive margins, as a

function of the estimated coefficients and values of the exogenous 'v.riables. A

change in wealth has two effects. First, it alters the probability that a
household owns an asset. Secondly, conditional upon ownership it changes the
demand for each asset. The expected demand for an asset is the product of the

ownership probability, ¶ and the conditional demand, e,, and we define the
J

total wealth elasticity as the elasticity of the expected demand with respect to

wealth. This is given by (dropping household superscripts)

d(ire)
=

E

(6.1)

This expression may be written as the sum of the intensive and extensive
elasticities

where f( ) is the standard normal density, Z is the vector of values of the

(6.7)

This expression shows that the estimated model allows a reasonably flexible

specification for the wealth elasticities. They depend upon the level of wealth
itself both directly (though the linear dependence on in w) and indirectly

through the value of the hazard h. Household characteristics other than wealth
enter via their influence on the hazard. Because the hazard appears in (6.7),
the wealth elasticity is a nonlinear function of the estimated parameters. If
all four of the wealth coefficients are zero then the wealth elasticity is

unity. This is useful because a natural null hypothesis to test is that the
wealth elasticity is equal to unity. If household preference orderings exhibit
constant relative risk aversion then the wealth elasticities of all assets will

—29—

equal to unity. It is clear, however, that the hypothesis of constant relative risk aversion is strongly rejected by the data, contrary to the findings of
four of the
Blume and Friend (1975). Only in the case of taxable bonds are all

be

estimated

wealth coefficients insignificantly different from zero at the 1 per-

cent level. One caveat to this conclusion is that neither we nor Blume and
Friend included social security wealth in the measure of net worth. Given the
high wealth levels of our sample this may not be of great importance.

An addi

tional caveat is that we ignore the possibility that households see through the
"institutional veil," and condition their portfolios on the assets in which

their defined contribution pension plans and IRA/Keogh accounts are invested.
For the conditional demand equations Table 6 shows the value of the chi—
square statistic to test the null hypothesis that the coefficients on both
wealth

terms are zero. The

critical values of chi—square with two degrees of

freedom are 5.1 at the 5 percent

hypothesis

level and 9.21 at the 1 percent level. The

of constant relative risk aversion can be rejected for all assets

except equity and bonds at the 1 percent level.25
Table 7 presents point estimates of the ownership,

demand, and total wealth

elasticities for each asset evaluated for two representative households. The
first is a household with wealth equal to the estimated population mean net
worth of $57,14O8, and the second is one with wealth equal to the sample mean net

worth of $223,188.26 In both cases the households are assumed to have values of
other household characteristics equal to the sample mean. The ownership elasticities are small for most assets but for corporate equity, taxable bonds, mini—
cipal bonds and other assets, an increase in wealth has a sizeable positive

—30—

impact on the probability of ownership. In

Figure

1 we plot the predicted

ownership probabilities as a function of wealth implied by the probit estimates

reported in

Table 3. The probabilities are evaluated at sample means for all

household characteristics other than wealth. The plots show clearly that the
relationship between ownership and wealth differs across assets. Of particular
interest are the sigmoid—shaped curves for equity and "other assets."

The demand elasticities also vary significantly across assets. At the
sample mean level of net worth the demand elasticities for equity and municipal

bonds are very close to unity. For checking accounts (a large component of
money demand) and liquid savings the elasticities are around one—half, in
contrast to the presumption in much of the macroeconomic literature that they

are close to zero. The elasticity for contractual savings is also

around

one—

half and that for housing about one—third. The only negative elasticity is that
for taxable bonds and here none of the estimated wealth coefficients were signi-

ficantly different from zero. At the opposite end of the spectrum, the largest
total elasticities are for municipal bonds, corporate equity and other assets,
and at the sample mean value for net worth all three exceed unity.

For both types of liability the elasticities are less than unity. From
this and the balance sheet constraint that net worth equals assets minus liabilities we may deduce that the wealth elasticity of the nine assets taken as a

group is less than unity. Both assets and liabilities are measured as positive
amounts. Let A denote total assets, L denotes total liabilities, EA and

the

wealth elasticities of assets and liabilities (averages of the individual asset
and liability elasticities weighted by the shares of each asset (liability) in

total assets (liabilities)). Then the condition that W = A - L implies that

Since 0

1.

It is not surprising, therefore, that for most of

the assets the elasticities in Table 7 are less than unity.21
Because the magnitude of the wealth elasticities depends upon wealth and
other household characteristics, the aggregate effect of a change in wealth

depends upon how that change is distributed among the population. Table 7 shows
that the elasticities are different for households with different levels of net

worth.28 In Table 8 we show the aggregate wealth elasticity for each asset under
the assumption that the proportionate change in wealth is uniform among the

sample. The predicted aggregate demand for asset j is

The first three columns of

Table 8 show the aggregate ownership, demand and total elasticities for the full

sample of households with positive net worth. For those households which did
not report the dollar values of all asset holdings, the predicted level of net
worth (as described in the discussion of missing data in Section 1) was used to
calculate the elasticities.

The broad pattern of elasticities shown in Table 7 holds also for the

aggregate elasticities in Table 8. Taking into account the variation in wealth

and other

characteristics among the sample leads to somewhat larger elasticities

for equity, "other assets," and liabilities other than mortgages. Because the
sample is drawn heavily from upper-income groups, we calculate also aggregate
elasticities for the population as a whole where the individual elasticities are

weighted not only by predicted asset shares but also by population weights. The

estimates of the aggregate elasticities are displayed in the final
three columns of Table 8. These are our best estimates of the elasticities
population

relevant for macroeconomic behavior. The largest elasticity is for municipal
bonds, followed by equity and other assets. The smallest elasticities are for
owner—occupied housing, home mortgages and less liquid savings.

Conclusions
Examining the pattern of household portfolio composition that emerges from

a new survey of 6,010 U.S. households, we have found that the vast majority of

households hold only a subset of the available assets. This has implications
for both the theoretical modelling of portfolio behavior and the econometric
estimation of asset demand equations that have not been dealt with satisfac-

torily in earlier studies. We have shown that if the incomplete portfolios are
the result of an optimization subject to holding costs and constraints on short
sales

then the asset demand system is a switching regressions model with as many

regimes as there are distinct possible portfolios. The specification we derived
involved equations both for the probability of owning each asset
of

and combination

assets and for the asset demand system conditional upon ownership. An esti-

mation procedure was developed to respond to the problems caused by incomplete

—33—

portfolios, non—reporting of dollar holdings, and the endogeneity of the tax
rate and of the portfolio composition dummies.

We have used this model to examine the impact of taxes on portfolio com-

position. The information provided by the survey on taxable incomes and deductions has enabled us to calculate the marginal tax rate facing each household.

Our

results show that tax rates are a significant determinant of asset ownership

but, surprisingly, not of the share of net worth invested in the asset. Though
far from conclusive, this finding suggests that the magnitude of the distortion
induced

by capital taxation on household portfolio choices may be less than pre-

viously thought.

We

have estimated wealth elasticities of demand for a range of assets and

liabilities at both the intensive and

extensive margins. The presumption that

the wealth elasticity of demand for money

unity

is zero and that for other assets is

was shown to be unjustified. For corporate equity, municipal bonds and

"other assets," the estimated wealth elasticities were greater than unity.
Other assets, such as wealth in contractual savings schemes and short—term

financial assets, had elasticities of around one—half. These estimates suggest
that changes in total household net worth will change the structure of household
balance sheets and consequently affect real decisions, such as corporate invest—
ment, in the economy.
Finally, this study suggests that the differences in portfolio composition
across households cannot be fully explained within the framework of the conven-

tional portfolio choice model. The households in our sample, though wealthy,
own a surprisingly small number of assets and liabilities and this lack of

diversification was found to be important when estimating asset demand

equations. Given that the mean net worth of the sample was almost a quarter of

million dollars in 1978, it is bard, to imagine that transactions costs, as
traditionally defined, played a decisive role in producing incomplete porta

folios.

One alternative explanation is that some assets produce joint products.
For example, housing produces both a stream of returns on the investment and a

consumption flow of housing services. Other assets may be held as part of a
labor contract, either on the part of senior managers or in own businesses, in
which case the desire to diversify portfolio risks may be constrained by

contracts that preserve incentives for managers. Still others may offer
liquidity, as in the case of checking accounts or liquid savings, or insurance,

as in the case of contractual savings. The joint nature of the services provided by some assets means that the separation of the optimal consumption plan

and the optimal portfolio allocation no longer holds. Differences in consumption patterns across households could therefore lead to incomplete portfolios.
A second and more compelling explanation of this phenomenon is the
existence of significant holding costs in the management of a portfolio that

increase with the number of assets owned. In particular, our results suggest
that a major factor affecting household portfolio behavior may be the costs of
acquiring and processing the information required to make decisions about how

best to allocate resources across different assets. We would expect such costs
to vary among households and, in particular, with observable variables such as

the level of educational attainment and occupation. Our results show that edu—

—35—

cation and occupation are important

determinants of the ownership decision for

process and costs of acquiring information.

Appendix

We describe here a two—step procedure for dealing with the problem of
nonreportirig of asset values. At the first stage we estimate an equation for
the logarithm of net worth as a function of exogenous and observable household
characteristics using data for the sample of 2048 households which report values
for all assets owned.

lnW=Xb+e
As

(A.l)

explanatory variables we include a piece—wise linear f'.inction of age

(using the method proposed in King and Dicks—Mireaux 1982), income from
employment, marital status, education, occupation, household composition,
religion, pension status, and a farm family dummy. The sample selection bias
induced by using only observations with positive values of net worth was

corrected by a standard two—step procedure (Heckman 1976, 19T9). The parameter
estimates, b, can be used to construct estimates of the logarithm of net worth
for

households with incomplete responses. In fact, if we stopped at this point

and

used Xb as an estimate of in w in (3.16) for nonreporting households, then

this

procedure would be equivalent to a Dageriais estimator for the missing data

problem (Dagenais 19T3). But because net worth is not missing but only
incompletely recorded we use a second step which improves efficiency.

We assume

that we nay approximate the relationship between recorded and true net worth
(denoted by WR and W, respectively) by

lnlnW-Ead.U

(A.2)

j=l j j

where

otherwise.

We obtain estimates of the coefficients a by regressing (in WR — Xb)
the nonreporting dummies using observations on households where the value
of at least one holding is not reported ((A.2) holds exactly for households

which report all holdings). Our estimate of net worth for households with
incomplete reporting is given by

condition is not satisfied instrumental variables estimation can be employed.
In the estimation of both the reduced form probits and the asset demand system

(3.16), we use predicted et worth as given by (A.3).

The sample has two parts. The "NFO" file consists of 3,801 households with

incomes of less than $30,000. The "Gallup" file consists of 2,206 households
with incomes of $30,000 or more.

Weighting

factors for each household are

provided on the tape that allow us to gross—up sample totals to provide
population estimates.
2.

The recorded data on the value of partnerships and unquoted businesses of

which

the household was the principal owner were imputed using sales figures.

Because of the arbitrary nature of the imputation we excluded "own business

value" from our analysis.
3.

Durables such as boats, planes, works of

art, etc. are included in the

"other assets".

For a description of TAXSIM see Feldstein and Frisch (1977) and Feenberg

and Rosen (1983).
5.

A detailed discussion of the comparison of the two sets of estimates for

personal sector asset holdings may be found in King and Leape (l98).
6.

A further reason might be the existence of a number of "mutual funds" (less

than the number of assets and liabilities distinguished in our survey) which in

themselves are sufficient for a portfolio optimum. Given the nature of the
eleven assets and liabilities used in this study (see Table 1) the existence of

such mutual funds is improbable. The number of funds that would be required
depends upon the stochastic process generating asset returns.
7.

For further discussion of this point see King (1981).

It is important to distinguish between transactions costs of trades and

"holding costs" of different assets. The

latter are discussed below; the former

we shall ignore.
9.

If preferences are restricted such that U belongs to the HARA

(hyperbolic

absolute risk aversion) class, then the one—period portfolio problem equivalence
result holds for a more general

nonstationary stochastic process (Merton 1911).

10. The second—order conditions will be satisfied if

is a concave function

of the equity holdings and a suitable constraint qualification holds.

11. This model and its relationship to the econometric literature on
inultivariate tobit and related models is discussed in more detail in King
(l981).

12. In the continuous time model underlying (3.14), A11 is equivalent to the

inverse of the degree of absolute risk aversion of the derived utility of wealth

function. This function is defined below in (3.11).
13. One exception is that the effective tax rate on equity, which depends upon
the treatment of capital gains, varies with the frequency of trading because the

tax is based on realizations. The trading frequency nay, in turn, be a function
of household characteristics.
i14. We ignore here the effect of the combination of assets owned on the coefficient of the tax rate in order to reduce the prDblems of collinearity
discussed in Section 14.

15. We assume that none of the risky assets are redundant in the sense that its
returns are a linear combination of the returns on other assets.

discussion of the effect of taxes on optimal

iT. Bodie (1982) has argued that short—term Treasury Bills are reasonably close
to a riskiess investment.

logarithmic transformation of' the dependent variable was made to reduce the

otherwise severe heteroskedasticity. The influence of the combination of assets
owned was limited to the constant term as in (3.16)

proportions

to redace to manageable

the number of coefficients to be estimated.

19. For a very small number of assets the likelihood function corresponding to
the Kuhn—Tucker conditions for the investor's programming problem can be
evaluated using approximations to the imiltivar.iate normal distribution (Wales

and Woodland, 1983). But for the number of assets which it is economically
interesting to examine this approach is infeasible.
20.

The theoretical model implies that the function of observable

characteristics

which determines

whether a household owns an asset is

not the

same as the function which describes demands conditional upon ownership. Hence
we

estimate a probit ownership model and demand system separately rather than a

tobit

model. Because we provide no rigorous justification for the probit speci-

fication, the assumption of joint normality of the errors in the ownership and
conditional demand equations mast be regarded as a maintained hypothesis.

21. The nonlinearity of the tax schedule means that the instrument is a
nonlinear function of the exogenous variables. In this case instrumental
variables estimation is not equivalent to two—stage least squares. For further
discussion of estimation with nonlinear budget constraints see Hausman (1981,
1982).

22. The interest rate was taken to be the mean of the quarterly rates for 1977
published in The Federal Reserve Bulletin, a figure of 5.27 percent per annum.

23. Life cycle aspects of portfolio composition are discussed further in King
and Leape (198k).

214. For the probit model where f( )

is

the standard normal density the hazard

is equal to the inverse of Mills' ratio.

25. We do not present a test statistic for the asset demand system as a whole
because the number of observations used in estimation varied across assets.

26. The population mean value of net worth was estimated using the sample
weights described in fn. 1.

27. Because we are using cross—section data, we are unable to distinguish bet—
veen permanent and transitory shocks to wealth which, in the presence of coriven—

tional transactions costs, would have different effects on asset demands.
Transactions costs are, however, unlikely to be of major importance for wealthy
households such as those in our

sample.

28. The condition that the aggregate wealth elasticity is independent of the
distribution of wealth is a

=

= 2j

=

0.

Only in the case of taxable

bonds would this null hypothesis fail to be rejected at the 1 percent level.
