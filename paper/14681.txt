Dynamics of the Gender Gap for Young Professionals in the Corporate and Financial Sectors
Marianne Bertrand, Claudia Goldin, and Lawrence F. Katz
NBER Working Paper No. 14681
January 2009, Revised September 2009
JEL No. J16,J24,J44
ABSTRACT
This paper assesses the relative importance of various explanations for the gender gap in career outcomes
for highly-educated workers in the U.S. corporate and financial sectors. The careers of MBAs, who
graduated between 1990 and 2006 from a top U.S. business school, are studied to understand how
career dynamics differ by gender. Although male and female MBAs have nearly identical (labor) incomes
at the outset of their careers, their earnings soon diverge, with the male annual earnings advantage
reaching almost 60 log points at ten to 16 years after MBA completion. We identify three proximate
reasons for the large and rising gender gap in earnings: differences in training prior to MBA graduation;
differences in career interruptions; and differences in weekly hours. These three determinants can
explain the bulk of gender differences in earnings across the years following MBA completion. The
presence of children is the main contributor to the lesser job experience, greater career discontinuity
and shorter work hours for female MBAs. Some MBA mothers, especially those with well-off spouses,
slow down in the labor market within a few years following their first birth. Disparities in the productive
characteristics of male and female MBAs are small, but the pecuniary penalties from shorter hours
and any job discontinuity are enormous for MBAs.

A. Introduction
Positions in the business and financial sectors have commanded exceptionally high
earnings in recent years and attracted extraordinary talent.1 Professionals in these sectors often
have a master’s in business administration (MBA) and the degree has grown in popularity among
graduates of the best universities and colleges. Among individuals with a BA from a selective
institution, those earning an MBA within ten years of graduation increased from 4.3 percent for
those finishing college in the early 1970s to 7.1 percent in the early 1990s.2 During the same
period, the share of MBAs among the graduates of selective undergraduate institutions earned by
females increased by more than a factor of three.3 The fraction female among all MBAs
increased from 1970 to 2006 by a factor of ten, rising from 4 percent to 43 percent.4
Despite the narrowing of the gender gap in business education, there is a growing sense
that women are not getting ahead fast enough in the corporate and financial world. Bertrand and
Hallock (2001) document the under-representation of women among the five highest paid
executives in Execucomp’s (S&P 1500) firms from 1992 to 1997. Only about 2.5 percent of the
executives in their sample are women, and the under-representation is especially severe at the
1

Among men who received their BAs from Harvard University around 1970, 5 percent had positions in
the financial sector 15 years later in 1985. But among those who graduated around 1990, fully 15 percent
worked in the financial sector in 2005. Considering both the corporate and financial sectors the change
was from 22.1 percent to 38.5 percent across the two graduating cohorts. The increase for women was
from 11.7 percent to 22.5 percent. The premium to working in the financial sector among Harvard
graduates was a whopping 195 percent and the premium in the corporate sector (executive and
management jobs) was 25 percent relative to the average of other occupations in 2005. See Goldin and
Katz (2008) on the Harvard data and Philippon and Reshef (2009), more generally, for an analysis of the
growth of the financial sector across the past century.
2
The 2003 National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG) is used to obtain the fraction of BAs
graduating from Research University I and Liberal Arts I colleges (Carnegie classifications) from 1970 to
1973 and from 1990 to 1993 who received an MBA within ten years of graduating. In this manner we
exclude those who obtained an MBA in mid-career through an executive MBA program and those who
obtained an MBA without having graduated from a U.S. university. By limiting the undergraduate
institutions to selective ones, we attempt to hold student quality constant over the two decades.
3
Using the NSCG and restricting the sample to BAs from selective universities and colleges gives 12.7
percent in 1970-73 and 39.5 percent in 1990-93 for the fraction female among those earning MBAs.
4
In fact, the fraction female among all graduating MBAs has exceeded 30 percent for each of the past 25
years (Source: U.S. Department of Education, NCES, Digest of Education Statistics, includes all masters
in business fields). The fraction has been lower in the top MBA programs. It exceeded 30 percent at
Harvard Business School starting around 2000 (HBS website) and has only just exceeded 30 percent at
the University of Chicago Booth School of Business (UC Booth administrative data).

highest levels of the corporate ladder. The number of female CEOs among Execucomp firms
increased from just four in 1992 to 34 in 2004, according to Wolfers (2006), but women still
represent only 1.3 percent of the CEO-year observations in his sample.
Various explanations have been proposed for women’s underperformance in the
corporate and financial sectors. Experimental evidence suggests that women have less taste for
the highly-competitive environments in top finance and corporate jobs (Niederle and Vesterlund
2007), and female MBAs may be less willing to aggressively negotiate for pay and promotion
(Babcock and Laschever 2003). MBA women may be subject to implicit or explicit gender
discrimination (Bertrand, Chugh, and Mullainathan 2005), and even talented female MBAs may
encounter difficulty getting recognized in male-dominated workplaces.5 Women may also fall
behind because of the career-family conflicts arising from the purportedly long hours, heavy
travel commitments and inflexible schedules of most high-powered finance and corporate jobs.
This paper speaks to the relative importance of these alternative explanations of the
gender gap in career outcomes for highly-educated personnel in the U.S. corporate and financial
sectors. We study the careers of MBAs who graduated between 1990 and 2006 from a top U.S.
business school—the Booth School of Business of the University of Chicago—and how career
dynamics differ by gender. We explore the evolution of the gender gap in earnings and labor
supply for young professionals employed primarily in corporate, consulting and financial
services jobs.
We find that at the outset of their careers male and female MBAs have nearly identical
labor incomes. Their earnings, however, soon diverge. The male annual earnings advantage
reaches 30 log points five years after MBA completion and almost 60 log points ten to 16 years
after MBA completion. The share of female MBAs not employed also rises substantially in the
decade following MBA completion with 13 percent of the women not working at all at nine
years after MBA completion as compared with 1 percent of the men.

5

See also Bell (2005), who finds that women-led firms (e.g., firms where the CEO or the chairman of the
board is a women) have a higher share of female executives in the other “top five paid” positions and
remunerate these female executives more than non-women led firms do.

12-August-09, Dynamics 2

Most interesting is why female MBAs have not done as well as their male peers. We
identify three proximate reasons for the large and rising gender gap in earnings that emerges
within a few years of MBA completion: differences in training prior to MBA graduation,
differences in career interruptions, and differences in weekly hours worked. These three
determinants can explain the bulk of the gender differences in earnings across the years
following MBA completion, but their relative importance changes with years since MBA
completion. We use our sample to explore this evolution by analyzing the gender gap by years
after the MBA and by comparing women without any career interruptions to men.
Male and female MBAs begin their careers with somewhat different training. Men take
more finance courses and have higher GPAs in business school. Gender differences in grades
and courses are not large but contribute to the earnings gap because of large labor market returns
to these components of MBA training. The large growth in the gender gap in earnings for MBAs
during their first 15 years out is mainly a consequence of gender differences in career
interruptions and weekly hours worked. Women have more career interruptions and work shorter
hours, including more work in part-time positions and self-employment. Although these
differences are modest, the remuneration disparity they entail is exceptionally large. The
relationship between income and time off is highly non-linear for those in our sample. Any
career interruption—a period of six months or more out of work—is costly in terms of future
earnings, and at ten years out women are 22 percentage points more likely than men to have had
at least one career interruption. Deviations from the male norm of high hours and continuous
labor market attachment are greatly penalized in the corporate and financial sectors.
The presence of children is the main contributor to the lesser job experience, greater
career discontinuity and shorter work hours for female MBAs. Across the first 15 years
following the MBA, women with children have about an eight month deficit in actual post-MBA
experience compared with the average man, while woman without children have a 1.5 month
deficit. Similarly women with children typically work 24 percent fewer weekly hours than the
average male; women without children work only 3.3 percent fewer hours. Women in our
sample with children are not negatively selected on predicted earnings; MBA mothers are, if
anything, positively selected on business school performance and earnings in the first few years
12-August-09, Dynamics 3

following MBA completion. By estimating panel data models with individual fixed-effects, we
can observe exactly when women with children shift into lower hours positions and leave the
labor force. The careers of MBA mothers slow down substantially within a few years following
their first birth. But almost no decline in labor force participation and only a modest decline in
hours worked are apparent in the two years before the first birth.
MBA mothers seem to actively choose jobs that are family friendly and avoid jobs with
long hours and greater career advancement possibilities. The dynamic impact of a first birth on
women’s labor market outcomes greatly depends on spousal income. New MBA mothers with
higher-earnings spouses reduce their labor supply considerably more than mothers with lowerearnings spouses. In fact, the first birth has only a modest and temporary impact on earnings for
MBA women with lower-earnings spouses.
Our finding that human capital and labor supply factors can account for most of the
gender gap in earnings among MBAs comports with that of Black, Haviland, Sanders and Taylor
(2008) for a broader group of U.S. college-educated women between 25 and 60 years old in the
1993 NSCG. Our finding of a large increase in the gender gap during the first ten to 15 years in
the careers of MBAs is similar to other studies exploring the dynamics of the gender earnings
gap for new lawyers (Wood, Corcoran, and Courant 1993) and for broader samples of young
workers (e.g., Light and Ureta 1995; Loprest 1992; and Manning and Swaffield 2008).6
B. University of Chicago MBA Survey and Sample
Our data come from a web-based survey we conducted of University of Chicago MBAs
from the graduating classes of 1990 to 2006.7 The participants were asked detailed questions
about each of the jobs or positions they had since graduation, including earnings (both at the
beginning and end of a given position), usual weekly hours worked, job function, sector, size of
firm, and type of firm. The earnings questions asked for total annual earnings, before taxes and

for college graduates, using samples largely restricted to those remaining in full-time work.

The survey was taken between November 2006 and June 2007. Only full-time MBA graduates were
included; part-time MBAs and executive MBAs were excluded.

other deductions, in the first and last year at each job.8 The responses to the earnings questions
and usual weekly hours worked in each position were collected in discrete bins that were
transformed into real-valued variables (at the mid-point of each bin).9 Respondents were also
asked why they had left a position and the reasons they took a subsequent job. Each position, or
spell with an employer, lasting six months or more constituted a separate “stage,” and all stages
were surveyed for the variables just listed. Information was gathered on all post-MBA spells of
non-employment (periods of six months or longer in which an individual was not working for
pay) and the reasons for these spells.
The survey responses were converted into an (unbalanced) individual-year panel dataset.
Individual earnings in a given year were computed by linear extrapolation based on earnings in
the first and last year of a given stage and the length of that stage. Administrative data from the
University of Chicago were matched to our individual-level survey data providing information
on MBA courses and grades, undergraduate school, undergraduate GPA, GMAT scores, and
demographic information (age, ethnicity, and immigration status). Respondents were also asked
about their current marital status and, for those currently married or living with a partner (we will
use “married” for both), about their spouse’s educational attainment, employment status and
earnings. All respondents were asked whether they had any children (biological or adopted), the
year of birth of each child and the allocation of childcare responsibilities in pre-school years
between themselves, their spouse, other family members, home care, and day care.
Among the MBAs in these classes with known e-mail addresses about 31 percent
responded to the survey.10 Of this group 2,485 (or 97 percent) were matched to University of
Chicago administrative records. These 1,856 men and 629 women form the basis of our sample.
8

Employees were asked to include salary and bonuses; the self-employed were asked for total earnings.
Possible answers to the earnings question were < $50K, $50-$75K, $75-$100K, $100-$150K, $150$200K, $200-$300K, $300-$400K, $400-$500K,$500-$750K, $750K-$1MM, $1-$2MM, and > $2MM.
We converted the answers into a real-valued earnings variable using the mid-point of each earnings bin;
we assigned earnings of $25K to those that responded earning less than $50K and earnings of $3MM to
those who indicated earning more than $2MM. The response bins for the usual weekly hours worked
questions ranged were < 20 hours, 20-30 hours, 30-40 hours, …, 90-100 hours, and > 100 hours.
10
Because e-mail addresses can fail without generating a return e-mail, the 31 percent response rate
should be considered a lower bound. The survey was sent to each MBA’s “life-time” University of
Chicago e-mail address and, when available, to his or her e-mail addresses listed in the Business School’s
alumni directory.

12-August-09, Dynamics 5

The University of Chicago has awarded about 570 MBAs annually since 1990 and 24 percent of
these have gone to women. The figure is considerably lower than the national average of MBAs
earned by women, which was about 40 percent for the same period, although it is less out of line
with the University of Chicago’s closest competitors.11
The respondents do not differ much from the non-respondents based on the observables.
Respondents are, to a slight degree, disproportionately female and U.S. citizens, and they had
somewhat better undergraduate and graduate records than the non-respondents (see Table A1).
We find about the same gender differences in pre-MBA background, MBA course selection and
MBA grades in the full sample of 1990-2006 graduates as in the sub-sample of those that
participated in our survey (Table A2). The women in our survey are slightly positively selected
on their undergraduate GPA compared with their male peers, and the survey respondents for both
genders are somewhat positively selected on GMAT scores and MBA GPA.
Relative to the male MBAs, the women are a bit younger at graduate school entry and
more often U.S. citizens; they did better as undergraduates but less well on the GMAT (Table
A2). Because the University of Chicago MBA program offers a flexible curriculum,
considerable variation exists in course selection. Women take relatively fewer finance and
accounting classes but relatively more marketing classes. Because of a school policy imposing a
maximum mean grade per class, the Chicago MBA program has not been subject to much grade
inflation and, in consequence, the MBA grades are reasonably comparable over time and reflect
performance in the program. Women have slightly lower graduate GPAs across all fields of
study with the largest gender gap in grades found in finance courses.
At the time of the survey, the female MBAs in the sample were less apt to be married
than their male counterparts (0.65 versus 0.81).12 If married, female MBAs were far less likely
to have a husband with fewer years of schooling than they. Female MBAs were less likely to
have any children by the year they exited the program (4 percent versus 16 percent), and they
remained less likely to have children by the time of the survey (42 percent versus 60 percent).
11

Among Harvard Business School MBAs for the same period, 31 percent were female.
Summary information on the career and family characteristics of our survey respondents overall and by
sex are given in Table A3.
12

12-August-09, Dynamics 6

Among the sub-sample of survey respondents that we can observe nine years after the MBA
program, 45 percent of women were still childless compared with 30 percent of men. Female
MBAs were more apt to have taken any time off work since receiving their MBA (27 percent
versus 10 percent). And 11 percent of the women across all cohorts were not working at the time
of our survey as compared to just 2 percent of the men.
Weekly hours are high for almost all MBA positions. They are highest in investment
banking and consulting, the two areas in which almost two-fifths of our sample took their first
post-MBA jobs (13 percent and 26 percent, respectively).13 The average investment banker put
in a whopping 74 hours per week, the average consultant 61 hours per week.14 Also reaching
close to the 60 hours per week mark are those employed in venture capital and sales and trading.
The share of MBAs working in the high hours sectors declines rapidly in the years
following graduation. The share working as consultants was 26 percent initially but 17 percent
four years after graduation and 12 percent at seven years or more after. MBAs also shift out of
investment banking with only 6 percent still working as investment bankers at seven or more
years after graduation. Employment shares in investment management, company finance, and
product management remain stable in the 15 years following graduation, and MBAs increasingly
move into general management as their careers progress.
C. Descriptive Dynamics
1. Labor Supply
Early in their careers labor force participation among the MBAs in our Chicago alumni
sample is extremely high and similar by gender (Table 1). But the gender gap in labor force
participation widens as careers progress with no more than 1 percent of males not working in any
given post-graduation year as compared to 13 percent of women not in the labor force by year

13

In contrast, only about one-fifth of MBA graduates worked in either consulting or investment banking
prior to entering the MBA program.
14
See Table A4 data for mean weekly hours for the most common job functions in our MBA sample.

nine and 17 percent of women not in the labor force ten or more years since their MBA.15
Differences are yet more pronounced comparing the fraction of men and women working fulltime and full-year in a given year (Table 1).16 The fraction of men working full-time, yearround, ranges between 91 and 94 percent in all years following graduation. Although 90 percent
of women are employed full-time and full-year immediately following graduation, 80 percent are
five years out, 70 percent nine years out, and 62 percent ten or more years out.17 For women
with at least one child, 52 percent work full-time and full-year ten or more years after MBA
completion and the figure is about the same (50 percent) for women with two or more children.
Gender differences in labor force participation translate into differences in actual post
MBA labor market experience. The fraction of men who had at least one career interruption (a
period of six months or more without working) is 4 percent a year after graduation and 10
percent by ten years out. In contrast, the fraction of women with at least one post-MBA career
interruption is 9 percent a year after graduation but 32 percent by year nine and 40 percent ten to
16 years after graduation.
Non-work spells are generally brief for both men and women, as indicated by the
tabulations of cumulative years not working by years since graduation in Table 1. The average
woman spends 0.22 years out of work by year five and 0.57 years out of work by year nine; for
men, the equivalent figures are 0.06 at year five and 0.10 at year nine. Ten years or more postMBA, mean cumulative years not working are 1.05 for women and just 0.12 for men.
Weekly work hours are high for all MBAs and highest among the newly minted. Men in
their first year out average 61 hours per week; women average 59 hours, despite being less likely
to start in investment banking where hours are especially long.18 Hours of work decline for male
15

The employment rate is relatively low for both men and women in the year of MBA graduation since
the entry-level MBA market takes some time to clear.
16
Our survey did not include a question on “full-time” versus “part-time” work. We assign “full-time”
(“part-time”) status to those who report working > [30-40] hours/week (at most [30-40] hours/week).
17
Our figure of 62 percent is close to that from an often-cited Catalyst study by Hollenshead and Wilt
(2000), showing that 66 percent of the female graduates from 12 top MBA programs were working fulltime (but not necessarily year-round) approximately ten to 16 years after receiving their MBA.

U.S. law firms in the career dynamics of young lawyers.

and female MBAs in the years following graduation, but far more so for women. Four years
after receiving their MBA, women work around 55 hours per week while men work around 59
hours; nine years out, women work around 51 hours per week, while men work around 57 hours.
Although hours of work are long for most MBAs, a large share of MBA women work
part-time (defined as 30 to 40 hours or less per week). The incidence of part-time work among
employed MBA women increases with years since graduation, from 5 percent during the first
year to 22 percent at ten to 16 years out. Whereas about 17 percent of MBA women are not
working at ten to 16 years out, another 18 percent [0.22 × (1 – 0.17)] are working part-time.19
Part-time work, therefore, is more prevalent than is non-employment for MBA women, even
more than a decade after the MBA. But part-time positions are rare for those who remain in the
corporate sector, especially in investment banking and consulting. One year after graduation, 4
percent of salaried women work part-time, 8 percent by year five, and 12 percent at ten years or
more post-MBA. How, then, do 22 percent of MBA women 10 to 16 years out work part-time?
MBA women use self-employment as a means to work fewer hours and 57 percent of the
MBA women who work part-time do so through self-employment. Immediately following
graduation, 29 percent of self-employed women work part-time; 32 percent do by year five. Ten
years or more post-MBA, 62 percent of self-employed women work part-time.20 In contrast,
only 15 percent of self-employed men work part-time ten to 16 years out. The shares of working
men and women who are self-employed are similar up to nine years following graduation
(growing from less than 2 percent at graduation to 11 to 13 percent nine years out), but a surge in
self-employment among MBA women occurs ten to 16 years out, with 20 percent of working
women being self-employed compared with 14 percent for men.
19

Gender differences in labor supply for Chicago Booth MBAs are quite similar to gender gaps around
ten years after MBA completion for those in the 1989 to 1992 BA cohort of the Harvard and Beyond
(H&B) sample who went on to get an MBA. The H&B male MBAs in these cohorts had a 98 percent
employment rate as compared with an 82 percent employment rate for the H&B female MBAs in 2006.
Conditional on being employed in 2006, the H&B male MBAs worked 55 hours per week on average
with only 3 percent working part-time, and the H&B female MBAs worked 44 hours per week on average
with 29 percent working part-time. A substantial gender gap in hours of work for those who received
MBAs from 1990 to 2003 is also apparent for the 2003 NSCG with employed male MBAs working 49
hours per week on average as compared to 44 hours per week for employed female MBAs.
20
The share of part-timers is even higher among self-employed women with no employees: nearly 75
percent of them work part-time ten to 16 years out.

12-August-09, Dynamics 9

By far the most common job function among self-employed part-timers is consulting.
More than 30 percent of self-employed part-timers are consultants, whereas among full-timers
only 18 percent are. For those who work in established firms, however, consulting offers less
opportunity for part-time work: fewer than 3 percent of salaried part-timers are consultants.
In summary, MBAs in our sample are concentrated in job functions that generally have
long hours. Hours decline with time since MBA for both men and women, in part reflecting a
move out of investment banking and consulting and towards general management positions in
corporations. But weekly hours worked drop considerably more for women, driven largely by a
growing share working part-time, often self-employed. Women are increasingly more likely to
be out of the workforce with years since MBA, although the average female MBA accumulates
only half a year of non-employment in the first nine years after graduation. Part-time work for
women is a more important factor than “opting out” behavior (non-employment) in explaining
the lower incidence of full-time and full-year work for women than for men in the first 15 years
after MBA completion.
2. Earnings
Labor market earnings are a key summary measure of career progress and ultimate
success. We construct earnings for each calendar year by taking the annualized total earnings
(including bonuses) from the stage worked at the end of that calendar year. In this manner,
earnings per year are constructed as “full year” earnings in the last job held in that year and not
necessarily actual earnings for the year.21
Earnings (expressed in 2006 dollars) advance substantially with time since MBA, as is
clear from Table 2 and Figure 1. The growth is a hefty 8.9 percent average annual rate for all

21

We have also averaged the annualized earnings of all working stages during the calendar year for those
with multiple stages in a year (weighting each stage by its length). This definition also computes full-year
earnings, which may differ from actual earnings for those employed only part of the year. There are no
notable differences in the findings between the two earnings measures.

12-August-09, Dynamics 10

MBAs.22 The average MBA earns $126K at graduation (median is $122K) and close to $370K
nine years out (median is around $190K). Both the level and rate of change are greatest for those
starting in investment banking, which attracts a substantial number of recent MBA graduates.
Those starting their careers in investment banking earn on average $170K at graduation (median
is $160K) and close to $700K nine years out (median is $470K), whether or not they are still
employed in investment banking. Earnings levels and growth are similar for investment
management (not reported in the table). The consulting track, the other most prevalent career
option among MBAs, is less remunerative than investment banking and investment management.
Mean earnings by sex are comparable directly following MBA receipt, but they diverge
every subsequent year. Women earn $115K on average at graduation and $250K nine years out;
men earn $130K on average at graduation and $400K nine years out. Median salaries by sex
also diverge in favor of men with years since graduation but not by as much as do mean salaries.
Mean differences in earnings between men and women (conditional only on all cohort ×
year dummies) are given in Table 3 arrayed by years since receipt of the MBA. The 11 log point
gender earnings gap at graduation jumps to 31 log points at five years out, 40 log points at nine
years out and nearly 60 log points at ten or more years out (col. 2). The time profile of the
earnings gap is roughly similar for the subset who start a new job in that year (col. 3).
D. Explaining the Gender Gap in Labor Supply
Gender differences in labor supply expand substantially with years since completing an
MBA even when adding cohort (MBA graduating class) effects, calendar year effects, and their
interactions (Table 3, cols. 4 to 8). Nine years out, women are about 12 percentage points less
likely than men to be working (col. 5) and have spent half a year more than the average man out
of work since the MBA (col. 4). Although only a 3 log point difference in weekly hours worked
exists in the first post-MBA job, the difference grows to about 14 log points nine years out and to
20 log points at ten or more years after graduation (col. 8).

The calculation assumes an average of 13 years for the ten to 16-year cell.

The reasons for gender differences in labor supply are explored in Tables 4 and 5, which
include a full set of cohort × year dummies as well as controls for pre-MBA characteristics and
MBA performance.23 The unit of observation is a survey respondent in a given year. Table 4
explores the role of children and Table 5 adds comparisons by spousal income.
The 8.4 percentage point gap in employment between men and women, perhaps not
surprisingly, is largely driven by women with children, as can be seen by comparing the first two
columns of Table 4. A woman with at least one child is 20 percentage points less likely to work
in a given year than the average man, whereas a woman without children is only 3 percentage
points less likely to be employed than the average man (col. 2). A woman with at least one child
has about 0.7 fewer years of actual labor market experience than the typical man in the sample;
this difference is only 0.1 year for a woman without children (col. 4). Although there is a 9 log
point mean difference in weekly hours worked between employed men and women, it is 24 log
points for women with kids and only 3 log points for women without kids (col. 6).
More interesting is that the “impact” of children on female labor supply differs to a large
degree by spousal earnings (Table 5). Because our survey asked for spousal earnings only in the
current year, we use spousal current (survey date) earnings as a proxy for spousal earnings in any
prior year. We then separate women into those with “lower” earnings (less than $100K per year)
spouses, “medium” earnings (between $100K and $200K per year) spouses and “high” earnings
(more than $200K per year) spouses. These spousal earnings categories are then interacted with
an indicator variable for whether or not a woman has at least one child in a given year, thereby
comparing the average man to six different groups of women.24
The effect of motherhood on the likelihood that a woman is not working is more than
twice as large if the woman has a high-earnings spouse rather than a lower-earnings spouse:
23

The pre-MBA controls include a quadratic in age; a U.S. citizen dummy; dummies for race; dummies
for “top 10” and “top 10 to 20” undergraduate institutions (from the U.S. News & World Report
rankings); undergraduate GPA; quantitative and verbal GMAT scores; and dummies for industry and job
function in the last job before entering the MBA program. Our controls for MBA performance are the
MBA GPA and the fraction of finance-related classes taken during the program.
24
Sample sizes differ between Tables 4 and 5 since the Table 5 specifications include only women who
were married or living with someone at the survey date.

12-August-09, Dynamics 12

these mothers are 30 percentage points less likely to work than the average man (Table 5, col. 1;
0.119 + 0.185). Mothers with a medium-earnings spouse also work less than those with a
lower-earnings spouse, but the difference is smaller and not statistically significant. Similarly,
mothers with high-earnings spouses accumulate about six months more in non-employment
spells following MBA completion and, even when employed, have a workweek that is 19 log
points shorter than mothers with low-earnings spouses (cols. 2 and 3).
Among women without children greater spousal earnings appear to increase, rather than
decrease, labor supply. In fact, a woman without children married to high-earnings spouse is
about as likely to work (the gap is only 2 percentage points), to accumulate post-MBA work
experience, and to put in a long work week (women are actually higher by 3 log points) as the
typical male in our sample. These findings suggest positive assortative mating based on
preferences for work. The sharp reversal in labor supply patterns for MBA women by spousal
income that occurs with motherhood seems most consistent with the notion that previously hardworking women slow down after their first birth if they have a high-earnings spouse.
Because spousal income may be endogenous to own labor supply choices and because we
measure spousal income only in the survey year, we have replicated the analysis using spousal
education levels. We contrast the labor supply of mothers married to men who are at least as
educated as they (having MBA, JD, MD and related degrees, or PhD) to that of mothers with
less-educated spouses. We find the same qualitative pattern of results as in Table 5.25
MBA mothers whose spouses earn over $150K indicate being responsible for 52 percent
of their children’s care as compared with only 32 percent for MBA mothers with lower-earnings
spouses.26 The difference is almost fully explained by the use of formal day care center (12
percent with high-earnings spouses versus 31 percent with lower-earnings spouses). That is,
MBA mothers with better-off husbands take a larger share of the responsibility for child care
(relative to their spouses and others) than do other MBA women. Greater spousal income
25

We also investigated how children affect male labor supply based on wives’ earnings (and education),
but found no significant impacts of the presence of children or of spousal income on male labor supply.
26
When we use three types of earnings we called the > $200K group “high,” but when we use two
groups, as we do here, we term the > $150K group “high.”

purchases more high-priced child-care time of the MBA mother, not more nannies.
In summary, parental status accounts for the bulk of the difference in labor supply
between male and female MBAs. The impact of children on female labor supply is strongly
related to spousal income, with mothers in better-off households slowing down much more.27
E. Explaining the Gender Gap in Earnings
To understand why female MBAs have lower incomes than male MBAs, we estimate
(log) annual earnings equations that pool all individual-year observations. The impact of the
various factors discussed, including pre-MBA characteristics, MBA courses, post-MBA job
experience, and non-working spells, on the gender gap in earnings, is explored. The estimation
in Table 6 is done with and without controlling for weekly hours worked. The novelty of the
estimation is our use of information on all job stages previously held by an individual.
The raw gap in earnings between men and women in the pooled sample is about 29 log
points including only cohort × year dummies (col. 1). The inclusion of pre-MBA characteristics,
MBA GPA, and fraction of finance classes reduces the gender gap to 19 log points (col. 2). The
difference in mean MBA GPA between men and women in the sample of 0.13 (3.38 versus 3.25)
implies (using the estimated coefficient of 0.429 on MBA GPA in col. 2) that the gender
difference in MBA grades alone can account for a gender earnings gap of nearly 6 log points.
Each additional finance class increases earnings by about 8 log points and women take about half
a class less in finance than men.28
Labor supply factors explain most of the remaining gender gap in earnings. The
inclusion of a full set of dummy variables for weekly hours worked reduces the raw gender gap
of 29 log points (col. 1) to 17 log points (col. 4). Adding hours worked to the specification
including pre-MBA characteristics and MBA performance lowers the remaining gender gap to 9
27

Of course, neither marital nor parental statuses are randomly assigned and it is possible that women’s
decisions to get married, whom to marry and whether or not to have children are related to unobservable
characteristics that might directly impact earnings. We explore that possibility below.
28
Finance classes pay off even for those not starting in investment banking or investment management.

log points (col. 5). The gender earnings gap is reduced to just 6.4 log points (col. 6) with the
further addition of a quadratic term for post-MBA years of actual work experience and a dummy
variable for the presence of any post-MBA career interruption. Augmenting the model with
(arguably less exogenous) variables to control for reasons for choosing one’s current job, job
function, and employer type further reduces the coefficient on the female dummy to a
(statistically insignificant) –3.8 log points (col. 9).29
The estimates from our preferred specification in col. (6) of Table 6 can be used to obtain
the earnings penalty from taking time out. The loss is 23 log points from taking any time out
plus an additional amount from accumulating less post-MBA experience. An MBA observed six
years after business school graduation with at least one non-employment spell in that period had
an average employment spell of 4.97 years and thus an average non-employment spell of 1.03
years. The penalty from taking that amount of time off is 37 log points of which about twothirds is due to the discrete earnings loss from taking any time off.30 The earnings loss from
time out is even greater using the estimates that do not hold hours constant (col. 3). The full
earnings loss (among the employed), using those coefficients, is around 46 log points. Wage
penalties we estimate (for the typical out-of-work spell at six years after MBA completion) are
uniformly high across all career tracks: 36 log points in consulting, 45 log points in investment
banking or investment management, and 45 log points in other functions. 31 The earnings loss
from any career interruption is large in our MBA sample.
The models in Table 6 restrict the impact of career interruptions to be identical for men
and women. Although it is possible that women are more heavily penalized for taking time out,
estimates from separate earnings regressions by sex using the specification from Table 6, col. (6)
do not support that suspicion. The wage penalty for men, using our standardized career
interruption at six years out, is 45 log points whereas that for women is 26 log points. Taking
29

The basic findings are almost identical for log hourly wage regressions as for log annual earnings
regressions that include controls for weekly hours worked. See Table A5 for log hourly wage regressions,
comparable to the specifications in Table 6, for the full pooled sample.
30
The penalty for an average non-work spell of an individual 6 years out from the MBA would be:
[(0.085 × 4.967) + (0.005 × 4.9672) – 0.228] – [(0.085 × 6) + (0.005 × 62)] = 0.372. Note that in the
entire sample 27 percent of the women, but 10 percent of the men, took time off.
31
We re-estimated the specification in col. (6) separately for each of the subgroups.

12-August-09, Dynamics 15

any time out appears more harmful for men (26 log points) than for women (11 log points).32
Similar calculations for a standardized career interruption based on the col. (3) specification,
which does not hold hours constant, result in penalties for taking time out of 48 log points for
men and 38 log points for women. For women, but less so for men, a career interruption usually
goes hand in hand with a substantial reduction in weekly hours upon returning to work. The data
do not indicate that MBA women lose more than MBA men for taking time out. It appears that
everyone is penalized heavily for deviating from the norm.
An analysis of the gender earnings gap by years since MBA graduation is given in Table
7. The (uncorrected) gender wage gap is 9 log points just after MBA completion. It rises to 25
log points three years out, to 38 log points at nine years out, and to 57 log points for the ten to 16
years out group. But even the largest of these gender gaps in earnings is entirely eliminated by
the inclusion of the observables, particularly job interruptions and hours of work. That detail,
however, overlooks the changing importance of the various factors with time since MBA.
Within the first three years after receipt of the MBA the earnings gap between men and
women expands by 16 log points. As much as a third of the increase appears to be due to
growing labor market returns with experience to pre-MBA characteristics as well as MBA course
performance. Gender differences in career interruptions and the accumulation of years of labor
market experience do not expand much in the first three years in the labor market (as seen in
Table1), but the gender gap in hours worked is already an important factor for the gender
earnings gap by year three (as suggested by comparing the gender gap estimates in rows 4 and 5
of Table 7). During the next six years (from year three to nine), the gender earnings gap grows
by another 12 log points. At this juncture career interruptions become a more important factor
and weekly hours also play a key role. The addition of controls for career interruptions reduces
the 12.4 log point increase from year three to nine by 5.6 log points and the inclusion of controls
for weekly hours (in row 5) more than eliminates the remaining growth of the gender earnings
gap. Of the increase in the gender earnings gap by 29 log points in the first nine years following

32

A larger discrete earnings loss associated with having any career interruption for men than for women
is also found in earnings regressions including person fixed effects.

12-August-09, Dynamics 16

MBA completion, 8 log points can be accounted for by adding pre-job characteristics and a
further 19 log points by adding controls for career interruptions and hours of work.
Because our full sample is an unbalanced panel, the dynamics of change in the gender
gap could reflect differential changes in sample composition by sex with years since MBA
completion. To address this issue, we have replicated the analysis in Table 7 limiting the sample
to those who completed their MBA prior to 1998, holding sample composition constant up to
eight years out. The results are similar for the full sample and for the pre-1998 cohorts.
Large earnings differences relative to men are apparent even for women who have taken
no career breaks up to the post-MBA year considered (see Table A6). The total change in the
earnings gap to year nine is 20 log points. Most (70 percent) of this total change can be
accounted for by the increasing importance of pre-job (MBA and pre-MBA) characteristics and
rising differences in weekly hours between men and this group of women.
Even women with no career interruptions have children and some of these women will
work fewer hours and be less available for career moves. Limiting the sample to women without
children and with no career interruptions by ten years out makes the career paths of the women
in the sample more similar to those of men. For that comparison, the gender earning gap starts
out slightly larger than for all women, but it grows less rapidly (see Table A7). The gap in
earnings between this sub-group of women and all men increases by 15 log points in the first ten
years after the MBA. This entire increase in the gender pay gap can be accounted for by the
greater importance of pre-MBA and MBA characteristics with years since MBA receipt.
Furthermore, we find no growth in the gender gap in weekly hours worked with years since
MBA for the women in this sub-group.
F. Selection and Family Status
A large part of the difference between male and female earnings comes from job
interruptions and most job interruptions are due to children. MBA women who become mothers
might be selected on unobservables that could directly lead to lower earnings in the absence of
12-August-09, Dynamics 17

children. But we uncover no evidence that MBA women who marry and have children are
drawn from the lower part of the female earnings distribution (Table 8). To the contrary, we find
that married women have slightly higher predicted earnings than unmarried women and those
with children have slightly higher predicted earnings than those without children, using a
measure of predicted earnings based on pre-MBA characteristics and MBA performance.33
MBA women who have children are not negatively selected in terms of predicted earnings levels
and may even be positively selected. MBA mothers are, as well, positively selected on actual
early career earnings as well. In unreported regressions, we find that the MBA women with a
first birth three or more years following MBA completion earned about 4 log points more in the
first two years following MBA completion than their female classmates who do not have
children by our survey date. We also find some positive assortative mating on earnings potential
with women whose spouses are more-educated having slightly higher predicted earnings than
women who marry less educated men (col. 3 of Table 8).
G. More on the Role of Children and Career Interruptions in the Dynamics of the Gender Gap
Because differences in earnings and employment between male and female MBAs appear
to be largely associated with the presence of children, we use the (retrospectively-constructed)
panel structure of the data to explore career dynamics after a first birth in Tables 9 and 10. The
regressions include person fixed effects, cohort × year dummies, a quadratic in age, and a set of
indicator variables for the year surrounding the first child’s birth—dummy variables for one or
two years before the birth, the year of the birth, one or two years after the birth, three or four
years after the birth, and greater than four years after the birth. The coefficients on these
variables summarize the dynamics of labor supply and earnings responses to a first birth relative
to the base period of three or more years prior to the first birth.34
MBA women reduce their labor supply on both the extensive and intensive margins after
a birth. There is a large decline in labor force participation in the year of the first birth and a
33

The predicted value of log (annual earnings) for all individuals is regressed on interactions of marital
status and sex in one regression and, in a separate regression, on interactions of sex with whether an
individual has a child. The predicted value of earnings is based on a full set of pre-MBA characteristics
and MBA performance measures (see the notes to Table 8 for details).
34
The regression samples exclude individuals who had children prior to completing their MBA.

12-August-09, Dynamics 18

further reduction over the next four years. A woman’s likelihood of not working in a year is
about 13 percentage points higher in the two years immediately following her first birth than in
the base period, increasing to 18 to 19 percentage points higher at three years following the birth
and beyond (Table 9, col. 2). Similarly, weekly hours worked for the employed (col. 10)
decrease discretely in the year of the first birth and continue to decline over the next four years,
reaching a 24 log point deficit relative to the pre-birth base period. This reduction in weekly
hours is associated with a large shift into part-time work and self-employment in the four years
following a first birth. 35 In contrast, there is no decline in labor force participation and only a
small (4 log points) decline in weekly hours worked in the one or two years before the first birth.
MBA moms are, if anything, slightly more likely to work in the two years that precede the birth
of their first child than in the base period of three or more years before their first birth.
Women’s earnings (among those remaining employed) decline only modestly in the year
of the first birth but decline sharply over the next several years especially around three to four
years after the birth (Table 9, col. 4). A woman’s earnings drop by about 30 log points relative
to the pre-birth base period at three years or more after the birth. When we control for hours
worked (col. 11), we find that annual earnings (essentially hourly wage rates) are unchanged in
the two years immediately following the first birth but decrease by 6 to 7 log points after that.
Thus, earnings decline linearly with hours worked in the first two years after the first
birth, but (hourly) wage penalties (associated with career interruptions) become evident for MBA
women about three years after the birth. A woman’s annual earnings (including the nonemployed) fall modestly in the year of the first birth and continue declining over the next several
years reaching a $100K deficit relative to the base period by five years after the birth (col. 8).
The decreases in women’s labor supply and earnings that expand three to four years after
a first birth could reflect the impact of subsequent births. But we find large reductions in labor

35

The share of MBA women working part-time increases from 5 percent two years before a first birth to
34 percent four years after a first birth with about half of this increase accounted for by women shifting
into self-employment. Herr and Wolfram (2009) emphasize that corporate work environments contribute
to MBA mothers’ decisions to exit the labor force at motherhood. We find, in addition, that MBA
mothers shift into self-employment, and also that self-employment enables part-time work.

12-August-09, Dynamics 19

supply and earnings four years after a first birth even for women who do not have a subsequent
birth.36 In fact, we find the birth of a second child has little additional adverse effect on women’s
labor supply and earnings.
In contrast, MBA men with children see their earnings increase, not decrease, especially
five years and more after birth of their first child (Table 9, cols. 3, 5, and 7). Male labor supply
is virtually unaffected by fatherhood in our MBA sample (cols. 1 and 9).
Obvious reasons exist why women choose to cut back on work after giving birth. But
MBA mothers may also be forced out, or at least out of the fast-track. Suggestive evidence
exists, however, that the observed patterns of decreased labor supply and earnings substantially
reflect women’s choices given family constraints and the inflexibility of work schedules in many
corporate and finance sector jobs. The differential impact of children on women’s labor supply
by her spouse’s income and education (see Table 5) seems consistent with such an interpretation.
The differential dynamic impacts of a first birth on women’s labor market outcomes by
husband’s income are illustrated in Table 10, where we estimate separate regressions (using the
Table 9 specifications) for married women by spousal earnings (more than or less than $200K).37
New MBA mothers with higher-earning spouses reduce their likelihood of working by 17
percentage points in the year of first birth (relative to the base period) and by 28 percentage
points three to four years after the birth (col. 6). In contrast, MBA women with lower-earning
spouses have an increased employment rate in the two years prior to a first birth and experience
no noticeable change in the likelihood of employment (relative to the pre-birth base period)
following the birth (col. 1). Weekly hours (conditional on employment) drop for both groups in
the year of a first birth and in the four years following the birth (cols. 4 and 9). The total annual
earnings decline (including those not working) associated with motherhood is large and
persistent for MBA women with higher-earning spouses. The decline is quite modest for women
with lower-earning spouses and does not persist beyond the first four years after the first birth.

36

These findings derive from (unreported) regressions in which we add a dummy variable, to the
specifications in Table 9, for the two years immediately following the birth of a second child.
37
These results are replicated in Table A8 for spouses by education group rather than income.

12-August-09, Dynamics 20

Corroborating evidence arguing for some type of choice can be gleaned from the reasons
MBA women give for not working, leaving their previous job, and for choosing a new job (Table
11). The probability that a woman is not working for career-related reasons (which include
“layoff” and “suitable job not available”) does not change post-birth (col. 2). Instead, all of the
reduction in labor force participation for MBA women following a first birth observed in Table 9
can be attributed to an increase in the likelihood of not working for family-related reasons
(which include “do not need or want to work,” “home taking care of parents or other relatives”
and “home raising children”) as seen in Table 11, col. (1).
What motivates mothers to choose their current job largely differs from what motivated
them before they had children. Post-birth, women are 20 to 26 percentage points more likely to
be in a job chosen for family-related reasons than in the pre-birth base period (col. 3) and 13 to
21 percentage points less likely to have chosen their job for career-related reasons (col. 4).
These changes in career orientation are not limited to when their children were infants but persist
five or more years after the first birth.38
Choice does not mean that earnings are not greatly affected, and large negative wage
changes are associated with taking a new job for family-related reasons and for leaving a prior
job for family-related reasons (Table A9, panel B). Earnings decline 64 log points when the new
job is chosen because of “flexible hours,” 20 log points when the new job is chosen because of
an “opportunity to work remotely,” and 7 log points when the new job is chosen because of a
“limited travel schedule.” The large role of family factors and desires for flexible hours in the
job mobility decisions of women with children generates the striking differences in the wage
changes by gender and parental status associated with job changes (Table A9, panel A). Job
changes in our MBA sample are income neutral for women without children and for men. But
women with children lose nearly 18 log points in earnings when they shift jobs.
MBA mothers may emphasize family over career in choosing their jobs, but it is still
possible that their jobs involve lower earnings and fewer career advancement opportunities
38

Family reasons for choosing a given job include: “flexible hours”; “opportunity to work remotely”; and
“limited travel schedule.” Career reasons for choosing a given job include: “career advancement or
broadening”; “compensation and other benefits,” and “prestige.”

12-August-09, Dynamics 21

because of differential treatment. This claim is difficult to evaluate directly. We examine the
likelihood of leaving a given job, as well as the likelihood of leaving for family or career-related
reasons, conditioning on the stated reasons for originally choosing that job (Table 11, cols. 5 to
8). If MBA mothers were being sidelined in their current jobs, one might have expected them to
be more likely to quit (or even be forced out) for career-related reasons. Yet, we find little
evidence of that (cols. 5, 7 and 8). We do find that women are more likely to leave a job for
family reasons in the two years before a birth (col. 6), suggesting some re-optimization of job
choices in anticipation of children. Of course, the evidence does not rule out discrimination
since women facing such career barriers still may give family reasons for job changes.
H. Summary and Conclusions
We have examined gender differences in the career dynamics of MBAs who graduated
from a top U.S. business school—the Booth School of Business of the University of Chicago —
from 1990 to 2006. Immediately following MBA completion male and female MBAs from this
elite program have nearly identical labor incomes and work nearly the same weekly hours. But
the gender gap in annual earnings expands considerably as their careers progress reaching almost
60 log points at ten to 16 years after MBA completion.
We identify three proximate factors that can explain the large and rising gender gap in
earnings: (1) a modest male advantage in training prior to MBA graduation combined with rising
labor market returns to such training with post-MBA experience; (2) gender differences in career
interruptions combined with large earnings losses associated with any career interruption (of six
or more months); and (3) growing gender differences in weekly hours worked with years since
MBA. Differential changes by sex in labor market activity in the period surrounding a first birth
play a key role in this process. The presence of children is associated with less accumulated job
experience, more career interruptions, shorter work hours, and substantial earnings declines for
female but not for male MBAs. The one exception is that an adverse impact of children on
employment and earnings is not found for female MBAs with lower-earning husbands.

12-August-09, Dynamics 22

Are career-family tradeoffs faced by female MBAs in the corporate and financial sectors
similar to those in other high-powered occupations? We have done a preliminary exploration of
these issues using the Harvard and Beyond (H&B) project to examine the careers of Harvard
graduates from the undergraduate classes of 1969 to 1973, 1979 to 1982, and 1989 to 1992.39
We find that female MBAs appear to have a more difficult time combining career and family
than do female physicians, PhDs, and lawyers.40
Fifteen years after obtaining their BA women who earned an MBA had the lowest labor
force participation rates, the lowest share working full-time and full-year, and took the greatest
amount of (non-educational) time off from employment compared with others having
professional degrees and PhDs (Goldin and Katz 2008). The differences are greatest for those
with children.41 Less than 50 percent of the MBA women were both in the labor force (part-time
or full-time) and had children 15 years out; in contrast, the same figures for the other groups are
65 percent for MDs and about 55 percent for the PhDs and JDs. Female physicians take the
briefest non-employment spells after having a child, followed by PhDs, then lawyers, and finally
MBAs who take the greatest amount of time off for family reasons. For those graduating college
around 1990, only 75 percent of mothers with MBAs were employed 15 years after Harvard
graduation compared with 96 percent of those with MDs, 89 percent of those with PhDs, and 82
percent of those with JDs; only mothers without any post-graduate education were less likely to
work 15 years out than mothers with MBAs (73 percent).42
Log earnings regressions for 2005 annual earnings in the H&B sample using a
specification similar to that in Table 6, col. (6), indicate larger earnings costs to career
39

See Goldin and Katz (2008) for details.
For analyses of gender earnings and promotion gaps, and career-family trade-offs, for professions, see
Wood, Corcoran, and Courant (1993) on lawyers; Sasser (2005) and Reyes (2006) on physicians; Preston
(2004) and Ginther and Kahn (2006) on science professionals; and Ginther (2006) on academics. In
related work, Ellwood, Wilde, and Batchelder (2004) find larger negative impacts of childbearing on the
wage trajectories of high skill (high AFQT) women than of less skilled (low AFQT) women.
41
Working with a partially overlapping sample of women who received BAs from Harvard University
between 1988 and 1991, Herr and Wolfram (2009) find nearly identical results to those in the H&B
sample for labor force participation rates among those graduating college around 1990.
42
Women with children in our MBA sample were slightly more likely to be employed than in the H&B
sample (77 percent were working ten or more years after their MBA). If we restrict the H&B data to
MBAs from top business schools the results are closer to the University of Chicago MBA sample.

interruptions for MBAs than for MDs, JDs, or PhDs. The earnings penalty in 2005 for an 18
month career interruption for those in the Harvard graduating classes of 1989 to 1992, at around
six to 12 years after completing a graduate or professional degree, was 0.16 log points for MDs,
0.34 log points for JDs and PhDs, and 0.53 log points for MBAs. Furthermore, a large discrete
and persistent earnings loss is associated with any career interruption for MBAs, while for MDs
the cost of taking time off is fairly linear in foregone labor market experience.
We can only speculate about why different costs exist to taking time off and opting for
lower hours across professions. Inherent differences in production technologies and in the
organization of work may make the productivity costs to discontinuous experience and more
flexible hours greater in the business and corporate sectors than in medicine or academia. The
economic benefits of re-organizing work to reduce the productivity costs of career interruptions
and more flexible work options may be greater in professions where there is a larger share (or
critical mass) of women in the talent pool. A tipping point may have been reached in fields
where women have become a majority (or nearly the majority) of the young talent (such as
medicine, veterinary medicine, optometry, pharmacy, and accounting) but not yet for MBAs and
the business and financial sectors. It is also possible that there is more career commitment in
those professions requiring greater upfront time investment, such as a PhD or an MD as opposed
to an MBA. Additionally, female MBAs often have husbands with higher earnings than female
PhDs and MDs allowing them the luxury to slowdown in the market and spend more time with
their children. The career costs of that decision may not be evident until much later.

means and medians for survey respondents whose first post-MBA job function was consulting (cols. 7 and 8) or investment banking
(cols. 9 and 10). The existence of duplicate numbers (e.g., 204,878) is because these are medians in 2006 dollars.

Notes: The unit of observation is a survey respondent in a given post-MBA year. Each column
corresponds to a different regression and each includes (cohort × year) dummies and interactions
between a female dummy and dummy variables for the number of years since receipt of the
MBA. The table reports the estimated coefficients on the interaction terms between the female
dummy and years since receiving the MBA. “Annual earnings” is defined as total earnings
before taxes and other deductions, including salary and bonus, and is coded as missing when the
individual is not working. “Hourly wage” is computed by dividing annual earnings by (weekly
hours worked × 52). Col. (3) includes only the first year at a given job. Standard errors (in
brackets) are clustered at the individual level; § significant at 5%; * significant at 1%.

Notes: The unit of observation is a survey respondent in a given post-MBA year. “Female with
child” (“Female without child”) is a dummy variable that equals 1 if the respondent is a female
and has at least one child (no child) in that year. Pre-MBA characteristics include: a dummy for
U.S. citizen, a White dummy, an Asian dummy, a dummy for “top 10” undergraduate institution,
a dummy for “top 10-20” undergraduate institution, undergraduate GPA, a dummy for missing
undergraduate GPA, a quadratic in age, verbal GMAT score, quantitative GMAT score, a
dummy for pre-MBA industry and a dummy for pre-MBA job function. MBA performance
includes overall MBA GPA and fraction of finance classes. Standard errors (in brackets) are
clustered at the individual level; * significant at 1%.

Notes: The unit of observation is a survey respondent in a given post-MBA year. The sample
includes only women who were married or living with someone at the survey date and also
dropped women with missing information on spousal income; men are included regardless of
marital status. “Female with child” (“without child”) is a dummy variable that equals one if the
respondent is a female and has at least one child (no child) in that year. “Spouse with high
earnings” is a dummy variable that equals one if the respondent reports that his/her spouse or
significant other earns at least $200,000 in the survey year, 0 otherwise. “Spouse with medium
earnings” is a dummy variable that equals one if the respondent reports that his/her spouse or
significant other earns at least $100,000 and at most $200,000 in the survey year, 0 if the
respondent reports that his/her spouse or significant other earns at most $100,000 or at least
$200,000 in the survey year. Pre-MBA characteristics include: a dummy for US citizen, a White
dummy, an Asian dummy, a dummy for “top 10” undergraduate institution, a dummy for “top 10
to 20” undergraduate institution, undergraduate GPA, a dummy for missing undergraduate GPA,
a quadratic in age, verbal GMAT score, quantitative GMAT score, a dummy for pre-MBA
industry and a dummy for pre-MBA job function. MBA performance includes overall MBA
GPA and fraction of finance classes. Standard errors (in brackets) are clustered at the individual

Notes: The unit of observation is a survey respondent in a given post-MBA year. The results are
robust to limiting the sample to only survey respondents with non-missing pre-MBA
characteristics. Pre-MBA characteristics include: a dummy for U.S. citizen, a “white” dummy,
an Asian dummy, a dummy for “top 10” undergraduate institution, a dummy for “top 10 to 20”
undergraduate institution, undergraduate GPA, a dummy for missing undergraduate GPA, a
quadratic in age, verbal GMAT score, quantitative GMAT score, a dummy for pre-MBA
industry and a dummy for pre-MBA job function. “Any no work spell” is a dummy variable that
equals 1 for a given individual in a given year if the individual experiences a period of at least
six months without work between MBA graduation and that year. “Weekly hours worked”
dummies include: < 20 hours, 20 to 29, 30 to 39, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, 60 to 69, 70 to 79, 80 to 89,
90 to 99, and ≥ 100 hours. “Reason for choosing job” dummies include: Compensation and
other benefits; Career advancement or broadening; Prestige; Culture/people/environment;
Flexible hours; Reasonable total hours per week; Limited travel schedule; Opportunity to work
remotely; Location; Other. “Employer type” dummies include: Public for-profit, < 100
employees; Public for-profit, 100 to 1,000 employees; Public for-profit, 1,000 to 15,000
employees; Public for-profit, > 15,000 employees; Private for-profit, < 100 employees; Private

Notes: The dependent variable in each equation is log (annual earnings). Each cell corresponds
to a different regression. The unit of observation is a survey respondent in a given post-MBA
year. In the regression without any controls, the sample is restricted to those survey respondents
with non-missing pre-MBA characteristics. All regressions include (cohort × year) dummies and
a female dummy. In each column, the sample is restricted to (individual × year) observations
that correspond to the number of years since graduation listed in that column. Each cell gives the
estimated coefficient on the female dummy. The controls for Pre-MBA characteristics, Weekly
Hours Worked, and Reason for Choosing a Job are the same as those described in the notes to
Table 6. MBA performance includes overall MBA GPA and fraction of finance classes. Labor
market experience includes a quadratic in actual experience since MBA graduation, a dummy
variable for “any no work spell” and dummy variables for weekly hours worked. Job setting
characteristics include job function dummies and “Employer type” dummies. “Employer type”
dummies include: Public for-profit, < 100 employees; Public for-profit, 100 to 1,000 employees;
Public for-profit, 1,000 to 15,000 employees; Public for-profit, > 15,000 employees; Private forprofit, < 100 employees; Private for-profit, 101 to 1,000 employees; Private for-profit, 1,000 to

Notes: The unit of observation is a survey respondent. Each column corresponds to a different regression.
The sample in column (2) is restricted to respondents who were married at the time of the survey. The
dependent variable in all regressions is predicted log (annual earnings) constructed as follows. In the
sample of male respondents, log (annual earnings) at the individual × year level is regressed on cohort ×
year dummies. The residual from that regression is then regressed on pre-MBA characteristics and MBA
performance. Predicted log (annual earnings) is the predicted value from that second regression. The
controls for pre-MBA characteristics are the same as those described in the notes to Table 6. MBA
performance includes overall MBA GPA and fraction of finance classes. “Female, married” (“Male,
married”) is a dummy variable that equals one if the respondent is female (male) and married or living
with a significant other at the time of the survey. “Female, unmarried” is a dummy variable that equals
one if the respondent is female and is neither married nor living with a significant other at the time of the
survey. “Female with spouse as or more educated” (“Male with spouse as or more educated”) is a
dummy variable that equals one if the respondent is a female (male) living with someone that holds
strictly more than a college degree. “Female with less educated spouse” is a dummy variable that equals
one if the respondent is a female living with someone that holds at most a college degree. “Female with
child” (“Male with child”) is a dummy variable that equals one if the respondent is a female (male) who
reports having at least one child at the time of the survey. “Female without child” is a dummy variable
that equals one if the respondent is a female who reports being without child at the time of survey.

Standard errors are in brackets; * significant at 1%.

Notes: Unit of observation is a female survey respondent in a given post-MBA year. Individuals
who had children prior to completing their MBA are not included in the regressions. Each
column corresponds to a different regression. All regressions include cohort × year fixed effects,
person fixed effects and a quadratic in age. Also included in columns (5) to (8) are dummies for
the reasons for choosing current job. Each row reports the coefficient on a dummy variable
indicating the year of first birth or the stated number of years after or before the birth of the first
child. “Not Working: Reasons – Family (Career)” is a dummy variable that equals one if the
respondent reports not working in that year and the reason for not working is family (career)
related. Family reasons include: “Do not need or want to work”; “Home taking care of parents
or other relatives” and “Home raising children.” Career reasons include: “Layoff” and “Suitable
job not available.” “Choosing Job: Reasons – Family (Career)” is a dummy that equals one if the
respondent reports family-related (career-related) reasons for choosing the job she/he is holding
in that year. Family reasons include: “Flexible hours”; “Opportunity to work remotely”;
“Limited travel schedule.” Career reasons include: “Career advancement or broadening”;
“Compensation and other benefits” and “Prestige.” “Leave Job” is a dummy variable that equals
one if the respondent reports leaving a job in that year. “Leave Job: Reasons – Family (Career)”
is a dummy variable that equals one if the respondent reports leaving a job in that year and
indicates family-related (career) reasons for leaving. Family reasons include: “Family reasons”
and “Lifestyle (long hours, inflexible hours, extended travel schedule, etc).” Career reasons
include: “Limited scope for career advancement and broadening” and “Limited scope for future
earnings gain.” Career2 reasons also include: “Job did not match my strengths and interests” and
“Issues with culture/people/environment.”
“Fraction ≤ [30-40] hours” is the fraction of
individual × year observations in that job function where hours worked are below 20, between 20
and 30, or between 30 and 40.” “Fraction ≤ [40-50] hours” is the fraction of individual × year
observations in that job function where hours worked are below 20, between 20 and 30, between
30 and 40 or between 40 and 50. See Appendix A2 for more details. Standard errors (in
brackets) are clustered at the individual level; § significant at 5%; * significant at 1%.

Notes:
The unit of observation is an individual. The table compares mean pre-MBA characteristics and
MBA performance between survey respondents and non-respondents. The last column reports a
p-value on a test of comparison of means between the two groups. The top ten undergraduate
institutions are Caltech, Columbia, Duke, Harvard, MIT, Princeton, Stanford, University of
Chicago, University of Pennsylvania, and Yale; the top 20 undergraduate institutions add to this
group: Brown, Cornell, Dartmouth, Emory, Johns Hopkins, Northwestern, Rice, University of
Notre Dame, Vanderbilt, and Washington University (Source: US News and World Report 2008,

Notes: The unit of observation is a survey respondent. “Ever not working” is defined as having
spent a period of at least six months since MBA graduation without working. “Annual earnings”
is defined as total earnings, before taxes and other deductions, including salary and bonus.
“Annual earnings” is missing when individual is not working. “Hourly wage” is computed by
dividing annual earnings by (weekly hours × 52). All family variables are measured as of the
year the survey was conducted. Spouse with lower education is defined as a spouse with a BA
degree, some college, a high school degree, or some high school.

Notes: The unit of observation is a survey respondent in a given post-MBA year. Hourly wage
is defined as annual earnings divided by (52 × usual weekly hours worked). Pre-MBA
characteristics include: a dummy for U.S. citizen, a “white” dummy, an Asian dummy, a dummy
for “top 10” undergraduate institution, a dummy for “top 10 to 20” undergraduate institution,
undergraduate GPA, a dummy for missing undergraduate GPA, a quadratic in age, verbal GMAT
score, quantitative GMAT score, a dummy for pre-MBA industry and a dummy for pre-MBA job
function. “Any no work spell” is a dummy variable that equals 1 for a given individual in a
given year if the individual experiences a period of at least six months without work between
MBA graduation and that year. “Reason for choosing job” dummies include: Compensation and
other benefits; Career advancement or broadening; Prestige; Culture/people/environment;
Flexible hours; Reasonable total hours per week; Limited travel schedule; Opportunity to work
remotely; Location; Other. “Employer type” dummies include: Public for-profit, < 100
employees; Public for-profit, 100 to 1,000 employees; Public for-profit, 1,000 to 15,000
employees; Public for-profit, > 15,000 employees; Private for-profit, < 100 employees; Private
for-profit, 101 to 1,000 employees; Private for-profit, 1,000 to 15,000 employees; Private forprofit, > 15,000 employees; Not-for-profit; Other. Standard errors (in brackets) are clustered at

Notes: The unit of observation is a female survey respondent in a given post-MBA year. The sample includes those who were married at the
survey date. Each column corresponds to a different regression. All regressions include (cohort × year) dummies, person fixed effects and a
quadratic in age. Each row reports the coefficient on a dummy variable indicating the year of first birth or the number of years after or before the
birth of the first child. Standard errors (in brackets) are clustered at the individual level; § significant at 5%; * significant at 1%.

Notes: The unit of observation is a working stage (stage t) that was immediately preceded by
another working stage (stage t-1). For each observation, we compute the difference between log
(entry salary) in stage t and log (end salary) in stage t-1. All salary figures are in 2006 dollars.
In Panel A, observations are divided based on whether or not the individual had at least one child
when stage t begins. In Panel B, observations are divided based on the reason for choosing job in
stage t, or reason for leaving job in stage t-1.
