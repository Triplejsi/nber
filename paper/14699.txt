ABSTRACT
This paper constructs an index of financial sophistication that, in comprehensive data on Swedish households,
best explains a set of three investment mistakes: underdiversification, risky share inertia, and the tendency
to sell winning stocks and hold losing stocks (the disposition effect). The index of financial sophistication
increases strongly with financial wealth and household size, and to a lesser extent with education and
proxies for financial experience. The index is strongly positively correlated with the share of risky
assets held by a household.

Measuring the Financial Sophistication of Households
By L AURENT E. C ALVET, J OHN Y. C AMPBELL , AND PAOLO S ODINI∗

Many households invest in ways that are hard
to reconcile with standard ﬁnancial theory and that
have been labelled as investment mistakes (Camp­
bell, 2006; Calvet, Campbell and Sodini, henceforth
“CCS”, 2007). There is increasing interest among
household ﬁnance researchers in the concept of ﬁ­
nancial sophistication, deﬁned as the ability of a
household to avoid making such mistakes. A grow­
ing empirical literature documents a cross-sectional
correlation between household characteristics and in­
vestment mistakes. Richer, better educated house­
holds tend to be better diversiﬁed (Marshall Blume
and Irwin Friend, 1975; CCS, 2007; William Goet­
zmann and Alok Kumar, 2008; Annette VissingJorgensen, 2003), display less inertia (Julie Agnew,
Pierluigi Balduzzi, and Annika Sundén, 2003; Yan­
nis Bilias, Dimitris Georgarakos and Michael Halias­
sos, 2008; Campbell, 2006; CCS, 2009; VissingJorgensen, 2002), and have a weaker disposition to
hold losing and sell winning stocks (CCS, 2009;
Ravi Dhar and Ning Zhu, 2006) than other house­
holds. One feature of these earlier papers is that mis­
takes are investigated one at a time, often on a non­
representative sample of households.
In this paper, we jointly analyze several investment
mistakes in a comprehensive, high-quality panel of
household ﬁnances. Because Swedish residents pay
taxes on both income and wealth, Statistics Sweden
has a parliamentary mandate to collect highly detailed

information on the ﬁnances of every household in the
country. We compiled the data supplied by Statistics
Sweden into a panel of the entire population (about
4.8 million households) covering four years (1999­
2002). We observe detailed demographic and income
information, and, most notably, the worldwide assets
owned by each resident on December 31 of each year,
including bank accounts, mutual funds and stocks.
The information is provided for each individual ac­
count or each security referenced by its International
Security Identiﬁcation Number (ISIN). We refer the
reader to CCS (2007, 2009) for a detailed presenta­
tion of this dataset.
We use the Swedish panel to simultaneously in­
vestigate three types of investment mistakes: underdiversiﬁcation, inertia in risk taking, and the dispo­
sition effect in direct stockholdings. Consistent with
earlier research, ﬁnancial wealth, family size and ed­
ucation are found to have a negative impact on the
level of all three mistakes. These ﬁndings motivate
the construction of an index of ﬁnancial sophistica­
tion, which is obtained by regressing the negative of
the mistake vector on a single combination of house­
hold characteristics. The index of ﬁnancial sophistica­
tion increases strongly with log ﬁnancial wealth and
household size, and to a lesser extent with education
and proxies for ﬁnancial experience. We brieﬂy dis­
cuss how sophistication can be estimated in less de­
tailed datasets. An Appendix available online further
presents the dataset and the estimation methodology.

I. Measuring Investment Mistakes
A. Deﬁnitions
Following CCS (2007, 2009), we consider three
classes of liquid ﬁnancial assets, excluding illiquid as­
sets from consideration. Cash consists of bank ac­
count balances and money market funds. Mutual
funds refer to all other funds. Stocks refer to direct
holdings only. We measure a household’s ﬁnancial
wealth as the sum of its holdings in these asset classes.
This deﬁnition focuses on gross wealth and does not
subtract mortgage or other household debt.

PAPERS AND PROCEEDINGS

We deﬁne the following variables for each house­
hold h. The risky portfolio contains stocks and mutual
funds but excludes cash. The risky share wh,t at date t
is the weight of the risky portfolio in ﬁnancial wealth.

B. Investment Mistakes
For every household h, we denote by yh,t =
(yh,t,1 ; yh,t,2 ; yh,t,3 )) a vector of investment mis­
takes at date t. The ﬁrst component yh,t,1 measures
underdiversiﬁcation, the second component yh,t,2
risky share inertia, and the third component yh,t,3 the
disposition effect. The deﬁnition of these variables is
now explained.
Since Sweden is a small and open economy, we
assess the diversiﬁcation of household portfolios rel­
ative to a global equity portfolio, the MSCI World
Index. As in CCS (2007), we assume that assets are
priced on world markets in an international currency
according to a global version of the CAPM. From the
perspective of a Swedish investor, the pricing model
induces a domestic CAPM in which the currencyhedged world index is mean-variance efﬁcient. Be­
cause currency-hedging is typically unavailable to
most retail investors, except perhaps the richest, we
view the unhedged version of the index as a more at­
tainable benchmark. We therefore measure underdi­
versiﬁcation in household h’s risky portfolio by the
relative Sharpe ratio loss
yh,t,1 = 1 −

Sh,t
,
Sm

where Sh,t and Sm respectively denote the Sharpe ra­
tio of the risky portfolio and unhedged index under
the CAPM.
In CCS (2009) we have developed a structural
model of portfolio rebalancing, in which inertia can be
measured by the instrumental variable regression of
risky share changes on household characteristics. We
now construct a proxy that can be readily computed
from individual household data. A useful starting
point is provided by the absolute value of risky share
changes, |wh,t − wh,t−1 |, which Vissing-Jorgensen
(2002) uses as a measure of inertia. We have found in
CCS (2009) that boundary effects are typically more
pronounced in levels than in logs. For this reason, we
proxy inertia by:
yh,t,2 = | ln(wh,t ) − ln(wh,t−1 )|,
that is by the absolute value of risky share changes in

MAY 2009

logs
As in Terrance Odean (1998) and Dhar and Zhu
(2006), our analysis of the disposition effect builds on
the proportion of stock gains realized during the year,
PG Rh,t , and the proportion of stock losses realized,
P L Rh,t . A gain in a particular stock is counted as
being realized if the investor sells some (but not nec­
essarily all) of its holdings of the stock. The house­
hold’s proportion of gains realized, PG Rh,t , is then
deﬁned as the number of winning stocks with realized
gains divided by the total number of winning stocks.
P L Rh,t is deﬁned analogously. The disposition ef­
fect in direct stockholdings is then measured by the
difference:
yh,t,3 = PG Rh,t − P L Rh,t .
We depart in two ways from the earlier literature.
First, because the purchase price is unavailable in our
dataset, we classify a stock as a winner if it has a
higher return than the unhedged world index during
the year, and as a loser if it underperforms the index.
Second, Dhar and Zhu (2006) focus on the set
of households that have experienced both gains and
losses in their stock portfolios. We are concerned that
this restriction might bias the analysis towards house­
holds with large stock portfolios, so we look at a
broader set of households that own stocks at the end
of a given year t and still hold risky assets at the
end of the following year. We extend the deﬁnition
of PG Rh,t and P L Rh,t to this broader set of in­
vestors. If the household does not experience a gain
during the year, we set PG Rh,t equal to the crosssectional mean for households with gains. Similarly
if the household does not experience a loss during the
year, we set P L Rh,t equal to the cross-sectional mean
for households with losses.

II. Empirical Results
A. Unrestricted Regressions
In Table 1, we report the results of the pooled re­
gressions of each investment mistake on household
characteristics:
yh,t, j = β )j xh,t + εh,t, j ,

1 ≤ j ≤ 3,

where all left-hand side and right-hand side variables
are demeaned year by year. The vector x h,t contains
both ﬁnancial and demographic characteristics at the

VOL. 99 NO. 2

end of year t − 1.. The ﬁrst category includes dis­
posable income, contributions to private pension plans
as a fraction of a three-year average of disposable in­
come, log ﬁnancial wealth, log real estate wealth, log
of total liabilities, and dummies for households that
are retired, unemployed, self-employed (“entrepre­
neurs”), and students. The second category includes
age, household size, and dummies for households that
have high-school education, post-high-school educa­
tion, or missing education data (most common among
older and immigrant households) or are immigrants.
Financial wealth has a strikingly negative impact
on all three mistakes. Larger households with higher
education make smaller mistakes, while entrepreneurs
are more prone to all mistakes. Other variables, such
as disposable income and real estate wealth, have a
less stable effect, but this appears to result from the
collinearity of the characteristics x h,t . In the Appen­
dix, we compute the simple correlation between these
regressors and investment mistakes, and ﬁnd that in­
come and real estate wealth are negatively correlated
with all three mistakes.
Investment mistakes themselves are only weakly
correlated across households. The correlation be­
tween underdiversiﬁcation and risky share inertia is
15.5%, the correlation between underdiversiﬁcation
and the disposition effect measure is −10.7%, and the
correlation between risky share inertia and the dispo­
sition effect measure is 5.1%. When we consider in­
stead the ﬁtted values of the mistakes from Table 1,
the correlations are substantially higher, respectively
76.8%, 53.4%, and 80.9%. These ﬁndings suggest
that a single combination of household characteristics
can be used to explain suboptimal investment behav­
ior.

B. Index of Financial Sophistication
We construct an index of ﬁnancial sophistication by
regressing the negative of the mistake vector on a sin­
gle linear combination of household characteristics:

(1)

−yh,t,1

=

−yh,t,2

=

−yh,t,3

=

(β ) xh,t ) + ε h,t,1 ,

γ 2 (β ) x h,t ) + ε h,t,2 ,
γ 3 (β ) x h,t ) + ε h,t,3 .

We interpret (β ) x h,t ) as an index of ﬁnancial sophisti­
cation. Note that we have multiplied the mistake vec­
tor by −1 on the left-hand side, so that households
with a higher index tend to make lower mistakes. The
index is multiplied by proportionality constants γ 2

3

and γ 3 in the last two equations. The proportionality
constant is normalized to unity in the ﬁrst equation.
In Table 2, panel A, we report the results of the
nonlinear least squares estimation of β in (1). House­
holds with high ﬁnancial wealth, education and family
size achieve a high index of sophistication. In Table
2, panel B, we also report the proportionality coefﬁ­
cients γ 2 and γ 3 . They are both positive, which con­
ﬁrms that the index is associated with a lower level of
all three mistakes. We observe that the proportional­
ity restriction causes only a slight loss in explanatory
power for underdiversiﬁcation and inertia, but a more
serious loss for the disposition effect compared to the
unrestricted regressions reported in Table 1.
The correlation between the sophistication index
and the risky share is equal to 0.35. This result con­
ﬁrms the ﬁnding in CCS (2007) that more sophis­
ticated agents tend to invest more aggressively and
make smaller mistakes.

C. Robustness Checks
In the online Appendix, we have veriﬁed the ro­
bustness of our results to alternative assumptions
about the household sample and the measurement of
ﬁnancial mistakes. First, we obtain similar results in a
smaller subsample containing stockholders with both
gains and losses in their stock portfolios, as in Dhar
and Zhu (2006).
Second, we have considered several alternative
measure of inertia. Risky share changes yield broadly
similar, if slightly weaker, results in levels than in
logs. General equilibrium considerations imply that
changes in the target risky share are potentially impor­
tant (CCS 2009). We have considered several proxies
for the target, and have found that our main results are
remarkably robust to these alternative measures.
Third, in the computation of the disposition ef­
fect, we have classiﬁed winners and losers according
to their absolute performance during the year, rather
than their performance relative to the world index.
Since absolute gains are relatively rare during the se­
vere bear market of our sample period, we conﬁne at­
tention to stockholders with both absolute gains and
losses in their stock portfolios, and obtain similar re­
sults. Our results are also robust to counting a gain
as realized only if the household fully disposes of the
corresponding stock during the year.
Finally, the household-level Sharpe ratios used in
Tables 1 and 2 are computed on the highly disaggre­
gated asset-level data provided by Statistics Sweden.

PAPERS AND PROCEEDINGS

In other countries, however, researchers often have
access to more limited information on household ﬁ­
nances, and must typically rely on statistics such as
the number of stocks, the number of funds, and the
share of funds in the risky portfolio. In the Appendix,
we have investigated how these measures relate to the
Sharpe ratio. The share of funds in the risky portfolio
appears to be a reasonable diversiﬁcation proxy, with
a 0.49 cross-sectional correlation with the Sharpe ra­
tio. Furthermore, when we use this proxy in the re­
gression of ﬁnancial mistakes on characteristics, we
obtain results that are broadly consistent with the re­
sults obtained with the Sharpe ratio.1 This is encour­
aging since the share of funds in the risky portfolio is
readily available in a variety of datasets.

III. Summary and Conclusions
In this paper, we have conﬁrmed earlier evidence
that richer, educated households of larger size are less
prone to making ﬁnancial mistakes than other house­
holds. These results have motivated the construction
of a single index of ﬁnancial sophistication that best
explains a set of three investment mistakes. The in­
dex of ﬁnancial sophistication increases strongly with
ﬁnancial wealth and household size, and to a lesser
extent with education and proxies for ﬁnancial expe­
rience, but is lower for self-employed and immigrant
households.
It is of course difﬁcult to unambiguously estab­
lish that any behavior is a mistake, especially when
one considers the possibility of nonstandard prefer­
ences. Douglas Bernheim and Antonio Rangel (2007)
do consider both possibilities and acknowledge that
mistakes can indeed occur. Our empirical ﬁnding that
poorer, less educated, immigrant households are more
prone to joint deviations from rational benchmarks
makes it more plausible that these deviations are in­
deed mistakes.
A more direct approach is to correlate investors’
behavior with their cognitive ability and ﬁnancial lit­
1 Variables such as the number of stocks or the number
of funds, however, are poor diversiﬁcation proxies, as evi­
denced by their small or even slightly negative correlation
with the risky portfolio’s Sharpe ratio. We have also con­
sidered a more elaborate imputation method based on the
household’s number of stocks and funds, the share of funds
in the risky portfolio, as well as the average return, standard
deviation, and correlation of stocks and funds. This method
performs well but is only a very modest improvement over
the share of funds.

eracy (e.g. Maarten van Rooij, Annamaria Lusardi
and Rob Alessie, 2007). We have not pursued this ap­
proach but believe that this is a promising direction
for future research.
Another way to detect if an observed behavior is
a mistake is to ask whether a household with a high
propensity to make mistakes understands that it has
such a propensity and alters its behavior as a result.
We have reported a strong positive correlation be­
tween a household’s sophistication index and its share
of risky assets. This correlation is consistent with the
intuition developed in CCS (2007) that a household
is willing to take ﬁnancial risk when it is conﬁdent in
its understanding of asset markets and the basic pre­
cepts of investing. In a recent and related contribu­
tion, Luigi Guiso, Paola Sapienza and Luigi Zingales
(2007) emphasize the role of trust as a key determi­
nant of participation and the risky share. The detailed
analysis of these closely related views of risk-taking
is left open for further research.

Sophistication of Households”∗

First version: January 2009

1. Data Description and Deﬁnitions
Swedish households pay taxes on both income and wealth. For this reason, the national
Statistics Central Bureau (SCB), also known as Statistics Sweden, has a parliamentary
mandate to collect highly detailed information on the ﬁnances of every household in
the country. We compiled the data supplied by SCB into a panel covering four years
(1999-2002) and all Swedish residents (about 4.8 million households). The information
available on each resident can be grouped into three main categories: demographic
characteristics, income, and disaggregated wealth.
Demographic information includes age, gender, marital status, nationality, birth­
place, education, and place of residence. The household head is deﬁned as the individ­
ual with the highest income. The education variable includes high school and post-high

is provided for each individual account or each security referenced by its International
Security Identiﬁcation Number (ISIN). The database also records contributions made
during the year to private pension savings, as well as debt outstanding at year end and
interest paid during the year.
Following Calvet, Campbell, and Sodini (henceforth “CCS”, 2007), we measure a
household’s total ﬁnancial wealth as the sum of its holdings in these asset classes, ex­
cluding from consideration illiquid assets such as real estate or consumer durables, de­
ﬁned contribution retirement accounts, capital insurance products that combine return
guarantees with risky asset holdings, and directly held bonds. Also, our measure of
wealth is gross wealth and does not subtract mortgage or other household debt. CCS
(2007) summarize the relative magnitudes of all these components of Swedish household
balance sheets.
The results presented in this paper are based on households that exist throughout
the 1999-2002 period. We impose no constraint on the participation status of these
households, but require that they satisfy the following ﬁnancial requirements at the
end of each year. First, disposable income must be strictly positive and the three-year
rolling average must be at least 1,000 Swedish kronor ($113). Second, ﬁnancial wealth
must be no smaller than 3,000 kronor ($339). For computational convenience, we have
selected a random panel of 100,000 households from the ﬁltered population. Unless
stated otherwise, all the results in the paper and appendix are based on this ﬁxed
subsample.

2. Additional Results on the Regressions Reported in the Main Text
We begin by reporting additional results on the regressions presented in Tables 1 and
2 of the main text. In Table A1, we report the cross-sectional correlation of investment
mistakes in the population of households considered in Tables 1 and 2. In the top left
corner, we consider the correlation of observed mistakes. We ﬁnd that risky share
inertia has a slight positive correlation with underdiversiﬁcation and the disposition
eﬀect, while the correlation between underdiversiﬁcation and the disposition eﬀect is
slightly negative. In the bottom right corner, we report the correlation of ﬁtted mistakes,
which are computed using the unrestricted regression coeﬃcients reported in Table 1
of the main text. All three correlations are strongly positive, ranging between 53.4%
and 80.9%. This suggests that it is possible to construct a single index of ﬁnancial
sophistication.
In Table A2, we report the simple correlation between characteristics and ﬁtted mis­
takes. The ﬁtted values are again computed using the unrestricted regression coeﬃcients
reported in Table 1. Disposable income, private pension premia, real estate wealth, the

2

post-high school dummy, and most strikingly ﬁnancial wealth are all negatively cor­
related with the three mistakes. We conversely obtain positive correlations between
mistakes and the retirement or entrepreneurs dummies. Thus, the collinearity of regres­
sors seems to explain apparent instability in the signs of some coeﬃcients reported in
Table 1.
In Table A3, we report the restricted regression coeﬃcients of investment mistakes
on household characteristics. The results are derived from Table 2 in the main text, and
have the advantage of being directly comparable to Table 1. Log ﬁnancial wealth has
approximately the same coeﬃcients as the ones obtained in the unrestricted regression,
while larger diﬀerences are apparent for other regressors.

3. Robustness Checks
3.1. Disposition Eﬀect
Stockholders with Both Gains and Losses. In Tables A4-A6, we reestimate the
sophistication regressions on the set of participating stockholders with both gains and
losses in their stock portfolios. Dhar and Zhu (2006) impose a similar requirement on
the set of households they consider in their analysis. As in the main text, we classify
a stock as a winner if its performance during the year is higher than the unhedged
version of the MSCI world index. We verify in Table A4 that ﬁnancial wealth, and
to a lesser extent household size and education, have a negative impact on all three
mistakes, and we observe in Table A5 that the ﬁtted values of investments mistakes
have high positive correlations. As is apparent in Table A6, the reduction of the R2
coeﬃcient in the restricted regression is modest for underdiversiﬁcation and inertia,
but more pronounced for the disposition eﬀect. The index of ﬁnancial sophistication
increases with ﬁnancial wealth, household size and education, but tends to be lower for
immigrants, entrepreneurs and the unemployed. Thus, the results reported in the main
text are robust to the choice of this alternative subsample.
Losers and Winners Deﬁned by Absolute Performance During the Year. In
Tables A7-A9, we classify a stock as a winner if it has a positive return during the
year, and as a loser otherwise. We reestimate the sophistication regressions and mistake
correlations on the set of participating stockholders with both gains and losses in their
stock portfolios. Tables A7-A9 show that the results of the main text are robust to the
choice of alternative stock classiﬁcation and household subsample.
Disposition Eﬀect Computed Using Full Sales Only. In Tables A10-A12, we
investigate the robustness of our results when the measure of the disposition eﬀect only
takes full sales into account. We focus on participating stockholders who sell at least
3

one stock (either partially or fully) and experience both gains and losses in their stock
portfolios during the year. Gains and losses are calculated with respect to the unhedged
world index. We verify in Tables A10-A12 that the results reported in the main text are
robust to considering only full sales in the disposition eﬀect measure.
3.2. Risky Share Inertia
We now consider two alternative measure of risky share inertia.
Risky Share Changes in Levels. In Tables A13-A15, we proxy inertia by the absolute
value of risky share changes in levels, |wh,t+1 −wh,t |. We obtain broadly similar, if slightly
weaker, results than in logs.
Adjustment Model. In CCS (2009), we have introduced an adjustment model of the
risky share. For every household h, we write the period-t + 1 risky share, wh,t+1 , as the
p
d
, and target share, wh,t+1
:
weighted average of the households’s passive share, wh,t+1
p
d
ln(wh,t+1 ) = (1 − φh ) ln(wh,t+1
) + φh ln(wh,t+1
),
p
The passive share wh,t+1
is the proportion of risky assets in the complete portfolio at
the end of year t + 1 if the household passively holds its year-t portfolio for an entire
year. The passive share can be readily computed for every household. By contrast, the
d
is unobserved and is estimated, along with the adjustment coeﬃcient φh ,
target wh,t+1
by instrumental variable regression in CCS (2009).
We now use the adjustment model to deﬁne a proxy for inertia that can be read­
ily computed for every household. The adjustment equation implies that the inertia
measure 1 − φh satisﬁes

1 − φh =

d
ln(wh,t+1 ) − ln(wh,t+1
)

p
d
ln(wh,t+1
) − ln(wh,t+1
)

.

(3.1)

The numerator can be decomposed as follows:
d
d
d
ln(wh,t+1 ) − ln(wh,t+1
) = ∆ ln(wh,t+1 ) − ∆ ln(wh,t+1
) + ln(wh,t ) − ln(wh,t
).

We classify households into bins of the initial risky share wh,t , and proxy the target
d
change ∆ ln(wh,t+1
) by the equal-weighted average of the risky share change among
d , then
households in the same bin, ∆Th,t+1 . If we also assume that wh,t = wh,t
d
) ≈ ∆ ln(wh,t+1 ) − ∆Th,t+1 .
ln(wh,t+1 ) − ln(wh,t+1

4

d
Let ph,t+1 = ln(wh,t+1 ) − ln(wh,t+1
) denote the passive change. The denominator of
(3.1) can similarly be rewritten as:
p
d
d
d
) − ln(wh,t+1
) = ph,t+1 − ∆ ln(wh,t+1
) + ln(wh,t ) − ln(wh,t
)
ln(wh,t+1

≈ ph,t+1 − ∆Th,t+1 .

Given these approximations, we deﬁne the following proxy for the inertia coeﬃcient:
¯
¯
¯ ∆ ln(wh,t+1 ) − ∆Th,t+1 ¯
¯
¯.
yh,t,2 = ¯
¯
ph,t+1 − ∆Th,t+1

Since changes in the target are poorly estimated, we take absolute values and winsorize
the ratio to reduce noise.1
In Tables A16-A18, we reestimate the sophistication regressions and mistake corre­
lations when the inertia coeﬃcient yh,t,2 is winsorized at the 95th percentile. The results
are broadly consistent with the ﬁndings of the main text. Signiﬁcance levels, correla­
tions, and R2 coeﬃcients are lower than in Tables 1 and 2 because of the noisiness of
this alternative measure.
In Tables A19-A21, we conﬁrm this interpretation by winsorizing the inertia coef­
ﬁcient at the 90th percentile. The reduction in noise leads to higher signiﬁcance levels
and R2 , as one would expect. The correlation coeﬃcients are slightly lower, however,
presumably because winsorization reduces the covariance between the inertia measure
and other mistakes. Overall, this analysis conﬁrms that the results in the main text are
robust to the choice of alternative measures of inertia based on the adjustment model.
Market Measure of Inertia. Consider a general equilibrium economy in which the
representative agent holds the market portfolio. At the end of the following year, her
new target risky share must coincide with her passive risky share:
ωp (wh,t ; rm,t+1 ) =

wh,t (1 + rm,t+1 )
.
1 + rf,t + wh,t (rm,t+1 − rf,t )

These considerations lead us to proxy household inertia by the market measure:
yh,t,2 = | ln(wh,t+1 ) − ln ωp (wh,t ; rm,t+1 )|,
1

The following example illustrates why the measure of inertia is quite noisy. Consider a closed
economy in which the representative agent passively holds the market portfolio. The numerator and
denominator of
∆ ln(wh,t+1 ) − ∆Th,t+1
(3.2)
ph,t+1 − ∆Th,t+1
are then both equal to zero. The sign and magnitude of the ratio are thus unstable for households
that are close to the mean. Since we have shown in CCS (2009) that the inertia coeﬃcient is contained
between 0 and 1 for almost all households, we reduce noise by taking absolute values and winsorizing
the upper tail of yh,t,2 .

5

where rm,t+1 is the return on the unhedged world index. yh,t,2 is the distance between
the actual risky share, wh,t+1 , and a proxy for the target, ω p (wh,t ; rm,t+1 ).
In Tables A22-A24, we reestimate the sophistication regressions when inertia is
proxied by the market measure. The results are consistent, if slightly weaker, than
the estimates reported in the main text.

4. Measuring Diversiﬁcation on Less Detailed Datasets
We have hitherto computed household-level Sharpe ratios from the highly disaggregated
asset-level data provided by Statistics Sweden. In other countries, however, researchers
often have access to more limited information on household ﬁnances, and must rely on
statistics such as the number of stocks, the number of funds, and the share of funds in
the risky portfolio, as diversiﬁcation proxies. In Table A25, we report the cross-sectional
correlation between these proxies and the actual Sharpe ratio in our dataset. Speciﬁcally,
for every household h, we consider the number of stocks nh in the risky portfolio, the
number of risky funds mh , the total number of risky assets nh + mh , the share of risky
assets in funds Fh , and the weighted number of risky assets: (1 − Fh )nh + Fh mh . We
also consider a more elaborate imputation method of the Sharpe ratio, which is based
on the household’s number of stocks and funds, the share of funds in the risky portfolio,
as well as the average return, standard deviation and correlation of stocks and funds.
The exact deﬁnition of the imputed Sharpe ratio is provided at the end of the section.
The share of funds in the risky portfolio is a reasonable diversiﬁcation proxy, with
a 0.49 cross-sectional correlation with the Sharpe ratio. The imputed Sharpe ratio per­
forms well but provides only a tiny improvement in the correlation compared to the
share of funds. Variables such as the number of stocks or the number of risky assets,
however, are poor diversiﬁcation proxies, as evidenced by their small or slightly negative
correlation with the risky portfolio’s Sharpe ratio. In Tables A26-A28, we reestimate
the sophistication regressions when the share of funds in the risky portfolio is used as
a diversiﬁcation proxy. The results are qualitatively similar to the ones obtained in the
main text.
In Tables A29-A31, we reestimate the sophistication regressions based on the im­
puted Sharpe ratio. The results are consistent with the ones obtained with the fund
share and the actual Sharpe ratio. Predicted correlations and R2 coeﬃcients, however,
are substantially larger than with the Sharpe ratio and the fund share, which suggests
that these estimates should be interpreted with caution when using the imputed the
Sharpe ratio in other datasets.
Overall, the share of funds in the risky portfolio appears to be a reasonable proxy for
risky portfolio diversiﬁcation. This is encouraging news for household ﬁnance researchers
since these measures are readily available in many countries.

4.1. Imputed Sharpe Ratio
As in CCS (2007), we assume that assets are priced on world markets in dollars according
to a global version of the CAPM. From the perspective of a Swedish investor, the
pricing model induces a domestic CAPM in which the currency-hedged world index is
mean-variance eﬃcient. Because currency-hedging is typically unavailable to most retail
investors, except perhaps the richest, we view the unhedged version of the index as more
attainable. The computation of the imputed Sharpe ratio then proceeds as follows.
• The CAPM implies that the excess return on the equal-weighted Swedish index
has mean μSI = 7.35% and volatility σSI = 31.2%.
• The excess return on a stock held by a Swedish household has mean μD = μSI ,
average volatility σ D = 71.61%, and average pairwise correlation ρ = 8%. The
computation of σ D and ρ is based on the variance-covariance matrix of excess
returns implied by the CAPM.
• The unhedged world index has expected excess return μm = 5.52%, volatility
σ m = 15.98%, and Sharpe ratio Sm = 34.56% (from the CAPM).
• The average correlation between an individual stock and the unhedged index is
ρ∗ = 28.32%.
We now consider the household’s stock and fund portfolios. The household’s stock
portfolio yields the excess return:
rh,D,t

nh
1 X
=
ri,t ,
nh
i=1

2 [1 + (n − 1)ρ] /n . We assume that fund
which has mean μD and variance σ 2h,D = σ D
h
h
holdings are invested in the unhedged version of the world index.
Under these assumptions, the excess return on the risky portfolio,

rh,t = Dh,t rh,D,t + (1 − Dh,t )rm,t ,
2 σ 2 +(1−D )2 σ 2 +
has mean E(rh,t ) = Dh,t μD +(1−Dh,t )μm and variance σ 2h,t = Dh,t
h,t
m
h,D
∗
2Dh,t (1 − Dh,t )ρ σ m σ D . We therefore proxy the household’s Sharpe ratio by:

Dh,t μD + (1 − Dh,t )μm
ISh,t = h
i1/2 .
2
2
2
2
∗
Dh,t σ h,D + (1 − Dh,t ) σ m + 2Dh,t (1 − Dh,t )ρ σ m σ D

The corresponding underdiversiﬁcation measure is 1 − ISh,t /Sm .

Disposition Effect

Notes: This table reports the pooled regressions of investment mistakes on household characteristics. The estimation is based on households that hold
stocks at t, experience both gains and losses in their stock portfolios between t and t+1, still hold risky assets at t+1, and for which the immigration
dummy is available. Underdiversification is measured by the Sharpe ratio loss relative to the unhedged world index under the CAPM. Risky share inertia
is proxied by the absolute value of changes in the log risky share. The disposition effect measure is the difference between the proportion of gains
realized and the proportion of losses realized during the year. A stock is classified as a gain if it outperforms the unhedged world index during the year,
and as a loss otherwise. Mistakes are expressed in percentage points. All mistakes and characteristics are demeaned year by year, and continuous
characteristics are also standardized year by year.

Notes: This table reports the pooled restricted regression of the negative of investment mistakes on
household characteristics. The measure of each mistake and the set of households are the same as in Tables
A4 and A5. In Panel A, we compute the coefficients of the sophistication index, their t-statistics, as well as the
simple correlation of the index with each characteristic. In Panel B, we report the proportionality coefficient of
risky share inertia and the disposition effect measure, and the adjusted R2 of all three mistakes. The
proportionality coefficient of underdiversification is by definition equal to unity and is not reported. Mistakes are
expressed in percentage points. All mistakes and characteristics are demeaned year by year, and continuous
characteristics are also standardized year by year.

Disposition Effect

Notes: This table reports the pooled regressions of investment mistakes on household characteristics when a stock is classified as a winner if it has a
positive return during the year, and is otherwise classified as a loser. Underdiversification is measured by the Sharpe ratio loss relative to the unhedged
world index under the CAPM. Risky share inertia is proxied by the absolute value of changes in the log risky share. The disposition effect measure is the
difference between the proportion of gains realized and the proportion of losses realized during the year. The estimation is based on households that
hold stocks at t, experience both gains and losses in their stock portfolios between t and t+1, still hold risky assets at t+1, and for which the immigration
dummy is available. Mistakes are expressed in percentage points. All mistakes and characteristics are demeaned year by year, and continuous
characteristics are also standardized year by year.

Disposition Effect

Notes: This table reports the pooled regressions of investment mistakes on household characteristics when the disposition effect measure only takes full
sales into account. Underdiversification is measured by the Sharpe ratio loss relative to the unhedged world index under the CAPM. Risky share inertia
is proxied by the absolute value of changes in the log risky share. The disposition effect measure is the difference between the proportion of gains
realized and the proportion of losses realized during the year, and only full sales are taken into account. A stock is classified as a gain if it outperforms
the unhedged world index during the year, and as a loss otherwise. The estimation is based on households that hold stocks at t, sell at least one stock
and experience both gains and losses in their stock portfolios between t and t+1, still hold risky assets at t+1, and for which the immigration dummy is
available. Mistakes are expressed in percentage points. All mistakes and characteristics are demeaned year by year, and continuous characteristics are
also standardized year by year.

The disposition effect measure is the difference between the proportion of gains realized and the proportion of losses realized during the year. A stock is
classified as a gain if it outperforms the unhedged world index during the year, and as a loss otherwise. The estimation is based on participants at t and
t+1 with direct stockholdings at t for which the immigration dummy is available. Mistakes are expressed in percentage points. All mistakes and

from the adjustment model winsorized at the 95th percentile. Underdiversification is measured by the Sharpe ratio loss relative to the unhedged world
index under the CAPM. The disposition effect measure is the difference between the proportion of gains realized and the proportion of losses realized
during the year. A stock is classified as a gain if it outperforms the unhedged world index during the year, and as a loss otherwise. The estimation is
based on participants at t and t+1 with direct stockholdings at t for which the immigration dummy is available. Mistakes are expressed in percentage
points. All mistakes and characteristics are demeaned year by year, and continuous characteristics are also standardized year by year.

Notes: This table reports the pooled regressions of investment mistakes on household characteristics when risky share inertia is proxied by the market
measure. Underdiversification is measured by the Sharpe ratio loss relative to the unhedged world index under the CAPM. The market measure of risky
share inertia is the absolute value of the difference between the household’s log risky share, ln(wh,t+1 ), and its log passive share if it holds the unhedged
world index during the year, ln(ωp(wh,t,rm,t+1)). The disposition effect measure is the difference between the proportion of gains realized and the proportion
of losses realized during the year. A stock is classified as a gain if it outperforms the unhedged world index during the year, and as a loss otherwise. The
estimation is based on participants at t and t+1 with direct stockholdings at t for which the immigration dummy is available. Mistakes are expressed in
percentage points. All mistakes and characteristics are demeaned year by year, and continuous characteristics are also standardized year by year.

Disposition Effect

Notes: This table reports the pooled regressions of investment mistakes on household characteristics when underdiversification is proxied by the share
of direct stockholdings in the risky portfolio. Risky share inertia is proxied by the absolute value of changes in the log risky share. The disposition effect
measure is the difference between the proportion of gains realized and the proportion of losses realized during the year. A stock is classified as a gain if
it outperforms the unhedged world index during the year, and as a loss otherwise. The estimation is based on participants at t and t+1 with direct
stockholdings at t for which the immigration dummy is available. Mistakes are expressed in percentage points. All mistakes and characteristics are
demeaned year by year, and continuous characteristics are also standardized year by year.

Notes: This table reports the cross-sectional correlation of investment mistakes. The measure of each mistake and the set of households are the same as in Table A26. In the top left
panel we compute the correlation of observed mistakes, in the bottom right panel the correlation of predicted mistakes, and in the bottom left panel the correlation between predicted and
observed mistakes. All mistakes are demeaned year by year, and predicted mistakes are computed using the pooled regressions reported in Table A26.

Notes: This table reports the pooled restricted regression of the negative of investment mistakes on household
characteristics. The measure of each mistake and the set of households are the same as in Tables A26 and
A27. In Panel A, we compute the coefficients of the sophistication index, their t-statistics, as well as the simple
correlation of the index with each characteristic. In Panel B, we report the proportionality coefficient of risky
share inertia and the disposition effect measure, and the adjusted R2 of all three mistakes. The proportionality
coefficient of underdiversification is by definition equal to unity and is not reported. Mistakes are expressed in
percentage points. All mistakes and characteristics are demeaned year by year, and continuous
characteristics are also standardized year by year.

Disposition Effect

Notes: This table reports the pooled regressions of investment mistakes on household characteristics when underdiversification is proxied by the
imputed Sharpe ratio loss relative to the unhedged index under the CAPM. Risky share inertia is proxied by the absolute value of changes in the log
risky share. The disposition effect measure is the difference between the proportion of gains realized and the proportion of losses realized during the
year. A stock is classified as a gain if it outperforms the unhedged world index during the year, and as a loss otherwise. The estimation is based on
participants at t and t+1 with direct stockholdings at t for which the immigration dummy is available. Mistakes are expressed in percentage points. All
mistakes and characteristics are demeaned year by year, and continuous characteristics are also standardized year by year.
