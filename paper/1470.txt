Developing Country Debt and the
Market Value of Large Commercial Banks
ABSTRACT

The effect on coinmerqial banks of exposure to large amounts of developing

country debt has been a topic of increasing concern In recent years. Fear of
default on the part of t1e debtor countries has led to fears for the solvency of
the creditor banks since in nany

cases

the total of outstanding exposure to

risky debtors exceeds the entire capital base of the

banks involved. The paper

presents a first effort towards measuring the effects of LDC debt exposure on
the market value of large comniercial value banks in the United States. Our
results indicate that exposure to developing country debt has exerted a
measurable and significant negative effect on the ratio of market to book value
for these banks.

valuation of bank stock. This paper presents a preliminary effort toward the
goal, investigating the effects of debt exposure on the ratio of market to
book value of the common stock of large commercial banks in the United States.

The Market Value to Book Value Ratio

Unlike the Mexican bond shown in Figure 1, seasoned commercial bank loans

to developing countries are not traded in organized markets. It is therefore
not possible to infer the current market valuation of such claims from

observed trading prices. There is some anecdotal evidexce from the Euromark—
ets that some second—hand tra4ing between banks does exist, and that these
so—called "silent subparticipations" on Latin American debt have been selling

at discounts of ten to twenty—five percent.3 The pricing of new loans to LDCs
also does not give a good indication of market discounts since in the major
crisis cases (like Brazil and Mexico) no new creditors are making loans, and
existing debt is being rolled over at below—market terms.4

Our strategy is to infer the market valuation of existing loans from

changes in bank stock prices. As a rule, existing claims on debtor countries
are carried at par in assessing the book value of commercial banks. Thus,

despite re—schedulings and the risk of default, a l claim on Brazil is car-

ried at 1 book value. The market value of the commercial bank holding this
claim, however, should be below book value to the extent that the risks on the
loan reduce the value of the claim. Thus, one determinant of the book value
(BV) to market value (MV) ratio should be the extent of exposure to problematic LDC debt.

In this preliminary investigation, we take a standard equation for By/MV
from the literature, and add LDC debt exposure (EX) relative to book value, as

—3-an explanatory variable. The regression equation is

MV/BY = f3Z — aEX/BV

(1)

where Z is a vector of traditional variables in bank stock pricing. A significant positive coefficient for a will indicate that bank stocks are
reduced in value as a function of their exposure to the LDCs.

Probably the most relevant previous study for our

work is Kamath (1980),

who analyses the determinants of the market to book value ratio for 52
in

1974,

1975

banks

and 1976. A variety of variables prove significant: beta,

volume of trading, growth in

earnings,

and payout ratio, as well as a capital

adequacy variable in one year. This variable is interesting in that Kamath
has utilized a capital adequacy test formulated by Vojta (1973) in which the

ratio

of loan loss chargeoffs to capital is used instead of the more commonly

used asset/capital ratios. The fact that this variable is significant only in
1974 (the year of the Franki in National failure) seems to indicate that inves—

tor

perceptions may be conditioned by highly visible events affecting bank

capitaL Therefore, in the context of exposure to developing country debt,
this result suggests that there may be a similar significance of capital adequacy

variables during periods of investor uncertainty such as the period fol-

lowing August 1982.

Using Kamath's framework, we added to his list of variables the LDC exposure variable. Our sample on LDC

debt

exposure includes 62 commercial banks

in the United States (listed in the Appendix), observed on a quarterly basis
from September 1982 through June 1983. Information on levels of outstanding
exposure to particular countries was obtained from quarterly reports and 10—K

— 4-.
forms submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission. It should be noted
that small levels of LX exposure are usually not reported to the SEC, as
banks are not required to present disaggregated data of exposure to individual
countries of amounts to less than 0.75%

of

total outstandings. We limited our

focus to exposure to five Latin American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Mex-

ico, chile, and Venezuela. These are by far the largest debtors (with
percent of the LDC loans

of BIS banks as of end—1982), and are the only coun-

with a comprehensive representation on the 10—K forms. All

of

Table 1 provides some summary measures of interest from the data set. We

show in the table the average exposure and MV/By ratios for the entire sample,

and for the most and least heavily exposed banks in the sample. The heavily
exposed banks all have an

least
the

exposure

ratio of about 2,0 or higher, while the

exposed banks in the sample have no exposure. For all four quarters,

heavily exposed banks have a considerably lower MV/lW ratio, and the gap

between the two sets of banks widens considerably in 1983:1 and 1983:11.
Thus, it will not be surprising to find a significant effect of EX/BV on
MV/BV, and perhaps an effect that grows over time. On

period.

Following the previous work on

the capital adequacy of commercial banks

above, several different formulations were tested. As a first step,

the formulation used by Kamath was repeated for the four quarters from

DEVFLOPING COUNTHY DEBT AND THE MARKET VALUE OF LARGE (X)MMERCIAL BANKS

The effect on commercial banks of exposure to large amounts of developing
country debt has been a topic of increasing concern in recent years. Fear of
default on the part of the debtor countries has lead to fears for the solvency
of the creditor banks since in many cases the total of outstanding exposure to

risky debtors
just

exceeds the entire capital

base of the banks involved. To take

one example, Citicorp's claims on Brazil alone amounted to 116% of bank

equity at year end 1982.1 Thus, it is clear that considerations of exposure to
LDC debt could potentially have quite a large effect on the relative values of
bank stocks.

It has long been acknowledged that the events of August 1982, in which
the Mexican payments crisis focused attention on this problem, helped to
stimulate a discount of

the value of developing country

national capital markets. Figure 1,
of

obligations in inter-

showing the spread in yield to maturity

a Mexican bond over that of a relatively safe World Bank bond, shows that

this discounting was quite substantial, and that the timing of the effect
corresponds

closely to the events of August 1982. Bank stock

analysts

have

paid close attention to the level of exposure to developing country debt in

analyses of bank stocks in U.S. securities markets, For example,

Line

the Value

Investment Survey stated, "Stocks of major international banks such as

Citicorp have lately been under pressure because of adverse news reports about
Brazil.

However, in spite of this recognition of the importance of foreign debt
in this context, no attempt has been made to quantify its effects on the

out a high percentage of earnings as dividends rather than retaining them

for reinvestment. In theory, this should not make any difference to the
investor since retained earnings should be capitalized in the price of

the stock. In fact, a good case could be made for preferring

payout

ratios if the bank's rate of return on reinvested profits is higher than

the investor's next best alternative. Nevertheless, this variable has
been included both because payout may affect investor perceptions regardless of its actual importance and also to facilitate comparison of the
results presented here with those of Kamath;

vey. This variables was included as a proxy for systematic risk;

7. Exposure Variable (EX/BV) —

This variable was constructed as the s

of outstanding exposure to Argentina, Brazil, Qtile, Mexico and Venezuela
divided

by total book value.

The above formulation

utilizes

a very specific class of assets (claims on

the LDCs) as an explanatory variable. We also felt that an additional set of
regressions using more aggregate capital asset ratios, as a measure of bank
capital

adequacy would be of some interest. Of the various capital adequacy

variables tested, only one proved significant, total assets divided by the
total book value of common equity plus the value of preferred equity (KAIJQ2).
Regression Results

The first of the regressions discussed above, in which the

developing

country exposure variable is used along with a vector of additional variables
to explain variation in the market/book value ratio, was performed for each of

—5—
September 1982 through June 1983, with the addition of EX/BV. In these
regressions for following variables were chosen to explain variations in the
market/book value ratio:

1. Rate of Return on Book Value (RORBV) —
fitability

This

variable, measures the pro-

of the bank and would be expected to have a positive relation—

ship with the market/book value ratio;
2. Earnings Stability (ERST) — This variable was constructed in a two—

step

process. First net current operating

regressed

earnings for each bank were

on a time trend. Next, the variance of the regression was

divided by the mean value of earnings over the period to provide a meas-

ure of the stability of bank earnings. It is expected that this variable
should have a negative relation with the dependent variable;

3. Growth Rate of Book Value (BVGRS) —
for

This

variable is used as a proxy

expected future growth. Insofar as recent experience provides an

accurate measure of such expectations, this variable would be expected to

enter
months

with a positive sign. Average annual growth rates over the thirty

4.

preceding each observation were used;

Common

Stock Trading Value (TRDVL) — This variable was usec1 as a

proxy for the marketability of the stock. It is assumed that a larger
trading volume would increase the liquidity and hence the desirability of

a given stock. Thus, this variable is expected to enter with a positive
Si gn;

5.

Payout

Ratio (POUT) — Many

observers have maintained that investors

have a preference f or current income. That is, they prefer banks

to pay

1983.

The results are

presented in Table 2. As can be seen, all variables enter with the expected
signs with the exception of beta and the payout ratio, which switch signs in

one period but are not significant. In general, the most important determinants of the market/book value ratio over this period appear to be the rate
of return on book value, the volume of common stock trading and exposure to

developing country debt. This last variable enters negatively in all four
regressions and is significant in all but the third period. The magnitude of
the coefficients indicates that developing country debt was discounted significantly during this period.

To test for the possibility that the bulk of the effect of developing
country exposure on the market/book value ratio might be felt after the issue
of quarterly reports containing such information rather than contemporaneously, the above regressions were rerun using the closing market/book value
ratio for the quarter after that corresponding to the independent variables.
In effect, this is an indirect indication of the extent to which such quarterly reports contain new information which is acted on subsequent to publica-

tion. As can be seen in Table 3, this formulation results in a comparable R2
together with considerably greater levels of significance for estimates of the

coefficient of LDCEX. It is interesting to note that both the magnitude and
the level of significance of this coefficient increase for later periods.
This seems to indicate that investor perceptions show a "learning effect" as
the full implications of the developing country debt crisis became apparent.

A pooled regression over all four quarters were performed and the results

are presented in Table 4. This regression also indicates a substantial

discount of the value of developing country obligations over the period. Also

presented in Table 4 are the results of a pooled regression in which dummies
were used to allow unrestricted estimation of coefficients for the debt exposure variable for each of the four

quarters.

An F—test of the stability of

this coefficient is rejected at the 5% level. An F—test of the equality of
the coefficients for exposure to individual countries could not reject the

hypothesis that the

coefficients for exposure to each country were equal.

As discussed above, several additional capital adequacy variables were

Fl/BY and the same vector of additional

formulated and tested along with

explanatory

ratio

variables. As shown. in Table 5, only KADQ2, a

very aggregated

consisting of total assets divided by total equity capital, is signifi-

cant. It is interesting to note that the aggregate capital adequacy is significant only in 83:1 while the coefficient for Fl/BY increases both in magni-

tude and significance over the four quarters. The size of the coefficient and
its trend over time are comparable to the results obtained above where the

aggregate asset/capital ratio was omitted. The trends in the coefficients
over the four quarters suggest that while overall capital adequacy concerns

may

have been important in

on the

late 1982, investor perceptions became more focused

overseas portions of bank portfolios in 1983.

The estimated coefficient for the exposure variable, Fl/BY,

ular

is

of partic-

interest and its interpretation merits some additional discussion. In

general, we would like to infer the market discount on LDC debt fran the size

of this coefficient. A rigorous derivation of this value requires an asset
pricing model with a more precisely defined theoretical basis than that

presented here. Nevertheless, the regression results presented allow us to
make inferences which
shed some light on our

question.

ized in the marketplace to an extent related to their decisions to participate
in developing country debt demonstrates that there is a built—in disincentive

to pursuing such lending, even in the absence of an explicit default. Admit-

tedly, this effect was either not operative in previous years or proved an
insufficient check on asset expansion overseas, to provide a safeguard frcmi
the current crisis. Nevertheless, evidence that the market does provide
rewards for good performance and disincentives to poor performance may render
redundant some of the recent regulations designed to prevent a recurrence of
these problems.

Further research will focus on two areas. First, an event study of the
effect of the Mexican announcement of August 1982 on bank stock prices should
