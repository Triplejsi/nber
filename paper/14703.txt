Disclosure by Politicians

NBER Working Paper No. 14703
February 2009
JEL No. H11,K42,P16
ABSTRACT
We collect data on the rules and practices of financial and conflict disclosure by politicians in 175
countries. Although two thirds of the countries have some disclosure laws, less than a third make
disclosures available to the public. Disclosure is more extensive in richer and more democratic countries.
Disclosure is correlated with lower perceived corruption when it is public, when it identifies sources
of income and conflicts of interest, and when a country is a democracy.

I. Introduction.
Successful political systems hold politicians accountable for corrupt behavior.
The principal mechanisms of such accountability include checks and balances among
branches of government, law enforcement, and voting in elections. Political theorists
going back to Locke, Montesquieu, and Madison emphasize the centrality of
accountability for good government. More recently, the various mechanisms have been
investigated by Barro 1973, Ferejohn 1986, Przeworski et al. 2000, Schedler et al. 1999,
Persson and Tabellini 2003, Besley and Prat 2006, among others. A number of empirical
studies show the benefits of accountability for the quality of government (e.g., Besley and
Case 1995, La Porta et al. 1999, Adsera et al. 2003, Eijffinger and Geraats 2005, Olken
2007, Dyck et al. 2008, Ferraz and Finan 2008, Bjorkman and Svensson 2009).
Accountability of government officials for corruption relies on availability of
information about their activities. Recent analyses focus on the role of the media as the
source of discovery and dissemination of such information to both voters and law
enforcement agencies (e.g., Brunetti and Weder 2003, Djankov et al. 2003, Besley and
Prat 2006, Reinikka and Svensson 2004). Media surely matter, but there is another,
relatively neglected, source of information that facilitates discovery of corruption, namely
disclosure by politicians of their finances and business activities. By exposing
inconsistencies between the politician’s actual conduct and his reports about it, disclosure
can influence both reporting in the media (and thus voting) and law enforcement.
There are complex theoretical issues concerning what should be disclosed and
how publicly. Disclosure conflicts with privacy, for example, which many regard as a
value in itself. Privacy also protects politicians, particularly the well-off ones, from

2

populist media coverage or even from robbery or kidnapping. Such protection might, in
turn, bring more qualified people into politics. But if the political market is like other
markets, then better information about the goods being transacted, such as politicians,
improves market performance (see Hirshleifer 1980, Stigler 1980, Posner 1981).
Even if some disclosure is warranted to improve the performance of the political
market, the community needs to decide what should be disclosed and to whom. The law
can emphasize the disclosure of sources of income and business connections, presumably
to deter politicians from supporting legislation from which they benefit personally.
Alternatively, the law can emphasize the disclosure of levels of income, consumption,
and wealth, presumably to make it easier to identify consumption unaffordable from
official resources. Or the politicians may have to disclose both.

We do not know

empirically whether actual disclosures focus on asset and income levels or on sources,
and whether either of these types of disclosure matters for accountability.
Another key question is whether disclosure should be made public. Those
concerned with privacy can argue that politicians should disclose to some official office
that keeps the information secret unless questions are raised about the politician’s
conduct that require an investigation. On the other hand, political mechanisms such as
media coverage, voting, and investigation are most effective when disclosure is public.
Again, it is an empirical question whether confidential or public disclosure works better.
In this paper, we analyze the rules and the practices of disclosure by members of
the lower house of parliament or congress (henceforth MPs) in 175 countries. The
analysis is based on the laws governing financial and business disclosure of MPs, and on
their implementation in practice. We pay attention to 1) the existence of disclosure

3

mandates, 2) public availability of disclosures in practice, and 3) the extent of
information being disclosed. We collect new data to construct several disclosure indices
for all countries and to assess their determinants and their effects on perceived corruption.
We find that, although 109 of 175 countries in our sample have disclosure laws,
more than half of them do not make disclosures available to the public in practice. Even
in cases of public disclosure, what is available to the public is often limited. Using a new
methodology that compares the potential and the actual disclosure, we find that, for the
average country with required disclosures, less than 15 percent of potential information
about the MPs is actually available to the public. Yet we also find that it is public rather
than confidential disclosure that is associated with lower perceived corruption. With
respect to the content of disclosure, our evidence shows that identifying the assets,
liabilities, income sources, and conflicts is associated with lower perceived corruption.
In contrast, we find no significant evidence of benefits from the disclosure of values of
income, consumption, and wealth.
We construct indices of disclosure by politicians for 175 countries and assess their
relationship to corruption. But why would one think, a priori, that such disclosure
matters? We have found recent newspaper accounts of failures to disclose accurately
leading to criticism and disciplinary action against MPs in over 20 countries. Some
examples illustrate how this works. A Puerto Rican legislator, Nicolas Nogueras, was
forced to resign as vice president of the senate because “financial statements he filed in
recent years do not explain where he came with the money to make a $50,000 down
payment for a $350,000 second home.” The Argentine Economy Minister, Felisa Miceli,
resigned after an envelope containing US$80,000 in cash was found in the private

4

bathroom of her office, and she failed to explain where the money came from in light of
the asset declaration she had submitted. In South Africa, several prominent politicians,
including Winnie Mandela, were caught with assets far in excess of their declarations,
and eventually left their parliamentary positions, some landing in jail. In the U.K., two
Labour MPs, Mo Mowlam and Bob Wareing, failed to declare outside interests and gave
wrong information when challenged. The former was mildly censured, the latter
suspended from the Commons. Finally, in 2008 the U.S. saw two major investigations
(and in the second case, a criminal conviction) related to a failure to disclose:
Democratic Representative Charlie Rangel and Republican Senator Ted Stevens.
In all these examples, financial and conflict of interest disclosure is part of a
broader system of accountability that includes media reporting, law enforcement, party
discipline, and voting itself. In general, MPs are vulnerable to at least two major sources
of undue influence.

First, they are sometimes paid directly by heads of government

needing their votes with bribes (or perhaps more benignly through appropriations for
their constituents).

Such direct payments have been alleged in Brazil, Russia, and

Argentina, and have been extensively documented in Peru under Fujimori (McMillan and
Zoido 2004). Second, MPs may support bills that either benefit themselves or their
families directly, or alternatively benefit selected constituents who pay for the bills
through bribes or favors (Faccio 2006, Gehlbach et al. 2007). Both kinds of corruption
are more easily detected when MPs must disclose their assets because their observed
consumption exceeds the declared resources (Di Tella 2007). Voting for bills benefiting
the MP or specific constituents can also be more easily detected when business dealings
or income sources are disclosed. Once excessive consumption or conflicted voting is

5

detected, they can be addressed by law enforcement agencies or exposed in the
newspapers, which may sway voters. Disclosure thus sheds light on misconduct by MPs
by pointing to discrepancies or outright conflicts.
There is a natural parallel between financial and business disclosure by politicians
and that by corporations issuing securities (Grossman and Hart 1980, La Porta et al 2006)
or by corporate executives involved in self-dealing transactions (Djankov et al. 2008). In
all these instances, disclosure brings the potentially conflicted conduct into light, so that
the ultimate decision makers, be they law enforcement officials, shareholders, or voters,
can exercise their rights in disciplining misconduct.
We examine the relationship between perceived corruption2 and the various
channels of accountability, including disclosure, media, and democratic institutions. We
face the challenge that disclosure rules are recent.

Although some countries had

disclosure earlier, modern disclosure practices begin in the 1980s, and the international
push toward disclosure by politicians occurs in the last 20 years, as part of a broader
wave of democratization. Close to half of the countries in our sample passed disclosure
laws in the 1990s. If the effects of disclosure materialize slowly, we might not be able to
observe, at the start of the 21st century, their full effect on corruption.3
More generally, we do not have enough information to causally interpret the link
between disclosure and corruption, in part because there are omitted variables, and in part
because corruption itself can shape disclosure legislation. Some obvious instruments
such as culture or legal traditions are likely to predict corruption directly and not just

2

In addition to the papers already mentioned, empirical studies of determinants of corruption include
Treisman (2000, 2007), Fisman and Gatti (2002), and Svensson (2005).

We have no data on the role of law enforcement in battling corruption. We have made a substantial effort
to explore the effects of the introduction of the laws, but do not have enough data to do this properly.

through disclosure. Nonetheless, our paper provides the first evidence as to which
aspects of disclosure are correlated with perceived corruption, and as such generates
useful hypotheses for future work.
In section II, we describe our data. Section III presents the basic facts about the
determinants of disclosure rules around the world. Section IV shows the effects of
various institutions, including disclosure, on perceived corruption. Section V concludes.

II. Data.
Sample Description
We present a new database on financial and business disclosure of members of
the lower house of parliament (MPs) in 175 countries.4 Upper house members, cabinet
members, and judges are also frequently required to file disclosure forms, but this paper
focuses on MPs in part because other high level officials are often subject to similar
disclosure requirements, and in part because MPs are numerous enough that extreme
political sensitivity in data collection can be avoided. The data have been assembled by
the co-authors and several collaborators over three years.
As a first step, we used the internet as well as contacts with country government
agencies, World Bank country offices, UN missions, and local Non-Governmental
Organizations and academics to assemble the database of laws governing disclosure by
MPs as of June 2008. There is no standard “law” that addresses disclosure, so in the end
we assembled (and translated) over 1000 laws and regulations, including constitutions,

4

The distribution of countries in the sample is: 45 from Sub-Saharan Africa; 19 from Middle East and
North Africa; 7 from South Asia; 28 from East/Central Europe and Central Asia; 23 from East Asia and
Pacific; 30 from Latin America and Caribbean; and 23 from OECD.

7

parliament standing orders, and anti-corruption and conflict of interest laws. Whenever
possible, we contacted multiple sources to verify the accuracy of information.
The analysis of the laws revealed that some kind of disclosure is required of MPs
in 109 of our 175 countries, and no disclosure is legally required in the remaining 66
countries (see Table 1). The list of countries with no legally required disclosure is
dominated by 27 countries from Sub-Saharan Africa, but also includes 12 from the
Middle East and North Africa, and another 11 from East Asia Pacific. In addition to the
109 countries with disclosure requirements, 5 countries have no legal requirement but use
voluntary disclosure mechanisms established either by parliamentary rules (Denmark,
Finland, and Norway),5 internal party regulations (Singapore), or imitation of disclosure
by cabinet members (Zambia).
An examination of the laws yielded a crucial observation that became central to
our analysis. Specifically, there are large differences among countries in the ability of
citizens to access the MPs’ disclosure forms. In 46 of the 109 countries mandating
disclosure by law, disclosure is made solely to specific government agencies, such as the
Speaker of Parliament or an internal Comptroller, but is inaccessible to the public. Most
of these countries without public disclosure are from low and middle income groups.
Among OECD countries, only France has disclosure without public availability by law.
The other 63 countries make some kind of disclosure available to the public by law. In 3
of these countries, disclosure must be made public after application by members of the
press.

Another 9 countries only make disclosure publicly available under certain

conditions, such as the authorization of the Speaker, the Comptroller, or the MP. Finally,
6 countries have different public availability standards for different kinds of disclosure,
5

Until 2007, Sweden, like other Scandinavian countries, did not require disclosures by law.

8

keeping some disclosures from public access.6 Of the 175 sample countries, only 46
mandate that MPs make all required disclosures publicly available without conditions!
This is a rather low number if this information is relevant to voting decisions.
As it turns out, even mandating public disclosure by law is no guarantee that the
public can obtain this information. To take this into account, we tried to collect the filled
out disclosure forms in countries with public disclosure, using the assistance of the World
Bank researchers and students in the relevant countries. We tried to obtain the filled out
forms of the first four MPs in alphabetical order and of the speaker of the lower house.
We made sure that no inappropriate methods were used to obtain the forms. We were
able to obtain the actual filled-out disclosure forms in 55 countries. In 50 of these cases
disclosures are publicly available by law, in one case (Bahrain) we obtained the forms
even though public disclosure is not mandatory, and in another 4 cases there is a
voluntary system of disclosure in place without legal mandates. We obtained the filledout forms either through the internet, or through one or multiple appearances at the
relevant government office.7 We failed to obtain the filled-out forms in 13 countries.
These include countries where forms must be publicly available by law (Algeria, Angola,
Namibia, Peru, Sri Lanka, and Uganda), with specific conditions (Bahamas, Belize, Cape
Verde, Kazakhstan, Mexico and Nicaragua), or via the press (Russia). The central
distinction we measure is that between any legal disclosure requirement and disclosures
actually available to the public. We have also constructed measures of public disclosure
according to the law, as opposed to in practice, but as we show they are not what matters.

6

South Korea is included in this group because the law does not specify the public availability of conflicts
of interest’s disclosures. In practice, we were able to access all disclosures for South Korean MPs.
7
In 4 countries (Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, and Spain), we could not photocopy the forms but could copy
information by hand.

9

As a second aspect of measuring disclosure, we consider its content and
comprehensiveness. Even among the countries that mandate public disclosure, the actual
disclosure available to the public is often far less complete than that available to
government agencies. To get at the content, we sought to obtain the blank forms that
MPs are asked to fill out from all countries with legally required disclosures or with
voluntary disclosure systems. We obtained such blank forms from 106 countries,
including 101 with legally required disclosures and another 5 with voluntary disclosure
systems in place. We failed to obtain blank forms in eight countries.8 For the countries
where public disclosure is more limited than that to congress, we collected both types of
forms. We then used the blank and filled-out disclosure forms to construct indices of
completeness of disclosure relative to the benchmark of a “universal” disclosure form
that contains all the disclosures used in any of sample countries.

We thus have

information not only about the broad mandates required by the law, but also about the
extent of actual disclosure when the MPs fill out the forms.

Disclosure Variables
Based on the information-gathering strategies described above, we construct eight
disclosure variables. These and other variables used in the analysis are defined in Table
2. Summary statistics are presented in Table 3.
The first group includes two indicators that do not rely on the content of
disclosures. The first records whether any disclosure is required from MPs. As Table 3
shows, 62 percent of countries in our sample require some kind of disclosure from MPs
8

In Angola and Togo there is a “free form” system in place, in Morocco and Swaziland the form does not
exist, in Papua New Guinea we were told the form is confidential, and we have not been able to confirm if
the form exists in Comoros, Sao Tome and Principe, and the Solomon Islands.

10

and these disclosures are always available to congress or another specified body. Highand upper-middle income countries are more likely to require disclosures, while only 35
percent of low income nations have MP disclosure requirements. The second variable in
Table 3 records whether disclosure is actually available to the public, i.e., citizens have
access to the completed forms in practice. In our sample, disclosure is publicly available
by law or under certain conditions in 63 countries but publicly available in practice in 55
countries, including the four countries with voluntary disclosures mentioned above (see
Table 1). Less than a third of the total sample has genuine public disclosure.
The second group of variables deals with the content of disclosure. Roughly
speaking, we ask what share of “conceivable” disclosures are actually made by MPs. For
these content variables, we construct a measure of what is available to congress9 (based
on the blank forms) and a measure of what is actually available to the public (based on
the filled out forms we obtained).10 We assume that MPs disclose what they are asked to
disclose on the blank form, but not more. We use the blank disclosure forms collected
from 106 countries to construct an artificial universal disclosure form that incorporates all
information that any country requires its MPs to disclose. For each country, we keep
track of which of these “universal form” items are disclosed to congress or to the public.
When there is an ambiguity as to what a particular disclosure request calls for (i.e., Does
a request to disclose share ownership cover mutual funds?), we assume that the form
intends broader disclosure (i.e., yes, it does), thus raising national content scores.

9

Throughout the paper, we refer to “disclosures to congress,” as a shortcut for disclosures available either
congress or any other entity that serves as the registry for the disclosures of MPs, even if this entity
independent from congress.
10
In many countries, MPs need to fill in more than one form either at the beginning of their job, during
their work and at the end of their terms (e.g., financial interests, conflicts of interest, gifts, and travel
forms). All of these forms were considered as part of their disclosures.

11

The “universal form” covers items in the following seven areas: (1) assets (e.g.
real estate, vehicles, bank accounts, stocks, and business ownership); (2) liabilities (e.g.,
mortgages, loans); (3) expenditures (e.g., home expenses, education, health, taxes); (4)
income (e.g., from public and private employers, independent activities, businesses,
financial gains, other sources such as gambling); (5) potential conflicts of interest (e.g.,
unpaid advisory work or board memberships, participation in associations and nonprofits, post-tenure agreements); (6) gifts; and (7) travel.
Some countries restrict business activities of the MPs, their ability to receive gifts,
or to own assets. Such restrictions can substitute for disclosure. The universal form
allows us to account for such restrictions. Whenever there is a restriction that is binding
in a given item, we code the restriction as the highest disclosure standard.
MPs may need to make two types of disclosure of items in these seven areas: (1)
the values of their assets, liabilities, expenses, income, gifts, and travel, and (2)
information needed to identify assets, liabilities, the sources of income, gifts and travel,
and parties with whom they have relationships or associations. We refer to these two
types of disclosure as values and sources, recognizing that “sources” is a somewhat loose
reference encompassing all matters of identification of assets or activities. In our coding,
for each of the areas, the index of values equals 0 if no disclosure is required, 0.5 if only
aggregate values need to be disclosed (e.g., total wages, total real estate), and 1 if
itemized values need to be disclosed. Similarly, for each of the areas, the index of
sources equals 1 if items need to be identified precisely and 0 otherwise.11 We measure
the indices of values and sources separately for what is available to congress and to the
public. These data are shown in the four columns under “form content” in Table 3.
11

“Conflicts of interest” have no values. Likewise, “expenditures” only have values, not sources.

12

Measures based on the universal form can take into account the extent of
disclosure not only by the MP, but also by family members. We do not present results
with family members, although our findings are robust to their inclusion.12
In sum, we have four disclosure content variables, based on what goes to congress
and to the public, and dividing disclosures into values and sources. The Canadian blank
form illustrates the components of the “universal form.” Canada has different disclosure
standards for congress and the public. We start by describing the blank form available to
congress. As explained above, there are seven areas of disclosures required from MPs.
The first area is assets. In Canada, MPs must fill out all the details (i.e., address,
estimated value, description, purpose, co-owners) about their personal residence and
other real property (i.e., buildings, farms, land, and property investments). The blank
form also asks about the details and the values of business assets, as well as financial
investments and securities (i.e., stocks, bonds, funds, options, insurance policies, savings
plans, retirement accounts).

However, Canada only requires MPs to disclose an

aggregate value for term deposits and other interest-bearing financial instruments, which
would not allow the reader to know their individual values or their location. Moreover,
unlike many countries, Canada does not require the disclosure of movable assets, such as
vehicles, jewelry, or art. Overall, Canada gets a values (sources) disclosure to congress
score of 0.58 (0.67) in the category of assets.
Liabilities are the second category of disclosure. Here the Canadian blank form
requires all the information to identify individual debts or liabilities, mortgages, and
guarantees in amounts over 10,000 Canadian dollars. The form requests the amount of
12

In our data, 73 of the 106 countries with blank form required the disclosure of all or some items for the
family members of the MP. All the analysis and regressions of the paper have also been conducted for
indexes that average the content of both the MP form and the MP’s family form. Results do not change.

13

each obligation and the name of the creditor or lending institution. This information gives
Canada a score of 1.0 for the disclosure of both values and sources of liabilities.
The third area of disclosure is expenditures. In Canada, as in the majority of
countries in our sample, MPs are not required to detail their expenditure patterns, so
Canada gets the minimum score of 0 for values in the expenditure area.13
The fourth area of disclosures is income. In Canada, the blank form asks the MP
to check from a list of possible sources of income and benefits beyond the parliamentary
compensation (i.e., businesses, farms, jobs, partnerships, professions, offices and
directorships, contracts, royalties, interest, dividends, rents, trusts, pensions, annuities,
disability benefits). In each case, the MP needs to identify the exact source and nature as
well as the amount received in the past and the coming year. Canada gets a score of 1.0
for the disclosure of both values and sources of income.
Potential conflicts of interest are also addressed prominently in the Canadian
blank form, as it requests that the MP identify his activities and involvements in paid and
unpaid contractual or employment relationships, professions, businesses, directorships
and management positions in corporations, associations, trade unions and non-profit
organizations. The name of the organization and the MP’s position must be provided in
each case. He must also report his positions and incomes for the following 12 months.
Canada has a score of 1.0 in the sources of conflicts of interest reported to congress.
The last two areas covered by the universal form are travel and gifts. Canadian
MPs must file a form for each sponsored trip they undertake. In this form, they provide

13

Only 13 countries with available disclosure forms actually require expenditure disclosure. Only El
Salvador, Georgia, Honduras, Indonesia, Italy, and Ukraine have disclosure levels that give them a score
above 0.20 in this area.

14

the destination, dates, purpose, sponsors, accompanying passengers, and the description
and value of gifts received, with supporting documents. Canada gets a score of 1.0 in the
areas of values and sources of travel.

Finally, Canadian MPs also have to file an

additional form for each individual gift or benefit received, stating the nature, the source,
and the circumstances. Although we would know the specific value of gifts obtained
during a trip, there is no general requirement to provide the individual value of each gift,
so Canada scores 0.0 for the disclosure of gift values and 1.0 for gift sources.14
The average of the six indices of the areas of disclosures with values gives
Canada a total score of values to congress of 0.76. A similar calculation for the six
indices of the areas of disclosure with sources gives Canada a score of 0.94. Not all
countries disclose as much as Canada. The mean score over 175 countries for values
available to congress is 0.22. If we only consider the 106 countries with available blank
forms, this mean rises to 0.34.

At the top are Canada, Costa Rica, Jamaica, Georgia,

Israel, Indonesia, Namibia, Puerto Rico, and St. Lu cia, with scores above 0.65.

The

mean score for sources available to congress is 0.29 over all countries and 0.45 over
countries with an available blank form. At the top are Australia, Canada, Israel, Namibia,
Puerto Rico, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United States, with scores above 0.80.
Canada and another 25 countries only make a subset of disclosures available to
the public. The “summary” blank forms and the filled-out disclosure forms allow us to
compute sources and values indices for disclosures available to the public, and not just to
congress. The Canadian values and sources disclosure scores fall to 0.33 and 0.92. The

14

Canadian gift policy is an example of binding restrictions. The disclosure of gifts described above
refers only to gifts which are considered to be an expression of courtesy or protocol. Canadian MPs are
prohibited from any other kind of gifts. Because we code restrictions as the highest disclosure standard,
Canada gets a full score of 1 in both values and sources of gifts.

15

main cause of this reduction is the suppression of the main details of the addresses of
properties, and of the individual values of assets, liabilities and incomes.

Public

disclosure in Canada still contains information that allows identification of accounts,
assets, sources of income, and business connections. The individual forms for gifts and
travel are also publicly available in full. Canada still ranks among the top ten countries in
content of disclosures publicly-available.
Columns 5 and 6 in Table 3 present the indices for values and sources publiclyavailable in practice. These two columns are our most comprehensive summary measures
of the content of MP disclosures, as they consider not only the breadth of the content of
the forms, but also the failure of some countries to comply with their public disclosure
laws and the availability of data in other countries despite the absence of legal mandates.
In the full sample of 175 countries, the mean public disclosure score is 0.09 for values
and 0.15 for sources. If we focus on the countries for which we have a blank form, the
mean public disclosure score is 0.14 for values and 0.24 for sources. Transparency is
quite scarce once we take both the completeness and the actual public availability of
disclosures into account.
The last two variables presented in Table 3 concern enforcement of disclosure.
The first is the index of the strength of the registrar, the body that collects disclosures.
This index reflects three dimensions: whether the registrar is independent from
parliament, whether it publishes compliance data, and whether it can penalize MPs for
failure to disclose. The second enforcement measure is the index of the strength of the
administrative unit which checks the accuracy of disclosure, which might be different
from the registrar. The index again aggregates information on whether this unit is

16

independent from parliament, whether it publishes the results of verification of accuracy
of disclosure, and whether it can penalize MPs for inaccurate disclosure. The strength of
the registrar and the checking units are 0.32 and 0.21 for the full sample. For the group
of countries with available blank forms, the mean scores for the strength of the registrar
and checking units are higher reaching 0.50 and 0.34 respectively.

III. Determinants of Disclosure.
Table 3 also presents average scores of disclosure variables grouped by income.
Across our measures, high and upper middle income countries generally have the highest
disclosure scores and low income countries the lowest. Moreover, although disclosures
of values and sources are positively correlated as illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, high
income countries stress the disclosure of sources over that of values. Public disclosure of
sources is the highest in rich countries (0.32) and declines monotonically with income.
The corresponding values disclosure for high income countries (0.09) identical to the
world mean. Another finding is that enforcement variables are the highest in upper
middle income countries.
Table 4 examines the potential determinants of the six disclosure and two
enforcement measures more systematically. We report OLS regressions but have
confirmed our results using probits. We always include per capita income as an
explanatory variable. One might worry that income is endogenous, so we have also run
all the regressions with latitude, yielding very similar results. We also include the
average democracy score over 1975-2006 from Polity IV, on the theory that disclosure is
more likely in democracies. In Panel A, we include one cultural variable that is often

17

significant in the studies of public institutions, namely the percentage of population that
is protestant (see, e.g., La Porta et al. 1999). In Panel B, we alternatively add another
common predictor of institutional arrangements (including transparency in the corporate
sector), namely the legal origin of the country’s commercial laws (La Porta et al. 2008).
We have also experimented with ethnic fractionalization, which has been shown to
influence the quality of government (see, e.g., Easterly and Levine 1997, Alesina et al.
2003), but it is never significant and so is omitted.
The results in Table 4 confirm that economic development is associated with
greater disclosure. This is especially true for measures of disclosure to the public, as
opposed to merely to congress. A plausible interpretation of this finding is that richer (or
higher human capital) countries demand greater accountability of their politicians, and to
this end impose more stringent disclosure rules to promote such accountability. There is
no evidence that enforcement measures are higher in richer countries.
An even stronger finding in Table 4 is that, for every single measure of disclosure,
including enforcement, democratic countries have higher scores, even holding per capita
income constant.

A plausible interpretation, again, is that disclosure is needed for

political accountability, which works through the democratic process.
The results on cultural and legal variables are mixed.

Percentage protestant is

generally associated with lower disclosure requirements, less disclosure of values and
sources to congress, and fewer enforcement powers, but with more publicly available
disclosure of sources of assets and conflicts.

French civil law countries are similar to

common law countries in their disclosure scores. German and Scandinavian civil law
countries have greater emphasis on public availability of disclosure than do the common

18

law countries, but only German law countries have statistically higher content of values
and sources publicly available than common law ones. Partly as a result of the voluntary
nature of disclosure in most Scandinavian countries, they show statistically lower indices
of the strength of both the registrar and checking units than do common law countries.
The bottom line so far is that per capita income and especially democracy are the
strongest correlates of disclosure.

We can alternatively ask: what determines the

difference between public disclosure and disclosure to congress, which we refer to as “the
wedge”? In Table 5, we use the difference between disclosures to public and to congress
as dependent variables, and restrict attention to the subsample with some required
disclosure.

As in Table 4, we use economic development, democracy, percentage

protestant, and legal origins as explanatory variables. Per capita income is a statistically
significant predictor of the wedge. Democracy enters negatively, but insignificantly, for
public availability, values and sources disclosure. German and Scandinavian law
countries have relatively more public disclosure than others. The next question is which,
if any, of these aspects of disclosure are related to perceived corruption.

IV. Consequences of Disclosure for Perceived Corruption.
To investigate the effect of disclosure on corruption, we focus on the average over
2003-2007 corruption score from the International Country Risk Guide, a standard
measure of perceived corruption with the largest span of country-years. We look at key
disclosure variables, and usually control for the log of income per capita in 2006.15

15

The results do not change if we control for our enforcement measures. The results are also similar if we
use lagged per capita income or latitude. We have also added ethnic fractionalization (Alesina et al 2003)
to the specification, but it is never significant and is not used.

19

Disclosure by politicians is part of a broader framework of accountability, which
also includes the political system, media, and law enforcement. Accordingly, in addition
to considering disclosure by itself as a determinant of corruption, we also examine its
consequences in conjunction with other measures of governance. These fall into three
groups. First, we consider democracy and its types, including (1) average democracy
over 1975-2006, introduced earlier, (2) proportional representation, and (3) partyspecific, as opposed to candidate-specific, voting.

Previous research shows that

democracy and proportional representation are associated with lower corruption (Persson
and Tabellini 2003). Party-specific voting may deter corruption because parties bear the
costs of corruption by their members, and so might discipline them on their own.
Second, in most research in this area, media play a crucial role. We consider
three indicators of potential media effectiveness in deterring corruption. The first two are
government ownership of the press and of television, respectively, both of which may
undermine media’s effectiveness in exposing corruption (Djankov et al. 2003). The third
indicator is the logarithm of daily newspaper circulation per thousand inhabitants, which
in theory should improve media’s effectiveness.
Third, again in most theories, the judiciary plays an important role in promoting
the accountability of politicians. Our measure of the power of the judiciary is judicial
independence from La Porta et al. (2004), which is presumably helpful in making sure
that judges can fight corruption without fear of retribution.
Table 6 presents the results for two indicators of disclosure: to congress and to the
public. Table 7 then shows the results for the content of public disclosure for both values
and for sources. Tables 8 and 9 present some findings separately for democratic and non­

20

democratic countries.

Tables 10 and 11 examine the robustness of the results to

alternative measure of corruption and additional controls.
Before turning to the results on disclosure, Panel A of Table 6 presents the
regressions of corruption on measures of governance other than the disclosure variables,
such as democracy, media, and judicial independence. All these measures of governance
influence corruption.

Countries that are more democratic, have proportional

representation, party-specific voting, low government ownership of the press and
television, and independent judiciaries are all perceived to be less corrupt. These are old
results, and they raise the question of whether disclosure by politicians also matters.
In panel B, we add the disclosure requirement dummy (disclosure to congress) to
the specifications in Panel A. In most of these specifications, the existence of the
disclosure requirement by MPs is associated with higher, not lower, perceived corruption,
although the results are only marginally significant. Only two other governance variables
(democracy and judicial independence) are significant; the most important (and wellknown) influence on perceived corruption is per capita income (Treisman 2007).
The results are radically different for public disclosure, as illustrated in Panel C.
This variable is a statistically significant predictor of lower perceived corruption in every
specification, even holding per capita income constant and controlling for other measures
of governance. Parameter estimates suggest that introducing public disclosure in practice
raises the ICRG corruption score over a third of a standard deviation (which is 1.14).
Only democracy and judicial independence retain statistical significance once public
disclosure is used as an explanatory variable; media variables lose their significance. Per
capita income remains significant in all specifications.

21

Table 7 focuses only on public disclosure, but distinguishes between values and
sources.16

As Panel A shows, public disclosure of values is never statistically

significantly associated with perceived corruption. In contrast, as we see in Panel B,
greater public disclosure of sources by MPs is statistically significantly associated with
lower perceived corruption in every specification. Going from no to complete public
disclosure of sources raises the ICRG score by about a standard deviation.
Tables 8 and 9 consider the public disclosure indicator and public disclosure of
sources, but divide countries into those with above and below mean average democracy
scores.

Both of these public disclosure variables are consistently correlated with

perceived corruption in democratic, but not in the undemocratic countries (Figures 3 and
4).

This evidence is supportive of the idea that transparency matters in so far as it

influences accountability. We have run similar regressions dividing countries into those
above and below the mean income per capita, and found that the benefits of public
disclosure are concentrated in the richer countries.
Table 10 presents the results for alternative measures of corruption using the
public disclosure indicator and public disclosure of sources as alternative independent
variables. Panel A presents the results for the whole sample, Panel B for democracies.
We consider five additional corruption measures: from Kaufmann et al. (2008),
Transparency International, the Heritage Foundation, the Global Competitiveness Report,
and for a few countries the percentage of firms reporting bribes from the World Bank
Enterprise Surveys. These variables are defined in Table 2.

16

Disclosure of either sources or values to congress or to the public by law is uncorrelated with perceived
corruption in similar regressions. The enforcement variables come in significant, but with the “wrong”
sign: greater strength of registrar and checking unit is related to higher perceived corruption.

22

In the full sample, the public disclosure indicator does not predict other measures
of corruption, while the public disclosure of sources predicts Kauffman et al. and
Transparency International measures, but not the others. For the democratic sub-sample,
however, both the public indicator and the public disclosure of sources are statistically
significant for all but the Enterprise Survey measures. Our indicators of disclosure are
significant in seven of the 10 specifications. As in Tables 8 and 9, neither indicator is
significant in the low democracy sub-sample. In Table 11, we consider the robustness of
these findings to the inclusion of percentage protestant, which has been shown in earlier
work to influence corruption (La Porta et al. 1999). Percentage protestant is highly
predictive of lower corruption. The results for the two measures of public disclosure
become weaker, but they remain significant in ten of the twelve specifications for the
democratic sub-sample shown in Panel B.

V. Conclusion.
We present new measures of disclosure by MPs in 175 countries, and examine
their determinants and influences on perceived corruption. The measures distinguish
between public and non-public disclosure and between more and less comprehensive
disclosure. These distinctions motivate the creation of several indices of disclosure.
Several findings emerge. First, there is tremendous variation among countries –
and even among countries with some disclosure mandates – in whether disclosure is
made public and how much is made public. Only a third of the 175 countries allow
public access to disclosure by politicians.

23

Second, perhaps the crucial imperative for political accountability is that
disclosure be made publicly. Many countries keep disclosure by MPs in congress, and
such secret disclosure, even if extensive, is uncorrelated with perceived corruption. In
contrast, public disclosure is associated with lower perceived corruption even controlling
for other measures of governance, such as media freedom and democracy. The privacy
of politicians may have benefits, but those may come at a cost of higher corruption.
Third, with respect to the content of disclosure, what matters most is identification
of sources of an MP’s assets, gifts, and activities, rather than the reporting of values of
assets and income. This result is perhaps unsurprising once we recognize that disclosure
of sources is crucial for detecting conflicts of interest.
Fourth, public disclosure is strongly associated with lower corruption in the
democratic but not the undemocratic countries, which points to complementarity of
transparency and democratic governance.
Our data do not allow for a causal interpretation of this evidence.

Public

disclosure by MPs may reduce corruption, or, alternatively, legislatures in corrupt
countries may successfully protect themselves against disclosure, particularly public
disclosure of conflicts. But this endogeneity concern only reinforces our message as to
what might possibly work in reducing corruption; after all, there is surely a good reason
why MPs wish to keep disclosures private. And the message is this: If a country,
especially a democracy, wishes to pass disclosure laws with the aim of reducing
corruption, the most effective laws are those that make disclosure public, and that focus
on the sources of the MP’s assets and activities, rather than on values. Secret disclosure,
in contrast, does not do much for political accountability.

Table 2
Description of the variables
This table describes the variables collected for the 175 countries in our study. Unless otherwise noted, the sources of the variables are the laws,
regulations and blank disclosure forms for each country.
Variable

Description
1)Disclosure requirements and public availability of disclosures

Disclosure required

This variable takes a value of 1 if the law or regulations of the country require MPs to provide either financial and/or business interests disclosures.
The variable takes a value of zero otherwise.

Publicly available

This variable takes a value of 1 if we got access to the filled-out forms of the MPs’ financial and business interests’ disclosures in the country. The
variable also equals 1 if the country has voluntary disclosures available to the public and we could access the filled-out forms of the MPs. The variable
takes a value of 0.5 if the country has two different standards for public availability of disclosures for the financial and the business interest forms, and
only one of them was available (Belgium, Colombia, Hungary, Italy, and Spain). The variable takes a value of zero if we failed to get access to the
filled-out forms of the MPs or if the country has no public disclosure required from MPs.
2) Measures of disclosure based on blank disclosure forms

Values available to
congress

The index of values available to congress measures the ratio of all value items contained in the country’s blank disclosure form available to congress
over all value items potentially disclosed in the artificial “universal” form. It measures how many “conceivable” disclosures of value items are
required to be disclosed to congress (or to an alternative government agency) by the MP. To construct the measures of the content of disclosures, we
use the blank disclosure forms collected from the 106 countries with available blank forms. We begin by constructing an artificial “universal
disclosure form,” which incorporates all the information that any country requires its MPs to disclose. We then compare each country’s blank
disclosure form to the universal form. For each item, we assign a score of 1 when the item is included in the country’s blank form requesting to
provide disaggregated values (i.e., the value of each property, of each wage, etc…). We assign a score of 0.5 for each item included in the country’s
blank form requesting to provide only an aggregate value (i.e., the total value of all properties owned, total value of wages, etc…). We assign a score
of 0 when the country’s blank form does not include the specific item. When the country imposes a binding restriction (i.e., which cannot be
overturned) on a given item (i.e., the business activities of the MPs, their abilities to receive gifts, or to own stocks) we code the restriction as the
highest possible disclosure standard. The scores of each item of disclosure in a particular area are then averaged to create an equally-weighted score of
values for each area of disclosure. Finally, the overall values score of the blank form is calculated as the equally-weighted average across all six
categories with potential disclosure of value items (i.e., assets, liabilities, income, expenditure, gifts, and travel).

Sources available to
congress

The index of sources available to congress measures the ratio of all source items contained in the country’s blank disclosure form available to congress
over all source items potentially disclosed in the artificial “universal” form (see above). We compare each country’s blank disclosure form to the
universal form. For each item, we assign a score of 1 when the country’s blank form requests the information needed to identify the source (i.e., the
precise location of assets, the identity of creditors, the source of income, gifts and travel, and the identity of parties with whom they work, they have
relationships or associations, or with whom they have entered into post-tenure agreements). We assign a score of 0 when the country’s blank form
does not request the identification of the source of the specific item, or when the information requested is not sufficient to identify the item’s source.
When the country imposes a binding restriction (i.e., which cannot be overturned) on a given item (i.e., the business activities of the MPs, their
abilities to receive gifts, or to own stocks) we code the restriction as the highest possible disclosure standard. The scores of each item of disclosure in
a particular area are then averaged to create an equally-weighted score of sources for each area of disclosure. Finally, the overall sources score of the
blank form is calculated as the equally-weighted average across all six categories with potential disclosure of source items (i.e., assets, liabilities,
income, conflicts of interest, gifts, and travel).

Variable

Description

Values publicly
available

The index of values publicly available measures the ratio of all value items contained in the country’s disclosure form available to the public over all
value items potentially disclosed in the artificial “universal” form. It measures how many “conceivable” disclosures of value items are publicly
available in practice. This index is constructed following the same methodology described above for the score of “values available to congress,” but
only takes into account completed disclosures we were able to obtain.

Sources publicly
available

The index of sources publicly available measures the ratio of all source items contained in the country’s disclosure form available to the public over all
source items potentially disclosed in the artificial “universal” form. It measures how many “conceivable” disclosures of source items are publicly
available in practice. This index is constructed following the same methodology described above for the score of “sources available to congress,” but it
only takes account of completed disclosures we were able to obtain.
3) Enforcement indices

Registrar strength

The index is the weighted average of three separate variables: (1) Registrar unit is independent from parliament. This variable takes a value of 1 if
there is a registrar where the MPs turn in their forms and this unit is independent from parliament, and zero otherwise. (2) Registrar unit publishes
compliance data by law. This variable takes a value of 1 if the law specifically requires that the registrar unit publishes compliance data by MPs, or if
the law provides that disclosures are publicly available, and zero otherwise. (3) Penalties for MPs’ failure to comply. This variable takes a value of 1
if the law establishes penalties for those MPs who do not submit their disclosures, or for any breach of the law that requires submission of the
disclosures, and zero otherwise.

Checking unit
strength

The index is the weighted average of three separate variables: (1) Agency/Body that routinely checks the disclosures is independent from parliament.
This variable takes a value of 1 if there is an agency/body mandated by the law that is in charge of routinely checking the content of the disclosure
forms and if this unit is independent from parliament. The variable takes a value of zero otherwise. (2) Data integrity unit publishes compliance data
by law. This variable takes a value of 1 if the law specifically requires that the data integrity unit publishes the results of checking the content of the
disclosure forms by MPs, and zero otherwise. (3) Penalties for submitting false information. This variable takes a value of 1 if the law specifically
establishes penalties for those MPs who provide false information in the disclosures. The variable takes a value of zero if there are general penalties
for a breach of the law, but not specific penalties for providing false information, or if there are no penalties established at all.
4) Corruption measures

a value of 1 in countries where voters can vote for a party or a candidate, where voters have multiple votes for multiple candidates, or where votes for
a party or candidate are observationally equivalent. Finally, it takes a value of 2 for countries where voters have one vote for an individual candidate.
