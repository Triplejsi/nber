Pay Differences Between
Women's and Men's Jobs:
The Empirical Foundations of
Comparable Worth Legislation
ABSTRACT

Civil rights legislation of the 1960s made it illegal for an employer
to pay men and women on different bases for the same work or to discriminate
against women in hiring, job assignment, or promotion. Two decades later,
however, the ratio of women's to men's earnings has shown little upward
movement. Furthermore, major sex differences in occupational distribution
persist with predominantly female jobs typically paying less than predominantly male jobs. This negative relationship between wage rates and
femaleness of occupatiop has stimulate4 efforts, in both the judicial and
political arenas, to establish "comparable worth" procedures for setting
wage rates.

This paper etimates the relationship between wages and femaleness of
occupation and finds that it is indeed negative even after controlling for
relevant worker and job characteristics. The magnitude of the relationship, however, implies a surprisingly small effect for a comprehensive
comparable worth policy. The estimates indicate that, even if comparable
worth succeeded in eliminating this negative relatipnship, the disparity
between mean male and female wages would be reduced by well under ten
percent of its current magnitude.

be justified by "job evaluation" procedures. Specifically, each

job within an organization would be assigned points in each of several
dimensions (such as skill requirements, responsibility, effort, and
working conditions), and these scores would somehow be aggregated to an

overall index for determining relative compensation levels.' Under the
presumption that WJs are currently undervalued, a legal requirement that
relative wage levels be set in this manner, rather than by the present

cothination of market and institutional forces, would tend to reduce the
disparity in the remuneration of MIs and WJs.

The primary object of this paper is to estimate and analyze the
negative relationship between wage rates and femaleness of an
occupation. This relationship, which is the empirical basis for CW
legislation, is further discussed and couched in a convenient
econometric framework in Section I. Section II presents an empirical

analysis of the relationship, and Section XII explores how the

relationship differs between the public and private sectors. Section IV
sulmnarizes the implications of the results for CW policy.

Although the sources of the functions' negative slopes are not
the main focus of this paper, they warrant some discussion. The two
most prominent explanations for the negative relationship between wages

and femaleness of occupation are sex differences in preferences and

occupational exclusion.' According to the preferences explanation,

distribution of thes, tastes differs between men and women. These

gender differences in job preferences might arise fr socialization
concerning sex roles and "apprOpriate" work (the nurse/doctor syndrome),

differing family responsibilities, or differing expectations regarding
continuous versus intermittent labor market attachment. In any case,
such taste differences would lead to sex differences in occupational

distribution. Furthermore, if the preference distributions were such
that the supply of workers to female—dominated occupations were

especially large relative to the demand, these occupations would pay

relatively low wages. In this analysis, the negative relationship
between wages and feialeness of occupation results from voluntary

choices, and the wage structure cannot be "improved" by legislative
fiat. The relative wage changes mandated by a CW policy would be

undesirable on efficiency grounds and not especially appealing on equity
grounds. 4

might then be advocated on equity grounds as a means of compensating the

latter group.
Whatever the source of the negative relationship between wages
and femaleness of occupation, the remainder of this paper attempts to

quantify that relationship and thereby to ascertain the potential impact
of CW on women's wages relative to men's. We estimate for each sex the
following linearized version of equation (1),

(The reasons why even comprehensive CW legislation is unlikely to reach

this upper bound will be discussed below.) The next section describes

our efforts to estimate the 's and CW's potential impact.

II. irical Analysis
To estimate equation (2), we use May 1978 Current Population
Survey (CPS) data on nonagricultural wage and salary workers, at least

16 years old, who responded to the supplementary questions concerning
their "usual weekly earnings" and "usual weekly hours. - Relative to

other surveys, the CPS has the advantage of detailed occupational

information on a large national sample. Relative to subsequent cs
samples that were asked the supplementary questions, the May 1978 sample
has the advantages of a larger size and a more "normal" unemployment

situation.
The dependent variable in our regression analyses is the natural

logarithm of the ratio of usual weekly earnings to usual weekly hours.
This variable, W, averages 1.757 for the 24,056 men in our Sample and
1.346 for the 19,412 women. This implies that D in equation (3) is
l.757—l.346=.4fl, which means that the (geometric) mean wage for women

is 33.7 percent less than that for men. Our goal is to estimate how
much of this wage difference is attributable to femaleness of occupation
and how much to other factors.

Our femaleness variable, F, is the proportion female in the
individual's three—digit occupation. Whenever possible, these values
were obtained from 1978 CPS data as reported in the January 1979

loyment and Earnings. In occupations for which the CPS cell sizes
were too small to allow publication, we had to extrapolate from 1970

census data. The resulting F variable ranges from less than .01 (for

7

such categories as firefighters, autaDobile mechanics, and plumbers and

pipefitters) to over .99 (secretaries and housekeepers).
The other variables, comprising the Z vector in equation (2).
are: years of school ccwpleted; potential work experience (age minus
years of school minus six) and its square; regional durilDy variables for

Northeast, North Central, and West; three dunies for residence in a
large, medium, or small SMSA; race dwirnies for black or other minority

race; dunes for voluntary and involuntary part-time work; two marital
status duzmiies, one for married and the other for separated, widowed, or

divorced; number of children and a duny for presence of children;
dunes for union membership and, if not a newber, coverage by a union
contract; a government employment dummy; dummies for 20 major industries

(mining, construction, durable goods manufacturing, etc., with private

households as the omitted category); the traction of workers in the
individual's occupation who worked less than 30 hours in the 1970 census

week; and a series of occupational characteristics indices, developed by
the staff of a National Research Council committee,' describing the
"general educational development," "specific vocational preparation,"
strength, physical demands, and undesirable environmental conditions

associated with the occupation. The corfl.ttee itself acknowledged that

these latter variables are arbitrary and of dubious validity; on the
other hand, they are qualitatively similar to the job evaluation scores
that would be applied under a CW policy and therefore ought to be

controlled for in the estimation of the 7'!.
Indeed,

the general question of whether a variable should be

included in the I vector comes down to this issue of whether CW would

8

allow an ip1oyer to base pay on that variable. For example, the
industry duimnies undoubtedly belong in the regressions because CW would

requir. equal pay f or work of comparable worth only within firms. Wage

differences between firms would not be covered, and a fortiori industry
wage differences would be unaffected. On the other hand, whether union
status belongs in Z depends on whether CW would permit an employer to

pay union workers in one occupation on a different basis than nonunion

workers in another occupation. Presumably, variables such as race and

marital status do not belong in the regressions except as proxies for
other characteristics that employers would be allowed to use. Given the
considerable azithiguity in the choice of Z variables, we will make

careful efforts in the analysis below to clarify how different control

variables affect the estimation of the 's.
We begin by estimating, for each sex, simple regressions of W on
F.

The results, which describe the gross relationship between wages and

femaleness of occupation, are reported in columns 2 and 5 of Table 1.

confirm Treiman and

Hartman's (1961) findings from

aggregate data that earnings are negatively related to femaleness of
occupation for both men and women and that the relationship is stronger
among men.

These

estimates, however, take

no account of differences in

characteristics or the characteristics of their jobs. Columns
3 and 6 in Table 1 report the results of estimating multiple regressions
workers'

of W on F controlling for the full Z vector described above. In

9

the estimated coefficients of the control variables are
unrejarkable. It is worth mentioning, though, that th. coefficient
general,

estimates for schooling and experience appear smaller than most in the

earnings function literature simply because the wage effects of
schooling and experience are partly absorbed by the coefficients of the
"general educational developnent" and "specific vocational preparation"

occupational variables.
What is more striking is that the inclusion of the Z variables
reduces the estimated F coefficients by more than half. Pot men,

controlling for Z reduces the estimated coefficient of F from

.343

to 5"—.158; for women, the reduction is from f=.244 to 5=—.O9O. The
new coefficient estimate for men implies a .845 ceteris parthus wage
ratio between virtually all—female and all-wale occupations. The new
coefficient

estimate for women implies a ratio of .914.

Two important questions arise concerning the interpretation of

these coefficient estimates. First, if we take the multiple regression
estimates at face value, what do they imply about the potential impact
of Cw? As discussed above, CW can be viewed as an attempt to set

(1980)).

previously 33.7 percent less for .uen than for men, eliminating aw/aF
would merely change this figure to 31.8 percent.
Of course, all this rests on our multiple regression estimates
and

If instead we used the simple regression estimates

and

we would estimate the second term of D to be .102. Even then, setting
would leave most of D remaining, but the difference from the

multiple regression implications is considerable. This raises the
second question of how the inclusion of various control variables

affects the estimation of the 7's. To clarify the influences of
different variables, we use the fact (demonstrated in the appendix) that
the change from a simple to a multiple regression estimate of can be
expressed as

the parts attributable to each control variable.

striking finding is that, for both men and women, the bulk of the

effect: workers

(especially durables)

relatively well—paid given their other characteristics and are

predominantly male. Once the wage effect of belonging to these

11

industries is separately accounted for, the remaining effect of
femaleness of occupation is considerably reduced.

It is crucial to understand that, even if the relation between
wages and femaleness of industry arises from discriminatory exclusion
practices, CW would not remedy the resulting pay diff stances. As
discussed above, CW would require equal pay for work of comparable value

only within firms. Interindustry wage differences would be unaffected.
Consequently, the smaller estimates from the multiple regression

analyses are clearly better indicators of the potential impact of CW.
Indeed, if anything, they probably exaggerate OP s impact because they

control only for industry effects and not firm effects. Ia ideal data
base that enabled controls for firm effects as well could also take
account of CW's inability to alter pay differences between firms in the
SaDie industry.'

Although of much less importance than the industry variables, the
duzrny variables for union membership and coverage account for about 15

percent of 4.

This

reflect! the facts that there is a large estimated

union/nonunion wage differential for both men and women and that union

organization is much more prevalent in Itis than in WJs. It is also
interesting to note that the portion of the average log wage
differential between men and women that can be attributed to these union

variables

is .30 x .209 + .03 x .113 — .15

x .214 — .04 x

.128 =

'Treiman and Hartmann (1981, pp. 39—40) surrmiarize several
studies findings that, within occupations and industries, women tend to
be concentrated in lower—paying firms. 01 would not address this source

wage differences. Indeed, if CW legislation were enacted, its
inapplicability to interfirm differences might be exploited through
business reorganizations. For example, a firm might "contract out"
female—dominated clerical functions to another firm to preclude pay
comparisons with its other job categories.

nearly the same portion that we estimated as Cli's potential impact. In
other words, a policy that (somehow) eliminated the relative wage impact
of union membership and coverage would have about the same effect on the
female/male wage ratio as would economy—wide Cli legislation.

It could certainly be argued that some of the variables included in
Table l's multiple regressions should in fact be excluded. For example,
a stringent CW law might require firms to pay their nonunionized
employees comparably with their unionized employees. If so, the

unionization variables should be excluded from the regressions.

Similarly, although some variables such as those for marital status may
proxy for legitimate determinants of pay, they may not belong in the
regressions in their own right.
Therefore, to check the robustness of our estimates of aw/aF, we
have also estimated a parsimonious model that controls only for
schooling, experience, region, 5)6k, government employment, industry,

and occupational characteristics other than fraction part—time. The

results are very similar to those in the full model. For men, the
estimated

is —.176 (.015), as compared to —.168 in the full model.

For wnen, the estimated 7 is —.085 (.014), as compared to —.090.
Eliminating these 's through CW would reduce D, the male—female

difference in average log wages, by .085 x .71 —

.176

x .21

.023, even

less than the .029 estimated in the full model.
The most important implication of these results is that, since Cli

would not apply across industries (or, indeed, across firms), it is
unlikely to eliminate a major fraction of the disparity between women's
and men's wages. If the model is estimated without the industry dummy

variables, the estimated 75 are somewhat greater, implying greater

1.3

effects

from QL'• As far as

we know, however, interindustry wage

equalization is beyond the scope of any proposed or imagined CW

legislation.
III. Differences between the Public and Private Sectors

Most of the legislative and judicial activity with respect to ew
has

been in the public sector. Several states and municipal governments
have opted or been forced by the courts to adopt 01 procedures for
determining pay scales across occupations, and a current bill in
Congress calls for the same in the federal civil service. Legislation
applying CW to the entire economy (i.e., with the same coverage as the
Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act) seems at least

several years from enactment. it is, therefore, interesting to see if
the negative ceteris paribus relation between wage rates and femaleness

of jobs is stronger in the public than in the private sector. Is there
an empirical justification for the current concentration of CW activity
in the public sector?
Table 3 reports the estimated 's when the CPS sample is divided
into public and private employees. The simple and multiple regression
results in the first two rows are analogous to the full—sample results
in Table 1.11 For both men and women, the multiple regression estimates

"In fact, the estimates of

in the full model exclusive of

industry dummy variables are —.210 (.015) for men and —.105 (.013) for

women, not drastically larger than those that do account for industry.
It turns out that the occupational characteristics variables are rather
highly correlated with industry and thus account for a large portion of
the reduction in when the industry variables are omitted.
"One

surprising result in

Table 3 is that, for male public

employees, the simple regression estimate of 7 is much smaller in
magnitude than the multiple regression estimate. Equation (4)'s method

would reduce 1), the average male-female log wage

differential, by .042 in the public sector and .037 in the private
sector. Both of these figures are larger than our full—sample estimate

of .029, but they are still small relative to the public sector D of
.293 and the private sector D of .451.

In the previous section, we argued that estimation of 's should

control for industry effects, but this is not entirely clear in the
public sector. A state government, for example, might declare that its
employees would be paid "comparably" across department lines —- in

public administration, hospitals, transportation, education, etc. To
explore this possibility, the third row of Table 3 reports the public

sector 's estimated without controlling for industry. These estimates
are considerably higher than those with industry controls, and they
imply that eliminating aw/a in the public sector would reduce that

sector's D by .064. On the other hand, all our public sector estimates
may exaggerate the impact of 0.1 because they do not control for

governmental unit. Even if a state government, for instance,
implemented CW across department lines, it would not have to pay

comparably to the federal government, municipalities, or other state

governments. Just as the previous section's estimates overlook 0.1's
characteristics indices. In other words, male government employees with
more education and higher—earning occupational characteristics tend to
work in occupations with relatively high fractions of women. Thus,
although the simple relation between W and F is small for this group,
the relation becomes much larger when schooling and occupational

characteristics are controlled for.

15

inability to affect wage differences between firms, this section's
public sector estimates overlook Ct?' s inapplicability to

intergovernmental wage differences.

IV. Conclusions
This study has measured the relationship between wages and

femaleness of occupation. When relevant worker and job characteristics,

including industry effects, are controlled for, a negative relationship
between wages and femaleness of occupation still appears, in accordance

with the concerns of the comparable worth movement. The magnitude of

the relationship, however, implies a surprisingly small effect for a
comprehensive CW policy. Our main estimates indicate that, even if Ct?

succeeded in eliminating this negative relationship, the disparity
between

mean

male and female wages would be reduced by well under ten

percent of its current size, and we believe that, if anything, these
estimates overstate CW's impact. These findings may disappoint Ct?

advocates who expect Ct? to achieve drastic changes in the U.S. relative
wage structure; correspondingly, they may soothe the fears of Cli
opponents who view it as the worst idea since minimum wage legislation.

At various points in the paper, we have presented statistical
calculations of CW's potential impact on the male—female wage

differential. These are useful for assessing CliPs initial effects, but
they should not be taken as predictions of its ultimate impact on the
relative earnings of men and women. The most plausible model of Clii's

long—run effects is one in which only a fraction of WJs are covered by

the law. (At present, CW activities are limited to a portion of the
public sector; even a comprehensive Ct? law would, like existing fair

employment legislation, be effectively confined to the public sector

16

plus large private firms.) As Killingsworth (1984) and Ehrenberg and
Smith (1984) have noted, given downward-sloping demand curves, any

policy that raises the wages of covered WJs relative to M3s and
uncovered w3s will lower employment in the former relative to the

latter. Thus, CW would raise the wages of covered W3s, lower the wages

of uncovered WJs, and increase the fraction of all tlJs in the low—wage

uncovered sector.'2 Whether wlen in the aggregate would gain or lose,,

either in absolute terms or relative to men, depends on the size of the

relevant diand elasticities."
''This result is similar to those concerning the impact of unionism

and minimum wage legislation in 3obnson and Mieszkowski (1970) and Welch
(1914).
"Recent

estimates of multi—factor partial elasticities of

complementarity, as in Grant and Hanermesh (1981), suggest that the
long—run demand elasticities may be rather high, in which case women
would lose froiit CL In addition, unless a comprehensive U'l law

contained strict provisos against "contracting out" (as described in
footnote 9), the reduction in WJs in the covered sector might be very
large indeed.
