Testing Deviations From
Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)

AES TEA CT

The purpose of this paper is to study analytically how the presence of
transportation costs in a model of deviations from PPP affects the testing

procedure of the PPP hypothesis The analysis shows that in the presence of
transportation costs traditional regression analysis will tend to reject the
PPP hypothesis even if goods markets are well arbitraged, because the values
of the regression coefficients are affected systematically by considerations
that are independent of the degree to which markets are arhitraged.

Thus, the

content of the ppp approach cannot be tested satisfactorily without considering
the systematic effects of transportation costs and other costs of goods
arbitrage.

Introduction1

International transmission has been modeled traditionally using two types

of models. One allowed for short-run goods price rigidity and for a flexible
assets market, and focused on issues related to the overshooting hypothesis
(See Dornhusch (1976)), The second considered a sysrnmetric setup, allowing
for flexible goods and assets prices, and focusing on issues related to the

magnification effect (see Frenkel (1976) and Mussa (1976)). The properties of
these •two models have been compared in several recent papers (see Flood (1981)
and Obstfeld and Roqoft (1.984)),

A major difference between the two approaches is in the treatment of

deviations from purchasing power parity (PPP henceforth). The flexible price
model uses a ppp equation to close the model, whereas the rigid price version
generates short-run deviations from Ppp due to the asymmetric behavior of the

assets and goods market. Those two approaches have been integrated into a
unified model that permits the study of the determinations of the extent and
stochastic properties of deviations from pPp (see Aizenman (1984)) .

In

the

earlier paper, the regimes of preet and flexible prices were combined by a
switching rule, recognizing the role of costs of price adjustment and goods

arbitrage, Prices were preset at their expected Ppp level in each period.
Such a rule generates frequent deviations from pPp within the period. Those
deviations were used as a measure of the forces working towards goods

arbitrage. If such forces are strong enough to overcome the transaction costs
related to goods arbitrage, prices will adjust and the result will be a

flexible price regime, in which a modified version of PPP will hold, The
paper con9idered two types of transaction costs related to goods arbitrage——
transportation costs and costs of contemporaneous goods price adjustment.

This switchinq model has been applied recently by DeGrauwe et al. (1984) to
interpret the regression results of a cross-country analysis of real exchange

rate and inflation variability, His empirical results point out the existence
of a nonlinear, positive association of real exchange rate and inflation

variability. These results are consistent with a version of the switching
model in which transportation costs are significant,
The purpose of the current paper is to study analytically how the
presence of transportation costs in a switching model of deviations from ppp

affects the testing procedure of the PPP hypothesis. The analysis shows that
in the presence of transportation costs traditional regression analysis will
tend to reject the PPP hypothesis even if goods markets are well arbitraged.

The results of the paper suggest that the content of the PPP approach cannot
be tested satisfactorily without considering the systematic effects of
transportation costs and other costs of goods arbitrage.
The methodology of the paper is to model an economy in which ,although

goods arbitrage is costly, all markets are well arbitraged, Next, we find for
our economy the predicted values of various regression coefficients that can

be fitted in an attempt to test the PPP hypothesis. We show tht the values
of those coefficients are affected systematically by considerations that are
independent of the degree to which markets are well arbitraged.

Section II introduces the underlying model, Section III derives the
predicted values of three regressions that attempt to test the pPp hypothesis,

and studies their determinants, Section IV summarizes the paper. The
Appendix summarizes the notation,

II.

The Model

Let us proceed by using the simplest model of an open economy, i.e., a
small open economy in a world of one traded good and perfect capital

mobility, The suggested approach, however, can be applied to other, more
complicated models of international transmission. The model used here is a
modified version of Aizenman (1984).

Consider an economy subject to a flexible exchange rate, in which due to
considerations of transaction costs, prices are preset for each period at

their expected PPP leveL

Pt =

(1)

(p + e),

where lowercase letters stand for the logarithm of the uppercase letters, et

is the exchange rate at time t,p* is the price of the traded good in the
foreign country, p the preset price of the traded good at home and Et_i the
conditional expectation operator (based upon the information available at
period t—1).

To close the model, let us specify the money market equilibrium, The
demand for real money balances is given by

where y is the real output, assumed to he exogenously given1,
interest rate, and

is the

c* the semi—elasticity of the demand for money. Assuming

risk neutrality and perfect capital mobility, the interest rate is determined
by the uncovered interest rate parity:

Equations (1) and (4) allow us, by invoking the rational expectation
hypothesis (and assuming no Thubbles") to solve for the reduced-form value of

the exchange rate in a regime of preset prices. In such a regime we find
frequent deviations from ppp2, given by

Assessing the regression results as predicted by our framework would be
useful for the researcher who wished to study our economy by means of

regression analysis or, more specifically, to test the PPP hypothesis • This
assessment is carried out for the case of regressing relative prices on the
exchange

Once again, we observe that even if goods markets are well arhitraged, the
presence of costs of goods arbitrage generates a system in which a standard

relative to transportation costs is significant enough, and will reject it

otherwise, Similar results can be derived for a2,

Summary and Concluding Remarks

The presence of transportation Costs introduces a framework in
which a
standard regression approach will tend to reject the PPp hypothesis even if
goods markets are well arbitraged (in the sense that profits opportunities are

absent). In such a case PPP net of transportation costs

might hold, whereas a

simple version of PPP will be rejected. This paper derives the coefficients
of regression of relative prices on the exchange rate; the exchange rate on
price pressure, and relative prices on the underlying shocks.

transaction costs of goods arbitrage, Unlike the case of no transportation
costs, the elasticity of relative prices with respect to the exchange rate
will depend upon measures of both relative and absolute

volatility. Higher

volatility of the underlying shocks, and lower transportation costs, will
reduce this elasticity, which will approach zero at the limit (i.e., no
transaction costs of goods arbitrage or high volatility). This is because
transaction costs of goods arbitrage will introduce a band within which there
is a unitary correlation between the exchange rate and relative prices,
whereas outside this band the correlation is smaller (zero in the case of one

traded good), Aggregate volatility, relative to the size of this band,
dictates the frequency with which we will be outside this band.
For the three cases studied in this paper, we find that at the
limit of zero transportation costs or high volatility, the predictions of the

simple ppp approach hold, Under any other conditions, the simple Ppp
hypothesis is rejected even if goods markets are well arbitraged.
The results of this paper suggest that the content of the PPP approach
cannot be tested satisfactorily without considering the systematic effects of

The

presence of

costs of goods arbitrage suggests two possible lines of empirical research.
First, one might proceed by estimating the maqnitude of the band defined by

the transaction costs, assessing the frequAncy with which this band is

violated . Alternatively, one might. take an indirect approach, using a crosscountry study to analyse the dependence of various regression coefficients on

aggregate volatility and on transportation costs.

In the present paper there is only one good, thus PPP and the law of

one price are identical, The one—good assumption simplifies
exposition, This approach can be extended to the case of non perfect
substitutability between domestic and foreign goods.

This symmetry is reflected in the assumption that transportation

costs for export equal those for imports. It can be shown that a
symmetric switching rule, of the type summarized by equation (lc),
implies that expectations about the future exchange rate in the

combined regime are equal to expectations in a "pure regime (either
a preset or a flexible price regime).
