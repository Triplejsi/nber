Brothers and Sisters in the
Family and the Labor Market
ABSTRACT

This paper investigates the relationship between earnings, schooling, and
ability for young men and women who entered the labor force during the late 60s
and lOs. The emphasis is on controlling for both observed and unobserved family

characteristics, extending a framework developed earlier by Chamberlain and
Griliches (1975) to the analysis of mixed—sex pairs of siblings.
Using the
National Longitudinal surveys of Young Men and Young Women, which drew much of

the sample from the same households, we were able to construct a sample
containing roughly 1500 sibling pairs.
For several reasons, particularly the
need to have data on two siblings from the same family, only one third of these
pairs had complete data; this fact led us to develop new methods of estimating

factor models, which combines the data for several 'unbalanced' covariance
matrices.
We use the data on different kinds of sibling pairs (male—male.
female—female, and male—female) together with these new methods to investigate
the question of whether family background, ability, or 'IQ" are the same thing
for males and females, in the sense that they lead to similar consequences for
success in schooling and in the market place. With a simple two factor model to

explain wages, schooling and IQ scores, we are able to test whether these
factors are the same across siblings of different sexes and whether the loadings
on the two factors are similar. The conclusion is that the unobservable factors
appear to be the same and play the same role in explaining the IQ and schooling
of these siblings, while there remains evidence of differences once they enter
the labor market.

analysis

Much of the more recent work on the

of male—female wage differentials haa focused

on

labor—force

participation questions and the correct measurement of work experience and has
bypassed

the family background—ability—sohooling debate which had been

conducted

largely on the basis of data on males. There are a number of stylized facts end

conclusions which have emerged from these literatures:

In the schooling—

ability—family background area the conclusion seemed to be thst, at least as far

as measured IQ and measured family background variables were concerned, their

absence did not bias greatly the estimated schooling coefficients in mile
esrnings functions (see Griliches, 1977, and Hsuser and Daymont. 1977).

The

same conclusion also could be reached as far as unmeasured family background is
concerned, but here the results were much more sensitive to potential errors in

the data which are magnified when within siblings contrasts are used for
estimation (see Behrmsn,

et

*1. 1980; Griliches, 1979). As far as male—female

compairsons were concerned, the estimated schooling coefficients in wage
equations appeared to be somewhat higher for females than for miles while the
estimated age coefficients were lower for women than for men. These differences

were greatly reduced but not entirely eliminated when work experience was

allowed for,

More attention to the quality of the

work experience and

expectations about labor force attachment reduced tbe estimated average male
female differentials somewhat further,

without eliminating most of the original

differential (see Becker. 1983; Mincer and ?olachek, 1974; Sandeil and

1976; and Shackett, 1981),

To the extent that the question of

Schapiro,

ability hias'

was investigated using female data, the conclusions did not differ greatly from
those reached using male data,

These debates neither posed clearly nor resolved the question of whether

"family background," "ability," or "10" are the same thing for males and
females, in the sense that they lead to similar consequences for success in
schooling and in the market place.

Some of the observed differences in market

outcomes could arise from a different distribution of abilities across the
sexes, different rewards in the labor market to these abilities,

and different

investment responses by family and individuals.

Ideally we would like to have more detail (a series of

different test scores) and a longer horizon (life cycle data) than is usually
available in the standard economic surveys. Nevertheless, we would like to open

up this question and explore which aspects of it might be answerable with
currently available data,

We were motivated to pursue this topic by the

apparent puzzle thrown up, in passing, in Joyce Shackett's thesis
1981),

(Harvard,

She found that holding schooling and measured IQ constant, there is

still an unaccounted for correlation in wages between brothers and between

To check such conjectures and to interpret them in a broader context, we

have updated Bhackett's data and extended the framework developed earlier by
flamberlain and Oriliches (1975 and 1977) to the analysis of sized—sex pairs.
Our analysis is based on the NLS Young lien and Young Women tapes which contain

information on roughly 1500 sibling paira (male, female, and mixed) over the

1966—1980 period, including IQ test scores for about two thirds of the
individuals. Unfortunately, the data are rarely complete for both members of a

sibling pair.

Only about one third of the pairs (about 150 to 200 pairs each)

have complete data on all the variables of interest.

This has led us to adopt

and develop new methods of estimating such models, combining data from several

unbalanced moment matrices, i.e., matrices with rows and columns missing
(corresponding to the variables for which data are missing in the particular
observational subset).

We cannot really test directly the hypothesis that

abilities" are

distributed differently across msles and females or that they are priced
differently, without having information on a number of different tsst scores for
both men and women.

flat we can do is, first, to check whether the observed

empirical fact persists in a more complete unobserved factors model which allows

both IQ and schooling to be measured with error; second, to investigate whether

this cross—sex difference appears only in wages or can be traced back to the

earlier EQ—schooling relationship; and finally, we can ask whether the data
imply the presence of more than one ability factor in the sense that the male
and female versions of the ability factor are not perfectly correlated.

The basic approach of this paper is to specify a relatively simple model
with two common factors for the observed data (test scores, schooling, and two
wages: early and late), one factor reflecting unobserved "ability and the other

measuring common endowments across siblings which are orthogonal to ability,

3

e.g., wealth.

This model is estimated on data for brother—brother, siiter—

sister, and brother—sister pairs, allowing both the factor loadings and the

factors themselves to differ across the sexes. Using this framework, it is
possible to test whether the factor stttcture is alike for males and females, in
the sense that the estimated factor loadings are similar for the two sexes, and
whether the male and female factors are the same, that is, have a correlation of
unity.

In implementing our model we have chosen to sweep out all of the other

exogenous variables contained in these equations,

both to simplify the

computations and because our samples of men sn lomen have not been drawn in I

This

paper differs from our earlier efforts

(Chamberlain—

Griliches, 1975 and 1977) by including two wage variables in the model,

early and late. We do not focus ,however, on the wage or earnings

growth profiles explicitly (on that, see Chamberlain, 1978, for
example),

Moreover, since we do not include work experience in the

wage equations directly, we do not constrain either the schooling
coefficients or the ability coefficients to be the same in the two wage

equations. Implicitly, this allows for an age—schooling interaction in
the wage equation, which we could not allow for explicitly.

It also differs from some of the other papers in this area by not

including measured family variables such as father's occupation and
mother's education in the equations to be estimated.

Using sibling

data they are subsumed instead in the unobservable family factors f and
W.

One

might be tempted to use them also in a more elaborate MIMIC

type model, but the model to be used by us is already straining our
computational resources and the ability of the data to discrimir.te
between its various slightly different versions.

11

3. Data and Variables

Our data come from the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men (1966—
1980) and Young Women (1968—1980).

(See Center for Human Resource Research.

1979, for a detailed description.) Thesc surveys started with about 5000
respondents each, and were down to about 4000 interviewees each by the end of

the last decade (the attrition is for such reasons as death, inability to
looate, and refusal to answer).

When these surveys were originally designed

(including the Older Men and Mature Women panels), they were chosen in a
stratified ran.dorn fashion from a larger underlying household sampling frame.

This has ted to the presence of a number of same household members within and
across

different panels,

In particular,

it

is possible to

identify

approximately 703 households with at least two brothers, 668 households with at

least two sisters, and 1075 with at least one brother-sister pair, The cohorts
covered were originally 14 to 24 years old in 1966 for males, and 14 to 24 years

old in 1968 for females,

The latest surveys available to us at the time this

analysis was initiated followed them through 1980 with the age of respondents
ranging frem 28 through 38 for males and from 26 through 36 for females,

We have tried to use the data for all the individuals who finished
schooling before or during the survey periods and for whom we could construct
the requisite data.
interview

We use data from three points in these surveys: (1) First

data (196$. fo.r men, 1968 for women) for age, race, and IQ test scores

collected from the respondent' high schools3 (missing for about one—third of
the sample), (2) Schooling level achieved at completion of school (in years)
and wage received on an 'cay job* (after leaving school, not before age 18 and
around age 22 if data are available, later if the school leaving age was higher)

and other assoc iated van ables at that juncture (age, region,
12

city size, and

marital status).

And (3) a flater" wage (around age 28. but at least three

years later tian the early wage) with the same set of associated variables as

of that date.

The rules we followed in selecting our obser'cstions and

constructing our variables are described in greater detail In Appendix S.

Table 1 shows the sample shea which tesulted when we made various cuts on

good data and gives son idea of the relatively small fraction of our
observations which contains data on siblings.

Among the original 10.000 or so

respondents, it was possible to identify about 1600 pairs or roughly 3000+
individuals who had a sibling in one of these surveys.

By the time we ask that

both siblings should have completed school, had observations on both an early
and later wage and data on IQ scores, we are down to less than one third of the
original number: about 520 pairs or 1040 individuals (see the first line of the

bottom panel of Table 1).

The major attrition occurs due to missing IQ scores

and missing late wage (due to attrition from the sample, late school leaving, or
non labor force participation).

Overall attrition is slightly higher for males

than females.

From the point of view of our model, we are missing data for two quite
different reasons:

first, because of the usual problems with sample attrition

and nonresponse, many observations have missing values for one or more
variables. Second, each male or female in the sample may or may not have both a

brother and a sister from which we can obtain a full set of covariances.

It

tuna out that both these problems can be solved in the same fly, enabling us to

use the maximal amount of the available data, rather than restricting the
estimation to the subsample whioh is complete.

Ye describe the methodology for

obtaining such estimates in the next section of the paper, and focus here on
more general data selection problems and sample description.
Table 1 shows that we are relatively short on complete data and on data for

13

sate—sexed pairs. Our data selection strategy was designed around this First.

for families with only one or two individuals in the original sample (most of
our data) the assignment to a particular matrix Us unambiguous.

Foi families

with three or more siblings, however, we were forced to make selections to avoid

using individuals more than once. Ye ordered aibaby data availability and then
: issigned all the complete data pairs we could to the brother—brother and sister—

sister complete data pairs.

The remainder of the complete data pairs •were

assigned to the cross—sex matrix. All the remaining siblings were either
assigned to a pair with some data missing, or if no data remained on their
sibling, they were placed with the residuals and treated as individuals.

The

consequence of this procedure was to lean us with a nearly balanced design in
terms of the number of brother, sister, and brother—sister pairs In the data.
Families are sometimes represented more than tics

but for the vast majority

this means that a non—matched individual rarely has sibs in the sib—pair
matrices.4
This process yielded 24 different momeit matrices with the observationi aid

data patterns given in the bottom panel of Table 1.

Each person from the

original sample who has a good observation on completed schooling has been
placed in one of these matrices.

In sectioI4 we describe bow we combined the

information in these different matrices when .atLmating the model.

surveys overaampled blacks, our sampies hate: a significantly larger non—white

discrepancy from national representativeness.

The table also shows tbat the average age of our respondents is 23 at the

early wage date and 27 at the later one.

This is still quite early in their

labor force careers and just before or approaching Mincer's (1974)
point.

overtaking'

Thus, our results have to be interpreted remembering the relative youth

of these respondents.

In the next section. we describe the method of estimation which we used;
it essentially involves fitting our model to several matrices of variances and

covariasces of the data simultaneously.

Because of this, each additional

variable we include tends to be rather expensive in terms of computational
costs.

This has led us to preprocess the variables of interest by regressing

each of them on a set of exogenous variables and using the residuals from these

regressions to form the covariance matrices from which we estimate the
parameters of interest.

Prom KaCurdy (1981) we know that the estimates of the

parameters of the covariance matrix (including the structural coefficient $)

which are obtained conditional on these regression estimates are consistent and
asymptotically normally distributed with a covariance matrix which does not
depend on the fact that we preprocessed the variables in this fly.

Ye give the

details of these first stage regressions in Appendix B; briefly, the variables

we removed were the appropriately dated race, age, and region of residence
variables (at the initial survey date for schooling and IQ, at the date of the

observation for the wages) and tunics corresponding to the data sample (that

is, the covariance matrix) into which an observation falls.

These dunies

adjust for missing data which may be randomly missing conditional on the
unobservables but still not randomly missing unconditionally.5

In this case, however, the asymptotic

A later version of this

paper will contain estimates of the standard errors which sre robust to
nonnormality of the data.

This is fine for a random sample from the underlying population with all
the variables present.

Hut what is to be done if for one—third of the sample

observed matrix S for one or sore of the relevant sub—samples as missing one (or
more) rows and columns.

There is no conceptual difficulty in generalizing the sample matrix
approach to a multiple sample situation where the resulting O(O) may depend on
somewhat different parameters.

As long as the different matrices can be taken

as arising independently, their respective contributions to the likelihood
function can be added up. and as long as the 0's have parameters in common.

there is a return from estimating them jointly.

This can be done either

utilizing the multiple samples feature of LISV (see Allison, 1981). or by
extending the EIIRNTS program (Hall. 1979) to the connected—multiple matrices
oase.

The estimation procedure combines these different matrices end their

associated pieces of the likelihood function, and then iterates across them
until a maximum is found. A more detailed description of the mechanics of this
approach is given in Appendix C.

The main assumption required for the consistency of this approach in the

context of missing data is our ability to treat the various sub—samples as
independent pieces of the likelihood function.

17

That is. we have to assume no

significant sample selection or self—selection problem, treating our data as if

the missinj pieces are missing at random.

This does not mean that the

expected valu, of missing data is the same in all the matrices, only that (in
the newer terminology of kubin 1976 and Little 1982) the data generation process

is ignorable in the sense that the desired parameters can be estimated
consistently from the complete data subsets and that "hissing data" methods use

the rest of the anilable data only to improve the efficiency of such
estimates.7

To be more precise, the distribution of the missing dats must be.
conditional on the distribution of the anilable data, independent of the fact
that it is missing.

This condition Justifies integrating the full likelihood

over the distribution of the missing data to get a marginal distribution for the
partially observed data.

The marginal 'distribution, sharing parameters of the

original, can add information to our estimates oven then not all would be
identified in the partially observed data alone.

While these conditions are unlikely to bold exactly in practice, we do
expect them •to hold approximately.

The presence or abaence of siblings ía

likely to be random with respect to ihe parameters of interest to us. Attrition
and labor force participation (especially for young women) is likely to be non—

random with respect to the unobserved wage components, but earlier, work on
sample' selectivity bias in both of these areas (Orilichea, Ranaman, Hall, 1978;

Smith, 1980) has not uncovered a consistent and large biasinj effect. While we

do know that IQ is not missing randomly in an overall sense, conditidnally on
our X's and the unobserved factors it too may be: missing at random.

We shall proceed assuming that it is indeed legitimate for us to pool these

various matrices. It would be possible to investigate the issue further, but we

shall not do that here.

Under tho maintained asausption, our parameter

estimates should change little as we include mo're data.

5. Results
Before we proceed to examine the full model results it is useful to look

briefly at simple least squares estimates on these data and to exsmine the

residual correlation matrices for our main variables, by sex and across
siblings, to get an impression of the type of results one may expect to get with
these kinds of data and models.

As mentioned earlier, all of the estimation in

this section has been done with variables from which the mean effects of time,

age, urban and southern residence, race,

sex,. and data presence have been

removed using unconstrathed reduced form regressions.

Table 3 gives the ordinary least

squares and instrumental variable

estimates of a standard earnings equation for• the brothers and sisters
separately.

In order to highlight the differences in our estimates which are

due to the estimation method and those which are due to the use of IV
techniques, we show three different sets of estimates.

are OLS estimates based on all those observations

The first two columns

which had complete data on

schooling, 14, and two wages, The next two columns show 015 estimates obtained

by pooling across several matrices containing.all our dsta, including those
observations which are missing 14 and/or one or more wages. The point estimates

would be predicted by the increase in the number of. observations alone.
last two columns are instrumental variables

The

estimates obtained with the combined

data sample, using the sibling's TO and schooling as instruments, Since most of
our sample do not have siblings, these estimates

are effectively based on a much

smaller number than the number of observations ihôwn in the table.

The OLS estimates of the schooling coefficients are

20

relatively low, but

when they are combined with the age coefficient from the reduced forr
regression, we obtain more conventional estimates, .061 and .059 for males and

0.096 and .069 for females, similar to those already in

Shackett,

the literature (see

1981, and Sandell and Shapiro, 1974, among others), Instrumenting

both schooling and IQ raises the schooling coefficient by as much as four or
five percent in rate of return units but at the price of much larger standard
errors on both coefficients, due both to the reduction in effective sample size
and the usual increase from IV.

Table 4 gives the correlation matrices for our main variables (net of the
previously swept out exogenous variables) for our combined data siblings sample,

showing both the individual correlations and the cross—sib ones. These matrices
are pairwise combinations of the set of 24 matrices for which we obtain maximum

interest, the observed cross—sib wage correlations are quite low:

.11, .34, and

0.07 for brother, sister, and brother—sister pairs, respectively.

While the

general pattern is similar to that observed earlier by Shackett, (.18, .22, and

0.00), we find less of a contrast between same sex and opposite sex cross—sib

correlations. The pattern in the male and female matrices appears to be very
similar,

except

for somewhat higher correlations for the females

correspondingly higher variances for the males.

and

In fact, the covariance

matrices appear more similar than the correlation matrices.

The other

difference which can be seen in this table is a higher ratio of individual to
family variance for the men, a finding which is confirmed by our estimates later

on (compare the diagonals of the two cross—sib matrices).

Table 5 gives the maximum likelihood estimates of our model on all of the
available data for each of the sexes, based on the combination of data from 24
matrices.
"missing":

These matrices were created by considering two dimensions of
missing data and missing siblings.

21

First we have individuals that

have (1) cotplete data on all variables, (2) are sisaing 14 scores, (3) are
missing wages, and (4) are missing both wages and 14 scores.

Second, we have

three types of siblings (male, female, and opposite) with matóhing data missing
patterns and an extra matrix where only. one wage of one sibling is missing. The

intersection of these two dimensions yields nine matrices for each sex and six

for the male-female pairs.

The actual distribution of the dats across these

matrices was given in Table 1.

The final results in Table 5

are bssed on a

combination of information from 579 sibling pairs and 3262
individuals for males and 557

siblings

additional

and .4732 individuals for, females.

The model for which estimates are presented In Table 5

is. the

model given

by equations (2)—(4)and Figure 1, with the addition of a second wage variable.
Since the coefficients on the wage variables are not constrained and there is a
free correlation between wages both within individuals and acroaa siblings, this

additional wage variable imposes no new constraints on the model, but merely

provides another, later indicator of the individuala lifetime income.

In

estimating this model in its moat general form, we allowed both for different
(correlated) female and male factors and for different loadings on these factora

across the sexes.

The estimated correlationa for the two factors

were 0.97

(.07) and 0.90 (.16) for the ability and wealth factors respectively and the
(2) atatiatic for a correlation of unity across male and female factors was

0.8; accordingly, we have constrained the factors but not the factor loadings,
to be tbe same in the results presented.

The eatimatea of the other parameters

are not affected materially by this conatraint.

The first part of the table gives the estimated coifficienta, standard

errors, and reaidual variances while the second part hats the eatimated
covariances across equations and acrosa siblinga The final panel in this table
shows also the estimated wage covariancea for the cross—sib pairs.

22

The method

of estimation was maximum likelihood snd the stsndard errors reported are the
conventional estimates.8

There are a number of remarks about these results:

(1) The estimated

faotor loadings for both unobservable faotors. A and I. are quantitatively and
statistically very similar for males and females (12(5) — 6.6).

The estimated

tans (the ratio of individual to fsmily variance components of the ability
factor) do seem to be different, implying a higher overall contribution of the
ability factor to male success, but also, simultaneously, a relative larger role

of the family component for women in this story.

These differences

however,

are only marginally significant, with an estimated t statistic of 1.5.
(2)

The role of the ability" factor in the wage equation is marginal.

both in the sense that its coefficients are not significantly different from

zero and in the sense that it contributes little to the explanaticn of the
variance of wages. In fact, the model in general adds little (about .01 out of

0.15) to the explanation of the variance of wages once we have swept out the
exogenous variables.
(3)

The schooling coefficients are not estimated very precisely.

If the

relevant age coefficients from Appendix B are added to them, the resulting
estimates are 0.094, 0.063 and 0.122, 0.069 for LIl, LIZ, and males and females
respectively.

In

spite

of the fact that the

contribution of the "ability

factor in the wage equation is not well defined, it appears to be multicollinear with schooling, with the schooling coefficients falling when the
estimated factor coefficients are higher. This basic result Is the same as that
we saw in the OLS—IV contrast in Table 3:

using the sibling's IQ and schooling

as instruments increases the estimated schooling coefficient but also greatly
increases the standard errors on both TO and schooling since the parts of IQ and

schooling which are correlated with the sibling variables are more collinear In
the wage equation.

23

(4)

There is no significant pattern in the residual covariances

reported

in the second part of Table S except for the own serial correlation between
early and late wages, which is estimated at ibout 0.4. Besides this, the only
covariances which appear to be significant are those across the wage residuals

of the as—sex siblings. This is the same effect we noted in the data in Table

4; in these estimates about half of the higher late wage covariance between
sisters is explained by the stronger family component of the ability factor
(both on its own in wages and via schooling) while the remainder appears in the

differing estimates of the residual covsriance (.025 versus .016).

The

difference between the estimated cross—sex. wage covsriance and the same—sex
covarisnces has not been explained by the ability—schooling components of these

variances — the

estimated covarisnces are as far apart as in the original

correlation matrix.

However, a test for the equality of the wage covarisnces

across all the siblings is not rejected due to. their small size and fairly large

standard errors (12(7) a

6.8).

All of the tests based on estimates in Table S depend on the .

schooling, wage correlations (12(6) aO.88 or 2.28 depending on whether we use
early or late wages. Since by allowing free correlation of the wages across the
siblings we have effectively allowed for a third family factor in the estimating

model, the factor snalysis results conf irm our finding that the unobserved
family factors stay be treated as the same across male and female siblings.

Each of these approaches leads us to essentially the same conclusion:

At

least as far as the EQ—schooling nexus is concerned, the unobservables that we
can estimate play similar roles in accounting for the observable data and appear

to be the same constructs for males and females.

Families and schools treat

brothers and sisters symmetrically, as far as we can discsru using the rather
gross measures of IQ scores and years of schooling completed.

The labor market story is somewhat different, however.

Ye know already

that the schooling, age, and race coefficients differ between males and females.

Beyond that it is hard to discern other differences in returns to the
unobservable, non—schooling and IQ related components of human capital.

There

is a alight indication of such differences in the asymmetry of the cross—sex

cross—sib correlations. A sister's EQ and schooling is more helpful in
predicting her brother's wages than vice versa1 implying that those components
of female EQ and schooling which are correlated with their brother's success in
the labor market are less useful in predicting their own success. Nevertheless,

these effects are ssall and not very significant either by statistical or
substantive criteria. A difference of 0.1 in correlation can account for little
of the overall variance in the difference between male and female experiences in
the labor market.

25

6. Conclusion

The main finding of this paper is that the family effects In the TO—
schooling—wage

relationship are essentially sex—blind.

This result

is

psrticulsrily strong for the TO—schooling relationship, where the observed
differences

in the

data can be accounted for by a higher within family variance

among men of the single unobserved ability fgctor. Although we are also able to

accept equality of the unobserved factors when fitting the wage equations,
conclusions

here are much less

robust since moat of the systematic variation in

wages is taken out when exogenous factors sri controlled for and our model is
able to explain very little of the remsining variance.

One of Ihe other

questions this paper was designed to answer was whether we could gain precision

in our estimates of sibling models by using missing data techniques.

In

comparing estimates on the complete dsts (thick are given in Appendix A) to
those based on the combined sample of 24 matrices containing roughly four times
as many observations, we find that the standard erros did go down in many cases

by a factor of two.

However, for some crucial parameters such as the wage

covsrisnces, they did not go down at ill.

ThIs, of course, should not be too

surprising since the wage covariances are free and infdrmstion on other
components of the model should not really help in estimating them.

The lesson

is that the technology helps only when we hav0 ntis data with information on
the parameters of interest.

On the substantive issue that iotivatedthis work, whether ability is
priced differently in the marketplace for men and women, we have been able to
say very little.

There are two sources of the-problem: (1) Wage correlations

across the siblings are very important for. answering this question and we have

relatively few wage pairs in these data.

9'

(2) It is difficult for us to

differentiate between the sexes using test scores, since we have oniy one
indicator of ability, IQ, and in designing that indicator attempts were made to

minimize the appearance of sex differences. An interesting extension of this

work might be to apply this framework to a sample with a variety of test
scores,7 such as the recent rTigl

school and I3eyond surveys (NORC, 1980) although

the within person correlation could be a problem when all tests are of the
academic variety; that is, there may be little additional information in them.

Finally, we remind the reader again that the mean wage for the men aged 27

in this dataset is forty per cent higher than the mean wage for women of the
same age and that this difference is unaccounted for by anything reported in

this paper,

The mean 10 and schooling level for the same men and women are

equal, and our results indicate that they are getting the same returns from
these factors. The cause of the discrepancy must be looked for elsewhere.

5, Necessary conditions are given in MaCurdy 1981. Basically the first and
second partials of the model must be uniformly continuous and possess finite
first and second moments,

6. Data which is not missing randomly may also change the variances and
distributions of the observed data, This can be accomodated in estimation by (1)
allowing the estimated variances of the unobservables to vary with the samples
and (2) by computing robust standard errors for the model, Neither of these have

been done in the current version of the paper but we plan to do so in the
future.

be to compute a correlation matrix based on pairwise complete data and then base

Appendix C

In this appendix we describe in soniewhat more detail the
method we use for pooling our estimates across covariance
matrices which may be missing one or more rows due: to missing
data.

Although

developed independently using a different

computer program, our approach is the same as that of Allison
(1981). His paper describes a method for using LISRELV to obtain

maximum likelihood estimates of linear models when data are
missing randomly, conditional on the obServed dta. We apply the
same technique using the program MOMENTS (8. H. Hall 1979); for
the models we consider, this tunis out to bS somewhAt faster than
using LISREL., although we have used that program to check some of
our results.

Assume that we have T1 obsSrsiMtiôhIona vector of normally
distributed random variables y and T2 observations on a vector
y2. y and y2 are jointly independent across observations.
our case y1 and y may include some of the same variables:

In

for

example, y1 may consist of I, 5, LW1, and LW2 for each of the two

siblings, while y2 may consist of.the same variables, except for

LW2 for one of the siblings.

That is, we have T observations

with complete data, and 12 observations where one of the late
wages is missing.
y2

Our model specifies that y1 " NCO,E1(O)) and

NCO,E2(e)) where E1 is an eight by eight covariance matrix

and E is a seven by seven submatrix of E1..

The parameter vector

0 is in common across the matrices, althbugh sdme elements of it
