Pension Inequality
ABS TRACT

Pensions may contribute to male/female or black/white inequality to the
extent that white males are more likely to receive pensions than are other

groups. Conditional on receiving pensions, the value of pension benefits
varies because white males have the highest level of expected tenure at

retirement. By using a combination of the Current Population Survey and the

l9SOBnker's Trust Corpprate Pension Plan Study, we find that the existence
of pension plans contributes to black/white inequality but leaves male/female

inequality unchanged among whites, Even though females are less likely to
receive pensions than males, those females who do receive pensions enjoy

generous ones, Among blacks, pensions exacerbate sex differences because
black women are only about 75% as likely to receive pensions as black males.

Much attention has been given to earnings inequality in recent years.

Although most agree that the variable of interest is lifetime wealth rather
than current earnings,1 there has been relatively little study of differences
in non-wage and salary components of earnings. Pension inequality is

interesting for a number of reasons: First, pensions are a large fraction of
total. non-wage compensation. Second, there have been recent changes in laws

that regulate sex—based differences in pension benefits. Third, private
pensions have grown in importance over time and may become even more important

in the future.
What follows is an attempt to determine whether pensions exacerbate
compensation inequality across groups•

are two aspects to this issue.
The first is that the probability of receiving a pension may not be random
There

across groups. For example, in Lazeer (1979), Retirement History Survey data
revealed that 49% of the workers in the sample had pension plan coverage, but

blacks were 6.6% less likely to be covered than whites. Similarly, female
coverage was 8.6% less than males. Theee patterns are investigated in more
detail in the CPS data below. The second aspect is how the size of pensions
varies with sex and race of people who are eligible to receive them. This is

more difficult to determine and is the main focus of this study.
There are two empirical tasks before us. The first is to determine the

characteristics of the average retiree in each sex and race group. Especially
important is the average tenure, age, and salary of the typical retiree
because pension amounts in most plans depend on these variables. The second

task is to estimate the pension that each groups typical retiree receives,
This depends on the plan in which he is enrolled so it is necessary to use
some representative sample of plans.

The May 1979 Consumer Population Survey is used for the first task, This

was chosen over the Retirement History Survey because of the emphasis in this

study on male/female and black/white comparisons, The coverage of females in
the Retirement History Survey is non—representative, whereas the CPS has a

better cross—section of the relevant population. For the second task, a data
set that was constructed by Lazear (1983) was used, It is based on the

Bankers Trust

rporate Pension Plan

Study (1980), covering about 200 plans,

Age, Tenure and Salary of the Typical Retiree
The 1979 CPS was used to impute the average age, tenure and salary of the

typical retiree in four race/sex categories, This task was less than
straightforward because the relevant information is not reported in an

appropriate form, Since the CPS is a cross—section, the date of retirement,
and therefore age, tenure, and salary at the date of retirement are not known
f or

the group of individuals who are currently working. For the individuals

who have already retired, neither tenure nor final salary on their career (or

even last) job is reported, Thus, it is necessary to devise a method that
estimates the requisite information from the cross—section,
The

idea is to examine different

cohorts and to infer from the distribu-

tion of individuals across retirement and employment—tenure classes what the

retirement age and tenure must have been, using a variant of synthetic cohort
analysis,

The following example illustrates the basic ideas,

Suppose
for

we are interested in

the average level of tenure at retirement

some group and that only three age groups are relevant: No one retires

before age 55, some retire at ages 55 and 56, and all are retired by age 57.
The

cross—section has workers and

retirees at each ages So let us stratify

sample by age, None age 55 are retired, and their tenure on the current
job is reported. Suppose that half have tenure of 20 years arid half have
the

tenure

of 30 years. Although we cannot observe what happens to these

individuals over the next year, we can examine the individuals who are

currently 56 years old, In a steady state those individuals are identical to
the

current group of 55—year—olds, except that

they are one year

older,

Suppose that half of the 56—year—olds are retired and of those who

continue

to

work, three fourths have tenure of 21 years, whereas only one fourth have
tenure of 31 years.

That implies that three fourths of those who

retired

before age 56 did so with 30 years of tenure and one fourth did so with 20

years of tenure. Thus, (1/2)(3/4)

3/8 of the population retire at age 55

with 30 years of tenure, Similarly, (1/2)(1/4)

1/8 retire at age 55 with 20

years of tenure, Since all workers are retired by 57, it follows that
(1/2)(3/4)

3/8 of the labor force retire at age 56 with 21 years of tenure

and that (1/2)(1/4) = 1/8 of the labor force retire at age 56 with 31 years of

tenure, Given this information it is easy to calculate the expected level of
tenure

at retirement. In this case, it is
(3/8)30 + (1/8)20

The

actual procedure is more complicated because there are many

more age

and tenure categories and because some workers take new jobs and oth'rs die.
But

the basic idea is the same. The procedure is applied to four

groups:

white males, white females, black males, and black females. The subset of the
CPS sample analyzed consists of individual who reported themselves either as
retired, or as currently working with valid information on job tenurt, and who

were from 55 to 76 years old,2 The CPS reports whether individuals who

are

working are enrolled in a pension plan, We restricted the sample to those who
were enrolled because there are large differences in employment status,
tenure, and salary levels by pension enrollment.3

used

Before turning to the estimates, some qualifications are in order.

If ND is biased upward for larger i, then there is a downward
bias in m(i) for large i (and upward bias in m(i) for small i).
Therefore Ei is probably biased down on this account, However, this source
1

of bias is likely to be small,
2. Even though the estimates of N(a, i) are no doubt imprecise, the
usual sampling theory suggests that E(a) and E(i) are better measures than
any of their components, through the law of large numbers, Now if the pension

formulas were .linear in a and i, these means are sufficient statistics for
our problem. However, these schemes are not linear, Therefore in predicting
expected pensions and pension wealth from each plan, It would be preferable to

take weighted averages across (a,i) pairs rather than taking the outcone for
the average persona The preferred alternative is simply not feasible with
these data,

3, The imputation procedure assumes no cohort effects, This is dictated

by a croscsection since it is well known that cohort and age effects cannot
l:o identif ted in a cross secton except through arb trary assumptlons .

The

—10—

formulas above make the strong steady state assumption that for a

a'

people who attain age a' at (a' — a) periods in the future will behave was
if people age a' are behaving today (1979).
We know that the age of retirement has shown a secular decline for males
in the post—World War XX period. Increasing wealth, changes in tax laws and

in the Social Security system as well as changes in family composition and yet

other factors are all contributory causes. If thess trends continue then
E(a) is likely to be smaller in the future than our estimate: The average age
of retirement for older cohorts in our sample was surely larger than our

estimate. al the other hand, those issues are reversed for females, given the
large increase in female labor force participation in recent decades. Since
our estimates for females are conditioned on working, it is probable that

cohort bias of this sort is far less important for women than for men.
The influence of cohort effects on expected tenure is less clear-cut.
There are little data on secular changes in tenure on which to base an a

priori Judgment. If retirement continues to occur at younger ages this is
likely to reduce tenure at retirement as well • However, the relation between
age and tenure is noisy, so though there may be cohort bias in E(i)

qualitatively similar to that of E(a), it is likely to be quantitatively
smaller. thanging labor force behavior of women and conditioning on labor
force participants again makes these considerations less important for women;

if anything, the cohort bias for women tends to go in the opposite direction
than for men.

But in our synthetic panel, N(56) may deviate from N(55) because of real

Expected age of retirement of persons covered by private pensions is
remarkably uniform

across race and

sex groups, Remember that these numbers

are conditioned on labor force participants as well as pension eligibility.
r1iS

explains

the lack of appreciable differences between males and females.

While older females are far less likely to participate in labor market
activity then males, t:hose that do participate show similar average retirement

ages to men, In fact, EaR is slightly larger for women. Since estimated
is close to the early retirement age under Social Security, the somewhat
larger value for women may reflect known smaller coverage and experience under

Social Security than for men. The somewhat larger difference between black
males and females may be due to these same factors, as well as to the fact

that labor force participation of black men has historically exceeded that
of white women. Whatever factors affect these differences in participation
rates apparently also makes black women retire later in life,
The most surprising result in table 1 refers to the sex and race differ-

ences in expected tenure at retirement. For whites

tenure on the job held

we find that expected

at retirement is virtually the same between the sexes

and is a remarkably long 22 years in length. As a check, this estimate is
similar to average tenure levels for those still working in the CPS data,

glance, but is less so when it is

recalled that these calculations refer to

working women at age 55 and oider The estimate

reflects the fact that a

significant number of women are not only permanently attached to the labor

—14—

force but also to their place of work, either through their whole careers or
certainly subsequent to re—entry into the labor market after child—bearing
years.

These similarities between sexes are apparent among blacks as well as
whites in table 1. However, the difference between the races is substantial.
Taken at face value, these differences must reflect much greater job mobility

among older blacks than among older whites, While there is some evidence that
job and labor market instability is larger for blacks than for whites at
younger ages,

are unaware of confirming evidence on these differences

between races among older workers. It should be noted in this connection that
our sample is much smaller for blacks than for whites, and the individual

N(a,i) cells are correspondingly thinner. Hence, the smoothness procedures
used and described above may ultimately account for these differences:
Certainly any confidence interval on these estimates would be much larger for

blacks than for whites, based on sampling variation alone, In fact, the
results for blacks are sensitive to the specification of equation (9), which

causes us concern, This fact must be borne in mind when interpreting the
black/white differences below, Still, there is nothing in the procedure used
that would by itself produce this point estimate and the similarity between
black men and black women is not automatically implied by our method.
The last bit of information necessary to perform the simulations is the
final salary at time of retirement, since many plans are geared to these

figures. The estimate is based on a standard earnings regression for each
race/sex group of the form:

(10)

where the Cs6

Earnings

c0 + c1a + c2a2 +

c3i

+

are regression parameters and u is

c4i2

÷ u

regression errors After

—15—

fitting this equation for each age—sex group, the estimated average salary fr
the average person is estimated by evaluating it at a —
and i — EiR.
The regressions are contained in Appendix A. The earnings estimates are shown

in the third column of table 1, labeled.ES.5

The salary regression does not include the usual elaborate list of
controls such as education, marital stAtus, occupation, and the like because

we are not particularly interested iii this study of the partial effects of
such variables •

Hence

the coefficients on the. age and. tenure variables cap-

ture the effects of variations in these other variAbles that are correlated
with age and tenure. This is conceptually appropriate for our purposes
because
desire an estimate of mean fnal salary for eaSt race—sex gràup

over all education, occupation, industry, p4 marital àtatus classes. A more
elaborate regression would require reweightiag these other effects by relative
sample proportions: The regression above is self—weighting in this reipect and

is sufficient for the problem at head. Also, the regression has been
specified in terms of earnings levels rather thin the usual log of earnings.
A log transform is known to provide a better fit when All age groups are

included in the sample, but there is no compelling reason for using thAt
transform for the older people in our sample tirice it Is well known thAt much

of the curvature in life-cycle earnings patterS odcurs at younger ages.

Furthermore, it is the level and not the log of eatnings that is relevant for
pension determination, so we also avoid the questionable 0u correction for
error variance in transforming the log to the leivel by thu procedure.

5Note that although the earnings regressions are imprecise, the estimates
derived f rem them and used in table 1 are close to the unconditional mean for
each group.

raw difference in earnings between

men and women in the population at large is related in some way to differences

in labor force activity over the life cycle. No doubt many of the women in

our sample re—entered the market after child—bearing. Whatever the case, they
never caught up with the men. This is both surprising and worthy of more
detailed investigation. The same relative pattern is repeated among blacks,
but at a much lower level.

One final qualification is necessary concerning these salary estimates.

The salary observations are censored by the retirement decision itself, Thus
the older individuals in the sample who were working found it in their
interest not to retire because their wage prospects were evidently larger than

their opportunity cost of leisure, People who continue to work are generally
healthier than average and many have superior earnings prospects, so the
observed wages of older—than—average workers in our sample is likely to be
larger than the wage prospects available to workers of these ages who chose
not

to work, Therefore expected salary at age of retirement calculated above

probably

is too large for the average worker.

Pension Values

ical Retirees

Given the information in table 1, the pension of these typical retirees

can be calculated from information on pension benefit formulas. The information used comes from a data set generated by Lazear (1983). A description
follows:

—17—

The data for Lazears analysis were constructed using the Bankers Trust
Corporate Pension Plan Study (1980) The study consists of a detailed verbal
description of the pension plans of over 200 of the nations largest corpora—
tions, The data set applies to approximately 10 million
comprises

workers,

and this

about one—fourth of the entire covered population. The major

empirical task was to convert the verbal descriptions into machine—readable

data, This required Setting up a coding system that was specific enough to

capture all of the essential detail associated with each plan. It was then
necessary to write a program which calculates the present value of pension
benefits at each age of retirement,

Pension benefit formulas are of three different types. The two
common

most

fall under the rubric of defined—benefit plans, which specifies the

pension

flow as a fixed payment determined by

some formula, The patte

awards the recipient a flat dollar amount per year worked prior to retirement,
The conventional plan calculates the pension benefit

flow

from a formula which

depends upon years of service and some average or final salary. In contrast
to

the defined—benefit plans are defined—contribution plans in which the

employer (or employee) contributes a specified amount each year during work

life

to a pension fund, The

flow

of pension benefits that the worker receives

upon retirement is a function of the market value of that fund,
contribution
or

The defined—

plan is much less frequently used than is eithe.r the pattern

conventional plan, Only defined—benefit plans are used here,

Some plans do not permit the individual to receive early retirement
benefits or oniy permit early retirement up to a given number of years before
the normal date, This means that in order to perform the necessary comparisons,

some plans had

Host plans have restrictions on the maximum amount which can be accrued,
and many provide for minimum benefits. Additionally, a number reduce pension
benefits by some fraction of the social security benefits to which some basic

class is entitled, Moreover, a number of plans provide supplements fat
retirement before the social security eligibility age. Sometimes these
supplements relate directly to social security payments; at other times they

depend upon the individual's salary or benefit level. Other restrictions have
to do with vesting requirements, with the maximum age at which the individual
begins employment, and with the minimum number of years served before the

basic accrual or particular supplements are applicable. The accrual rate, or
flat dollar amount per year to which the individual is entitled, is often a
nonlinear function of tenure and salary, and these kinks had to be programmed

Results

There are a number of interesting findings that come from this analysis,
Let us turn first to the question that was posed at the outset, namely, does

pension wealth exacerbate inequality? Recall that there are two aspects to
the question, The first relates to the probability that a worker in a given
demographic category has a pension; the second regards the expected pension
value for pension plan participants. The first was investigated by using the

CPS data to estimate a linear probability model, in table 6 the dependent
variable is a dummy equal to 1 if the

private

individual in question participates in a

pension plan, The sample consists of all working individuals between

55 and 76 years old with tenure reported.

A look at the coefficients in table 6 makes it appear as if blacks and
females do not differ from white males in terms of their probabilities of

participation in a pension plan. (Both coefficients are essentially zero.)
Appearances are decieving because earnings are held constant. Earnings have a
strong positive association

with pensions,

blacks and females have

and since

lower earnings than white males, most of the difference can be accounted for
by differences in earnings. Wh:iie women and blacks who earn the same wages as

white males are likely to

enjoy the same pension participation

status, women

and blacks are unlikely to earn the same amount as white men,
The more important statistic for this analysis is the raw probability of

column reports

the ratio of salary means

from

so the first entry is

11,414/17,970.

First consider black males and white males. The second row of table 5 is

relevant. Note that the ratio of the mean salary at retirement for these
groups is .734 and

that the

ratio of pension benefits is .574. If workers

were distributed randomly across the plans (which they are not), then the
existence of pensions would

tend

to increase black/white male inequality.

This is true for two reasons. First, as reported earlier, blacks are less
likely to have pensions than whites. Second, given that black males do
receive a pension, they

aspects

in

pension

is the ratio of

expected pension, defined as the ratio of the mean pension times the raw

probabilities from table 6. That number is reported in the fourth column as
.518

so pensions appear to exacerbate inequality. (Recall, however, that

results for blacks

are

not astronomical, are

not robust to

specification.) The magnitudes, although

not trivial either. For

white males, the present value

of pension wealth averages somewhat less than two years' income. For black

males, the average value of pension wealth is somewhat less than one year of
income.

Because of the significant salary differences, conventional plans, which
base the pension on final salary, exacerbate the black/white male differences.

Tables 3 and 4 split the sample of plans into pattern and conventional plans.

—23—

The second column of table 5 reports the ratios of means given in table 3 and
the third column reports the ratios of means from table 4,

A comparison of column 3 with column 1 in table 5 reveals that the ratios
in the third column are smaller for all groups that do not include black
females, because salary levels are important for computation of conventional

at

pension plans, Black males who have conventional plans are

even more of a

disadvantage relative to white males in the same plans because their earnings

are lower, Perhaps more important is that blacks and whites are unlikely to

be found in similar proportions in the two plan types, Pattern plans are more
typical for production workers, whereas the conventional plan is the norm for

management and white—collar workers, To the extent that blacks are over—
represented among pattern plans, pension inequality is

The findings for black females and white females are even more striking,

The salary column of table 5 reveals that the

ratio of black to white female

salary is .942, whereas the ratio of pension value is only .679. If all white
females were in conventional plan occupations and all black females were in
pattern plan occupations, the pension inequality would be even

The male/female comparisons are less clear—cut. Effects go in opposite
directions, As reported above, female workers are less likely to be enrolled
in a pension plan than male workers, but if they are enrolled, the white

females do well relative to their male counterparts The first row of table 5
contains the relevant information, The ratio of final salary of white females

to white males is .635 whereas the ratio of pension values is .776, This
implies an equalizing effect of pension benefits, Part of this results from
the fact that defined-benefit plans are not sex-specific, so that women, with
longer life expectancies, do better than men, But this cannot account for the
large difference between .776 and .635w

The reason why women do so well in pension benefits can best be understood by examining the distinction between pattern and conventional plans.
Note that women are almost on par with men in terms of pension benefits

received in pattern plans, This results from one factor: Pattern plans depend
only on years of service and in that respect, the women who are working at age

55 are quite similar to men, This large value of tenure maps into high
pension flows in the pattern plan. (Because of the actuarial unfairness of
the plan, it could actually have gone the other way, Since tenure levels are
close to comparable, the longer life expectancy of females could have made
their pattern plan pensions worth more than those for males.)
The equalizing effect of pensions is offset almost exactly by the fact
that

fewer men are enrolled in pension plans than men. From table 6, white

men had a probability of receiving a pension of .608,

a

whereas white women had

probability of .482, It is useful, therefore, to compare expected pensions.

The ratio of expected pension for white females to white males is .615 from

the last column of table 5, Thus, pensions leave white female/white male
wealth inequality unaltered,

25
The same pattern is displayed for blacks. The black female's final
salary is 81% that of black males in this sample and the mean black female's

pension benefit is 92% of the mean black male's pension. But expected pension
ratios
be

tell the opposite story. Since black females

pension

are much less likely to

recipients, the ratio of expected pension benefits is .687. Thus,

pensions increase male/female inequality substantially among blacks,
This conclusion is strengthened somewhat when it is recalled that these

women are not a random sample of the overall population of women. Since a
larger proportion of women will have dropped out of the labor force before
reaching age 55, and since it is likely that those individuals have very small
pension wealth, the numbers presented in the last paragraph tend to understate
the disequalizing effect of pensions in the overall economy.
Other interesting findings are worthy of discussion, Most obvious

is

that

there is much more variation in the benefits provided by conventional plans

than in those provided by pattern plans. A comparison of tables 3 and 4 is

instructive, For all four groups, the

standard deviation is much larger

for

plans. Similarly, with the exception of white males, medians are

conventional

about the same across plan types, but the maximum and minimum values are much
more extreme in the case of conventional plans.
Variance in pension benefits received in

conventional plans depends on

Before concluding, we should mention that there is another study which
addresses the same questions as we do, but obtains somewhat different results,
McCarthy and Turner (1984) find that blacks actually have higher pensions than
whites do, both in terms of pension flow and pension wealth (see their table

1). They use the Survey of Private Pension Benefit Amounts, a data set that
permits pairing of individuals with the actual pensions they receive, On the
face of it, this data set is superior to those that we have used. But their
findings leave some grounds for doubt on that score. In particular, it is
difficult to believe that blacks have higher pensions than whites because even
in the group of pension plan participants, the average final salary of a black

male is only 63.5% of the white male (see our table 5). Since many pension
plans depend on final salary, even if tenure at retirement did not differ

between groups, the pension flow ratio would mirror the salary ratio, It is
important to reconcile the two sets of results, but McCarthy and Turner are
unable to make their data available to the public, so their results cannot be
replicated.

Conclusion
The existence of pension plans appears to contribute to black/white

inequality, but leaves male/female inequality unchanged among whites, Even
though females are less likely to receive pensions than males, those females

who do receive pensions tend to receive relatively generous ones, Of course,
the average pension that the typical retiring female receives is well below

that received by the typical male retiree, But the difference is not as
pronounced as male/female differences in salary. Among blacks, pensions
exacerbate sex differences, mainly because black women are only about 75% as
likely to receive pensions as black males,
