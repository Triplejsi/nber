Money, Credit and Interest Rates
in the Business Cycle
ABS TRACT

Fluctuations of business activity in the United States clearly

their monetary and financial side, but these aspects of U.S.
economic fluctuations exhibit few quantitative regularities that have
persisted unchanged across spans of tine over which the nation's financial
have

markets

have themselves undergone significant change.

The evidence on monetary and financial aspects of U.S. business
cycles assembled in this paper shows major differences among the pre World
War I, inter—war, and post World War II periods, and between the first and
second halves of the post—war period. Evidence suggesting changes from
one period to another repeatedly emerges, regardless of whether the method
of analysis is simple or sophisticated, regardless of whether the underlying
data are annual or quarterly, and regardless of whether the relationships
under study are bivariate or multivariate. Moreover, the differences
between one period and another are significant not just statistically but
also economically, in the sense of major differences in the magnitude and
timing of cyclical movements.

The paper's main message, therefore, is a warning against accepting

too readily — either as a matter of positive economics or for policy
purposes — the appearance of simple and eternal verities in much of the

existing literature of monetary and financial aspects of business fluctuations.
?bre complicated models involving many variables and/or nonlinear
relationships may have remained stable, but the evidence clearly shows
that simple linear relationships among only a few such variables have not.

MONEY, CREDIT AND INTEREST RATES IN THE BUSINESS CYCLE

Benjamin N. Friedman*

The monetary and financial aspects of fluctuations in economic
activity have attracted the attention of economists and other observers

of the business cycle for a long time. Throughout the nineteenth century
and into the early years of the twentieth, business downturns in the
United States were typically associated in a quite obvious way with
9panics'

or other sharp discontinuities in the financial markets. Such

readily visible events have all but vanished since the establishment of
the Federal Reserve System in 1914 and especially the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation in 1934, but the pace of activity in the financial

has continued to vary closely with that in many of the economy's

markets

nonfinancial markets. Much of this covariation is by now highly familiar,
if not necessarily well understood. The regularities on which macroeconomists
have

focused most intensively in this context are those involving money

(including either high-powered money or deposit money), credit (including

public debt, private debt, or the sum of the two), and interest rates.1
In large part because of the availability of data extending back to the

early

years of this century, and in some cases still earlier, the documentation

of these regularities over fairly long time periods is now broadly familiar.
One factor motivating the long history of interest in this subject
is, of course, simply the desire to understand more fully the underlying

causes and internal dynamics of business fluctuations. Implications for
public policy have also been important in this regard, however. A common
thread running through decades of literature on the monetary and financial
aspects of business cycles has been the actual or potential role of monetary

—2--

policy in affecting either real economic outcomes or price stability,

or both. Indeed, even those strands of literature which have argued vigorously
against the existence of any possibility for monetary policy to improve
real outcomes have heavily emphasized the negative results to follow,

typically via the speed or variability of price inflation, from an ill chosen
(according to that view) policy regime.

The basic theme of this paper, in contrast to much of the extensive

monetary and financial variables to the business cycle exhibit

if any strongly persistent regularities which have remained even

approximately invariant in the context of the widespread and, in some
instances,

dramatic changes undergone by the U.S. financial markets over

familiar time periods both long and short. At a qualitative level, of
course, broadly familiar regularities have characterized many monetary

and financial aspects of U.S. business fluctuations. The procyclical
behavior of money, credit and interest rates is well known, as is the
tendency of money and credit growth to "lead" real economic growth at

major business cycle turning points. Nevertheless, these characteristic
qualitative features of most business fluctuations have not corresponded
to persistent regularities in the quantitative relationships that constitute
the main focus of modern business cycle analysis.

The finding that stable quantitative relationships to monetary
and

financial

variables have been absent from the U.S. business cycle

experience does not mean that monetary and financial phenomena are
unimportant elements of business fluctuations, nor that there is no

consistent

basis for seeking to understand or explain these phenomena.

The basic monetary and financial elements of economic behavior have no

—3—

doubt persisted

in some fundamental sense. The problem is instead that

these basic elements of economic behavior do not correspond straightforwardly
in theory or closely in practice to the specific quantities that economists

can typically measure. In addition, the relevant behavior is probably
far too complex to be readily represented in simple linear relationships
limited to very few variables.

From the perspective of positive economics based on familiar and
available data, therefore, the main message of this paper is that simple
relationships usually taken to be central to monetary and financial aspects

of business cycles have in the past changed often and much. From the
perspective

is

of inferences about monetary policy, the chief implication

a warning against proceeding as if any one, or a few of these simple

relationships will reliably remain immutable.
Changes in

the working of the U.S. financial markets that are

potentially important for monetary and financial aspects of business
fluctuations are not difficult to identify. Within the twentieth century
the entire apparatus and orientation of U.S. monetary policy have undergone

several dramatic shifts. In addition to monetary policy, major changes
in government regulation

and the expansion of government intermediation

have been further potentially important and often shifting influences.

Moreover, the nation's private financial institutions and practices have
also
in

undergone profound and far reaching changes over these years, in part

response to changing patterns of government regulation and monetary

policy but as a result, too, of private institutions' taking advantage of
new developments

elsewhere in the economy.

Jny attempt to see whether the monetary and financial aspects

of

U.S.

economic fiuctuatiors have remained invariant, or nearly so, in

—4--

the

face of these financial market changes must at the

outset

confront the

methodological choice between structural and reduced-form approaches to this

question. A structural framework imposes potentially valuable restrictions

on
the

the way

in which the corresponding empirically estimated model summarizes

quantitative relationships exhibited by the prior experience in question.

Whatever analysis is grounded in a specific structural model is therefore

conditional on those restrictions. Istrictions that are valid reflections
of

actual economic behavior will enable the model to extract the relevant

behavioral relationships more efficiently from the available data, but

or arbitrary restrictions will distort the representation of those
relationships. Either kind of error can introduce the appearance of change
incorrect

where in fact there has been continuity, or of continuity where there has
been change.
The subject of monetary and financial influences on economic

fluctuations is not lacking for suggested structural frameworks. One
long—familiar strand of thinking along these lines, which has emphasized
interest rate, asset price, and credit rationing effects on specific kinds of
spending, is the expanded IS—LM aggregate demand model typical of the

post—Keynesian neoclassical synthesis, perhaps best exemplified empirically

by the MPS model.2 A closely related line of structural analysis, which
has placed more emphasis on portfolio substitutions and asset valuations,
is the disaggregated asset market approach of Tobin (1961, 1969) and

Erunner and Meltzer (1972, l97). A third line of analysis, which in its
structural components is also related to these two, but which has more
narrowly emphasized the role of monetary assets in affecting aggregate

demand, is the monetarist model of Friedman (1956, 1971), as exemplified

empirically by the St. uis model.3 A more different line of structural

—5—

analysis is the rational expectations model of aggregate supply developed

by Lucas (1972, 1973), and exemplified empirically by Sargent (1976). A
still more recent line of analysis has been the explicit banking sector

model of Fama (l980a, 198Gb).4 Moreover, each of these different structural
approaches essentially refers to a closed economy. To the extent that the
U.S. economy's increasing openness may also be important for monetary and

financial aspects of economic fluctuations, the range of choice — and,

consequently, of potential disagreement —

is

only greater.

The approach taken in this paper is to sidestep the choice among,

or synthesis of, these disparate structural models, and to employ instead
only a reduced-form empirical approach that in principal is compatible

with any of them. The basic advantage in this approach is to avoid making
the analysis conditional on explicit structural restrictions that would
attract sharp disagreement from the outset, and that could indeed be

incorrect. The key disadvantages are the loss of efficiency in the extraction
of the relevant quantitative relationships from the data and, correspondingly,
the loss of explicit connection between the estimated relationships and
more specific elements of monetary and financial behavior.
Section

I sets the stage for the empirical analysis by briefly

reviewing the major twentieth century changes in the U.S. financial

markets that would make it surprising if there had been no significant
changes

during

in the monetary and financial aspects of U.S.

this period —

at

economic fluctuations

least under the view that the prevailing institutions,

including government structures as well as private business practices,

importantly affect economic behavior. Section II documents at a
qualitative level the familiar interrelatedness of money, credit, interest
rates and nonfinancial economic activity in a business cycle context, but

—6—

then goes on to point out some changes in these relationships over time

that

are apparent even at a very simple level of analysis. Section III

digresses to consider the relationships connecting money, credit and
their respective "velocities" to the flucutations of both nominal and
real income during the economy's seven and one—half recognized business

cycles since World War II. Section IV applies formal time—series and
frequency-domain
explicitly

methods to examine at a quantitative level,

and in an

dynamic context, the familiar relationships introduced in

Section II. Section V pursues this line of analysis further, to determine
whether differences in these familiar relationships from one time

to

period

another are signficant not just in a statistical sense but economically

as well. Section VI digresses again to consider the post—war evidence on
the economy's "credit cycle." Section VII concludes by summarizing the

principal

eitirical findings presented throughout the paper.

Financial

the U.S. Economy's

i.

Structure

whether or not the monetary and financial aspects of economic
fluctuations in the United States have changed their character over any
specific period of time

within the twentieth century, for example, or

since World War II, or since October 1979 —

is

an empirical issue. Before

examining the evidence on this question, however, it is appropriate to ask
whether during the relevant time

period

there have been changes in the

economy's underlying financial structure that, at least in principle, could
have effected changes in the cyclical relationships between monetary and

financial variables and nonfinancial economy activity. Three broad
categories of changes in the U.S. economy's financial structure stand out
in this regard.

First, within the time period spanned by available data (and studied
in this paper) ,

the

entire apparatus and orientation of U.S. monetary

policy have undergone dramatic shifts. Before 1914 the United States had no
central bank as such, but relied instead on a largely unregulated national

banking system anchored by a gold standard. Prompted by a recurrent series
of financial crises and panics, especially in 1901, 1907 and 1913, Congress

created a new Federal Reserve System charged with the basic task of

preserving stability in the financial markets —more specifically,
instructed "to furnish an elastic currency." The macroeconomic objectives
almost universally associated with monetary policy in the post World War II
era, including especially the objective of price stability, received no
mention in the original Federal Peserve Act.
Between 1914 and World War II, monetary policy evolved in a variety

of ways, as Federal Peserve decision makers gradually came to understand
what effects the System's open market purchases and sales of government

—8—

securities

had

in

the new world of fractional reserve banking directly

based on central bank liabilities. The establishment in 1923 of what
subsequently evolved into today's Federal Open Market Committee led
temporarily to an increasing emphasis on open market operations in

a

monetary

policy context, but in the 1930s the confusions of the depression and the
associated international monetary crisis, including the abandonment of the
gold standard in 1934, arrested the developmont of the monetary policy

mechanism. Then, during World War II and thereafter until 1951, this
evolution effectively ceased as the Federal Reserve assumed an obligation
to support the open market price of the government's outstanding debt (which
was then almost entirely a war loan)
In 1951 the Treasury—Federal Reserve Accord relieved the central

bank of this obligation, and monetary policy assumed the quasi—independent
macroeconomic role it
several

then.

has played

ever since. Even so, there have been

major changes in monetary policy orientation and procedures since

In the early post-Accord years, the Federal Reserve keyed its

operations to the net free reserve position of the commercial banking system.

By the late 1960s, the principal policy focus had changed to setting
interest rates on short—term debt instruments, sometimes Treasury bills
and later on federal funds. From 1970 onward, quantity targets for
the growth of various aggregative measures of money and credit, including
especially the narrowly defined money stock (Ml), played a generally increasing
albeit sporadic role in the formulation and implementation of monetary policy.
In 1979 the Federal Reserve announced a renewed emphasis on these quantity
growth targets and adopted new operating procedures, based on the growth rate

of nonborrowed bank reserves, for achieving them. In 1982 the Ml target was
publicly suspended, however, and the weight placed on even the broader money

and credit targets in 1982 and 1983 was uncertain. As of the time of writing,

the role of quantity growth targets in U.S. monetary policy may be

central, irrelevant or, more likely, somewhere in between.
Second, the often shifting evolution of monetary policy has hardly

been the only way in which actions of the federal government (not to mention
those of state governments) have effected structural changes that may

well have altered, perhaps importantly, how the economy's financial and

nonfinancial markets interact in a business cycle context.6 Government
regulatory actions have also been a potentially important and often

changing influence. The three most dramatic such changes — the insurance
of private bank deposits, the prohibition of interest on demand deposits,

and the separation of the commercial banking and securities industries —

all

took effect in the l930s. Further potentially important changes in

bank regulation and supervision have occurred since then from time to tin,
including most prominently the key legislation governing bank holding
companies in the late 1960s and the deregulation of banks and other

depository institutions in the early 1980s. Moreover, in several further
complete turns of the wheel, the prohibition of interest on demand deposits

become effectively inoperative within the past decade, while long-standing

has

prohibitions on interstate banking and on banking firms engaging in the

securities business (and
most

vice versa) are even now becoming fictional. Perhaps

importantly, in recent years the entire distinction between transactions

balances and savings balances has become blurred to the point of meaninglessness.
changes in government financial regulation have also extended well
beyond

the banking system and other depository institutions. The

securities legislation of the 1L93Os created a whole new separate industry,

and subsequent regulation has continued to affect how it works. Key regulatory
changes effected by the Securities and Exchange Commission have ranged

—10--

from requiring competitive bidding in most public utility company

underwritings
end

beginning in

the 1950s, to allowing the spread of open—

mutual funds beginning in the 1960s, to prohibiting fixed minimum

commissions on stock exchange brokerage beginning in the 1970s, to

permitting shelf" offerings of corporate securities beginning in the
1980s. As a result of these and many other regulatory actions over the
years, the securities markets in the United States function differently
today

than they thu in

earlier times.

The National Banking Act of 1933 introduced deposit interest rate
ceilings, in part. as a response to banks' alleged overly aggressive

bidding for interbank demand deposits during the l920s. The ceilings have
also applied to time and saving deposits, however, and in this context
they have at times had enormous impacts on the workings of the financial

markets and on the financing of economic activity. Specific episodes of
disintermediation during the 1960s and 1970s, due to Regulation Q

ceiling

rates that remained low in comparison to sharply rising market interest
rates, led to the rise of whole new patterns of portfolio behavior and to

periodic depression in the homebuilding industry. The Federal Reserve System
first moved to eliminate these adverse effects in 1970 by suspending the

ceiling on interest paid on most large bank certificates of deposit. As of
the time of writing, these ceilings appear to be on the way out altogether
as a result of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary
Control Act of 1980.

A related development in the government's role in the credit market,

which came about in part in response to the distortions caused by deposit
interest ceilings, has been the great increase in government intermediation.
The Federal Home Loan Bank System and the Federal Intermediate Credit Bank

—11---

began operations before World War II, but the scale of their activity was small

at first and their initial focus was on agricultual credit. The Federal
National Mortgage Association began its lending operations in 1955.

Only in

the 1960s and 1970s, however, as periodic disintermediation became severe,
did the scope and size of government financial intermediation expand

greatly. In recent years, the government sponsored credit agencies have
been joined by pools issuing mortgage—backed securities that are not only

government sponsored but, in some cases, formally guaranteed. As of
the late 1960s, and as recently as 1982, it was not atypical for these
quasi—government institutions to account for half or more of all home

mortgage lending in the United States in high disintermediation years.
Moreover, in recent years the federal government has extended its direct
loan and loan guarantee operations far beyond housing— and agriculture—
related credits, to the benefit of such diverse borrowers as college students,

New York City, and the Lockheed and Qrysler corporations.
Third, the nation!s private financial institutions and practices

have undergone profound and far reaching changes over these years, in part
in response

policy but

to changing patterns of government regulation and monetary

also in large part as a result of private initiatives taking

advantage of new developments elsewhere in the economy, including
especially the rapidly changing technology of communications

processing.

New forms

of

and data

deposits (for example, negotiable time certificates,

Eurodollar credits, and money market deposit accounts) and new securities
(for example, variable—rate mortgages, floating—rate notes, interest rate

futures, and listed stock options) have come, and in some cases gone. So
have new kinds of financial institutions (for example, money market mutual
funds and mortgage pass-through pools).

—12—

Other

forms of

change in private financial practices have been more

gradual, but potentially just as important. The nation's financial
markets have steadily become less segmented, and presumably more efficient

in the classic sense. Diverse regional markets have become more integrated,
though still far from entirely so, and barriers separating different kinds
of borrowers from different kinds of depositors or lenders have steadily

eroded. Meanwhile, some institutions like pension funds

and

credit unions

have grown rapIdly in relative terms, while others like insurance companies

and mutual savings banks have done the opposite. In a further series of
developments of potentially very great importance for the questions at
issue here, the U.S. financial markets as a whole have at times become less

open to foreign participation, and more recently more so, as capital controls
have come and gone, while most (though not all) foreign markets have become

more accessible from here. Indeed, during large parts of the period under
study here, many key foreign currencies simply were not convertible.

Although adequately summarizing the elements of these private
financial market changes that are of greatest potential importance in a
business cycle context is probably impossible, given the space available

here, several basic trends that are relevant in this context stand out. One
is that transactions costs have fallen, irregularly but persistently nonetheless,

over

the period under study in this paper. Pnother is that financial assets

have increasingly become negotiable, and those which have always been
negotiable

have become more liquid. A third is that, despite the potentially

very important episodes of retrogression, financial markets around the world
have in fact become more closely integrated.

In light of these changes in the role of monetary policy, in government
regulations and intermediation, and in private financial institutions and
practices, it would be astonishing if there had been no changes at all

-13-

in the relationships connecting money, credit and interest rates to U.S.

economic fluctuations. In the context of business cycles, however, as
opposed to a study of financial markets per se, what matters is whether

these (or still other) changes have brought about significant, and
economically important, changes in such relationships at the macroeconomic
level.

II. Basic

Cyclical

Relationships in Monetary and

Financa1

Data

The four panels of Figure 1 give an overview of the basic relationships
of four key monetary and financial variables to U.S. economic fluctuations
by showing these variables' annual variation from either 1891 or 1919 to the

present. The figure does not explicitly include any measure of
nonfinancial

economic activity, but the conventional shadings indicate

business contractions as designated by the National Bureau.
The top

panel of the figure shows the annual percentage change in

the money stock, measured both by the Friedman—Schwartz "old M2" concept
for

18 91-1975 and by the "new Ml" concept for 1919-82. The "old M2" measure

includes

currency held by the public plus "adjusted" total deposits at

commercial banks but not at nonbank depository institutions (and also,
since 1961, excluding large certificates of deposit) .
is

The "new Ml" measure

that adopted in 1980 (as "Mi-B") by the Federal Reserve System,

including currency held by the public plus all checkable deposits other than
those

held by foreign commercial banks and official institutions, and

as amended in 1982 to include travellers' checks.8 As is well known from
the work of Friedman and Schwartz (1963, 1970, 1983) and others, the

major historical fluctuations in U.S. nonfinancial economic activity have
been accompanied by often sharp fluctuations in the rate of money growth.
Prominent examples that stand out in the figure include the episodes of

negative money growth in 1921, 1931 and 1949, and the sharp slowing of money

growth in 1938. Especially during the post World War II period, however,
fluctuations in economic activity and variations in money growth have both
been more modest. The comovernent of money growth and real economic growth
has been less pronounced also, although it is still readily visible.

The

domestic

second panel of Figure 1 shows the annual percentage change in

nonfinancial credit, including the total outstanding credit

market indebtedness of all U.Spublic and private sector borrowers other
than financial intermediaries.9 As is documented in Friedman (1981, 1983a)
domestic nonfinancial credit has also borne a close relationship to U.S.

nonfinancial economic activity, especially in the post-war period. Even
before World War II, however, several major episodes of negative credit
growth, including those in 1921, 1931 and 1938, stand out as having
occurred in conjunction with recognized economic fluctuations.
The bottom two panels of Figure 1 show the annual average levels
of interest rates on prime 4—6 month commercial paper offered in New York,

and on Baa—rated corporate bonds, respectively.10 The main features that
stand out immediately in the interest rate data are the great volatility of
both short- and long—term rates before 1930 and after 1970, the extraordinarily
low level of both rates during the late 1930s and early 1940s, and the persistent
upward trend since World War II. Js is thoroughly familiar, however,
interest rates also fluctuate cyclically, and many of the recognized business
cycle episodes during this period also coincide with readily visible interest
rate movements.

Table 1 focuses more closely on the comovernents of both the 4l money stock

and domestic nonfinancial credit with economic activity by arranging seasonally
adjusted quarterly data in the context of the seven and one—half complete
episodes since World War II designated as contractions and expansions by the

National Bureau.11 For each designated contraction or expansion, the taJle
12

shows the average per annum growth rate of money and credit, respectively.

Despite the secular post—war trend toward faster growth of money and credit,

the

strongly cyclical aspect of both money growth and credit growth stands

out clearly in these summary data. Money growth in expansions has exceeded
money growth in contractions by nearly 1 3/4% per annum on average, while
credit growth in expansions has exceeded credit growth in contractions by

nearly 1 1/2% per annum on average. The basic cyclical regularity is much
more striking than these average differences suggest, however. Money growth
in each expansion was faster than in the preceding contraction, and money growth
was slower in each contraction than in the preceding expansion.

Similarly,

credit growth in each expansion was faster than credit growth in the preceding
contractions and credit growth in each contraction was slower than in the
preceding expansion.

Table 2 presents analogous data (not seasonally adjusted) for the

post—war cyclical levels and movements of short— and long—term interest

rates. Once again a secular post—war trend, toward higher interest rates
and larger (absolute) interest rate changes, stands out immediately.
Interest rates have also exhibited strong cyclical regularities, but they
are not so striking as in the case of money and credit growth.

Interest

rate levels have been lower in expansions than in contractions by about
3/4% on average, but there has hardly been uniformity in this respect.
In only two expansions were short—term interest rates lower than in the

previous

contraction, and in only one expansion was the long—term rate lower

(by more than a single basis point)
By contrast, the chief cyclical regularity that does stand out in

Table 2 is the rise of the short—term interest rate in every expansion and

the corresponding decline in every contraction. The 6 3/4% (algebraic)
difference between the average short—term rate

in expansions and in

contractions, respectively, dwarfs the small difference in the corresponding

average levels. The long—term interest rate has also risen in all seven
post-war expansions and declined in six of the eight contractions, although
here the (algebraic) difference for the respective average changes has
been much smaller, as most familiar theories of the pricing of long— versus
short—term assets imply.
In summary, both the annual data plotted in Figure 1 and the cycle-

specific averages of quarterly data shown in Tables 1 and 2 give the
impression of strong and persistent regularities in the monetary and

financial aspects of U.S. economic fluctuations. On closer inspection,
however, many of these regularities turn out not to be so regular or so

persistent after all. Although the investigation of these relationships
in a dynamic context is the subject of SectionslV and V below, Table 3 provides
a quick overview by showing simple correlation coefficients relating the
annual movements of the monetary and financial variables plotted in
Figure 1 to the annual percentage change in real gross national product.14
For the nonetary and credit aggregates, the table also shows analogous
correlations for the corresponding aggregates deflated by the gross national

Especially from the perspective of changes in monetary policy, other possible

Reserve System first began to employ explicit monetary aggregate targets

and also first began to suspend Regulation Q ceilings, and 1979 when the

Federal Peserve (temporarily) adopted new operating procedures. The
break at 1966 roughly separates the early post—war years of low price
inflation, stable real economic growth and few apparent "supply shocks"

from the subsequent years of rapid and accelerating price inflation, less
stable and on average slower real growth, an occasional large supply—
side

disturbances.

For each monetary or financial variable among the eight considered,

and for each separate time period, Table 3 reports the simple correlation
of the variable's annual percentage change (for interest rates, the absolute
change)

with the annual percentage change of real gross national product

for three lead—lag relationships: first with the monetary or financial
variable leading real growth by one year, next contemporaneously, and last
with that variable lagging real growth by one year.
In contrast to the appearance of strong regularities in Figure 1
and in Tables 1 and 2, the dominant impression given by these correlations
is the absence of systematic relationships that have persisted across the

different time periods under consideration.15 The only two consistently
significant relationships are the tendency of real M2 growth to be rapid
(slow) contemporaneously with rapid (slow) real growth, and of long-term
interest rates to fall (rise) in the year before a year of rapid (slow)
real

growth. Nominal Ml growth was strongly positively

contemporaneous

correlated with

real growth during the inter—war period, but less so during

either half of the post-war period considered separately and not at all
for

the post—war period overall. Peal Ml growth was strongly correlated

with contemporaneous real economic growth earlier on, but not during the

—19—

later post—war period. Neither nominal nor real Mi growth has shown a
significant lead or lag relationship to real economic growth on an annual

basis. Nominal M2 growth was strongly positively correlated with
contemporaneous

real growth during the pre—war and inter—war periods, but

not since World War II.
Nominal credit growth resembles nominal Ml

growth in being strongly

postively correlated with contemporaneous real economic growth during

the inter—war period and the early post—war period, but not for the

later post—war period or for the post—war period as a whole. For the
inter—war and early post—war periods, lagged credit growth has been

significantly correlated with real economic growth, although positively

in the former years and negatively in the latter. Ieal credit growth has
been
basis

positively correlated with real economic growth on a contemporaneous

throughout the post—war period, but it was not so earlier on.
Finally, both short— and long—term interest rate changes have

been negatively correlated with contemporaneous real economic growth, and

(except for short-term rates in the inter-war period) with the following
year's real growth, throughout the period under study here. Many of these
correlations are not significant, however. The contemporaneous relationship for

short—term rates is significant except for the inter-war years, and for
long—term rates it

in

is

so except for the early post—war period. The change

short—term rates has been positively correlated with the prior year's

real growth, but significantly so only during the pre--war and early

post—war periods.

Simple correlations based on annual data are a crude way of
summarizing economic relationships, of course, even when they allow for

—20—

modest leads or lags. Nevertheless, if the regularities connecting
monetary and financial variables to business cycles were sufficiently
powerful and persistent, they would be likely to show up more strongly

even in these simple correlations. That they do not is hardly the end
of the story, but the fact that it is necessary to look harder in order
to

find them is itself suggestive.

III. Money,

Credit

and

'\1ocity"

in Post-War Business cles

A subject that has run throughout the long standing literature
of monetary and financial aspects of economic fluctuations is the respective
roles in this context of money (or credit) and the associated "velocity"
defined simply as the ratio of nominal income to money (or, again, to

credit). Before examining the U.S.

experience

in this regard, it is

useful to point out the absence of any economic meaning of "velocity"

as so defined —

other

than, by definition, the income-to—money ratio.

Because the "velocity" label may seem to connote deposit or currency
turn—over rates, there is often a tendency to infer that "velocity"
defined in this way does in fact correspond to some physical aspect of
economic

behavior. When the numerator of the ratio is income rather

than transactions or bank debits,, however, "velocity" is simply a
ratio.

16

1s Table 1 shows for the post-war period, both money and credit
grow

faster on average during economic expansions than during contractions.

The issue of money or credit movements versus their respective "velocities,"

in

a business cycle context, is simply the distinction between movements

of nominal income that match movements of money or credit and movements

of income that do not, and hence that imply movements in the income—to—money
or income—to—credit ratio.
Table 4, using quarterly data for post-war cyclical episodes
exactly analogues to the money and credit growth averages in Table 1, shows

that the "velocity" associated with each aggregate has also exhibited

strong cyclical properties. Monetary velocity, which has had an upward
secular trend since World War II, has risen on average in each expansion

—22—

and has declined on average in six of eight contractions. The average
growth

of monetary velocity in expansions has exceeded that in contractions

by about 4 3/4% per annum, a much greater difference than the 1 3/4% per

annum shown in Table 1 for money growth itself. Credit velocity, which
has been trendless on average since World War II, has risen on average in

four of six expansions and declined on average in each contraction.
The average

contractions

growth of credit velocity in expansions has exceeded that in
by about 4 1/4% per annum, again a much larger difference

than the 1 1/4% per annum difference shown in Table 1 for credit growth.
Because

the numerator of the "velocity" ratio is nominal income,

while business cycle expansions and contractions typically refer to

fluctuations of real economic activity, it is difficult to go much further
in considering money, credit and their respective "velocities" in a business
cycle context without allowing for cyclical variation in price inflation.
As Table 5 shows, however, during the post-war period price inflation

has apparently followed the business cycle with a sufficient lag that
the movements of real and nominal gross national product during expansions

and contractions have almost exactly corresponded on average. Real
income, of course, has grown on average in each expansion and declined on

average in each contraction, with an (algebraic) difference of nearly 6%
per annum between the mean for all expansions and the mean for all contractions.

By contrast, because of the upward secular trend in price inflation, nominal
income declined in the first three post—war contractions but increased

in

the subsequent five. Even so, the difference between the average growth

of nominal income in expansions and contractions, respectively, has been

about 6 1/2% per annum — almost identical to the corresponding difference

and contractions, therefore, relationships to nominal income (like those

based on "velocity ratios) approximately carry over to relationships to
real income, and hence to economic fluctuations in the ordinary business
cycle

relationships by collecting

the means from Tables 1, 4 and 5 and the corresponding

variation

The

upper half of the table first decomposes the

of real income growth into components representing nominal

growth, price inflation and their covariance, and then decomposes the
variation of nominal income growth into components representing money
growth, "velocity" growth (that is, nominal income growth which does
not correspond to

money growth) and the associated covariance term.

The first column of the table applies this decomposition only to

contractions, treating each one as

a simple observation —

in other words,

asking what role money growth, "velocity" growth and price inflation have

played in accounting for differences between one business contraction and

another. The average (negative) real growth rate has varied little among
successive contraction episodes, so that the differences here are almost
entirely differences among respective contractions' rates of price inflation

and hence of nominal growth. The results show that money growth variations
have dominated velocity growth variations in accounting for these differences.
Analogous results presented in the second column show an even greater

predominance of money growth variations over velocity growth variations in
accounting for nominal income growth differences across expansions. The final
column of the table presents the results of an analogous decomposition applied
to all contractions and all expansions, again treating each as a single

observation

in other words, asking what role money growth, velocity

growth and price inflation have played in accounting for differences not
just among contractions or among expansions but also between contractions

and expansions. In this context the respective variations of money
growth and velocity growth have been more nearly coequal, and also importantly
correlated.
The

lower half of Table 7 presents the analogous three sets of

decompositions including credit and credit velocity." The results are
similar to those for money and money velocity shown above, but in each

case with a smaller role for the aggregate, and consequently a greater
role

for velocity. Variations in credit growth have predominated over

velocity growth variations only in accounting for differences among

expansions. For differences among contractions, the two have been
approximately coequal, and importantly correlated. Variations in credit
velocity, and its correlation with credit growth variations, have been
more

important than variations in credit growth per se in the broader

cyclical context of accounting also for differences between expansions and

contractions.

—25—

IV.

Dynamic Relationships

Simple annual correlations like those shown

in

Table 3 fail to convey

that it is important to know about the comovement of economic time series

in a business cycle context for at least three reasons. First, the relevant
lead—lag relationships may be distributed over either more or less than one

year. The work of Friedman and Schwartz (1963), for example, concluded that
variations in money growth typically lead variations in income growth by

less than a year. Second, even highly significant lead correlations may
merely reflect the interaction of contemporaneous (or even lagged) relationships

among time series that are individually autocorrelated. In contrast to the
propositions that characterized much of the earlier literature of monetary
and financial aspects of economic fluctuations, which typically referred simply
to the comovement among two or more variables, the modern analysis of business
cycles focuses instead on whether movements in one variable are systematically
related to those parts of the movements in another that are not purely

autoregressive. Third, the relationship of one variable to another may depend
on what further variables the analysis includes. The proposition that two
variables exhibit a stable relationship to one another without allowance
for

to

further variables implies either that other variables are unimportant

that relationship or that whatever other variables are relevant have

not varied (will not vary) significantly during the period under study.

The results presented in this section of the paper extend the simple overview

to the more traditional business cycle literature. Once again, however,
the chief impression given by these results is the absence of persistence
over time in familiar simple quantitative relstionships.

The often assumed relationship by which Ml growth helps explain
either nominal or real economic growth, but not vice versa, appears in
the results in Tables 8 and 9 only since World War II, and only when the

first half of the post-war period is included. Growth in M2 helps
explain nominal economic growth only before World War I, and does not
help explain real economic growth in this sense in any of the three periods

studied. Credit growth helps explain nominal income growth both in the
inter—war period and in the post—war period as long as the more recent

post—war years are included, but for the post—war period as a whole nominal

income growth also helps explain credit growth. Credit growth does not
help explain real income growth in this sense in any period. The change
in short—term interest rates helps explain both nominal and real income

growth, but not vice versa, in the pre—war period and in the second half of

the post—war period. The change in long—term interest rates helps explain
both

nominal

and real income growth, but not vice versa, in the inter—war

period and the first half of the post-war period.
It is important to distinguish these generally negative findings
from the more traditional propositions, noted and in some cases documented

above, about the comovement in a simple sense, including lead and lag

—27--

relationships, connecting income with familiar monetary

variables. As Figure 1 and Tables

and financial

1-3

and

financial

show, each of the five monetary

variables considered here has exhibited distinctly cyclical

movements, at least during some time periods. What the tests in Tables 8
and 9 seek to establish, however, is not just whether a variable has
fluctuated

in conjunction with movements in income but whether it has

shown a relationship to that part of the movement in income which is not

explainable in purely autoregressive terms. Even a readily visible simple
relationship to income fluctuations need not — indeed, evidently often
does not
imply a corresponding relationship to the elements of income

fluctuations that are not purely autoregressive.
More importantly, the basic theme of this paper focuses less on
what

helps explain what than on which if any quantitative relationships

have persisted across spans of time during which the U.S. financial markets

have

undergone changes like those reviewed in Section I, which at least in

principle could have importantly affected the
of

monetary and financial aspects

economic fluctuations. Table 10 presents further F-statistics testing

the null hypothesis of absence of structural change in the bivariate
relationships summarized in Tables 8

of

and 9,

against

the alternative hypothesis

breaks at World War II and at the mid-point of the post-war period to date

(and also, for relationships involving M2 and the short—term interest rate,

at World War I). In all but two isolated cases, the data indicate significant
structural change. What is especially striking in the results of these
stability tests is that even sets of coefficients which Tables 8 and 9 report
to be not significantly different from zero are nonetheless significantly
different

from one another.

Annual data, of course, may simply be too coarse to capture the

relevant

behavior connecting these aspects of aggregative economic

activity. Tables 11 and 12 therefore present F-statistics for analogous
bivariate exogeneity tests for the respective relationships of nominal and
real

income growth to the growth of mbney (Ml) and credit and the

change in short— and long—term interest rates, based on quarterly data for
the post World War II period.19 Money growth consistently helps explain
both nominal and real economic growth, as is familiar from previous work,

but these results show that either nominal or real income growth also

typically helps explain money growth (so that money does not 'cause'T income
in the Granger sense). Credit growth helps explain nominal income, but
not vice versa, in the second half of the post—war period. For the postwar period as a whole, credit growth again helps explain nominal income

those suggested in Section II.

real income growth at least in some periods, it is difficult to justify the

use of only bivariate relationships. Table 14 presents F—statistics for
analogous exogeneity tests based on a five—variable annual system including
real income growth, price inflation, money (Ml) growth, credit growth and
the change in the short—term interest rate, for the same inter—war and
post—war periods studied earlier.
Even with only three monetary and financial variables in the system,
however, it is difficult to draw any solid conclusions from this expanded

analysis. Among the three, only money growth significantly helps explain

real income growth — given the presence of the other included variables
in any period examined, and even this effect is evident only for samples
including the first half of the post—war period.20 At the same time, real
income growth helps explain both money growth and credit growth during the
full post—war period, and also helps explain money growth during the later

post—war years. Peal income growth only marginally helps explain the shortterm interest rate change. Once again, what significant regularities do
appear have not been regular enough to persist across different time periods.
The same generalization also characterizes analogous results for

multivariate systems estimated for the post World War II period using

quarterly data. There is little point in displaying vast quantities of
empirical results along these lines, since the basic lack of consistency
is readily apparent just from a summary

of

what does and does not help

explain real income growth in quarterly systems based on different sub—

periods. For the quarterly version of the same five—variable system shown
in Table 14, neither money growth nor credit growth nor the short-term
interest rate change significantly helps explain real income growth, even

for

1952:1—

l982:IV, 1952:I—1965:IV or 1966:I—l982:iV. By contrast, for the four—
variable system estimated for 1953:I-1978:iV in Friedman (1983a), including

all of the same variables as in Table 14 except the interest rate change,
money growth and credit growth each significantly help explain real

income growth at the .05 level.21 Similarly, for the six-variable system
estimated for 1962:111-1979:111 in clarida

and

Friedman (1984), including

the same variables as in Table 14 plus the change in the federal

government budget deficit, credit growth significantly helps explain real
income growth at the .01 level, money growth does so at the .05 level,
and the short-term interest rate change does so at the .10 level.22
Moreover, these multivariate relationships too show significant
evidence of instability from one time period to another, thereby
revealing that the instability of the bivariate systems documented in
Table

10 is not due to anything so sinpie as merely omitting a small number

of familiar variables. Table 15 presents F—statistics testing the null
hypothesis of absence of structural change in the five—variable annual
relationships summarized in Table 14, and in the corresponding quarterly

relationships, against the alternative hypothesis of a break between the
inter—war and post—war periods or between the first and second halves of

sum, neither using quarterly data in place of annual, nor using multivariate
systems in place of bivariate, nor doing both at once, overturns the
general finding of heterogeneity from one period to another in the monetary
and financial aspects of economic fluctuations.

Finally, because the very notion of business "cycles" suggests the
possibility of comovements that recur at possibly regular intervals, it is
interesting to see whether the frequency—domain properties of the comovements

studied

here can provide further information to supplement the time—domain

properties reported above. In particular, what light can the associated
frequency—domain properties of these data shed on familiar questions like

the "leads and lags" of monetary and financial aspects of economic fluctuations?
]\s would be expected, frequency—domain methods immediately confirm

the presence of strong cyclical comovements along the lines reported in

Section II. The top two panels of Figure 2 show

the respective power

spectra of rtoney growth and credit growth, estimated using the fuLl sets

of

available post-war quarterly data spanning 1947 :I-l982:IV

1952:I-l982:IV

at high

for money and

for credit.23 Both spectra display substantial "noise"

frequencies

say, 1.5 radians and above. More importantly from

the perspective of the questions addressed here, both also display
significant power at or near frequencies plausibly related to recognized
business

cycles. The record of seven complete cycles from the peak in

1948:IV to that in 1981:111 implies a mean cycle length of just under 19

calendar quarters, equivalent to a frequency of almost exactly 1/3 radian.
The spectra of both money growth and credit growth display sharp spikes at

just that point.

Closer
the

respective

analysis of these two power spectra indicates, however, that
frequency-domain properties of money and credit growth

are not identical. In the range of .20— .79 radian, corresponding to a

period

of 2—8 years, the value of the test statistic for the null hypothesis

of no difference between the two spectra is 3.90 (distributed normally with

22 degrees of freedom), indicating that the two spectra do differ

significantly at the .01 level.24 One way to explore further the nature
of

this difference in the frequency-domain properties of money and credit

growth is to examine their respective coherences with real income growth,

shown in the bottom two panels of Figure 2. Not surprisingly, both
coherences display increases at about 1/3 radian. In the same range of
.20— .79 radian, the coherence of real income growth with money growth is

.98 with standard error .01, while the coherence of real income growth with
credit growth is .96 with standard error .02.
In

25

the same vein as the analysis of lead and lag relationships via the

bivariate exogeneity tests reported above, a plausible question to ask in

this

context is whether these respective coherences indicate that either

money growth or credit growth, or both, tend to lead real income growth.

In fact, both do so, and credit

sonwhat more so, although the indicated

leads are both surprisingly short in comparison to those usually suggested
in the time-domain literature. Money growth leads real income growth by
phase

angle

a

of only .11 radian (or .35 quarter, based on the 20 quarter

midpoint of the 2-8 year range) with standard error .05, while credit
growth leads real income growth by .32 radian (or 1.02 quarters) with

standard error .06. Even so, the difference between these two leads is not
statistically significant. The value of the test statistic for the null

—33—

hypothesis of no difference between the two

coherences

radian range is only .39 (distributed as a t-statistic
freedom) ,

not

in the same .20— .79

with

22 degrees of

significant at any reasonable level.

In addition, in the same vein as the analysis of partial relationships

via the multivariate exogeneity tests reported above, a further plausible
question to ask in this context is whether the partial coherence of either
money growth or credit growth with real income growth is significantly

different from zero — in other words, whether either adds significantly
to explaining the frequency—domain properties of real income growth —

given the presence of the other. \s is largely consistent with the
time—domain

of

.20- .79

results, the answer is no in both cases • For

radian,

the values of the relevant test statistic (distributed

as an F-statistic with 2
additional

the same range

and 20 degrees

of freedom) are .04

for

the

role of money growth and .42 for the additional role of credit

growth. Neither value is significant at any reasonable level.

V. Statistical Significance and Economic Significance
The results of the stability tests reported in Tables 10 and 15 indicate
strong evidence of statistically significant differences, between one
time period and another, in both bivariate and multivariate relationships
summarizing the monetary and financial aspects of U.S. economic fluctuations.
For many purposes, however, the statistical significance of such differences
does not necessarily mean that they are significant in a broader economic

sense. After all, two corresponding coefficients, estimated for different
time periods, can differ by an amount that is statistically significant

but economically trivial if each is individually measured with sufficient

precision. In addition, in dynamic relationships involving several coefficients,
offsetting shifts in different coefficients can. leave important properties

of the resulting overall relationship unaffected.
The structural shifts in the monetary and financial aspects of the

u.s. business cycle experience reported above are signficiant not just

statistically but economically as well. Table 16 shows the full sets of
estimation results for the bivariate annual relationship between real income
growth and money growth summarized in the top panel of Table 9, for 1919-40,

1947—65 and 1966-82, respectively. As Table 10 shows, the data indicate
statistically signficant shifts in these two estimated relationships.
Comparison of the three full sets of results shown in Table 16 confirms that
these significant differences are typically due not to small changes in a
few precisely measured coefficients but to one or even several quite large
changes, sometimes even involving switches of sign.
Figure 3 shows the implications of the differences among these
respective sets of estimated coefficients for the overall relationship

between real income growth and money growth by tracing out the first ten
years of the dynamic response pattern exhibited by the solved—out (but not
orthogonalized) moving-average representation of each of the three estimated
bivariate autoregressions. The implied own—disturbance responses shown in
the

upper left and lower right panels of the figure are roughly similar

among the three systems, but the implied cross—disturbance responses

shown in the upper right and lower left panels diverge sharply and even
include differences in the direction of the initial responses.
Table 17 and Figure 4 present analogous sets of estimation results

and associated dynamic response patterns for the bivariate annual relationship
between real income growth and credit growth summarized in the middle panel

of Table 9. Here again large differences appear among corresponding
coefficients estimated for different time

periods,

as do readily visible

differences among the implied response patterns, especially for the respective

cross—responses. In addition, further results (not shown) indicate
similar large differences for systems relating the growth of either money

or credit to nominal income gowth1 as well as for systems relating either real or
nominal income growth to the change in short—term interest rates. Finally,
still further results (also not shown) indicate large differences in the
results for analogous systems based on quarterly data, estimated for
1947:I—l965:IV and

1966:I—1982:IV.

In sum, the differences between one time period and another that
characterize the monetary and financial aspects of U.S. economic fluctuations
have been significant both statistically and economically, reflecting major
differences in the magnitude as well as the timing of the comovements between
income and money, credit and interest rates.

vi. The Credit Ojcle
A final financial aspect of U.S. economic fluctuations that bears
investigation here is the familiar "credit cycle" by which the economy's

public and private sectors alternate over the business cycle in their

respective volumes of credit market borrowing. In brief, the basic idea
behind this familiar notion is that federal government reliance on the
credit market typically bulges when weakness in the economy enlarges the

government's budget deficit, while the private sector's borrowing does just
the

opposite as a

financed

consequence of the cyclical variation of typically debt-

spending. 2s a result, federal government borrowing is greater in

economic contractions than in expansions, while private sector borrowing is

greater in expansions than in contractions. This cyclical regularity is
broadly familiar in somewhat
forinalanalysis

general terms, although to date little if any

of it has appeared.

Table 18 summarizes the main outlines of this regularity by showing

the respective quarterly average growth rates of federal government debt and

the remainder of domestic nonfinancial credit (including the debt of state and
local governments) during

the six and one—half recognized business cycles

1953. In part because of the lag of federal tax receipts behind
fluctuations in economic activity, but also in part because of the upward
secular trend in the growth rate of federal debt outstanding (as budget
deficits have grown, while the level of federal debt outstanding has shrunk,
relative to nonfinancial economic activity), the basic regularity of the
since

cycle" is more uniformly descriptive of private than of public
borrowing.26 In four contractions out of six, average federal debt growth

was faster than in the preceding expansion, but the mean difference in

growth rates between contractions and expansions has been less than 1/2%

per annum. By contrast, private debt growth in each expansion has been
faster than in the preceding contraction, while private debt growth in
each

contraction has been slower than in the preceding expansion, resulting

in a mean growth rate in expansions fully 2% per annum greater than in

contractions.
Attempts

to analyze the dynamic aspects of these regularities using

the same time-domain results applied in Section IV yielded few interesting
results, but the corresponding frequency—domain results do bear inspection.
The top two panels of Figure 5 show the respective power spectra of

federal and private sector

debt growth, estimated using quarterly data for

1952:I-l982:IV. The spectrum for federal debt growth displays an obvious

spike at almost exactly the mean cyclical frequency of 1/3 radian, while

that

for private debt growth exhibits a large spike at a frequency only

moderately higher. In contrast to the results reported in Section IV for
the growth of money and credit, the respective frequency—domain properties

of federal and

private

debt growth do not exhibit significant differences.

In the range of .20—.79 radian, the value of the test statistic for the
null hypothesis of no difference between these two spectra is only .44
(distributed normally with 22 degrees of freedom), not

significant at

any reasonable level. The bottom two panels of Figure 5 show the respective
coherences of federal debt growth and private debt growth with real income

growth. Both show increases at about 1/3 radian, although the coherences
are smaller than those reported above for the growth of money and credit.
In the same range of .20— .79 radian, the coherence of real income growth

with federal debt growth is .36 with standard error .19, while the

coherence between private debt growth and real income growth is .77 with
standard error .09.

In addition to this evidence of regular comovements of federal and
private debt growth with real income growth at cyclical frequencies, the
associated phase relationships (corresponding to leads and lags in the

time domain) provide some support for the idea that private borrowing
activity helps in part to determine real income

while

the federal

government's budget posture reacts passively.27 Federal debt growth lags
real income growth by a phase angle of 1.47 radians (or 4.7 quarters)

with standard error .55, while private debt growth leads real income
growth by a phase angle of .97 radians (or 3.1 quarters) with a standard

error or .18. Despite the small standard errors,however, these apparent
differences are not statistically significant. The value of the test
statistic for the null hypothesis of no difference between the two
coherences in the same .20- .79 radian range is only .002 (distributed as

a t-statistic with 22 degrees of freedom).
Similar

negative results emerge from asking whether either federal

debt growth or private debt growth significantly contributes to explaining
the frequency-domain properties of real income growth in the presence of the

other.28 In the range of .20- .79 radian, the values of the test statistic
(distributed as an F-statistic with 2 and 20 degrees of freedom) for the
partial coherence of real income growth with federal debt growth and with

private debt growth — in each case taking the other as given — are

respectively 1.49 and .17. Neither is significant at the .10 level.
In sum, there is evidence of a "credit cycle" in the sense of regular
movements of federal and private sector debt growth, and regular comovements

—39—

of each with real income

growth, at cyclical frequencies. In addition,

there is some indication that private debt growth leads real income

growth while federal debt growth lags, but the differences between
these respective comovements are not statistically significant, nor does

either federal or private debt growth contain significant information
about real income growth beyond what is also in the other.

VI. Surnrnaf_Conclusions
There can be no doubt that economic fluctuations in the United
States have their monetary and financial side. The comovements among

money, credit,

interest rates and nonfinancial economic activity are

evident enough at the crudest eyeball level of inspection, as well as
in the results of sore sophisticated time— and frequency—domain exercises.
Moreover, many of these comoveitents have coincided with major historical

business cycle episodes.
On closer inspection, however, these monetary and financial aspects

of U.S. economic fluctuations exhibit few quantitative regularities
that

have persisted unchanged across spans of time in which the nation's

financial markets have undergone profound and far reaching changes.

The evidence for the absence of such persistent quantitative regularities
assembled in this paper shows major differences among the pre World
War I, inter—war, and post World War II periods, and between the first
and second halves of the post—war period. Evidence suggesting changes
from one period to another repeatedly emerges, regardless of whether
the method of analysis is simple or sophisticated, regardless of whether

the underlying data are annual or quarterly, and regardless of whether

the relationships under study are bivariate or multivariate. Moreover,
the differences between one period and another reported here are significant
not just statistically but economically as well, in the sense of major
differences in the magnitude and timing of cyclical comovements.
The paper's main message, therefore, is a warning against accepting

too readily —

either

as a matter of positive economics or for policy

purposes — the appearance of simple and eternal verities in much of the

—41—

existing literature of monetary and financial aspects of business fluctuations.
More complicated models involving many variables and/or nonlinear
relationships may have remained stable, but the evidence clearly shows that

simple linear relationships among only a few such variables have not.

From then until

passage of the National Banking Act in 1864, private commercial

banks were chartered exclusively by the individual states. Thereafter,
until 1914, federally chartered banks enjoyed a monopoly over the

banking

functions, like deposit taking, with state chartered banks.

6. The discussion that follows focuses narrowly on the financial
markets and therefore omits such important elements of the changing

role

of government as taxes, government spending, bankruptcy

arrangennts, and so on — all of which could importantly affect the
relationships between monetary and financial variables and levels of
economic activity.

7. The underying data are annual averages centered on June 30. From
1890 to 1907 the annual data are averages of quarterly figures.

From 1908 to 1945 they are averages of end-of-month data. From
1947 to 1975 they are averages of daily—average monthly data.

8. The underlying data, constructed for this paper, are annual
averages of monthly data, including end—of—month data through
1946 and daily-average data since 1947.

(The Federal Peserve has

constructed the official new Ml series back only to 1959.)

9. The underlying data are end—of—year data. The domestic nonfinancial
credit concept is roughly analogous to 8primary

securities"

in the

sense of Gurley and Shaw (1960).

10. The

data are annual averages of daily—average monthly data.

11. The expansion ending in 1948:IV officially began in 1945:IV, but

the analysis here and below excludes it

so as

to avoid any remaining

effects due to the wartime economy.
12.

The table excludes credit growth for the first contraction and
expansion

1952:1

because quarterly credit data are available only from

onward.

13. It is at first tempting to suggest that, given the upward secular
trend, the lower average levels for expansions are simply due to the

omission of

the expansion that began in 1982:IV; but any such

of course, be merely a forecast.

From 1929 to 1982 the underlying GNP data are the standard National

Income and Product Accounts estimates. From 1909 to 1928 the data are
U.S. Department of Commerce estimates which (in principle) are
analogous to the subsequent N.I.P.A. estimates at the aggregate level.
From 1890 to 1908 the data are Department of Commerce estimates based

15.

In addition, because the underlying variables are serially correlated,
the conventional statistical confidence levels indicated in Table 3
are

overstated.

16. See Cramer (1983), for example, for evidence on the different respective
movements of income and total transactions.
17.

The reason for calculating the relationships among the nonfinancial
variables

a second time in the lower half of the table is that

quarterly credit data are not available for the first post—war
contraction and expansion. The same point applies to Table 7 below.

18. The

underlying vector autoregressions include a constant term and

and two

lags

on each variable in each equation. The results for

analogous autoregressions also including a linear time trend are

broadly similar. (The most interesting difference to emerge on the
introduction of a time trend is that Ml no longer helps explain

nominal income.) Io lags appear to be sufficient to eliminate most,
if not all, of the serial correlation in the residuals of the

equations based on these annual data. Because each equation includes
lags on both variables, and therefore a rational distributed lag,

there is of course

process

no limitation on the length of lag in the economic

represented.

19. The underlying vector autoregression systems include a constant term
and four lags on each variable in each equation.

(The discussion

of lag length in footnote 18 applies here too.) Once again, the
results for analogous autoregressions also including a linear time
trend are broadly similar.

20. In this system the most interesting difference to appear on the
introduction of a time trend is that the one variable which
helps explain real income growth is not money growth but the change
in short—term interest rates.

21. In this system real growth in turn helps explain money growth but not
credit growth.

22. In this system real growth in turn helps explain money growth but not
credit growth nor the interest rate change.

23. This exercise relies on data for the full post—war period, despite the
time—domain

evidence of structural change within that period, so

as

to provide enough observations to make the frequency—domain analysis

sensible. Both spectra, as well as the coherences displayed below,
were estimated using a triangular window with bandwidth 11..
24.

I am grateful to Jim Powell for assistance in constructing the
tests,

and for calculating the test statistics and their

distributions, reported here and in Section VI below.

25. With the estimated coherences so close to unity, the calculated
standard errors are not well behaved.

26. See Friedman (1983b) for a discussion of the divergent trends in
federal deficits and federal debt outstanding in relation to economic

activity.

27. This idea is consistent with a cyclical role for "credit crunches.
It is also consistent with the fact that only some one—fourth

of the cumulative federal budget deficit incurred during the
period under study here would have emerged if the economy had

remained at "high employment" throughout; see again, for example,
Friedman (l983b).

28. The lack of significance here parallels the results of time—domain

exogeneity tests.
