A Stochastic Model of Investment, Marginal q
and

the Market Value of the Firm

ABS TRACT

This paper presents closed—form solutions for the investment and
valuation of a competitive firm with a Cobb-Douglas production function
and

a constant elasticity adjustment cost function in the presence of

stochastic prices

for output and inputs. The value of the firm is a

linear function of the capital stock. The optimal rate of investment
is an increasing function of the slope of the value function with respect
to the capital stock (marginal q).

A mean preserving spread of the distribution of future price increases

investment. An increase in the

scale

of the random component of a price

can

increase, decrease or not affect the rate of

the

sign of the covariance of this price with a weighted average of all

investment depending on

prices.

[i92]

and Abel [1983] have analyzed investment behavior in continuous time models in
which the price of output evolves according to an Ito process, and Abel demon-

strated that artman's results carry over to continuous time. This paper
extends Abel [19831 by incorporating several variable factors of production,
with stochastic prices, and analyzes the effects of increased uncertainty. Py
extending the model to include several stochastic prices, we

led to exam-

ine different types of increases in uncertainty. A payoff to this extension
is that we find that different types of (mean—preserving) increases in uncertainty can have qualitatively different effects on the rate of investment.

In analyzing the effects of increased uncertainty about prices, we exam-

ine two types of increase in uncertainty: (1) a mean—preserving spread, and
(2) an increase in scale. Althoug. an increase h! scale is a mean—preserving

spread for a scalar random variable, we

show that

for a raultivariate random

variable, an increase in scale is not, in general, a mean—preserving spread.

importantly, we show that these two types of increase in uncertainty
about prices have different effects on investment. As shown by rartman
[1972], a mean-preserving spread tends to increase investtnent; however, an

is a mean preserving spread.

ITowever, with several random variables, an

increase in the scale of one variable is a mean preserving spread if and only

if that variable is uncorrelated with all other random variables; if the variable whose scale is increased has a nonzero covariance with aw other random
variable, then an increase in scale is S a mean preserving spread.
The effects of an lIPS increase in uncertainty differ fran the effects of
an IS increase in uncertainty. We will show that, consistent with Fartman's
findings, an PPS increase in uncertainty will increase investment.

4.1 r1ean Preserving Spread

We follow Vartman's extension to several random variables of the
Pothschild—Stiglitz [19701 definition of a mean preserving spread. Specifi-

cally, if x is a random vector and if u is a random vector (with the same
dimension as x) such that H(ux) =
tor y =

0,

then the distribution of the random vec-

x+u is a mean preserving spread of the distribution of x.

Observe

that the covariance matrix of y exceeds the covariance matrix of x by a nonnegative definite matrix (we all ow some elements of u to be nonstochastic)

At

of an ?'PS increase in uncertainty is unambiguously positive, whereas the
effect on investment of an IS increase in uncertainty can be positive, nega-

uncertainty will raise, lower or leave unchanged the rate of investment
depending

on whether a certain covariance is positive, negative, or zero.

As a final comment on the effects of uncertainty, it should be emphasized

that it is uncertainty of relative prices which has an effect on investment.

If all w are perfectly (positively) correlated and have the sane proportional variance, then all relative prices

are non—stochastic. In this

case, the rate of investment under uncertainty is the same as under certainty.

5. The Required Rate of Return6

Up to this point our analysis of the firm's behavior has been conducted
under

the assumption of ri sk—neutral ity.

In particul ar, we have assumed that

the required rate of return on the firm's equity, r, remains unchanged when
the uncertainty of output price and factor prices is changed. It should be
noted that risk—neutrality

asset pricing model, the required rate of return on a

firm

of return on the firm is uncorrel ated with the return on

In the context of more recent asset pricing models of Lucas (197) and Breeden
(1979), the required rate of return on a firm will be independent of the vari-

If we drop the assumption that the return on the finn is uncorrelated
with the market portfolio (or with the narginal utility of consiniption), then

—20—
the

required rate of return on the firm is an increasing function of the

covariance of the firm's return with the return on the market portfol io. If

the increase in price uncertainty causes this covariance to inc-:ase, then the

Alternatively, if the increase in price uncertainty leads to a

decrease in the relevant covariance, then the required rate of return

It is clear that to reach any conclusions about the effect of uncertainty

have
