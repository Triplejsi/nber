The Investment Strategies of Sovereign Wealth Funds
Shai Bernstein, Josh Lerner, and Antoinette Schoar
NBER Working Paper No. 14861
April 2009
JEL No. G23,G24,H11
ABSTRACT
This paper examines the direct private equity investment strategies across sovereign wealth funds and
their relationship to the funds’ organizational structures. SWFs seem to engage in a form of trend chasing,
since they are more likely to invest at home when domestic equity prices are higher, and invest abroad
when foreign prices are higher. Funds see the industry P/E ratios of their home investments drop in
the year after the investment, while they have a positive change in the year after their investments
abroad. SWFs where politicians are involved have a much greater likelihood of investing at home
than those where external managers are involved. At the same time, SWFs with external managers
tend to invest in lower P/E industries, which see an increase in the P/E ratios in the year after the investment.
By way of contrast, funds with politicians involved invest in higher P/E industries, which have a negative
valuation change in the year after the investment.

1. Introduction
The role of sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) in the global financial system has been
increasingly recognized in recent years. The resources controlled by these funds—estimated to
be $3.5 trillion in 2008 (Fernandez and Eschweiler [2008])—have grown sharply over the past
decade. Projections, while inherently tentative due to the uncertainties about the future path of
economic growth and commodity prices, suggest that they will be increasingly important actors
in the years to come.

Despite this significant and growing role, financial economists have devoted remarkably
little attention to these funds. While the investment behavior of financial institutions with less
capital under management, such as hedge and private equity funds, have been scrutinized in
hundreds of articles, only a handful of pieces have sought to understand sovereign funds. The
lack of scrutiny must be largely attributed to the deliberately low profile adopted by many SWFs,
which makes systematic analysis challenging.

In this paper, we analyze whether there exist differences in investment strategies and
performance across sovereign wealth funds, focusing on their direct private equity investments.
Since it is generally believed that the private equity market is characterized by greater
information asymmetries than public markets, differences among institutions should be most
pronounced here. Moreover, it is one of the few dimensions of these funds’ investments that we
can obtain systematic information on. We analyze how SWFs vary in their investment styles and
performance across various geographies and governance structures.

2

After merging three publicly available investment databases, Dealogic’s M&A Analytics,
Security Data Company’s (SDC) Platinum M&A, and Bureau van Dijk’s Zephyr, we identify
2662 investments between 1984 and 2007 by 29 SWFs, including acquisitions, venture capital
and private equity investments, and structured minority purchases in public entities. We examine
the propensity of funds to invest domestically, the equity price levels at the time of their
investments, the changes in equity prices after their investments, and the size of the acquired
stakes.1

We find several interesting patterns in the data:


SWFs are more likely to invest at home when domestic equity prices are higher, and
more likely to invest abroad when foreign prices are higher.



On average, funds invest at significantly lower price-earnings (P/E) ratios when investing
at home and higher P/E levels outside. This result is mainly driven by Asian and MidEastern funds, while the opposite holds for Western funds.



Asian groups and, to a somewhat lesser extent, Middle Eastern SWFs, see the industry
P/E ratios of their home investments drop in the year after the investment, while they see
a positive change in the year after their investments abroad.



SWFs where politicians are involved in governance have a much greater likelihood of
investing at home, while those relying upon external managers display a lower likelihood.

1

Because many of the target firms in the sample are private, we examine the weighted average of
the price-earnings ratio of firms in the same industry, country, and year.
3



Once we control for the differing propensity to invest domestically, SWFs with external
managers tend to invest in lower P/E industries, while those with politicians involved in
the governance process invest in higher P/E industries.



Investments by SWFs with the involvement of external managers tend to be associated a
more positive change in industry P/E in the year after the deal, while for funds where
politicians are involved, the trend goes the other way round.

Taken as a whole, two competing interpretations can be offered for these results. It may
be that funds investing more heavily in their domestic markets, particularly those with the active
involvement of political leaders, are more sensitive to the social needs of the nation. As a result,
they might be willing to accept investments which have high social returns but low private ones.
Since the social returns are not easily observable to us, it would appear that these funds are
investing in industries with lower performance. The alternative interpretation would suggest that
greater investment at home is a symptom of poor investment decisions, since the funds are prone
to home bias or else to have decisions distorted by political or agency considerations.

It is difficult, however, to reconcile the first view with some of the results. In particular, it
is hard to understand why economic development needs would compel firms to invest
domestically when equity prices are relatively higher, which presumably should be a time when
capital constraints are less limiting. Similar, it is hard to explain why social welfare concerns
would lead politician-influenced funds would led to invest in the highest P/E industries,
especially in light of the negative returns that subsequently characterize these sectors. While

4

these results are only suggestive given the preliminary nature of the data, they raise a number of
important questions about the investment strategies and management structures of SWFs.

The plan of this paper is as follows. In the second section, we review relevant theoretical
perspectives and the earlier studies on SWFs. Our data sources and construction are described in
Section 3. Section 4 presents the analysis. The final section concludes the paper.

2. Theoretical Perspectives and Earlier Work
Numerous accounts by both objective observers and practitioners suggest that there is
substantial variation in the investment criteria and sophistication of institutional investors. In
particular, practitioner accounts suggest (e.g., Swensen [2009]), institutions often rely on overly
rigid decision criteria or lack a sufficient understanding of key asset classes. Observers attribute
these failures to underlying factors such as inappropriate incentives—for example, the limited
compensation and autonomy that investment officers enjoy, which leads to frequent turnover,
and a predilection to select ―safe‖ investments even if the expected returns are modest—and
conflicting objectives, particularly the pressures by fund overseers to invest in projects sponsored
by local entrepreneurs, even if the expected investment returns (and in some cases, social
benefits) are modest.

Recent papers by Gompers and Metrick [2001] and Lerner, et al. [2007] have highlighted
the enormous heterogeneity in investment strategies and ultimately returns across different types
of institutional investors. However, the evidence on SWFs is limited thus far due to many data
restrictions. In addition, SWFs are unique institutions: while these funds manage very large pools

5

of capital, their objective functions are often quite complex and do not only focus on financial
returns alone. On the one hand, sovereign funds face political pressures to further short-term and
local goals, as suggested in Shleifer and Vishny [1994]: e.g., to invest in local companies, rather
than saving for the long term. On the other hand, as nations become wealthier, their ability to
invest in government institutions grows. Moreover, citizens and businesses are likely to demand
better governmental services. As a result, nations with more wealth per citizen should have better
governance of their SWFs and a greater ability to use SWFs to further long term investment goals,
rather than being captured by government institutions.

A more focused body of work has looked at the rationales for and against state-owned
banks. These arguments concerning the involvement of the government in the financial sector
can also be relevant for the role of SWFs in an economy. Three alternative theories have
attracted wide currency:


The development perspective suggests that governments collect savings and direct them
toward strategic long term projects, overcoming market failures and generating aggregate
demand and foster growth. Hence state owned banks, unlike private banks, maximize
broader social objectives rather than just profits (Atkinson and Stiglitz [1980]; Stiglitz
[1993]).



The political perspective argues that politicians are self-interested individuals who pursue
their own goals, and hence state-owned banks enable governments to finance the
inefficient but politically desired projects, such as maximizing employment or financing
favored enterprises (Shleifer and Vishny [1994]).

6



The agency perspective argues, like the development perspective, that state owned banks
are created to maximize social welfare, but can generate corruption and misallocation
(Banerjee [1997]; Hart, et al. [1997]). The agency costs within government bureaucracies
can result in weak managerial incentives (Tirole [1994]). Under this view, state-owned
banks channel resources to socially profitable activities, but public managers exert less
effort (for instance, by diverting resources to advance personal ends or by taking steps to
facilitate obtaining future private sector jobs) than would their private counterparts.

Finally, a more recent literature looks specifically at sovereign wealth funds. Fotak, et al.
[2008] considers the financial impact of SWF investments in listed companies around the world.
They collect data from Securities Data Company (SDC), direct disclosures of SWFs, and
financial press. Their final sample contains of 75 investments in public firms by 16 SWFs in the
years 1989 to 2008. While they find an average abnormal return of +1% for targets on the day in
which the SWF investments are announced, over two years after the transaction, the abnormal
buy-and-hold returns average -41%. They find that this effect is not related to the size of equity
stake purchased by the SWF, and also does not differ across the various SWFs. They interpret
the results as indicative of the additional agency costs that the SWF impose on the companies
and cause with a deterioration of performance.

Le Borgne and Medas [2008] consider specifically SWFs in the Pacific island countries,
which are typically used to dampen the volatility of public revenues. While systematic data are
not available, the authors briefly describe the spending rules used by the governments, and the
funds’ governance structures. They suggest that the poor performance of these funds in achieving

7

their goals is related to the weakness of public financial management systems and the lack of
spending controls. In some cases, the rigid operational rules of the funds hindered their ability to
alleviate revenue volatility.

In other instances, the SWFs focused on achieving ambitious

financial returns, which led in some cases to risky investment profiles, mismanagement, and
substantial losses in assets.

3. Data Sources and Construction
To analyze the direct investment strategies of SWFs, we combine three sets of data:
information on the SWFs themselves, the direct investments that the funds made, and the
investment climate around the time of the transaction. The data for all the three components are
been drawn from publicly available sources.

SWF sample construction: We start with a preliminary sample of SWFs by combining
the profiles of the funds published by JPMorgan (Fernandez and Eschweiler [2008]) and Preqin
(Friedman [2008]). In the cases where the two databases use different names for the same SWF,
we employ the fund address and related information to eliminate duplicates. We add five funds
to the sample that were not included in these two compilations but are frequently described as
SWFs in at least one of the investment datasets noted below. This initial search yields a
population of 69 institutions, including some SWFs that have been announced but are not yet
active.

We then merge this initial sample of funds with the available data on direct investments
and characteristics of SWFs. We are careful to extract investment data for both the SWFs and

8

their ―subsidiaries,‖ which we define as entities in which SWF has at least a 50% ownership
stake. The two SWF directories and the investment datasets noted below did not always
explicitly note the links between SWFs and their subsidiaries. To extract transactions involving
SWF subsidiaries, we supplement our list of SWF subsidiaries by employing ownership data in
the Directory of Corporate Affiliations and Bureau van Dijk’s Orbis.

SWF Characteristics: The fund profiles in the JPMorgan and Preqin databases contain
information on the size and operations of the funds. If there was a discrepancy between the two
databases, we reconfirm the accuracy of the information through web searches and newspaper
articles. The key variables collected are:


Assets under Management—JPMorgan and Preqin profiles contain estimates of fund
sizes. In case of discrepancy, JPMorgan’s estimate of assets under management was
given preference. Preqin’s estimate of assets under management was used only when no
JPMorgan estimate existed.



The Presence of Politicians in the Managing Bodies—The JPMorgan report emphasizes
governance structures of funds. We form a dummy variable that indicates if a fund’s
JPMorgan profile contains evidence of presence of politicians in the governance of the
fund. For example, Khazanah Nasional’s JPMorgan profile indicates that the fund’s
board of directors ―has an eight-member Board comprising representatives from the
public and private sectors. Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, the Right Honorable Prime Minister
of Malaysia, is the Chairman of the Board of Directors.‖ Similarly, the Alaska Permanent
Reserve Fund’s profile indicates that the fund’s Board of Trustees ―is comprised of four
public members, the Commissioner of Revenue and one additional cabinet member of the

9

governor's choosing.‖ In other cases, the volume indicates that the governance of the fund
is in the hands of a board consisting of investment professionals and/or outside business
leaders.


Reliance on External Managers/Advisors—We create a dummy variable that is one if
either of our sources contain evidence that the institution relies on external management
or advisors. For example, the JPMorgan profile indicates that the Hong Kong Exchange
Fund ―employs external fund managers to manage about one third of the Fund’s assets,
including all of its equity portfolios and other specialized assets.‖

These measures, it must be acknowledged, have important limitations. First, these are reported as
of 2008: we do not have a time series on the governance of or advisor usage by the funds.
Second, these measures are extremely crude characterizations of the SWFs’ organizational
structures.

Investment Data: Information regarding SWF target investments is identified in
Dealogic’s M&A Analytics, SDC’s Platinum M&A, and Bureau van Dijk’s Zephyr. All three of
these databases compile information on direct investments by institutional and corporate
investors. Transactions included in the database encompass outright acquisitions, venture capital
and private equity investments, and structured minority purchases in public entities (frequently
called PIPEs, or private investments in public entities). The databases do not include investments
into hedge, mutual or private equity funds, or open market purchases of minority stakes in
publicly-traded firms.

10

For each of the three datasets, we run multiple acquirer name keyword searches
individually for every fund in the sample. We also search for investments carried out by their
subsidiaries. Finally, text fields of acquirer descriptions are searched for phrases such as ―SWF,‖
―sovereign fund,‖ or ―sovereign wealth fund.‖ These additional transactions are examined, and if
there is a match in the SWF’s identity (e.g., if there is a slight misspelling of the SWF’s name)
and location, the entries are added to the database. The variables we obtain about each deal are
the announcement date, transaction size, share of the equity acquired, and the country and
industry of the target. In the case of discrepancies across the databases, we use press accounts
and web searches to resolve the differences. Some of the databases include proposed deals that
were not consummated. If the transactions are described in the databases as ―withdrawn‖ or
―rejected,‖ we drop them from the analysis.

After merging the three databases, we are left with 2662 transactions between January
1984 and December 2007 by 29 SWFs. We confirm that the bulk of the funds that are not
included are either very new (indeed, some had not yet commenced operations by the end of
2007) or very small. Of the 29 institutions with transactions in our sample, 24 are profiled in
either the JPMorgan or Preqin volumes, or in both publications. There exist 23 JPMorgan and 16
Preqin profiles for the funds in our sample.

In the bulk of the analyses below, we also exclude 36 transactions where the targets were
in Central America, South America, or Africa. This decision reflects our desire to focus on
investments in the major markets—i.e., Asian, Middle Eastern and Western countries (North
America, Europe and Australia)—where the vast majority of the investments are concentrated.

11

Environment Data: We also characterize the pricing and subsequent returns in the
industry and the nation of the transaction. Ideally, we would have liked to analyze deal pricing
using the actual target firm’s P/E ratio. However, since most SWF’s investments are in private
firms, these data are not available.

Instead, we use:


Industry P/E ratios - To obtain a measure of deal valuations, we use the weighted average
of the P/E ratios of firms in the target company’s industry and company headquarters
nation. To calculate the P/E ratios for the target countries, we use the P/E ratios of public
companies in the same industry and country from the Datastream database, dropping
companies with negative P/E ratios. The main challenge was to get P/E ratios for Middle
Eastern targets, particularly in the Persian Gulf region. In 73 cases, we could not compute
a P/E ratio using the Datastream information. Weighted average P/E ratios were formed
for each target investment at the country-industry-year level (using market values of the
firms as weights). We used industry classifications based on the Standard Industrial
Classification scheme2 (for the distributions of investments by industries, see Table 1,
Panel E). The distribution of P/E values was winsorized at the 5% and 95% level in order
to reduce the impact of extreme observations. We also construct an approximate
performance measure for each deal: the change in the weighted mean industry-country
P/E ratio in the year following the transaction.

2

We use a broader definition than the 2-digit SIC level since under this classification the number
of companies per industry is very small in some target countries.
12



Home P/E and versus Outside P/E - To measure the P/E levels in the home nation versus
outside the nation, we construct Home P/E and Outside P/E variables using the MSCI
database (downloaded from Datastream). These ratios are weighted by market
capitalization and measured at the country-year level. We complete missing country-level
P/E ratios using the Zawya database and Datastream’s P/E indexes for emerging markets.
For investments made abroad, the variables Home P/E and Outside P/E correspond to the
P/E level of the home country of the SWF and the target country, respectively. If
investments are made at home, the Outside P/E variable equals the weighted average (by
the total amount invested by SWFs over the sample period) P/E ratios of all countries in
which investments were made by SWFs, excluding the home country.

4. Analysis
Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of the 2662 transactions made by the 29
sovereign wealth funds in our sample. Panel A of Table 1 sorts the funds into three regions: Asia,
Middle East,3 and Western groups. The Western group includes funds from North America,
Australia, and Europe. Our sample consists of seven funds in the Asian group, 15 funds in the
Middle Eastern group, and seven funds in the Western group. The number of transactions of
Asian funds (2046 observations) is substantially larger than the Middle Eastern group (532
observations) and the 84 observations of the Western group.

One possible explanation for these differences in sample size is that we have only partial
coverage of the deals. However, we believe that this can only explain part of the differences.
3

We add the single investment by the Venezuelan SWF to the totals for the Middle East, given
the petroleum-driven nature of that economy.
13

More important, we believe, are the differences in fund sizes and the willingness to engage in
direct investments. For example, the average Asian and Middle Eastern funds have $132B and
$124B under management, respectively, and are substantially larger than the average Western
fund ($40B).

While the sample consists of transactions between the years 1984 and 2007, more than
97% of the transactions are after 1991. While both the Asian and Middle Eastern funds’
investments go back to the mid 1980s, the Western funds’ investments are more recent,
beginning around 2003. Panels C and D show that the vast majority of direct investments of
Asian funds are in Asia itself (75.7%), but only 37.4% of the investments are made in the actual
home nation of the fund. Outside of the region, the Asian funds tend to invest in Europe and
North America. In contrast, Middle Eastern funds invest mostly outside of their region (only
16.5% of investments are at the same region and only 9% of investments are made in the home
country). Most of the investments of the Middle Eastern funds are made in Europe, North
America, and Australia (61.7%). Finally, all of the investments of the Western funds in the
sample are made in the Western region, with 94% of the investments in the home country.
However, we should highlight that the actual number of direct investments undertaken by
Western funds is significantly smaller than Asian and Mid-East ones.

We find that the average transaction size is $351 million, but there is substantial
heterogeneity between the funds. Middle Eastern funds, on average, have the largest deals, with
an average of $604 million, while Western funds have the smallest average deal size with only
$97 million per transaction. Similarly, the average acquisition stake of sovereign wealth funds is

14

substantial (56.59%). Parallel to above, the average stake of Middle Eastern funds is much larger
(62.2%) than in the Western funds (25.7%), with Asia in between the two.

Panel F shows that the average P/E level in the industry-country-year of the target of a
SWF transaction is 25.6. The Asian funds invest in industries with the highest P/E levels of 26.2,
while the Western funds’ investments have the lowest industry P/Es. If we measure the
performance of investments with the change in industry-country P/Es in the year after the
investment, Western funds fare best, with an average change of +1.2 following investments,
while the Middle Eastern and Asian have average shifts in P/Es of -1.21 and -1.17, respectively.
For the approximately 20% of the transactions where an equity security was publicly traded, we
also examine the market-adjusted returns in the six months after the transaction (see the detailed
description below). Here, the pattern appears to go the other way, with the poorest performance
by the Western SWFs’ investments.

The last panel of Table 1 reports variables that capture the governance structure of the
funds. Recall that for each fund, we develop indicator variables for whether politicians are
involved in the board and for whether the fund relies on external managers. About 24% of the
funds have politicians involved in the fund and 28% of the funds rely on outside managers. We
see that both funds with politicians and external managers tend to make larger investments.
Interestingly, when politicians are involved, funds invest more in the home country (44% of the
deals in the sample), relative to funds without politicians involved (only 31% of the
transactions). Funds with external managers involved invest less in the home country (8%)
relative to 36% for funds that do not rely on external managers.

15

We now analyze whether the characteristics of the SWFs are associated with differences
in their investment strategies. The main dimensions of SWFs that we investigate are:
1. the geographic region of the funds, that is, differences across SWFs in the Asian, Middle
Eastern, and Western groups, and
2. the governance structure of funds, i.e., whether the SWF relies on external managers for
investment advice and whether politicians are involved in the fund.
We will analyze investment strategies of SWFs based on their propensity to invest at home, the
industry-country P/E levels at the time of the investments, the subsequent changes in the P/E
ratios, and the size of the acquisition stakes of their investments.

The unit of observation in our analysis is at the transaction level (that is, for a specific
SWF and target), with standard errors at clustered at the level of the nation in which the fund is
based.

In many regressions, we control for the year that the investment is made and the

sovereign wealth fund making the investment.

In most specifications, we use weighted

regressions, with where each observation weighted by the transaction size (transaction sizes are
all expressed in 2000 U.S. dollars). Since we only have sizes for 67% of our transactions, we
impute missing weights by constructing the fitted values from a regression of deal sizes on fixed
effects for the investment year, target industry, target region, and fund. After adding imputed
observations, we winsorize the deal size variable at the 5% and 95% level, in order to reduce the
impact of extreme observations.4

4

We report unweighted regressions in the Appendix.
16

Propensity to invest at home
In order to analyze how funds vary in their allocation of investments between the home
nation and outside, we estimate a weighted probit model where the dependent variable is a home
investment dummy. This dummy variable is one if the target investment is made within the home
nation of the SWF and zero otherwise.

In Table 2, column (1), we regress the home dummy on indicator variables for the
geographic location of the SWF (Asian, Middle Eastern, and Western), controlling for the home
country’s gross domestic product (expressed using the logarithm of GDP, again in 2000 U.S.
dollars) and GDP growth in the calendar year prior to the year of the investment. The Western
group is omitted from the set of geographic dummies. We find that Asian and Middle Eastern
funds are significantly less likely to invest at home (by 31.4% and 37.4%, respectively) relative
to Western funds. This result continues to holds when controlling for year fixed effects in
column (2). This result might not be too surprising, since SWFs in Asia and the Middle East are
very large relative to the size of the local economies, which is different from the situation for
Western SWFs. So one could conjecture that Asian and Middle Eastern funds are almost
mechanically forced to invest outside their home nations.

To get a better understanding of the decision to invest in the home nation or invest
outside, we look at how the allocation of capital by SWFs responds to the pricing levels at home
and abroad. As noted above, in case of an outside investment, the Outside P/E level is the P/E
ratio in the target country in the year of the investment. In cases of a home investment, Outside
P/E is equal to the average (weighted by total transaction amounts) P/E ratio in the year of

17

investment of all other countries in which investments were made by SWFs during the entire
period analyzed.

The results in column (3) show that the Home P/E level significantly affects the
likelihood of investing at home, but in a manner that may be puzzling. SWFs are more likely to
invest at home when prices there are relatively higher. The magnitude of this effect is substantial:
an increase of one standard deviation of Home P/E increases the likelihood of investing at home
by 6.69%. Similarly, higher P/E levels in the other countries are correlated with a lower
propensity to invest at home. An increase in one standard deviation of Outside P/E decreases the
likelihood of investing at home by 3.11%. If we add year fixed effects in column (4), the
coefficient on Home P/E is still positive, but much smaller and insignificant. The coefficient on
the Outside P/E becomes significant at 1% level and the magnitude is larger. Finally, the results
hold even when we add group dummies in columns (5) and (6). We verify that the results hold
with equally weighted regressions in the appendix.

The cross-sectional results suggest that SWFs invest less at home if their local equity
markets have relatively low P/E levels. One possible explanation for this pattern is that SWFs
shun low-valued local markets because these financial markets are not as well developed. But
this hypothesis has difficulty explaining away the fact that the propensity to invest at abroad
increases as the pricing level in foreign markets rises. Rather, it appears more consistent with a
second explanation: the SWFs tend to ―trend chase,‖ that is, to gravitate to markets where equity
values are already high.

18

The determinants of industry P/E levels, performance, and acquisition stake
In a second step, we examine whether there are significant differences in investment
strategies across funds. More specifically, we analyze whether funds vary in their propensity to
time industry valuation cycles (measured as industry-nation P/E levels at the time of investment
and the change in P/Es in the year after the investment).

Industry P/E levels – In Table 3, we focus on the industry-nation P/E in the sector and
year of the transaction as the dependent variable. In column (1), we estimate a weighted ordinary
least squares (OLS) regression of the mean P/E ratio on the dummy denoting whether the
investment is in the home country. Standard errors are again clustered at the level of the country
of the SWF. We find a large negative and statistically significant coefficient on the home
investment dummy (-5.97), with a standard error of 2.6. While Table 2 showed that home
investments by SWFs are more likely when domestic P/E ratios are relatively higher, domestic
markets are still cheaper. In column (2), we see that this result is unchanged if we add dummies
for the different regions in which the SWF is based (Asia and Middle East, with the West again
serving as the reference group). The coefficients on the indicators for Asian and Middle Eastern
groups are not significant and close to zero.

In column (3), we add interaction terms between the home investment dummies and the
group indicators. These interactions allow us to explore whether the negative home investment
effects varies across the groups of SWFs. We see that the home investment dummy now turns
positive and significant. This implies that SWFs in the Western group choose industries with
higher P/E ratios when investing at home, while both Asian and Middle Eastern funds choose

19

investments with substantially lower P/E ratios at home (the coefficients on the interaction terms
are -6.8 and -8.5, respectively). We also see that the direct effect of Asia and ME is now positive,
which suggests that these funds are investing in targets with higher industry P/E ratios when
going abroad. These results are also significant when we substitute fund fixed effects for group
dummies in column (4).

Finally, in columns (5) and (6) we add dummy variables for the region of the target
investments, in order to control for overall valuation levels in each region. We see in column (5)
that the coefficient on the interaction between home investment and Asian group does not change
when we include the target controls, suggesting that Asian funds investing at home do so at a
lower industry P/Es than other sovereign funds who invest in Asia. This distinction is less
significant for the Middle Eastern funds: the coefficient on the interaction between home
investment and Mid-East groups drops by almost 80% once we add the target controls. In
column (6), we repeat the same regression but add year fixed effects. The results are unchanged
from column (5). These results are even more significant in the equally weighted regressions.

Overall these results suggest that funds from different regions (Asian, Middle Eastern,
and Western) do not vary significantly in the average P/E levels of the sectors in which they
invest. However, there is a sharp distinction when looking at domestic versus outside deals. On
average, funds invest at significantly lower P/E levels when investing at home and higher P/E
levels outside. But this result is mainly driven by Asian and Middle Eastern funds, while the
opposite holds for Western funds.

20

By themselves, these results could be consistent with two separate and diametrically
opposed interpretations. First, SWFs might have lower P/E ratios in their home investments since
they have better information about these markets and thus are able to invest at more favorable
valuations. This interpretation fundamentally relies on the belief that it is possible to time market
cycles. A second, alternative explanation relies on the assertion that P/E levels are true
reflections of the investment opportunities of firms. Under that assumption, lower P/E levels at
home would mean that SWFs are willing to invest in firms with lower investment opportunities
in their home country.

To shed some light on these two competing interpretations, we now look at the
performance of equities in the industry and country in the year after the deal. If the first
interpretation is true, we should see Asian and Mid-East SWFs outperform at home, while the
opposite would hold under the second explanation.

Performance – Table 4 is structured to be parallel to Table 3, but now with the change in
mean P/E ratio of firms in that country and industry in the year following the investment as the
dependent variable. In column (1), we regress the change in the industry-country P/E ratio in the
year after the investment on a dummy for home investments. We find that the home investment
dummy is negative but insignificant. When adding indicator variables for Asian and Middle
Eastern groups in column (2), we see that the coefficient on the home investment does not
change. The coefficient on Mid-East groups is negative and significant, which suggests that
overall these groups do not seem to be able to time industry trends.

21

In column (3), we now add interaction terms between group and home investments.
Interestingly, the coefficient on the interaction terms for both Asian and Middle Eastern groups
are negative and economically important, but only significant for the case of Asia. However, the
direct group effects for the Mid-East and Asia are now positive and significant. Similarly, the
coefficient on the home investment variable, which captures the change in industry P/E of the
Western groups’ home investments, is significantly positive. In column (4), we again substitute
group dummies with fund fixed effects and see that the signs of the interaction terms remain
unchanged but the significance is higher: domestic investments by both Asian and Middle
Eastern groups underperform their other transactions. In columns (5) and (6), we add dummies
for the target region and the main results are unchanged. The results described here also hold in
unweighted regressions, although some of the interaction terms are less significant.

The results in Table 4 suggest that Asian groups and, to a somewhat reduced extent,
Middle Eastern SWFs see the industry P/E ratios of their home investments drop in the year after
the investment, while they experience a positive change one year out for their investments
abroad. In contrast, Western groups see a more positive change in industry P/E one year out in
their home investments relative to the ones abroad. These results suggest that while Asian and
Middle Eastern SWFs invest in lower P/E industries at home, they do not seem to have a
differential ability to time these industry trends, since the ex post change in the P/E ratios in the
year after the investment is negative. This finding might suggest that the lower P/E investments
at home for Asian and Middle Eastern groups is a reflection of generally lower prospects for
local firms, rather than informational advantages at home.

22

We also undertake a robustness check of the performance regressions, by examining the
returns of the subset of firms that were publicly traded at the time of the SWF investment. We
search the Datastream database for all target companies that were publicly traded, and extract
their monthly returns. We determine the benchmark returns for the stock exchanges in which the
target companies were traded and extract those returns as well. We compute cumulative
abnormal returns relative to the benchmark in the six months after the transaction, which leads to
a considerably larger coverage than one-year returns (many of the 2007 investments did not have
one year of performance data due to reporting delays).

We estimate in Tables 5 and A-5 weighted and unweighted ordinary least squares
regressions similar to those in Table 4 and A-4, but now with the difference between the return
of the target in the six months after the transaction and the return of the corresponding
benchmark over the same period as the dependent variable. We use 538 observations in these
estimations. We find once again that in the basic regressions that the home investment dummy
has a significantly negative coefficient. When we add interactions between the home dummy and
the group location, we find the home dummy becomes significantly positive. The interactions
between the dummy variables for Asian and Middle Eastern groups and home investments are
again negative. The interaction with the Asian groups is significant across all the specifications
that we estimate. The significance of the interaction with the Mid-East groups falls, however,
when we add controls for the location of the target. While the sample of publicly traded
transactions is considerably smaller, the similarity to the results in Table 4 is reassuring.

23

Acquisition stake – Finally in Table 6, we explore how the size of the acquisition stakes
varies between groups. We use equally weighted regressions here, since weighting based on deal
sizes will bias our results. Again, the set-up of the table is parallel to the specifications in Tables
3 and 4. Column (1) shows that there is no significant difference in the size of acquisition stakes
between home or outside investments. However, columns (2) and (3) show that Asian and
Middle Eastern funds tend to acquire significantly bigger stakes in their target companies than
Western funds. We see that Asian funds acquire approximately 30% larger stakes in their targets
companies relative to Western funds, and Middle Eastern funds acquire 37% larger stakes.

In column (4) we add target region dummies. Interestingly, funds acquire significantly
smaller stakes in Asian countries relative to Western countries (23% smaller stakes in target
companies). This is also true with respect to Middle Eastern target investments, although with a
smaller magnitude. This effect also holds in column (5), when we substitute group dummies with
fund fixed effects, although the Mid-East target variable is no longer significant. Finally, it is
interesting to note that, when controlling for target regions, the home investment dummy turns
positive and significant at the 1% level.

Governance structure and the propensity to invest at home
We now turn to analyzing whether the variations in governance structures across funds—
that is, whether politicians or/and external managers are involved in investment decisions—are
associated with differences in the investment behavior of SWFs.

24

In Table 7, we look at the correlation between the likelihood of allocating capital at home
or abroad and the involvement of politicians and external managers. As in Table 2, we estimate a
weighted probit model and regress a home investment dummy on the same covariates, but add
dummies for politicians’ involvement and reliance on external managers. Column (1) shows a
stark difference between SWFs where politicians and external managers are involved in
investment choices and those where they are not. Funds where politicians are involved show a
36% higher likelihood of investing at home. In contrast, funds where external managers are
involved have a significantly lower propensity to invest at home (a decrease of 26%). These
results are very robust to adding the usual covariates we included before, as can be seen in
columns (2) through (8). Note that the results reported in Table 2 remained unchanged after the
addition of dummy variables for the involvement of politicians and external managers. These
results are also unchanged when we estimate non-weighted regressions.

Governance and industry P/E levels, performance, and acquisition stake
Industry P/E levels. In Table 8, we investigate whether there are significant differences in
the industry-country P/E levels of investments where politicians and/or external managers are
involved in the fund. In column (1), we regress P/E levels on dummies for politicians and
external managers. We find that coefficient on the politician dummy is positive, and negative for
the external managers one. But the results are insignificant. The same results hold when we add
group dummies in column (2).

However, when we add a control for home investments in column (3), the estimated
effects for external managers and politicians become significant at the 1% level. These effects

25

are also economically meaningful: funds where politicians are involved make investments whose
P/E levels are 4.5 higher; while funds with external managers have on average a P/E level 5.0
lower. In column (4), we see that these results also hold when controlling for the region in which
the target is located. The inclusion of the home dummy is important because, as we saw in Table
7, funds with politicians involved tend to favor home investments (which have lower P/Es). Once
we control for the investment mixture, we see that funds involving external managers tend to
invest in lower P/E sectors, while politician-influenced ones favor higher P/E ones.5

Performance. To disentangle the possible differences between the investment strategies
of funds involving politicians and external managers, we also look in Table 8 at the change in
P/E ratios one year out. Column (5) shows that the estimated coefficient for external managers is
positive and significant (2.6). Meanwhile, the relationship between subsequent changes in
industry P/E and involvement of politicians in the fund is the opposite: the estimated coefficient
on the politicians variable is -3.9, with a standard error of 0.6. These results are robust to the
inclusion of group dummies, home investment dummies, and target region dummies, as
demonstrated in columns (6) through (8).

In the unweighted regressions, the results for

politicians are unchanged, but the coefficients on the external managers variable are not
significant. Overall, the results suggest that investments by external manager-influenced funds
are associated a more positive change in industry P/E in the year after the deal, while in funds
where politicians are involved, the trend goes the other way.

5

However, one should note that these results are not robust to the estimation of unweighted
regressions, which suggest that these findings are driven by larger acquisitions.

26

It is ultimately difficult to know whether these discrepancies in performance are a result
of differences in the sophistication of the politician- versus external manager-influenced funds,
or whether funds where politicians are involved face more pressures to direct capital to
investments where the social returns are likely to be higher (but the private ones lower). It is
somewhat challenging, however, to reconcile the second hypothesis with the results in Table 2. If
politicians are directing funds to make investments in troubled local companies, we would
anticipate that these investments would accelerate at the times when they were performing the
worst: that is, when the P/E of local firms in the same sector was particularly low. Instead, the
opposite pattern appears.

Acquisition stakes. In Table 9, the dependent variable is the acquisition stake. As in Table
6, we estimate an unweighted OLS regression. As is clear from column (1), the involvement of
external managers (again, recall this is recorded at the fund level as of 2008) leads to smaller
acquisitions. The coefficient on the external managers’ dummy is -0.13, and is significant at the
1% level. The impact of politicians on the size of acquisition stake is much weaker. While it is
still significant in column (1), its magnitude is substantially lower (-0.03). Moreover, the
coefficient on the politician variable is not significant in the subsequent specifications. The
impact of external managers on the acquisition stake remains economically and statistically
significant when we include group dummies, a home investment dummy, and target region
controls.

5. Conclusions

27

This paper documents a number of interesting differences in the investment strategies
across sovereign wealth funds and their relationship to the funds’ organizational structures. We
analyze the direct private equity investments of SWFs, since we believe that due to the lower
degree of efficiency in these markets, differences in strategies will be more pronounced here.
Moreover, it is one of the few dimensions of SWF investments on which we can obtain
information.

Overall we find several patterns when comparing investments at home and abroad.
SWFs seem to engage in a form of trend chasing, since they are more likely to invest at home
when domestic equity prices are higher, and invest abroad when foreign prices are higher. Funds
see the industry P/E ratios of their home investments drop in the year after the investment, while
they have a positive change in the year after their investments abroad.

SWFs where politicians are involved have a much greater likelihood of investing at home
than those where external managers are involved. At the same time, SWFs with external
managers tend to invest in lower P/E industries, which see an increase in the P/E ratios in the
year after the investment. By way of contrast, funds with politicians involved invest in higher
P/E industries, which have a negative valuation change in the year after the investment.

Taken as a whole, our results lend support to the idea that high levels of home
investments by SWFs, particularly those with the active involvement of political leaders, are
associated with trend chasing and worse performance. This could be an outcome of less
sophisticated decision structures within these funds or outright distortions in the investment

28

process due to political or agency problems. This interpretation is also supported by our finding
that politician-influenced funds invest in the highest P/E industries.

While these results are only suggestive, given the preliminary nature of the data, they
raise a number of important questions about the investment decisions and management structure
of SWFs. A logical extension of this analysis would be to investigate the strategies of SWFs
across a wider set of asset classes. Such an analysis, however, would be challenging given the
opacity of many of these funds. More generally, we believe that much interesting work remains
to be done in understanding the underlying investment objectives of SWFs, their investment
strategies, and organizational differences, as well as the constraints they face due to internal and
external pressures. For example, many reports suggest that SWFs are often employed to further
the geopolitical and strategic economic interests of their governments. A recent example is the
emphasis of Singaporean SWFs on investing into India and China, which has been interpreted as
forging strategic ties with the city-state’s larger and more powerful neighbors. In other cases,
political considerations have led to the abandonment of prescient investment strategies, as when
the Norway’s Government Pension Fund caused an uproar in 2006 by shorting the shares of
Icelandic banks. Thus, SWFs present an ideal object of investigation to understand the
interaction between finance and political economy.

Appendix: Discussion of Supplemental Analyses

We also undertake a variety of supplemental tests to explore the robustness of the results.
In Table A-1, we conduct simple weighted mean tests. As noted earlier, SWFs commonly invest
in private entities. Therefore we use industry price-earnings ratios in target countries to measure
performance. For each target company, we calculate the weighted P/E ratio of firms in the same
industry and country in the year in which the transaction was made. Performance is measured by
the change in the weighted mean of the P/E ratio in the year following the transaction. We
eliminated the small number of transactions in target countries in Central America, South
America, and Africa.

First, we compare groups’ investments across different regions. Panel A.1 demonstrates
that there is significant heterogeneity between the groups in terms of the mean industry-country
P/E ratios. The Asian funds’ weighted average of P/E ratio level is the highest at 25, relative to
23.48 for Middle Eastern funds and 19.96 for Western funds. Note that the differences between
the reported averages in Table A-1 with the summary statistics in Table 1 are a result of
weighting transactions by deal sizes.

Asian funds invest in higher P/E level industries.

Moreover, Asian funds, similar to Middle Eastern funds, invest in sectors with substantially
lower P/E ratios in the Middle Eastern region and higher P/E ratios in Western targets.

When calculating performance as weighted averages, we see in panel A.2 that funds in
general face sharp drops in the year following investments. This is especially true for
investments in Middle East targets (the one-year change in industry P/E in the Middle East

31

region is -4.1). We see that the Asian funds perform better than the Middle Eastern group,
although the differences are not significantly better in a specific region. There are no significant
differences between the performance of Asian and Western funds. However, in the non-weighted
mean tests (not reported here), the Western funds outperform the Asian funds. This suggests that
the Western funds are especially successful at selecting small investments.

We then consider the investment selection and performance of funds at home versus
abroad. As we see in panel B.1, the three groups differ significantly in terms of the choice to
invest at home. While 94% of the Western funds’ investments are in their home country, only
9% of the investments of Middle Eastern funds are in the home country. The Asian funds’
investments are somewhere in the middle, with 37% of investments made at home. Despite
these differences, the P/E levels of industries selected for investment at home by Middle Eastern
and Western funds are not significantly different. However, the Asian funds seem to invest at
home at significantly higher P/E ratios relative to the other groups. When investing abroad, the
Asian funds invest at the highest P/E ratio (25.9, on average) relative to 23.9 of the Middle
Eastern funds. These are significantly different. Interestingly, there are substantial differences
between the P/E levels funds choose to invest at abroad versus at home. Both Asian funds and
Middle Eastern funds invest in industries with significantly higher P/E ratios when investing
abroad, while Western funds invest in substantially lower P/E sectors abroad.

In terms of performance of investments at home versus abroad, in panel B.2 it is evident
that Western funds significantly outperform the Asian and Middle Eastern funds when we
consider performance at home. There are no significant differences between the Asian and

32

Middle Eastern investments at home. The difference is substantial when we explore investments
abroad. The Asian funds significantly outperform both the Middle Eastern and Western funds
when investing abroad. Finally, Asian and Middle Eastern funds perform better abroad relative
to their performance at home, while the Western funds perform substantially better at home.

In panel C, we consider the impact of politicians’ involvement in the fund or a reliance
on external managers. Interestingly, it seems that the main impact of external managers or
politicians in terms of investment selection is on the choice of whether to invest at home. The
involvement of politicians increases the likelihood of investing at home: 44% of transactions are
made at home (relative to 31% for funds without politician involvement). However, when
external managers are involved, only 8% of transactions are made at home (relative to an average
of 36% to funds without external manager involvement). Finally, neither the involvement of
politicians nor that of external managers seems to have a substantial impact on the selection of
industries’ P/E levels. However, funds with politicians involved perform worse than other funds.

Tables A-2 through A-5, A-7, and A-8 repeat the regressions reported in the text, but now
using unweighted data. (Because Tables 6 and 9 use unweighted data, variants of these tables are
not presented.) The results are largely the same. When there are significant deviations between
the unweighted and weighted data, we note these in the body of the paper.

The dependent variable is a dummy denoting whether the investment target was based in the same nation as the SWF. The variables
Orig log(GDP) and Orig GDP growth represent the logarithm of the GDP in the year of the investment and the growth of the GDP in
the calendar year prior to the investment in the SWF’s home country. Group ASIA and Group ME are dummy variables equal to 1
when a fund is based in Asia or the Middle East. The Home P/E variable is the country-level P/E ratio of home country. The Outside
P/E variable is equal to the target country P/E ratio if investment is not in the SWF’s home nation. If investment is at home, Outside
P/E is equal to the average (weighted by the total transaction sizes of the SWF deals in the sample) P/E ratios of all other countries in
which investments were made by SWFs. The estimation method is a weighted probit model, using as weights winsorized transaction
sizes (converted to 2000 U.S. dollars). The displayed coefficients are marginal effects. Robust standard errors, allowing for data
clustering by the countries in which the SWFs are based, are shown in parenthesis. When year dummies are added, the sample only
includes transactions from 1991 onward.

Table A-2
The sample consists of 2662 investments by 29 Sovereign Wealth funds. It excludes transactions which were withdrawn or rejected.
The dependent variable is a dummy denoting whether the investment target was based in the same nation as the SWF. The variables
Orig log(GDP) and Orig GDP growth represent the logarithm of the GDP in the year of the investment and the growth of the GDP in
the calendar year prior to the investment in the SWF’s home country. Group ASIA and Group ME are dummy variables equal to 1
when a fund is based in Asia or the Middle East. The Home P/E variable is the country-level P/E ratio of home country. The Outside
P/E variable is equal to the target country P/E ratio if investment is not in the SWF’s home nation. If investment is at home, Outside
P/E is equal to the average (weighted by the total transaction sizes of the SWF deals in the sample) P/E ratios of all other countries in
which investments were made by SWFs. The estimation method is a probit model. The displayed coefficients are marginal effects.
Robust standard errors, allowing for data clustering by the countries in which the SWFs are based, are shown in parenthesis. When
year dummies are added, the sample only includes transactions from 1991 onward.
