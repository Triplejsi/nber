Measuring the Benefits of Product Variety with an Accurate Variety Set

JEL No. F12,F23,L16
ABSTRACT
Recent studies have used import data to assess the impact of foreign varieties on prices and welfare
for a home country. The reliance on import data has a number of limitations. First, these papers rely
on goods categories defined by the Harmonized System. Second, they define varieties using the Armington
assumption that all imports coming from a particular country are one unique variety. Third, they ignore
variety changes that may occur through foreign affiliate activity. In this paper, we revisit this literature
by employing a detailed market-based data set on the U.S. automobile market that allows us to define
goods varieties at a more precise level, as well as discern location of production and ownership of
varieties. We show that estimated variety changes and their impacts on U.S. prices and welfare differ
markedly for automobiles depending on whether one uses the standard import data or our more detailed
market-based data. The import data and Armington assumption hide significant net variety change
leading to a downward bias in the effects of net variety change, with implied welfare benefits only
half what we find with our market-based data. We also show that the welfare gains from all foreign-owned
varieties (both imported and from foreign affiliates) are well over 50% larger than that stemming from
imported varieties alone.

Introduction

The seminal work of Krugman (1979) highlights that the benefits of trade may stem not only
from lower prices, but also greater product variety. This has generated considerable subsequent literature focused on the role of product variety in international trade and its welfare
effects. A crucial innovation in this literature is Feenstra (1994) which develops a method
for adjusting price indexes to account (discount) for new (disappearing) varieties. Using this
method one can calculate the impact of new imported product varieties on not only economywide prices, but also aggregate welfare. Implementing Feenstra (1994)’s methodology and
using highly-detailed product-level U.S. import data, Broda and Weinstein (2006) estimate
that the substantial rise in new imported varieties over the 1972-2001 period suggests a 1.2
percentage point lower effective aggregate import price per year than that estimated by a
conventional import price index. This translates into a cumulative U.S. welfare gain from
new imported varieties that is equivalent to roughly 2.6% of U.S. GDP.
While understanding the origins and impact of new varieties on international trade patterns and outcomes has been a recent focus in the literature, empirical analysis of these
issues is handicapped by the lack of data on varieties. Empirical studies of the role of product varieties in international trade have exclusively relied on an Armington-type assumption
where each country import source for a given product code represents one unique variety.1
In this paper we explore how severe the measurement bias may be from the previous
product variety assumptions by revisiting the effect of new foreign varieties on prices and
welfare for goods where we can very accurately determine varieties: automobiles. Data on
automobiles are very carefully documented in well-known publications by make and models,
which we use to define unique varieties. We call these data our market data since they
rely on market-based categories of automobile varieties. There are obvious examples of how
different variety classifications will be in the market data than the standard import data used
in previous studies. For instance, whereas the standard import data would classify all makes
and models from Japan as one variety for a given automobile good (say, compact cars), our
market data would show numerous varieties, including Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, Nissan
1

Both Feenstra (1994) and Broda and Weinstein (2006) undertake a brief discussion of pitfalls of this
restrictive documentation of varieties, but ultimately must settle on measuring varieties by import source
due to data limitations.

Sentra, Mitsubishi Lancer, etc. A related issue we will show is that the Harmonized System
(HS) goods codes do not map very well into accepted market-based definitions of automobile
goods. For example, compact cars are classified under numerous HS 10-digit codes and often
lumped with sports cars.
Standard import data may provide biased estimates of price changes and welfare for other
reasons beyond this precision issue with measuring goods and varieties. First, some varieties
that are counted as “new" imported varieties may simply be production of existing varieties
that are offshored to foreign production locations and then imported back to the home
economy. Such varieties should likely not be considered new.2 Second, foreign producers
may introduce new varieties to an economy through new foreign affiliate production that is
obviously not included in import data. Our data provide locations of production for each
variety, as well as ownership of production. Thus, we can accurately measure new imported
varieties, as well as estimate the effect of new varieties not only from imports, but also from
foreign-affiliate production.
Our results first show that the market-based data uncover product variety churning (entering and exiting of varieties) that is orders of magnitude larger market-based data than
what is represented in the standard import data. The Armington assumption “hides" substantial variety change. Applying the methods of Feenstra (1994) and Broda and Weinstein
(2006) to these respective datasets, we find that the estimated impact of new net variety
change on price indexes and, hence, consumer welfare is roughly double in magnitude when
calculated using our market data versus the import data. Our market data allow us to also
examine a number of other issues that one cannot with the import data. First, we show
that the introduction of new varieties and their impact on effective consumer prices has been
greater from import varieties than domestic varieties over our sample. We also have data
on both location and ownership of varieties and therefore can examine the total impact of
variety change from foreign sources (both imports and foreign affiliate activity in the U.S.)
We show that the additional introduction of new varieties by foreign affiliates adds gains
that are around 65% larger than those calculated from only import sources. In summary,
2

For example, a Honda Civic produced at time t in Japan and then at t + 1 in Japan and Mexico will
not be considered a gain of a new variety using market level data, but very well may be considered a variety
gain using import data.

misclassification of goods and varieties by import data, along with the implicit omission
of variety change from foreign affiliate activity, leads to a very large underestimate of net
new variety impact for our sample of the U.S. automobile market. Finally, we show that
our results are virtually identical whether we make calculations using three-year intervals or
annual changes, suggesting that new varieties quickly reach their equilibrium market share
when first introduced.
While our exercise applies specifically to automobiles and cannot be easily applied to other
products in the absence of similarly detailed market data, we note that automobiles are a
significant share of U.S. imports and foreign-affiliate sales in the U.S. Using data from the
Center of International Data, we calculate the fraction of automobile imports by value to be
9.4% (by value) of all U.S. imported manufactured products, and 14.7% of all differentiated
products,3 during the period 1990-2005. In addition, BEA statistics show affiliate sales of
motor vehicles to be 11.6% (by value) of all manufacturing affiliate sales by firms in the U.S.
as of 2002. Thus, the automobile sector comprises a significant share of all differentiated
products delivered to the U.S. from “foreign" sources.
The paper proceeds as follows. The next section describes the detailed market-based
data we have collected for automobiles, comparing it to the import data with HS10 product
classifications for autos that have been used by prior studies. Section 3 briefly reviews the
standard methodology developed by Feenstra (1994) and Broda and Weinstein (2006) to
account for variety change on price indexes before turning to section 4 which implements
this methodology for our two automobile data sets and directly compares the magnitude of
net variety change and welfare. Section 4 also examines further issues, including the effect of
foreign affiliate activity on gains from variety change and the robustness of results to varying
the time interval used to calculate net variety change. Section 5 concludes.

Data

The contribution of our paper stems directly from the use of a more accurate data set of
automobile varieties. A number of prior industrial organization studies have used automobile data to empirically study trade policy effects, price discrimination practices, and even
3

We use the classification proposed by Rauch (1999) to define differentiated products.

technological innovation in this industry using detailed data on specific makes and models
of automobiles.4 Such data for the U.S. market can be gathered from Ward’s Automotive
Yearbook and Automotive News Market Data Book, and include information on model characteristics (height, width, horsepower, etc.), as well as units sold and listed retail prices. For
our purposes, we gathered data from these sources on units sold, listed retail prices, manufacturer, and locations of production for all passenger vehicles sold in the United States from
1990 through 2005.5 With these data, we define “goods" as various categories of automobiles
that are commonly used by industry organizations to classify types of vehicles primarily by
size; namely “subcompact", “compact", “midsize", etc. We then define “varieties" of these
goods as specific makes and models of automobiles. Dodge Neon, Ford Focus, Mazda 3,
Toyota Corolla, and Volkswagen Jetta are examples of varieties of “compact" automobiles
sold during our sample. We will call this data sample our “market data." Table 1 provides a
list of the goods in our market data and counts of varieties for each good.
We contrast this with the type of data used by prior studies to evaluate the effects of
new imported varieties on prices and welfare. These studies rely on what we call “import
data," which for the U.S. are import data collected by U.S. Customs by 10-digit Harmonized
System (HS10) codes. We collect these data from the Center for International Studies at
UC-Davis6 , which provide units of automobiles sold and unit-value prices by country and
HS10 combination. Using import data, “goods" are defined as individual HS10 categories
and “varieties" are, by an Armington-style assumption, each unique country-level import
source. For example, for a given 10-digit HS code, imports from Japan are one unique
variety, imports from Germany are another unique variety, etc. Table 2 provides a list of the
goods for our import data on passenger automobiles, as well as counts of varieties for each
good.
There are a number of important advantages of the market data over the import data.
The primary issue is the definition of varieties and the potential for the import data to
hide variety change. We know that for many import sources of a good, especially ones that

Representative studies in this literature include Goldberg (1995), Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes (1995),

account for significant market share, there are multiple goods that consumers would see as
different varieties. It is clear to see this in our market data. For example, there are many
Japanese automobile producers that ship their unique model of automobile and which all fall
under the same HS10, yet the import data treats these all as one unique variety. This has the
potential to hide significant changes in varieties over time as automobile firms discontinue
or introduce new models.
Indeed, as shown in Table 3, there are significant differences in observed variety change for
automobile goods between the two data sets. Columns 1 and 2 show average annual number
of new and exiting varieties per good across the two data sets, while columns 3 and 4 show
the average annual share of new and exiting varieties in total sales for a given year. The
bottom row for each data set panel provides weighted averages across the goods categorized
in each data set. As one can see, new annual varieties per good are 1.9 on average for the
import data, while significantly higher at 2.5 for the market data set. The average number
of exiting varieties is more similar across the data sets, which means that the market data
reveal much greater net new variety – 1.27 versus 0.26. More importantly for measuring the
importance of net new variety is the share of these new and exiting varieties in total annual
sales. Here, the differences are much more stark. The average share of new varieties is an
order of magnitude higher in the market data than the import data (5.9% versus 0.4%). The
average share of new variety in the market data is 3.0%, while only 0.1% for the import
data. An important factor in these patterns is that the import data show a number of lowvolume imports from countries with no known automobile production. These are presumably
transactions where a final consumer purchased a car in the foreign country and arranged to
have it personally shipped, rather than manufacturer shipments. This inflates the amount
of churning one sees in terms number of new varieties in the import data when just counting
varieties, but then shows little churning in terms of the market share component of these
“new" varieties.
A related advantage of our market data is the ability to determine the ownership of a
variety so that we do not confound “domestic" and “foreign" varieties. The following are
two stark examples to show how the import data can confound this distinction and lead
to serious measurement biases of variety change from foreign sources. Suppose that all

6

imports for a given good are coming from U.S.-owned firms who decided to outsource the
production of existing varieties (formerly produced domestically) to various foreign countries.
The import data would then suggest new variety introduction through imports when, in fact,
U.S. consumers would not be enjoying any new varieties.7 The opposite example is where
foreign firms introduce all new varieties through foreign affiliate production in the U.S.,
not through their imports. In this case, the import data show no new variety change,8 even
though U.S. consumers are enjoying new foreign varieties through foreign-affiliate production
and sales in the U.S. The general message is clear. Import data cannot identify outsourced
production which creates a bias toward finding more import variety change than really exists.
Import data also ignore foreign affiliate production which creates a bias toward finding less
foreign variety change than really exists. How these two effects net out is obviously an
empirical question.
Our market data can directly address this issue because we have automobile production
data by location for each make and model, even when it is produced in more than one
location. Thus, we can examine the price and welfare effects of variety changes from “foreignowned" manufacturers as a question distinct from variety changes from imports only. In
doing so, we will also not confound outsourced production of existing varieties by U.S.
manufacturers as new varieties to U.S. consumers. The automobile sector is an excellent
example to investigate these issues as the value of foreign-affiliate production of automobiles
in the U.S. rivals the value of imported automobiles, as mentioned in the introduction. In
addition, U.S. manufacturers have significantly increased their outsourcing of automobile
models, especially to North American Free Trade Area countries, over our sample period.
Beyond variety definitions, a likely final advantage of the market data over the import
data is the classification of goods. While the HS10 classifications are fairly narrowly defined
over various car sizes, this does not always correspond well with typical classifications made
by automobile industry sources. Table 4 provides a basic concordance between goods in our
7

This assumes that consumers either are not informed about production location or do not differentiate
between automobile models that are identical except for production location. Anecdotally, to “buy American”
implies purchasing either a General Motors, Ford, or Chrysler vehicle. However, these companies outsource
a significant percentage of their production, including entire model lines, most frequently to Canada and
Mexico.
8
The data may even show losses of varieties if production of an entire good is transplanted.

import data and goods in our market data. Virtually all the HS10 goods span multiple goods
in the market data. For example, HS good 8703230046 may contain “compact" automobiles,
as well as “sports" and “sport compact" automobiles.9 This is of concern for the estimation of
elasticities of substitution since one would expect that such elasticities would be significantly
different for “compact" automobiles versus “sport” automobiles. Lumping such dissimilar
automobiles into the same good can then bias these elasticity estimates. There are many
other such examples of dissimilar automobiles falling under the same HS10 classification in
Table 4.
There is one dimension in which the import data good categories may be preferred to those
in our market data. The import data distinguish automobile goods by cylinders and cylinder
volume. Ideally, our market data would have not only sales and prices by make and model,
but also by various packages of models (or “trim" levels) offered. For example, in many models
one can upgrade from a 4-cylinder version of a model to a 6-cylinder version. Our market
data does not provide individual data on sales by these various packages for each variety.
However, we believe that the elasticity of substitution differences across these dimensions
(and resulting bias of pooling them as one variety) are likely less serious than the pooling
across major automobile classifications, such as “compact" versus “sport" automobiles.10
9

Establishing a concordance between the import data and market data is not always straightforward.
We first use the U.S. Customs’ definition of the good then compare the characteristics of the imported
goods with the EPA’s classification of vehicle classes, and concord goods with overlapping characteristics.
Specialty vehicles, such as “sports” and “luxury” autos are the most difficult to concord. For the most part
these vehicles do not follow stringent definitions, and we may conceivably observe their imports in seemingly
unrelated groups.
10
A related issue is measurement error in our price data if actual transaction prices differ from suggested
retail prices that we use as our price variable in the market data. This is assuredly true in many cases,
however we expect the differences to be small. We also have data on the prices of different trim levels for all
models and have investigated using a simple average of these prices. The results differ insignificantly, and
we find using prices of the baseline model most tractable as a simple average likely gives more weight to the
expensive trim levels than is appropriate.

Methodology

3.1.

Nested CES Model

In this section, we briefly review the methodology developed by Feenstra (1994) and expanded upon by Broda and Weinstein (2006), to account for product variety change in price
indexes which can then be translated into welfare changes for an economy.
Specify the upper level of the nested CES utility function as,
κ−1
κ

X

Ut =

κ
! κ−1

,

Xt

with κ > 1,

(1)

X=D,M

where κ represents the elasticity of substitution between Dt , the composite domestic good,
and Mt the composite imported good. We define the composite good in the second tier of
the utility function as,

Xt =

X

γx −1
γx

x
! γ γ−1
x

Xgt

,

with γx > 1 and X = D, M.

(2)

g∈G

The subutility derived from the consumption of the imported or domestic goods from the
set of all goods g ∈ G in time t is denoted by Xgt . The elasticity of substitution across goods
in the set of all imported goods is denoted by γM when X = M . As in the recent works
of Broda and Weinstein (2006) and Imbs and Mejean (2008), the second tier differentiates
across HS10 goods. Alternatively, our market-based data defines goods by the categories
listed in Table 1.
The focus of Feenstra (1994) is to characterize consumers’ choices given they have chosen
a product group. Thus, he limits his analysis to the third tier utility function given by,

Xgt =

X

σg

σg −1
σg

σg
! 1−σ

g

bgvt xgvt

,

with σg > 1 ∀ g ∈ G.

(3)

v∈V

Nonsymmetry in our third tier CES function comes from the taste parameter, bgvt , which
varies across goods and varieties. Consumption of a particular variety of a given good in a

9

particular time period, v ∈ V , is xgvt .
A valid concern one may raise from this representative consumer specification for automobiles is that individual consumers are likely not purchasing continuous quantities of each
variant. Automobiles are an infrequently purchased durable good that lend themselves to
the concept of discrete choice. In fact, the bulk of the industrial organization literature maintains discrete choice individual utility for consumers.11 However, Anderson, dePalma and
Thisse (1992) demonstrate that an economy consisting of consumers who choose a variable
amount of variety v in time period t obtaining indirect utility,
uhgvt


 1
αg
= ln(y) − αg ln bgvt pgvt + hgvt ,

where αg = σg − 1 > 0,

(4)

such that their budget shares allocated to the selected variant is the same for all variants
and prices, is theoretically equivalent to the preceding third tier of our CES representative
consumer model.12 Thus, allowing for a nested discrete choice of similar form, we can
reconcile these seemingly disjoint economies.
3.2.

The resulting unit cost requirement of Equation 3 is readily shown to be,

There is a rich history of work dealing with the estimation of the underlying demand and supply structure
in the automobile market. Goldberg (1995) analyzes the market assuming a discrete choice utility model and
estimating a nested logit. Using consumer level data, she is able to estimate plausible substitution patterns
across available automobile varieties. Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes (1995) develop a random coefficients logit
model that effectively estimates the demand system for autos in the absence of consumer specific data.
12
There is a comparable discussion in Appendix B of Feenstra (2004)’s Advanced International Trade.

10

In order to quantify the bias from neglecting variety change when calculating these equations,
Feenstra (1994) manipulates relative unit cost requirements into an aggregate price index
free of taste parameters, assuming bgvt = bgvt−1 for v ∈ Ig ⊆ (Igt ∩ Igt−1 ), Ig 6= ∅. We define
the exact price index, π, as a function of price, cost minimizing quantity, and variety vectors,
φX (Igt , bgt )
= π X (pgt , pgt−1 , xgt , xgt−1 , Ig )
φX (Igt−1 , bgt−1 )

The bias generated by neglecting new and disappearing varieties on the conventional
price index, P X , is quantified by the λ ratio raised to the power of

σg −1

which we will call

the corrected λ ratio. The λ ratio captures the net gain or loss of varieties by value, as

λgr ≡ P

for r = t − 1, t,

(8)

where v ∈ Ig = (Igt ∩ Igt−1 ) and g ∈ G. In time periods where the expenditure on new varieties in the current period exceeds that of disappearing varieties from the previous period,
the λ ratio scales down the exact price index. Intuitively, consumers gain from an excess
value of new varieties, and lose from an excess of disappearing varieties. The corrected λ
ratio adjusts the period by period net value of new and disappearing varieties by the substi-

11

tutability of these varieties. For large σg , varieties are highly substitutable, and increasing
or decreasing the set available to consumers has little effect on the exact price index. This
is demonstrated clearly through the corrected λ ratio, which approaches 1 regardless of the
net variety change for surviving goods as σg → ∞.
3.2.1.

Aggregate Price Index

Broda and Weinstein (2006) expand upon the exact price index for the subutility function
derived by Feenstra (1994) and show that one can easily aggregate price indexes across many
goods into an aggregate exact import price index which can be written as,
Y

ΠM (pgt , pgt−1 , xgt , xgt−1 , Ig ) =

PgM (Ig )wgt

g∈G



 σwgt

(9)

The weights, wgt , are ideal log-change at the goods level. This second tier price index is dual
for domestic varieties. Thus, the aggregate market price index is,
Π = ΠD

wtD

ΠX

wtM

.

(10)

The exponents are ideal log-change weights at the good origin level. Due to the lack of
domestic data detailing variety change, Broda and Weinstein (2006) cannot calculate an
overall price index as we have defined. They instead focus on the effect of varieties on the
aggregate import price index.13 Thus, for direct comparisons we will focus on the aggregate
import price index using various assumptions about our market level data, since our import
data are deficient in the same way.
13

As a robustness check, Broda and Weinstein (2006) relax the assumption of Krugman (1979), which
specifies that the number of domestic varieties are unassailable from competition with new foreign varieties.
They adopt a model from Helpman and Krugman (1985) which suggests, for their estimates, it is appropriate
to reduce their welfare gains to U.S. consumers from imported varieties by 16%. While we will not be able to
estimate if this is the correct scaling factor to account for displaced domestic varieties, we do expand upon
the understanding of variety change in the domestic sector.

12

3.3.

Estimating σ

To implement price index calculations in Equation 9, we need consistent estimates of the
elasticity of substitution for each variety. Following Feenstra (1994), the underlying demand
in first differences for each variety can be written as,
∆ln(sgvt ) = ϕgt − (σg − 1)∆ln(pgvt ) + gvt ,
#

where,

is a time-good specific random shock driven by the random taste parameter, bt . The variety
specific random shock, gvt = ∆ln(bgvt ), is driven by the random tastes of consumers across
varieties.
We assume producers compete in monopolistically competitive markets for their varieties
such that prices in first differences are,

is ωg ≥ 0.14 Random technology changes in the production of each variety, νgvt manifest

themselves through δgvt = ∆ln 1+ωg . It is vital to our identification strategy that variety
specific shocks to demand and supply be independent, thus we assume E[gvt δgvt ].
Choosing a reference variety, k ∈ V that is present in each period of our sample, we can
difference our demand and supply equations, yielding,
∆k ln(sgvt ) = −(σg − 1)∆k ln(pgvt ) + kgvt

∆k ln(pgvt ) =

This implicitly assumes that the supply elasticity is identical across varieties.

k
kgvt = gvt − gkt . Independence of our errors implies E[kgvt δgvt

the estimating equation

by multiplying the differenced error terms and dividing by σ −1. Endogeneity is apparent, as
the error term in our estimating equation is comprised of the error terms of the regressands.
Feenstra (1994) demonstrates that by taking advantage of the panel nature of the data one
can control for this endogeniety by using variety specific dummies as instruments. This will
produce consistent and efficient estimates of θ1 and θ2 as long as,

In the case where θg < 0, theoretically feasible values for ρg and σg generally cannot be

The use of unit values in place of prices is inherent to import data. Feenstra (1994)
demonstrates that including a constant when estimating Equation 11, solves the problem of
known measurement error bias from using unit values. We will also include a constant when
we estimate using market data, however we expect measurement error to be less severe since
we observe Manfacturer’s Suggested Retail Prices (MSRPs), which are likely closer to actual
transaction prices than unit values.16

Empirical Analysis

We begin our empirical analysis with a comparison of estimated new variety effects using the
traditional import data versus using the market data. As described in the previous section,
this involves first estimating elasticities of substitution separately by good for each data set
following Feenstra (1994) and calculating conventional price indexes and exact price indexes
(which correct for net new variety change) by good. Then, following Broda and Weinstein
(2006), we construct aggregate price index changes for all automobile goods in each data set,
part of which separates out the change in the aggregate price index due to new varieties.
This can then also be easily related to welfare effects due to new varieties. As we will see,
there are significant differences across the data sets in the estimated effects of new varieties.
After these comparisons, we next explore a few issues that one can only address using our
market data sample. First, unlike import data, we have data on domestic varieties and can
compare the patterns of net variety change on prices across domestic and import varieties.
Second, we have information on ownership of varieties in our market data. Therefore, we
can examine the effect of new variety change on U.S. welfare from “foreign-owned” varieties,
rather than simply from imports, some of which may be outsourced domestic-owned varieties.
16
Broda and Weinstein (2006)’s propose an optimal weighting scheme assuming that the measurement
error in unit values is inversely related to the volume of imports. We expect the same relationship to apply
to our market level data for an additional reason. We use the MSRP of the base model as our price measure,
which will be biased down for units sold with expensive options, and biased up in the presence of dealer
discounts. However, there is anecdotal evidence that high sales vehicles tend to have transaction prices closer
to the MSRP of the base model than vehicles with fewer sales.

15

Finally, we examine whether calculated variety change and its effects are sensitive to the time
interval used.
4.1.

Comparison between import and market data

We begin our comparison by first estimating elasticities of substitution for goods for each
data sample and then calculating annual price index changes by good which are comprised
of pure price changes of continuing models and equivalent price changes due to net variety
change. Columns 2 through 5 of Table 4 report relevant estimates and constructed measures
by goods when using our import data.
Column 2 reports our estimates of elasticities of substitution by HS10 goods. There
is substantial heterogeneity in these estimates across goods with a weighted average mean
elasticity of substitution around 11.4 and a median of 7. There are a couple outliers with
large estimated elasticities, but these are for goods with obviously low import activity given
the weighted average elasticity.
We then use these estimates along with our price, quantity, entry, and exit data by variety
to calculate annual changes in the exact price index for each good from 1990 through 2005,
which can be decomposed into the change in the conventional price index multiplied by the
corrected λ ratio that translates net variety change into effective price index changes. We
normalize the price indexes and corrected λ ratios to be 1 for each good in our base year,
1990, and cumulate these changes over our sample.
Columns 3, 4, and 5 of Table 4 show the value of the conventional price index, the
corrected λ term in the final year, and the exact price index for the final year of our sample,
2005, for each good. For example, a value of 2 in the final year means that price index
of the good has doubled over our sample. Also, recall that the corrected λ ratio measures
how much the net variety change scales up or down the exact price index relative to the
conventional price index with values below 1.000 indicating net new variety change.
Overall, there is modest evidence of net variety entry with a weighted-average corrected
λ ratio of 0.977 and a median of 0.998 across goods in Table 4. This represents significantly
less net variety change than that found by Broda and Weinstein (2006), who report a median
value of 0.95 for the same measure across all imported products over the 1990-2001 period.
16

This finding is consistent with the low turnover of automobile varieties we find in the import
data, as discussed earlier.17 As a result of little new net variety change, the differences in
the exact price index over the conventional price index are small on average across products.
While these goods-level comparisons are interesting, the true aggregate picture of net
variety change effects on prices across the automobile sector is obtained aggregating across
goods following Equation 9. These calculations suggest more variety change with an aggregate corrected λ ratio of 0.959 over our 1990-2005 sample of automobile goods. Thus, while
the conventional price index went up 65.7% over our sample of imported automobiles, the
exact price index (controlling for net variety change) only goes up 59.0%. This translates
into a ratio of the exact price index to the conventional price index of 0.960 which compares
to Broda and Weinstein (2006) finding of 0.917 for the same ratio across all imported products in their 1990-2001 sample. These are our baseline measures using the import data and
associate HS10 goods definitions.
We next apply the same methodology to generate analogous results using our market
data and market-based goods definitions. The latter columns of Table 4 show the rough
concordance between the import (HS10) goods and our market goods categories. It is clear
that the concordance is far from a one-to-one mapping and that this will be one source of
differences in estimates across the two samples.
Table 5 provides substitution elasticities, the conventional price index changes, the corrected λ ratio changes, and the exact price index changes over our sample of goods using
our market data.18 We cannot make separate estimates for a couple market goods (Subcompact and Van) using our market data because there is no single variety that survives our
entire sample to serve as a reference variety. Therefore, we combine the data for subcompact
automobiles with compact automobiles, and vans with minivans.
17

HS10 good 8703230036 is an outlier with a very large increase in its exact price index and corrected λ
ratio. This stems from a very large exit of varieties during one of our sampleÕs earlier years. We conjecture
that there may have been an incorrect HS10 classification in this early year, which was right after the U.S.
switched to the HS method of categorizing import goods. Such an artificial change in HS10 classification
would then show up as a large exit in our data. Since this particular HS10 good accounts for a miniscule
share of U.S. automobile imports, it has essentially no impact on our aggregate price index and welfare
calculations.
18
For comparison, we also provide these same measures using our import data estimations and calculations
by concording the import (HS10) goods into our market goods definitions. Namely, we aggregate for each
market good by constructing weighted averages across the relevant import (HS10) goods using ideal weights.

17

From Table 5, estimated elasticities of substitution tend to be slightly higher across
our market-based goods (11.562) than for the import-based goods (11.382).19 These higher
substitution elasticities for the market data sample are even more notable given that marketbased goods categories only number ten, while the import goods (HS10) for automobiles
numbers 28. This suggests that our market-based goods definitions are better at assigning
varieties of the same good than the import-based HS10 good definitions.
The average conventional price change across the goods in Table 5 is about 64% using
the market data. This represents a smaller average price increase than for the import goods
in Table 4 which was about 75%. While this difference is interesting, the interpretation is
not clear since our market prices are at the retail level, while the import prices are border
prices and most likely correspond best to wholesale prices.20
The corrected λ ratio change is significantly lower on average across goods using the
market data than for the import data, suggesting more net variety change. Thus, the market
data suggest more significant net variety gains than the import data, and this means a greater
average difference between the exact and conventional price indexes.
These same results hold when we properly aggregate across our goods using the method
of Broda and Weinstein (2006) and characterized in Equation 9. The first two rows of
Table 6 compare the import and market datasets in their estimates of the relevant measures
of aggregate automobile price and net variety changes. There are large differences. The
primary difference of interest is that the corrected λ ratio across all automobile products
using the market data and goods definitions is 0.922, which represents about 90% more
effective variety change than our benchmark using the import data and goods definitions
(0.959). Assuming the same functional forms as Broda and Weinstein (2006), this means
that the welfare effect from net new variety change is also about twice as large using our
19

We estimate Equation 11 many times, so for the sake of brevity we do not present the individual
coefficient estimates. However, the presence of measurement error follows our previous predictions; estimates
of our constant term suggest measurement error plays a significant role in our import data, but has little
distinguishable effect in our market data.
20
An obvious possibility is that retail profit margins have fallen over our sample. However, there are also
measurement issues in both price terms where systematic changes in those errors over time could account
for the difference. Since this is not the focus of this paper, we do not pursue the issue further.

18

market data as when using our import data.21
Figure 1 provides further information on the differences between the import and market
datasets estimates of net new variety change and its effects on the exact price index, by
showing the annual changes over our sample. Panel A of Figure 1 shows the raw variety
change over time captured by the simple λ ratio, where declines in the ratio indicate net
new variety gains. The market data show substantially more net new variety gains over
time, though these differences are muted when one views the corrected λ ratio shown in
Panel B which accounts for the degree of substitutability between varieties for each good.
As one can see, the latter years of our sample are when the difference in net new variety
changes between the two data sets has become most pronounced. Panels C and D of Figure
1 show the annual changes in the conventional and exact price indexes for automobiles for
each data set. Two clear differences emerge. First, while the market-based price indexes rise
at a fairly consistent rate over the sample, the import-based price indexes show relatively
flat price changes in the beginning and end of the sample with a relatively large annual
price increases from 1994 to 2000. This observation may be attributable to consumption
smoothing practices by retailers that cannot be gleaned from unit values, or a pronounced
effect of measurement error in our import data contributing to the relatively drastic price
swings calculated from these data. Second, and of more interest for this paper, the exact
price index shows much lower price increases relative to the conventional price index (due to
net new variety change) for the market data set than for the import data set.
In summary, there appear to be two opposing biases from the import-based goods
(mis)classifications. First, the Armington assumption on varieties hides significant churning of varieties, which in this case also means it misses a significant amount of net new
variety change and biases one toward finding lower gains from new imported varieties. On
the other hand, to the extent that import goods classifications (HS10) deviate from (true)
21

As Broda and Weinstein (2006) shows, welfare gains from foreign varieties in this model can be calculated
as a compensating variation that is equal to a scaling factor multiplied with the inverse of the conventional
price index. This scaling factor is equal to the inverse of the weighted product of the corrected λ ratios
across goods, raised to the share of foreign varieties in total consumption. When corrected λ ratios and price
indexes are reasonably close to one and the share of foreign varieties in total consumption is greater than
zero, then the compensating variation will roughly correlate directly to how far the corrected λ ratios are
from one. For example, the inverse of 0.922 is 1.085, which is a scaling factor that will roughly lead to twice
the increase from a scaling factor of 1.043 Ð the inverse of 0.959.

19

market-based classifications, elasticities of substitution will be biased downward, which will
bias one toward finding a greater effect of net imported variety change on prices and welfare
in the import data. In our case, we find that the former effect outweighs the latter effect
in significant fashion, creating a bias that underestimates the price and welfare effects of
imported variety change by about half.
4.2.

Comparing Effects Across Domestic and Import Varieties

Past studies of the effects of product variety do not have data on domestic varieties. This
first means that they cannot estimate and compare the impact of net variety change on prices
stemming from domestic sources versus import sources. In contrast, our market data allow
us to easily calculate these measures for domestic varieties, which we do and report in Row
3 of Table 7. As one might expect given the declining market shares of U.S. manufacturers
in the U.S. automobile market, price increases are larger and net variety effects are smaller
for domestic varieties over our sample as compared to what is found for import varieties. We
estimate that the effect of net variety change on prices is twice as large for import varieties
as from domestic varieties. (0.922 is 0.078 points below a scale factor of 1.000, whereas 0.962
is only 0.038 points below 1.000)
4.3.

Accounting for Foreign Affiliate Production

A country most likely cares most about the gains they get from new varieties from foreign
sources, not just those foreign varieties that are imported. As a result, accounting for foreign
affiliate activity is very important in understanding the gains to an economy from foreign
sources. Since the early 1980s foreign automobile manufacturers have located substantial
production in the United States, often introducing new varieties through foreign affiliate
production, not imports. In this way, a focus on import data alone could substantially underestimate the gains to U.S. consumers from foreign varieties. Relatedly, U.S. automobile
manufacturers have outsourced some production to foreign affiliates (most often in NAFTA
partner countries) over the past decades as well. These U.S. varieties may then get erroneously assigned as “foreign" because they are part of U.S. imports, and may lead estimates
of new variety gains from foreign imports to be overestimated.
20

Our market data allows us to easily disentangle foreign from U.S. varieties because we
have information on both the ownership and production location of an automobile variety.
Thus, as an alternative to the import/domestic distinction that is determined by production
location, we split our data by ownership into domestic-owned versus foreign-owned varieties.
Domestic-owned varieties include any varieties produced by a U.S. auto manufacturer, regardless of whether it was produced in the U.S. or outsourced to an affiliate abroad and
imported back into the U.S. Foreign-owned varieties include both those imported into the
U.S. and those produced by foreign affiliates in the U.S.
Table 8 provides estimates of substitution elasticities, price indexes, and corrected lambda
ratios by goods for our samples of domestic and foreign-owned varieties, while the last rows
of Table 6 provide the price indexes and corrected lambda ratio for automobiles when we
appropriately aggregate up over these goods. The results contrast significantly with our
previous estimates separating varieties into “imports" and “domestic". While the estimated
elasticities of substitution are generally in the same range and standard price indexes almost identical, the corrected lambda ratios suggest significantly more net variety change
when separating varieties into domestic- and foreign-owned. The corrected lambda ratio
for foreign-owned is just 0.871, which translates into about a 70% larger impact of net
variety change on the standard price index and, thus, similar differences in welfare gains,
than from imported varieties alone. Interestingly, the estimated effect of net variety change
from domestic-owned varieties is also significantly larger relative to the previously defined
“domestic" (or non-imported) category as well.
In summary, it is clear that defining varieties by ownership, rather than by production
location, has a significant effect on the estimates. To the extent that ownership is the correct
way to classify foreign versus domestic varieties, classification by location (i.e., imports versus non-imports) significantly underestimates the actual welfare gains experienced by U.S.
consumers from foreign varieties of automobiles over our sample. This certainly means that
the bias from not including foreign-owned, domestic-produced varieties as foreign substantially outweighs the bias from including domestic-owned foreign-produced (or outsourced)

21

varieties as foreign.22
4.4.

Robustness of Results to the Time Interval of Calculations

Given annually recorded data, it is natural to make calculations of net variety changes on an
annual basis. However, this implicitly assumes that new varieties achieve their equilibrium
market share within the year of introduction. Alternatively, first-year market shares of new
varieities may be quite different from their ultimate equilibrium market share. For example,
it may take consumers significant time to become fully informed about a new variety. This
may be particularly true in the automobile sector with sophisticated products for which
product reviews and reliability figures take time to gather and observe. If consumers are
cautious in their purchase of new varieties for these reasons, first-year market shares may be
below their eventual equilibrium market share and calculation of the share of net new variety
consumption relative to existing varieties may very well underestimate the true impact of
new varieties on the marketplace.23 There are also reasons why market shares of exiting
varieties may not be true representations of their equilibrium market share. For example, an
automobile manufacturer may simply close down production and sales of an existing variety
in the middle of its final year, leading to a much lower market share than if the variety had
been available for the entire year.
As a simple way to examine the sensitivity of our estimates to these considerations, we
alternatively calculate price indexes and net variety change measures (corrected λ indexes)
using three-year intervals of our data. For example, rather than calculate net new variety
and price index changes for each year from 1990 to 1993, we only calculate the three-year
change over this period. As a result, new varieties that occur in the early part of the threeyear period will have had time to reach their equilibrium market share. Obviously this is
not a perfect solution, as new varieties in the last years of the interval may not have had
time to reach their equilibrium market share, but it will at least give some indication of the
22

We have done separate estimates where we only control for one of these channels of bias at a time and
find that the bias from not taking into net variety change from U.S. outsourcing is very small, whereas the
bias from not taking into account variety change introduced by foreign affiliates is therefore very large.
23
It is certainly possible that first-year market shares could be larger than equilibrium market shares
causing the effects of net variety change to be overestimated. For example, automobile manufacturers may
devote much more advertising expenditures to new varieties distorting their “true" market share.

22

potential bias. This procedure would also miss significant variety change if varieties often
turned over in less than three years. This is not an issue with the automobile data as new
models almost always remain in the market for at least three years.
Table 9 provides calculations when using three-year intervals of our data for the same
scenarios reported in Table 6 using annual intervals to make calculations. Our calculations of
price indexes and net variety changes using our market-based dataset are virtually identical
across the two tables. Figure 2 repeats the exercise undertaken in Figure 1, and yields
qualitatively similar outcomes. This speaks to the robustness of our results and suggests that
first-year new variety market shares and last-year variety market shares are representative of
their equilibrium market shares. We also find in the raw data that the average market share
of new varieties in their first year is not significantly different from their average market
share in subsequent years.

5.

Conclusion

The effects of product variety have been important to international trade economists for
decades, yet measuring varieties remains problematic. This paper revisits important recent
work estimating the impact of variety change from foreign sources on domestic prices and
welfare. Using detailed market-based data on the U.S. automobile sector, we show significant biases resulting from the use of HS product codes to define goods and the Armington
assumption used to assign varieties. Compared to our market-based automobile dataset, HS
codes often lumped quite dissimilar products into the same good classification, which biases
elasticities of substitution downward. On the other hand, the Armington assumption hides
substantial net variety change. On net, our market-based estimates suggest the effect of net
variety change from automobile imports on U.S. welfare for the 1990-2006 period was almost
twice as large as that estimated by the typical trade (HS) data and Armington-defined varieties. Taking into account net variety change by affiliates of foreign firms (something the
import data cannot identify) further increases these welfare effects by about an additional
70%.
While our paper examines the automobile market, we have examined a number of issues
that likely affect the estimation of new variety effects for all (differentiated) products. First,
23

HS10 goods codes may not correspond very well with market-based goods definitions, which
will then likely bias substitution elasticities downward and inflate the estimated impact of
new variety change. Second, the Armington assumption can hide true variety churning (as
measured by market share), but may also artificially inflate churning of varieties measured as
simple counts because import data reflect consumer’s purchases of products foreign country
that is not the location of production. Finally, using only import data ignores the effects
of variety change from foreign affiliate activity that we find to be a significant source of net
new variety change in our data. Recent statistics show foreign affiliate sales in the U.S. to
be roughly similar in size to U.S. imports for not only the motor vehicle sector, but also for
total manufactured goods.
