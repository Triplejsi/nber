Real Balances, the Exchange Rate and
Indexation: Real Variables
in Disinflation

ABSTRACT

The recent appreciation of the dollar is widely believed to have reduced

the output costs of the disinflation. But there remains the question of
whether those early gains have to be repaid when the exchange rate
depreciates.

The first question taken up is the effect of real exchange rate

appreciation on the sacrifice ratio, or output cost, of disinflation. There
is no unambiguous presumption that exchange rate appreciation reduces the

sacrifice ratio. The direct favorable effects of cheaper imports on consumer
prices, on the prices of imported inputs, and on wage demands, may be
outweighed by the unemployment resulting from the reduced demand for exports.
In the second part of the paper I examine the affects of wage indexation

on the sacrifice ratio. Economists have argued that wage indexation speeds
up disinflation; policymakers take the opposite view. The distinction
between ex ante and ex post indexing, defined in the paper, explains these

different views. Ex ante wage indexation speeds up disinflation. With ex
post indexation the real wage automatically rises when the inflation rate

falls. Even so, ex post indexing may speed up disinflation. But there has
to be subsequent downward adjustment of the wage if long—term unemployment is
to be prevented.

REAL BALANCES, THE EXCHANGE RATE, AND INDEXATION: REAL VARIABLES IN
DIS INFLATION

Stanley Fischer*

It has

initiated

long

been known

that

at some stage in a disinflation process

by a discrete reduction in

the growth rate of the money stock, the

rate of inflation must fall by more than the reduction in money growth. The

reason is that the demand forreal balances in the new low inflation steady
state will be higher than in the high inflation equilibrium: the economy
produces real balances by causing the price level to grow more slowly than
the nominal money stock.

In an economy with fully flexible prices, credible government policy and
rational expectations, the start of a disinflation program can be accompanied
by a discrete rise in the money stock that will prevent the price level
jumping and thus inflicting capital gains and losses on nominal creditors and

debtors. However, the credibility problem posed by such a policy is obvious:
to

start a disinflation program with an

increase in the money stock is to

court the suspicion that announcements and actions are not closely related.
The difficulty is compounded by the similarity between a stock increase in
the money stock and a change in its growth rate when data are reported at
discrete intervals.

In

as

an economy where prices are not perfectly

flexible in the

short run,

a result for example of long—term contracts, the increased demand for real

balances that accompanies a disinflation process increases the output costs

of disinflation, or the sacrifice ratio. The sacrifice ratio is the ratio of
the percentage of GNP (at an annual rate) lost to the reduction in the

inflation rate. For instance, the sacrifice ratio for the United States
disinflation, 1980—85, was about 5, meaning that over that five year period
cumulated GNP showed a reduction of 25 percent of one year's output while the
inflation rate fell by about 5 percent, from 10 percent to 5 percent.

This

sacrifice ratio is broadly consistent with the predictions of a model with
price stickiness induced by the existence of long—term labor contracts.1 It
is somewhat below earlier predictions of the output costs of disinflation by
Arthur Okun (1978) but in line with predictions, such as that of Robert
Gordon (1982), that allowed for exchange—rate changes as an extra channel

It is commonly argued that exchange rate appreciation during the United
States disinflation reduced the costs of the disinflation process relative to
costs that would have been incurred had the real exchange rate been held

constant.

The argument is that the rapid response of the exchange rate

brought the inflation rate down rapidly and further put pressure on wages

through enhanced foreign competition. (Rudiger Dornbusch and Fischer
(1984)). Countering this analysis are two points: first, any

exchange rate

appreciation has eventually to be reversed, thus implying that the early
gains on the inflation front are transformed into later losses; second, to
the extent that the exchange rate appreciation increases competitive

pressure, it does so through the creation of unemployment. Willem Buiter and
Marcus Miller (1983) conclude that exchange rate appreciation and

during a disinflation does not affect the sacrifice ratio. 2

In the case of indexation, theoretical analysis shows that indexation
reduces the output costs of disinflation by permitting a more rapid response

ambiguity, and the parameters determining the relative sacrifice ratios in
Section I.

In Section II, I turn to indexation, where the distinction between ex
post arid

ex ante indexation is essential.3 Actual indexation is typicallyex

post, with the current wage adjusting to lagged price levels. As a result,
the real wage tends to rise in a disinflation when wages are indexed. This
increase in the real wage is probably the source of the view that indexation
of wages is an obstacle rather than an aid to disinflation.

I. The Exchange Rate and Disinflation.
Suppose a disinflation program starts with a permanent reduction in the
growth rate of money, not anticipated to that point but fully credible

thereafter. Wages, set in contracts, are not fully flexible. Given wage
stickiness, the disinflation program produces a recession. Over time, wages
adjust and the economy moves towards full employment. The sacrifice ratio is
a measure of the output loss during the transition to lower inflation.
The question in this section is how the openness of the economy affects

the sacrifice ratio. The Dornbusch (1976) overshooting result shows that the
real exchange rate will typically appreciate when the growth rate of the

money stock is reduced. The appreciation occurs because the restrictive
monetary policy raises the domestic nominal interest rate, while foreign
nominal intereast rates are either unchanged or increase less than the

domestic rate. Interest rate equalization then requires the expectation of a
depreciation of the domestic currency. Given long run neutrality of money, a

Brazil, shows the effects of lagged indexation on real wages.

5

depreciation

can be expected oiiy if the real exchange rate is currently

above the equilibrium level.

The model presented in this section includes four channels through which

the exchange rate appreciation affects the sacrifice ratio. First, to the
extent that imported goods are consumer goods, exchange rate appreciation
directly affects the CPI, tending to speed up the price response to the

reduced growth rate of money. To the extent that the CPI is the price level
relevant to the demand for nominal balances, the more rapid response of
prices means a smaller reduction in real balances and less deflationary

pressure. Second, if imported goods are factors of production, the
appreciation reduces costs, and thus has a favorable effect on domestic

supply price, again tending to reduce the sacrifice ratio. Third, if wages
adjust to the expected price level, any quick success in reducing the price
level will have the effect of reducing wages negotiated during the adjustment

period. The more rapidly wages come down, the smaller the output loss.
Fourth, exchange rate appreciation reduces the trade surplus, thereby

reducing demand for domestic goods and output. This effect increases the
sacrifice ratio.

Because the effects do not all operate in the same direction, it is not
-

surprising we do not find an unambiguous answer to the question of how

exchange rate appreciation during a disinflation affects the sacrifice
ratio.

The

model is a modified IS—LM type with inflation and real interest rate

neutrality in the long run. Wages are set in contracts. Perfect capital

effect through b2; the first period appreciation has both a supply side
effect and, through the term b10(1—u) an effect that arises because the
appreciation reduces the CPI and thus wages in period 1.

Understanding of the open economy effects on the sacrifice ratio is
gained by examining the special case in which there are only one period

decreasing in b2. The loss increases in a because the required increase in
real balances to adjust to the new equilibrium is greater the larger is a;
increases in b1 becasue the rise in the real wage has a larger supply effect

The main question we want to investigate is whether the sacrifice ratio

is higher or lower as a result of the real exchange rate appreciation. To
answer this question we have to specify the alternative policy: the
alternative

examined here is to keep the real exchange rate constant at its

steady state level during the disinflation. This is carried out through a

In particular, the direct supply (b2) and demand (d) side effects of the
exchange

rate appreciation can by themselves reverse the relationship between

SRi and SR2. For instance, when b2 = 0, we find SR2 < SRI, but with b1
somewhat larger, the inequality is reversed. With b2 equal to the direct
effect on output supply of a reduction in the cost of imported materials, the
reason

for this result is obvious. Similarly, with d, the direct effect of

the exchange rate on aggregate demand equal to zero, SRi < SR2. The interest

there is a general presumption that the output costs of disinflation

can be made lower when both the exchange rate and price of domestic output

can be adjusted optimally. But whether the appropriate policy is to
appreciate or depreciate the exchange rate depends on the parameters of the
economy.

II. Indexation and Disinflation.
Indexation of wage payments to the price level can take several forms

We distinguish among ex post, ex ante, and lagged ex post indexation. In
discussing these forms

of

indexation, we assume that the price index is

available only with a lag, typically two weeks, after the month to which is

applies. The lag is in practice about a month since the index refers to

prices centered on the middle of the month. We take the lag of the index as
given.

Ex post indexation would make the wage payment for, say, June,

contingent on the actual June price index. The June wages could, for
instance, be paid on the day after the index appears. By that date the price
level that determines the real value of the wage is different from the price

level for which the wage was calculated. Given the price index

lag,

there is

no way of providing a truly certain real wage. In light of this difficulty,
ex post indexation is in practice lagged: the wage paid at the end of June is
adjusted for price level changes up to and including May (providing indexing

16

is monthly). The distinction between ex post and lagged ex post indexing
turns

on whether anyone who worked in June and then leaves the job will later

receive compensation for the June price rise. If they receive compensation,
indexation is genuinely ex post; if not, it is lagged ex post.

Ex ante indexation makes the nominal wage paid in June conditional on
the price level expected at the end of Nay to obtain in June. Such
indexation is important only in long term contracts.

If contracts are for

one period, then the nominal wage will in any event reflect the price
level expected to obtain in the period of work. Ex ante indexation has been

rate. This phenomenon has been analyzed by Modigliani and Padoa-Schioppa
(1978) and Simonsen (1983); in effect it makes for a long—run tradeoff

Because of the difficulty of renegotiating the level, ex post indexation

The general outline of the results can be seen from (21 )—(23). With no
indexation, real adjustment takes two periods.

With complete ex ante

indexing, output is below its full employment level only in period zero. All
contracts thereafter adjust fully for the expected

lower prices, and there is

no further output loss. This is the basis of the argument that indexation
helps speed up disinflation.

However, comparison of the sacrifice ratio between the non—indexed
(x1

= A2 = 0) and ex ante indexed cases requires some care. The impact

Accordingly, with ex ante indexation the impact

demand for money is interest elastic). But the recession is over more
quickly. The question then arises whether the total output cost is

the indexed case. Simple calculations show that the total scrifice ratio

is higher when wages are not indexed than when they are. Ex ante indexation

of wages accordingly reduces the output costs of disinflation by producing a
shorter, sharper recession when the new monetary regime goes into effect.
The comparison between the non—indexed and ex

post indexed systems is

interesting. The long run calculation is clear: if the real wage level is
not adjusted downwards at some stage, the sacrifice ratio for the ex post

Assume for purposes of discussion that a = 0, so that the real interest
rate channel by which expected future deflation affects current output is cut

off. In period zero the nominal wage is given. The extent of the zero'th
period recession is thus the same between the two systems. (If a were not
equal to zero, the first period recession would be bigger in the indexed
system.)

We want now to compare output losses in period one. In both systems
those wages that were negotiated at the end of period zero have reacted to

the disinflation program. In the indexed system, indexed wages are reduced

20

to

a level below those on

non—indexed contracts, as a result of the lower

price level in period zero. The presumtpiOfl is then that output costs in
period one will be lower in the indexed system.

that it

explicitly sets wages on the basis of some agreed upon

negotiations, but they typically remain in the background. It is not
difficult to imagine that negotiators could agree that the forecasts of some
respected institution or economist could serve this purpose.

III. Conclusions.
In this paper I have examined the consequences for the sacrifice ratio

of changes in real variables that may take place during a disinflation. In
addition to the well knowa reduction in the price level relative to trend
arising from an increase in the demand for real balances, we considered the
effects of exchange rate appreciation and wage indexation on the costs of
disinflation.

There appears to be no unambiguous presumption about the effects of

exchange rate appreciation on the output costs of disinflation. But contrary
to other results, we did not find the sacrifice ratio to be invariant to the

path of the exchange rate. The major factors tending to make disinflation
with exchange rate appreciation less costly are a large supply side effect of
the real appreciation, and a large share of imports in the consumer price

index. A large demand side effect through reduced net exports can be
sufficient to make the sacrifice ratio with appreciation larger than that
when the real exchange rate is held constant.

Indexation, ex ante or ex post, speeds up the response of the economy to

disinflation. In the early stages of the disinflation, indexation reduces
the extent of the recession (measured by total loss of output relative to
trend) caused by an unannounced but thenceforth fully credible reduction in

22

the growth rate of the economy. But unless there is a base nominal wage
adjustment, the application of ex post indexing by formula will have a long

term recessionary effect. Such real wage level effects of indexation may
well account for the blame it receives an an impediment to disinflation.
