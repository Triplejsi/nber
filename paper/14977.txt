Toxic Exposure in America: Estimating Fetal and Infant Health Outcomes
Nikhil Agarwal, Chanont Banternghansa, and Linda Bui
NBER Working Paper No. 14977
May 2009
JEL No. I12,Q51
ABSTRACT
We examine the effect of exposure to toxic releases that are tracked by the Toxic Release Inventory
(TRI) on county-level infant and fetal mortality rates in the United States between 1989-2002. We
find significant adverse effects of TRI concentrations on infant mortality rates, but not on fetal mortality
rates. In particular, we estimate that the average county-level decrease in aggregate TRI concentrations
saved in excess of 25,000 infant lives from 1989-2002. Using a value of life of $1.8M - $8.7M, the
savings in lives would be valued at $45B - $217.5B. We also find that the effect of toxic exposure
on health outcomes varies across pollution media: air pollution has a larger impact on health outcomes
than either water or land. And, within air pollution, releases of carcinogens are particularly problematic
for infant health outcomes. We do not, however, find any significant effect on health outcomes from
exposure to two criteria air pollutants – PM10 and ozone.

TOXIC EXPOSURE IN AMERICA :
ESTIMATING FETAL AND INFANT HEALTH OUTCOMES
FROM 14 YEARS OF TRI REPORTING

I.

INTRODUCTION
Over 75,000 different chemical substances, used or manufactured in the United States, are

currently registered with the EPA under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The majority
of those substances are relatively new, having been developed since World War II, and for many,
little is known about their effects on health. Since 1988, the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) has
tracked environmental releases by manufacturing plants in the U.S. of 300 to 600 of these
substances, all of which are either known to be, or suspected of being, hazardous to human health.
It is estimated that, in 2000, more than 100 million pounds of carcinogens, 188 million pounds of
developmental or reproductive toxins, 1 billion pounds of suspected neurological toxins, and 1.7
billion pounds of suspected respiratory toxins were released into the nation’s air, water, and land by
the manufacturing sector alone.1
Toxic substances face cradle-to-grave regulation in the U.S.: Their storage, handling,
transportation, and disposal are all strictly regulated. Yet, for most of these substances, there is no
formal regulation of their releases into the environment. In part, this may be due to a belief that at
low levels of perceived exposure there are no significant health effects.2 And, to a large extent, there
was little public concern over toxic releases until the discovery in 1978 of toxic wastes buried

No comprehensive data set exists for ambient toxic pollutants. Data on ambient toxic concentrations

for only a small number of toxic pollutants have been recorded for a select number of states in 1996, and only
periodically since that time.

beneath a neighborhood in Love Canal, N.Y., and then of a strong correlation between residential
proximity to Love Canal and significantly elevated rates of cancer, neurological disorders, birth
defects, and still births.
Love Canal spurred a number of epidemiological studies into the health effects of toxic
exposure. The bulk of that research consists of cross-sectional studies, usually on adults, and
provides mixed results on the relationship between toxic pollution exposure and health outcomes.
That is similar to what has been observed in the literature on (non-toxic) air pollution and health.
As pointed out by Greenstone and Chay (2003a), the lack of a consensus on the effects of air
pollution on health may be explained by identification problems due to omitted variable bias that
often arise in cross-sectional studies. A second problem is that studies of adult health outcomes may
be flawed by the inability to measure accurately life-time exposure to pollutants. Even abstracting
from mobility issues, using current levels of pollution to proxy for life-time exposure will be
inaccurate if pollution concentration levels have changed dramatically over time, as is true of toxic
pollutants (Needham et al. (2005)).
A third problem is the absence of data on toxic pollution concentrations. At best, toxic
releases are available at the facility level in the manufacturing sector for facilities that are required
to report to the TRI. No data exists, however, for TRI non-reporters within the manufacturing sector
or toxic polluters not required to report to the TRI (including mobile sources). Because the
contributions of pollution from these sources are unobserved and change over time, they cannot be
accounted for in cross-sectional studies. Studies thus far, have not controlled for these time-varying
omitted variables, potentially leading to estimation bias.
In this study, we investigate the health effects of toxic pollution exposure on two particularly
-2-

vulnerable groups: fetuses surviving at least 20 weeks in utero and infants under one year of age.
By doing so, we mostly avoid the problems associated with trying to proxy for life-time exposure
levels. Empirical studies show that mobility rates for pregnant women are low, so that fetal exposure
can reasonably be approximated by pollution concentrations in the mother’s county of residence.
We construct a panel in which we make use of facility level annual toxic release data that we
aggregate to the county-year level and link to files of all births and deaths in the U.S. between 1989
and 2002. We include a large set of covariates to control for potentially confounding effects and
explicitly include proxy variables to control for toxic pollution from both mobile sources and from
facilities in the manufacturing sector that do not report to the TRI – two potentially important
variables which have systematically been omitted from other studies. Our central identification
strategy is based on using exogenous changes in toxic pollution concentrations within state-years to
estimate the causal effect of toxic pollution exposure on infant and fetal health outcomes.
Our findings show that there are significant health consequences to infants from exposure
to toxic releases. We do not, however, find similar outcomes for fetal health, although this may be
due to “harvesting” that occurs during the first 20 weeks of gestation so that fetuses that would
normally survive at least 20 weeks in utero survive less than 20 weeks due to toxic pollution
exposure. We cannot test this hypothesis directly, however, due to poor data quality for fetal deaths
that occur during the first 20 weeks of gestation.
We do find that toxic air releases are significantly more harmful to infant health than other
forms of releases (e.g. water or land) and that carcinogenic air releases have the largest effect on
infant mortality. We estimate that the average county-level decline in toxic air concentrations of
9.5% per year in the manufacturing sector alone led to a total decline in infant mortality of
-3-

approximately 4% in 14 years. The over all reductions by TRI reporters in the manufacturing sector
in various categories of TRI concentrations (by chemical category and by media) during our sample
led to a savings of over 13,800 infant lives. Using a value of a statistical life measure of between
$1.8M and $8.7M, we estimate that the value of the saved lives ranges between $25B and $121B.
Our findings, however, may significantly under estimate the actual effects of toxic releases on infant
mortality, as they do not include the adverse health consequences of releases by TRI non-reporters.
We find evidence to suggest that toxic releases by non-reporting facilities may add significantly to
the impact on infant health outcomes. In contrast to other studies, we do not find any measurable
health effects on infants or fetuses from exposure to ambient concentrations of criteria air pollutants,
specifically, particulate matter (PM10), or ozone (O3).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II we provide a brief summary of
the literature, focusing in particular on epidemiological studies that relate fetal and infant health
outcomes to toxic pollution exposure. We discuss data sources that are used in our study in section
III; descriptive statistics are given in Section IV. Section V describes our methodology, and Section
VI discusses data issues. In Section VII, we present our results. In Section VIII we describe tests
for robustness, and in Section IX we discuss policy implications and provide concluding remarks.
II.

BACKGROUND
It is generally believed that both fetuses and infants are particularly vulnerable to exposure

to toxic pollutants, although the biological mechanisms through which that occurs are not yet well
understood. The National Research Council described four ways in which these two groups may be
especially vulnerable to environmental toxins (Landrigan et al. (2004)). First, children have
disproportionately heavy exposures to many environmental agents because of their size. Relative
-4-

to their body weight, they consume significantly more food and water than adults. Toxins that are
present in the food system or in the water supply may therefore be more harmful to them than to
adults. Second, because the central nervous system is not fully developed until at least 6 months post
birth (Choi (2006)), the blood-brain barrier may be breached by some environmental toxins in a
manner that is less likely later in life. Third, developmental processes are more easily disrupted
during periods of rapid growth and development before and after birth, making exposure to
environmental toxins during these stages particularly harmful. Fourth, because children have longer
life-spans, exposure to environmental toxins at an earlier age, or even in utero, may lead to a higher
probability of developing a chronic disease than if exposure were to occur later in life. Finally, it
should be noted that for infants, both pre- and post-natal exposure to toxic pollution may be
important determinants of their health outcome.
Before addressing the question of fetal or infant health outcomes from exposure to
environmental toxins, it is important to address directly the question of how to measure toxic
exposure. Fetal exposure is a direct consequence of maternal exposure. Most studies assume that
the relevant level of exposure may be captured by the mother’s place of residence at the time of
delivery. That will be true, however, only if the mobility rate of pregnant women is low. Published
studies have estimated residential mobility during pregnancy to range between 12% and 32%, with
one study estimating that, of those that moved, only 5% changed municipality and 4% changed
county during pregnancy. (See Fel et al. (2004), Khoury et al. (1988), Shaw et al. (1992), and Zender
et al. (2001).) In combination, those studies would suggest that, at most, 1.2% of pregnant women
would not have been in residence within their child’s birth-designated county during pregnancy and
at most 1.6% would not have been in residence within their child’s birth-designated municipality.
-5-

Fel et al. (2004) also report that mobility was not correlated with exposure to chemicals or pesticides
in the workplace or at home. They did find, however, that both younger (age < 25) and older (age
>35) women were more mobile, as were unemployed women and those from lower income groups.
The finding of low mobility rates amongst pregnant women also is important as it bounds
the potential confounding effects stemming from pregnant women moving to counties (or
municipalities) with different pollution characteristics based on a Tiebout-type sorting mechanism
(see Banzhaf and Walsh (2008)). This could lead to sample selection bias if, for example, high-risk
pregnant women were sorting into high pollution counties based on some set of personal
characteristics which then might lead to high infant or fetal mortality rates being falsely attributed
to high pollution concentrations.
Several epidemiological studies look at health outcomes for prenatal exposure to toxic
pollutants. A number find a correlation between prenatal exposure and spontaneous abortion,
malformation, and low birth weight (Bove et al. (1995), Carpenter (1994), Landrigan et al. (1999)).
Others, however, find no such correlation (Baker et al. (1988), Croen et al. (1997), Fielder et al.
(2000), Kharrazi (1997), Sonsiak (1994)). More recent work suggests that the health effects may be
tied only to particular categories of toxic pollutants. For example, Meuller et al. (2007) look at the
relationship between fetal deaths and maternal proximity to hazardous waste sites, but finds
statistically significant results only for proximity to waste sites associated with pesticides.
Infant health outcomes may be affected both by exposure that occurs in utero and after birth.
It is well documented that infants are at particular risk for exposure to heavy metals, such as lead and
methyl mercury (Landrigan et al. (2004 )). Choi et al. (2004) find that there is a higher risk of
childhood brain cancer when mothers live close to a TRI emitting facility. Making use of TRI data,
-6-

Marshall et. al. (1997) find a slight increase in certain birth defects due to exposure to toxic releases.
Because of similarities in terms both of econometric issues and issues of causality, it is useful
to look also at the literature on (non-toxic) air pollution and health. Greenstone and Chay (2003a),
for example, examine the effects of total suspended particulates (TSPs) on infant mortality rates.
They use the changes in TSP pollution concentrations generated by the 1981-82 recession as a
“quasi-experiment” to identify changes in infant mortality at the county level in the U.S. Their
underlying assumption is that the recession-induced variation in county-level TSP concentrations
is exogenous to infant mortality rates. They compare cross-sectional results for each year between
1978 and 1984 to a panel-data, fixed-effects model (in first-differences) and show that the traditional
cross-sectional approach can produce misleading results due to unobserved, omitted confounders.
Using an approach that mitigates many of these identification problems, Greenstone and Chay find
that a 1 :g/m3 reduction in TSP concentration results in approximately 4to 8 fewer infant deaths per
100,000 live births at the county level. Over the 1980-82 recession, they estimate that the reduction
in TSPs led to approximately 2,500 fewer infant deaths.
Currie and Neidell (2005) also examine the relationship between ambient air pollution
concentrations and infant and fetal mortality. They focus on California during the 1990s and
examine 3 different criteria air pollutants: carbon monoxide, particulate matter, and ozone. Unlike
most other air pollution studies, Currie and Neidell allow for correlations across pollutants in their
effect on infant mortality. Taking individual data that they aggregate up to the zip code--month
level, they estimate an approximate linear hazard model and find a significant effect of carbon
monoxide on infant mortality (although not on fetal mortality) and estimate that the significant
reduction in carbon monoxide concentrations in California saved approximately 1,000 infant lives
-7-

over the 1990s.
Taking a cue from both Greenstone and Chay (2003a, 2003b) and Currie and Neidell (2005),
we make use of the reduction in TRI releases across location and time to identify the effects of toxic
pollution on health. Our maintained assumption is that both the reductions in toxic releases and the
distribution and characteristics of industries across counties over time are exogenous to determinants
of infant and fetal health outcomes. We base our assumptions on the following evidence: (1) Large
polluting companies of TRI “priority” substances were contacted in early 1991and 1992 and were
invited to participate in a “voluntary” abatement program called the TRI 33/50. Participants of this
program agreed to reduce their releases by 33% from their 1988 baselines by 1992 and 50% by 1995.
In total, over 1000 companies (and their facilities) participated in this program and all target
reductions were met. (2) The deadlines to meet the requirements set out under the Montreal
Protocol, an international agreement that required the phase-out of several ozone-depleting chemicals
that are listed substances under the TRI occurred in 1994 and 1996 (and later in 2003, and 2005).
These phase-out deadlines were also met. (3) Over 26 states adopted Toxic Use Reduction
Programs to encourage the reduction of toxic substance use in the production process. These
programs primarily provided educational outreach to polluters to help them abate, although some
states instituted (numeric) state-wide reduction goals (some with target compliance dates, as well
as penalties associated with non-compliance). (4) Nationwide recessions occurred in 1990-1991 and
in 2001. The contraction of manufacturing during this time period also led to a reduction in TRI
releases across the country. For many industries, for example the electronic industry, the recession
in 2001 was exacerbated by a build up in inventory during the 1990 boom years, which further
suppressed production. And (5) because reductions in toxic releases are “voluntary” in nature, only
-8-

facilities and industries that can abate at low cost will do so. We observe large variations across
industry in their reported abatement activities. For example, during our sample period, petroleum
refineries reduced their releases by 74% whereas the food industry increased their releases by more
than 174%. We also observe that larger facilities report larger reductions in abatement than smaller
facilities.

Taking these five points together, we believe that there is ample evidence that the

majority of the toxic reductions may be taken as exogenous to factors that determine infant and fetal
health outcomes.
To control for other potential confounding effects, we include a rich vector of parental
characteristics, prenatal care information, and medicaid and other income transfers. We also allow
for the possibility that other types of pollution exposure may affect health outcomes. In particular,
we include measures for particulate matter and ozone concentration. Those two criteria air pollutants
are also used as a proxy for toxic air pollution concentrations that are derived from mobile sources
of pollution, as they are highly correlated with fuel combustion. And, unlike other studies that have
made use of TRI data, we construct two unique proxy variables that allow us to control for the effects
of time-varying toxic releases from non-reporting TRI facilities.
III.

DATA
We combine data from various sources to construct a comprehensive set of measures at the

county level for the period 1989 to 2002. (We restrict ourselves to these years because of changes
in the data format for our primary variables post 2002 that could lead to inconsistencies in the
measurement of our variables.) Data on pregnancy outcomes are from the National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS). Data on toxic emissions are from the Toxic Release Inventory,
maintained by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Those two data sets are
-9-

supplemented by county-level data on income, job composition, transfer payments from health and
unemployment benefit programs, and population, all from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.
Data on land and water area are taken from the U.S. Census 2000 Gazetteer Files. In this section we
provide a detailed description of the primary data used in this study.
Infant and Fetal Health Outcomes Data
Our dependent variables and many important control variables are taken from infant3 birth
and death records and fetal death records provided by NCHS. These records are constructed from
a census of death and birth certificates, as required by law in all states. The NCHS, in cooperation
with the states and territories of the U.S., has promulgated a uniform instrument with which to
collect information on each fetal death. (Our estimate of pregnancies comes from adding live births
and reported fetal deaths in a given year; as such it does not include terminated pregnancies.)
Infant Data: Birth certificates contain information about parentage, in addition to
limited details about the medical history of the mother and the specific pregnancy. The variables that
we use as controls include the reported age, education, marital status, and race of the parents;
reported tobacco and alcohol consumption; and the level of pre-natal care as indicated by the number
of prenatal visits to a doctor.
We use death certificates to identify the cause of death as coded using the International
Classification of Diseases. We remove infant deaths caused by external factors (such as physical
injury) from our measures, as they are not related to the exposure of toxic releases. We refer to the
retained observations as “internal” infant deaths.
Fetal Data: Information in the fetal death files includes some of the same information
3

An infant is defined as being an individual under one year of age.

-10-

that is available in birth certificates, such as the reported age, education, marital status, and race of
the parents; tobacco and alcohol consumption; and the level of prenatal care. The period of gestation
is also included. Deaths of fetuses at less than 20 weeks are not well reported in the data set. Birth
certificates and fetal death records also report the county of the mother’s residence coded using the
Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS).
Using the individual-level data described above, we compute county-level statistics based
on the county of residence of the mother, for infant death rates due to internal causes and death rates
for fetuses with a period of gestation of more than 20 weeks. Our control variables are likewise
aggregated to the county level, by computing averages of measures such as maternal and paternal
age, maternal years of education, and the number of prenatal visits. We also compute for each
county and year the fraction of pregnant mothers in each of the following categories: white, AfricanAmerican, mothers that smoke tobacco, mothers that consume alcohol, and mothers that are married.
The health data set, thus aggregated to the county-year level by the residence of the mother, is then
merged with data on toxic releases.
Toxic Release Data
Data on toxic releases are taken from the Toxic Release Inventory. The TRI was introduced
in 1986 under the Emergency Planning, Community Right To Know Act (EPCRA) and requires that
all manufacturing plants with ten or more full-time employees that either use or manufacture more
than a threshold level of a listed substance report their toxic releases to a publicly maintained
database. The first year of reporting was 1987. At that time, there were approximately 300 TRI listed
substances. In 1995, this list was expanded to include 286 new substances. Today (2008), the TRI
covers 581 individually listed chemicals, 27 chemical categories, and 3 delimited categories
-11-

containing another 58 chemicals. Reporting thresholds have remained at 10,000 lbs (annually) for
most chemicals, with the exception of 4 persistent, bio-accumulative, toxic chemical (PBT)
categories, containing 16 PBT chemicals. (See www.epa.gov/tri/lawsandregs/pbt/pbtrule.htm.)
Because of changing thresholds and both the addition and deletion of reporting chemicals over time,
we restrict our analysis to the stable base set of 1988 chemicals that are not affected by subsequent
changes in reporting thresholds.4
TRI data are reported at the facility level. Separate reports are filed for each TRI substance
for which the facility meets the reporting requirements. Information is provided as to whether the
toxic pollutant is released on-site or transferred off-site. We restrict our reported analysis to on-site
releases, although all results are robust to the inclusion of off-site releases. Data are broken down
by medium (air, water, land, etc.), and information is provided as to whether the substance is a
known carcinogen. Using TRI-provided information on chemical CAS number, we further classify
TRI chemicals as a developmental or reproductive toxin if it is listed as such in the State of
California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act. The TRI data set also provides
information on whether a chemical is simultaneously regulated under the Clean Air Act.
With these data we construct, for each county-year observation, the total pounds of TRI
releases net of any Clean Air Act releases by air, water, and “land” (where land is the residual
category = aggregate releases - air releases - water releases); broken down by carcinogenic, and

4

We calculate the correlations between the balanced panel of 1988 chemicals and the newer

chemicals that were added to TRI reporting requirements and find that they are low – below 23%. This
suggests that bias from not including those chemicals in our analysis should be reasonably small.

-12-

developmental and/or reproductive toxic emissions.5 (We exclude CAA chemicals from our
measures of TRI concentrations to avoid any possibility of “double counting” because we include
measures of criteria air pollution concentrations in our models of health outcomes.) Using geographic data from the Census 2000 Gazetteer Files, we construct a crude measure of “concentration”
by dividing total pounds of releases by land area.
Criteria Air Pollution Data
When examining the relationship between TRI releases and health, it is important to control
for the effect that other pollutants may have on health outcomes. We therefore supplement the TRI
pollution data with data on concentrations of criteria air pollutants, as provided by EPA’s National
Air Data Group. Those data were extracted from recordings taken from pollution monitors located
in various counties across the nation. The data set provides means, variances, medians, and higher
percentiles of concentrations observed by monitoring stations in a given day of a year. Of these
values, we make use of the daily average concentration and the 95th percentile concentration. In
some counties, there are multiple monitoring stations. In those cases, we use the simple average
across all monitoring stations for the daily average concentration and for the 95th percentile
concentration.

Most counties, however, do not have any monitoring stations that measure all

categories of criteria air pollution concentrations. We choose to concentrate on particulate matter
(PM10) and ozone (O3) because these pollutants had the least number of missing county-level
observations and because a number of studies have shown a potential link between their ambient
concentration levels and adverse health outcomes for both infants and the unborn. An additional
benefit of including PM10 and O3 in our study is that they are thought to be highly correlated with

Some chemicals are classified as both carcinogenic and developmental and/or reproductive toxins.

mobile source emissions of pollution and are therefore used as controls for toxic pollution
concentrations from mobile sources of pollution.
Other Data Sources
Several county-level controls are also used in our study. Data on per capita income,
Medicaid transfers, food stamp participation, and other government supplemental income transfers
are taken from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The fraction of the labor force employed
in the manufacturing sector as well as county-level unemployment rates also come from the BEA.
The number of facilities by 2-digit SIC code are taken from the County-level Business Patterns data
collected by the U.S. Census Bureau.
IV.

BIRTHS, DEATHS, AND TOXIC RELEASES: 1989-2002
The TRI-internal infant death and fetal death data set consists of 43,124 county-year

observations; when linked with County Business Pattern data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau,
we have 42,617 county-year observations; and when we further include county-level demographic
data, we have 41,908 county-year observations. The last of these data sets is referred to as the “full”
sample, which we describe, below.
Between 1989 and 2002, there were over 54.3 million live births in the United States, with
410,615 internal infant deaths and 381,988 fetal deaths (post 20 weeks) recorded. More than 34.2
billion lbs of toxic pollutants were released into the environment by TRI reporters from the
manufacturing sector, 28.8 billion lbs of which were released on-site. Of the on-site releases, 3.12
billion pounds were carcinogens (2.68 billion lbs in the form of air releases) and 3.27 billion lbs of
which were developmental or reproductive toxins (3.24 billion lbs in the form of air releases).
Of the 41,908 county-year observations for which we have TRI, birth and infant/fetal death
-14-

information, and county-level demographic information, only 10.8%, or 4,524 county-years, also
have air monitoring stations that collect PM10 and ozone concentrations. Over the period of study,
this sample covers 53% of the country’s over-all population, 57.6% of live births, 41.5% of
aggregate TRI releases, and 39.6% of TRI on-site releases, and is the basis for our regression
analysis. Select summary statistics for this data set (the “restricted” sample) are presented in Tables
1 through 3, and described below. The restricted sample consists of an un-balanced panel with
between 273 and 376 counties, ranging in population from 2,294 to 9,800,000.
In real terms, per capita income is increasing in our restricted sample, although not
monotonically. Medicaid transfers (as well as other income transfers) are also increasing over our
sample period. Not surprisingly, the percentage of jobs in the manufacturing sector steadily
declined, from 16.48% to 9.51%. That may be important for our study, as TRI releases come
predominantly from manufacturing, and workers in that sector may experience additional exposure
to toxic chemicals in their workplace, which in turn may affect infant and fetal health outcomes.
With respect to parental characteristics of possible relevance to health outcomes, we note that
average maternal age at birth increased slightly over time. If that is due to a reduction in teenage
pregnancy, known to be associated with poorer health outcomes for both the fetuses and infants, this
might lead to lower infant and fetal mortality rates. If, on the other hand, it is due to women bearing
children later in life, it might be detrimental to fetal and infant mortality. Maternal behavioral
characteristics, however, clearly point to potential improvements in fetal and infant health. The
consumption of tobacco during pregnancy fell dramatically over the 14 years covered by our study,
from a high of 17.55% to a low of 8.11%. The consumption of alcohol during pregnancy likewise
fell between 1990 and 1999, but rose dramatically thereafter. One possible explanation for that
-15-

reversal is the appearance of studies suggesting that there were positive (or no) health effects, for
mother or fetus, from small amounts of alcohol consumption during pregnancy.6
Nationwide, mean county-level infant deaths from internal causes declined almost
monotonically between 1989 and 2002 from 948.9 to 660.9 deaths per 100,000 live births, or by
nearly 30%. A smaller decline (9%) was observed for fetal deaths (post 20 weeks gestation). In the
restricted sample, we observe a similar decline for infant deaths from internal causes (approximately
29%), but a much larger decline in fetal deaths (20%) than the national trend. We note also that
internal infant mortality rates vary significantly across TRI concentrations (net of Clean Air Act
chemicals) by quartile, being significantly higher for the dirtiest TRI counties. The same pattern
holds for fetal mortality rates. (See Figures 1 through 3.)
In 1989, average county-level on-site toxic concentrations (weighted by live-births) were
approximately 3,159 lbs/sq. mile; toxic air releases (net of CAA chemicals) made up over 63% and
toxic water releases some 5.7% of all on-site releases. By 2002, average county-level on-site toxic
concentrations had declined 47% to 1,680 lbs/sq. mile and the contribution to releases by air and
water fell to 44% and 2%, respectively.

During this same period, both carcinogenic and

developmental/reproductive toxin concentrations fell, suggesting that the most toxic of the TRI
releases participated in the observed over-all decline. It should be noted, however, that the declines
in releases (and subsequently, concentrations) have been far from monotonic. Although the annual
average change in toxic concentrations over the sample period is almost -4%, the standard deviation

is over 13% with changes in county-level, average annual TRI concentrations ranging between -31%
and +15%. (See Figures 4 through 6.)
In contrast to TRI concentrations, ambient air concentrations for ozone and particulate matter
are reasonably stable throughout our sample. Average county-level ozone concentrations (ppm) rose
from 0.0256 to 0.0282, whereas PM10 concentrations (:g/m3) fell from 36.55 to 25.48. The variance
in concentrations is small, across time, across county, and within county.

METHODOLOGY
The approach widely used to estimate the effects of non-toxic pollution on health outcomes

(infant and fetal mortality) assumes that the effects of the covariates on health is linear and additive.7
There is evidence, however, that suggests significant non-linearities in the effects of toxic pollution
on infant health, possibly due to threshold effects. Because mis-specification of the functional form
can lead to biased estimates, we have a more flexible specification to allow for a non-linear doseresponse function by including quadratic terms of the toxic pollution covariates in our model.8
We assume, then, that the true relationship between infant mortality and toxic pollution can
be modeled as
(1)
(2)
where i indexes county and t indexes year. Xit is our independent variable of interest, the
concentrations of toxic releases; Zit are a set of covariates that capture aggregate parental

characteristics; and Wit are controls for other county-level characteristics.
Because geographic information in our infant birth/death data is at the county level, we
aggregate all data to the county-year level. An ordinary least squares estimator would equally weight
large and small counties. To more accurately measure the effect of pollution on infant mortality, we
use an estimation strategy that weights each county-observation by the number of live births in that
county-year. For weighted least squares (weighted by live births) to consistently estimate $1 and $2,
,it must be orthogonal to Xit. If there are county-fixed unobservables "i, time-fixed unobservables
(t, and county-time varying unobservables 8it that are correlated with Xit (and Yit), ,it will no longer
be orthogonal to Xit. Including county-time interaction terms would be one method that would
correct all such possible biases if the data structure allowed for it. That approach is foreclosed,
however, by a constraint on the available degrees of freedom because the covariates in our model
are aggregated to the county-year level.
While it is therefore not possible to correct for all sources of bias from county-time varying
unobservables, it is straightforward to correct for biases stemming from only county-fixed or timefixed unobservables. One approach would be to use a model with county-demeaned variables to
remove the county-level unobserved fixed effects, and to include dummy variables to correct for bias
from the time-fixed unobservables. To do so, we take the difference between county-level
observations at period t and mean county-level observation across all years to obtain

where

etc.
For consistent estimation of (3) by WLS after including time-fixed effects to control for

(

), we need to assume that (

) is orthogonal to (

) conditional on time fixed-

effects. This implies that the annual deviation in levels of pollution concentration by manufacturing
plants in a particular county is not correlated with annual deviations in other (uncontrolled) factors
that are correlated with infant health in that county. Since we control for county-fixed and timefixed unobservables, these factors are exclusively those with significant variation across time within
each county. Presumably, many of those factors are constant across all counties within a single stateyear. For example, changes in policy within a state in a given year may affect both infant health and
toxic pollution. So, to control for effects that are neither fixed within a county or across time, but
are fixed within state-time groups, we include state-time variables in our demeaned model.
If the size of the residual county-time varying unobservables that are correlated with toxic
pollution is not large and the within state-time variation is large enough, we can consistently estimate
$1 and $2 using WLS. Table 2 presents the within state-time variation of the key variables in the
model. The within state-time standard deviation of the demeaned variable of our county-level and
parental demographic characteristics is less than a fifth of the overall standard deviation in most
cases. We conclude that a model that accounts for county-fixed and state-time interaction effects
will adequately control for unobservables that may induce bias in the WLS estimator. While the
within state-time variation is not high for county characteristics, the within state-time standard
deviation of each of our measures (in terms of county-demeaned variables) of toxic pollution
concentration and the infant health statistic is at least a third of the overall standard deviation. This

-19-

gives us confidence that correcting for state-time interaction effects, in addition to county-fixed and
time-fixed effects, has not purged our model of the variation that would be necessary for
identification. As described more fully in Section II, we believe that the source of within state-time
variation in the demeaned toxic pollution concentration stems from the distribution of manufacturing
industries in the counties of a state.9 Over time within a county, there is variation in the level of
pollution abatement by different industries, induced by TRI reporting and other factors exogenous
to health outcomes. This variation can be used to identify the effect of the concentration of toxic
pollution of infant and fetal health.

We therefore estimate the following model in which

observations are weighted by live births:
(5)
where s indexes the state of county i. >st are state-time indicators and <it is an orthogonal error term.
For consistent estimation of (5), we assume that

and

.

Intuitively, this says that the time demeaned distribution of toxic pollution from the manufacturing
sector across counties within a given state is exogenous to variations in county characteristics that
may affect infant (fetal) mortality rates that are not captured in >st, Zit, or Wit. Since we control for
state-time interaction effects, we need only assume that the location choice of different types of
manufacturing industries (heavy polluters or otherwise) within a state is random with respect to other
factors that might affect pre-natal or peri-natal health. This assumption will also be reasonable as
9

We also test this directly by examining whether industry level dummies have any explanatory

power to predict variations in toxic releases at the county-level (where state-year fixed effects are included).
The resulting F-statistic is sufficiently large to allow for rejection of the null hypothesis at the 1%
significance level.

-20-

long as the variation in (

) within a state is low for each year in our sample. By controlling

for state-time interaction effects, we believe we have eliminated most sources of potential bias in our
model.
An examination of the correlation between the TRI release statistics and covariates, Zit and
Wit indicate that the correlation between the levels of TRI pollution and most parental and county
characteristics is low, as well as with the criteria air pollution concentrations (see Table 3, panel II).
Only for Medicaid benefits and mother’s race (black) do we observe a correlation greater than 15%
with pollution concentrations. (For the sample of large counties > 250,000 in population, post 1996,
we also find high correlations between pollution measures and demographic characteristics like
racial composition and percentage of children born in wedlock. This, in and of itself, may be
important for issues relating to environmental justice and public policy.) In any event, the
correlation measures for those variables that we can explicitly control for suggests that bias due to
8it should not be large. A Hausman test for exogeneity also may be used to test this hypothesis
directly (this is discussed in Section VII).
Finally, we are concerned that errors both across time within a county and across counties
within a state might not be independent. If TRI releases are serially correlated within a county or
state-wide effects cause dependence in releases between two counties within a state, assuming that
<it are distributed i.i.d. might yield inconsistent standard errors and invalidate any statistical
inference. To avoid these problems, we cluster our standard errors within state-groups so that when
computing standard errors, if i and j are two counties in the same state, we allow for Corr(<it, <jt) 0.
This error specification may also help to correct for spacial correlation that exists due to spillover
effects across county borders within states, but not across states.

VI:

DATA ISSUES
Toxic Pollution Concentrations
The estimating model described in (5) assumes that measurements of toxic pollution

concentrations are available at the county-level. Virtually no data exist, however, on toxic pollution
concentrations. So, in contrast with studies on criteria air pollutants where monitoring stations can
provide concentration data, we must estimate toxic pollution concentrations.
It is widely believed that the two principle sources of toxic pollution are manufacturing
activities, and mobile sources. That is our maintained assumption.10 Even with that assumption,
however, we can observe toxic releases only from TRI reporting facilities within the manufacturing
sector and not from non-reporting TRI facilities or from mobile sources of toxic pollution. Not
accounting for such factors obviously leads to a serious risk of omitted variable bias in our model.
The problem, therefore, is how to control for these unobserved contributors to toxic releases.
Toxic releases from mobile sources of pollution are generated predominantly by internal
combustion and therefore are correlated with non-toxic pollutants that are simultaneously generated
in the same process. Here, then, we proxy for their releases through observed concentrations of
PM10 and ozone, of which internal combustion is know to be a major source.
Controlling for toxic releases from non-TRI reporting sources is more complicated. Our

10

TRI reporting requirements after 1998 were expanded to include a small number of non-

manufacturing industries, including electric utilities and mining. We do not include these industries in our
analysis; however, for the years in which we have TRI data for them, we calculate the correlations between
releases from the “new” industries and releases from the “original” industries. The correlation between the
new and original industries is under 14% for all TRI release types (by media and category), so we do not
expect a significant bias from omitting these industries.

-22-

strategy is to construct two proxy variables for each county-year. Our first proxy variable captures
the percentage of non-reporting TRI facilities in the manufacturing sector. The second takes into
account both the number of non-reporting facilities by 2-digit SIC code in manufacturing and the
relative dirtiness of those industries based on national annual TRI releases by reporting facilities.
The construction of these variables is described more fully below.
Toxic Concentrations from TRI Reporting Facilities:

County-level toxic pollution

concentrations that originate from the manufacturing sector are measured as pounds of toxic releases
per square mile.11 Toxic release data are available for facilities in a specified range of manufacturing
SIC codes that have at least ten full-time employees and that either use or manufacture more than
a threshold level of a specified toxic pollutant under the TRI. For our analysis, we restrict ourselves
to the 1988 balanced panel of both toxic pollutants and industries covered by the TRI.
As noted in the data section, the TRI provides information on whether the toxic releases are
released “on-site” or are transported “off-site.” Aggregate releases are defined as being the sum of
both on-site and off-site releases that are produced at the facility. For this paper, we report the
results only for on-site releases, although our results are robust to using aggregate releases as well.
Toxic Concentration Proxies for Non-TRI Reporters: A facility in a “designated” SIC code
may be a non-reporter for several reasons: they may not have had 10 or more full-time employees,

11

An alternative approach might be to look at the exact distance between a mother’s residence

(address) and a toxic plant to obtain a possibly better measure of exposure. This approach has been taken
by some epidemiologists (see, for example, Choi (2004)) and is currently being explored by Janet Currie in
preliminary, unpublished work that focuses on infant health, environmental justice, and toxic pollution
exposure in New Jersey, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Texas (IHEA Conference, Summer 2007, Copenhagen).
The nature of our data precludes us from taking this approach.

-23-

they may have fallen below the reporting threshold, or they may simply have failed to report.
Although it is generally thought that non-reporters are small polluters, there is little evidence as to
what over-all contribution they make to toxic pollution releases within a county or to what extent
they may be correlated with reported releases. To address the issue of potential omitted variable bias
in our estimation, we make use of the County Business Pattern data collected from the U.S. Census
Bureau to construct two separate variables that we use to control for non-reporter toxic release
concentrations.12
For the first variable, we determine the total number of facilities in operation by county in
the manufacturing sector (SIC 20-39). From the TRI data we calculate the number of TRI reporting
facilities by county and 2-digit SIC code. From these we construct a variable that is the percentage
of non-reporting facilities within a county. Within the regression sample of 4524 county-year
observations, 204 county-years had no reporting facilities, and 22 county-years had no non-reporting
facilities. Over all, the average percentage of non-reporters within a county year is 92.8%, with a
standard deviation of 8.1%. Counties with higher percentages of non-reporting facilities (above the
mean value) tend to be counties with much lower TRI concentrations, lower percentages of
employment in the manufacturing sector, and higher per capita income levels. These counties also
have lower rates of fetal (> 20 weeks gestation) and infant mortality – both internal and external.
Because releases vary greatly both across industries and over time, and not just by the number
of facilities, we construct a second variable that controls for the relative “dirtiness” of non-reporting
facilities, depending on the distribution of non-reporters within a county over time. That is done by

12

We thank Wayne Gray for suggesting the use of this data set, which allowed us to construct these

proxy variables.

-24-

constructing an annual national index based on aggregating TRI data by 2-digit SIC codes and
calculating average facility-level TRI releases. For each county and year, we then take the number
of non-reporting facilities in each 2-digit SIC code and multiply it by a “dirtiness” index – namely
the national “dirtiness” rank of that 2-digit SIC code. That value is summed over all industries in
the county in each year to construct our second control variable. This variable assumes that the rank
distribution of TRI releases by non-reporting facilities across industries and time is the same as for
reporting facilities. To obtain a “pseudo-concentration” value, we divide the control variable by land
area. This variable will be largest for counties with many non-reporting facilities in the dirtiest
industries and smallest for counties with few non-reporting facilities in the cleanest industries.
As a check on the validity of our two variables to proxy for the contribution of toxic releases
from non-reporting facilities, we construct the same two variables for reporting facilities. We then
regress aggregate, actual county-level TRI concentrations on the newly constructed control variables
and all other exogenous variables in our health-outcome model (the first-stage regression). Given
the very large F-statistic from the first-stage regression, we conclude that they are strong instruments.
This suggests that our proxy variables may be sound controls for toxic pollution contributions from
unobserved non-reporters.
Measurement Error
There are two types of measurement error to consider. The first is classical measurement
error that arises because we do not have “true” toxic pollution exposure or concentration measures.
Instead, we make use of toxic pollution releases that we modify into a “concentration” measure by
normalizing pounds of releases by county land area. This leads to attenuation bias in our estimates.
The second type of measurement error is non-classical measurement error that arises from
-25-

using survey data. Evidence in the labor literature shows that errors in survey data may be
substantial and problematic when used for estimation purposes, and the direction of any bias may
be difficult to predict. Although this type of measurement error almost surely exists in TRI data, we
assume that TRI survey respondents are providing TRI release estimations that are based on their
best available information and, more importantly, are making those estimations independent of
county-level infant (or fetal) mortality rates. Under these conditions, the non-classical measurement
error in TRI releases may be described as “optimal prediction errors” in the regressor, and no
additional bias should be introduced into the estimators from this source of measurement error (see
Hyslop and Imbens (2000)).
VII.

ESTIMATION RESULTS
Tables 4 to 6 summarize the effects of TRI concentrations on infant mortality and fetal

mortality (> 20 weeks) rates per 100,000 live births or 100,000 unterminated pregnancies from
estimating the county-level fixed-effects model described in (5). Infant mortality regressions are
weighted by total number of live births in each county and year, whereas fetal mortality regressions
are weighted by the total number of unterminated pregnancies. We report standard errors that are
robust to correlation between observations from within-state groups.
The primary regression model which is estimated using the restricted sample includes TRI
concentrations and TRI concentrations squared,13 as well as controls for parental characteristics, real
per capita income and medicaid transfers. As described above, air pollution concentrations for PM10
and ozone are included to control for mobile sources of toxic pollution, allowing as well for the

possibility of health effects caused directly by those pollutants; our control for the percentage of nonreporting facilities and our proxy for TRI pollution releases (per sq. mile) from non-reporters are
included to account for aggregate toxic pollution concentrations attributable to non-reporters.
Hausman tests were used to test the exogeneity assumption required for (5) to yield consistent
estimators for the preferred regression; in each specification described below, the null hypothesis of
exogeneity for the TRI concentration variables of interest could not be rejected at a 5% level of
significance.14
Aggregate TRI Releases
We present the results from our estimation of the health effects of aggregate TRI
concentrations in Table 4. Column 1 is the primary model based on (5) and contains all of the
covariates described above and is estimated using the restricted sample. Column 2 re-estimates the
primary model but excludes county-level demographic variables and parental characteristics.
Column 3 is based on the full sample and excludes county-level demographic variables, parental
characteristics, PM10, and ozone. Column 4 presents the results for the model given in Column 3
further excluding TRI non-reporter controls. Column 5 summarizes the results for fetal health
outcomes using the restricted sample.
From column 1, our estimates suggest that aggregate TRI concentrations from reporting
facilities in the manufacturing sector, although positive, do not have a statistically significant effect
on infant or fetal health outcomes. These results are robust to the exclusion of parental characteristics and county-level income variables in the restricted sample (column 2), and parental

characteristics, county-level income, non-reporting toxic concentration proxies, and criteria air
pollution concentrations (column 3 and 4) in the full sample. Note that the coefficient estimates are
remarkably stable in magnitude across all specifications and samples.
Although we do not report the estimates here, we do not find statistically significant effects
on infant mortality rates for PM10 or ozone concentrations, which is consistent with the California
results in Currie and Neidell (2005) but not with Greenstone and Chay (2003a). It should be noted,
however, that there is very little variation in the concentrations of PM10 and ozone both across county
and over time in our sample. This could make their effects on infant and fetal health outcomes
difficult to identify. And, as found in earlier health-pollution studies, per capita income levels and
income transfers also do not appear to have a measurable effect on infant and fetal health outcomes.
We do find positive and (sometimes) statistically significant results for our two TRI non-reporter
controls, which suggests that as both the percentage of non-reporters and the number of non-reporters
in dirtier industries increases within a county, infant mortality rates rise.15
One possible explanation for why we do not find any health effects from aggregate TRI
concentrations is that this measure obscures important heterogeneity in health effects either across
pollution media, toxic chemical categories, or both. We turn now to these possibilities.
TRI by Land, Sea, and Air
The first question of interest is whether different pollution media have differential effects on
health. For example, infants undergo direct exposure to air pollution and their less-developed
15

There is multicollinearity between one of the proxy variables and some of the county-level

demographic characteristics which sometimes lowers the significance level, however, joint tests of
significance between the proxy variables and the county demographic variables show statistical significance.
These findings are consistent throughout our results.

-28-

pulmonary capacity may adversely affect their ability to deal with inhaled airborne toxins. They may
thus be more susceptible to air than water pollution. Fetuses, on the other hand, are exposed to both
air and water pollution only through maternal exposure. The mechanisms through which maternal
exposure lead to fetal exposure almost surely differ across pollution media.
We preface the discussion of our results here with a cautionary word: although we believe
that our measure for toxic air pollution concentrations (pounds of toxic pollution divided by countysquare miles) is reasonable, we are less certain about the accuracy of this measure for either water
or land pollution. It is highly likely that the relevant area around a polluting source for the
determination of exposure is much smaller for water and land pollution than for air pollution. We
therefore expect that the degree of measurement error associated with our water and land pollution
variables would lead to greater attenuation bias and more imprecise estimators.
In Table 5, we report estimates based on TRI concentrations partitioned by air, water, and
“land,” where land simply denotes the residual releases once air and water releases have been
accounted for. We include quadratic terms for all TRI concentration variables. What we observe
now is that both TRI air and water concentrations have strong, statistically significant effects on
infant, but not fetal, mortality rates. Toxic releases into the land do not appear to affect either infant
or fetal mortality.
Focusing on air releases, we observe that TRI air concentrations have strong, statistically
significant effects on infant, but not fetal, mortality rates. From the estimates in column 1 of Table
5, we calculate the implied county-level, annual toxic air concentration elasticity (or, more precisely,
the toxic air concentration from TRI reported on-site releases elasticity on infant mortality),
measured at the mean, as 0.03. With an annual average decline in toxic air concentrations of
-29-

approximately 9.47% per year (measured over our 14 year sample), this suggests that the decline in
toxic air concentrations between 1989 and 2002 saved over 9,979 infant lives. Using a value of a
statistical life of between $1.8M and $8.7M, the cost savings would be approximately $18B to
$86.8B. Similarly for water concentrations, we estimate an implied county-level, annual toxic water
concentration elasticity, measured at the mean, of 0.004. Given an annual average decline of 12.4%
in toxic water concentrations, we estimate that the decline in toxic water concentrations during our
sample period led to a savings of approximately 1,716 infant lives. Taken together, approximately
11,694 infant lives were saved. Using a value of a statistical life of between $1.8M and $8.7M, the
cost savings would be approximately $21.05B to $101.7B. (See Table 7.)
In the medium-based partitioned regression, we continue to find no statistically significant
effects of criteria air pollution concentrations, per capita income, or transfers. And, consistent with
our findings using aggregate TRI concentrations, the coefficients on our two controls for non-TRI
reporter concentrations are positive and statistically significant here, as well.
We find our estimators for toxic air concentrations to be robust across various model
specifications, although somewhat less so for toxic water concentrations once criteria air pollution
concentrations are no longer included in the model. This might suggest correlation across these
variables or sample selection bias associated with county-level characteristics associated with having
air monitoring stations for both PM10 and ozone. A more likely explanation, however, is that toxic
water and land concentrations are not as well measured as toxic air concentrations using our
methodology and the attenuation bias more pronounced for these estimators.
TRI Carcinogens, Developmental, and Reproductive Toxins
Exposures to carcinogens and to developmental/reproductive toxins are thought to be
-30-

particularly hazardous to human health. Here, then, we look to see whether toxic releases that are
either known or suspected carcinogens or developmental/reproductive toxins have a measurable
effect on infant and fetal mortality rates.
Because our earlier findings show that different pollution media have differential effects on
health, we now parse aggregate TRI releases by both media (air, water, and land) and chemical
category (carcinogenic, developmental/reproductive, “other”), including a separate variable for each
of the 9 different categories. In doing so, however, we recognize that we may not obtain statistically
significant results, as we lose a great deal of variation in these more narrowly defined chemical
categories by media. Regression results are summarized in Table 6.
Of toxic air releases, carcinogenic air concentrations have the largest adverse effect on infant
mortality, whereas developmental/reproductive toxins do not appear to have any measurable effect.
With a coefficient estimate of 0.29 on the linear term and -0.0032 on the quadratic term, the implied
elasticity for carcinogenic air concentrations is 0.0027.

The average annual reduction in

carcinogenic air concentrations during our sample period was 23.6%. Accumulated over 14 years,
this suggests a reduction in infant lives lost of 2,179, or a valuation of between $3.9B and $19B.
(See Table 7.)
Air toxins that are neither carcinogens nor developmental/reproductive toxins also have a
significant effect on infant mortality. This result is robust over all of our estimated specifications,
with coefficient estimates on the toxic air concentration variables remaining quite stable. We
estimate that given an annual county-level decline of 9.3% over 14 years, the reduction in noncarcinogenic/developmental/reproductive toxins saved approximately 9,860 infant lives. Taken
together with the lives saved from the reduction in carcinogenic air concentrations, we estimate an
-31-

aggregate reduction in lives lost from the reduction in toxic air concentrations of approximately
12,039, valued at between $21.7B and $104.7B.
We also find that concentrations of non-carcinogenic, non-developmental/reproductive toxins
in water may also have an adverse effect on infant mortality, although the robustness of this result
disappears if criteria air pollutant concentrations are not included in our model. This is similar to
the pattern that we observed when we had TRI concentrations broken down only by pollution
medium, and may suggest some important correlations across the toxic water variables and the
criteria air pollution concentration variables, sample selection issues, or attenuation bias.
If we include criteria air pollution concentrations in our model, we find that toxic water
pollution concentrations that are not carcinogenic or developmental/reproductive toxins also affect
infant mortality. The coefficient estimates here are similar to those found for non-carcinogenic, nondevelopmental/reproductive air releases. Over the 14-year sample period, we estimate that over
1,774 infant lives were saved from the approximately 12.2% average annual county-level decline in
toxic water concentrations.
VIII.

ADDITIONA L CHECKS FOR ROBUSTNESS
Because of the complicated nature of our data, it is important to ensure that our findings are

not driven by sample selection, spurious correlation, or outliers. We discuss these issues, below.
Timing: A potential concern that we must address is the timing of births and deaths. In our
analysis, year t mortality is regressed on year t pollution concentrations; however, if mortality occurs
at the beginning of the year, then year t-1 pollution concentrations might be more relevant to the
health outcome than year t’s. Without being able to match up calendar-year births and deaths
accurately, it is not possible to test the potential problem of "timing" directly, without introducing
-32-

other methodological problems such as sample selection bias.

With this understanding, we

construct a data set that limits the set of births and deaths that we study to one that satisfies the
following conditions for infants: if a death occurs, the death must occur before the end of December
in a given calendar year, and the infant must have been conceived during the same calendar year.
If the infant were carried to full term, this would mean that the infant must have been born no earlier
than September of that same year. By constructing the data in this way, all pre- and post-natal
exposure will occur in the same year as the death; hence there is no “timing” issue. Caution should
be used in interpreting the coefficient estimates from this “September-cohort” data as there may be
sample selection bias inherent in the construction of the sample. As a second check, we also re-run
our original model including leads and lags for all toxic pollution variables. A priori, we would
expect that if timing is not an issue, neither leads nor lags will be statistically significant. Results
for these robustness tests are summarized in Table 8.
Note that for simplicity, we focus only on the model specification that breaks TRI
concentrations down by media. Columns 1 and 2 use the September-cohort and estimates the effects
of TRI concentrations on infant mortality. Column 1 contains all covariates except for PM10 and
ozone concentrations to allow for the maximum number of county-years to be included in the
sample; column 2 only contains the TRI concentration variables. In both cases, the coefficient
estimators on TRI air are statistically significant and are very similar in magnitude to the coefficient
estimators reported in Table 5. So, even when restricting ourselves to a September-cohort where
timing issues do not exist, our coefficient estimators remain approximately the same. In columns
3 through 5, we re-estimate the models presented in Table 5 including leads and lags. In all but one
specification do we find a statistically significant coefficient on a lead or lag variable. We believe
-33-

that given these results, timing issues are not problematic in our estimates.
Spurious Correlation: We must be concerned also about the possibility of spurious
correlation driving our results. To ensure that this is not the case, we follow Greenstone and Chay’s
(2003a) methodology and re-estimate our model using external infant deaths as our dependent
variable. External infant deaths include those from automobile accidents, murder, and trauma –
deaths that should not be related to toxic pollution concentrations. Our TRI concentration variables
should not be statistically significant in a regression with external infant mortality rates as the
dependent variable if our results are not driven by spurious correlation. Regression results are
provided in Tables 4 through 6, column 7. Note that these regressions are run on the restricted
sample as they include controls for PM10 and ozone, although the results do not change if the
unrestricted sample is used for the estimation. In only one case do we find a statistically significant
coefficient on any of our TRI variables. This is in the specification which breaks TRI releases by
medium and pollution category and is for the coefficient on the squared term of the residual water
concentration (non-carcinogenic, non developmental or reproductive toxin). The coefficient is
significant only at the 10% level, so we conclude that overall, our results are not driven by spurious
correlation.
Outliers: Finally, we exclude a small number (4) of outliers from our regression analysis.
These observations lie approximately 3 standard deviations away above the mean value of aggregate
TRI releases, and appear to be due to data entry errors that had not been corrected as of 2005. To
ensure robustness over our sample, however, we checked the stability of our results over different
outlier criteria; results are robust over all specifications.
IX.

CONCLUSION
-34-

Although the release of toxic chemicals is not directly regulated, the potential health effects
could be significant. Our objective has been to study those health effects on two of the most
vulnerable groups in society – infants and the unborn. The primary question of concern is whether
at the current levels of toxic releases and their corresponding levels of toxic concentrations there are
measurable adverse health consequences. Our analysis of the data suggests that there are potentially
large, statistically significant effects on infant mortality rates at the county-level with increases in
toxic concentrations, which would be obscured by looking only at aggregate TRI releases because
of heterogeneity in health effects across media and chemical categories. Between 1989 and 2002,
we estimate that the decline in county-level TRI concentrations in the manufacturing sector saved
over 12,000 infant lives, at an estimated value of between $22B and $104B. It is important to note,
however, that the above number of lives saved may be significantly underestimated. By constructing
proxy variables to control for toxic releases from non-TRI reporting sources, we find statistical
evidence that their contribution to toxic concentrations may also have an adverse effect on health
outcomes.
From a policy perspective, our findings suggests if government programs were to be
developed to encourage reductions in toxic releases, the biggest health benefits for infants would
come from policies aimed at reducing toxic air releases, in general, and carcinogens, in particular.
Our findings also suggest that much more information should be collected from current nonreporting facilities. Even if each non-reporting facility released a very small amount of toxic
pollution into the environment, given the sheer number of non-reporters in the manufacturing sector,
their aggregate contribution would be significant. Current TRI policy is contemplating the reduction
of reporting requirements by TRI facilities, which would include allowing fewer facilities to report
-35-

their toxic releases to the public. Such a policy clearly would be detrimental to improving our
understanding of how toxic releases affect health outcomes.
Our results are based on crude measures of concentration and exposure and more precise
measures could help to refine our findings. Further study also is needed to determine whether there
are specific chemicals that are driving the results, or, whether it is the general mix of chemicals that
are released into the environment that is doing the harm. Spatial analysis may be important to
determine whether proximity to a TRI-producing facility or an “off-site” treatment facility may lead
to higher levels of adverse health outcomes, as well as to whether there are “cross-border” spill-overs
– whether the border is at the zip-code, county, or state level. We suspect that with more refined
geographic information on the residence of the pregnant woman that we could obtain more
statistically reliable results on the effects of toxic water and land pollution exposure on fetal and
infant health.
The lack of general regulatory oversight on toxic emissions is almost surely because of the
belief that low levels of toxic pollution concentrations are not harmful to human health. Our results,
however, strongly suggest that the effects of exposure, even at the current levels of concentrations,
are far from benign, at least for infants under 1 year of age.
