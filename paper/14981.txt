The illustrative empirical analysis on the value of individual amenities is the first to simultaneously present the value of multiple amenities to both firms and households. A few amenities
statistically predict most of the variation in trade-productivity and total amenity value. Simple
cross-sectional hedonic methods produce estimates of the impact of population and education levels on productivity consistent with more sophisticated analyses (e.g. Moretti 2004, Rosenthal and
Strange 2004). Measuring their value per acre, the most productive and valuable cities are not only
large and educated, but also mild, sunny, and coastal.2
This article is part of a larger body of research applying and refining the Rosen-Roback model
with local-good production and federal taxes, first introduced in Albouy (2009). As the title suggests, the article here presents new and unique results about identifying local productivity, inferring
land rents, and describing how amenity values are capitalized into local prices. The Albouy (2009)
article emphasizes how federal taxes distort local prices and location decisions, while the analysis
below describes how taxes affect the capitalization of amenities, using intuitive formulae and quantifying the amounts. It also estimates what individual amenities are correlated with tax payments.
Albouy (2008) presents quality-of-life estimates that are complementary to local productivity in
accounting for the total value of amenities. By focusing on households and ignoring land and production, the paper says nothing on capitalization. Albouy and Stuart (2013) build from the analysis
below and uses the quality-of-life and trade-productivity estimates to predict population densities
in U.S. metropolitan areas with surprising accuracy. Albouy and Ehrlich (2012) also build from
the analysis below: they construct a land-value index using recent market transactions data, and
use it to estimate a cost function for housing and measure differences in housing productivity.3
2
Articles that consider the local productivity of firms with only the tradeable sector include Rauch (1993), Dekle
and Eaton (1999), Haughwout (2002), Glaeser and Saiz (2004), and Chen and Rosenthal (2008). Rappaport (2008a,
2008b) is the only author that accounts for locally produced goods, although he restricts home-productivity and tradeproductivity to be equal. His model excludes taxes. It is used for simulation purposes, without analytical solutions or
applications to data.

The implications of the findings in this work are discussed section 4.5.

The Relationship between Amenities and Equilibrium Prices

2.1

Model Set-up and Notation

I model a system of cities, indexed by j, each small relative to the national economy. Cities share
a homogenous population of mobile households. Households consume a numeraire traded good,
x, and a non-traded "home" good, y, with local price, pj . The price of home goods is measured by
the flow cost of housing services.4
Firms produce traded and home goods out of land, capital, and labor. Within a city, factors
receive the same payment in either sector. Land, L, within each city is homogenous and immobile.
Land is paid a city-specific price rj , which determine its supply, Lj (rj ). Capital, K, is fully
mobile across cities and is paid the price { everywhere. The supply of capital in each city, K j , is
perfectly elastic at this price, while the national level of capital may be fixed or free. Households,
N , are fully mobile, have identical tastes and endowments, and each supplies a single unit of labor.
Because households care about local prices and quality of life, wages, wj , may vary across cities.
P
Nationally, the total number of households is N T OT = j N j .
Households own identical, nationally-diversified, portfolios of land and capital. Payments to
P
P
these factors are rebated lump sum: R = NT1OT j rj Lj from land and I = NT1OT j {K j from

capital. Total income, mj
a federal income tax of

R + I + wj , varies across cities only as wages vary.5 Households pay

(m), which the federal government redistributes in uniform lump-sum

payments. As deductions and state taxes play a minor role, they are discussed in Appendix A.
Cities differ in three general "urban attributes:" (i) quality of life, Qj ; (ii) trade-productivity,
AjX ; and (iii) home-productivity, AjY . These attributes depend on a vector of unspecified city amenij
fY (Zj ). A
e (Zj ), Aj = A
fX (Zj ), and Aj = A

), through functions Qj = Q

Think of housing goods as a subset of non-tradable goods. Theoretically, housing costs may proxy for costdifferences in all locally-provided goods. Non-housing goods, such as haircuts and restaurant meals, are considered
to be a composite commodity of traded goods and non-housing home goods, with price pj . I discuss multiple types of
home goods in Appendix D.2, which shows that if housing is more land-intensive than non-housing home goods, then
housing will more strongly reflect amenity values.
5
As argued in Helpman and Pines (1980), as well as Albouy (2009), assuming only wages depend on location is
the most appropriate assumption for mobile households.

e
consumption amenity, e.g., safety or clement weather, improves quality of life: @ Q=@Z
k > 0.

Analogously, for a trade-productive amenity, e.g., navigable water or agglomeration economies,

fX =@Zk > 0; and for a home-productive amenity, e.g., flat geography or the absence of land-use
@A
fY =@Zk > 0. An amenity may affect more than one attribute, or affect an attribute
restrictions, @ A
negatively: flat land may be an amenity to housing producers and a disamenity to households. A
priori the two productivities may be uncorrelated. San Francisco may be great at making software
and terrible at making housing. Nationally, each attribute has an average value of one.

2.2

Equilibrium Conditions

The utility function U (x; y; Qj ) ; representing household preferences, is quasi-concave over x and
y, and increases in quality of life, Qj . The dual expenditure function for a household, e(pj ; u; Qj ) ,
measures the cost of consumption needed to attain utility u, increases in pj , and decreases in Qj .
Because households are fully mobile, all inhabited cities offer the same utility, u.6 Thus, firms
in cities with high prices or low quality of life compensate their workers with greater after-tax
income:
e(pj ; u; Qj ) = wj + R + I

(wj + R + I):

(1)

Operating under perfect competition, firms produce traded and home goods according to the
functions X = AjX FX (LX ; NX ; KX ) and Y = AjY FY (LY ; NY ; KY ), where FX and FY are concave and exhibit constant returns to scale, so that any returns to scale are embedded within the
factor-neutral productivities, AjX and AjY : All factors are fully employed, mobile across sectors
within each city, and thus, have a single price in each city. The unit cost of producing a traded
good is cX (rj ; wj ; {; AjX ) = cX (rj ; wj ; {)=AjX where c(r; w; i)

c(r; w; i; 1).7 A symmetric defin-

ug. The use of a single index Qj assumes that
Formally, e(pj ; u; Qj )
minx;y fx + pj y : U x; y; Qj
amenities are weakly separable from consumption. The model generalizes to one with heterogenous workers that
supply different fixed amounts of labor if these workers are perfect substitutes in production, have identical homothetic
preferences, and earn equal shares of income from labor. Additonally, the mobility condition need not apply to all
households, but only a sufficiently large subset of mobile marginal households (Gyourko and Tracy 1989). Appendix
D.1 discusses the case with multiple household types that vary in preferences and skills.
7
Unit cost is cX (rj ; wj ; {; AjX ) minL;N;K frj L + wj N + {K : AjX F (L; N; K) = 1g: Appendix D.1 demonstrates that productivity differences that are not Hicks-neutral have similar impacts on relative prices across cities, but
6

ition holds for the unit cost of a home good, cY . Firms make zero profits in equilibrium. Therefore,
for given output prices, more productive cities pay higher rents and wages, equal to the marginal
revenue products of land and labor. In equilibrium, the following zero-profit conditions hold:
cX (rj ; wj ; {)=AjX = 1

(2)

cY (rj ; wj ; {)=AjY = pj :

(3)

This model of spatial equilibrium in (1), (2), and (3) uses duality theory to elegantly map the
three prices (rj ; wj ; pj ) one-to-one with the three attributes (Qj ; AjX ; AjY ). When all three prices
are observed, the three attributes are exactly identified. Since these equations are equilibrium
conditions, they hold even when the attributes are endogenous, e.g., if they change with population
N j . If prices were different, firms or households would move. Thus, the dual conditions are wellsuited for measuring attribute values through prices. The conditions are less suited for counterfactual comparative statics as they do not capture feedback on amenities Zj . This makes it more
difficult to estimate the value of individual amenities. For example, lowering crime, Z1j , may
increase Qj , increasing the population N j = Z2j , which could then change Qj , AjX , or AjY .8
As mentioned earlier, Roback (1982) presents the same three-equation model without taxes,
but uses data on land rents in a simplified two-equation model, which reduces equation (3) to
rj = pj . As explained below, this "reduced model" is quite problematic when local labor is used
to make non-traded goods (see Tolley 1974) and when home-productivity differs across cities.
Starting with Blomquist et al. (1988), Beeson and Eberts (1989), and Gyourko and Tracy (1989,
1991), subsequent analyses have used the two-equation model, but replaced land rents with housing
values. This is an improvement for modeling households, who consume housing directly, but
problematic for firms, who use land as an input.9 The three-equation model is more realistic and
not on quantities.
8
To appreciate the potential complexity of comparative statics, say that N j increases AjX so that AjX = AjX0 (N j ) ;
where > 0, and AjX0 is exogenous. If a city’s transportation network improves, increasing AjX0 , this will attract
new workers, raising N j and further increasing AjX , confounding the effect. Yet, one may measure the value of the
transportation improvement by controlling for population if can be properly estimated.
9
While Roback (1982) applies her two-equation model with actual land values, she also expresses strong doubts

he more narrowly confines home goods to housing, using a smaller sy = 0:18 and a larger L = 0:35. His implied
L = 0:17 is quite similar, whereas N = 0:87 is smaller.

Log-Linearization of the Equilibrium Conditions

To deepen the analysis and for empirical application, I log-linearize conditions (1), (2), and (3).
These conditions relate each city’s price differentials to its attribute differentials. The differentials
are in logarithms: for any z, z^j = d ln z j = dz j =z = (z j

z) =z approximates the percent

difference in city j of z; relative to the national geometric average z. The one exception to this
^j
notation is Q

(@e=@Q) (1=m)dQj , which is the dollar value of a change in Qj divided by

income.

These equations are first-order approximations of the equilibrium conditions around a nationallyrepresentative city, and thus use national shares.12
Each equilibrium condition states that the relative value of a city’s amenities is measured implicitly by how much households or firms will pay for them. Equation (4a) measures local quality
of life from how high the cost-of-living, sy p^j , is relative to after-tax nominal income, sw (1

The equations so far resemble that of Albouy (2009), which uses the same framework, but
considers different issues. Henceforth, the insights below are largely new and focus on issues of
missing land rents, local productivity, and amenity values. With data on wages, home-good prices,

and land rents, equations (4a) to (4c) produce estimates of the attribute differentials Q

The first equation is log-linearized by dividing through by m, and the third, by dividing by p. As shown by Hochman
and Pines (1993), it is the marginal tax rate on wage income that matters.
12
Most of these first-order expressions hold exactly in a Cobb-Douglas economy, where elasticities of substitution
are one. In fact, these elasticities appear to be slightly less than one (Albouy 2009, Albouy and Stuart 2013), but close
enough that they matter little for the fairly small range of observed wages and housing costs observed in the United
States. As discussed in Appendix B.3, second-order approximations of the equilibrium conditions, which account for
endogenous shifts of the share values, do not produce appreciably different inferences under plausible parametrizations
except at the very extremes of the data.

Inferring Land Rents and Trade-Productivity from Housing Costs

When applied to housing, the zero-profit condition for home-good producers (4c) demonstrates
how housing costs differ from land rents, except in a reduced model where

L

= 1 and

N

=

A^jY = 0. Solving for land rents, we can summarize the difference in three ways:

First, labor costs,

, must be subtracted away to isolate housing-cost differences due to land.

Second, the observable remainder, p^j

, must be divided by

L,

the cost share of land.

The intuition here is simple: if a 1-percent housing-price difference comes from land, and land
is 1/4 of the cost, then the land-price difference must be 4-percent. Third, land rents should be
adjusted for home-productivity, A^jY : cities with high home-productivity have housing prices that
are low relative to the value of land. Independent information on home-productivity is typically
unavailable, meaning land rents will be under-estimated in home productive areas.13
Local trade productivity may be inferred from wages and housing costs by substituting (5) into
(4b), leading to

The Capitalization of Amenity Values and their Total Value

Inverting the linear system of equations (4a) to (4c) reveals how the three urban attributes influence
the three prices. To ease comparison, I multiply each price differential by its income share, so
that each equation expresses the change in total land, labor, and home-good values relative to
local income. Thus, a one-percent increase in sR r^j represents an increase in land values equal to
one percent of local income. Each attribute is also multiplied by its weight relative to income.
Accordingly, a one-percent increase in sx A^jx has a value equal to a one-percent increase in local
income.
With these normalizations, I express prices in terms of urban attributes, using only the fractions
of land and labor in traded-good

To aid intuition, consider two extreme cases. In the first case, traded goods are made without land, i.e. L = 0.
Then, trade-productivity is proportional the wage level, A^jX = N w
^ j . This may be a reasonable approximation if L

is small, but not if the variation in r^ is much larger than w
^ . In the second case, the cost shares in both sectors are the
same, i.e. L = L , and N = N . Then, A^jX A^jY = p^j as the input costs are the same in each sector: home-good
prices may be used to infer input costs in tradables only insofar as home-productivity remains constant.
15
Wihout taxes, the linearized version of (7a) is (L=N )drj = (@e=@Q)dQj +(X=N )dAjX +(pY =N )dAjY = d j .

to express how much relative to the the national average households in a city pay in taxes as a
fraction of their income.
To understand the influence of taxes, it is key to understand wage differences, seen in (7b).The
bracketed term demonstrates how wage levels fall with quality-of-life and home-productive amenities in so far as land is used in traded production: firms lower wages to offset higher land costs in
proportion to the fraction of land they use,

(7) are derivable from equations in Albouy (2009), which contains an expression similar to (7b). The expressions
except that those those here are relative to income, and use factor (not cost) shares, , making them neater and more
interpretable.

12

Because of federal taxes, land rents over-capitalize quality-of-life and home-productive amenities to the extent that amenities lower wages: this simplifies to the tax multiplier in (7a) increasing
the capitalization of those amenities. Land values under-capitalize trade-productive amenities, as
they directly raise wages and tax burdens, creating a reduction proportional to the tax rate times
the wage multiplier,

0

(1=

N ),

seen in (7a).16 The total value of amenities is reflected in locally

appropriated land rents and federally expropriated tax revenues, ^ j = sR r^j + 0 sw w^ j . ^ j captures
differences in the social value of land, while sr r^j captures the private value, subtracting the fiscal
externality in federal taxes.
When land data are unavailable, researchers may use (5) to infer differences in total amenity
values, resulting in the following expression:

This measure is increasing in home expenditures, sy p^j , and accounts for land used in the traded

The bracketed term associated with wages is of ambiguous sign:

high wages signal high federal-tax revenues, but also high labor costs in housing. The measure
also misses differences in home-productivity by 1=(1

of their value. Even if we give up

on measuring the value of home-productivity, the value of the remaining amenities will still be
somewhat biased as ^ j

Equation (7c) expresses how amenities are capitalized into the price of housing services and
other locally-produced goods. Overall, home-good prices capitalize amenities quite differently
than land rents. First, they are subject to the wage multiplier. Second, they lose the value of qualityof-life amenities seen in lower wages (the

N

^ j undoes the wage multiplier).17
pre-multiplying Q

Wihout taxes, the linearized version of (7a) is (L=N )drj = (@e=@Q)dQj +(X=N )dAjX +(pY =N )dAjY = d j .
Per capita, (L=N )drj is the change in land value, (@e=@Q)dQj is the improvement in quality-of-life per resident,
(X=N )dAjX and and (pY =N )dAjY are the per-capita decrease in tradable and non-tradable costs. The solutions in (7)
are the same as in Albouy (2009), but expressed relative to income, and using the factor (not cost) shares, .
17
Roback (1982, p. 1265) reports a linear analogue to equation (7c) without taxes in her equation 9, expressed in
derivatives of cost and indirect utility functions. Roback states that the effect of improvements in quality-of-life on
home-good prices is ambiguous. It is unambiguous if home goods are relatively land intensive, meaning N > L :This
condition underpins Roback’s assumption that the determinant in her equation 9 ( ) is greater than zero.
16

13

Third, home-goods capture the value of productive amenities only in so-far as they affect wages,
meaning they may over-capitalize trade-productivity and under-capitalize home-productivity. The
value of productive amenities are then only capitalized net of taxes, (1

0

). After accouting for

the tax multiplier, federal taxes reduce the capitalization of both kinds of production amenities, but
increase that of quality-of-life amenities.
In combination, (7b) and (7c) underscores how trade- and home-productivity are not separately
identifiable without land rents. Trade-productivity raises the wages of workers, increasing the
demand for local goods, raising their price so that household expenditures rise in proportion to
the after-tax wage bill. Home-productive amenities lower the price of home goods through greater
supply; these lower prices attract workers and allow firms to pay them less. The two productivities
change wages and housing-cost in the same proportion in opposite directions.
In Appendix A.1, I amend the above formulae to account for tax benefits for housing lower
tax burdens, using tax differential of d j =m =

0

(sw w^ j

sy p^j ), where

2 [0; 1] is the fraction

of deductible expenses. These benefits lower tax burdens in areas with high home-good prices,
i.e., those with high quality of life or trade-productivity, or low home-productivity. Amending
(7) reveals that a higher

raises the tax multiplier and causes prices to capitalize quality-of-life

amenities more, and both types of productive amenities less.

3

Parameterized Capitalization Predictions

Using the capitalization formulas in (7), Table 2 reports how a one dollar increase in the value of a
local attribute is capitalized into local prices. To highlight the importance of federal taxes and nontraded production, the coefficients in panel A eliminate taxes and the wage multiplier by changing
the parameterization so that

0

= 0 and

has a parameterized value of 1=
at a rate of

0

N

N

= 1; panel B re-introduces the wage multiplier, which

= 1:42. Panel C cumulatively adds federal taxes on wages

= 0:36, leading to a tax multiplier of 1:09; panel D adds refinements for housing

tax-benefits and state taxes, raising the tax multiplier to 1:17:

14

The first rows of panel A and B demonstrate how land rents capitalize the value of all amenities
dollar-for-dollar in the absence of federal taxes. In Panel A, we see 81 percent of quality-of-life
values are capitalized into higher home-good prices, with 19 percent capitalized into lower wages,
so that real income falls in proportion by 100 percent. With the wage multiplier in B, wages
capitalize slightly more. The full wage multiplier effect is seen in how wages capitalize tradeproductivity, increasing it from 81 to 119 percent: more than dollar-for-dollar. These wage effects
from productivity are fully offset by higher local home-good prices. Wages and home-good prices
are barely affected by home-productivity, never reflecting more than a quarter of their value.
Federal taxes change some of the capitalization effects more than others. Moving straight to
Panel D, land rents capitalize only 63 percent of trade-productive amenity values, while the federal
government expropriates the remaining 37 percent. Meanwhile, the federal government implicitly
subsidizes quality-of-life amenities at a rate of 19 percent, and home-productive amenities at a
rate of 8 percent. A local government maximizing land rents has twice the incentive to provide
amenities to households than to traded-producing firms.
Taxes amplify wage differentials by roughly 10 percent, so that wages capitalize quality-of-life
amenities at 27 cents on the dollar. This figure is low for studies (e.g. Moore 1998) that value
quality-of-life amenities using nominal wages alone. Wages reflect an even higher percentage of
their value at 128 percent, suggesting that wage-only measures of productivity — often seen in the
agglomeration literature — may overstate differences in total factor productivity.18
For home-good prices, taxes increase the capitalization of quality-of-life to 90 percent and
decrease that of productivity to 92 percent. Home-good prices capitalize the value of qualityof-life and trade-productivity differences more accurately than land rents considered in isolation.
Home-productivity remains hard to detect with any land data.
18
Rappaport (2008b) finds a capitalization effect of quality of life on wages similar to the one here without taxes,
as his calibration implies similar values of L . For other amenities his results differ as N and 0 play more of a role.
His numerical simulations also account for non-linearities using constant-elasticity-of-substitution (CES) utility and
production functions.

Prices and the Value of Amenities across U.S. Cities

4.1

Wage and Housing-Cost Differentials

I estimate wage and housing-cost differentials exactly as in Albouy (2009) – following Gabriel
and Rosenthal’s (2004) methodology – using the 5-percent sample of Census data from the 2000
Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS). I define cities at the Metropolitan Statistical
Area (MSA) level using 1999 OMB definitions. I treat Consolidated MSAs as a single city (e.g.
New York includes Long Island and northern New Jersey), and create a single non-metropolitan
area for each state.19 This classification produces a total of 325 "cities" of which 276 are actual
metropolitan areas and 49 are non-metropolitan areas.
I regress the logarithm of hourly wages on worker characteristics and indicator variables for
each metro area. The population-demeaned coefficients on the indicator variables are taken as the
city wage differentials. I use an analogous regression for housing costs, combining gross rents with
imputed rents from owner-occupied units. Imputed rents are the sum of utility costs and a usercost imputed from housing values and a multiplier based on interest rates, tax rates, maintenance,
depreciation and capital gains. Appendix C provides more details on the variables and estimation
procedure.

4.2

20

Land-Value, Trade-Productivity, and Total-Value Measures

With wage and housing-cost differentials, I infer land-rent, quality-of-life, trade-productivity, and
total-value differentials using equations (4a), (5), (6), (8). These are parameterized according to
19

I use Consolidated MSAs to acknowledge the strong interdependence of productivity among areas within an MSA.
Non-metropolitan areas by state are included for completeness. They may be thought of as an average for those areas.
20
As shown in Appendix C.2, adjusting for local variation in user costs, such as from capital gains, has relatively
minor effects on the housing-cost differentials. The adjustment tends to lower the cost somewhat in the least expensive
cities, but does little to change the overall picture.

Without land-value data, I assume there are no home-productivity differences across cities, i.e.,
A^jY = 0, for all j. This assumption is implicit in, and far weaker than, the assumption that housing
and land are identical. The parentheses contain the biases that result from unobserved homeproductivity differences: the bias appears to be large for land rents, small for trade-productivity,
and moderate for total value. Otherwise, the total value is well-approximated by housing costs, as
the coefficient on wages in equation (8) is close to zero.
Figure 1 plots the wage and housing-cost differentials across metro areas, together with four
lines, or "curves", describing the (w^ j ; p^j ) combinations where the left-hand sides of equation are
zero, i.e., at their national averages. The iso-rent curve describes the points on (5) where r^ = 0,
namely p^j =

Nw

. The slope

N

illustrates how housing prices rise with construction costs.

The vertical distance between this line and a city’s marker, scaled by 1=

L,

provides that city’s

inferred land rent, since land accounts for the remaining costs. Figure 2 plots the inferred land-rent
differentials against housing costs. It draws a line for how these rents are inferred from housing
costs if wages are held at the national average, w^ j = 0. The dashed line’s rotation around the origin
from the diagonal illustrates the division of p^j by the cost-share of land,

L.

The vertical distance

between the dashed-line and the markers indicate the adjustments for labor costs.
Back to Figure 1, the second line is the mobility condition, (4a), in cities with average quality

The actual formulas are somewhat more complex becaue of state-tax differences. These are accounted for by
interacting state tax and deudction rates with price and wage differences within-state only. The simplified formulas

17

local costs increase with wage levels to keep real consumption levels from rising. Households in
cities above this line pay a premium relative to the wage level, which implies that their quality of
life is above average.
The third line indicates cities with average trade-productivity, A^jX = 0; using the combined
zero-profit conditions in (6). The slope of the combined condition;

N

L N = L,

gives the rate

at which land costs, proxied through housing costs, need to fall with wage levels for firms to break
even. Cities above this line have above-average costs, indicating high trade-productivity. These
cities could instead have low home-productivity, although the parameterization suggests the observed variation would require very large differences in home-productivity. The trade-productivity
estimates are graphed in Figure 3 against those we would infer from a reduced model that imposes
L

= 1;

N

= 0 and keeps the same values of

L

and

N.

The methodological refinement of putting

more weight on housing costs is not enormous, but nonetheless changes the relative rankings of
many cities, putting Los Angeles in front of Chicago, Boston in front of Detroit, and Denver in
front of Las Vegas.
Back again to Figure 1, the fourth line is an iso-value curve, (8), with ^ j = 0. It traces out
cities with average total amenity values. As housing costs indicate them well, the line is quite flat.
Figure 4 graphs the quality-of-life and trade-productivity estimates together. This graph transforms Figure 1 through a change of coordinate systems: the average mobility condition provides
the horizontal axis for trade-productivity, while the average zero-profit condition provides the vertical axis for quality of life. The axes are scaled so that equidistant attribute differences are of equal
value. The four curves pass through the coordinate change. The downward slope of the iso-rent
curve has a weaker slope than the iso-value curve, reflecting how rents capitalize quality-of-life in
greater proportion than trade-productivity. The iso-housing-cost curve has almost the same slope
as the iso-value line, as it capitalizes each attribute in almost equal proportions. The upwardsloping iso-wage curve illustrates how wages capitalize productivity positively, and quality of life
negatively by a smaller proportion.

The Most Trade-Productive and Valuable Cities

Table 3A lists the estimated wage, housing-cost, land-rent, quality-of-life, trade-productivity, federaltax, and total-amenity-value differentials for select cities. The table also lists average values by
Census division, and metro-area size. Table 3B presents the top 20 rankings for trade-productivity,
quality of life, and total amenity value. Appendix Table A1 presents a complete list of metro areas
and non-metro areas; Appendix Table A2 lists values by state.
The tendency for trade-productivity to increase with metro population, usually attributed to
agglomeration economies, is illustrated in Figure 5. The most trade-productive metro area is San
Francisco, which includes Silicon Valley. It is surprising that the most productive metro is only
the fifth largest, while New York, the largest, is second. Yet, the exceptional degree of knowledge
spillovers and innovation in the San Francisco Bay Area is well documented (Saxenian 1994,
Florida 2008). The top ten most productive cities contains five other large metros – Los Angeles,
Chicago, Boston, Washington, and Detroit (back in 2000) – and three small metros – Monterrey
(officially "Salinas"), Santa Barbara, and Hartford. The most plausible explanation for why these
small metros are so productive is that they are close to much larger metros (San Francisco, Los
Angeles, and Boston). In contrast, the least productive metro area, Great Falls, MT, is remote, as
are the two least productive states, South and North Dakota.
Combining quality-of-life and trade-productivity, the most valuable metropolis is San Francisco: it has the highest productivity and the fourth highest quality of life. It is followed by six
other Pacific cities – Santa Barbara, Honolulu, Monterrey, San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Luis
Obispo – that offer exceptional quality of life and fairly high productivity. Next, are a number of
large, highly productive, and somewhat amenable metros – New York, Seattle, Boston, Denver,
Chicago, and Portland – as well as resort-like, yet economically vibrant, metros like Cape Cod,
Santa Fe, Naples, Reno, and Fort Collins.
Further down the list are smaller cities in less crowded areas, such as in Arkansas, Oklahoma,
West Virginia, Mississippi, and the Dakotas. The relationship between total amenity value and city
size is quite apparent in Figure 6: it combines the strong relationship between size and produc19

tivity, seen above, and the weak relationship between size and quality of life (Albouy 2008). The
estimates suggest that an acre of land in the San Francisco Bay Area is on average 100 times more
valuable than an acre in McAllen, TX (Hidalgo County), with the lowest value.22

4.4

Explaining the Variation of Prices across Cities

The theory of spatial equilibrium asserts that price variation across cities reflects differences in
amenities, reduced here to two attributes: quality of life and trade-productivity. A variance decomposition of the total value of amenities yields:
^ j ) + s2x var(A^j ) + 2sx cov(Q
^ j ; A^j ):
var( ^ j ) = var(Q
X
X

(10)

One way to assess the relative importance of each attribute is to compare the two variance terms:
if one attribute is made constant, then the covariance term collapses to zero, and only the variance
of the other attribute remains. From the equations in (7), it is straightforward to derive similar
decomposition formulae for wages, housing costs, and land rents.23 This statistical decomposition
must be treated cautiously as attributes may be endogenous, especially the numbers in Panel B,
which remove taxes. For example, as discussed in Section 2.2, high quality of life may raise
population, leading to endogenous trade-productivity gains from agglomeration; federal taxes may
interact with these feedback effects. The decomposition does provide an interesting accounting of
equilibrium relationships, and should describe some causal effects if the endogenous feedback is
weak, as the analysis in Albouy and Stuart (2013) suggests.
Table 4 displays the decompositions for the prices, with Panel A giving the case with taxes,
22

The results change only slightly if housing-cost measures based only on rental units are used. Rent measures
better represent the situation in central cities, where 45% of households are renters, rather than in suburbs, where only
27% are renters. Rent-only measures tend to be somewhat lower in places with many renters, like California, and in
cities like Detroit, where the central city and suburbs offer very different amenities. Using only rents tends to lower
quality-of-life and trade-productivity estimates in cities where rents are low relative to housing prices..
23
This decomposition is unlike the one in Beeson and Eberts (1989) and Deitz and Abel (2008), who decompose
each differential into its productivity and quality-of-life component. For instance, San Francisco’s wage differential of
0.26 is 119 percent "explained" by its higher productivity (which alone rasies it to 0.31) and -19 percent "explained"
by its higher quality of life (which alone lowers it -0.05).

20

and Panel B without. Overall, trade-productivity accounts for a greater fraction of amenity value
than quality-of-life. This is seen in Figure 4: when population-weighted, the width of the spread of
cities along the trade-productivity axis is greater the height of the spread than along the quality-oflife axis. Quality-of life does have a greater influence on land rents by a slight margin. Variations in
nominal wages – as well as federal-tax burdens – are driven almost entirely by trade-productivity.
This contradicts Roback’s (1982) claim that nominal wages vary more from quality-of-life.24 If
trade-productivity determines labor demand, and quality of life determines labor supply, then labor
demand is more important in determining wage levels. Housing-cost variation also appears to be
driven mainly by trade-productivity.25
Panel B presents a counter-factual distribution of rents, wages, and housing-costs with federal
taxes removed, holding the attributes fixed. In this case, productivity differences would be even
more important in determining land rents and housing costs.

4.5

Comparison with Land Data from Market Transactions

I now consider the validity of the current article in light of new work by Albouy and Ehrlich (2012),
which builds on the analysis here. They collect 2005-10 data on land transactions to produce an
index of land values comparable across metro areas. Their samples are much smaller than the
Census, making the indices prone to sampling error. Nevertheless, they find two-thirds of the
variation in housing prices is explained by land values and wages, with cost estimates similar to
the ones here. Land values are far more dispersed than housing costs, as predicted, and housingproductivity differs substantially and appears influenced by geography and land-use regulations.
The findings are generally supportive of the results here with three caveats. First, cities with
high land values tend to have lower housing productivity, meaning that inferred land values in
these cities may be too high. Second, housing-productivity is negatively correlated with trade24

Roback (1982) concludes that "the combined evidence seems persuasive that the regional differences in earnings
can be largely accounted for by regional differences in local amenities," referring to quality-of-life amenities only.
Using different time periods does not change the preponderance of trade-productivty in determining wage levels.
25
It is not clear from the analysis which type of amenity is more important in affecting household location choices.
This is explored in Albouy and Stuart (2013).

21

productivity. This causes estimates of trade-productivity with inferred land values to be slightly
biased and exaggerated. Third, the elasticity of substitution between land and non-land inputs
in housing production is estimated just below one, although imprecisely. If so, a second-order
approximation of (3) – described in Appendix B.3 – will produce better inferred land values than
the first-order approximation in (5).
Albouy and Ehrlich’s conclusions are open to the criticism that transaction data may not reflect
the value of non-transacted land because vacant land may be negatively selected (Mills 1992, Case
1995), particularly in high-value areas. If so, land values and home-productivity may be underestimated in cities with high land values, possibly negating the caveats above. Furthermore, the
data come from the housing boom-and-bust period, when land and housing prices may have inaccurately reflected local amenities, particularly for housing production. These problems aside, data
on land transactions are still thin, proprietary, and available only for recent years.26 The lessons
derived in the absence of land-value data, derived here, are more practical for most researchers.

5

The Value of Individual Amenities

Researchers commonly use the spatial equilibrium model to estimate the value of individual amenij
ties (Z1j ; ::; ZK
) through regression methods. One branch of the literature, starting with Roback

(1982), focuses on quality of life; another, exemplified by Rauch (1993), focuses on trade-productivity.
Here, I analyze them together, similar to Haughwout (2002), except that I examine multiple amenities with taxes and home-production. I illustrate the inter-relationships by running seven, mutuallyconsistent regressions, assumed to be linear for simplicity:

vj =

X

Zkj

kv

+ "jv ;

(11)

k

26
Such problems may also present in the time series of land values presented by Nichols et al. (2013), which
are not comparable cross-sectionally. Davis and Palumbo (2007) infer the costs of land rents across metropolitan
areas by subtracting construction costs, obtained from R.S. Means, from observed housing data. In many ways, this
methodology is similar to the one in equation (5), and subject to similar caveats. Their methodology also implicitly
assumes that new suburban houses are representative.

22

^ A^X ; r^; d =m; ^ g. In this linear system, the amenity coefficients,

the effect of a one-unit increase in an amenity to the regressor. The amenity coefficients,

kv ,

share the same interrelationships as their corresponding regressors, v, in the above equations, e.g.
from (5),

rk

= (1=

L ) pk

(

N = L ) wk

for each k.

The regressions use two types of amenity measures, shown in Table 5. The first type measure
"natural" amenities, such as climate and geography: heating-degree days (which measure cold)
and cooling-degree days (which measure heat) per year, sunshine out of the fraction possible,
latitude, average inverse distance to a major coast, and average slope of terrain – Appendix C lists
the data sources. The second type measure "artificial" amenities that depend on local inhabitants,
including metropolitan (MSA/CMSA) population and the share of the adults with college degrees.
These are not true amenities, per se, but likely determine amenities that are key to local tradeproductivity, engendering agglomeration economies and knowledge spillovers. I also include the
Wharton Residential Land-Use Regulatory Index (WRLURI), by Gyourko et al. (2008) to control
for housing-productivity differences, which may contaminate the estimates of r^, A^X , and ^ if
A^Y 6= 0.
These regressions estimate the impact of individual amenities on observed wages and housing
costs, w^ and p^ in columns 1 and 2 of Table 5. Columns 3 and 4 report regressions separating the
^ and A^X . Their combined value, ^ , is expressed
value of the amenity to households and to firms, Q
in column 7; how the capitalization of total value is split between land values and federal tax
revenues, sR r^ and d =m, is in columns 5 and 6.
Cross-sectional regressions of this kind are subject to well-known empirical caveats (see Gyourko et al. 1999) due to omitted variables, simultaneity, multi-collinearity, and small samples.
Including more variables may not alleviate these caveats, partly because there are more potential variables than observations. Adding endogenous variables can bias estimates further, as can
adding exogenous variables if the variable list is incomplete. Ultimately, researchers are unsure
of the "true" specification in this setting – a problem shared with cross-country regressions (see
Sala-i-Martin 1997) – and so each variable may proxy for several amenities. To test robustness,

23

Appendix Table A3 reports results excluding the second set of endogenous amenities; Appendix
Table A4 includes additional endogenous amenities and population characteristics. For the variables common to these specifications, the same conclusions generally apply.27
The first row of table 5 estimates an elasticity of wages with respect to population of 3.8
percent. This effect may be endogenous to more workers choosing to live in more productive areas,
but the estimates are squarely inside the range of estimates surveyed in Rosenthal and Strange
(2004) and Melo et al. (2009). The elasticity of housing-costs to population is larger at 5.6 percent.
The results in an elasticity of trade-productivity of 3.6 percent, close to that for wages, and an
elasticity of quality of life of zero. In total, the estimates suggest that doubling city population (an
increase of 0.69 log points) increases the total value of its amenities by 1.5 percent of income, of
which three-fifths is capitalized in local land values and two-fifths is appropriated in federal taxes.
Thus, federal taxes should dampen the incentives for local landowners to welcome growth in their
cities.
The estimates in the second row associate a ten-percentage point increase in college-educated
adults (1.3 standard deviations) with 7-percentage point increases in wages and productivity, and a
1.8 percentage point increase in quality of life. Of course, highly-educated workers may be most
attracted to a city with high quality of life and productivity. Nevertheless, the results resemble those
of Moretti (2004) and Shapiro (2006), who use more rigorous methods involving instrumental
variables. In total, a ten-percent increase in college share is associated with a 7-percent increase in
the total value of amenities, of which federal taxes expropriate one-fifth.
The positive coefficients on the regulatory land-use index (WRLURI) for trade-productivity,
land rents, and total value are consistent with the prediction that regulations lower housing-productivity.
The effects are small and insignificant, suggesting our inferred measures are not biased badly by
27
The coefficients on the natural amenity variables in Table A3 are almost all larger in absolute magnitude than in
Table 5 as amenable areas are more populated, and the college-educated live more in northern and coastal areas. Table
A4 includes variables for race (percent black, percent Hispanic), age (percent under 18, over 65), culture, restaurants
and bars, air quality and crime. Most of these variables are insignificant, with the main exception of air quality.
Clean air is positively associated with trade-productivity, quality of life, and total amenity value. Cities with cleaner
industries tend to be more productive, running against the more causal view that allowing firms to pollute will lower
their costs.

24

unobserved housing-productivity.
The relationships between the natural amenities and trade-productivity, new to the literature,
reveal interesting patterns. Sunshine, coastal proximity, low levels of cold (minus heating degree
days) and low levels of heat (minus cooling degree days) appear to be amenities to firms as well
as households. The positive estimate for coastal proximity may reflect savings in transportation
costs; the climate effects are more surprising, but could have a physiological basis. Montesquieu
(1748) hypothesized long ago that extreme temperatures inhibit the ability of humans to work.
Engineering studies find that both indoor and outdoor workers are less productive in warm temperatures (Engineering News Record 2008). Yet, the magnitudes of the regression coefficients here in
times of modern indoor climate control raise concerns about their validity. Finally, the small but
significant positive effect of latitude on productivity evokes findings in Hall and Jones (1999) that
social capital is higher in northern areas, even within the United States.
The coefficients of determination reveal that this parsimonious set of amenities explain 88 percent of trade-productivity, and over 90 percent of land rents and total amenity value. Population,
education, sunshine, coastal proximity, average slope and mild temperatures are all strongly associated with overall amenity value. The results also imply that households are taxed for living in
cities that are large, flat, cool, coastal, and educated.

Conclusion

The above analysis goes far beyond existing work to improve our understanding of how the relationship between prices and amenities depends on factor shares, wage multipliers, and federal
taxes. It also helps researchers recover those values from available data sources, while understanding how data limitations may influence their results. Land values are necessary for determining
the total value of local amenities, especially in non-traded production. However, land values are
not entirely sufficient because of federal taxes. Fortunately, wage and housing-cost data alone
appear to be largely adequate for inferring local levels of productivity in tradables: the proposed

25

measure improves on wage-alone measures by capturing land inputs and accounting for potentially
confouding effects due to wage and tax multipliers. The resulting city rankings appear largely sensible. Statistically, it appears that local labor demand factors are more important in determining
local wages and housing costs than supply factors. Furthermore, a limited number of variables
explain over seven-eights of the variation in wages, trade-productivity and total amenity value.
This results presented here should be of use to future researchers. As already alluded to,
the framework may be used to infer local housing productivity with land-rent data (Albouy and
Ehrlich, 2012), or provide a starting point for understanding differences in population density (Albouy and Stuart, 2013). Extensions of the model with local production could do more with internal
structure, population heterogeneity, and dynamics. Nevertheless, understand what may be inferred
from basic cross-sectional variation in housing costs and wages, should be a useful stepping stone
towards more complex models and richer data.

federal taxes. Additionally, Panel A forces λ N=1 by setting sy = 0.108, φ N=0, φ L=1 ,and θ N=
0.842, making it a reduced model somewhat different than the Beeson and Eberts (1989)
parameterization in Table 1. Panel C accounts for federal taxes on wages only. Panel D also
includes housing deductions and state taxes, as explained in the Appendix.

standard deviations
Wage and housing price data are taken from the U.S. Census 2000 IPUMS. Wage differentials are based on the average logarithm of hourly wages for fulltime workers ages 25 to 55. Housing-cost differentials are based on the average logarithm of rents and housing prices. Adjusted differentials are the cityfixed effects from individual level regressions on extended sets of worker and housing covariates. See Appendix C.1. for more details. The inferred landrent, quality-of-life, trade-productivity, and total-amenity variables are estimated from the equations in section 4.2, using the calibration in Table 1, with
additional adjustments for housing deductions and state taxes, described in Appendix A.

The tax multiplier now includes a second mechanism: higher prices lead to greater deductions,

Parameterization
Economic Parameter Choices

The parameterization used here is the same as in Albouy (2009), although I review it below. Because of accounting identities mentioned above, only six parameters are free, but choosing these
requires reconciling slightly conflicting sources.
Starting with income shares, Krueger (1999) makes the case that the labor share, sw is close
to 75 percent. In practice, this reflects the previous literature that weights the wage differential
by labor income, rather than household income. Albouy (2008) argues this number applies to a
representative household, so higher-income households, with more income from capital, receive
greater weight. It also averages in retirees and others on fixed or transfer income (e.g. students).
The share is also consistent with data in the Survey of Consumer Finances. Theoretically, the use

ii

o

of sw in (4a) implies that if a households moves, their wage may change, but not the flow income
from previous savings.
Poterba (1998) estimates that the share of income from corporate capital is 12 percent, and thus
income from mobile capital, sI should be higher, and is taken as 15 percent. This leaves 10 percent
for land sR . This is the same as in Shapiro (2006) and roughly consistent with estimates in Keiper
et al. (1961) and Case (2007).28
Turning to expenditure shares, Shapiro (2006), Albouy (2008), Moretti (2013) and find that
housing costs can also be used to approximate non-housing cost differences across cities. The
cost-of-living differential is sy p^j , where p^j is equal to the housing-cost differential and sy is the
expenditure share on housing plus an additional term to capture how a one-percent increase in
housing costs predicts a b = 0:26-percent increase in non-housing costs. In the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX), the share of income spent on shelter and utilities, shous , is 0.22, although
the share of income spent on other goods, soth , is 0.56, with the remaining 0.22 spent on taxes
or saved (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2002). Thus, the coefficient on housing costs is equal to
sy = shous + soth b = 0:22 + 0:56 0:26 = 36 percent. This leaves sx at 64 percent.29
I choose the cost-shares to be consistent with the expenditure and income shares above. I use a
value of 2.5 percent for L here. Beeson and Eberts (1989) use a value of 0.027, while Rappaport
(2008a, 2008b) uses a value of 0.016. Valentinyi and Herrendorff (2008) estimate the land share of
tradables at 4 percent, but their definition of tradables makes this an upper bound.
Following Carliner (2003) and Case (2007), I use a cost-share of land in home-goods, taken as
housing, L , at 23.3 percent: this is slightly above values reported in McDonald (1981), Roback
(1982), and Thorsnes (1997), in order to take into account for secular increase in land cost-shares
over time, seen in Davis and Palumbo (2007). Together the cost and expenditure shares imply
that sR is 10 percent, consistent with other income shares, and that L is 17 percent. This seems
reasonable as the remaining 83 percent of land for home goods includes all residential land, and
most land used for commerce, roads, and government.30
The one remaining choice determines the cost-shares of labor and capital in both production
sectors. As separate information on K and K is unavailable, I set both cost-shares of capital to
be equal at 15 percent to be consistent with sI . Accounting identities then determine that N is
82.5 percent, N is 62 percent, and N is 70.4 percent.
28

The values Keiper et al. (1961) reports were at a historical low: that total land value was found to be about 1.1
times GDP. A rate of return of 9 percent would justify using sR = 0:10: Case (2007), ignoring agriculture, estimates
the value of land to be $5.6 trillion in 2000 when personal income was $8.35 trillion, implying a smaller share.
29
Utility costs account for one fifth of shous , which means that without them this parameter would be roughly 0:18.
As shown below, taking out utility costs would be largely offset by larger differentials in housing costs, p^j .
30
These proportions are roughly consistent with other studies. In the base calibration of the model, 51 percent of
land is devoted to actual housing, 32 percent is for non-housing home goods, and 17 percent is for traded goods,
including those purchased by the federal government. Keiper et al. (1961) find that about 52.5 of land value is in
residential uses, a 22.9 percent in industry, 20.9 percent in agriculture. Case (2007), ignoring agriculture, finds that in
2000 residential real estate accounted for 76.6 percent of land value, while commercial real estate accounted for the
remaining 23.4 percent. Appendix D.2, there may be advantages to modeling housing and non-housing home goods,
separately, but there is little additional information on non-housing goods to calibrate this model better. My suspicion
is that non-housing home goods are less land-intensive and more labor-intensive than housing goods. Accounting for
this would likely lower the implied share of total income going to land.

B.2

Choice of Tax Parameters

The federal marginal tax rate on wage income is determined by adding together federal marginal
income tax rate and the effective marginal payroll tax rate. TAXSIM gives an average marginal
federal income tax rate of 25.1 percent in 2000. In 2000, Social Security (OASDI) and Medicare
(HI) tax rates were 12.4 and 2.9 percent on employer and employee combined. Estimates from
Boskin et al. (1987, table 4) show that the marginal benefit from future returns from OASDI taxes
is fairly low, generally no more than 50 percent, although only 85 percent of wage earnings are
subject to the OASDI cap. HI taxes emulate a pure tax (Congressional Budget Office 2005). These
facts suggest adding 37.5 percent of the Social Security tax and all of the Medicare tax to the
federal income tax rate, adding 8.2 percent. The employer-half of the payroll tax (4.1 percent)
has to be added to observed wage levels to produce gross wage levels. Overall, this puts an overall
federal tax rate, 0 , of 33.3-percent on gross wages, although only 29.2 percent on observed wages.
Determining the federal deduction level requires taking into account the fact that many households do not itemize deductions. According to the Statistics on Income, although only 33 percent
of tax returns itemize, they account for 67 percent of reported Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). Since
the income-weighted share is what matters, 67 percent is multiplied by the effective tax reduction
given in TAXSIM, in 2000 of 21.6 percent. Thus, on average these deductions reduce the effective
price of eligible goods by 14.5 percent. Since eligible goods only include housing, this deduction
applies to only 59 percent of home goods. Multiplying 14.5 percent by 59 percent, gives an effective price reduction of 8.6 percent for home goods. Divided by a federal tax rate of 33.3 percent,
this produces a federal deduction level of 25.7 percent.
State income tax rates from 2000 are taken from TAXSIM, which, per dollar, fall at an average
marginal rate of 4.5 percent. State sales tax data in 2000 are taken from the Tax Policy Center,
originally supplied by the Federation of Tax Administrators. The average state sales tax rate is 5.2
percent. Sales tax rates are reduced by 10 percent to accommodate untaxed goods and services
other than food or housing (Feenberg et al. 1997), and by another 8 percent in states that exempt
food. Overall state taxes raise the marginal tax rate on wage differences within-state by an average
of 5.9 percentage points, from zero points in Alaska to 8.8 points in Minnesota.
State-level deductions for housing expenditures, explicit in income taxes, and implicit in sales
taxes, should also be included. At the state level, deductions for income taxes are calculated in an
equivalent way using TAXSIM data. Furthermore, all housing expenditures are deducted from the
sales tax. Overall this produces an average effective deduction level of = 0:291:

Validity of First-Order Approximations

Technically, the first-order approximation works best in a Cobb-Douglas economy, where elasticities of substitution are one, productivity is not factor biased, and quality-of-life is not, similarly,
"consumption biased."
B.3.1

Quadratic Approximations

The inferred land rent from equation (5) comes from a first-order approximation around the national average. This poses a problem if the cost-shares of land or labor vary substantially across
cities due to variations in factor prices. I address this by taking a second-order approximation of
iv

equation (3) around the national average, and rearranging it to solve for the inaccuracy of the
first-order approximation:

is the (Allen-Uzawa) partial elasticity of substitution between labor and land, with other
partial elasticities similarly defined. The first term on the right-hand side captures the substitution
between labor and land, and the second, between capital - which has a constant price - and the
other two factors.
If A^jY = 0, then (A.2) may provide quadratic estimates of land-rent differentials, r^j ; in terms
of p^j and w^ j . If the elasticities of substitution are less than one, as is likely, then the cost-share
of land increases with land rents. Since the land-share effect depends inversely on the cost-share
of land, the quadratic approximation of r^j is concave in p^j , as the land-share effect decreases with
r^j . At the central point where p^j = w^ j = 0, the quadratic and linear approximations formulas are
tangent, and thus the concave quadratic approximation lies below the linear approximation, with
the difference increasing in the square of p^j . Therefore, the linear estimates overstate land-rent
differences for p^j > 0, and understate differences for p^j < 0. Additionally, the cost-share of
labor increases with w^ j and decreases with r^j , causing the need for additional adjustments for the
labor-cost effect.
Figure A1 graphs inferred land rents based on a second-order approximation, where YN L =
KL
= YN K = 0:67, against those already estimated off of the first-order approximation.(Appendix
Y
table A1 reports the numerical values)31 The estimates from the quadratic formula differ most from
the linear estimates where housing costs are furthest from zero. Yet, even at these extremes, they
differ by less than 20 percent.32
Another expression could be used for trade-productivity. However, we know little about the
substitutability between land and other inputs in traded-production. Many studies conclude that
the elasticity of substitiution between labor and capital overall is close to one.

estimate a value of "(1 0 );m = 0:1. Parameterized, the second-order adjustment replaces w^ j

identical to the original, with a correlation of over 0.999.
To consider this issue further, I use Census to data to calculate the ratio of wage and salary
income to total household income by metro area. The average ratio 0:78, and the standard deviation
is 0:034 when population weighted. A simple regression on the wage differential and the fraction
of the population over 65 (over65j ) explains 88-percent of the variation.

The coefficient on wages is positive, as predicted, but well below the predicted value of 0.25.
Measurement issues aside, this result may be reconciled with the model if moves across cities are
infrequent, and savings rates are uniform across cities. The underlying assumption that non-labor
income should not change when a household moves remains sensible. The coefficient on those
over 65 highlights the need to average in those outside of the labor force. Indeed, it would be
interesting to examine how cities with a greater fraction of retirees and others outisde of the labor
force have a smaller traded sector relative to the home sector. Using the actual shares to estimate
^ j still results in very similar estimates, with a correlation coefficient of 0.999.

Data and Estimation
Wages and Housing-Cost Differentials

Wage and housing-price data come from the United States Census data from the 2000 Integrated
Public-Use Microdata Series (IPUMS), from Ruggles et al. (2004).
To estimate inter-urban wage differentials, w^ j , I use the logarithm of hourly wages from fulltime workers, ages 25 to 55. These differentials should control for skill differences across workers
to provide an analogue to the representative worker in the model and isolate the effect of a city on
j
a worker’s wage. Thus, I regress log wages on city-indicators ( jw ) and on extensive controls (Xwi

Identifying these differentials requires that workers do not sort across cities according to their
unobserved skills. 34 An overstated wage differential for a city biases trade-productivity upwards
and quality of life downwards. Below is a list of the controls used in the wage equation:
12 indicators of educational attainment;
34

This assumption may not hold completely, but as argued in Albouy (2008), sorting may be less of an issue
than commonly presumed for three major reasons. First, the variance in wages across metros in observable skills is
relatively small. Second, different types of labor, according to education, are paid remarkably similar premia across
cities. Third, dropping individuals that currently reside in a metropolitan area away from their state of birth changes
the wage differentials by very little.

a quartic in potential experience, and potential experience interacted with years of education;
9 indicators of industry at the one-digit level (1950 classification);
9 indicators of employment at the one-digit level (1950 classification);
4 indicators of marital status (married, divorced, widowed, separated);
an indicator for veteran status, and veteran status interacted with age;
5 indicators of minority status (Black, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, and other);
an indicator of immigrant status, years since immigration, and immigrant status interacted
with black, Hispanic, Asian, and other; and
2 indicators for English proficiency (none or poor).
All covariates are interacted with gender.
I first run the regression using census-person weights. From the regressions, I calculate a
predicted wage is using the individual characteristics, not the MSAs, to form a new weight equal to
the predicted wage multiplied by the census-person weight. Economically, these income-adjusted
weights are more relevant since workers’ influence on prices is determined by their endowment
and income share (see Section D.1 below). The new weights are then used in a second regression,
which is used to calculate the city-wage differentials from the MSA indicator variables. In practice,
this weighting procedure has only a small effect on the estimated wage differentials.
To estimate housing-cost, p^j , I use both housing values and gross rents, with utilities, to calculate a flow cost. Following previous studies, I calculate comparable imputed rents for owned
units by multiplying reported housing values by a rate of 7.85 percent (Peiser and Smith 1985) and
adding this to utility costs.35 To avoid measurement error from imperfect recall or rent control, the
sample includes only units that were acquired in the last ten years. I then regress housing costs on
j
j
j
j
flexible controls (Xpi
) – interacted with renter-status – in the equation ln pji = Xpi
p + p + "pi ,
and use the estimates of jp for the housing-cost differentials. Proper identification of housing-cost
differences requires that average unobserved housing quality does not vary systematically across
cities. An overstated housing-cost differential biases both trade-productivity and quality of life
upwards.36 Below is a list of the controls used in the housing-cost regression:
9 indicators for number of units in structure (1-family home, attached; 1-family house, detached; 2-family building; 3-4 family building; 5-9 family building, 10-19 family building;
20-49 family building; 50+ family building; mobile home or trailer);
35

Based on an analysis of owner-occupied units, it appears that housing-cost differentials would be, on average, 20
percent larger if utility costs are excluded. In the mobility condition, this would be largely offset by using a value of
sy to exclude utilities that would be 20 percent smaller. In the housing-cost equation, it would suggest that including
utilities should require using a smaller value of L since utilities are likely to be less land-intensive than housing.
However, the value of L already appears to be somewhat low relative to recent studies.
36
This issue may not be grave as Malpezzi et al. (1998) determine that housing-cost indices derived from the Census
in this way perform as well or better than most other indices.

vii

9 indicators for the number of rooms, 5 indicators for the number of bedrooms, number
of rooms interacted with number of bedrooms, and the number of household members per
room;
2 indicators for lot size;
7 indicators for when the building was built;
2 indicators for complete plumbing and kitchen facilities;
an indicator for commercial use; and
an indicator for condominium status (owned units only).
All of these variables are interacted with tenure, i.e. renter status. Therefore the owner-occupied
user-cost rate of 7.85 percent only matters in how it used to incorporate utility costs.
I first run a regression of housing values on housing characteristics and MSA indicator variables
using only owner-occupied units, weighting by census-housing weights. From this regression, I
calculate a new value-adjusted weight by multiplying the census-housing weights by the predicted
value from this first regression using housing characteristics alone. Economically, these weights
reflect the number of efficiency units of housing that observation provides. I then run a second
regression with these new weights for all units, rented and owner-occupied, on the housing characteristics fully interacted with tenure, along with the MSA indicators, which are not interacted.
I take the house-price differentials from the MSA indicator variables in this second regression.
As with the wage differentials, this adjusted weighting method has only a small impact on the
measured price differentials.

and Xpi p , where Xwi and Xpi are the characteristic averages by metro, are plotted in Figure A1
using the same scale as in Figure 1. These estimates suggest that observable differences in worker

that, one may infer that unobservable differences in worker and housing quality may also be small.

C.2

Adjustment for Heterogeneity in Housing User Costs

For owner-occupied housing units, the above methodology uses the same user-cost rate across
cities. User costs may vary locally, however, due to several factors. To account for this, for these
differences, I apply the user-cost formula as formulated by Poterba and Sinai (2008). For itemizers,
this user cost is given by
U C = [1

(

D

+

Y (1

))] rT + (1

Y)

D

(rM

rT ) + d + (1

k)

p

where rT is the risk-free interest rate, rM is the mortgage interest rate, is a housing-specific
risk premium, d are maintenance and depreciation costs, is the capital gain, Y is the marginal
income tax rate applied to investment income, is the share of the home financed with debt, D
is the marginal income tax rate applying to deductions, p is the property tax rate, and k is the
fraction of property taxes "refunded" in the form of local benefits.
My parameterization follows that of Poterba and Sinai (2008), making as many adjustments as
possible to handle local heterogeneity.
viii

Capital gains . Capital gains reduce the user cost of housing. Because capital gains can
vary substantially across areas, this is potentially the most important adjustment, and also
the most challenging to incorporate them in practice. For instance, it is not completely clear
whether to use to use actualized or expected gains, and how to account for mean reversion. A
common practice is to use long averages: I do so for regional housing price changes. Using
Census and American Community Survey (ACS) data, I geocoded a comparable geography
of metro areas, and calculated housing-price differentials for 1980 and 2010 (whereb 2010
is actually the ACS from 2007-11), using the methodology described in section C.1. The
annualize relative price changes over this 30-year period exhibit a standard deviation of 0.9
percent.37 To these I add a national (real) growth rate of 1 percent, based on relative housingcost appreciaiton reported in the the BEA.
Local differences in mortgage rates rM : I take mortgage rates by state from in the from
the Federal Housing Finance Agency. These are converted into real interest rates using an
inflation rate of 2.5 percent. The average effective rate was 5.5 percent, with a standard
deviation of 0.3 percent.
Marginal income tax rate applied to investment income: Y is the combined rate from
federal and state taxes, provided by TAXSIM. The federal rate alone is 23.8 percent, and the
state tax rates averages 4.4 percent, with a standard deviation of 2.4 percent.
Marginal income tax rate applied to deductions: D is the combined rate from federal and
state taxes, provided by TAXSIM. The federal rate alone is 19.9 percent. The state average
is only 1.6 percent, with a standard deviation of 2.6 percent.
Local property tax rate P . There are no excellent national sources of this data, and so
I follow the common standard of taking the ratio of property tax payments to the reported
value of housing in the Census. The average of this number is 0.55 percent with a standard
deviation of 0.25 percent. These costs need to be discounted because property taxes are
partly a benefit tax making them fees for local public services. This is accounted for by
setting k = 0:25.
Risk premium : Lacking regional data on variation in the risk premium, I take the standard
value of 2 percent.
The opportunity cost of funds rT is taken as constant at 4:5 percent.
Maintenance and depreciation.d. To my knowledge, no one has has estimated regional
differences in these numbers. For now I use a standard value of 2.5 percent everywhere.
Fraction of mortgage financed by debt, .Following national averages, the loan-to-value
ratio is taken at 52.4 percent for itemizers and 32.4 percent for non-itemizers.
Fraction itemizing returns Among home owners I account for state level differences in
itemization rates based on the IRS Statitics On Income (SOI), For consistency, accounted
37

Using shorter averages would lead to somewhat larger variation, but it seems like this would be less accurate, and
still not make a very important difference in the final user-cost numbers.

ix

for the fact that as itemizers have a much higher share of income, and so I renormalized the
values to have a mean value of 0.67. The mean user cost for itemizers I get is 6.84 percent,
with a standard deviation of 0.9 percent. For non-itemizers, the user-cost formula produces a
higher number of 8.18 percent with a standard deviation of 0.97 percent. Across both groups,
the mean rate is 7.32 percent.
Fraction renting These user cost-differences apply only to homeowners. I was able to account for local differences accounting for the fraction of households who rent. he average
number of home-owners I had in the sample is 68.7 percent, with a standard deviation of 8.1
percent. The average is a bit high, as renters from group quarters and other such arrangements are dropped from the sample.
The difference between the original housing-cost indices and those that are locally adjusted
is illustrated in Figure A3. Except at the lower end, adjusting for regional differences in user
costs makes little difference: the correlation coefficient is 0.993 between the original and adjusted
differentials.

Amenity Data

All climate and geographic data are calculated at the public-use microdata area (PUMA) and averaged up to the metropolitan level, weighted by population. Population density is measured at the
census tract level, and also population-averaged.
Heating and cooling degree days (Annual) Degree day data are used to estimate amounts of energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperature levels. Daily values are computed
from each days mean temperature (max + min/2). Daily heating degree days are equal to
maxf0; 65 meantempg and daily cooling degree days are maxf0; meantemp 65g. Annual degree days are the sum of daily degree days over the year. The data here refer to
averages from 1970 to 2000 (National Climactic Data Center 2008).
Sunshine Average percentage of possible. The total time that sunshine reaches the surface of the
earth is expressed as the percentage of the maximum amount possible from sunrise to sunset
with clear sky conditions. (National Climactic Data Center 2008).
Average slope (percent) The average slope of the land in the metropolitan area. Coded by author
using GSI software.
Coastal proximity Equal to one over the distance in miles to the nearest coastline. Coded by
author using GSI software.
Violent crimes (per capita) These consist of the average of the four z-scores (standard deviations)
for aggravated assaults, robbery, forcible rape, and murder (City and County Data Book
2000).
Property crimes (per capita) These consist of the average of the four z-scores (standard deviations) for aggravated burglary, larceny, motor theft, and arson (City and County Data 2000)

x

Air quality index (Median) An AQI value is calculated for each pollutant in an area (groundlevel ozone, particle pollution, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide). The
highest AQI value for the individual pollutants is the AQI value for that day. An AQI over
300 is considered hazardous; under 50, good; values in between correspond to moderate,
unhealthy, and very unhealthy (Environmental Protection Agency, 2008).
Bars and restaurants Number of establishments classified as eating and drinking places (NAICS
722) in County Business Patterns 2000.
Arts and Culture Index from Places Rated Almanac (Savageau 1999). Based on a ranking of
cities, it ranges from 100 (New York, NY) to 0 (Houma, LA).

D.1

Multiple Household Types

For simplicity, ignore federal taxes and assume there are two types of fully mobile households,
referred to as "a" and "b." The most interesting case is when some members of each type live in
every city. The mobility conditions for each type are
ea (p; wa ; u; Qa ) = 0
eb (p; wb ; u; Qb ) = 0
I generalize the two zero-profit conditions with unit-cost functions that have factor-specific productivity components.
cX (wa =AXa ; wb =AXb ; r=AXL ; {=AXL ) = 1
cY (wa =AY a ; wb =AY b ; r=AY L ; {=AY K ) = p
The terms AXa and AXb give the relative productivity of each worker type in the city. Loglinearizing these equations:
^a
swa w^a = Q
^b
syb p^ swb w^b = Q
^a + N b w^b + L r^ = A^X
N aw
sya p^

= A^Y

where denotes the cost-shares of each factor, and a A^Xa + b A^Xb + L A^XL + K A^XK A^X and
^
^
^
^
A^Y . The additivity of these effects proves that differences
a A Y a + b AY b + L A Y L + K AY K
in productivity have the same first-order effects on prices regardless of the factor they augment
directly when weighted by the cost-share of that factor.38
38
L

This is more general than the models seen in Roback (1988) and Beeson (1991), who assume swa = swb = 1 and
= 1.

xi

Let the share of total income accruing to type a worker be a = Na ma = (Na ma + Nb mb ),
with the other share b = 1
a , and define the following income-weighted averages

Except for the terms in square brackets, "[]", these terms are otherwise identical to equations (7)
without taxes. The bracketed term explains that wage and housing-cost differences increase in the
quality-of-life of the labor type that is relatively more represented in the traded-good sector, or
decreasing in the quality-of-life of the labor type more represented in the home-good sector. The
wage of a-types resembles the average wage except that it is lower in places a-types prefer relative
to b-types.

The model assumes that both types of households live in each city. This assumption is easier to
maintain if the type of labor they supply are imperfect substitutes in production.
Factor-specific productivity differences do have first-order effects on quantities in the model.
For example, in the case where partial elasticities of substitution across factors within sectors are
equal, the relative employment of a-types relative to b-types is

Multiple Home Goods

Suppose now that there is one type of household but two types of goods, 1 and 2, e.g., housing
versus local services. Beeson and Eberts (1989) consider this situation but do not solve for it

completely. The four equilibrium conditions, using obvious definitions, are written
e(p1 ; p2 ; u)=Q = m
cX (w; r; {)=AX = 1
cY 1 (w; r; {)=AY 1 = p1
cY 2 (w; r; {)=AY 2 = p2
Log-linearizing these equations produces

Now a question is whether using a local price index based on only one home-good price, e.g. the
one for residential housing, p^1 , may be biased relative to using a more balanced local price index,

If the cost structure of both home goods are the same, i.e., if L1 = L and N 1 = N , then this
collapses to (sy sy1 )A^Y 1 , i.e., the price index is only biased up in cities relatively productive
in the first home good. When the first home good is more land intensive and less labor intensive
than the second, i.e. if L1 > L and N 1 < N 2 then an index based on the first home good will
^
more strongly capitalize differences in A^X . In this case, the first good capitalizes differences in Q;
A^Y 1 , and A^Y 2 more strongly when (1= L 1) ( L1 = L 1) > (1= N 1) ( N 1 = N 1). This
condition is expected to hold as L is probably much smaller than N . In the extreme case, where
the second good has the same factor proportions as the traded good, i.e., L2 = L and N 2 = N ,
p^2 = A^X A^Y 2 , its price only capitalizes differences in its own productivity. Most capitalization
occurs in the first good.
The distinction between home goods and traded goods is somewhat artificial, as most goods
are a mixture of both. The key distinction being how land and labor-intensive the goods are. The
broader the definition of home goods, the larger is the effective share sy , but the closer the cost
shares L and N are to L and N . The capitalization effects on land are unchanged so long as
sR remains the same. The capitalization of Q and AY will also be the same, so long as the ratio
L = N remains constant. The only substantial change are for AX in wages and prices: as the
definition of home goods expands, (1
L )= N gets larger, increasing the capitalization of AX .
