His and Hers: Gender Differences in
Work and Income, 1959—1979

ABSTRACT

This paper describes changes in hours of work and income between

1959 and 1979 of women and men ages 25-64. It includes attempts to
measure and value nonmarket production and leisure as well as market work,
to take account of possible income-sharing within households, and to

allow for economies of scale in household production. The most important
empirical result is that, relative to men, women's access to goods and

services and leisure was lower in 1979 than in 1959. Changes in hourly
earnings, hours of work, and household structure contributed to this

result. The sex differential in hourly earnings is explored in detail.

In mythical stories, it seems,
there were two ways to disaster.
One of the ways was to answer an
unanswerable question. The other
was to fail to answer an answerable question.
——Williams, 19814

The past quarter century has witnessed extraordinary changes
in gender roles, relationships, and expectations. Better control
over fertility and the growth of service industries and

occupations contributed to a sharp rise in female employment. The
Equal Pay Act of' 1963 outlawed separate pay scales for men and

women performing similar jobs; Title VII of the Civil Rights Act
(19614) prohibited all forms of' discrimination in employment and

established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; and

Executive Orders in 1967 and 1969 prohibited sex discrimination
in employment by the federal government or by employers receiving
federal contracts and subcontracts.

Other factors affecting gender roles were also at work
during this period. Real earnings grew rapidly in the 1960s;
according to some economists, the growth of real earnings is a
major force pulling women into the labor force (Mincer, 1962).
Others believe that a sudden failure of real earnings to grow
(as in the 1970s) results in postponement of marriage and
childbearing and an increase in female labor force participation
(Easterlin, 1980). The expansion of government transfer programs
such as AFDC made it possible for some mothers to raise children
1

independently of support from the children's fathers. Finally,

many observers believe that the feminist movement raised women's
consciousness and led them to change their behavior with respect
to work and family (Friedan, 1963).
While the exact effects of these diverse factors are still

under dispute, there is no question that the two decades from
1960 to 1980 witnessed dramatic changes in U.S. labor markets and

in American families. Women's share of the labor force grew from
33 to L3 percent; the participation rate increased particularly
rapidly among married women with small children. The divorce rate
rose from 9.2 to 22.6 per thousand married women; the general
fertility rate fell from 118 to 68 births per thousand women

15414; and the proportion of babies born to unwed mothers jumped
from 5.3 to 18.k percent.

Did these structural and behavioral changes make women

better off relative to men? This seems to me to be an
unanswerable. question, and this paper does not court disaster

from that quarter. Other questions, however, such as what changes
have occurred in gender differences in hours of work, wage rates,
income, and household size and structure are, in principle,
answerable, and that is the major purpose of this paper. The
approach is comprehensive, including attempts to measure and

value nonmarket work and leisure as well as market work, to take
account of possible income sharing within households, and to
allow for economies of scale in household production. This paper
does not attempt to solve these difficult theoretical problems of
measurement, but the underlying assumptions and many intermediate

2

measures will be presented. The reader can, therefore, make

alternative estimates or can concentrate on those variables that
require fewer assumptions.
The focus is on men and women ages 25614, i.e., those adults

who are most likely to be in the labor market and most likely to
be responsible for children. Also, these are the ages when gender
role differences are likely to be greatest. Within constraints

imposed by space or sample size, results are reported separately

for blacks and whites" because both cross—section differences and
trends over time vary substantially by race; differentials across

age and schooling groups are also examined. Section I describes
major trends in various measures of work and income. Section II
presents a more detailed examination of a key variable, the sex
differential in hourly earnings. The paper concludes with a brief
discussion of gender—related issues of public policy.

I. Work and Income, 1959—1979
This section describes major trends in the work and income
of men and women ages 25—6)4 during the 1960s and 1970s. The

calculations are based on data in the 1/1000 samples of the
Censuses of Population of 1960 and 1980,21 supplemented by data
from the 1975—76 Time Allocation Study of the University of
Michigan Institute for Social Research. (The calculation of each
variable is described in the Appendix.) Hours of work data are
presented first; income data follow, and the section concludes

with several measures of "full income," i.e., an aggregation of
income and leisure.

Hours of. Work

Although both men and women work, the former devote most of
their working hours to the market while nonmarket work accounted
for almost two—thirds of women's work hours in 1979. It is,
therefore, necessary to examine both types of work in order to
make meaningful comparisons between the sexes.
iiarket hours.

Market hours of work for each individual are

estimated directly from the Census samples by multiplying hours
per week by weeks per year. This method may introduce error for
individuals because of differences between hours in the Census
week and average weekly hours in the previous year, but the
estimate for aggregates should be satisfactory. Total hours are
divided by the total number of individuals in the group,
regardless of work status, to obtain average hours.

Table 1 shows a very large increase in the market hours of
women relative to men between 1959 and 1979. This increase is
attributable primarily to a jump in the proportion of women

working in the market, from 3k to 52 percent and, secondarily, to
a decline in the proportion of men working in the market, from 87

to 82 percent (see Table 2). The relative number of hours worked
per worker did not change appreciably. The increase in percent
working was particularly large for married women and for women
ages 25—3k.
Nonmarket hours.

Nonmarket work is defined as hours spent

on housework (including yardwork), shopping, and childcare. This
information is not available in the Census, but is imputed to
each individual with the aid of reduced form regressions run on
data provided by the University of Michigan Institute for Social
Research. The data were taken from time diaries of 67k
individuals on four different days during the 12—month period

fall 1975 to fall 1976. Separate regressions for men and women
were run with minutes per week of nonmarket work as the dependent
variable and dummies for race, age, marital status, presence of
children under 5, part—time work, and full—time work as the
right—hand—side variables (see the Appendix).

The regression coefficients, transformed to annual hours,
are used to impute nonmarket hours for individuals in the 1/1000
Census samples cross—classified by the characteristics used in
the regressions. For example, a white married woman aged 2514k
who had a child under 5 years of age and who was not working in
the labor market was given 2,387 hours of nonmarket work per

5

year. A white women of the same age who was single, without a

small child, and working full—time in the market, was assigned
812 hours of nonmarket work.

The 1975—76 data probably provide a reasonable estimate for
1979. But what about 1959? Two estimates are presented. Under

assumption A the same number of hours was assigned in 1959 as in
1979 for any giien set of characteristics. This assumes that

changes in the nonmarket work of women relative to men between
1959 and 1979 were attributable only to changes in marital
status, presence of small children, participation in market work,
and other measured characteristics. Some observers, however,

believe that women's nonmarket hours declined relative to men's
even if characteristics are held constant (Juster, forthcoming;
Robinson, forthcoming). Table 1, therefore, provides an
alternative estimate based on the assumption (B) that the
nonmarket hours of women in 1959 were 10 percent higher than
those calculated under assumption A.
Under either assumption the women/men ratio of nonmarket
hours declined from 1959 to 1979, but the decline was, of course,
much larger under assumption B. The decline was slightly larger
for blacks than for whites because of the large increase in the
proportion of black women who were not married (see Table 2). The
larger decline for married compared with non—married persons is
attributable primarily to the rapid growth in female labor force
participation of married women and, secondarily, to a rapid
decline in the child/adult ratio for married women, while the
ratio for non—married women was actually increasing (see Table 2).

6

Total hours.

Total hours of work is the sum of market and

nonmarket hours. Two estimates are presented corresponding to the
two assumptions about nonmarket hours. Under either assumption
women were working more hours relative to men in 1979 than in
1959. This trend was stronger for married than nonmarried

persons, slightly stronger for blacks than for whites, and much
stronger at the youngest and oldest ages than for persons 35_514.

The increase in the ratio at ages 55—64 is attributable in large
part to a substantial decline in the percentage of men working in
the market.

Income

Income, viewed as a measure of access to goods and services,

is measured here in a variety of ways. The imputed value of
nonmarket production is added to money income to obtain the total

income of each woman and man. Total effecti income is estimated
from total income by taking account of the size and structure of
households under alternative assumptions about the sharing of
income within the household. All dollar figures for 1959 have
been inflated to 1979 dollars by the Consumer Price Index.

Money income. Money income is the pre—tax cash income
received by individuals from all sources, including labor and
nonlabor income and cash transfer payments.1' Table 3 shows a
striking increase in the average money income received by women
from $3,015 in 1959 to $6,227 in 1979, or, as a ratio to men's
money income, from .22 to .3'L. This increase in relative money

income is entirely the result of differential changes in market

7.

hours of work; average hourly earnings of' women relative to men

fell slightly between 1959 and 1979 (see Table 2). The results
for whites are similar to the overall results. For blacks,

however, an increase in women's hourly earnings relative to men's
contributed to a particularly large increase in the money income
ratio.

Nonmprlcet—income. Nonmarket hours of work are valued at the
individual's hourly earnings if the individual worked at least

500 hours per year in the market. Other individuals were assigned
an imputed wage based on the hourly earnings of individuals of'

the same sex, color, age, and education.1' Two estimates of
nonmarket income of women in 1959 are presented, corresponding to
the two assumptions (A and B) about nonmarket hours of work in
1959. Under either assumption nonmarket income of women relative
to men declined appreciably between 1959 and 1979.

Total income. The total income of each individual is the
sum of his or her money and nonmarket income. Under hours

assumption A the women/men ratio of total income rose from .587
to .623, but under assumption B there was a slight decline in
this ratio. Under either assumption the ratio rose appreciably
for blacks, primarily as a result of a sharp increase In the

hourly earnings of black women relative to black men.

Total effective income. More than 90 percent of women and
men ages 25614 live in households with other persons. Membership
in a multi—person household can affect an individual's access to
goods

and services in several ways. First, there are usually
households; thus the

economies

of scale realized in larger

effective

income resulting from any given amount of money and
8

nonmarket income tends to rise with household size (Lazear and
Michael, 1980). Second, if there are children in the household,
some income must be devoted to their care, thus reducing the

effective income available to the adults in that household.
Third, the adults in the household may, to a greater or lesser
extent, pool their income, thus increasing or decreasing the
effective income of' individuals relative to their own total
income.

To capture the effects of economies of scale and the
presence of children, the number of' "adult equivalents" for each

household is calculated in the following manner. The first adult
is given a weight of 1.0, the first child 0.', each additional
adult 0.8, and each additional child 0.3 (Lazear and Michael,
1983). To measure the effects of' income pooling, two sets of

estimates are calculated under alternative assumptions about
sharing. Under the "sharing" assumption, the total income (money
and nonmarket) of' all adults in the household5! is divided by the

number of adult equivalents in the household, and the resulting
figure assigned to each person in the household. Under the "no-.

sharing" assumption, the total effective income of each
individual is their own total income multiplied by the adult!
adult equivalent ratio in the household. This ratio simultaneously
reflects the gain in effective income resulting from economies of
scale and the loss in effective income attributable to the
presence of' children. For instance, assuming no sharing, an adult

in a household with two other adults and one child would have the
same effective income as if he or she lived alone.

9

As can be seen in Table 3, under the sharing assumption the
total effective income of women relative to men declined between
1959 and 1979, but under the no—sharing assumption it rose if one

uses hours assumption A, and declined under hours assumption B.
Under the sharing assumption black women experienced a loss in
total effective income relative to black men, but under the no—
sharing assumption they gained appreciably between 1959 and 1979.

Full Income

To summarize thus far: relative to men, women increased
their hours of work between 1959 and 1979 (Table 1). The increase
was substantial under assumption A, and small under assumption B.
Again relative to men, the total effective income of women fell
if income is shared (regardless of the hours assumption) and also

fell if there is no sharing under hours assumption B (Table 3).
It rose slightly for hours assumption A and no sharing, but not
by as much as the increase in hours of work. As a summary measure
of access to goods and services and leisure, it is useful to
combine the changes in hours of work and total effective Income.
Euil income is defined as total effective income plus the
value of leisure hours, which are set equal to total available

hours' minus total hours of work. Two methods of valuing leisure
hours are presented. The first assumes that the value is equal to
total effective income per total hour of work. Using this method
the women/men ratio for a married couple with full sharing and
equal total hours of work would be 1. That is, one would conclude
that the woman and the man had equal access to goods and services
and leisure. An alternative approach is to assume that the value
10

of leisure hours is equal to the wage rate of' the Individual

(either observed or imputed). The advantage of' this method is

that leisure hours are valued the same way as nonmarket hours of
work.

Although Table L shows that the assumptions about valuation
of leisure, sharing, and nonmarket hours of women in 1959 can
matter, the most striking conclusion is that the full income of

women relative to men L11 between 1959 and 1979 for eir

in the women/men ratio of full income was greater for

hours assumption A than for B, and greater if leisure hours are
valued at total effective income per hour of work than at the

wage rate. The choice of assumptions is particularly important in
assessing what happened to black women relative to black men; the
results range from a 16 percent decline to an 11 percent increase
in the full income ratio.

The principal factors that affect full income are wage
rates, hours of work, household size and structure, and, to a
small extent, nonlabor income. The role of wages and/or hours
varies considerably, depending upon the assumptions. Consider a
simple model which ignores the effects of nonlabor money income,
economies of scale, and presence of children. In such a model the
women/men ratio of full income Is determined solely by relative
wage rates for single persons. This is also true for married
persons if there is no sharing. For married persons with sharing,
the full income ratio is the inverse of the hours of work ratio
if leisure hours are valued at total effective income per total

11

hours of work.J If leisure hours are valued at the individual's
wage rate, then the women/men ratio of full income rises with an
increase in women's relative wage and falls with an iicrease in

women's relative hours of work.'
The effect of changes in household structure on full income
varies with the assumption about income pooling. In the sharing

models, the izomen/men ratio tendsto fall as the percent not
married increases, because fewer women are sharing in the higher
income of their husbands. Regardless of' sharing assumption, an

increase in the number of children being raised by not—married

women lowers the women/men full—income ratio. Between 1959 and
1979 the increases in percent not married and in female—headed
households with children were particularly large among blacks,
tending to offset the gains in hourly earnings made by black
women.

In summary, the women/men ratio of full income was lower in
1979 than in 1959 for many reasons, including changes in
household structure, an increase in women's market hours that was
not fully offset by a decline in their nonmarket hours, and a

decline in women's relative hourly earnings. The next section
considers the earnings differential in greater detail.

12

II. Hourly Earnings, 1959—1979
Trends in relative hourly earnings, both actual and
standardized for age and years of schooling, are shown in Table 5.

The average for any group is obtained by dividing total earnings
of the group by total hours worked. This shows the rate of
earnings for the average hour worked and is equivalent to an

average

of the hourly earnings of each individual in the group

weighted by hours worked. Standardization is accomplished by

calculating

earnings rates for 28 age—schooling cells. The wage

rates of men(women) are standardized on the hours of women(men)
and the mean of the two results is shown.-l-QJ

The diverse trends for whites and blacks are readily evident
in both the actual and standardized ratios. Black women achieved
major gains in relative earnings, partly through a massive shift
in occupational distribution. In 1960, 36 percent of employed

black women were working as domestic servants, but by 1980 the
proportion so employed had dropped to 5 percent.
Among whites there was considerable diversity in trend,
depending upon age and years of schooling. At ages 25—3'4 both the

actual and standardized women/men ratios rose, but the actual
ratio fell by 7 percentage points at ages '45—514 and 55—614 and

even the standarized ratio showed declines at those ages. When
whites are classified by years of schooling, all groups with 12
years or less show declines in the standardized ratio, while all

the higher education groups show increases.11' Overall, the
standardized ratio was virtually identical in 1979 and 1959.

13

Wife/husband ratios. In Table 5, as in all of the preceding
tables, men and women have been compared in the aggregate,
without regard to their relationship at the individual level.
Thus the results for "married" compare all married women with all

married men and show the average change. It is also of interest
to look at the earnings and income of wives relative to husbands
when the ratios are calculated separately for each couple. Table 6
presents such results, limiting the analysis to couples where

both spouses are white and in the age range 25-6t.
The trends in the wife/husband ratios are less favorable for

women than are the aggregate data. For the average (median)
couple in 1979 the wife's hourly earnings were 62 percent of her
husband's, down from 69 percent in 1959. This decline is not the
result of entry into the labor force of wives with relatively
less schooling. When couples are grouped according to the years
of schooling of the wife relative to her husband, we see that the:

median ratio declined between 1959 and 1979 within each group. We
also see in Table 6 that the ratio declinec at every age, albeit
less so for those couples where the wife was aged 25—3g.
Not only did the median wife/husband ratio of hourly

earnings decline, but there was also a decrease in the percentage
of couples where the wife's hourly earnings exceeded her
husband's. There was, to be sure, an inorease in the absoJjjt.

number of such couples between 1959 and 1979, but there was an
even larger increase in the number of two.earner couples where
the wife's hourly earnings were low relative to her husband's.
The trends in wife/husband ratio of total income were more
favorable to women than the trends in hourly earnings because
1L

wives increased their hours of work relative to their husbands.
Under assumption A about nonmarket hours of women in 1959, the
median total income ratio was unchanged at .533. Under hours

assumption B there was a decline from .580. Among couples with
wife aged 25_3L1 there was a substantial increase in the ratio

under assumption A and no change under assumption B. At that age

under either assumption there was a large increase in the
percentage of couples where the wife's total income exceeded her

husband's, primarily because the proportion of women working in
the market jumped from 27 to 56 percent.
In summary, among white couples, some wives were able to

increase their total income relative to their husbands' but this
was accomplished principally by working longer hours. The sharp
increase in market hours was not offset by a comparable decrease
in nonmarket work. The failure of hourly earnings of white women
to grow relative to white men is a major factor underlying many
of the trends discussed in this paper. Almost two decades of
anti—discrimination legislation, growing demand for female labor
in service industries and occupations, more reliable

contraception, and changes in social attitudes have apparently
had little effect on relative earnings. The explanation of this
stability is beyond the scope of this paper, but the next section
considers one possible line of analysis.

Number of chijdren. Some economists believe that the
apparent stability in the standardized hourly earnings ratio is
the result of an influx into market work of women whose earning
power was less than that of the women already at work (Smith and

15

Ward, 1983). The lower earning power of the new entrants could be
the result of less market experience, less aptitude and training
for market work, or other factors. The Census data do not contain
measures of these variables, but there is one variable available
that may serve as an imperfect proxy for others——the number of
children ever born. An increase in the number of children, for
instance, can lower the earnings of women through effects on

market experience and on the location and type of job chosen when
in the labor market, or can serve as an indicator of relatively

greater interest in family than in career.
When women are grouped by number of children ever born we
observe major differences in many labor market variables,

especially for whites (see Table 7).12' Women who have never had
any children are more likely to be in the labor market, and those
in the market work more market hours per year. Among white women
average hourly earnings systematically decline as number of
children increases.
This differential in earnings is explored in greater detail
in Table 8, which shows women/men ratios of hourly earnings for

each group of women. Earnings were standardized by dividing the
actual hourly earnings of the women in each group by "predictedt'

hourly earnings; the latter is the hourly earnings of men
weighted by the distribution of hours across age—schooling cells

of the women in the group." Because each group of women in any
row is being compared with the same men, comparisons within any
row show the relationship between standardized earnings and
number of children ever born.
To be sure, this relationship does not precisely measure the
16

effect of children on earnings for at least two reasons. On the
one hand the earnings of those women with many children may be
biased upwards because a smaller percentage are participating in
the labor market and we therefore observe only those women who
select themselves for market work. On the other hand, those women
who had many children may have done so because their potential
for earnings in the labor market was below average. Despite the
latter potential bias, it seems to me reasonable to infer that
children do substantially depress women's earnings and that this
effect lasts throughout the life cycle. It is noteworthy that the

relationship is present at ages 556L, when most mothers no
longer have any direct child—care resporisibilities..]V

On average, hourly earnings of women who have had three
children are about 12 percent lower than those of childless
women. While women's disproportionate responsibility for children
contributes to gender inequality in earnings, it is not the whole
story. Childless women (white) earned only 71 percent as much as
men in 1979, and even among those 25_3L1 and childless, the ratio
was only •75•J5./

The relationship between number of children and women's
earnings affects the 1959—1979 comparisons because the increase
in participation rate was greater for women with many children
(see Table 7). Although the average number of children ever born
to white women ages 25—64 was virtually the same in 1959 and 1979
(2.30 and 2.27, respectively), among those who were working the
average number of children rose from 1.70 to 1.97. At ages '5—54
the increase was particularly large among white working women,

17

from 1.79 to 2.76 children. At ages 2534, however, for white

working women the average number of children 1ined from 1.32
to 1.03, and the proportion with a child under six also declined,
from 35 percent to 29 percent.

It is possible to obtain a rough estimate of the effect on
earnings of the increase in the number of children of working
women by recalculating an average standardized earnings ratio for
1979 using the 1959 distribution of working women by number of
children born. This recalculation provides a little support for
the adverse selection explanation. It raises the 1979 ratio by
about one percentage point overall and by two percentage points
at ages 45—54. The ratio at ages 25—34, however, is lowered
slightly by this adjustment because of the shift at that age

toward working women with fewer children.
The argument that rising participation rates among women
lowers observed earnings because of adverse selection is not
limited to the matter of entry by women who had more children.
If, holding number of children constant, the percent working

rises from say 30 to 40 percent, it is certainly possible that
the additional entrants earn less than the ones who were already
at work, thus pulling down the overall average.
Changes in percent working varied considerably across groups
of women defined by birth cohort and number of children ever

born, as may be seen in Table 9th' In some instances the
percentage increased by one—fourth or more in a decade while in
others the proportion actually declined as the cohort aged. If
the increase in percent working signals the influx of workers
whose earnings are substantially below that of those already at
18

work, we should, ceteris paribus, observe a negative relation
between changes in earnings and changes in percent working across
groups of women. Table 9 shows the standardized earnings ratios
and Figure 1 presents a scatter diagram of changes in both
variables. The ratio of the percent of women working in

1969(1979) to the percent in 1959(1969) is measured on the
horizontal axis, while the standardized earnings ratio in
1969(1979) divided by the ratio in 1959(1969) is measured on the
vertical axis. Changes over each decade at each age are easily
identified.

Inspection of Table 9 and Figure 1 reveals that the percent
of women working tends to rise from ages 3514k to 5_514 while the

women/men earnings ratio tends to fall. Between ages k5_51 and
55_6L the percentage working tends to fall and the earnings ratio
to rise. Thus there is a simple negative correlation. More
importantly, however, within each age transition (the solid marks
for 35—'L to LI551 and the open marks for '45—5'I to 55—6I) the

correlation between the two variables tends to be positi.
These relationships can be seen more clearly with the aid of
a few simple regressions whose results are reported in Table 10.
When the change in the standardized earnings ratio (in SE2/SE1)
is regressed on the change in the percent of women working
(iWPCTWK) alone, the coefficient is negative but the t value is
only .72. The addition of dummy variables for the decade of
change (DUMYR) and the stage of life—cycle (DUMAGE) makes the
coefficient o,n AWPCTWK positive, albeit not significantly so. The

age dummy is significant, as expected.

19

The third regression in Table 10 has as its dependent
variable the change in women's earnings (in WE2IWE1) and the
right—hand—side variables repeat the second regression. The

coefficient for change in percent working is again positive, but
not significant. The year dummy is very significant, reflecting
the relative stability of earnings in the 1970s compared with

rapid growth in the 1960s. These regressions represent only one
limited experiment, but they certainly do not support the view
that the increase in the percent of women working depressed

women's earnings through adverse selection.

Policy Implicatioiis

The most important empirical finding in this paper is that
women's access to goods and services and leisure, relative to
men's, was lower in 1979 than in 1959. The extent of the decrease
varies with assumptions about the valuation of leisure hours, the

extent of income sharing within households, and estimates of
women's nonmarket hours in 1959. Some decrease, however, is
evident under every combination of assumptions.

This result cannot be automatically translated into a
conclusion that women were "worse off" in 1979 than in 1959
relative to men. The full income measure used in this paper is
far from a complete measure of utility. Women may, for instance,
have gained independence and autonomy during those two decades,
and these gains may have been worth more to them than the loss of
some goods and services or leisure. Alternatively, it is possible
that the decline in relative full income was

offset by other

aspects of utility. Robert Willis, for instance, has suggested
that a decrease in men's demand for marriage and children (i.e.,
for the type of work women traditionally specialized in) has
adversely affected women's relative economic position.lL'
Some observers believe that the women/men ratio of hourly
earnings has been temporarily depressed as a result of an influx
of women into the labor force who have below average work
experience and aptitude. James Smith and Michael Ward (1983), for
instance, write: "The late 1970s suggest that these sample
composition effects which have camouflaged reality for some time
have basically run their course. We expect that the story on
21

female wages during the next two decades will be far different
than what has occurred to date. For the remainder of this

century, we predict that female wages will rise much faster than
those of males. The initial hints of this emerging trend have
already occurred during the last half of' the 1970s." They

presumably believe that there is no need for public policy
interventions.

Other observers interpret the data in a radically different
fashion. They see little change in gender segregation by
occupation, no increase in earnings relative to men, and they
note that the fragmentation of families places additional
economic burdens on women. They advocate major changes in the way

wages are determined, favor affirmative action programs that come
close to setting employment quotas, and urge large increases in

paid maternity leave, day care services, and other subsidies for
women.

Still another possible view is that the decline in women's
relative full income is the result of social and legislative

policies designed to reduce the differences between men and

women. Those holding this view believe that encouragementof
women to leave the home, to work in the market, and to raise
children independently of' men hurts them economically and has

adverse social consequences as well. They advocate a return to
the gender role differentiation characteristic of earlier
decades.

Some interpretations and policy recommendations fall between

these extremes. For instance, it is possible to believe that

22

market forces will eventually result in gender equality in
earnings but that the narrowing will take place very slowly. One
might, therefore, argue that current cohorts of women deserve
some additional assistance (Cain, 1983). Or, while still

believing in the capacity of the market to eliminate earnings
inequality, public policy questions may be raised with respect to
effects on fertility and childcare.
In order for women to earn as much as men in competitive
markets, they will probably have to behave like men with respect
to subjects studied in school, choice of jobs, post—school

investment, and commitment to career. This could result in
extremely low fertility or in large numbers of children receiving

inadequate care.11 A recent survey of women corporate executives,
for instance, reported that 52 percent were childless; of those
under age kO, almost two—thirds were childless (1La11 Street

Journal, 198k). In 1983 the U.S. general fertility rate dropped
to 65 per thousand women 15—k't. This may be only a temporary dip,

or it may be a harbinger of even lower fertility in the future.
Objective data concerning the care of children is difficult to
obtain, but widespread stories about "latch—key" children,
discipline problems in school, and high rates of drug addiction,
alcoholism, and suicide among teenagers provide some cause for
concern. Thus, even if one believes that women will eventually
achieve earnings equality with men without any public policy
interventions, there may be a case for policies that help women
indirectly by providing child allowances, day—care services, and
similar subsidies for children.
Although their relative "full income" may have declined,
23

women are gaining political power at a rapid rate. In 1980 there
were 10 percent more women than men voting; between 1975 and 1980
the number of women holding local and state offices more than
doubled, to 12 percent of the total, and in 198k a woman was

nominated by a major party for vice president of the United
States. It seems likely that there will be increasing pressure in
this country for policies that help women economically, i.e.,

that in effect transfer income from men to women.
The current

campaign for "equal pay

for work, of comparable

worth" is an example of a policy that would redistribute income
to

women. Most economists recoil with horror at the prospect that

wages for large groups of workers (perhaps eventually all
workers) would be set by extra—market processes. They are
concerned about the inflationary pressures generated by such a
policy, as well as the potential efficiency losses through
distortionary effects on the demand for labor, the supply of
labor, and the relative prices of goods and services. Most
feminists favor this policy, but at least one opposes it because
it would perpetuate gender role differentiation (Barrett, 1982).
If "equal pay for comparable worth" is an inefficient way to
help women, are there more efficient ways? And, are there
policies that will be equitable for women with major differences
in attitudes, preferences, and behavior. Those women who wish to
follow a traditional pattern of concentration on family with
secondary commitment to paid employment are likely to want
different laws and social institutions than will those women who
put primary emphasis on a market career. During the balance of

2

this century there are likely to be millions of women of each
type.

Public policies with the same goal (i.e., helping women) can
have very different social and economic effects. Some policies,
e.g., equal pay for comparable worth, paid leaves for childbirth
and infant care, would encourage more labor force participation
by women. Others, e.g., direct payment to mothers who stay home
and take care of their children, would encourage women to stay
out of the labor force. Some policies would have positive effects
on fertility; others the reverse. Depending on the method of
financing, some programs would discourage employers from hiring

women while others would not. In short, the transfer of income
to women can be pursued in a variety of' ways. Perhaps the

greatest challenge currently facing economists concerned with
labor markets and families is to try to understand the economic
and social consequences of alternative policies. The national

welfare may well depend more on
something is done.

regression coefficients to estimate wages for individuals. Two

women/men differentials in income were not significantly
affected.

51Nonmarket hours of work were estimated by regressions on
the time diary data for persons 18_214 and 65+ who were living in

households with adults 25—6k and the imputed value of their
nonmarket hours was included in total income. (See the Appendix.)

earnings growth than other women. In fact, between 1959 and 1979
29

their earnings tended to grow slightly more rapidly than the
earnings of women with more schooling, but the differential
growth by schooling was even greater among men so the women/men
ratio tended to decrease for the lower schooling groups. An
earlier study (Fuchs, 197'!) reported an increase of a few

percentage points in the standardized ratio between 1959 and
1969. That study included all ages but was limited to the nonfarm

population. These differences in coverage appear to account for
the different results reported in Table 5.
-121Part of this race difference in 1959 may be the result

of measurement error. In the 1960 Census never—married women were
assumed to have had zero children. This assumption was probably
less justified for blacks.

-1311t is the W/W term of footnote 10. The reverse
standardization, Wm/Wm was not done because of difficulty in
calculating hourly earnings for some of the age—schooling cells
for some groups of women.

1-"When women are young, the principal effect of children
on earnings is probably through the effort that must be devoted
to child care. When women are older, the principal effect is
probably through earlier lost opportunities for post—school
investment in human capital.

-'Expectations about children can still affect earnings,
even for childless women. On the supply side, expectations can
affect the subjects women study in school, the jobs they choose,
and so on. On the demand side, prospective employers may be less
willing to hire or to invest in a young woman (even though

APPENDIX: DESCRIPTION OF DATA AND VARIABLES
The basic data come from the 1/1000 Public Use Samples of
the 1960, 1970, and 1980 Censuses of Population. Military and

group—quarters individuals were excluded. All measures focus on
adults ages 25—64, but adults 18—214 and > 65 and children living

in households with persons 25—614 were included in those measures

that adjust for household.
The worker sample was restricted to individuals who worked

at least one week during the previous year, at least one hour
during the census week, and who reported nonzero earnings in the
previous year. There were 148,2914 workers in 1960, 55,1463 in 1970

and 69,702 in 1980.

The "married" sample was restricted to individuals who were
married with spouse present and who were either the head of the
household or the spouse of the head. All other individuals were
classified as "not married."
Non—market hours were estimated with the aid of time diary
data collected by the University of Michigan's Institute for
Social Research, "Time Use in Economic and Social Accounts, 1975—
76." A representative sample of the adult American population
reported their time use on four days during 1975—76; these were
weighted to form a synthetic week.

Description of Variables

1. Market hours of work——Hours worked in the market are
estimated by multiplying the number of weeks worked in the

32

previous year times the number of hours worked in the census

week. This product is constrained to a maximum of 3500 market
hours per year. Means are calculated for all individuals, not
just workers.

2. Nonmarket hours of work——The effect of individual
characteristics on hours of nonmarket work is estimated by
regressions on data from the Institute for Social Research Study,
ttTjme Use in Economic and Social Accounts, 1975_76.tT The results

for men and women ages 25_6L1 follow (t ratio in parentheses):

33

Annual hours of nonmarket work (minutes per week times 52/60)

are imputed for individuals in the census samples based on their
characteristics. Under assumption B for 1959, the estimates for
women are increased by 10 percent.
3.

Total hours of work——Market hours (1) + nonmarket hours

(2).

14. onev income——Money income from all sources in 1959,
1969, and 1979 as coded in the census samples. The maximum loss
an individual was allowed was $—10,000. Mid—points of income

classes were used and the open—ended class was given a value of
$32,500 in 1959, $60,000 in 1969, and $85,000 in 1979. All dollar
values for 1959 and 1969 were inflated to 1979 dollars by the CPI.

5. Nonmarket income——If an individual works 500 or more
hours per year in the market, nonmarket hours are valued at his
or her hourly earnings (total earnings divided by annual hours).
If an individual works fewer than 500 market hours, nonmarket
hours are valued at the average hourly earnings of all
individuals of the same sex, race, age and schooling.

6. Total income——Money income (14) + nonmarket income (5).

7. Total effectie income——Total income is adjusted for
household size and structure under two assumptions about the
pooling of money and nonmarket income within the household. Under

the "sharing" assumption, total effective income of each
individual in a household equals the sum of the total income of
all adults (ages 18÷) in the household divided by the number of
adult equivalents. The latter is calculated by counting the first
adult as 1, each other adult as .8, the first child (0—17) as .4

314

and each other child as .3. Under the "no sharing" assumption,
total effective income of' an individualequals his or her total

income multiplied by the ratio of number of adults to adult
equivalents.

Nonmarket hours are estimated for people ages 18—24 and 65÷
(N147 men; 54 women) by regressions of' data from "Time Use in

Economic and Social Accounts, 1975—76." An individual's nonmarket
hours are imputed based on sex, age, marital status and work
status. For those individuals 18_2L and over 65 working 500 or
more market hours, nonmarket hours are valued at own hourly
earnings rate. If the individual works fewer than 500 market
hours and is 182Ll years old, nonmarket hours are valued at the
average hourly earnings rate of all 18—24—year—olds of the same
sex, race, age and education. The rionmarket hours of 65—7k—year—

olds who work fewer than 500 market hours are valued at 80
percent of' the .average hourly earnings of 55—6k—year—olds of the

same sex, race, and education. For individuals ages 75 and over,
nonmarket hours are valued at 60 percent of this rate.

8. fjj1_income——Full income is the sum of total effective
income and leisure, with leisure hours valued at total effective
income per hour of' work or, alternatively, valued at the

individual's wage rate. Leisure hours are assumed to be equal to
5110 minus annual hours of work.
