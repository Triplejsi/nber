International Coordination in the Design
of Macroeconomic Policy Rules

ABSTRACT

The paper examines international issues that arise in the design

and evaluation of macroeconomic policy rules. It begins with a theoretical investigation of the effects of fiscal and monetary policy in a
two—country rational expectations model with staggered wage and price

setting and with perfect capital mobility. The results indicate that
with the appropriate choice of policies and with flexible exchange
rates, demand shocks need not give rise to international externalities

or coordination issues. Price shocks, however, do create an externality, and this is the focus of the empirical part of the paper. Using a
simple 7 country model —

consisting

of Canada, France, Germany, Italy,

Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States —

optimal

cooperative

and non—cooperative (Nash) policy rules to minimize the variance of

output and inflation in each country are calculated. The cooperative
policies are computed using standard dynamic stochastic programming
techniques and the non—cooperative policies are computed using an

algorithm developed by Finn Kydland. The central result is that the
cooperative policy rules for these countries are more accommodative to
inflation than the non—cooperative policy rules.

The purpose of this paper is to examine some of the
irternational

economic issues that arise in the design and

evaluation of macroeconomic policy rules. The focus is on the
seven industrialized countries that participate in the annual
summit meetings on economic policy——Cananda, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Although international macroeconomic policy coordination is one
of the main subjects at the summit meetings, there has been
little empirical research on how the policy rules in these seven
countries should in fact be coordinated.
The paper draws heavily on recent closed economy research,
in

which there has been

a considerable effort devoted to

designing and evaluating alternative policy rules.1

In

multicountry applications, however, the design and evaluation of

macroeconomic policy rules is considerably more difficult than

for a closed economy. Not only are the empirical models more
complicated, but also the issues of policy coordination and

cooperation must be faced when designing rules. Despite these
difficulties, such research would clearly be a useful component
of any attempt to construct a long—lasting macroeconomic policy
for the world economy.

It is certainly central to any discussion

of international monetary reform.
The paper begins with a summary of some theoretical

results on the effects of policy in an international economy with

rational expectations. Although, the rational expectations
1

assumption may not be appropriate in the period immediately after
a policy reform (when market participants are learning about the
policy), it does seem appropriate for estimating the longer—term

effects of a new policy. We use a two—country rational
expectations model with staggered wage and price setting;

expectations are assumed to be rational In all markets——labor
markets as well as financial markets..

"sticky" and "forward—looking."

Hence, wages are both

Monetary policy has an effect

on real output, though of a qualitatively different tpe than in
Keynesian models without rational expectations. The demand side
of the model is essentially a souped—up version of the Mundell—

Fleming ISLM model with perfect capital mobility. Using
representative parameter values we illustrate the domestic and
foreign effects of aggregate demand and supply (or price) shocks
in each country.

Although the specific two—country results are o-f interest

on their own right (models with capital mobility, staggered price
setting, and rational expectations have been difficult to analyze
until recently), the more general policy implications are
exploited in the rest of the paper.

Under the assumptions that

both monetary and fiscal policy instruments can be controlled
and that the timing of their effects is known, the two—country

model indicates that the effect of aggregate deand shocks on
real output and inflation can be offset by an appropriate
monetary and fiscal policy in each country without affecting

economic performance abroad. Hence, with an efficient choice of

2

policies, demand shocks need not give rise to any special
international externality or coordination issues under this set

of policy assumptions. On the other hand, supply shocks do
create an externality. In general even an efficient monetary
policy to deal with supply shocks in each country affects

macroeconomic performance in the other country.

Unlike the

case of demand shocks, this "supply—side" externality remains if
the policymakers have perfect control of the instruments.

The

policy implication of this supply—side externality is the main
subject of this paper.

In order to measure the quantitative importance of the

externality, an n—country model that simplifies the structure of

the Mundell—Fleming two—country model is developed. This model
is then applied to the seven large summit countries. Parameter
estimates for these countries are obtained, and optimal

cooperative and noncooperative (Cournot—Nash) policy rules to
minimize the fluctuations in real output and inflation are
calculated.

The calculation of these cooperative and

noncooperative policy rules for a group of countries can be
viewed as an international extension of a similar calculation
reported in Taylor (1979) for the United States as a closed

economy. The cooperative policy rules are calculated using
standard optimal control theory, and the noncooperative policy
rules are calculated using a control algorithm proposed by

Kydland (197). The main result is that the cooperative policy
rules are more accommodative to inflation than the noncooperative

Countries with Rational Expectations and Mobile Capital.

Table 1 displays the equations of the two country model.
The notation is defined in Table 2.

All the variables

except the interest rates and the inflation rates are measured as
logarithms., and all variables are deviations from means or

secular trends. For example, y is the deviation of the log of
real

GNP from secular or

potential GNP.

Equations (1) through

describe country 1; equations (8) through (13) describe
coLintry 2; an asterisk denotes the variables of country two;
(6)

equation (7) is the condition of perfect capital mobility:
the interest rate in country 1 is equal to the interest rate in

country 2 plus the expected rate of depreciation of the currency

of country 1. Because the structure in the two countries is the
same, we need describe only the equations in country 1.
Equation (1) is the

"contract" wage (x) equation.. A wage

decision is assumed to last for three years, with only 1/3 of
wages being negotiated in any one year.

The wage set at time t

depends on expectations of future wages paid to other workers,

expectations of prices, and expectations of future demand
conditions as proxied by the deviation of real GNP from trend.
Equation (2) defines the average wage in the economy as a whole.

Equation (3) is a markup pricing assumption: domestic goods
prices are a weighted average of wages and the prices of imported

inputs to production measured in domestic currency units. Note

that we do not explicitly model the difference between the

price

of domestically produced goods and the price of consumption
goods, due to imported final goods. This would give a further
linkage between foreign prices and domestic prices and wages.

However, the effects on inflation and output would be
observationally equivalent to the approach used here to model
price linkages.

Equations (4) and () are textbook IS and LM

curves respectively. The real interest rate differs from the
nominal interest rate according to the rationally expected
inflation rate as described in equation (6).

The

closed

economy as a frame

of -eference.

To give some perspective to the two country results we

first examine the effects of monetary and fiscal policy in
the closed economy described by equations (1) through (6) with

l, f0,

and g0. The other parameters are reported in Table 2.

The co—existence of rational expectations and forward—looking,
though sticky, prices gives rise to real interest rate
movements which are unlike traditional ISLM models.

To illustrate the properties of the model, we consider a

money shock, a fiscal shock, and a supply shock. The money
shock is a one percent unanticipated permanent increase in the
money supply, the fiscal shock a one percent unanticipated
permanent rightward shift in the IS curve (equation(4)), and the
supply shoc:: is an

unanticipated

temporary shock to the wage

equation (1). The results are shown in the time series charts in
5

Figures 1 and 2. The figures show the actual values of the
variables rather than their logarithms. The parameters are
chosen so that the time unit is about one year, though no attempt
has been made to model the dynamics of the aggregate demand side.

In Figure 1 the fiscal shock is denoted by a square and the money
shock is denoted by a circle.

If only a circle appears for

particular period, the effects of the money and fiscal shock are

the same for that period; No attempt has been made to scale the
shocks so as to give similar effects for monetary and fiscal
policy.

Monetary policy has an expected positive effect on output

which dies out as prices rise and reduce real money balances back
to where they were at the start. Note that the real interest
rate drops more than the nominal rate because of the increase in
expected inflation that occurs at the time of the monetary

stimulus. For this set of parameters the nominal interest rate
hardly drops at all; all the action of monetary policy shows up
in the real interest rate..

Fiscal policy creates a similar dynamic pattern for real

output and the price level. Note, however, that there is a
strong "crowding in" effect of fiscal policy in the short run as
the increase in the expectation of inflation causes a drop in the

real interest rate. Eventually the expected rate of inflation
declines and the real interest rate rises; in the long run
private spending is completely crowded out by government spending
as in any model with price adjustment.

Before discussing the supply shock simulations it is
necessary to digress on a technical point involving the effect of

inflation

a shift in the expected rate of

on the aggregate

demand curve. The aggregate demand curve is the negatively
sloped relationship between y and p obtained by substituting
equation (4) in to equation (s).

This

curve will generally shift

with the expected rate of inflation. For example, a monetary
policy rule which holds the money stock constant will result in a
leftward movement in the aggregate demand curve whenever there is

a decline in expected inflation. A lower expected rate of
inflation increases the demand for money. In order to offset
such a drop in aggregate demand the monetary authorities have to

increase the money supply. An efficient monetary policy rule
will generally have a term to reflect this money adjustment.
When expected inflation falls, the money supply is increased.

Such a policy and can be written as

m =

(14)

where

+

is the expected rate of inflation.

The parameter

measures how accomodative monetary policy is to price shocks; the
parameter

measures the money adjustment for expected

inf]atjon.' When

= —b this rule eliminates the expected

inflation rate from the aggregate demand curve. In the price
shock

simulations reported here we consider the case where O

and where =—b. and in each case we set c<=O.

Higher values of c

expected the shock results in a decline in real output.

If there

is no offset for expected inflation (=cD, then there is a large
drop in output in the third period as the expected rate of
inflation is sharply reduced.

If there is an offset to the

expectation of inflation (=—b) then there is a much smoother

response of output. Notes however, that the money supply is
first reduced and then increased quite sharply to offset the
decline in expected inflation.

To cour,t'ies bvith a flexible exchange rate.
The effects of monetary and fiscal shocks in the full two—
country model are shown in Figure 3 when the exchange rate is

flexible. For these simulations the parameters are

perfectly

assumed to be the same in both countries and are given in Table
2.

In all of these experiments the policy shock occurs in

country 1.
The

dynamic impacts in country 1 of

a

fiscal

shock are similar

to the closed economy case. The initial impact on real output is
only

slightly less than in the closed economy, and the effect

out at about the same rate. There is also an initial drop
in the real interest rate and this is the primary reason for the

rate stimulates investment. Note. that the long—run output effect

of the fiscal shock is slightly positive in country 1. This is
matched by an

equal negative long—run output effect

in country 2.

However, there is an initial positive output effect in country 2
as the real interest rate first declines before increasing and
crowding out

investment spending there. Fiscal policy definitely

has inflationary effects abroad.

The effect of an increase in the money supply in

country 1 is also much like in the closed economy. There is a
positive short—run effect on output that diminishes to zero over

time. Part of the monetary stimulus comes from a depreciation of
the exchange rate for country 1 and part comes from the decline
in real interest rates. There is no significant overshooting o-f

the exchange rate following the monetary impulse. Unlike in the
Mundell—Fleming model, however, the increase in the money supply

is not contractionary abroad. As noted in Carlozzi and Taylor
(1993) a monetary stimulus can have a positive effect abroad

because the price level is not fixed; the depreciation of the

country

1 currency reduces prices in country 2 and this reduces

real balances in that country. The real interest rate also
declines slightly in country 2.

The response of the two countries to a supply shock in

country 1 is shown in Figure 4. We assume that the money supply
in both countries responds to a supply shock as in equation (14)
with

and c<=O.

For comparison we report in Figure 5 the results from
similar experiments with fixed exchange rates. gain the shocks
occur in country 1. But now country 2 has the responsibility for
maintaining the fixed parity. With perfect capital mobility this
means that country 2 must give LL an independent monetary policy.
The money supply in country 2 must move around in order to keep
the exchange rate fixed.

The short—run output effects of fiscal policy with fixed
exchange rates are a bit weaker in country 1 compared

with the flexible exchange rate case. The output
effects abroad are strongly negative, even in the short run.

There is no short run decline in the real interest rate in

country 2 as there was when the exchange rate could adjust. In
fact the real exchange rate in country 2 oversroots its new

higher long—run equilibrium value. Note that in order to keep
the exchange rate fixed, country 2 must reduce its money supply.

This

means that its price level must eventually fall; in the

short run there is thus an expected deflation which raises the
10

real interest rate in country 2 for a time above the long—run
equilibrium.

Monetary policy has a slightly weaker effect on real
output in country 1 than in the flexible exchange rate case.

In

the long—run the output effect diminishes and the price level

rises by the same amount that the money supply increases. The

of

effect

this monetary policy on the other country is much

stronger than in the case of FlexibLe exchange rates. In order
to keep the exchange rate fixed,

the

monetary authority in country

2 must expand its money supply by the same amount as the money

increase in country 1. This has stimulative effects on real
output that duplicate the effects of money in country 1.

Figure 6 shows the response in the two countries to a

supply shock in country 1. Country 1 has the same monetary

policy rules as before (=O or =—b, and c<=O) while country 2
must dedicate its money supply to the fixed exchange rate.

Compared to the flexible exchange rate case, the fluctuations in
real output are smaller in the home country and somewhat larger
abroad.

2.4 Class of Policy Rules.
In the previous section we considered three types of
macroeconomic shocks:

(1) IS carve shocks which

could be due to

shifts in any of the behavioral components of total spending
including consumption, investment, or government, (2) LM curve

shocks which could be due to velocity as well as to money supply
errors, and (3)

supply shocks which

are simply unanticipated

changes in the price (or wage) setting process. As we saw, these
shocks cause both economies to move temporarily from their
equilibrium

of full employment and stable prices. The task of

macroeconomic policy is either to offset these shocks, or to keep

the

deviations from full employment and price stability as small

as possible.

Rather than calculate the most general type of policy
rules to deal with these shocks we will consider a somewhat

narrower but simpler set'of policy rules. We assume at the start
that the instruments of policy can be controlled without error,

the shocks are observable by policymakers, and that the
magnitude and timing of the effects of policy are known. These
that

are 1'textbook' assumptions, and though they can be questioned in

the real world, they are a good starting place for studying
policy coordination.

The policy rules that we consider for each country have
four

prescriptive components: (1) use fiscal policy——government

spending or taxes——to offset IS shocks (this might be called the

"stabilization" component of policy), (2)

use monetary policy to

offset velocity shocks by adjusting the money supply (this is the
12

"technical" component of monetary policy; it is already widely
followed in many countries), and (3) use monetary policy to set
the degree of accommodation to supply shocks——that is, to
determine how large a change in output will accompany a given
price shock (this is the "accommodation" component of policy).
The degree of accommodation is the central policy rule parameter
that

must be chosen in computing the best policy aLit of this

class of policies given a particular social welfare function..
Sinc:e this class of policy rules calls for- an independent
monetary policy in each country, it implies one further
prescription: (4) exchange rates are flexible.

The second component of this class of policy rules seems
least objectionable given the assumptions we have made about the
information and control possessed by policymakers.. Some would
argue that the first component gives up opportunities to mix
monetary and fiscal policy in order to influence the size of
investment relative to consumption.. (A compensating advantage

is discussed in the next paragraph). The third and fourth
components are perhaps most controversial; the main alternative
is to forego any choice about monetary accommodation in one of
the two countries (in the two country model) and let the money

supply be dedicated to controlling the exchange rate. Fiscal
policy could then have an additional role of cushioning the
economy temporarily from supply shocks in the country responsible
-for

pegging the exchange rate. Compared with pure monetary

ac:commodation, this would cause different interest rate movements
after

a supply shock. It would be useful to consider some of

these

alternatives in future research.

-

13

For this class of policy rules aggregate demand shocks (IS

or LM) to not have any external effects abroad at least for

type

the

of structure portrayed in the two country model. This would

not be true if monetary policy were used to stabilize the economy
in the case of IS shocks; monetary stabilization policy would
require fluctuations in interest rates and with perfect capital

mobility this would have effects abroad. The use of fiscal
policy to offset IS shocks does not require any movement in

interest rates. Similarly the use of fiscal policy to offset
velocity shocks would require
would

have foreign

fluctuations

in interest rates that

effects.

Supply shocks have external effects under this set of
policies except in the special case when they are fully

accommodated. A fully accommodated supply shock does not have
any effect on real output, and movements in the domestic price
level d not have any effects abroad because they are matched by

equal changes in the floating exchange rate. When a supply shock
is not fully accommodated there will be both real output effects
and price effects and these will have foreign repurcussions; this

was shown in the previous section. A flexible exchange rate
cannot isolate other countries from both output and price
movements abroad.
Note also that a policy that fixes the
exchange rate does avoid this problem; as was illustrated in the
previous
exchange

section, supply shocks have external effects

3. SimJe Empirical Framework for Computjnc Policy Rules.
In this section we develop an simple framework to compute
14

optimal cooperative and non—cooperative policies for

several

countries. Essentially we attempt to use a semi—reduced form

to describe the relation between inflation and output when
each country is following a policy rule of the type described
model

above.

In this way we make use of the fact that more complex

rules that require a full structural model to analyze are not
being used.

These are the "supply" shocks; in

general they are correlated between the countries (eg. world
Supply shocks), and in the empirical work below we use the actual
estimated correlation.

The price equations are meant to capture the interaction
between the two countries that would be expected when the
previously

described class of policy rules is being used. The

parameters are assumed to be positive. Here they

are the same in

each country. but this assumption will be dropped in the

empirical work

which •follows.

Inflation

in each country is

assumed to depend on its own lagged value——an indication of
expectations

of inflation as well as inertia

due to contracts.

Inflation in each country is also assumed to be positively
related to demand in the same country as measured by real output

relative to trend. Note that demand conditions in one country
have an influence on inflation in the other country. This
influence will be negative if exchange rates are flexible and
monetary policy is used to steer aggregate demand after a supply
shock, as is

(e., goes down), and

the

equivalent depreciation in

country 2 will tend to increase inflation in that country.

Hence, the direct positive effects of aggregate demand in country
1 will be augmented by the exchange rate movements and these same

movements will create a negative coefficient on aggregate demand
in the inflation equation in country 2.

(If exchange rates are

fixed or if fiscal policy is used to cushion supply shocks, then
this argument will no longer hold and

may be negative).

would be to replace the actual output variables on the right—hand
side with expectations of these variables——this approach was
taken in Taylor (1979).

Now consider the aggregate demand side of the model. The
policy rules described above will give rise the following types
of reduced form aggregate demand equations for the two countries:

y

(18)

y+ =

g7rt_z -

These equations represent the outcome of a particular policy for
adjusting the level of aggregate demand in response to inflation.

In writing (17) and (18) we are exploiting the first and second
components of the policy rules: that aggregate demand shocks are

perfectly offset without foreign repurcussions if aggregate
demand

shocks remained then disturbances would be added to

the equations,

and the correlation between these disturbances

would be affected by policy. The policy

parameters

in (17) and

(18) depend on how accommodative monetary policy is to supply
shocks.

Optimal Rules in the Stochastic Steady State.
The policy problem is to find values for the g—parameters
in (17) and (18) to maximize social welfare, This is a dynamic

problem: there are lags and we are interested in social welfare
for many periods.

practical way to deal with these dynamics is

17

to focus on macroeconomic performance in the stochastic steady

state. The stochastic equilibrium describes how the economy
reacts on average to shocks——the typical business cycle

fluctuations of outpJt and inflation. It also captures the
essential ways that policy can affect macroeconomic performance
by altering the size of the fluctuations of output and inflation.
The variance of output and inflation is a convenient measure of
the

size

of these business cycle fluctuations.

By +oc:ussing on the stochastic equilibrium we are

implicitly assuming an infinite time horizon for policy choice

with no discounting. This seems appropriate for macroeconomic
po].icy. We also are implicitly assuming that time inconsistency
will not be a problem: once a policy rule is chosen we assume
that it wi].l remain in Force with no attempt by the policymakers

to exploit

the past committments of

economic agents.

Using game theory terminology we implicitly assume that the

policymakers in each country are dominant players in a game with
the residents of that country, and that the solution to game is
time

consistent.

There is also a game between countries and

this is where the issue of coordination or cooperation arises.
We consider two alternative solutions to this multicountry game:

the cooperative solution which is motivated by positive economic
considerations, and the non—cooperative (Cournot—Nash) solution
which is motivated by normative or descriptive considerations.
An

alternative to the latter is to use a dominant player solution

for the international game with the U.S. being the dominant
p1 aycr.
To be specific consider the following welfare loss for each
country in the two country set—up:

1 or 2

The variances in (19) are the variances

of the steady -state stochastic equilibrium when the policy rules

in (17) and (18) are being used.

The optimal cooperative policy is easy to describe and
compute.

The two countries choose the g—parameters of the policy

in

(17) and (18) that minimize a weighted sum of (19) for i

rules

equal 1 and 2; determining which country gets the higher weight
on its loss function in this cooperative effort is a matter for

negotiation. We will assume that the weights are equal.
The non—cooperative (Cournot—Nash) optimal rules are

described as follows: country 1 minimizes its welfare loss
(19) in the steady state (for i=1) taking country Vs policy rule
(18) as given; similarly country 2 minimizes (19) in the steady

state (for i2) taking country l's policy rule (17) as given;
the Cournot—Nash equilibrium occurs when the rule that country 1

takes as given is optimal for country 2, and the rule that
country 2 takes as given is optimal for country 1.

In this two—

country symmetric model the non—cDoperative policy rules can

easily be computed by iterating each country's minimi:ation

rules

The policies are not only different in the accommodation to

dornstic inflation. Both sets of policies involve some reaction
to foreign inflationary developments; that is, g1 and g, are
not zero. The cooperative policies call for a stimulus to
20

aggregate demand when there is a rise in inflation in the other

country. This permits the other country to appreciate its
currency by a larger amount and helps to reduce inflation there.

The boost to aggregate demand at home is not considered a gain in
welfare, however, so that the "gain from trade" implicit in the
cooperative solution is in the form of an agreement for the other
country to help out in a similar way when the inflation situation
reverses.

The non—cooperative rule has the opposite response to

inflation in the other country. This occurs because without
cooperation there is a tendency for each country to counteract
some of the exchange rate effects caused by the policy in the

other country. For example, starting from a cooperative
equilibrium each country can improve its macro performance by
matching the policy of the other country; if one country
contracts in response to an inflation shock, the other country
can

reduce the inflationary consequences of the exchange rate

depreciation by similarly contracting. This means changing the

g coefficient from positive to negative. Of course, this
action will likely result in a change in the policy rule in the
other country, and eventually both countries are worse off than
they were in the cooperative mode.

in

the

last n columns. (These zeros are the weights on the

lagged demand terms in the policy rule which we know will be zero
in this problem but not in a general optimal control problem of

the form (22) and (23)).

Calculation of the cooperative equilibrium requires some

way of weighting the welfare functions in each country. We take
the weights to be equal. Then the optimal cooperative policy to
minimize loss in the steady state is given by the solution to

the value of the loss function evaluated at the optimal policies

this reason, the actual choice of policies is likely to depend on

the resulting welfare in Table 7. The policy rules were computed

A comparison of Tables 4 and 6 clearly indicates that the

cooperative policies are more accommodative to inflation than the
non—cooperative policies, much as in the symmetric two country

example. For all values of the loss function and for all
countries, the diagonal elements (i=j) are smaller in absolute

value in the cooperative case. Hence, an increase in domestic
inflation call for a smaller decline in output relative to trend

when countries

are cooperating in their choice of rules than when
28

they are in a

non—cooperative equilibrium.

The off—diagonal elements (i>j) or (i<J) are all negative in
the

nan—cooperative case: an increase in foreign inflation brings

about a decline in output

at

home for each country.

In the

cooperative case, however, the off—diagonal accommodation

The values of the loss function shown in Tables

indicate how welfare would change as a result of a shift from a

non—cooperative equilibrium to cooperation. The cooperative
policy rule minimizes the simple sum of the loss functions in

each country. Hence, it is not surprising that the sum of the

Summary and Conc 1 udi ni Remarks..

The ma:in objective of this paper has been to examine some

of the international issues that arise in designing macroeconomic

policy rules. A theoretical two country rational expectations
model was used to illustrate the effects of monetary and fiscal
policy in an international economy. In brief summary the
following effects were noted: A stimulative monetary policy has
positive real output effects abroad whether exchange rates are
fixed or flexible, though the foreign effects are much larger
with fixed rates. A stimulative fiscal policy has positve short—
run effects on output abroad when exchange rates are flexible and
negative effects when the exchange rate is fixed.. An

is in fact more accommodative regardless of the preferences in

MUCh recent macroeconomic research has been devoted to
developing techniques to evaluate the economic impact o-F

-

different policy rules on macroeconomic performance, primarily on
the business cycle and inflation. Lucas (1976) outlines the case
for looking at macroeconomic policy as a rule. Sargent (1984)
provides a more recent discussion and addresses some of the
reservations raised by Sims (1982). For some examples of
applications of the rules approach see Taylor (1979, 1980, 1982a)
It should be emphasized that one need not take a doctrinaire view
on the rules versus discretion approach to policy.
more
practical view is that there are some unique (non—recurrent)
macroeconomic events that require intelligent policy analysis and
that are not well—suited to a rule of the game approach, but that
in most business cycles there are many common recurrent features
that are best approached using policy rules.

2.

Econometric research on policy coordination is rapidly
expanding. The research related to that reported here can only be
briefly summarized: Taylor (1982b) examines optimal cooperative
policy rules in a mu].ticountry model with limited capital
mobility. Johnson (1982) considers non—cooperative (Nash) policy
rules in a similar 2 country model, building on the work of
Hamada (1974).
In Carlozzi and Taylor (1983) policy rules in a 2
country (symmetric) model with perfect capital mobility are
considered, Papeil (1984) has examined the effects of
alternative monetary accommodation rules in an empirical two
country model of the United States and Germany. A careful
theoretical examination of alternative solution concepts in two
country macro policy problems is presented Car-izoneri and Gray
1983). There are also several papers that consider optimal onetime paths (i.e. open loop) for the policy instruments. Sachs
(1983) uses a theoretical two country model to derive optimal
cooperative and noncooperative open loop paths for policy. More
recently Oudiz and Sachs (1984) have computed optimal cooperative
and noncooperative open loop paths for policy instruments in
Germany, Japan, and the U.S. using empirical econometric models
obtained by linearizing the Japanese Planning Agency's model and
the Federal Reserve Board's Multicountry Modal.

The results reported below on monetary

in the paper of

policy

with flexible

exchange rates in this model were previously reported in Carlozzi
and Taylor (1983).
The results on' fiscal policy with, flexible
exchange rates, and on monetary and fiscal policy with •fixed
exchange rates are reported in this paper for the •first time..
5.

The model is solved using the extended path algorithm
described in Fair and Taylor (1984). Since the model is linear
the extended path algorithm, which was designed for nonlinear
models, is too powerful and expensive. A more efficient
approach would be the iterative factorization algorithm desribed
in Dagli and Taylor (1983). The model could also be solve by
computing the roots e;plicitiy as in Blanchard and Kahn (1980),
though For the higher order models this might not he practical.
Note that if there are no demand shocks we can equivalently
write policy in terms of the real interest rate as r =
where c = h(1—o)/d with h=(a + bid)—1. This Interest rate
policy is in the form of a price rule.

7. See Shubik (1981) for a discussion of Cournot—Nash non—
cooperative equilibria. From a descriptive viewpoint it is not
clear that this is the best non—cooperative solution concept for
countries choosing macro policy rules. Moreover, if we imagine
the Cournot—Nash equilibrium solution being arrived at in
practice through an iterative process in real time, the process
would be implausibly slow for macro policy rules. Recall that
the "reaction functions" are in terms of the par'eeters of the
policy rules rather than in the actual policy instruments.
I originally intended to estimate the inflation equations for
all seven countries with the nine right—hand side variables
included without constraints, but the degrees of freedom became
I therefore considered an unconstrained
distressingly low.
estimation for only four of countries, but even then parameter
estimates appeared implausible for certain countries. Finally,
rather than reduce the number of countries I decided to
impose this plausible though somewhat arbitrary structure.
