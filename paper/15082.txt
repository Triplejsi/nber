What Do Emissions Markets Deliver and to Whom? Evidence from Southern California's
NOx Trading Program

NBER Working Paper No. 15082
June 2009
JEL No. L5,Q52,Q53,R20
ABSTRACT
A perceived advantage of cap-and-trade programs over more prescriptive environmental regulation
is that enhanced compliance flexibility and cost effectiveness can make more stringent emissions reductions
politically feasible. However, increased compliance flexibility can also result in an inequitable distribution
of pollution. We investigate these issues in the context of Southern California's RECLAIM program.
We match facilities in RECLAIM with similar California facilities also located in non-attainment areas.
Our results indicate that emissions fell approximately 24 percent, on average, at RECLAIM facilities
relative to our counterfactual. Furthermore, we find that observed changes in emissions do not vary
significantly with neighborhood demographic characteristics.

Introduction

Policy makers have a variety of instruments at their disposal when pursuing emissions reduction objectives. Traditionally, regulators have relied upon “command and control” (CAC)
approaches involving prescriptive emissions or pollution control technology standards. Increasingly, however, emissions trading programs are the preferred policy choice. In the
United States, the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAAs) of 1990 initiated a monumental
shift away from CAC regulation towards more market-based alternatives such as emissions
trading.1 In Europe, the European Union’s greenhouse gas Emission Trading System has
brought emissions trading to the fore.
Despite this prominence, questions remain about how emissions trading is working in
practice. First, can these market-based programs reduce emissions beyond what could be
achieved with more prescriptive CAC regulation? An important perceived advantage of
market-based approaches over CAC is that they can, in some circumstances, deliver more
significant public health and environmental benefits; lower compliance costs and greater compliance flexibility make more stringent emissions reductions politically feasible (Keohane et
al., 1998; Ellerman, 2006; Tietenberg, 2006; US EPA, 1992). Although this hypothesis seems
plausible, it has been diﬃcult to test empirically (Ellerman, 2003; Harrington and Morgenstern, 2007; Stavins, 1998; Tietenberg, 2006). Second, some have expressed concern that a
reliance on permit markets (versus prescriptive regulations and standards) to coordinate pol1

lution abatement activity can lead to environmental injustice (Kaswan, 2008; Vandenbergh
and Ackerly, 2007). If polluting facilities can achieve compliance by purchasing permits (versus reducing emissions), there is the possibility that permitted pollution will flow into areas
where poor or minority populations live. To the extent that there are pre-existing inequalities
in the distribution of environmental risks, these inequalities can be exacerbated.2
We assess these questions in the context of a renowned emissions market: the REgional
Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM). Our primary objective is to identify the causal
eﬀects of this emissions trading program on facility-level emissions vis a vis the CAC regulations it replaced. Our essential challenge is to construct a credible benchmark; a precise and
believable estimate of the emissions we would have observed in the absence of the program.
Design features unique to the RECLAIM facilitate the construction of this counterfactual.
More specifically, we can exploit the fact that only a subset of industrial facilities located
in non-attainment counties in California were removed from a CAC regime and required to
participate in RECLAIM.
The RECLAIM program marked many firsts for emissions trading. Specifically, it was
the first mandatory trading program to supplant a pre-existing CAC regime that was, in
theory, capable of achieving the same environmental objectives. It was the first program to
include a broad and diverse population of sources, making it particularly relevant to future
trading programs that will need to be more heterogeneous to achieve increasingly aggressive
air quality and climate goals. Illaudably, it was also the first emissions trading program to

and neighborhood location choices (see Banzhaf and Walsh 2008), few papers assess the environmental justice
eﬀects of emissions trading.

be challenged on the grounds of environmental injustice and noncompliance.
This analysis of the RECLAIM program is motivated by three observations. First, a
recent resurgence of interest in RECLAIM makes our study both timely and appropriate.
Cap-and-trade programs figure prominently in regional and federal proposals for addressing
climate change, thus drawing increased attention to past experiences with market-based
instruments in general, and RECLAIM in particular. Recent attempts to extract constructive
insights from the RECLAIM experience arrive at very diﬀerent conclusions. Whereas some
regard the program as a clear success (Stavins, 2007), others see a “spectacular” failure
(Green et al., 2007).3
Second, axiomatic questions about the eﬀectiveness in reducing pollution of market-based
programs relative to more traditional CAC regulations remain controversial and unresolved.
Compared to the previous literature addressing these questions (see, for example, Harrington and Morgenstern, 2007), we take a fundamentally diﬀerent approach.4 We exploit the
participation requirements of the RECLAIM program in order to construct semi-parametric
estimates of program impacts. Emissions trajectories at RECLAIM facilities are compared
3

Stavins (2007) summarizes domestic experience with emissions trading and reports that the RECLAIM
program has generated significant environmental benefits “with NOx emissions in the regulated area falling
by 60 percent.” Green et al. (2007) discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses of greenhouse gas emissions
trading relative to a carbon tax. While reflecting upon past experiences with the former approach, they note
that: “additional pitfalls and dilemmas of emissions trading can be seen through a review of the spectacular
trading failure of the RECLAIM.” They go on to argue that although “SCAQMD estimated that SO2 and
NOx would be reduced by fourteen and eighty tons per day, respectively,...RECLAIM never came close to
operating as predicted.”
4
Both Stavins (1998) and Ellerman (2003) note that, in the context of comprehensive cap-and-trade
programs such as the Acid Rain Program, it has been diﬃcult (if not impossible) to construct credible
estimates of the emissions that would have been observed under a diﬀerent regulatory regime. Harrington
et al. (2004) compare outcomes from controlling similar pollutants in the United States and Europe using
diﬀerent policy instruments. The limitation of this approach is that diﬀerences in outcomes across the
two contexts likely reflect social, cultural, political, and economic diﬀerences, in addition to diﬀerences in
regulatory regimes.

with those at similar California facilities outside of RECLAIM. One important advantage
of this approach is that it generates counterfactual emissions estimates that are free of the
potentially confounding eﬀects of changing economic conditions at the state-level, industrywide production trends, and technological change.
Finally, our empirical framework facilitates an analysis of how RECLAIM-induced changes
in emissions are distributed across communities with diﬀerent socio-economic characteristics.
For a number of reasons, the RECLAIM market has been the most criticized of any emissions trading program with respect to environmental justice concerns. Some contend that
RECLAIM has placed a disproportionate burden of the region’s air pollution in low-income,
minority communities (Drury et al., 1999; Moore, 2004). We combine semi-parametric
matching methods with parametric regression techniques. This allows us to examine correlations between RECLAIM-induced emissions changes and socio-economic neighborhood
characteristics with unprecedented precision.
Our results indicate that emissions at RECLAIM facilities have fallen by more than
20 percent, on average, relative to the control facilities (i.e. similar California facilities
subject to command and control regulation). These results are generally robust to alternative
estimation methods, functional form specifications, and diﬀerent control group composition.
We fail to reject the hypothesis that pollution reductions under RECLAIM were equally
distributed across neighborhoods with diﬀerent socio-economic characteristics.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides background on Southern California’s
RECLAIM program, emphasizing past experiences with program evaluation and environ-

4

mental justice issues in particular. Section 3 describes the research design and econometric
approach. Section 4 summarizes the data. Section 5 presents the empirical findings. Section
6 concludes.

Background on RECLAIM

In this section, we introduce Southern California’s RECLAIM program and provide some
background on two areas of emphasis: measurement of the emissions impacts of RECLAIM
and related environmental justice concerns.

2.1

A Brief History of the Regional Clean Air Incentives Market

Los Angeles suﬀers from some of the worst air quality in the nation.5 The South Coast Air
Quality Management District (SCAQMD) is the government agency responsible for regulating air pollution in the Los Angeles basin.6 In 1989, SCAQMD introduced an aggressive set
of rules and standards for stationary sources. Industry representatives fiercely opposed these
rules on the grounds that compliance costs would prove excessive.
In 1990, Congress turned its attention to the widespread failure of US cities to attain
health-based national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). Under the 1990 CAAAs, Federal NOx standards were significantly revised. Because SCAQMD was much further from
5
Air pollution problems are due in part to meteorological and topographical conditions; the basin is sunny,
warm, and poorly ventilated. The dense population, large number of vehicles, and high levels of industrial
activity also contribute significantly to the problem. In 1988, ozone levels in the Los Angeles air basin
exceeded state standards on 148 days (California Air Resources Board air quality data statistics accessed
may 15, 2008. http://www.arb.ca.gov/adam/php_files/aqdphp/sc8start.php). Estimates of health-related
losses due to the poor environmental quality in the region were approaching $10 billion per year (Hall et al.,
1992).

Figure 1 shows the district’s boundaries.

5

attainment compared to other air basins, the district was given more time to comply. Although required reductions in ozone concentration levels were larger for the Los Angeles basin
compared to other non-attainment areas in California, the required rates of concentration
reductions over time were quite similar.7
The CAAAs also provided general authorization for states to use market-based regulatory
programs to achieve federal standards. Market-based approaches to pollution regulation were
endorsed on the grounds that so-called “command-and-control” approaches were insuﬃcient
to address the worst of the nation’s air quality problems, and that market-based approaches
oﬀered a “historic opportunity to help reconcile the nation’s economic and environmental
aspirations.” (US EPA, 1992). While the use of economic incentives to achieve air quality
standards was discretionary in most cases, it was required in extreme non-attainment areas,
i.e., Los Angeles.8
SCAQMD responded by replacing over 40 prescriptive rules, which had been so opposed
by industry, with a market-based emissions trading program: RECLAIM.9 This program
was approved by state and federal regulators on the grounds that it would deliver emissions
reductions equivalent to—or greater than—what would have been achieved under the subsumed
command-and-control provisions, and would help to bring the region into compliance with
federal standards by the 2010 deadline.
7

Appendix A discusses the CAAA compliance requirements in more detail.
Pursuant to Sections 182 and 187, the US EPA issued a final rule and guidance on Economic Incentive
Programs (40, part 51, Subpart U) which outlined requirements for establishing EIPs. States or governing
bodies in extreme ozone nonattainment areas were required to design and implement economic incentive
programs (51.492, 182(g)5).
9
Although both NOx and SO2 emissions are capped under the program, the emphasis was on limiting
NOx emissions which are an important precursor to ozone formation.
8

6

At its inception, RECLAIM included 392 facilities whose combined NOx emissions accounted for over 65% of the region’s stationary NOx emissions (Schubert and Zerlauth, 1999).
Almost all facilities in the SCAQMD with annual NOx or SO2 emissions of four tons or more
are included in the program.10 Public facilities (such as police and fire fighting facilities)
were categorically excluded. Sources emitting less than four tons per year remained subject
to command-and-control programs.11
A RECLAIM trading credit (RTC) confers the right to emit one pound of emissions
within a twelve month period.12 Figure 2 plots the aggregate allocation trajectory over time
(the red line).13 NOx emissions permitted under RECLAIM were reduced by over 70 percent
over the first ten years of the program. By the end of 2003, the aggregate permit allocation
reached the level of emissions that the subsumed rules and control measures were intended
to achieve by 2010.
Early on, most firms found they had an excess of credits (the blue line in Figure 2
represents aggregate tons of NOx emissions).14 The aggregate cap did not start to bind until
10

Of these, 73% of these can be classified as manufacturing firms, 13% are involved in communication,
transportation or utilities, 2% are involved in construction, 3% are operating in the service sector, 6% in
wholesale trade, 2% are retail establishments, and the remaining 3% can be classified as government facilities.
11
Facilities could “opt-in” to the program. Facilities could not opt-out.
12
RTCs cannot be banked; a permit can only be used to certify emissions occurring within the twelve
month period with which the permit is associated. For emissions in any quarter, firms can use either permits
expiring in June or in December. Holland and Moore (2008) analyze this “overlapping cycles” feature of the
permits.
13
SCAQMD maintains a detailed database tracking all NOx permits and quarterly, facility-level emissions.
RTC price data were obtained from Evolution Markets LLC. Section 4 includes a detailed description of these
data.
14
Nonetheless, RECLAIM may have changed firms’ production and investment decisions in this early
period. A firm making a long-lived investment may have abated early in anticipation of higher future
prices. Furthermore, RECLAIM relaxed a vintage diﬀerentiated regulation, New Source Review, that has
limited firms abilities to modify facilities (Keohane et al. (forthcoming) discuss this literature). Under CAC,
operating permits are generally valid for several years unless modifications trigger New Source Review (NSR),
which can be contentious and costly. Under RECLAIM, traditional NSR regulations were replaced. There

7

1999 (SCAQMD, 2001). The figure helps to illustrates this “cross-over” point. While it is
clear that emissions permits were initially over-allocated, many believe that generous permit
allocations in the early years of the program were necessary to engender political support
for the program (US EPA, 2002). Because permits cannot be banked, impacts of the initial
over-allocation were confined to the early stages of RECLAIM.
Figure 2 also plots the trend in average RTC prices (the green line). In the first five
years of the program, prices for NOx RTCs remained relatively low, as expected.15 However, the increase in prices following the cross-over was much larger than anticipated; the
price of NOx RTCs increased from approximately $2000 per ton in January of 2000 to over
$120,000 per ton in March of 2001. During the California electricity crisis, many generators
without retrofitted NOx reduction equipment were required to run and hence exceeded their
allocations significantly.16 In May 2001, the RECLAIM rules were amended to reduce the
RTC demand from power producing facilities and to stabilize the sharply increasing NOx
RTC prices. The rule amendments (Rule 2009) isolated fourteen power producers from the
rest of the RECLAIM market. These facilities were not allowed to trade RTC’s. Instead,
is some evidence that RECLAIM’s internal NSR procedure may have facilitated NSR for the RECLAIM
facilities. For example, only “BACT” is required and necessary oﬀsets can be demonstrated with RTCs.
Furthermore, the RECLAIM annual reports show a very high rate of NSR activity. From 1994 to 2006,
the reports show that on average forty-seven RECLAIM facilities had NSR activity per year. In contrast,
Committee (2006) report that on average 125 NSR permits per year were issued for the entire country from
1997 to 2002 for NOx .
15
Before RECLAIM began, it was predicted that trading in the market would be slow at first because of
the initial surplus of permits. In 1994, SCAQMD economists predicted that prices for NOx RTCs would
average around $577/ton in 1995 and rise to approximately $1,100/ton by 1999 (Miller, Michael (1994).
“Firms Can Earn Credits for Keeping Emissions Down, Then Sell Them.” The San Francisco Examiner.
January 9, 1994: B1).
16
Kolstad and Wolak (2003) provide evidence that some electricity producers in SCAQMD intentionally
purchased NOx RTCs at higher than competitive prices so as to be able to artificially increase electricity
prices.

8

they were required to oﬀset excess emissions at a price of $14,000 per ton. In addition, these
facilities were required to submit plans to install the “best available” control technologies on
all existing power generating units by the end of 2004.17
By 2002, monthly average prices had fallen below $2000 per ton NOx . Regulators were
concerned that low permit prices were failing to provide suﬃcient incentives for facilities to
install pollution control technologies that would be needed to bring the region into compliance
with federal standards. In September of 2004, restrictions on power producers were made
more stringent and the aggregate RTC allocation for compliance years 2007-2011 was reduced
by an additional 20 percent.

2.2

RECLAIM Program Evaluation

Because RECLAIM represented such a major departure from the traditional regulatory approach, both federal and state agencies have required an unprecedented level of program
evaluation and oversight. In general, emissions trading program evaluation has proven to be
particularly challenging (Ellerman, 2003; Stavins, 1998; Tietenberg, 2006). Because industrial emissions are influenced by numerous factors, attributing changes in emissions patterns
to specific policy interventions is diﬃcult. These challenges notwithstanding, agencies in
charge of overseeing RECLAIM remain committed to evaluating the emissions impacts of
the program.
Unresolved disagreements about what constitutes an appropriate measure of counterfactual emissions has resulted in a plurality of opinions regarding RECLAIM’s overall per17

9

formance. Appendix B summarizes some of the contradictory evidence provided by past
program evaluations and reports. After fifteen years of program evaluations, the emissions
impacts of RECLAIM vis a vis the subsumed CAC rules remain controversial.18 Federal
policy makers and other stakeholders have expressed frustration over the lack of consensus
emerging from RECLAIM program evaluations, noting that the public is entitled to “real
world information and practical comparisons in order to judge for itself whether the program
is living up to their needs and expectations” (US EPA, 2002). Disagreements surrounding
counterfactual emissions beget disagreements about the overall success of the RECLAIM
program. The proverbial jury is still out.

2.3

Environmental Justice and Emissions Trading

The term “environmental injustice” refers to any disproportionate human health or environmental impact on minority or low income populations (EO 12898, 1994). Empirical research
conducted in the 1980s demonstrated significantly higher levels of exposure to environmental
hazards in traditionally disadvantaged communities.19 Subsequent work has brought more
sophisticated empirical methods to bear on this issue (Banzhaf and Walsh, 2008). A recent
review of the literature concludes that the evidence is mixed (Shapiro, 2005).
Environmental justice advocates have historically opposed market-based approaches to
environmental protection (Bansal and Davis, 1998; Drury et al., 1999). Kaswan (2008)
18

Some studies have constructed counterfactual estimates using ex ante expectations about economic
trends and the control factors for subsumed rules (SCAQMD, Various years). Critics contend that this fails
to account for unanticipated economic conditions or technological changes that aﬀect emissions patterns with
or without emissions trading. Other studies have tried to adjust ex ante predictions using ex post observed
emissions trends (US EPA, 2001). This approach likely confounds exogenous and endogenous changes in
emissions. See Appendix B for further discussion of these regulatory studies.
19
See, for example, Brown, 1995; GAO, 1983; US EPA, 1992.

10

provides a detailed discussion of the perceived tensions between environmental justice and
emissions trading. The most common criticism is that emissions trading programs fail to
account for the distribution of pollution damages whereas permitting under the CAAAs
can explicitly consider environmental justice concerns. If polluting facilities can purchase
permits instead of reducing emissions, it is possible for pollution concentrations to flow
into areas where poor or minority populations live, thereby exacerbating any pre-existing
inequalities in the distribution of environmental risks. On the other hand, market-based
programs could mitigate pre-existing environmental justice problems. If relatively dirty
facilities with low marginal abatement costs are disproportionately located in traditionally
disadvantaged neighborhoods, a well functioning permit market should ensure that a larger
share of the mandated emissions reductions will be achieved in these areas (Burtraw et al.,
2005).20
For a number of reasons, the RECLAIM market has been the most criticized of any
emissions trading program with respect to environmental justice issues (Chinn, 1999; Drury
et al., 1999; Moore, 2004). First, the Los Angeles area is home to an exceptionally diverse
population. Past studies have documented that race and ethnicity have historically played
a “persistent explanatory role” in explaining the distribution of environmental health risks
in Southern California (Morello-Frosch et al., 2001). Second, NOx is a non-uniformly mixed
pollutant. Damages from NOx emissions can vary significantly across space.21 Finally, the
20

An EPA analysis of outcomes under other the Acid Rain Program finds no evidence of disproportionately
adverse impacts on minority or low-income populations (EPA, 2005). A more recent paper finds that minority
groups receive a disproportionate share of the net benefits from the program (Shadbegian et al., 2007).
21
In the interest of avoiding “hotspots”, RECLAIM was designed as a zonal trading system. The SCAQMD
was divided into two zones: the region along the coast, and an inland region. Facilities along the coast (where

11

RECLAIM program was indirectly implicated in another highly controversial rule promulgated by SCAQMD that allowed stationary sources to oﬀset their uncontrolled emissions of
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using mobile source emissions reduction credits.22 Although RECLAIM was only indirectly involved in this high profile controversy, the program
has since been associated with environmental injustice.23

3

Research design

Previous estimates of the emissions eﬀects of RECLAIM are conditional on, and highly sensitive to, controversial assumptions about what emissions would have been in the absence of
the program. In this study, we exploit some unique design features of the RECLAIM program
in order to construct more tenable and transparent estimates of counterfactual emissions.
Rather than rely on ex ante expectations about what aggregate emissions trajectories would
have been absent RECLAIM, we use econometrically adjusted ex post observed emissions at
facilities that were subject to CAC regulation over the same time period. In what follows,
we introduce our empirical framework and identification strategy.
pollution problems tend to be more severe) may only purchase RTCs from other coastal facilities. Inland
facilities can purchase permits from either inland or coastal facilities.
22
This rule was challenged by a coalition of environmental groups on the grounds that it violated Title VI
of the Civil Rights Act; the rule allowed reductions in mobile source emissions (whose eﬀects are arguably
distributed widely across the region) to be substituted for VOC reductions at point sources located in
minority communities. The lawsuit was withdrawn by the plaintiﬀs two weeks after the case was filed. See
“CBE Sues SCAQMD Over Amendments to Car Scrapping Rule”, California Environmental Insider: 12 (7),
Sept. 15, 1998.
23
The RECLAIM program, as it was originally designed, permitted the use of mobile source credits to
achieve compliance. This mobile source credit compliance option was rarely used. Mobile source credits
represented less than 0.02% of the total allocation of NOx permits.

12

3.1

Empirical framework

Building on the potential outcome framework that is now standard in the program evaluation
literature (see Holland, 1986 for a survey), we assume that there are two regulatory states to
which the California’s industrial NOx emitters could have been assigned: the market-based
RECLAIM program or the CAC regime that prevails in non-attainment counties outside
of SCAQMD (and which the SCAQMD continues to use to regulate smaller emitters). Let
Di = 1 if the ith facility is in RECLAIM (i.e., the facility is “treated”). Let Di = 0 if
facility i remains subject to CAC regulation throughout the duration of our study. Potential
outcomes Yit (1) and Yit (0) denote annual emissions at facility i at time t conditional on
participation and non-participation, respectively.
We are primarily interested in estimating the average treatment eﬀect on the treated
(ATT):
αT T = E[Yit0 (1) − Yit0 (0) | Di = 1],

(1)

where t0 represents any year following the introduction of the RECLAIM program and αT T
measures the average eﬀect of the RECLAIM program on annual facility level NOx emissions.24
Emissions at both treated and untreated facilities are observed prior to the RECLAIM
program (i.e., when all facilities in California’s non-attainment areas were subject to CAC
regulation) and over several years following the introduction of the program. Facility-level
emissions data collected from RECLAIM participants during years following the introduction
24

We will also evaluate program impacts in percentage terms, although we will emphasize [1] as a more
informative measure of the overall eﬀect of RECLAIM on industry emissions.

13

of the program can be used to identify E[Yit0 (1)|Di = 1]. Note that [Yit0 (0)|Di = 1] is
unobservable.
The RECLAIM program applies only to major sources located within SCAQMD (see Figure 1). Thousands of California facilities located outside the Los Angeles air basin are subject to more traditional CAC. Furthermore, hundreds of smaller emitters within SCAQMD
remain subject to more traditional CAC rules. These incomplete program participation requirements provide us with a potential comparison group. We use econometrically adjusted
emissions outcomes of these non-participants to estimate the unobserved potential outcomes.
The simplest and most naive estimate of αT T is obtained using an unconditional diﬀerencesin-diﬀerences estimator. This estimator may be biased if variables that are related to facilitylevel emissions dynamics vary significantly across the treatment and comparison groups. In
order to reduce the bias potentially introduced by observable diﬀerences across RECLAIM
participants and non-participants, we will condition on observable covariates.
3.1.1

Regression-based conditioning strategies

Ordinary least squares (OLS) estimators can be used to control for factors other than regulatory regime that aﬀect facility-level emissions trajectories. We estimate the following simple
specification:
Yi1 − Yi0 = β 0 Xi + αDi + εi ,

(2)

where Xi is a vector of observable covariates that vary across observations. This implicitly assumes that the variables in X are exogenous to treatment status. In our case, these
variables will include facility level emissions observed prior to the introduction of the RE14

CLAIM program, industry classification, county-level attainment status, and pre-determined
zip code-level economic and demographic indicators. The parameter α captures the average
eﬀect of the RECLAIM program on changes in facility-level emissions over time conditional
on variables in X. The error term εi is assumed to be independent of the covariates in Xi
and the treatment indicator Di .
There are several potential problems with this approach. First, if there are regions of
the covariate space where there is only limited overlap in the distributions of X across the
treatment and control groups, the imputed missing outcomes will rely heavily on extrapolation. If functional form assumptions are incorrect, estimates may be biased. Estimates
of average treatment eﬀects can also be biased if control observations are not appropriately
reweighted to control for diﬀerences in the distribution of the X variables over regions common to the control and treatment groups. In the interest of mitigating these biases, we turn
to semi-parametric matching estimators.
3.1.2

Semi-parametric conditioning strategies

Matching estimators, which are used extensively in non-experimental program evaluation,
are an extension of standard regression approaches. Our general approach follows Heckman
et al. (1997, 1998) who introduce the following generalized DID matching estimator:
αd
DID =

X
1 X
{(Yj1 (1) − Yj0 (0)) −
wjk (Yk1 (0) − Yk0 (0))}.
N1 j I
k I
1

(3)

0

Here, I1 denotes the set of program participants, I0 denotes the set of nonparticipants, and
N1 is the number of facilities in the treatment group.25 The participants are indexed by j;
25

This assumes a common support which we explore in the next section.

15

the non-participants are indexed by k. The weight placed on individual k when constructing
the counterfactual estimate for treated facility j is wjk . Diﬀerent DID matching estimators
adopt diﬀerent approaches to defining the weights wjk used to scale the contribution of each
non-participant. In general, when the observable characteristics, Xi , of an untreated unit
k are closer to the characteristics of a treated facility j (relative to other facilities in the
control group), the untreated unit k is weighted relatively more heavily in the construction
of a counterfactual estimate for unit j. In what follows, we will be emphasizing a nearest
neighbor estimator and a propensity score-based reweighting estimator.
One clear advantage of matching estimators over standard linear regression techniques
is that they eschew parametric assumptions about the relationship between the outcome
variable and the covariates in X.26 Additionally, whereas treatment eﬀect heterogeneity may
bias OLS estimates of average treatment eﬀects, non-parametric matching estimators are
unbiased because they impose no restrictions on individual treatment eﬀects.

3.2

Identifying assumptions

Our most important identifying assumption is that the biases in the unconditional DID
estimates can be removed by adjusting for diﬀerences in observable covariates. More formally,
we assume that the distribution of the control outcome Yit0 (0), conditional on observable
facility and county characteristics (such as historic emissions, industry classification, county
attainment status), is the same among participating and non-participating facilities. If this
26

Smith and Todd (2005) compare results of matching and regression estimates using the same set of
covariates and demonstrate that avoiding functional form assumptions can be important in reducing bias.
However, if the true outcome equation is linear as in (2), failing to impose linearity will reduce the eﬃciency
of our estimates.

16

unconfoundedness assumption is satisfied, once we adjust for observable diﬀerences, we can
interpret diﬀerences in observed outcomes as the eﬀect of RECLAIM versus the CAC regimes
of other California air basins.
In order to interpret [3] as an estimate of the eﬀect of RECLAIM vis a vis the CAC
regulation that would have prevailed in the SCAQMD absent RECLAIM, it must be the
case that the emissions trajectories of RECLAIM facilities and the matched control facilities would have followed parallel trajectories absent RECLAIM. This implies a somewhat
stronger version of the unconfoundedness assumption: trends in the stringency of the control
treatment (i.e., the CAC regulations to which the control facilities are subjected) follow the
trajectory that the SCAQMD CAC regime would have taken absent RECLAIM.
Our estimation strategy also requires that the support of the distribution of the conditioning covariates in the treatment group overlaps the support of the distribution of these
covariates in the comparison group. Finally, in order to rule out spillovers and general equilibrium eﬀects, it must also be the case that potential outcomes at one facility are independent
of the treatment status of other facilities.
Some of these assumptions and identifying conditions can be directly tested. For instance,
it is straightforward to demonstrate that the overlap condition is satisfied by simply looking
at the joint distributions of the covariates in the treated and control groups. Other assumptions pose more of a challenge. Most importantly, unconfoundedness is not directly testable
in principle. However, we are able to conduct indirect tests. The weaker unconfoundedness
assumption implies that Yit0 (0) will be distributed similarly within sub-populations that are

17

homogeneous in observable covariates. As we have two diﬀerent control groups (i.e., facilities
located within SCAQMD exempt from RECLAIM, and similar facilities located outside the
SCAQMD), we can test whether the assumption holds across the two control groups.
The stronger unconfoundedness assumption requires that the control treatment resembles
the regulations that RECLAIM facilities would have been subjected to absent RECLAIM.
In Appendix A, we assess the plausibility of this assumption by looking at the ozone concentrations reductions mandated in SCAQMD vis a vis other California air basins over the
study period.

3.3

Treatment eﬀect heterogeneity

In addition to identifying the average eﬀect of RECLAIM on facility-level emissions, we are
interested in investigating whether treatment eﬀects appear to vary systematically across
facilities located in neighborhoods with diﬀerent socio-economic characteristics. Standard
DID matching estimators discard potentially useful information about the joint distribution
of the outcome variable Yit and the covariates in X that is unrelated to the treatment
indicator Di . We combine matching with parametric regression so as to investigate what
this discarded information can tell us about how treatment eﬀects vary with observable
neighborhood characteristics.
All of the matching estimators we use can be interpreted as nonparametric weighted
regression equations that weight treatment eﬀects according to the proportion of treated
facilities associated with each value of X. We specify a weighted regression model that
allows the treatment eﬀect to vary systematically with a subset of variables in Xi (denoted
18

Zi ):
Yi1 − Yi0 = β 0 Xi + αDi + θ0 Zi Di + εi

(4)

To investigate the extent to which emissions trading has exacerbated (or mitigated)
environmental injustice vis a vis CAC regulations, we define Zi as historic emissions, zip
code median income, and zip code percent minority. As a robustness check, we extend Zi to
include measures of regulatory variables, macroeconomic shocks, and industry fixed eﬀects
(see Appendix C).

Data

About 10,000 polluting facilities in California report emissions of criteria pollutants to the
California Air Resources Board (ARB). All polluting facilities are required to report to their
local Air Quality Management District; the ARB maintains a database of emissions reports
from the local districts. Our primary data comes from this database which also includes
information on industry classification beginning in 1990. We use addresses, geocodes, and
industry classifications to ensure a consistent coding of facilities across our panel.27 We also
use separate emissions data from RECLAIM to verify the emissions reported to the ARB
database.28
In the regressions, we use zip code level demographics data from the year 2000 Census
27

To ensure consistent coding over time, we identify facilities with diﬀerent ID’s but the same address and
SIC. If the facilities do not report emissions in more than one overlapping year, then we code the facilities
with the same ID. To ensure consistent coding within a year, we combine facilities with diﬀerent ID’s but
the same geocodes and SIC.

Details available upon request. The data from RECLAIM were obtained under a public records request
and included information on allocations and quarterly emissions.

Summary File 3.29 The data include median household income in 1999 (variable p53) and
population by ethnicity and race (variable p7). We construct a measure of percent minority
as the percent of the zip code’s total population that is either non-Hispanic black or Hispanic.
See Figure 1 for the spatial distribution of this measure.
Figure 3 shows the declining trends in total NOx emissions at California facilities between
1990 and 2005. The figure illustrates that, in the aggregate, NOx emissions from both
facilities in RECLAIM and those in comparison groups were declining at similar rates prior
to the introduction of RECLAIM. In the early years of the RECLAIM program (i.e., when the
aggregate cap was not binding) emissions of RECLAIM facilities appear to increase slightly
relative to facilities outside the program. After the cross-over point in 2000, however, the
average rate of emissions decrease among RECLAIM facilities exceeds that of non-RECLAIM
facilities. Overall, emissions among RECLAIM facilities have dropped 72 percent relative to
pre-1993 levels, whereas emissions among non-participating facilities have dropped only 62
percent over the same period.
Table 1 summarizes a balanced sample of these same data. To construct this table, the
data are partitioned into four non-overlapping periods. Period 1 encompasses years prior to
the introduction of the RECLAIM program (i.e., 1990-1993). Period 2 covers the early years
of the RECLAIM program when the emissions cap exceeded aggregate emissions (1997-98).
Period 3 includes years immediately following the “cross-over” point (2001-02). Period four
includes the most recent years for which emissions data are available (2004-2005). The sample
includes all facilities reporting positive emissions in each period. Overall, annual facility-level

emissions are significantly larger among RECLAIM firms vis a vis the comparison group.
Average emissions among RECLAIM facilities fell 70 percent between period 1 and period
4. We will subsequently refer to these unadjusted diﬀerences as “baseline” measures of the
average eﬀect of RECLAIM on facility-level emissions.30

This table also illustrates that

annual emissions are distributed diﬀerently across RECLAIM facilities and others in all
periods.
Table 2 examines the distributions of treated and control facilities within the eight industries which accounted for the largest shares of NOx emissions in Period 1. While refining
and electricity generation are the largest polluters, about 40% of emissions are from firms in
other four-digit SIC codes. Regarding the distributions of the treatment and control groups,
there are several points worth noting. First, the industry-specific means of the RECLAIM
facilities are not always larger. In fact, for seven of these eight industries, the RECLAIM
facilities are smaller on average than the control facilities in the same industry. Second, the
common support assumption is satisfied for most of these eight industries in the sense that
the intervals containing the minimums and maximums of the distributions are overlapping.31
Third, the table suggests a word of caution about our matching strategy. Ideally we would
like to match each treated facility with a large number of control facilities to average out
idiosyncratic shocks in our estimate of counterfactual emissions. However, the number of
control facilities within each industry suggest that some industries have a limited number of
30

When the sample is limited to just those facilities who were in compliance with RECLAIM over the
entire study period, average emissions fell from 72.2 to 31.5 (a similar percentage reduction).
31
Of the fourteen relevant minimum or maximum comparisons, eleven are satisfied. Note that this is rather
a weak test, since it may be driven by outliers. Ideally, we would like suﬃcient density over the common
support.

21

potential controls.32
Our panel of facility-level data is unbalanced. Of those facilities reporting emissions after
the RECLAIM program was introduced, only 60 (45) percent of RECLAIM firms and 32 (13)
percent of control facilities report emissions in the first three (four) periods. Facility-level
emissions data in a given period may be missing for a number of reasons, including firm
entry and exit, errors in the data, or simply a facility’s failure to report emissions in a given
period. On average, treated facilities reporting emissions in all periods were larger emitters
in period 1, although not significantly so.33 Section 5 discusses sample selection issues in
more detail.
In Table 3, we calculate the change in tons of NOx emissions exposure per capita. We
use census tract data from 2000 to determine the number of people within a demographic
group who live in a tract whose centroid is within 1/2, 1 and 2 miles of each facility.34
For each demographic group, we aggregate the change in emissions across people in that
group and facilities and then normalize by the group’s total population in the LA area. The
first three columns report the actual change in emissions from period 2 to period 3. We
find that all groups experienced a reduction of emissions.35 Within a 1/2 mile, the group
that saw the largest actual reductions was high income Asians while the group that saw
32

A limited number of controls may lead to poor match quality. We discuss match quality below.
Among RECLAIM participants, average period 1 emissions are 101.8 tons and 95.0 tons for “balanced”
facilities (i.e., those facilities reporting emissions in all four periods) and unbalanced facilities, respectively.
Among the control group, these averages are 87.8 tons and 52.9 tons, respectively.
34
This technique is similar in spirit to Banzhaf and Walsh (2008) but is more closely related to earlier
techniques used in the environmental justice literature.
35
Standard errors are computed by assuming the facility-level changes in emissions are iid. Simple T-tests
find that most groups within 0.5 miles had statistically significant reductions in emissions from period 2 to
period 3.
33

22

the smallest reductions was middle income Asians. These results change depending on the
distance from facilities. In section 5, we look at the relative changes in emissions, namely
the actual changes less the changes from our counterfactual control group, that we attribute
to RECLAIM trading.

Results

In this section, we present estimates of treatment eﬀects for the long-term view of the program
as well as for the window surrounding the price spike when we expect to see emissions
reductions from RECLAIM. The estimates are broadly similar across our three estimators
and are subjected to several falsification tests. We then present estimates of heterogeneous
treatment eﬀects and environmental justice and discuss selection issues.

5.1

Diﬀerences-in-diﬀerences estimates

Table 4 summarizes our main results. The control group is restricted to facilities located in
counties that, during 1990 and 1993, were not in attainment with the 1-hour ozone NAAQS
standards. The columns on the right pertain to diﬀerences constructed using facility-level
annual emissions data. The columns on the left construct diﬀerences using log transformed
values. The top panel (Panel A) presents a more long term view of program impacts;
facility-level emissions in period 4 are subtracted from period 1 emissions. Panel B compares
facility-level emissions immediately before and after the emissions cap began to bind in
aggregate. Recall that some electricity generators did not comply with RECLAIM when
permit prices spiked in period 3. We thus exclude these electricity producers from this period

23

2-3 comparison so as to focus on those facilities that were participating in (and complying
with) the cap-and-trade program.
We use a simple linear regression framework to generate DID estimates that condition on
observable facility characteristics that are that are likely to be correlated with unobservable
determinants of emissions. Covariates include industry fixed eﬀects and NOx emissions in
period 1. Conditional on the identifying assumptions of this linear regression model, we
find that RECLAIM program eﬀects on emissions changes over period 1 to 4 are highly
significant. Emissions changes immediately following the cross over period (from period 2
to 3) are also statistically significant in logs. The period 1 NOx coeﬃcient (not reported) is
statistically significant and negative in all specifications, indicating that historic emissions
are a good predictor of emissions in later years.

5.2

Semi-parametric matching

Within the class of matching estimators, there are a variety of matching algorithms to choose
from. Asymptotically, all matching estimators produce the same estimate. However, in finite
samples, diﬀerent matching estimators can yield very diﬀerent treatment eﬀect estimates,
particularly if one or more of the identifying assumptions is violated (Morgan and Harding,
2006). In this section, we present results using two semi-parametric matching estimators: a
bias adjusted “nearest neighbor” estimator and the so-called “double robust” estimator.
Nearest neighbor matching
The non-parametric nearest neighbor (NN) matching estimator constructs the counterfactual estimate for each treatment case using the control cases that most closely resemble
24

the treatment cases. If m nearest neighbors are selected for each program participant, the
wjk are set equal to 1/m for the selected neighbors and zero for all other members of the
comparison group.36 We impose a strict overlap condition; only those control facilities in
the same industries as RECLAIM facilities are included in the pool of potential controls.
Following Abadie and Imbens (2006), we augment our covariate matching estimation with a
regression-based bias adjustment so as to eliminate bias introduced by poor match quality.
After matching the treated facilities with m nearest neighbors, within pair diﬀerences are
bias-adjusted using a parametric regression of the control outcome on X.37
Table 4 presents these nearest-neighbor estimates. Matching covariates include pretreatment (i.e., period 1) NOx emissions, four-digit SIC code, and county attainment status.
These variables are likely to be correlated with unobservable determinants of facility-level
emissions, including production technology characteristics, firm size, demand for the products produced by the facility. Matching is exact on the categorical variables. Standard error
estimates are constructed using the variance formula of Abadie and Imbens (2006). Leaveone-out cross-validation methods are used to select the neighbor parameter m. Appendix
tables A1 and A3 demonstrate that our results are not overly sensitive to the choice of m or
the bias adjustment.
36

Although a larger m reduces the expected variance of the estimate because more information is used to
construct the counterfactual for each participant, a large m also increases the bias of the estimate as the
probability of making poorer matches increases. One drawback of this estimator is that all “neighbors” are
equally weighted, regardless of their distance from the treated facility. The bias of this estimator is of order
N 1/z , where z is the number of covariates in X.
37
More specifically, using data from matched control facilities, we regress the dependent variable (i.e.,
diﬀerences in emissions) on the covariates. We then use this regression model to impute counterfactual
estimates for all treated facilities. Note that these estimates are not likely to be sensitive to our parametric
assumptions because regression techniques are only used to impute diﬀerences in outcomes among very
similar facilities. These bias adjustments are discussed in more detail in Appendix C.

25

When the overall change in emissions between the pre-treatment period (period 1) and
period 4 is used as the dependent variable, the NN estimate, -17.79 tons per year, is statistically significant at the five percent level. This is approximately 17 percent of the average
annual emissions at RECLAIM firms in period 1. Using log-transformed emissions data,
the estimated coeﬃcient is -0.25, implying that emissions reductions declined (in percentage terms) by approximately 25 percent more, on average, among RECLAIM firms versus
matched control facilities. Because the estimated average annual percentage reduction is
somewhat larger than the estimated average reduction (in levels) expressed as a percentage of period 1 emissions, this suggests that percentage reductions are somewhat larger at
smaller firms.
Making the period 3 period 2 comparison, the NN estimate is -9.42 and statistically
significant. This represents 13 percent of the average annual emissions at RECLAIM firms
in period 2. The SATT estimate estimated using log transformed data is 0.26.
Propensity score matching
Since the seminal work of Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983), there has been considerable
interest in methods that avoid adjusting directly for observable covariates and instead adjust
for diﬀerences in the propensity score (i.e., the conditional probability of treatment). An
important result in the literature is that, if unconfoundedness holds, conditioning only on
the propensity score assures independence of Di and Yi (0). Recent work has demonstrated
that, when there is good overlap in the distribution of propensity scores for treated and
control units, reweighting estimators outperform nearest neighbor or kernel matching in

26

finite samples (Busso et al., 2009). In our case, all treated observations receive a weight of
one, whereas control observations receive a weight
score).

(where pb is the estimated propensity

The propensity score equation describes the process by which the data are filtered or
selected to produce the observed sample. The process that determined whether a facility
located inside or outside of SCAQMD is not directly observed. Consequently, the propensity score is an unobserved statistical object that needs to be estimated. We estimate the
propensity scores using a reduced form probit model. Explanatory variables include industry
aﬃliation, historic emissions, and squared historic emissions. We enforce a common support.
Balance is achieved and there is significant overlap in the propensity scores of the treatment
and comparison groups
Although matching on propensity scores balances treatment and controls across the set
of covariates, facilities with very similar propensity scores may have diﬀerent combinations
of observable characteristics. In our case, we find that matching on p-scores does not always
imply a close match on observables (even after adding higher order terms to the selection
equation). This poor match quality can introduce bias. Consequently, we use a propensity
score based refinement of weighted regression: the so-called “double robust” (DR) estimator
(Robins et al.,1995; Robins and Ritov, 1997). By combining propensity score matching with
regression, we can reduce bias introduced by poor match quality.38 Table 4 summarizes the
main results. These SATT estimates are larger in absolute value as compared to the NN
38

This double robust estimator will not always constitute an improvement upon the more standard parametric regression approach. Reweighting of observations will only add noise if the parametric regression
model is correctly specified (Freedman and Berk, 2008).

estimates and somewhat noisier.
Robustness of semi-parametric matching estimates
Our empirical results indicate that emissions reported by facilities in the RECLAIM
program fell by significantly more over the fifteen year study period (i.e., 1990-2005) as
compared to emissions reported by a group of California facilities located in non-attainment
counties, operating in the same industries, with similar pre-RECLAIM emissions levels.
When we narrow our focus to the window of time surrounding the cross-over point (i.e.,
the point at which the aggregate cap began to bind), we continue to find that emissions
reductions among RECLAIM firms are significantly greater on average as compared to the
matched controls. In order to interpret these estimates as an unbiased measure of RECLAIM
program impacts, some important assumptions must hold. We investigate the plausibility
of these assumptions here.
First, our analysis is predicated on the assumption that the emissions trajectories of
firms in the control group are representative of the emissions trajectories that would have
been observed at similar RECLAIM facilities had RECLAIM not been implemented. Put
diﬀerently, we assume that facilities with the same observed covariates should follow parallel
emissions trajectories if they are subject to CAC regulation in a non-attainment county.
Discontinuities in RECLAIM participation requirements allow us to indirectly test this unconfoundedness assumption. We do this by means of a false experiment. We redefine our
“treated” group to be facilities in the SCAQMD but not regulated by RECLAIM. Our pool
of control facilities consists of facilities located in non-attainment areas other than the South

28

Coast. If unconfoundedness holds, the estimated “treatment eﬀects” in this false experiment
should not be statistically significantly diﬀerent from zero.
Table 5 summarizes the results from this experiment. We find that the change in the average emissions (in levels) among these facilities located in SCAQMD that remained subject to
more prescriptive forms of emissions regulation is not statistically diﬀerent from that of the
control group. Put diﬀerently, the emissions trajectories among smaller SCAQMD facilities
exempt from RECLAIM and the emissions at similar facilities located in other California air
basins follow parallel paths. This is consistent with our unconfoundedness assumption.
Diﬀerences in percentage changes in emissions (i.e., the estimates obtained using logtransformed emissions data) tell a somewhat diﬀerent story. In the more long run comparison, estimated eﬀects of being located in SCAQMD (yet exempt from RECLAIM) versus
located in another California non-attainment area are negative and substantially smaller in
absolute value than the estimates reported in panel A. The double robust estimate is statistically significant, suggesting that the percentage reduction in emissions observed over this
ten year period was larger among low-emitting firms subject to SCAQMD CAC regulation
as compared to small emitters located in other non-attainment areas of California. We find
the reverse is true in the period 2-period 3 comparison. In sum, although results using
untransformed data generally support the unconfoundedness assumption, results generated
using log-transformed data are less clear
One might also be concerned that, in response to the introduction of the RECLAIM
program, production and associated emissions moved from RECLAIM facilities to those

29

exempt from the program. This would bias upwards our counterfactual emissions estimates,
and exaggerate our estimates of program impacts. To investigate this issue, we experiment
with using diﬀerent subsets of the control group to identify the sample average treatment
eﬀect. In one exercise, we exempt Los Angeles facilities from the control group. In another
exercise we include only Northern California facilities. Table 6 summarizes these results.
Our point estimates are not substantially impacted. Our nearest neighbor estimates remain
highly statistically significant. Our double robust estimates are quite noisy, in part due to
the smaller sample size, and are harder to statistically distinguish from zero.
The final row of table 6 report SATT estimates obtained using only data from facilities
in severe (versus moderate) non-attainment areas as controls. Estimated program eﬀects are
substantially larger in absolute value. This result is consistent with the idea that the political palatability of emissions trading programs vis a vis CAC regulations makes it feasible to
introduce more aggressive environmental standards. In the early 1990s, California counties
that had historically suﬀered from more severe air quality problems had more strict regulations in place (Figure A1). In these counties, industrial stakeholders would presumably have
be more resistant to the introduction of more stringent emissions regulations, as compared
to facilities in regions where the marginal costs of air quality improvements was relatively
low. If this were the case, we would expect that the eﬀects of market-based regulations (in
terms of emissions reductions achieved) would be greater when comparisons are made against
counties facing similar (versus less) political opposition to increased regulatory stringency.

30

5.3

Environmental justice

The literature on environmental justice is concerned that polluters in poor or minority neighborhoods may have been able to avoid reducing emissions by purchasing permits (Bansal,
1998). In this section, we ask whether trading resulted in changes in emissions that are
correlated with the demographics of the polluters location. From Tables 5 and 6, we conclude that emissions reductions were significantly greater among facilities in the RECLAIM
program relative to the CAC counterfactual we construct. We now investigate whether these
RECLAIM program impacts were more or less felt by traditionally disadvantaged neighborhoods in the SCAQMD.
In Tables 7 and 8, we use non-parametric matching methods to construct a counterfactual
change in emissions for each regulated (and compliant) facility and then regress the diﬀerence
between the actual change and the predicted change on a number of covariates measuring
environmental justice. We present results from several alternative specifications for both the
overall eﬀects of the program. Table 7 presents results from the period 2 and 3 comparison;
Table 8 investigates the period 1 to 4 comparison. Results are generated using both nearest
neighbor and propensity score matching. The results are qualitatively similar.
Specification 1 includes only a treatment dummy, period 1 NOx emissions, and an interaction between these two covariates as explanatory variables. This specification is similar to
the linear regression equation introduced in section 5.1, although less restrictive because it
includes group (versus industry) fixed eﬀects and allows the Period 1 NOx coeﬃcient to vary
across the treatment and control group. The Treat * Period 1 NOx coeﬃcient is statistically

31

significant. Conditional on group fixed eﬀects and the Period 1 NOx variable, this is the
eﬀect of historic emissions on the change in emissions at RECLAIM facilities relative to that
eﬀect for all firms. For example, in Panel A of Table 7, the coeﬃcient of -0.06 implies that for
each additional ton that a facility emitted in period 1, it reduced emissions between periods
2 and 3 by an additional 0.06 tons relative to the control group.
Specifications (2) through (7) include income and race covariates. Specification (7) includes historic NOx emissions and all demographic variables. In this specification, neither
median income nor percent minority are statistically significant predictors of the changes in
emissions in RECLAIM. The same is true within the control group; neither income nor race
are significant determinants of changes in emissions. The change in emissions per capita
reported in Table 3 show similar findings. For both the actual change in emissions as well as
the relative change (the diﬀerence between the actual change and the change for the control
group), emissions fall for almost all demographic groups. Furthermore, the changes do not
have a clear pattern based on income or race.
In all specifications containing Treat * Period 1 NOx, the variable is statistically significant, indicating larger emissions reductions at larger facilities. Appendix Figure A3 helps to
illustrate this relationship between changes in emissions and historic emissions both for REe sample resulting
CLAIM and other facilities in more detail. As with Table 7, we use the N

from Table 5.39 In Figure A3, we smooth the observations, separately for RECLAIM and for
39

In particular, we use the results from the top row, period 1 to 4, m = 3. For each treated observation,
we construct a measure of what the change in emissions would have been for the control group if the control
group had the same historic emissions as the treated observation. This is done by using bias adjustments
developed by Abadie and Imbens (2006) to mitigate bias introduced by poor match quality. We use a
quadratic fit (see Appendix C).

32

other facilities, using a k-Nearest Neighbor estimator. We see that the relationship between
historic emissions and change in emissions is decreasing over the range of zero to 80 tons per
year of historic emissions. In contrast, the control group is relatively flat at zero for most of
the range: from zero to 55 tons that accounts for over 80% of the sample.
In all specifications, the Period 1 NOx coeﬃcient is statistically significant. Ideally, our
within group matching on historic NOx emissions would be perfect and the Period 1 NOx
coeﬃcient would not be identified. In fact, our data are not suﬃciently rich to facilitate
perfect matching; historic emissions do vary within a group of matched facilities. Moreover,
we find that this within-group variation in historic emissions is significantly correlated with
the dependent variable. In light of these results, we are concerned about bias introduced by
poor match quality. All of our matching estimation incorporates a parametric adjustment
to mitigate this bias (Abadie and Imbens, 2006).
Appendix C explores the robustness of the results presented in Table 7. The results
are robust to including noncompliant facilities and to the inclusion of other variables like
regulatory variables, macroeconomic shocks, and industry fixed eﬀects (Table A4). The
demographic variables are not significant if subsets of the demographic variables are excluded
(Table A3).

5.4

Selection issues

We are also concerned about the unbalanced nature of our panel. In order to interpret our
results as a measure of the average eﬀect of the RECLAIM program on facility-level emissions,
the subset of facilities reporting emissions should be representative of the populations of
33

RECLAIM and control facilities, respectively. The group of facilities reporting emissions
changes over our sample period. Non-random selection into the data could imply that our
estimates of the average program impacts among the population of RECLAIM facilities may
be biased. Intuitively the direction of selection bias, were it present, is unclear. One might
be concerned that facilities with relatively high abatement costs would be more likely to exit
a CAC regime that oﬀers less compliance flexibility. This would result in inflated estimates
of RECLAIM program impacts vis a vis the CAC counterfactual. On the other hand, if
a market based approach does make more stringent emissions reductions more politically
feasible, we might expect to see facilities with relatively high abatement costs exiting the
SCAQMD with higher frequency, biasing our results in the opposite direction.
One common approach to addressing sample selection issues involves augmenting the
outcome equation with an inverse Mills ratio estimated using a parametric selection model
(Heckman, 1979). We use a probit model to represent the selection process. When we include
facility-specific inverse Mills ratios as an additional explanatory variable in our parametric
regressions, the estimated coeﬃcient on this ratio is not statistically significant. Although
this suggests that selection bias does not contaminate our estimates, we report these results
with some important caveats. First, there are no variables included in the selection equation
that can be credibly excluded from the outcome equation. Moreover, we oﬀer no intuitive
motivation for the parametric assumptions underlying our model of the selection process.
Another approach to assessing whether the unobserved factors that drive the selection
process are biasing our results is to investigate whether our results change significantly if we

34

generate our results using only those units that are observed over the entire sample. Our
estimates of program impacts over the full time period, and in the late (post cross-over)
period are not significantly diﬀerent.

6

Conclusions

In this paper, we exploit some unique design features of the RECLAIM program in order
to bring new and illuminating evidence to bear on two important questions. First, did
emissions reductions at facilities subject to Southern California’s RECLAIM exceed emissions reductions achieved at very similar facilities subject to CAC regulation over the same
time period? Second, has the compliance flexibility aﬀorded by market-based environmental
regulation resulted in more (or less) pollution in traditionally disadvantaged communities?
Our results indicate that emissions at RECLAIM facilities fell approximately 20 percent,
on average, relative to the control facilities. However, during the period of great permit price
volatility, several facilities did not comply with the regulation. When these facilities are included in our analysis, we find that RECLAIM did not reduce emissions relative to command
and control during this volatile time. For those complying, emissions fell significantly more
at large facilities, as is consistent with scale economies in abatement technology. We find no
evidence that neighborhood demographic characteristics were insignificant determinants of
their changes in emissions.

Notes: We report the summary statistics on the balanced sample of facilities with positive
emissions in all four periods. For RECLAIM facilities, this includes both those that
complied with the regulation as well as those that did not. We report the mean tons of
NOx emissions per facility (e.g., 101.8) as well as the standard deviation 304.4). There
are 213 facilities in RECLAIM and 1273 in the control group. The control group is
restricted to facilities located in counties that, during 1990 and 1993, were not in
attainment with the 1-hour ozone NAAQS standards.

Notes: “RECLAIM Share” is the 4-digit SIC industry share of initial, period 1 NOx emissions. Most of the electric services did not comply (86%
of the initial emissions). For facilities with positive emissions, we also report the summary statistics of tons of NOx emissions during
period 1 for both treated and the control facilities.

Period 4: average of positive emissions in 2004 and 2005
Notes: The OLS estimates control for average NOx emissions during Period 1 (1990-1993) and
four-digit SIC code indicator variables, with standard errors clustered by air basin. The
nearest neighbor matching models match on historic emissions and four-digit SIC codes
and use the preferred number of matches (see Table A3). The propensity score matching
models match on historic emissions and two-digit SIC codes. For all models, the control
group is restricted to facilities located in counties that, during 1990 and 1993, were not in
attainment with the 1-hour ozone NAAQS standards. In Panel A, there are 212 treatment
observations of the sample of 1523. For Panel B, there are 255 treated, which excludes
the 13 facilities not complying with RECLAIM, of 1932. For the log specifications,
emissions differences are defined as ln(EmitX+1)-ln(EmitY+1) and all matching is on
ln(Emit1+1). We denote significance with *** at the 1-percent level, ** at the 5-percent
level, and * at the 10-percent level.

Appendices: Not for Publication
Appendix A: Emissions trends under the CAAAs
In 1990, Congress turned its attention to the widespread failure of US cities to attain healthbased national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). Title I of the 1990 CAAAs sought
to address urban ozone problems in particular.40 The requirements for the 96 metropolitan
areas failing to attain federal ozone standards were significantly revised. Nonattainment
areas were reclassified according to the extent to which they exceeded federal standards.
Each classification was subject to a diﬀerent deadline for achieving compliance. Figure A1
graphically illustrates the compliance requirements required under the CAAA for five air
basins in California. The dotted lines connect one hour ozone concentration values in 1990
(when the CAAAs were passed) with the Federal one hour standard (0.12 ppm) in the year in
which the air basin was required, under the auspices of the CAAA, to come into compliance.
Because SCAQMD was much further from attainment as compared to other air basins, the
district was given more time to comply.
The stronger unconfoundedness assumption described in Section 3.2 requires that the
control treatment resembles the regulations that RECLAIM facilities would have been subjected to absent RECLAIM. To assess the plausibility of this assumption (albeit crudely)
we look at the ozone concentrations reductions mandated in SCAQMD vis a vis other California air basins over the study period. Figure A1 illustrates the compliance requirements
40

Of all the criteria air pollutants regulated under the auspices of the Federal Clean Air Act, ground level
ozone has proven to be the most recalcitrant. Ozone is the primary constituent of smog. It is a highly
reactive compound that can damage the linings of the respiratory tract, reduce lung function, and aggravate
pre-existing respiratory conditions. In 1990, an estimated sixty percent of Americans lived in metropolitan
areas that were failing to meet Federal health-based ozone standards.

required under the CAAA for five air basins in California. The dotted lines connect one
hour ozone concentration values in 1990 (when the CAAAs were passed) with the Federal
one hour standard (0.12 ppm) in the year in which the air basin was required, under the auspices of the CAAA, to come into compliance. The broken lines represent the more recently
required ozone concentration reduction trajectories that pertain to the federal 8-hour ozone
standard.41 The black lines (associated with the highest ozone concentrations) correspond
to the SCAQMD.
Because SCAQMD was much further from attainment as compared to other air basins,
the district was given more time to comply. Although ozone concentrations (and thus the
extent of non-attainment) in the South Coast significantly exceed that of other California
non-attainment areas, mandated reductions follow similar–if not parallel–trajectories over
time. Figure A1 illustrates that mandated ozone concentration reduction trajectories were
similar across California’s non-attainment counties. This is consistent with, but certainly
not proof of, the hypothesis that regulations of NOx emissions from industrial sources in
SCAQMD and other non-attainment areas would have followed parallel paths over the time
period we study absent RECLAIM.

Appendix B: Ex post evaluation of the RECLAIM program
Evaluations of the RECLAIM program have been carried out by SCAQMD staﬀ (SCAQMD,
Various years), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA 2002; US
41

In 1997, the EPA concluded that the 1-hour standard was inadequate for protecting public health.
The Agency issued a Federal 8-hour standard of 0.08 ppm which was oﬃcially upheld by the courts in 2001. Deadlines for compliance with the 8-hour standard can be found at
http://www.epa.gov/ozonedesignations/regions/region9desig.htm.

EPA 2006), and academic researchers (Gangadharan, 2000; Schubert and Zerlauth, 1999).
Although these studies and reports arrive at diﬀerent conclusions, there is consensus that a
RECLAIM program evaluation is an important exercise:
How have actual emissions reductions [in RECLAIM] compared to those that
would have occurred under the subsumed CAC system? While there can be no
definitive answer, this question is so central to the aﬀected public in any area
contemplating converting from CAC to a trading based program that we are
obligated to try to answer it. (US EPA, 2002)

In the periodic program evaluations carried out by SCAQMD, the aggregate RTC permit
allocation serves as a proxy for counterfactual emissions. The authors maintain that this is
a reasonable, and potentially conservative estimate of counterfactual emissions because the
aggregate permit allocation was designed to track ex ante expected endpoint mass emissions
under the subsumed suite of CAC rules that were being fiercely opposed by industry. These
periodic evaluations routinely conclude that RECLAIM is achieving emissions reductions
equivalent, and possibly greater, than what would have been achieved under the subsumed
CAC measures.
A comprehensive EPA study (US EPA, 2002) argues that assumptions made during initial
projections for the RECLAIM program were “not valid predictors of real world behavior,”
nor were they substantiated with actual data (US EPA, 2002). Consequently, initial RTC
allocations are dismissed as invalid measures of counterfactual emissions. The authors allege
that RECLAIM has “produced far less emissions reductions than could have been expected
from the subsumed CAC system” (US EPA, 2002).42
42

SCAQMD was quick to respond to allegations that their counterfactual emissions significantly exceeded
that which could realistically have been expected under the subsumed CAC rules. This dispute was never

iii

Unresolved disagreements about what constitutes an appropriate measure of counterfactual emissions has resulted in a plurality of opinions regarding RECLAIM’s overall performance. Whereas the Deputy Executive Oﬃcer for the California Air Resources Board has
stated publicly that RECLAIM “hasn’t done as well as the regulations it replaced” (US EPA,
2006), a Pew Center report concludes that “the [RECLAIM] program’s ten-year phase-in design and trading provided the flexibility that led to the achievement of environmental goals
that had been previously elusive.” (Ellerman et al., 2003).

Appendix C: Robustness to Estimates
This appendix tests the robustness of the main results. First we examine the overall match
quality (see Figure A2). In Table A1, we explore the robustness of our nearest neighbor
results in Table 4 to the bias adjustments we make using no correction, a linear correction,
and a quadratic correction. Patterns of coeﬃcient significance are unaﬀected by the bias
adjustments.
For the observations used in Panel A of Table 8, Table A2 summarizes the demographic
data and other covariates we use to test the robustness of the environmental justice results.
These include: a variable measuring whether toxics were measured on site from the California
ARB’s Air Toxics “Hot Spots” Program (http://www.arb.ca.gov/AB2588/overview.htm);
annual county employment, payroll and establishments variables; an indicator of whether
the RECLAIM facility was located in the coastal zone with restricted permit access; and
resolved. A more recent, retrospective overview of the RECLAIM program published by the US EPA
concludes: “RECLAIM shows the critical nature of baseline credibility in a program’s perceived success or
failure”(US EPA, 2006).

indicators of two-digit SIC codes for major industries. When including these in the environmental justice analysis, the only coeﬃcients for the treatment eﬀects that are significant are
the average eﬀect, historic emissions, and petroleum refining (which is positive).
Table A3 reports the robustness of the main nearest neighbors matching results to the
number of neighbors. For the overall eﬀect (period 1 to 4), the results are significant and
qualitatively similar for 1, 2, or 3 neighbors. With more neighbors, the estimates are only
weakly significant. For the trading eﬀects (period 2 to 3), the results are quite similar for 2,
3, 4, or 5 neighbors.

Appendix Figures and Tables

Figure A1: Required Ozone Concentration Reductions for Five Californian Air Basins.
Notes: This figure illustrates the ozone concentration reductions required of the five California air basins with the most severe air quality problems. Dotted lines
connect an area's 1990 "design value" with the Federal 1- hour ozone standard in the year the basin is required to achieve compliance. A design value is an air
quality measurement that is used to determine an area's air quality status (in reference to a National Ambient Air Quality Standard). Areas that had relatively high
ozone concentrations in 1990 (and high design values) were given more time to come into attainment with the Federal standard. Compliance deadlines were
established under the CAAA 1990. In 1997, the EPA issued a Federal 8-hour standard of 0.08 ppm. This standard was officially upheld by the courts in 2001.
The broken lines connect an area's 8-hour design standard (measured in 2001) and the Federal 8-hour standard in the year the area must comply with this
standard. Deadlines for compliance with the 8-hour standard can be found at http://www.epa.gov/ozonedesignations/regions/region9desig.htm. Historical data on
ozone design values are available from California Air Resources Board: http://www.arb.ca.gov/adam/php_files/aqdphp/sc8start.php.

Notes: All matching models match on average NOx emissions during Period 1 (1990-1993) and
four-digit SIC codes. In addition, the control group is restricted to facilities located in
counties that, during 1990 and 1993, were not in attainment with the 1-hour ozone
NAAQS standards. In the first row, the dependent variable is the change in NOx
emissions from period 1 to period 4 (215 treatment observations of the sample of 2421).
The second row is the change from period 2 to 3 (255 treated, excluding the 13 facilities
not complying with RECLAIM, of 2217). m(#) specifies the number of matches to be
