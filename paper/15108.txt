ABSTRACT
Important behavioral factors such as default and framing effects are increasingly being employed to
optimize decision-making in a variety of settings, including individually-directed retirement plans.
Yet such approaches may have unintended “spillover” effects, as we show with regard to the introduction
of lifecycle funds in U.S. 401(k) plans. As anticipated, lifecycle funds do reshape individual portfolio
choices through large default and framing effects. But unexpectedly, they also create a new class of
investors which holds these funds as part of more complex portfolios. Our results are directly relevant
to those interested in retirement plan design and retirement security; they also highlight the importance
of assessing such spillover effects in other consequential settings where behavioral economics techniques
may be employed.

Default, Framing and Spillover Effects:
The Case of Lifecycle Funds in 401(k) Plans
Olivia S. Mitchell, Gary R. Mottola, Stephen P. Utkus and Takeshi Yamaguchi
I. Introduction
Default options and framing techniques have both emerged as useful strategies for
remedying numerous apparent deficiencies in individual decision-making. For example, in the
case of U.S. defined contribution (DC) plans, the U.S. Treasury in 1997 introduced an opt-out or
automatic enrollment regime in an effort to boost worker retirement saving. This design change
dramatically improved saving by low-wage and younger workers. The success of automatic
enrollment has in turn prompted a broader discussion of the role that "choice architecture" might
play in optimizing decisions in other domains, such as the environment, consumer protection,
and health care (Thaler and Sunstein, 2008).
Following on this earlier success, the U.S. Department of Labor in 2007 sanctioned a new
class of default investments for DC retirement plans (known as qualified default investment
alternatives or QDIAs) under the Pension Protection Act. The aim of this new policy was to
improve portfolio allocations among defaulted participants. One popular type of QDIA, known
as lifecycle or target maturity funds, are pension investment options that radically simplify
portfolio allocation decisions.1 With a lifecycle investment offering, plan participants select a
portfolio based only on an expected year of retirement. The fund’s portfolio manager is
responsible for all portfolio construction decisions, including initial allocations, daily rebalancing
and portfolio changes over the lifecycle. When offered on a voluntary (non-automatic) basis,
lifecycle funds might be expected to appeal to individuals with little or no experience with
1

In this paper we reserve the term “lifecycle fund” for the lifecycle concept. The term "lifecycle" is sometimes
broadened to include risk-based static allocation (SA) funds, such as conservative, moderate or aggressive funds.
SA funds are increasingly referred to as “lifestyle” funds.

2

portfolio allocation decisions – we refer to this as the investment framing effect, as it reframes a
complex portfolio choice decision as a simpler one. When these are designated by the plan
sponsor as a default investment, lifecycle funds would be expected to alter portfolio allocations
because of inertia – a default effect. But as we show in this paper, default and framing effects
are an incomplete account of the behavioral impact of changing the “choice architecture” in
retirement plans. Drawing on a rich dataset of nearly a quarter-million 401(k) participants
covered by over 250 plans in a variety of default and voluntary choice settings, we find that the
introduction of lifecycle funds also produces an unexpected result: it prompts the growth of a
sizeable new class of investors which uses these funds in unanticipated ways. This unanticipated
change in behavior we refer to as a “spillover” effect.
Our paper builds on an important literature regarding default effects in retirement plans,
particularly with respect to savings decisions (Madrian and Shea, 2001; Choi et al., 2003, 2005,
2006; Nessmith, Utkus and Young, 2007). It also builds upon an extensive body of literature on
portfolio allocation and trading choices, both in retirement plans and personal accounts
(O’Donoghue and Rabin, 1999; 2001; Benartzi, 2001; Benartzi and Thaler, 2001, 2002; Ameriks
and Zeldes, 2004; Agnew, Balduzzi, and Sunden, 2003; Mitchell, Mottola, Utkus, and
Yamaguchi, 2006a and 2006b; Benartzi, Peleg and Thaler, 2007; Calvet, Campbell and Sodini,
2009). We also draw directly from earlier findings that retirement plan investment menus frame
individual portfolio allocation decisions in sizeable ways, either as a result of inertia or naïve
decision-making (Benartzi and Thaler, 2001, 2002; Huberman and Jiang, 2006; Brown, Liang
and Weisbenner; 2006) or in reaction to excessive complexity, also known as “choice overload”
(Iyengar, Huberman and Jiang, 2004; Iyengar and Jiang, 2006). Two of these studies (Benartzi,
2001; Choi et. al., 2003) demonstrate similar unintended consequences among individuals who

3

are affected by default designations. But our results offer a more expansive understanding of the
effects of changes in decision architectures. As with prior studies, we confirm that default and
framing effects reshape individual choices and help explain many behavioral effects. But these
factors do not account for the full range of outcomes: indeed, as we show here, large unexpected
or spillover effects arise among individuals making voluntary choices, and in the case of
lifecycle funds, the latter can be as significant as the original intended default effects.
In what follows, we begin by describing our dataset and the rich complexity that arises
with the introduction of lifecycle funds in 401(k) plans. The empirical approach first considers
models of lifecycle fund adoption; next we analyze the impact that such adoption has on
portfolio characteristics. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings for
retirement policy and more broadly for models of behaviorally-influenced decision-making.

II. Data and Descriptive Statistics
To assess how the introduction of lifecycle funds affects 401(k) decision-making, we
investigate a unique panel dataset covering 258 defined contribution plans drawn from
Vanguard’s 401(k) recordkeeping system. The full sample used to explore adoption patterns
includes over 252,000 active participants in plans that introduced lifecycle funds during 2003-05;
all participants entering and leaving the plans due to normal workforce turnover are included in
the full sample.2 Variables available for empirical analysis include a wealth of detail on 401(k)
account balances, investment holdings, and account contributions,3 as well as key socioeconomic

2

Active 401(k) participants are those who are currently contributing to their employer’s retirement plan.
We focus our portfolio analysis on 401(k) contributions rather than fund balances because contributions are more
reflective of forward-looking intentions and unbiased by prior holdings.

characteristics including age, sex, household income, and non-retirement financial wealth.4 Also
available are important features about each plan’s offered investment menu, including the
number and types of investment funds offered and other plan design details. In addition, our
dataset includes monthly returns for all investments offered over an eight-year period (including
the three-year period under analysis as well as the five years preceding it).
Table 1 outlines the key attributes of the lifecycle funds introduced by our employers
over the period under study. Each lifecycle fund is named according to its target maturity date;
each involves a different mix of passively-managed US equity (including large-, mid- and smallcapitalization stocks), international equity (both developed and emerging markets), and US highquality bonds. Panel A indicates that total equity exposure in the funds for the younger
participants averages 89 percent (in the 2035 and 2045 Funds) versus 29 percent for older
participants in the Income Fund intended for those in their 60s and beyond. Panel B of Table 2
depicts how the lifecycle funds were introduced. In 45 percent of the plans lifecycle funds were
introduced de novo while in 55 percent of the plans, the participants had been previously offered
static allocation (SA) or risk-based funds. In this latter group, one set of plans added lifecycle
funds to a menu that included pre-existing SA funds, while the other group switched or
“mapped” the plans from SA to lifecycle funds.5 Finally, in some cases, the employer designated
the new lifecycle funds as the plan default. The default option influences mainly new hires who
are automatically enrolled (or who enroll on a voluntary basis but failed to submit an investment
election with their enrollment).

Household income is imputed based on zip codes as is non-retirement financial wealth, and is provided by the IXI
Company.
5
In the case of mapping from SA to lifecycle funds, sponsors could either switch all participant SA balances and
contributions into the new lifecycle funds, or allow existing balances to remain undisturbed while switching future
contributions into lifecycle funds. In both cases, the new lifecycle allocations would reflect the sponsor’s decision
to move the money, rather than representing an active employee election.

5

Table 1 here
Table 2 summarizes characteristics of the plans and covered workers.

There is

substantial diversity by age, income, 401(k) account balance, and non-retirement financial wealth
in our full sample (Column 1). Nearly one-fifth are new hires. The mean 401(k) balance is just
over $64,000.
Table 2 here
From this aggregate sample, we draw a group of lifecycle adopters for use in a
difference-in-difference (D-D) analysis of portfolio effects. This subset consists of lifecycle
adopters who were continuously employed in our panel during the 2003-2005 period; in other
words, it excludes new hires. Because default designations in our sample overwhelmingly apply
only to new hires, this group excludes defaulted new hires, and only consists of participants who
voluntarily chose lifecycle funds once they were introduced into their 401(k) plans. Comparing
these lifecycle participants with the full sample (Columns 1 and 2), we see that (non-defaulted)
lifecycle adopters tend to be younger, more female, and earn less than the full sample; they also
have lower 401(k) balances.
Lifecycle funds by their nature are intended as a single or complete portfolio. In keeping
with this intent, almost half (n = 10,750 or 44 percent) of those in the D-D sample are “pure”
adopters and direct their entire contributions to lifecycle funds (Column 3). The remainder of the
adopters (n = 13,862 or 56%) utilize lifecycle funds in an unexpected way: they contribute to
lifecycle funds along with other investment options in their portfolio (Column 4).6 Pure (nondefault) adopters are younger and more female compared to mixed (non-default) adopters, and

6

Over 95% of pure adopters contribute to only one lifecycle fund; mixed adopters contribute to 4.5 funds on
average.

6

they have lower 401(k) balances and non-retirement financial wealth. By comparison, mixed
(non-default) adopters tend to be older, more affluent males.

III. Factors Influencing the Adoption of Lifecycle Funds
Retirement plan participants may come to invest in lifecycle funds in a variety of ways.
First, the employer may designate the lifecycle funds as a default investment. As a result,
participants who are automatically enrolled (or who voluntarily decide to contribute but fail to
submit an investment election) are directed by design into an appropriate age-based fund, thus
eliciting a so-called default effect. Second, lifecycle funds may be offered to participants on a
voluntary (non-default) basis. The lifecycle funds examined here add neither new asset classes
nor investment management styles to the retirement plans we examine. As a result, participants
electing them on a non-default basis would presumably be doing so because the funds simplify
the portfolio allocation decision – what we refer to as the investment framing effect. But third,
in the voluntary choice setting that characterizes 401(k) investment decision-making, participants
may choose to invest in lifecycle funds using a more complex portfolio strategy, combining them
with other plan investments. This is the unintended spillover effect.
To assess the factors associated with each of these three outcomes—default, framing and
spillover effects—we begin with a straightforward Probit analysis of lifecycle fund adoption. In
equation (1), LCAdopteri,j,t refers to the probability that the ith participant holds a lifecycle fund
in the jth plan in month t as follows:

LCAdopteri , j ,t  PARTICIPANT  βPLAN  TREATMENT   i   t   j   i , j ,t (1)

7

where the dependent variable takes a value of 1 if the participant invests in a lifecycle fund in
month t, and 0 otherwise. The mean value of this time-weighted adoption rate is 15.1%.7 For
this analysis we use the full data (as described in Table 2), which includes both continuously
employed participants as well as new hires entering the plan for the first time. The

PARTICIPANT vector includes a New Entrant identifier indicating whether the participant
entered the plan after the lifecycle funds were offered (0 otherwise). The TREATMENT vector
measures aspects associated with the way in which lifecycle funds were introduced: for instance,
a Default indicator indicates whether the new lifecycle funds were designated as the default
investment option. We also interact Default and New Entrant to reveal the effect of new plan
entrants being defaulted into the lifecycle funds. 8 In addition, we control on the number of
months since lifecycle funds were introduced, Time Count (and that same variable squared), to
indicate the time path of impact of lifecycle adoption. The model also incorporates participant
socioeconomic characteristics including age, income, sex, and non-retirement financial wealth.
To control on cross-plan differences, the PLAN vector indicates the number of fund choices on
offer, a dummy indicating company stock is available in the 401(k) plan, and an indicator of loan
availability. For reasons noted above, we also control on SA_Before which indicates whether
static allocation funds had been previously offered.9

7

The mean value of lifecycle adoption is not 10% (in Table 1, 24,612 lifecycle adopters divided by 252,980
participants) because our measure is weighted according to the months in which lifecycle funds were offered. For
example, if lifecycle funds were offered in a given plan during 18 months of our analysis period, and a participant in
that plan contributed to those funds over nine months, his adoption rate would be 50%.
8
Not all new entrants are new hires. Many of the plans in our sample allow immediate eligibility for the plan to
new hires though a minority imposes a six- or twelve-month waiting period.
9
The econometric models correct for plan-level heteroskedasticity ( i ), time fixed effects (  t ), and industry fixed
effects, along with missing data controls.

8

Table 3 reports estimated coefficients and marginal effects for the Probit regression. The
most prominent finding is the strength of the default effect: if an employer designates lifecycle
funds as the default investment, the likelihood of participants adopting the funds surges by 10.9
percentage points, an increase of 66% in the mean adoption rate. (This might be called the “PPA
effect,” a measure of how much participation in lifecycle funds rises as a result of employers’
decisions to designate lifecycle funds as plan default investments under the 2006 Pension
Protection Act.) The default effect for new participants is even higher, indicating that newly
eligible employees are 14.5 percentage points more likely to elect lifecycle funds when the
employer offers these as the default investment.

Table 3 here
While the default effect is strong, lifecycle funds also prove to attract participants making
voluntary choices. This framing effect is quite powerful among new hires: even when the fund is
not the default, new hires are still 6.6 percentage points more likely to adopt lifecycle funds. In
addition, lifecycle funds are also more likely to be adopted by participants with characteristics
typically associated with low levels of financial literacy (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007). In our
regression results, young and female participants, as well as those with low 401(k) balances and
low levels of non-financial retirement wealth, are more likely to invest in lifecycle funds on a
voluntary (non-default) basis. With their ultra-simple decision framework, lifecycle funds
eliminate the need to make complex portfolio construction decisions.
Two other subtleties are associated with the framing effects of lifecycle funds. Voluntary
adoption of the funds appears to evolve linearly with time, such that each month following the
introduction of the funds boosts adoption rates by 0.4 points. In other words, the framing effect
becomes more attractive to participants with time. Also offering more funds in the 401(k) menu

9

slightly reduces participation in lifecycle funds. The effect is small (having 10 additional funds
means a two percentage point lower chance of holding lifecycle funds) but it does suggest that
the appeal of lifecycle funds is contingent on the breadth of the other investment offerings.
The results summarized in Table 3 combine pure investors (adopting only a single
lifecycle fund) with mixed investors (combining lifecycle funds with other investments). These
mixed investors are evidence of our unintended or second-order spillover effect. To further
disentangle differences between pure versus mixed lifecycle adopters, Table 4 reports marginal
effects calculated from a multinomial Logit model where the dependent variable equals 1 if the
participant is a mixed adopter; 2 if he is a pure adopter; and 0 if he is a nonadopter (the reference
group). The explanatory variables are the same as in the prior Probit model. Measured on a timeweighted adoption basis, there are somewhat more pure adopters (8.6 percent of the sample)
versus mixed (7.7 percent).

Table 4 here
For the pure investors, we see a default effect similar in magnitude to the prior Probit
model: the default designation raises adoption by 5 points on a time-weighted adoption rate base
of 8.6 percent, or 58 percent on a relative basis. The framing effects for pure investors are also
similar: new entrants are more likely to be pure adopters, as are young, female, low income, low
401(k) balance and low non-retirement wealth participants. The prevalence of pure adoption
also rises over time. By contrast, mixed adopters are unlike pure adopters along a number of
dimensions: for instance, they are less influenced by the plan's default fund designation
compared to pure adopters. Also the impact of the default designation on new hires is actually
negative: new hires who are defaulted are more likely to be pure adopters and less likely to be
mixed adopters. Demographically, mixed investors are likely to be younger and female, but

10

relatively less so than pure adopters. Moreover, they tend to be middle income and middlewealth participants compared to non-adopters. Mixed investors, in other words, do not appear to
possess the types of demographic characteristics or default behavior typically associated with
low levels of financial sophistication. It is true that they could simply be a group of middleincome and middle-wealth participants plagued by naïve diversification, combining lifecycle
funds with other options at random (Benartzi and Thaler, 2001). But another possibility is that
they are engaged in a more sophisticated approach to investing.10 Additional survey research is
needed to elicit the types of motivations driving the construction of these mixed portfolio
strategies. But at least from our data set, we can ascertain that the motivations, whether rational
or naïve, are disproportionately linked to middle-income and middle-wealth participants.
In sum, introducing lifecycle accounts have differential default and framing effects across
pension plan participants. Altering the 401(k) choice architecture generates both intended and
unintended consequences: default and framing effects are statistically and economically
meaningful among pure investors, but the spillover effect is sizeable and results in the creation of
a new class of mixed investors.

IV. Portfolio Changes Arising from the Introduction of Lifecycle Funds
We turn next to an assessment of how participant portfolios respond to changes in the
choice architecture of 401(k) plans. Life cycle funds are structured so that portfolio risk levels
decline with age following a so-called "equity glide path": younger participants intending to
retire further in the future will have a higher equity fraction and less fixed income, while older

10

For example, mixed adopters may only want to have a portion of their portfolio to be automatically rebalanced, or
they may be engaging in a “core/satellite” strategy of having the lifecycle fund as a core holding, supplemented by
satellite funds.

11

investors in these age-linked funds would hold less risky portfolios. In a rational agents’ world,
we would not expect the introduction of lifecycle funds to alter the age structure of equity
allocations. But if participants are swayed by default and framing and spillover effects, we might
expect that lifecycle funds will alter the equity gradient among participants. It is also worth
noting that the lifecycle funds in our sample are passive or index-based, and the participants in
our sample could have accessed a broad-based market index portfolio on their own, separate
from the lifecycle funds. As a result, in a world in which 401(k) decision-makers are unduly
influenced by behavioral biases, we might anticipate that the introduction of low-cost indexed
lifecycle funds would reduce the share of idiosyncratic risk in portfolios.
We use a difference-in-difference model to evaluate the impact of lifecycle fund adoption
on portfolio characteristics. Since we must observe a "before” portfolio (before lifecycle funds
were introduced), as well as an “after” portfolio, we omit new entrants and hence new workers
who were directly defaulted into lifecycle funds. For this reason, our difference-in-difference
analysis is based on the subset of approximately 25,000 participants who adopted a lifecycle
fund on a voluntary (non-default) basis, and focuses on framing and spillover (but not default)
effects.
Table 5 describes investment attributes of lifecycle adopter portfolios before and after
lifecycle funds join the menu, specifically, one month prior to adoption (time t-1) and six months
later (time t+6).11 Panel A summaries the allocation of participant contributions by major asset
class including cash (money market or guaranteed investment contracts), bonds, balanced or
lifecycle (and/or lifestyle) funds, US equities, employer stock, and international equities.
11

Because we observe participants six months after lifecycle funds are offered, both the full sample and subset of
adopters include only plans which introduced lifecycle funds by 6/05. The lifecycle adopter subset has 7 fewer
plans because these had no lifecycle adopters as of December 12/05. Of the 252,000 participants in the full dataset,
189,968 were included in their plan both one month before and six months after the lifecycle funds were introduced.

12

Overall, lifecycle adopters held more cash, bonds, and equity funds before the introduction of the
lifecycle funds; afterwards, their balanced and lifecycle holdings rises by 12 percent. It is also
interesting that many lifecycle adopters contributed to balanced or static allocation funds before
the new lifecycle funds were introduced; these funds account for 79 percent of pure adopters’
and 35 percent of mixed adopters’ contributions. This finding points to the importance of
controlling on the prior presence of the pre-existing menu design in order to evaluate the impact
of lifecycle funds on participant behavior. Pure lifecycle adopters cut their cash position by
almost five percent and their pure US equity holdings by 11 percent, and increase by 21 percent
their ownership of balanced funds; the impact is smaller for mixed lifecycle adopters.

Table 5 here
Panel B of Table 5 displays three portfolio attributes measured for lifecycle adopters,
again on a pre/post basis. The first attribute is the percent of the portfolio held in equities,12
where we see that, before the menu changed, the average lifecycle adopter directed two-thirds of
his contributions to equities. After the introduction of the lifecycle fund, equity allocations rise
by 1.4 percent for all adopters, with pure adopters devoting somewhat less and mixed adopters
somewhat more to equity. The second column of Panel B illustrates how participant portfolios
change in terms of overall systematic or risk-adjusted return. A participant’s systematic return is
the sum of the risk-free rate during the period, r f , and each participant’s factor return, or rie,t ,
derived from a three-factor asset pricing model.13 The results show that expected returns rise

12

Equity allocation is equal to the percentage of contributions directed to US equity funds, international equity
funds, company stock, and a percentage of balance/lifecycle funds. The equity percentage for balanced/lifecycle
funds was calculated based on each fund’s investment policies and varies from fund to fund.
13
Factor returns are computed using a three-factor model based on US equities, US bonds, and international equities
because, as noted earlier, the lifecycle funds in our dataset are composed of index-based funds mirroring these three
asset classes. To calculate portfolio returns we construct a risk-loading matrix for all k investment options in our
dataset by regressing the excess return (over Treasury bill returns) for each of the k assets in our universe on three

13

across the board for all adopters as well as for pure and mixed adopters (before controlling on
other factors including time effects; we say more on this below). Also the difference in expected
returns between pure and mixed adopters is small. For example, on a “before” basis, mixed
adopters held 15 percent more equity than pure adopters (70.7 is 15 percent higher than 61.4),
but their returns were only two percent higher (6.52 is two percent greater than 6.38). This
suggests that those who later become pure lifecycle investors had successfully constructed more
efficient portfolios with lower equity exposure but similar expected returns, mainly through
static allocation (lifestyle) and balanced fund holdings.14
A third portfolio attribute reported in Table 3 is the ratio of idiosyncratic portfolio risk as
a fraction of total portfolio variance, NSR / TVi ,t . 15 This measure describes how much of portfolio

variance is explained by nonsystematic or non-market factors. By definition, nonsystematic risk
should be zero when all of a participant’s contributions are directed to index-based lifecycle

market indices: the value-weighted CRSP portfolio, the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index (LBA), and the
Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Europe, Australia and Far East (EAFE) Index. The systematic return
for each 401(k) investment option is simply its factor exposure times the average factor returns over the period; the
participant’s factor return is simply the weighted average return of his or her factor exposures over the period. The
mean returns of our three factors (CRPS, LBA and EAFE) over the 96-month period are given by:
r f  (rCRSPRF ,t , rLBARF ,t , rMSCIRF ,t ) . The systematic return associated with the kth asset is its factor exposure times
the average factor returns over the 96 months, namely: rk  bk r f . The ith participant’s excess return reported in

Virtually all of the SA funds in our sample included broad exposure to US and international equities, as well as
US bonds. Many of the balanced funds did as well, although some were exclusively US-focused.

funds. Not surprisingly, given that all of our funds are index-based, this measure of risk is
eliminated for pure lifecycle adopters and it falls substantially for mixed adopters.
In a multivariate analysis of portfolio effects, we examine factors associated with the
same three portfolio characteristics, namely the individual’s allocation to equities, his systematic
returns, and his nonsystematic risk. The dependent variables are represented in a vector of
portfolio characteristics, PORTFOLIOi,j,t , , with the model taking the following form:
PORTFOLIOi , j ,t  PARTICIPANT  βPLAN  TREATMENT
  i   t   j   i , j ,t .

(2)

Model A includes just these terms, while Model B adds interaction terms to test whether specific
groups display differential treatment patterns when lifecycle funds are introduced. For example,
LC_Treat*Young allows us to examine the differential impact of lifecycle treatment on
participants under age 35.
Table 6 summarizes estimates for the equity allocation models, differentiating results for
pure and mixed adopters. The variable LC_Treat in Model A captures the simple change in
equity allocation after controlling for differences in participant and plan features, timing and
industry fixed effects, and plan-level heteroskedasticity. All else constant, pure adopters devote
less to equity (1.8 percentage points) but no change is seen for mixed adopters. Model B adds
treatment interactions for participant and plan characteristics, the most important of which is
with respect to age. Here it is clear that for pure and mixed adopters, younger workers invest
more in equity after lifecycle funds are introduced (LC_Treat + LC_Treat*Young), whereas
middle-aged and older people reduce their equity share. Figure 1 summarizes the age effects; the
old-young difference increases by 8-10 percentage points. It is also worth noting that the

15

changes in equity shares by age remains meaningful for mixed adopters, who on average direct
one-third of their portfolio contributions to lifecycle funds.
Table 6 and Figure 1 here
Not only does the overall age variation in equity exposure change when lifecycle funds
are introduced, but the distribution also becomes markedly less disperse (see Figure 2). 16
Whereas many participants had previously held equity holdings at two focal points (0 and 100
percent), and another group held a mid-range of equities (61-65 percent, a typical allocation in
many balanced funds), adopters’ portfolios change dramatically after the new funds are offered.
For pure adopters (Figure 2A), their revised equity holdings now concentrate around the key
target percentages underlying the lifecycle fund offerings. For mixed adopters (Figure 2B), the
zero and all-equity allocations are again mostly eliminated, though the changes are smaller.
Overall the cross-sectional standard deviation of equity allocations is reduced.
Figure 2 here
Next we consider the impact of lifecycle fund introduction on portfolio efficiency
measures. As shown in the first two columns of Table 7, pure adopters can expect higher
systematic returns of 19-21 basis points per year when they shift to an all-lifecycle portfolio.
The change in the age gradient of equity allocations results in a change in age-related returns:
young pure adopters see returns rise by an annualized 13 basis points (.0019-.0006), while older
pure adopters can returns fall by 25 basis points (.0019+.0006) per year, partly due to their

having been shifted to more conservative allocations at older ages. 17 For mixed adopters,
depicted in the next two columns of Table 7, changes in returns are not statistically significant.
Table 7 here
The second half of Table 7 indicates how portfolio nonsystematic risk shares (NSR)
change when lifecycle funds are introduced. Not surprisingly, nonsystematic risk virtually
disappears for pure adopters who switch their contributions to an all-index life cycle fund. It
accounted for 6 percentage points of total variance before lifecycle fund adoption and the
marginal effect of shifting to lifecycle funds is a negative 5.1 percentage points. The NSR share
falls less for younger participants (-2.9 percentage points) than for older participants (-6.2
percentage points). Changes for mixed adopters are more notable: after moving to lifecycle
funds, their NSR risk share declines by over 40 percent (a marginal effect of -8.3 on a mean of
19.9 percentage points). Accordingly, even middle-income mixed adopters who use lifecycle
funds for only portion of their portfolios will still experience a meaningful reduction in
nonsystematic risk exposure. In effect, we have another measure of the spillover effect: a
reduction in idiosyncratic risk intended for the pure adopter spills over into a broader population
of investors.
These results highlight the power of framing effects on the structure of portfolio
decisions. For pure investors electing lifecycle funds on a voluntary basis, adopting the lifecycle
offerings boosts equity exposure with age, eliminates extreme asset allocations, enhances
portfolio efficiency, and reduces nonsystematic risk exposure. Our results also identify

17

Pure lifecycle investors generally liquidate cash investments and shift their fixed income to bonds. Cash
investments have zero excess returns by definition, while over our study period, bonds earned excess returns of 23
basis points per month. Our younger pure adopters moved from a cash exposure of 3% to 0% when moving to
lifecycle funds, while older participants moved from 9% to 0%. For mixed adopters, younger participants reduced
equity holdings slightly, from 8% to 6%, while older participants moved from 11% to 9%.

17

meaningful and interesting spillover effects for mixed adopters, where introducing life cycle
funds compresses the variability in equity holdings, reduces extreme allocations, and curtails
nonsystematic risk – even when they do not move entirely into the lifecycle options. Spillover
effects, in other words, extend beyond adoption outcomes to reshape portfolio risk and return
characteristics.

V. Discussion

Default, framing, and other behaviorally-based strategies have been proposed in several
domains as a possible alternative to the need for enhanced consumer protection. In the pension
environment, this approach has prompted policy reforms including automatic enrollment and the
creation of a new class of designated default investments for 401(k) plans. Our paper considers
whether default and framing effects are a sufficient explanation for the behavioral outcomes that
arise from a change in the choice architecture. We use the introduction of lifecycle funds into
401(k) plans as a consequential decision-making environment for assessing this question.
Our findings demonstrate that changes in a given choice architecture, while having
expected default and framing effects, can also have important unanticipated or spillover effects.
Specifically, we find, as anticipated, strong evidence of default and framing effects: adoption
rates among pure investors, investing as intended in a single lifecycle fund, are nearly 60%
higher when the funds are designated as a default investment option. Also, in voluntary (nondefault) settings, the funds are chosen by individuals with characteristics often associated with
low levels of financial experience, namely young, low-income, and low-wealth investors.
Because the lifecycle funds add no new asset classes to the retirement plans we examined, this

18

effect measures the appeal of the unique decision framing offered by a lifecycle fund—replacing
the portfolio construction process with the choice of an expected retirement date.
But the introduction of lifecycle funds also produces a large spillover effect, namely, the
creation of a large group of mixed investors who utilize lifecycle funds in a more complex
approach to retirement saving. While this was an unexpected result from lifecycle fund
introduction, the effect is sizeable: the group of mixed investors is only slightly smaller than the
pure investors. Moreover, "mixed" adopters are typically middle-income and middle-wealth
investors, not characteristics typically associated with low levels of sophistication or naive
diversification. The spillover effect does result in meaningful changes to these mixed adopter
portfolios. These include less extreme portfolio allocations, more age-based variation in equity
exposure, and less idiosyncratic risk.
These results are directly relevant for retirement policymakers and plan sponsors seeking
to influence investment patterns in 401(k) plans. To the extent that the simplified framing of
lifecycle funds appeals to participants with characteristics indicative of low financial
sophistication, the designation of such funds as a default can markedly enhance portfolio
allocations for the least-informed group. Also lifecycle funds have been proposed for the federal
government employee Thrift Savings Plan, some state defined contribution schemes, and a
defined contribution plan suggested for the US Social Security system. Other countries such as
Chile currently use lifecycle-type funds as the default in their national defined contribution
systems.
Our analysis also holds implication for "choice architects" in other domains seeking to
remedy perceived deficiencies in individual decision-making with a range of behaviorallyinformed strategies. While default and framing do have a powerful role in altering individual

19

behavior, these are an incomplete explanation of the impact of changing the decision
environment. Thus, when altering choice architectures, it is critical to understand the potential
spillover effects that might occur, the magnitude of such effects, and whether their impact might
be judged to be detrimental or benign.
