The Impact of Assimilation on the
Earnings of Immigrants:
A Reexamination of the Evidence

ABS TRACT

This paper reexamines the empirical basis for two "facts" which seem to be

found in most cross-section studies of

immigrant earnings: (1) the earnings

of immigrants grow rapidly as they assimilate into the U.S.; and (2) this
rapid growth leads to many immigrants overtaking the earnings of the nativeborn within 10-15 years after immigration.

Using the 1970 and 1980 U.S.

Censuses, this paper studies the earnings growth

experienced by specific

immigrant cohorts during the 1970-1980 period, It is found that within-cohort
growth is significantly smaller than the growth predicted by cross-section

regressions for most immigrant groups. This differential is consistent with
the hypothesis that there has been a secular decline in the "quality't of
immigrants admitted to the United States.

THE IMPACT OF ASSIMILATION ON THE EARNINGS OF IMMIGRANTS:
A REEXAMINATION OF THE EVIDENCE

George J. Borjas*

I.

Introduction
The question of how immigrants do in the U.S. labor market has again

become an important policy issue due mainly to the rapid increase in immi-

gration rates during the postwar period. The work of Chiswick (1978, 1980)
has been extremely influential in the development of the current consensus
that immigrants adapt quite rapidly and quite well tc the U.S. labor market.
The two fundamental results in Chiswjck's research are that in a cross-section

of immigrant men: (1) the earnings of recently arrived immigrants are significantly lower than the earnings of immigrants who have been in this country
for longer periods, and (2) the relatively rapid growth of immigrant earnings

over time leads to the existence of aa

overtaking age, at which point the

earnings profiles of the native—born and the foreign-born cross. This creates
the remarkable finding that, for most immigrant groups at later stages of the
life cycle, immigrant earnings exceed the earnings of the native-born. In
Chiswick's (1978) study, the overtaking point was estimated to be around 10-15
years after immigration.
These findings appeal to labor economists since the human capital frame-

work can be easily invoked to explain the empirical regularities. In particular,
persons immigrating to the United States for "economic" reasons have strong
incentives to devote a large fraction of their effort to the process of accumu-

lating U.S.-specific human capital skills.1 This investment process explains
the relatively rapid rates of growth in immigrant earnings observed in cross-

-4-

sections, and combined with assumptions about how the immigration decision
leads to a relatively select group of immigrants, also explains the existence
of the overtaking age.

A large literature developed following the appearance of Chiswick's

study. This literature borrows both the theoretical framework and the

empirical

methodology of Chiswick's original work. The studies in Borjas (1982), Borjas
and Tienda (1985), Carliner (1980), De Freitas (1979), Long (1980), and others,
essentially expand the literature by analyzing both male and female immigrants,
by studying alternative data sets (such as the 1976 Survey of Income and Education), and by focusing on specific immigrant populations (e.g., Hispanics or

Asians). These various studies tend to confirm the robustness of the results
in cross-section analyses of the problem, and their cumulative impact has led
to the current conventional wisdom that after 10-15 years immigrants do
extremely well in the U.S. labor market.
The analysis presented in this paper questions the empirical validity of

this conclusion. Using the 1970 and 1980 Public Use Samples from the U.S.
Census, the analysis shows that the cross-section regressions commonly used
in the literature confound the true assimilation impact with possible quality

differentials among immigrant cohorts. The empirical analysis below shows
that the study of earnings within immigrant cohorts leads to a very different
picture of the rate of assimilation of immigrants into the U.S. labor market.
Instead of the rapid growth found by the cross-section studies, the cohort
analysis predicts relatively slow rates of earnings growth for most immigrant

groups. The direct comparison of immigrant cohorts in the 1970 and 1980
Census data shows that the strong assimilation rates measured in the crosssection may be partly due to a precipitous decline that has occurred in the

quality of immigrants admitted to this country since 1950. Thus the positive

-5—

impact of the years-since-migration variable
tions captures both the higher
the increase in U.S. -Specific

the cohort analysis indicates

in cross-section earnings equa-

quality of earlier immigrant cohorts as well as

capital hypothesized in the literature.

Finally,

that, for most immigrant groups, the overtaking

point takes place much later in the life cycle (if at all) than the point
predicted by the cross-section regression.2
Section II of the paper presents the

conceptual framework allowing the

identification of the assimilation and cohort effects in census data, This
methodology is applied in Section III to the
in Section IV to the study of the

study of immigrant earnings, and

earnings of immigrants relative to the

native-born. Finally, Section V summarizes the results of the Study.

II. Framework
The economic analysis of how immigrant earnings respond to the assimilation process is commonly based on the results obtained from the following
cross-section model:

ln w.

1

X.X +
1

t.

1

+

c.1

(1)

where w. is the wage rate of immigrant i; X. is
a vector of his socioeconomic
characteristics (e.g., years of completed schooling, years of labor market
experience, etc.); and t. measures how long immigrant 1. has been in the United
3
States.

Since total labor market experience

(i.e., Age-Education-6) is usually

included as one of the regressors in (1), the coefficient

differential

measures the

value placed by the U.S. labor market between U.S. experience

and foreign experience. As was noted in the introduction, one of the most
important findings of the cross-section literature is that

is significantly

positive. Thus the U.S. labor market rewards U.S. experience at a higher
rate than it rewards foreign experience. The economic interpretation of
this finding is usually couched in terms of the human capital framework.
When immigrants first arrive in the United States they lack U.S. -specific
human capital, and this results in relatively low earnings upon entrance to

the labor market. In order for the costs of immigration to be recouped, the
immigrant rapidly begins an investment path with high levels of investment

costs. These high levels of human capital investments further depress the
current earnings of recent immigrants, but guarantee high rates of growth in

earnings as the immigrants "assimilate" into the U.S. labor market. Thus the
positive and significant

obtained in cross—section estimates of equation (1)

captures how earnings grow with the assimilation process.

The fallacy with this interpretation lies in its use of a cross-section

regression model to explain a dynamic series of events. There are (at least)
two obvious factors which can seriously bias cross-section estimates of
and raise serious doubts about the conclusion that the earnings of immigrants

rise rapidly as they assimilate, The first of these problems (and one about
which little can be done with currently available data) arises from the fact
that many immigrants eventually return to their country of origin. Piore
(1979), for example, estimates that over 30 percent of the immigrants admitted

into the United States in the early 1900's emigrated back to their country of

origin. Similarly, Warren and Peck (1980), using the 1960 and 1970 Census,
estimate that 18 percent of immigrants admitted to the U.S. between 1960 and

1970 had emigrated by 1970. Since the incidence of emigration is not likely
to be a random process in the, immigrant population, potentially serious sel-

ection biases can affect the cross-section estimate of .

For example, if

immigrants who do not do well in the United States are more likely to emigrate,
the coefficient

will be biased upward since earlier cohorts of immigrants

—7—

will have been self-selected to include only the most successful immigrants,
while the recent cohorts contain a more representative selection of the

immigrant pool. It is unfortunate that, despite the potential importance of
this problem, the complete lack of emigration data for the United States
implies that any analysis of this issue (even the simple counting of how many
emigrants there are) requires the making of many unverifiable statistical and
institutional assumptions.4
The second problem with the dynamic interpretation of the cross-section
coefficient

is its implicit assumption that, abstracting from the emigration

problem, the average tIqualityt of successive cohorts of immigrants is not

changing over time. It is this stationarity assumption which permits the
inference that since the cross-section regression indicates that a recently

arrived immigrant earns (10)iOo percent less than one who arrived 10 years
earlier, it follows that the earnings of recently arrived immigrants will

increase by (10).iOO percent in the next decade (net of aging effects).
Note that the direction of the bias if the stationarity assumption is
not empirically valid depends on the secular trend in the quality of the

immigrant cohorts admitted to the United States. If, for example, institutional changes in immigration policies and/or political disturbances in sending
countries lead to higher quality immigration, the cross-section estimate of

would be downward biased. If, on the other hand, the shift from occupational
to family preferences mandated by the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act and
the increase in unscreened illegal immigrants has lowered the average quality of
immigrant cohorts, the cross-section estimate of

would be upward biased, and

the impact of the assimilation process on the earnings of immigrants would be
overestimated.

-8-

It is likely that the rapid increase in immigration rates since 1950 has
violated the stringent requirements imposed by the stationarity assumption in

cross-section studies. Thus the estimates of equation (1) are likely to suffer
from serious biases. To derive a general framework for comparing the crosssection results with the findings obtained from within-cohort analyses, con-

sider the group of immigrants aged 18—54 in 1970. Using the 1970 Census, it
is convenient to partition this group into four cohorts: arrivals in 19651969, arrivals in 1960-1964, arrivals in 1950—1959, and immigrants who arrived

prior to 1950. Consider next the group of immigrants aged 28-64 in the 1980
Census. The 1980 Census data allows the partitioning of this group of immigrants into six cohorts: arrivals in 1975-1979, arrivals in 1970-1974,
arrivals in 1965-1969, arrivals in 1960—1964, arrivals in 1950-1959, and

immigrants who arrived prior to 1950. Note that the last four cohorts defined
in the 1980 group exactly match the definitions of the cohorts from the 1970

Census. In addition, the age composition of the two samples ensures that
(if the census data contained all observations from the population) the same

individuals are included in each of these cohort samples.5 Given these data,

two cross—section regressions can be estimat:

nition, the vector X in (2) and (3) does not contain a constant term.
Consider cohort k, where Dk = 1 (k=40,50,60,65). Let k give the mean
values of the socioeconomic characteristics for this cohort as of 1980. Define:

(6)

Equations (4) and (5) give the predicted (ln) earnings of the average member
of cohort k in 1970 and 1980,

respectively. Equation (6) gives the predicted

(in) earnings in 1980 for the cohort who arrived 10 years after cohort k.

Note that, by definition, as of 1970 cohort k has been in the U.S., say, j

years.

As of 1980, cohort k+10 has also been in the U.S. j

years.

Thus the

comparison of these two cohorts across censuses holds constant the number of
years since immigration.

Using the definitions in (4)-(6), the 1980 regression predicts that over
10 years, the cross-section growth for cohort k (net of aging) is given by:6

80k - 80k+lo

-

k+10

(fl

The cross-section growth given by (7) can be rewritten a:

80,k 8O,k+1O =

8o,k;7o,k

+

(8)

Equation (8) decomposes the cross-section growth into two parts. The first ters

in

(8) gives the earnings growth experienced by cohort k over the decade, and

- 10—

will be called the "within-cohort" growth. The second term in (8) estimates the
difference in earnings which occurred over the decade for individuals with a

given number of years since immigration. Thus it compares different cohorts
at the same point of their U.S. life cycle and will be called the "across-cohort"

earnings growth. If, for example, the quality of cohorts is declining over time,
the earnings of immigrants who have been in the U.S. j years will decline across

censuses. Thus the second term in (8) is positive, upwardly biasing the crosssection measure of earnings growth. Equation (8), therefore, illustrates a very
useful result: the comparison of immigrant cross-sections over time can be used
to infer the extent to which the underlying quality of immigrant cohorts is
changing.

It is important to note that, although as equation (8) shows, the crosssection growth is biased by the existence of quality differentials across
cohorts, the within-cohort growth can also be biased by the effect of secular

changes in aggregate labor market conditions. For example, if economic conditions worsened between 1970 and 1980, the within-cohort growth in (8) will
be biased downwards, and the decomposition in (8) will exaggerate the extent

of quality differences across cohorts. One possible solution to this problem
is simply to analyze the behavior of immigrant earnings relative to a base of

native-born workers. Suppose the wage structures for native-born workers are
given by:

mw70,n
ln W80n =

Xô70 +c n,

(9)

+

(10)

Xo80

where the subscript "n" indicates native-born status. Define the earnings a
native-born worker statistically similar to the average immigrant from cohort k
would earn by:

—11—

70,n XkÔ7O +
80,n =

XkÔgO

+

(ii)

.

(12)

Note that the cross-section growth in the relative earnings of immigrant cohort
k is given by:

8O,k+1080,n

k+1O

(13)

Thus the estimate of cross-section growth is unaffected by the introduction of

the native-born into the analysis.8 Equation (13) can be decomposed into:

-

k+1O

=

8O,k8O,n

-

+ E(Y70,kY70,n)

80,k+1080,)L

(14)

The first bracketed term in (14) gives the difference in the relative earnings

of cohort k between 1980 and 1970. This within-cohort effect measures the rate
at which the earnings profiles of the immigrant-born and the native-born are

converging (or diverging). The second bracketed term

in

(14), as

before,

gives

the across-cohort effect. It estimates the difference in the relative earnings
of immigrants who are at the same position in their U.S. life cycle between 1970

and 1980. If this difference is positive, the across-cohort growth indicates
that, relative to the native-born base, the quality of immigrants is falling
over time, upwardly biasing the cross-section growth in immigrant earnings.
Finally, it should be noted that the statistical framework leading to
equations (8) and (14) is

rather

general. By allowing the socioeconomic vector

X to have a different effect between the native-born and the foreign-born, and
across different time periods, the biases introduced by invalid restrictions

—12-

on the coefficients are avoided. It turns out that in the census data analyzed
below, the large sample sizes used led to the rejection of equality constraints
on these coefficients for practically all immigrant and native groups.
III. The Earnings of Immigrants
The data used in the analysis are drawn from the 1970 1/100 Public Use
Sample from the U.S. Census (5 percent SMSA and County Group Sample), and the
1980 A Sample from the U.S. Census (a 5 percent random sample of the population).
Due to the very large sample sizes in these data sets, random samples were
drawn for some of the larger groups (e.g., white natives in both 1970 and
1980, black natives in 1980, etc.).9
The analysis is restricted to male persons aged 18-54 in 1970 and 28—64

in 1980. The four sample selection rules used in both Censuses are:

(1) the

individual is not self-employed or working without pay; (2) the individual is
not in the Armed Forces (as of the Census week); (3) the individual does not
reside in group quarters; and (4) the individual's record can be used to

calculate the 1969 or 1979 wage rate.'° Since previous research has shown
that major differences in economic status exist within the male immigrant (and
native) labor force, the study will be conducted separately for each of the
six major immigrant groups: Ilexican (18.0 percent of the male immigrant
population as of 1980), Cuban (5.3 percent), other Hispanic (9.7 percent),
Asian (15.9 percent), white (45.4 percent), and black (5.7 percent), where the
"white" and "black" immigrant samples contain the observations which are

neither Hispanic nor Asian.11 Table 1 presents the means of basic economic
characteristics for the cohorts in each of the immigrant samples, and for

their native-born male counterparts. The table presents the mean (ln) wage
rate (WAGE), the mean completed years of schooling (EDUC), the average age of
the group, as well as the number of observations in the sample (N). Throughout

-13-

the paper the 1979 wage rate has been deflated to 1969 levels by using the

Consumer Price Index. Table 1 illustrates the well known facts that major
differences in these socioeconomic characteristics exist both between native
and immigrant groups, as well as within each of these populations across
national groups.

The empirical analysis reported throughout the paper is based on the

estimates of equations (2), (3), (9), and (10): the two immigrant crosssections and the two native-born cross-sections. To allow the testing of coefficients across these equations, the four equations were estImated jointly.

The Appendix to this paper presents the complete set of regressions used in

the analysis: Table Al provides a description of the variables used in the
regression; Table A2 presents the estimated regressions; and Table A3 presents the means of the socioeconomic characteristics used in the decomposition

of cross—section effects into its within— and across-cohort components. The
vector of socioeconomic characteristics, X, in the Cross-section regressions

includes the variables: years of completed schooling; years of labor market
experience (defined by Age-Schooling-6); years of labor market experience squared;
whether or not health limits work; whether or not married, spouse present; and

whether or not the individual resides in an SMSA.12 The dependent variable is
the 1969 or 1979 (ln) wage rate.

13

In this section the discussion will focus on the estimates of the immigrant

cross-sections (2) and (3). To provide comparability between these results and
the literature, Table 2 presents the coefficients of the years-since-migration
variable obtained from the 1980 cross-section for each of the six national
groups. The omitted dummy variable in the table is D75 (arrivals in 1975-79).,
so that all coefficients in Table 2 measure wage differentials between earlier

immigrant cohorts and their most recent counterparts. The results in Table 2

-14-

tend to mimic those presented in the literature:

with relatively minor excep-

tions, the earnings of immigrants who have been in the U.S. many years are

significantly higher than the earnings of recent arrivals. For example, Asian
immigrants who arrived in the early 1970's report about 17 percent higher earnings than the most recent Asian arrivals in the 1980 Census.

This differential

increases to over 30 percent for the Asian immigrants who arrived in the early
1960's, and to over 40 percent for the Asians who immigrated prior to 1950.
Similar qualitative conclusions can be drawn for practically all national groups.
Thus the 1980 cross-section regressions in the

immigrant samples, if anything,

indicate the robustness of the years-since-migration variable in cross-section
regressions.

The analysis in the previous section, as summarized by equation (8), shows

how the growth implicit in the cross-section estimates of Table 2 can be decomposed into a within-cohort growth and an across—cohort growth. This decomposition is carried out in Table 3 for each of three cohorts which can be matched

exactly in the 1970 and 1980 Census files: arrivals in

1965—1969, 1960-1964, and

1950— 1959.14

Perhaps the best way to understand Table 3 is to illustrate its derivation

through an example. Consider the group of white immigrants who arrived in the

U.S. during the 1965-1969 period. As Table 2 shows, these individuals earn
roughly 7.0 percent more than the most recent arrivals (i.e., white men who

immigrated in 1975-1979). Thus the cross-section analysis predicts that over
a 10-year period the 1965-69 immigrants will have increased their earnings by

7.0 percent. However, if we compare the earnings of this cohort in 1970 and
1980, as measured by the first term in (8), the cohort actually experienced

an insignificant increase in earnings of about .6 percent. The difference
between the cross-section growth and the within cohort growth is 6.4 percent.

—15—

This differential indicates that recently arrived immigrants in 1970 had 6.4
percent higher earnings than recently arrived immigrants in 1980, and may be
indicative of a drop in quality across immigrant cohorts. Thus the decomposition of the cross-section growth predicted for this immigrant cohort indicates
that, in fact, the cohort experienced no earnings growth over the decade, and
that the entire cross-section growth is

explained by earnings differences across

immigrant cohorts.

The remaining rows of Table 3 replicate this analysis for all other cohorts

in the six immigrant groups. The major finding obtained from these results is
that there are significant differences in the within-cohort growth experienced
by immigrants both within a national group, and across national groups. The
latter fact is illustrated by the result that within-cohort growth is overwhelmingly negative for white and black immigrants, but is

overwhelmingly

positive for Asian, Mexican, and Cuban immigrants. Thus there

are strong racial!

ethnic differences in the rate at which the earnings of immigrant cohorts actually

increased over the 1970-1980 period. Note also that the across-cohort growth is
positive in 16 out of 18 cases, and has a t-ratio exceeding 1.5 in 12 out of 18

cases. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the quality of
immigrants has declined over succeeding immigrant cohorts. It is, in fact,
interesting to note that the only important negative (but insignificant)
across-cohort effect, indicating that the quality of immigrants increased
over time, is obtained in the row for Cuban immigrants who arrived in 1950-1959.
The across-cohort effect in this case measures how these arrivals compare with

the Cubans who arrived in 1960-1969. The increase in

quality suggested by Table 3

is consistent with the hypothesis that the 1959 political upheaval in Cuba led to
the outflow of "better" Cuban immigrants in the first few years of the postrevolution period.

IV.

The Relative Earnings of Immigrants
As was pointed out earlier, the decomposition of the cross-section growth

in Table 3 into the within-cohort and across-cohort components is itself not

free of bias. If labor market conditions worsened sufficiently between 1969
and 1979, the within-cohort growth of immigrants will be depressed by the fall
in the aggregate wage level, and the across-cohort quality change will be

exaggerated. It is important to note, however, that the evidence in Table 3
suggests that this cannot be the only reason for the difference between cross-

section and within-cohort effects. In particular, if the fall in aggregate
wage levels was neutral across immigrant cohorts and national groups, the
results in Table 3 indicate that since some immigrant national groups and/or
some cohorts within each group did fare quite well during the 1970-1980
period, the relative differences in the results across the 18 cohorts do
measure the variance in the within-cohort growth and the secular quality
change among immigrant cohorts.

The analysis in Section II suggested that a simple way of netting out the
influence of the fall in aggregate demand from the estimates was to decompose
the cross-section growth in immigrant earnings relative to the native-born base.
One of the most remarkable findings of the cross-section literature on the realtive earnings of immigrants is the existence of an overtaking age, at which point
immigrants' earnings begin to surpass the earnings of statistically similar

native-born workers. This overtaking point has been dated at between 10-15
years after immigration for some immigrant groups.
Before proceeding to the decomposition of the relative change in immigrant
earnings over the 1970-1980 period, it is useful to provide a set of results

comparable to those found in the literature. Table 4 presents the difference
between the 1980 (ln) earnings of statistically similar immigrants and nativeborn workers, evaluated at the mean level of the socioeconomic characteristics

—i7..

of the immigrant cohort. 15
group -

the

native-born -

It should be noted that the choice of the reference

is

somewhat arbitrary since the immigrants can either

be compared to the white native-born population or to the immigrants' nationality

counterparts in the native-born population (i,e. Mexican immigrants would be
compared to Mexican/American native-born men, black immigrants to black native-

born men, etc.). Both of these strategies were pursued and since the possibility
of overtaking the white native-born population was quite low for most of the
immigrant groups, the analysis is presented using the latter alternative.

That is, each immigrant group is compared to its native-born counterpart.16
The results in Table 4 are consistent with

the findings reported in the

literature: the earnings of white immigrants overtake the earnings of statistically comparable white native-born workers within 10—15 years after immigration.

17

All other immigrant groups, however, have slower rates of convergence,

even though the other groups are not being compared to the white native-born
base.

Equation (14) presents the methodology by

which the cross-section rates of

convergence can be decomposed into withincchort and across-cohort changes in

relative

18

earnings.

.

..

.

This decomposition is given in Table 5.

example, the results for Mexican immigrants who arrived in

Lonsider, for

1965-1969. According

to the cross-secUon, relative to the Mexicn rativc'born, the wage of these
immigrants increases about 32 percent within the first 10 years after immigration.
Note, however, that the cohort actually experienced an increase of only 18.8 percent in their relative earnings during their first decade in the U.S. The difference between these two growth rates, about 13.2 percent, is the across-cohort
growth and indicates that recent Mexican immigrants in 1970 did 13.2 percent
better (relative to Mexican natives) than rece.rt Mexican immigrants in 1980.

Thus relative to the Mexican native-born population, the result in Table 5
indicates that the relative quality of Mexican immigrants may have declined
over time.

-18-

An additional implication of this result is that the cross-section growth
underestimates the number of years that it will take the recent Mexican immi-

grants to overtake their statistically similar native-born counterparts. Since
the earnings profiles of the Mexican native and foreign-born men are converging
at relatively slow rates, the overtaking point is delayed considerably.
The remaining rows of Table 5 indicate that practically all the immigrant
cohorts being analyzed experienced strong relative earnings growth over a 10-

year period according to the cross-section results. The within-cohort analysis,
however, shows that improvements in the relative earnings of immigrants is

concentrated within specific race/ethnic groups. For example, the groups of
white, Asian, and Mexican immigrants generally exhibit strong rates of conver-

gence between immigrant and native-born earnings profiles. On the other hand,
the results for blacks and Cubans show either little change in the relative
earnings of immigrants or a deterioration in their relative earnings over the
1970-1980 decade.

The results in Table 5 also show that the rate of growth in relative
immigrant earnings given by the cross-section analysis often exceeds the actual

rate of growth experienced by the immigrant cohort. The across-cohort growth
is positive and has a t-statistic exceeding 1.5 in 10 of the 18 cohorts under

analysis. These positive across-cohort effects state that, for the same number
of years in the U.S., immigrants in earlier cohorts do better (relative to

natives) than immigrants in more recent cohorts. Thus the results in Table 5
are again consistent with the hypothesis that the quality of immigrant cohorts
has been falling over time for many immigrant groups.
It can, of course, be argued that the across-cohort effects are only
capturing the fall in demand for immigrant labor that presumably occurred

during the 1970s. This argument, however, is not sufficient to explain the
results in Table 5 since the variation in across-cohort effects across and

—19—

within immigrant groups is quite large. For example, why are the acrosscohort changes larger for black and Cuban immigrants than they are for white

and Asian immigrants? Further, why are the across-cohort effects so different
within specific groups? In the white sample, for instance, two of the acrosscohort effects are negative (and insignificant), while one is significantly

positive and numerically large. The demand shift hypothesis cannot explain
these variations unless it is also argued that demand varied

systematically

not only across national groups, but also within national groups according to

the years-since-migration. Finally, the demand shift hypothesis must also
assume that the demand for immigrant labor declined relative to the demand

for native-born labor. The evidence on any of these assumptions is, at
present, nonexistent.
The results in Tables 3 and 5, therefore, raise important doubts about
the validity of the inference drawn from cross-section studies that immigrants

"assimilate" rapidly in the U.S. labor market. It is important to note that
these effects, by focusing solely on the years-since-migration variable, are

measuring the impact of assimilation net of aging effects. The effect of
aging on the relative earnings of immigrants would not be very important if
the age coefficients (more precisely, the coefficients of potential labor
market experience) were roughly similar in the native-born and foreign-born

earnings functions. The regressions in Appendix Table A2, however, suggest
that this is not the case. Thus it is worthwhile to conclude the analysis
by presenting estimates of the change in the relative wage of immigrants over
a 10 year period due solely to the fact that the men are 10 years older in
1980 than in 1970.

Using the 1980 cross-section regression in equation (3), the earnings

of immigrants in a particular cohort with T
experience can be defined by:

years of potential labor market

-20-

= ZO + p.T + X.T2

(15)

,

where Z is the vector of all the socioeconomic characteristics except for

4

experience and experience squared, and the subscript "i" indicates that the
parameters are drawn from the cross-section regression estimated in the im-

migrant sample. The predicted earnings for an immigrant who is 10 years
younger, holding all other factors constant, is given by:

+ p(T-l0)

=

+

X.(T-lo)2.

(16)

Thus the change in immigrant earnings due solely to the aging of the immigrant
over the decade is:

=

lop.

+ A. (20T-l00).

(17)

Using the 1980 cross-section estimated in the sample of the native-born
leads, of course, to a similar expression for the aging effect experienced by
statistically similar native—born men:

=

lop

+ A

(20T-100).

(18)

Hence the change in the relative earnings of immigrants due purely to aging
is given by:

=

lO(p.-p)

+.

(A.-A)(20T-loo).

(19)

Equation (19) illustrates the obvious fact that the relative earnings of
immigrants are affected by aging only if the coefficients of the age variables differ between the immigrant and native-born earnings functions.

-21-

Table 6 presents the estimated aging effects, as defined by equation (19),

for each ofthe 18 cohorts under analysis. The obvious implication of these
results is that for four of the six immigrant groups, pure aging effects lead
to a deterioration of the relative earnings of immigrants over time. This
deterioration is not only statistically significant but is also numerically

important. For example, the fact that the immigrant men are 10 years older
in 1980 than in 1970 lowers the relative earnings of Asians by 15-17 percent,
lowers the relative earnings of Mexicans by 7.5 percent, lowers the relative
earnings of Cubans by 10-12 percent, and lowers the relative earnings of

other Hispanics by 10-11 percent. If these quantities are added to the withincohort assimilation effects presented in Table 5, it quickly becomes apparent
that, in fact, the relative earnings of immigrants, as a result of relatively
low assimilation rates and detrimental aging effects, simply did not increase
very much in the 1970-1980 decade.

The other two immigrant groups -

whites

and blacks - have aging effects

which are positive, but generally insignificant. Only one of the six aging
effects estimated for these two groups has a t-ratio exceeding 1.5. Moreover,
in the case of whites the impact of aging on the relative earnings of immigrants

is numerically trivial. Thus Table 6 reveals that the pure impact of aging
seldom works in favor of the immigrants and, in fact, often works to their
detriment.

V.

Summary
This paper has conducted a reexamination of the empirical basis for two

"facts" concerning immigrant wage growth which seem to be found in most cross-

section empirical studies of the problem: (1) the earnings of immigrants grow
rapidly as they assimilate into the United States; and (2) this rapid growth
also leads to immigrants overtaking the earnings of the native-born within 10-15
years after arrival.

—22-

The study in this paper stresses the differences between cross-section and

cohort analyses of earnings determination. In particular, cross-section studies
of immigrant earnings growth confound the true assimilation impact with across-

cohort changes in immigrant quality. The analysis of 18 specific immigrant cohorts
in the 1970 and 1980 Public Use Samples of the U.S. Census led to three major
results:
1.

The earnings of a cohort of immigrants grow at a much slower rate than

that predicted by cross-section studies. Over the 1970-1980 decade, the crosssection regression overestimated the true rate of growth experienced by- immigrants
by as much as 20 percentage points in some immigrant cohorts.
2.

The earnings growth of immigrant cohorts relative to the native-born

are again greatly overestimated by cross-section analysis. The empirical study
of specific immigrant cohorts shows that the relative earnings of many of these
cohorts experienced little change, or even a slight decline, over the 1970-1980
period even though the cross-section regression predicts rapid growth in the
relative earnings of immigrants.
3.

These results imply that the across-cohort change in immigrant earnings

is quite significant, with earlier cohorts earning more at every point of their

U.S. labor market career than more recent cohorts. Although part of this acrosscohort result may be due to a hypothesized fall in demand for immigrant labor,
the results are also consistent with the hypothesis that the quality of immigrant
cohorts has experienced a secular decline.
The analysis in this paper, therefore, raises serious questions about the
economic interpretation of immigrant behavior in the labor market and about the
policy question of what is the contribution of immigrants to the United States.
The main lesson of this paper, however, is that cross-section studies of immigrant
earnings provide few, and misleading, insights into the process of how immigrants

assimilate in the labor market. More generally, the results of the cohort analysis

-23-

make it clear that an understanding of the immigrant experience in the U.S. cannot

be obtained in a vacuum free of an institutional framework. The immigration
experience cannot be understood without the introduction into the model of the
parameters of admission policies, the recurring political and economic upheavals
in sending countries, and the shifts in labor demand for native- and foreign-born

labor. The study of immigrant earnings, within this institutional framework,
will surely lead to a much deeper understanding of the immigration experience.

*Professor of Economics, University of California, Santa Barbara, and

Research Associate, National Bureau of Economic Research. I am grateful to
Barry Chiswick, Daniel Hamermesh, Jacob Mincer, Marta Tienda, and Robert Topel
for comments made on a previous draft of this paper, and to Bill Gould for

providing me with a test version of STATA. This research was supported by
grants from the Rockefeller Foundation and the Department of Health and Human

Services. Of course, I alone am responsible for the contents of this paper.

1This argument can also be made for the so-called "non-economic's immigrants
(e.g., political refugees); see Borjas (1982).

2Although the cohort analysis of earnings conducted in this paper is not
available in the literature, a few previous studies have addressed issues

related to those discussed below. For example, Chiswick (1984) has analyzed
the earnings growth of the small sample of immigrants available in the Mature

Men National Longitudinal Survey. Similarly, both Chiswick (1980, Chapter 10)
and DeFreitas (1981) have used the 1965 and 1970 occupation variables available
in the 1970 Census to study the extent of occupational mobility in immigrant

samples. The results of these studies, however, do not provide a consensus
on whether or not longitudinal data leads to different results than cross-

section data. In the studies of occupational mobility, for example, Chiswick
finds relatively higher rates of.upward mobility as immigrants assimilate in
the labor market, while DeFreitas, in his analysis of black men, finds either
no difference between the native-born and the foreign-born or slower rates of

upward mobility for the foreign-born. In addition, the study of the longitudinal National Chicano Survey by Snipp and Tienda (1984) finds no evidence
that Mexican immigrants experience relatively more upward occupational mobility
than native-born Mexican/Americans.

-31-

31n some studies, t. is defined as a vector of variables indicating the
time period in which the immigrant arrived rather than a Continuous variable

measuring years since migration. The simpler specification is used in the
discussion to focus attention on the substantive problems introduced by crosssection data.

simple calculation of the magnitude of the bias could, in principle,
be based on the fact that some immigrants (e.g., political refugees) have no
possibility for return migration, while other immigrants (e.g., Mexicans)

face low return costs due to geographic circumstances. This kind of solution,
however, would have to take into account the differences in observable (and
unobservable) quality indeces among the national groups.

50f course, there are many reasons why the cohorts in the 1970 and 1980

Census data may not be perfectly matched. For instance, as noted earlier,
the presence of emigration will lead to secular trends in the size (and

quality) of a specific immigrant cohort. Similarly, institutional changes
in the Census enumeration procedures may lead to different counts of immigrants

(and native-born persons) in particular cohorts across Censuses. Finally,
there may be age (or cohort) related diff€rences in labor supply, selfemployment propensities, and mortality rates which generate additional
differences in the cohort samples included in the regressions over time.

Note, however, that all these problems will impart biases on both cross-

section and cohort analyses. Hence the cohort study presented below simply
nets out one of the many sources of bias, that due to violations of the
assumption of stationarity in the immigrant human capital stock at the time of entry.

-32-

6Equation (7) defines the cross—section growth exactly for all but one

of the cohorts in the data. In particular, consider the cohort which arrived

in 1950-1959. Since the 1960 cohorts are partitioned into 2 groups, the definition for cross-section growth used for this sample is given by:

-

8O,6O

_50 - 6065
2

so that a simple average is used to pooi the two coefficients from the 1960's.

7me decomposition of the cross-section growth into its components can
also be made by pooling the 1970 and 1980 observations for a specific cohort,
and including a dummy variable in the earnings function indicating the census

from which the observation is drawn. It is easy to show that this methodology
is identical to that given by equation (8) as long as the y coefficient vector
is allowed to vary across censuses but is fixed for all cohorts within a
census.

80f course, this result follows directly from the fact that all the pre-

dicted earnings terms are evaluated at a given level of socioeconomic characteristics, Xk, so that the decompositions in this section are net of any

pure aging effects. The empirical analysis below will present separate
estimates of the earnings differentials created by the aging process.

9The sampling fractions for 1970 are: white native-born (.001 of the popu-

lation), all other groups (.01). The 1980 sampling fractions are: black natives
(.00245), black immigrants (.01651), Mexican natives (.01652), Mexican immigrants
(.01638), white natives (.00042), white immigrants (.00249), all other groups
(.05).

'0As was noted earlier there are many reasons why in actual Census data
the 1970 and 1980 cohorts of immigrant (and native-born) men are not exactly

matched. In fact, the ratio of the number of immigrants in the 1980 sample
to that of the 1970 sample is 1.12. The value of the same ratio for native-

born men is 1.07. Thus the restriction of the sample to salaried men in
the labor force -

along with the age restrictions imposed on the two samples -

leads to an increase in sample size over the decade. The increase in
sample
size, however, is relatively neutral for immigrants and native-born men since
in the 1970 data 4.4 percent of the sample is foreign-born, while the same
statistic in the 1980 data is 4.6 percent.

UTwo points should be made about this ethnic/racial breakdown. First,
the Asian sample aggregates over a wide variety of countries and cultures;
hence the results for the Asian sample should be interpreted cautiously.
Second, the Hispanic samples do not include the group of Puerto Rican men
since Puerto Ricans born in Puerto Rico are not asked the year they migrated
to the U.S. by the Census,

12Since most immigrants reside within an SMSA, the analysis was also con-

ducted on the subsample of metropolitan residents, This estimation led to only
minor changes in the results.

13

The calculation of the 1969 wage rate uses the weekly hours worked
reported for the Census week, while the estimated 1979 wage rate uses the
usual hours worked per week in 1979.

'4The cohort arriving prior to 1950 can also be matched in the two census

data files. The open—ended lower interval, however, leads to the aggregation of
immigrants from many different cohorts, and thus confuses the basic issues.

-34-

'5More precisely, using the notation in Section II, the statistics

presented in Table 4 are given by 8O,k8O,n

has been suggested that a more relevant base group would be the

sample of native-born young men. Since immigrants are new entrants to the
labor market, their experiences are likely to resemble those encountered by
native-born youths. This, comparison, however, ignores the fact that, for
example, the 1960-1964 cohort of white immigrants has been in the U.S. for

17 years and is, onthe average, 43.5 years old. Thus the comparison of this
group with teenage workers would be quite misleading.

17An important implication of the hypothesis that there has been a secular
decline in the quality of immigrants is that overtaking will occur at a later

point in the life cycle in the 1980 Census than in the 1970 Census. The result
in Table 4 that white immigrants in 1980 overtake the native-born after 10-15
years seems to contradict this implication since Chiswick (1978) dates over-

taking at the same point using the 1970 Census. However, the definitions of
ttwhiteet men vary significantly across the two studies; in this paper a dis-

tinction is made between Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic whites. In fact,
given that the samples are defined identically in the two Censuses the resuits do show that overtaking occurs at a later point in the 1980 Census.

For example, a regression estimated in the 1970 Census using a pooled sample
of white native and immigrant men yields:

w = Xy - .0468D65 + .0626D60 + .0603D50 + .0479D40, R2
(—1.18)
(1.38)
(2.11)
(1.49)

.205,

where the omitted dummy variable indicates native-born status. This 1970
regression implies that among white men overtaking occurs within 5-10 ye&rs

-35-

after arrival in the U.S., while the 1980 results in Table 4 reveal that

overtaking (in the same racial/ethnic sample) occurs within 1015 year

after immigration. Thus over a 10 year period the overtaking age increased
by 5 years, a movement consistent with the hypothesis that the quality of
white immigrants has declined over time.

18The astute readerwil]. realize that the cross-section rates of convergence implicit in Table 4 are not identical to those given by equation (13).
The reason is that in Table 4 the comparison between each immigrant cohort
and the native-born population is calculated at the mean level of X for each
immigrant cohort, whereas the conceptually correct cross-section growth in
equation (13) holds constant the values of the socioeconomic characteristics

across cohorts. The reader can verify that the differences between the two
experiments are minimal.
