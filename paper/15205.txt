Dynamic Trading with Predictable Returns and Transaction Costs
Nicolae B. Garleanu and Lasse H. Pedersen
NBER Working Paper No. 15205
August 2009
JEL No. G11,G12
ABSTRACT
We derive a closed-form optimal dynamic portfolio policy when trading is costly and security returns
are predictable by signals with different mean-reversion speeds. The optimal strategy is characterized
by two principles: 1) aim in front of the target and 2) trade partially towards the current aim. Specifically,
the optimal updated portfolio is a linear combination of the existing portfolio and an "aim portfolio,"
which is a weighted average of the current Markowitz portfolio (the moving target) and the expected
Markowitz portfolios on all future dates (where the target is moving). Intuitively, predictors with slower
mean reversion (alpha decay) get more weight in the aim portfolio. We implement the optimal strategy
for commodity futures and find superior net returns relative to more naive benchmarks.

Active investors and asset managers — such as hedge funds, mutual funds, and proprietary traders — try to predict security returns and trade to profit from their predictions.
Such dynamic trading often entails significant turnover and transaction costs. Hence, any
active investor must constantly weigh the expected benefit of trading against its costs and
risks. An investor often uses different return predictors, e.g., value and momentum predictors, and these have different prediction strengths and mean-reversion speeds, or, said
differently, different “alphas” and “alpha decays.” The alpha decay is important because it
determines how long the investor can enjoy high expected returns and, therefore, affects the
trade-off between returns and transactions costs. For instance, while a momentum signal
may predict that the IBM stock return will be high over the next month, a value signal
might predict that Cisco will perform well over the next year.
This paper addresses how the optimal trading strategy depends on securities’ current
expected returns, the evolution of expected returns in the future, their risks and correlations,
and their transaction costs. We present a closed-form solution for the optimal dynamic
portfolio strategy, giving rise to two principles: 1) aim in front of the target and 2) trade
partially towards the current aim.
To see the intuition for these portfolio principles, note that the investor would like to
keep his portfolio close to the optimal portfolio in the absence of transaction costs, which
we call the “Markowitz portfolio.” The Markowitz portfolio is a moving target, since the
return-predicting factors change over time. Due to transaction costs, it is obviously not
optimal to trade all the way to the target all the time. Hence, transaction costs make it
optimal to slow down trading and, interestingly, to modify the aim, thus not to trade directly
towards the current Markowitz portfolio. Indeed, the optimal strategy is to trade towards
an “aim portfolio,” which is a weighted average of the current Markowitz portfolio (the
moving target) and the expected Markowitz portfolios on all future dates (where the target
is moving).
While new to finance, these portfolio principles have close analogues in other fields such as
the guidance of missiles towards moving targets, shooting, and sports. For example, related

2

dynamic programming principles are used to guide missiles to an enemy airplane in so-called
“lead homing” systems. Similarly, hunters are reminded to “lead the duck” when aiming
their weapon.1 The most famous example from the sports world is perhaps the following
quote from the “great one”:
“A great hockey player skates to where the puck is going to be, not where it is.”
— Wayne Gretzky
Another way to state our portfolio principle is that the best new portfolio is a combination
of 1) the current portfolio (to reduce turnover), 2) the Markowitz portfolio (to partly get
the best current risk-return trade-off), and 3) the expected optimal portfolio in the future
(a dynamic effect).
Figure 1 illustrates this natural trading rule. The solid line illustrates the expected path [Figure 1]
of the Markowitz portfolio, starting with large positions in both security 1 and security 2,
and gradually converging towards its long-term mean (e.g., the market portfolio). The aim
portfolio is a weighted-average of the current and future Markowitz portfolios so it lies in
the “convex hull” of the solid line or, equivalently, between the current Markowitz portfolio
and the expected aim portfolio next period. The optimal new position is achieved by trading
partially towards this aim portfolio.
In this example, the curvature of the solid line means that the Markowitz position in
security 1 decays more slowly as the predictor that currently “likes” security 1 is more
persistent. Therefore, the aim portfolio has a larger position in security 1, and, consequently,
the optimal trade buys more shares in security 1 than it would otherwise. We show that it
is in fact a more general principle that predictors with slower mean reversion (alpha decay)
get more weight in the aim portfolio. An investor facing transaction costs should trade more
aggressively on persistent signals than on fast mean-reverting signals: the benefits from the
former accrue over longer periods, and are therefore larger.
The key role played by each return predictor’s mean reversion is an important implication
of our model. It arises because transaction costs imply that the investor cannot easily change
his portfolio and, therefore, must consider his optimal portfolio both now and in the future.
3

In contrast, absent transaction costs, the investor can re-optimize at no cost and needs to
consider only the current investment opportunities without regard to alpha decay.
Our specification of transaction costs is sufficiently rich to allow for both purely transitory
and persistent costs. Persistent transaction costs means that trading leads to a market
impact and this effect on prices persists for a while. Indeed, since we focus on marketimpact costs, it may be more realistic to consider such persistent effects, especially over
short time periods. We show that, with persistent transaction costs, the optimal strategy
remains to trade partially towards an aim portfolio and to aim in front of the target, though
the precise trading strategy is different and more involved.
Finally, we illustrate our results empirically in the context of commodity futures markets.
We use returns over the past five days, 12 months, and five years to predict returns. The
five-day signal is quickly mean reverting (fast alpha decay), the 12-month signal mean reverts
more slowly, whereas the five-year signal is the most persistent. We calculate the optimal
dynamic trading strategy taking transaction costs into account and compare its performance
to the optimal portfolio ignoring transaction costs and to a class of strategies that perform
static (one-period) transaction-cost optimization. Our optimal portfolio performs the best
net of transaction costs among all the strategies that we consider. Its net Sharpe ratio is
about 20% better than that of the best strategy among all the static strategies. Our strategy’s
superior performance is achieved by trading at an optimal speed and by trading towards an
aim portfolio that is optimally tilted towards the more persistent return predictors.
We also study the impulse-response of the security positions following a shock to return
predictors. While the no-transaction-cost position immediately jumps up and mean reverts
with the speed of the alpha decay, the optimal position increases more slowly to minimize
trading costs and, depending on the alpha decay speed, may eventually become larger than
the no-transaction-cost position, as the optimal position is reduced more slowly.
The paper is organized as follows. Section I describes how our paper contributes to
the portfolio-selection literature that started with Markowitz (1952). We provide a closedform solution for a model with multiple correlated securities and multiple return predictors

4

with different mean-reversion speeds. The closed-form solution illustrates several intuitive
portfolio principles that are difficult to see in the models following Constantinides (1986),
where the solution requires complex numerical techniques even with a single security and
no return predictors (i.i.d. returns). Indeed, we uncover the role of alpha decay and the
intuitive aim-in-front-of-the-target and trade-towards-the-aim principles, and our empirical
analysis suggests that these principles are useful.
Section II lays out the model with temporary transaction costs and lays out the solution method. Section III shows the optimality of aiming in front of the target, and trading
partially towards the aim. Section IV solves the model with persistent transaction costs.
Section V provides a number of theoretical applications, while Section VI applies our framework empirically to trading commodity futures. Section VII concludes, and all proofs are in
the appendix.

I. Related Literature
A large literature studies portfolio selection with return predictability in the absence of
trading costs (see, e.g., Campbell and Viceira (2002) and references therein). Alpha decay
plays no role in this literature, and nor does it play a role in the literature on optimal portfolio selection with trading costs but without return predictability following Constantinides
(1986).
This latter literature models transaction costs as proportional bid-ask spreads and relies
on numerical solutions. Constantinides (1986) considers a single risky asset in a partial equilibrium and studies trading-cost implications for the equity premium.2 Equilibrium models
with trading costs include Amihud and Mendelson (1986), Vayanos (1998), Vayanos and
Vila (1999), Lo, Mamaysky, and Wang (2004), and Gârleanu (2009), as well as Acharya and
Pedersen (2005), who also consider time-varying trading costs. Liu (2004) determines the
optimal trading strategy for an investor with constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) and
many independent securities with both fixed and proportional costs (without predictability). The assumptions of CARA and independence across securities imply that the optimal
5

position for each security is independent of the positions in the other securities.
Our trade-partially-towards-the-aim strategy is qualitatively different from the optimal
strategy with proportional or fixed transaction costs, which exhibits periods of no trading.
Our strategy mimics a trader who is continuously “floating” limit orders close to the midquote — a strategy that is used in practice. The trading speed (the limit orders’ “fill rate”
in our analogy) depends on how large transaction costs the trader is willing to accept (i.e.,
on where the limit orders are placed).
In a third (and most related) strand of literature, using calibrated numerical solutions,
trading costs are combined with incomplete markets by Heaton and Lucas (1996), and with
predictability and time-varying investment-opportunity sets by Balduzzi and Lynch (1999),
Lynch and Balduzzi (2000), Jang, Koo, Liu, and Loewenstein (2007), and Lynch and Tan
(2011). Grinold (2006) derives the optimal steady-state position with quadratic trading costs
and a single predictor of returns per security. Like Heaton and Lucas (1996) and Grinold
(2006), we also rely on quadratic trading costs.
A fourth strand of literature derives the optimal trade execution, treating the asset and
quantity to trade as given exogenously (see, e.g., Perold (1988), Bertsimas and Lo (1998),
Almgren and Chriss (2000), Obizhaeva and Wang (2006), and Engle and Ferstenberg (2007)).
Finally, quadratic programming techniques are also used in macroeconomics and other
fields, and, usually, the solution comes down to algebraic matrix Riccati equations (see,
e.g., Ljungqvist and Sargent (2004) and references therein). We solve our model explicitly,
including the Riccati equations.

II. Model and Solution
We consider an economy with S securities traded at each time t ∈ {0, 1, 2, ...}. The
securities’ price changes between times t and t + 1 in excess of the risk-free return, pt+1 −
(1 + rf )pt , are collected in an S × 1 vector rt+1 given by
rt+1 = Bft + ut+1 .

(1)
6

Here, ft is a K × 1 vector of factors that predict returns,3 B is an S × K matrix of factor
loadings, and ut+1 is the unpredictable zero-mean noise term with variance vart (ut+1 ) = Σ.
The return-predicting factor ft is known to the investor already at time t and it evolves
according to
∆ft+1 = −Φft + εt+1 ,

(2)

where ∆ft+1 = ft+1 − ft is the change in the factors, Φ is a K × K matrix of meanreversion coefficients for the factors, and εt+1 is the shock affecting the predictors with
variance vart (εt+1 ) = Ω. We impose on Φ standard conditions sufficient to ensure that f is
stationary.
The interpretation of these assumptions is straightforward: the investor analyzes the securities and his analysis results in forecasts of excess returns. The most direct interpretation
is that the investor regresses the return on security s on the factors f that could be past
returns over various horizons, valuation ratios, and other return-predicting variables, and
thus estimates each variable’s ability to predict returns as given by β sk (collected in the
matrix B). Alternatively, one can think of each factor as an analyst’s overall assessment of
the various securities (possibly based on a range of qualitative information) and B as the
strength of these assessments in predicting returns.
Trading is costly in this economy and the transaction cost (T C) associated with trading
∆xt = xt − xt−1 shares is given by
1
T C(∆xt ) = ∆x>
Λ∆xt ,
2 t

(3)

where Λ is a symmetric positive-definite matrix measuring the level of trading costs.4 Trading costs of this form can be thought of as follows. Trading ∆xt shares moves the (average)
price by 21 Λ∆xt , and this results in a total trading cost of ∆xt times the price move, which
gives T C. Hence, Λ (actually, 1/2Λ, for convenience) is a multi-dimensional version of Kyle’s
lambda, which can also be justified by inventory considerations (e.g., Grossman and Miller

7

(1988) or Greenwood (2005) for the multi-asset case). While this transaction-cost specification is chosen partly for tractability, the empirical literature generally finds transaction
costs to be convex (e.g., Engle, Ferstenberg, and Russell (2008), Lillo, Farmer, and Mantegna (2003)), with some researchers actually estimating quadratic trading costs (e.g., Breen,
Hodrick, and Korajczyk (2002)).
Most of our results hold with this general transaction cost function, but some of the
resulting expressions are simpler in the following special case.

Assumption A. Transaction costs are proportional to the amount of risk, Λ = λΣ.

This assumption means that the transaction cost matrix Λ is some scalar λ > 0 times
the variance-covariance matrix of returns, Σ, as is natural and, in fact, implied by the model
of Gârleanu, Pedersen, and Poteshman (2009). To understand this, suppose that a dealer
takes the other side of the trade ∆xt , holds this position for a period of time and “lays it
off” at the end of the period. Then the dealer’s risk is ∆x>
t Σ∆xt and the trading cost is the
dealer’s compensation for risk, depending on the dealer’s risk aversion reflected by λ.
The investor’s objective is to choose the dynamic trading strategy (x0 , x1 , ...) to maximize
the present value of all future expected excess returns, penalized for risks and trading costs:

We solve the model using dynamic programming. We start by introducing a value function V (xt−1 , ft ) measuring the value of entering period t with a portfolio of xt−1 securities

(A.22), and Axx is positive definite.6

III. Results: Aim in Front of the Target
We next explore the properties of the optimal portfolio policy, which turns out to be
intuitive and relatively simple. The core idea is that the investor aims to achieve a certain
position, but trades only partially towards this “aim portfolio” due to transaction costs.
The aim portfolio itself combines the current optimal portfolio in the absence of transaction
costs and the expected future such portfolios. The formal results are stated in the following
propositions.
Proposition 2 (Trade Partially Towards the Aim) (i) The optimal portfolio is
xt = xt−1 + Λ−1 Axx (aim t − xt−1 ) ,

(7)

which implies trading at a proportional rate given by the the matrix Λ−1 Axx towards the “aim
portfolio,”
aim t = A−1
xx Axf ft .

(8)

(ii) Under Assumption A, the optimal trading rate is the scalar a/λ < 1, where
a =

−(γ(1 − ρ) + λρ) +

p

(γ(1 − ρ) + λρ)2 + 4γλ(1 − ρ)2
.
2(1 − ρ)

The trading rate is decreasing in transaction costs λ and increasing in risk aversion γ.

9

(9)

This proposition provides a simple and appealing trading rule. The optimal portfolio is
a weighted average of the existing portfolio xt−1 and the aim portfolio:
xt =



1−

a
a
xt−1 + aim t .
λ
λ

(10)

The weight of the aim portfolio — which we also call the “trading rate” — determines
how far the investor should rebalance towards the aim. Interestingly, the optimal portfolio
always rebalances by fixed fraction towards the aim (i.e., the trading rate is independent of
the current portfolio xt−1 or past portfolios). The optimal trading rate is naturally greater
if transaction costs are smaller. Said differently, high transaction costs imply that one must
trade more slowly. Also, the trading rate is greater if risk aversion is larger, since a larger
risk aversion makes the risk of deviating from the aim more painful. A larger absolute risk
aversion can also be viewed as a smaller investor, for whom transaction costs play a smaller
role, and who therefore trades closer to her aim.
Next, we want to understand the aim portfolio. The aim portfolio in our dynamic setting
turns out to be closely related to the optimal portfolio in a static model without transaction
costs (Λ = 0), which we call the M arkowitz portfolio. In agreement with the classical
findings of Markowitz (1952),
Markowitz t = (γΣ)−1 Bft .

(11)

As is well known, the Markowtiz portfolio is the tangency portfolio appropriately leveraged
depending on the risk aversion γ.
Proposition 3 (Aim in Front of the Target) (i) The aim portfolio is the weighted average of the current Markowitz portfolio and the expected future aim portfolio. Under Assumption A, this can be written as follows, letting z = γ/(γ + a):
aim t = z Markowitz t + (1 − z) Et (aim t+1 ).

(12)

(ii) The aim portfolio can also be expressed as the weighted average of the current Markowitz
10

portfolio and the expected Markowitz portfolios at all future times. Under Assumption A,
aim t =

∞
X

z(1 − z)τ −t Et (Markowitz τ ) .

(13)

τ =t

The weight z of the current Markowitz portfolio decreases with the transaction costs (λ) and
increases in risk aversion (γ).
We see that the aim portfolio is a weighted average of current and future expected
Markowitz portfolios. While, without transaction costs, the investor would like to hold the
Markowitz portfolio to earn the highest possible risk-adjusted return, with transaction costs
the investor needs to economize on trading and thus trade partially towards the aim and,
as a result, he needs to adjust his aim in front of the target. Proposition 3 shows that the
optimal aim portfolio is an exponential average of current and future (expected) Markowitz
portfolios, where the weight on the current (and near term) Markowitz portfolio is larger if
transaction costs are smaller.
A graphical illustration of optimal trading rule. The optimal trading policy is [Figure 2]
illustrated in detail in Figure 2. Panel A of Figure 2 shows how the optimal first trade
is derived, Panel B shows the expected second trade, and Panel C shows the entire path
of expected future trades. Let’s first understand Panel A. The solid curve is the expected
path of future Markowitz portfolios. Since expected returns mean revert, the expected
Markowitz portfolio converges to its long-term mean, illustrated at the origin of the figure.
In this example, asset 2 loads on a factor that decays the fastest, so the future Markowitz
positions are expected to have relatively larger positions in asset 1. As a result of the general
alpha decay and transaction costs, the current aim portfolio has smaller positions than the
Markowitz portfolio and, as a result of the differential alpha decay, the aim portfolio loads
more on asset 1. The optimal new position is found by moving partially towards the aim
portfolio. Panel B shows that the expected next trade is towards the new aim, using the
same logic as before. Panel C traces out the entire path of expected future positions. The
optimal strategy is to chase a moving target, adjusting the aim for alpha decay and trading
patiently by always edging partially towards the aim.7
11

To further understand the aim portfolio, we can characterize the effect of the future
expected Markowitz portfolios in terms of the different trading signals (or factors), ft , and
their mean reversion speeds. Naturally, a more persistent factor has a larger effect on future
Markowitz portfolios than a factor that quickly mean reverts. Indeed, the central relevance
of signal persistence in the presence of transaction costs is one of the distinguishing features
of our analysis.
Proposition 4 (Weight Signals Based on Alpha Decay) (i) Under Assumption A, the
aim portfolio is the Markowitz portfolio built as if the signals f were scaled down based on
their mean reversion Φ:

(ii) If the matrix Φ is diagonal, Φ = diag(φ1 , ..., φK ), then the aim portfolio simplifies as the
Markowitz portfolio with each factor ftk scaled down based on its own alpha decay φk :

(15)

(iii) A persistent factor i is scaled down less than a fast factor j, and the relative weight of i
compared to that of j increases in the transaction cost, i.e., (1+φj a/γ)/(1+φi a/γ) increases
in λ.
This proposition shows explicitly the close link between the optimal dynamic aim portfolio
in light of transaction costs and the classic Markowitz portfolio. The aim portfolio resembles
the Markowitz portfolio, but the factors are scaled down based on transaction costs (captured
by a), risk aversion (γ), and, importantly, the mean-reversion speed of the factors (Φ).
The aim portfolio is particularly simple under the rather standard assumption that the
dynamics of each factor f k depend only on its own level (not the level of the other factors),
that is, Φ = diag(φ1 , ..., φK ) is diagonal, so that Equation (2) simplifies to scalars:
k
∆ft+1
= −φk ftk + εkt+1 .

(16)
12

The resulting aim portfolio is very similar to the Markowitz portfolio, (γΣ)−1 Bft . Hence,
transaction costs imply first that one optimally only trades part of the way towards the
aim, and, second, that the aim down-weights each return-predicting factor more the higher
is its alpha decay φk . Down-weighting factors reduces the size of the position, and, more
importantly, changes the relative importance of the different factors. This feature is also
seen in Figure 2. The convex J-shape of the path of expected future Markowitz portfolios
indicates that the factors that predict a high return for asset 2 decay faster than those that
predict asset 1. To make this point in a different way, if the expected returns of the two
assets decayed equally fast, then the Markowitz portfolio would be expected to move linearly
towards its long-term mean. Since the aim portfolio downweights the faster decaying factors,
the investor trades less towards asset 2. To see this graphically, note that the aim lies below
the line joining the Markowitz portfolio with the origin, thus downweighting asset 2 relative
to asset 1. Naturally, giving more weight to the more persistent factors means that the
investor trades towards a portfolio that not only has a high expected return now, but also
is expected to have a high expected return for a longer time in the future.
We end this section by considering what portfolio an investor ends up owning if he always
follows our optimal strategy.
Proposition 5 (Position Homing In) Suppose that the agent has followed the optimal
trading strategy from time −∞ until time t. Then the current portfolio is an exponentially
weighted average of past aim portfolios. Under Assumption A,

τ =−∞

(17)

We see that the optimal portfolio is an exponentially weighted average of current and past
aim portfolios. Clearly, the history of the past expected returns affects the current position,
since the investor trades patiently to economize on transaction costs. One reading of the
proposition is that the investor computes the exponentially weighted average of past aim
portfolios and always trades all the way to this portfolio (assuming that his initial portfolio
is right, otherwise the first trade is suboptimal).
13

IV. Persistent Transaction Costs
In some cases the impact of trading on prices may have a non-negligible persistent component. If an investor trades weekly and the current prices are unaffected by his trades
during the previous week, then the temporary transaction cost model above is appropriate.
However, if the frequency of trading is large relative to the the resiliency of prices, then the
investor will be affected by persistent price-impact costs.
To study this situation, we extend the model by letting the price be given by p̄t = pt + Dt
and the investor incur the cost associated with the persistent price distortion Dt in addition
to the temporary trading cost T C from before. Hence, the price p̄t is the sum of the price
pt without the persistent effect of the investor’s own trading (as before) and the new term
Dt , which captures the accumulated price distortion due to the investor’s (previous) trades.
Trading an amount ∆xt pushes prices by C ∆xt such that the price distortion becomes
Dt +C ∆xt , where C is Kyle’s lambda for persistent price moves. Further, the price distortion
mean reverts at a speed (or “resiliency”) R. Hence, the price distortion next period (t + 1)
is
Dt+1 = (I − R) (Dt + C ∆xt ) .

(18)

The investor’s objective is as before, with a natural modification due to the price distortion:

(19)

Let us explain the various new terms in this objective function. The first term is the position
xt times the expected excess return of the price p̄t = pt + Dt given inside the inner square
brackets. As before, the expected excess return of pt is Bft . The expected excess return due

14

to the post-trade price distortion is
Dt+1 − (1 + rf )(Dt + C ∆xt ) = −(R + rf ) (Dt + C ∆xt ) .

(20)

The second term is the penalty for taking risk as before. The three terms on the second line
of (19) are discounted at (1 − ρ)t because these cash flows are incurred at time t, not time
t + 1. The first of these is the temporary transaction cost as before. The second reflects
the mark-to-market gain from the old position xt−1 from the price impact of the new trade,
C∆xt . The last term reflects that the traded shares ∆xt are assumed to be executed at the
average price distortion, Dt + 21 C∆xt . Hence, the traded shares ∆xt earn a mark-to-market
1
gain of 12 ∆x>
t C∆xt as the price moves up an additional 2 C∆xt .

The value function is now quadratic in the extended state variable (xt−1 , yt ) ≡ (xt−1 , ft , Dt ):

V (x, y) = − x> Axx x + x> Axy y + y > Ayy y + A0 .

As before, there exists a unique solution to the Bellman equation and the following proposition characterizes the optimal portfolio strategy.
Proposition 6 The optimal portfolio xt is
xt = xt−1 + M rate (aimt − xt−1 ) ,

(21)

which tracks an aim portfolio, aimt = M aim yt . The aim portfolio depends on the returnpredicting factors and the price distortion, yt = (ft , Dt ). The coefficient matrices M rate and
M aim are stated in the appendix.
The optimal trading policy has a similar structure to before, but the persistent price impact
changes both the trading rate and the aim portfolio. The aim is now a weighted average of
current and expected future Markowitz portfolios, as well as the current price distortion.
Figure 3 illustrates graphically the optimal trading strategy with temporary and persistent price impact. Panel A uses the parameters from Figures 1–2 with only temporary [Figure 3]
transaction costs, Panel B has both temporary and persistent transaction costs, while Panel

C has purely persistent price impact. Specifically, suppose that Kyle’s lambda for temporary
price impact is Λ = wΛ̃ and Kyle’s lambda for persistent price impact is C = (1 − w)Λ̃,
where we vary w to determine how much of the price impact is temporary versus persistent
and where Λ̃ is a fixed matrix. Panel A has w = 1 (pure temporary costs), Panel B has
w = 0.5 (both temporary and persistent costs), and Panel C has w = 0 (pure persistent
costs).8
We see that the optimal portfolio policy with persistent transaction costs also tracks the
Markowitz portfolio while aiming in front of the target. It can be shown more generally
that the optimal portfolio under persistent price impact depends on the expected future
Markowitz portfolios (i.e., aims in front of the target). This is similar to the case of temporary
price impact, but what is different with purely persistent price impact is that the initial trade
is larger and, even in continuous time, there can be jumps in the portfolio. This is because,
when the price impact is persistent, the trader incurs a transaction cost based on the entire
cumulative trade, and therefore is more willing to incur it early in order to start collecting
the benefits of a better portfolio. (The resilience still makes it cheaper to postpone part of
trade, however). Furthermore, the cost of buying a position and selling it shortly thereafter
is much smaller with persistent price impact.

V. Theoretical Applications
We next provide a few simple and useful examples of our model.

Example 1: Timing a single security
A simple case is when there is only one security. This occurs when an investor is timing
his long or short view of a particular security or market. In this case, Assumption A (Λ = λΣ)
is without loss of generality since all parameters are scalars, and we use the notation σ 2 = Σ
and B = (β 1 , ..., β K ). Assuming that Φ is diagonal, we can apply Proposition 4 directly to

16

get the optimal timing portfolio:
xt =

λ γσ i=1 1 + φ a/γ

(22)

Example 2: Relative-value trades based on security characteristics
It is natural to assume that the agent uses certain characteristics of each security to
predict its returns. Hence, each security has its own return-predicting factors (whereas, in
the general model above, all the factors could influence all the securities). For instance,
one can imagine that each security is associated with a value characteristic (e.g., its own
book-to-market) and a momentum characteristic (its own past return). In this case, it is
natural to let the expected return for security s be given by
s
Et (rt+1
)=

X

β i fti,s ,

(23)

i

where fti,s is characteristic i for security s (e.g., IBM’s book-to-market) and β i be the predictive ability of characteristic i (i.e., how book-to-market translates into future expected
return, for any security), which is the same for all securities s. Further, we assume that
characteristic i has the same mean-reversion speed for each security, that is, for all s,
i,s
∆ft+1
= −φi fti,s + εi,s
t+1 .

(24)

We collect the current values of characteristic i for all securities in a vector

fti

=



fti,1 , ..., fti,S

>

e.g., the book-to-market of security 1, book-to-market of security 2, etc.
This setup based on security characteristics is a special case of our general model. To
map it into the general model, we stack all the various characteristic vectors on top of each

17

,

other into f :


ft1





 .. 
ft =  .  .


ftI

(25)

Further, we let IS×S be the S-by-S identity matrix and can express B using the Kronecker
product:


β1



B = β > ⊗ IS×S =  0

βI

(26)

Thus, Et (rt+1 ) = Bft . Also, let Φ = diag(φ ⊗ 1S×1 ) = diag(φ1 , ..., φ1 , ..., φI , ..., φI ). With
these definitions, we apply Proposition 4 to get the optimal characteristic-based relativevalue trade as
xt =

Example 3: Static model
Consider an investor who performs a static optimization involving current expected returns, risk, and transaction costs. Such an investor simply solves
γ >

max x>
t Et (rt+1 ) − xt Σxt − ∆xt Σ∆xt .
xt

xt =

γ
γ
xt−1 +
(γΣ)−1 Et (rt+1 ) = xt−1 +
(Markowitz t − xt−1 ) .
γ+λ
γ+λ
γ+λ

(29)

This optimal static portfolio in light of transaction costs differs from our optimal dynamic
portfolio in two ways: (i) The weight on the current portfolio xt−1 is different, and (ii) the
18

aim portfolio is different since in the static case the aim portfolio is the Markowitz portfolio.
Problem (i) with the static portfolio, namely that it prescribes a suboptimal trading rate
because it does not account for the future benefits of the position can be fixed by changing
the transaction-cost parameter λ (or risk aversion γ or both).
However, problem (ii) cannot be fixed in this way. Interestingly, with multiple returnpredicting factors, no choice of risk aversion γ and trading cost λ recovers the dynamic
solution. This is because the static solution treats all factors the same, while the dynamic
solution gives more weight to factors with slower alpha decay. We show empirically in
Section VI that even the best choice of γ and λ in a static model may perform significantly
worse than our dynamic solution. To recover the dynamic solution in a static setting, one
must change not just γ and λ, but additionally the expected returns Et (rt+1 ) = Bft by
changing B as described in Proposition 4.

Example 4: Today’s first signal is tomorrow’s second signal
Suppose that the investor is timing a single market using each of the several past daily
returns to predict the next return. In other words, the first signal ft1 is the daily return for
yesterday, the second signal ft2 is the return the day before yesterday, and so on for K past
time periods. In this case, the trader already knows today what some of her signals will look
like in the future. Today’s yesterday is tomorrow’s day-before-yesterday:
1
ft+1
= ε1t+1
k
ft+1
= ftk−1

for k > 1

Said differently, the matrix Φ has the form


Suppose for simplicity that all signals are equally important for predicting returns B =
(β, ..., β) and use the notation σ 2 = Σ. Then we can use Proposition 4 to get the optimal
trading strategy

Hence, the optimal portfolio gives the largest weight to the first signal (yesterday’s return),
the second largest to the second signal, and so on. This is intuitive, since the first signal will
continue to be important the longest, the second signal the second longest, and so on.

VI. Empirical Application: Dynamic Trading of Commodity Futures
In this section we illustrate our approach using data on commodity futures. We show
how dynamic optimizing can improve performance in an intuitive way, and how it changes
the way new information is used.

A. Data
We consider 15 different liquid commodity futures, which do not have tight restrictions
on the size of daily price moves (limit up/down). In particular, as seen in Table I, we collect [Table I]
data on Aluminum, Copper, Nickel, Zinc, Lead, and Tin from the London Metal Exchange
(LME), Gasoil from the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), WTI Crude, RBOB Unleaded
Gasoline, and Natural Gas from the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), Gold and
Silver from the New York Commodities Exchange (COMEX), and Coffee, Cocoa, and Sugar
from the New York Board of Trade (NYBOT). (This excludes futures on various agriculture
and livestock that have tight price limits.) We consider the sample period 01/01/1996 –
01/23/2009, for which we have data on all the commodities.9
20

For each commodity and each day, we collect the futures price measured in U.S. dollars
per contract. For instance, if the gold price is $1,000 per ounce, the price per contract is
$100,000, since each contract is for 100 ounces. Table I provides summary statistics on each
contract’s average price, the standard deviation of price changes, the contract multiplier
(e.g., 100 ounces per contract in the case of gold), and daily trading volume.
We use the most liquid futures contract of all maturities available. By always using data
on the most liquid futures, we are implicitly assuming that the trader’s position is always
held in these contracts. Hence, we are assuming that when the most liquid futures nears
maturity and the next contract becomes more liquid, the trader “rolls” into the next contract,
i.e., replaces the position in the near contract with the same position in the far contract.
Given that rolling does not change a trader’s net exposure, it is reasonable to abstract from
the transaction costs associated with rolling. (Traders in the real world do in fact behave
like this. There is a separate roll market, which entails far smaller costs than independently
selling the “old” contract and buying the “new” one.) When we compute price changes, we
always compute the change in price of a given contract (not the difference between the new
contract and the old one), since this corresponds to an implementable return. Finally, we
collect data on the average daily trading volume per contract as seen in the last column of
Table I. Specifically, we receive an estimate of the average daily volume of the most liquid
contract traded electronically and outright (i.e., not including calendar-spread trades) in
December 2010 from an asset manager based on underlying data from Reuters.

B. Predicting Returns and Other Parameter Estimates
We use the characteristic-based model described in Example 2 in Section II, where each
commodity characteristic is its own past return at various horizons. Hence, to predict returns,
we run a pooled panel regression:
s
rt+1
= 0.001 +

(0.17)

10.32 ft5D,s + 122.34 ft1Y,s −
(2.22)

(2.82)

21

205.59
(−1.79)

ft5Y,s + ust+1 ,

(31)

where the left-hand side is the daily commodity price changes and the right-hand side contains the return predictors: f 5D is the average past five days’ price change, divided by the
past five days’ standard deviation of daily price changes, f 1Y is the past year’s average
daily price change divided by the past year’s standard deviation, and f 5Y is the analogous
quantity for a five-year window. Hence, the predictors are rolling Sharpe ratios over three
different horizons, and, to avoid dividing by a number close to zero, the standard deviations
are winsorized below the tenth percentile of standard deviations. We estimate the regression
using feasible generalized least squares and report the t-statistics in brackets.
We see that price changes show continuation at short and medium frequencies and reversal over long horizons.10 The goal is to see how an investor could optimally trade on
this information, taking transaction costs into account. Of course, these (in-sample) regression results are only available now and a more realistic analysis would consider rolling
out-of-sample regressions. However, using the in-sample regression allows us to focus on
the economic insights underlying our novel portfolio optimization. Indeed, the in-sample
analysis allows us to focus on the benefits of giving more weight to signals with slower alpha
decay, without the added noise in the predictive power of the signals arising when using
out-of-sample return forecasts.)
The return predictors are chosen so that they have very different mean reversion:
5D,s
∆ft+1
= −0.2519ft5D,s + ε5D,s
t+1
1Y,s
∆ft+1
= −0.0034ft1Y,s + ε1Y,s
t+1

(32)

5Y,s
∆ft+1
= −0.0010ft5Y,s + ε5Y,s
t+1 .

These mean reversion rates correspond to a 2.4-day half life for the five-day signal, a 206-day
half life for the one-year signal, and a 700-day half life for the five-year signal.11
We estimate the variance-covariance matrix Σ using daily price changes over the full
sample, shrinking the correlations 50% towards zero. We set the absolute risk aversion
to γ = 10−9 , which we can think of as corresponding to a relative risk aversion of 1 for
an agent with 1 billion dollars under management. We set the time discount rate to ρ =
22

1 − exp(−0.02/260) corresponding to a 2 percent annualized rate.
Finally, to choose the transaction-cost matrix Λ, we make use of price-impact estimates
from the literature. In particular, we use the estimate from Engle, Ferstenberg, and Russell
(2008) that trades amounting to 1.59% of the daily volume in a stock have a price impact of
about 0.10%. (Breen, Hodrick, and Korajczyk (2002) provides a similar estimate.) Further,
Greenwood (2005) finds evidence that market impact in one security spills over to other
securities using the specification Λ = λΣ, where we recall that Σ is the variance-covariance
matrix. We calibrate Σ as the empirical variance-covariance matrix of price changes, where
the covariance are shrunk 50% towards zero for robustness.
We choose the scalar λ based on the Engle, Ferstenberg, and Russell (2008) estimate
by calibrating it for each commodity and then computing the mean and median across
commodities. Specifically, we collect data on the trading volume of each commodity contract
as seen in last column of Table I and then calibrate λ for each commodity as follows. Consider,
for instance, unleaded gasoline. Since gasoline has a turnover of 11,320 contracts per day
and a daily price-change volatility of $1,340, the transaction cost per contract when one
trades 1.59% of daily volume is 1.59%×11, 320 × λGasoline /2 × 1, 3402 , which is 0.10% of the
average price per contract of $48,000 if λGasoline = 3 × 10−7 .
We calibrate the trading costs for the other commodities similarly, and obtain a median value of 5.0 × 10−7 and a mean of 8.4 × 10−7 . There are significant differences across
commodities (e.g., the standard deviation is 1.0 × 10−6 ), reflecting that these estimates are
based on turnover while the specification Λ = λΣ assumes that transaction costs depend on
variances. While our model is general enough to handle transaction costs that depend on
turnover (e.g., by using these calibrated λ’s in the diagonal of the Λ matrix), we also need
to estimate the spill-over effects (i.e., the off-diagonal elements). Since Greenwood (2005)
provides the only estimate of these transaction-cost spill-overs in the literature using the
assumption Λ = λΣ and since real-world transaction costs likely depend on variance as well
as turnover, we stick to this specification and calibrate λ as the median across the estimates
for each commodity. Naturally, other specifications of the transaction-cost matrix would give

23

slightly different results, but our main purpose is simply to illustrate the economic insights
that we have proved in general theoretically.
We also consider a more conservative transaction cost estimate of λ = 10 × 10−7 . Alternatively, this more conservative analysis can be interpreted as the trading strategy of a
larger investor (i.e., we could have equivalently reduced the absolute risk aversion γ).

C. Dynamic Portfolio Selection with Trading Costs
We consider three different trading strategies: the optimal trading strategy given by
Equation (27) (“optimal”), the optimal trading strategy in the absence of transaction costs
(“Markowitz”), and a number of trading strategies based on a static (i.e., one-period)
transaction-cost optimization as in Equation (29) (“static optimization”). The static portfolio optimization results in trading partially towards the Markowitz portfolio (as opposed to
an aim portfolio that depends on signals’ alpha decays) and we consider ten different trading
speeds in seen in Table II. Hence, under the static optimization, the updated portfolio is a [Table II]
weighted average of the Markowitz portfolio (with weight denoted “weight on Markowitz”)
and the current portfolio.
Table II reports the performance of each strategy as measured by, respectively, its Gross
Sharpe Ratio and its Net Sharpe Ratio (i.e., its Sharpe ratio after accounting for transaction
costs). Panel A reports these numbers using our base-case transaction-cost estimate (discussed above), while Panel B uses our high transaction-cost estimate. We see that, naturally,
the highest SR before transaction costs is achieved by the Markowitz strategy. The optimal
and static portfolios have similar drops in gross SR due to their slower trading. After transaction costs, however, the optimal portfolio is the best, significantly better than the best
possible static strategy, and the Markowitz strategy incurs enormous trading costs.
It is interesting to consider the driver of the superior performance of the optimal dynamic
trading strategy relative to the best possible static strategy. The key to the out-performance
is that the dynamic strategy gives less weight to the five-day signal because of its fast alpha
decay. The static strategy simply tries to control the overall trading speed, but this is not

24

sufficient: it either incurs large trading costs due to its “fleeting” target (because of the
significant reliance on the five-day signal), or it trades so slowly it is difficult to capture the
return. The dynamic strategy overcomes this problem by trading somewhat fast, but trading
mainly according to the more persistent signals.
To illustrate the difference in the positions of the different strategies, Figure 4 shows [Figure 4]
the positions over time of two of the commodity futures, namely Crude and Gold. We
see that the optimal portfolio is a much smoother version of the Markowitz strategy, thus
reducing trading costs while at the same time capturing most of the excess return. Indeed,
the optimal position tends to be long when the Markowitz portfolio is long and short when
the Markowitz portfolio is short, and to be larger when the expected return is large, but
moderates the speed and magnitude of trades.

D. Response to New Information
It is instructive to trace the response to a shock to the return predictors, namely to εi,s
t
in Equation (32). Figure 5 shows the responses to shocks to each return-predicting factor, [Figure 5]
namely the five-day factor, the one-year factor, and the five-year factor.
The first panel shows that the Markowitz strategy immediately jumps up after a shock
to the five-day factor and slowly mean reverts as the alpha decays. The optimal strategy
trades much more slowly and never accumulates nearly as large a position. Interestingly,
since the optimal position also trades more slowly out of the position as the alpha decays,
the lines cross as the optimal strategy eventually has a larger position than the Markowitz
strategy.
The second panel shows the response to the one-year factor. The Markowitz jumps up
and decays, whereas the optimal position increases more smoothly and catches up as the
Markowitz starts to decay. The third panel shows the same for the 5Y signal, except that
the effects are slower and with opposite sign, since five-year returns predict future reversals.

25

VII. Conclusion
This paper provides a highly tractable framework for studying optimal trading strategies
in the presence of several return predictors, risk and correlation considerations, as well as
transaction costs. We derive an explicit closed-form solution for the optimal trading policy,
which gives rise to several intuitive results. The optimal portfolio tracks an “aim portfolio,”
which is analogous to the optimal portfolio in the absence of trading costs in its trade-off
between risk and return, but different since more persistent return predictors are weighted
more heavily relative to return predictors with faster alpha decay. The optimal strategy is
not to trade all the way to the aim portfolio, since this entails too high transaction costs.
Instead, it is optimal to take a smoother and more conservative portfolio that moves in the
direction of the aim portfolio while limiting turnover.
Our framework constitutes a powerful tool to optimally combine various return predictors
taking into account their evolution over time, decay rate, and correlation, and trading off
their benefits against risks and transaction costs. Such dynamic trade-offs are at the heart
of the decisions of “arbitrageurs” that help make markets efficient as per the efficient market
hypothesis. Arbitrageurs’ ability to do so is limited, however, by transaction costs, and our
model provides a tractable and flexible framework for the study of the dynamic implications
of this limitation.
We implement our optimal trading strategy for commodity futures. Naturally, the optimal trading strategy in the absence of transaction costs has a larger Sharpe ratio gross of
fees than our trading policy. However, net of trading costs our strategy performs significantly better, since it incurs far lower trading costs while still capturing much of the return
predictability and diversification benefits. Further, the optimal dynamic strategy is significantly better than the best static strategy — i.e., taking dynamics into account significantly
improves performance.
In conclusion, we provide a tractable solution to the dynamic trading strategy in a relevant and general setting that we believe to have many interesting applications. The main
insights for portfolio selection can be summarized by the rules that one should aim in front
26

of the target and trade partially towards the current aim.

The maximum value is attained by
xt = Jt−1 jt ,

(A.6)

and it is equal to V (xt−1 , ft ) = 21 jt> Jt−1 jt + dt . Combining this fact with (6) we obtain an
equation that must hold for all xt−1 and ft , which implies the following restrictions on the

28

coefficient matrices:12

The existence of a solution to this system of Riccati equations can be established using
standard results, e.g., as in Ljungqvist and Sargent (2004). In this case, however, we can

derive explicit expressions, as follows. We start by letting Z = Λ̄− 2 Axx Λ̄− 2 and M =

ρ̄−1 Z = I − (γM + I + Z)−1 ,

(A.10)

which is a quadratic with an explicit solution. Since all solutions Z can be written as a limit

Note that the positive definite choice of solution Z is the only one that results in a positive
29

definite matrix Axx .
The other value-function coefficient determining optimal trading is Axf , which solves the
linear equation (A.8). To write the solution explicitly, we note first that, from (A.7),
Λ̄(γΣ + Λ̄ + Axx )−1 = I − Axx Λ−1 .

(A.16)

Using the general rule that vec(XY Z) = (Z > ⊗ X) vec(Y ), we rewrite (A.8) in vectorized
form:
vec(Axf ) = ρ̄ vec((I − Axx Λ−1 )B)

(A.17)

+ρ̄((I − Φ)> ⊗ (I − Axx Λ−1 )) vec(Axf ),
so that
vec(Axf ) = ρ̄ I − ρ̄(I − Φ)> ⊗ (I − Axx Λ−1 )

−1

vec((I − Axx Λ−1 )B).

(A.18)

Finally, Af f is calculated from the linear equation (A.9), which is of the form
ρ̄−1 Af f = Q + (I − Φ)> Af f (I − Φ)

(A.19)

Q = (B + Axf (I − Φ))> (γΣ + Λ̄ + Axx )−1 (B + Axf (I − Φ))

(A.20)

with

a positive-definite matrix.
The solution is easiest to write explicitly for diagonal Φ, in which case
Af f,ij =

In general,
vec (Af f ) = ρ̄ I − ρ̄(I − Φ)> ⊗ (I − Φ)>

vec(Q).

(A.22)

One way to see that Af f is positive definite is to iterate (A.19) starting with A0f f = 0.
We conclude that the posited value function satisfies the Bellman equation.

Proof of Proposition 2.

Differentiating the Bellman equation (5) with respect to xt−1

gives
−Axx xt−1 + Axf ft = Λ(xt − xt−1 ),
which clearly implies (7) and (8).
In the case Λ = λΣ for some scalar λ > 0, and the solution to the value-function
coefficients is Axx = aΣ, where a solves a simplified version of (A.7):
−ρ̄−1 a =

with solution

a =

(A.24)

(γ + λ̄ρ)2 + 4γλ − (γ + λ̄ρ)
.
2

(A.25)

It follows immediately that Λ−1 Axx = a/λ.
Note that a is symmetric in (λρ(1 − ρ)−1 , γ). Consequently, a increases in λ if and only
if it increases in γ. Differentiating (A.25) with respect to λ, one gets

31

(A.27)

which is verified to hold with strict inequality as long as ρ̄γ > 0.
Finally, note that a/λ is increasing in γ and homogeneous of degree zero in (λ, γ), so that
applying Euler’s theorem for homogeneous functions gives

(γΣ × Markowitz t + Axx × Et (aimt+1 ))

To obtain the last equality, re-write (A.7) as
(Λ − Axx ) Λ−1 (γΣ + Λ̄ + Axx ) = Λ̄

(A.31)

and then further
γΣ + Axx = (γΣ + Λ̄ + Axx )Λ−1 Axx ,

(A.32)

since Axx Λ−1 Σ = ΣΛ−1 Axx . Equation (12) follows immediately as a special case.

aimt = (γΣ + Axx )−1 ×

which specializes to (13). Given that a increases in λ, z decreases in λ. Furthermore,
z increases in γ if and only if a/γ decreases, which is equivalent (by symmetry) to a/λ
decreasing in λ.

Proof of Proposition 4. In the case Λ = λΣ, equation (A.8) is solved by
Axf = λB((γ + λ̄ + a)I − λ(I − Φ))−1

(A.34)

which is the same as (14). Equation (15) is immediate.
For part (iii), we use the result shown above (proof of Proposition 2) that a increases in
λ, which implies that (1 + φj a/γ)/(1 + φi a/γ) does whenever φj > φi .

Proof of Proposition 5. Rewriting (7) as
xt =

(A.35)

and iterating this relation backwards gives

Table I: Summary Statistics. For each commodity used in our empirical study, the
first column reports the average price per contract in U.S. dollars over our sample period
01/01/1996–01/23/2009. For instance, since the average gold price is $431.46 per ounce, the
average price per contract is $43,146 since each contract is for 100 ounces. Each contract’s
multiplier (100 in the case of gold) is reported in the third column. The second column
reports the standard deviation of price changes. The fourth column reports the average
daily trading volume per contract, estimated as the average daily volume of the most liquid
contract traded electronically and outright (i.e., not including calendar-spread trades) in
December 2010.

Table II: Performance of Trading Strategies Before and After Transaction Costs.
This table shows the annualized Sharpe ratio gross and net of trading costs for the optimal
trading strategy in the absence of trading costs (“no TC”), our optimal dynamic strategy
(“optimal”), and a strategy that optimizes a static one-period problem with trading costs
(“static”). Panel A illustrates this for a low transaction cost parameter, while Panel B has
a high one.

Figure 1: Optimal Trading Strategy: Aim in Front of the Target. This figure shows
how the optimal trade moves the portfolio from the existing position xt−1 towards the aim
portfolio, trading only part of the way to the aim portfolio to limit transactions costs. The
aim portfolio is an average of the current Markowitz portfolio (the optimal portfolio in the
absence of transaction costs) and the expected future aim portfolio, which reflects how the
Markowitz portfolio is expected to mean-revert to its long-term level (the lower, left corner
of the figure).

This figure shows how the optimal trade moves from the existing position xt−1 towards the
aim, which puts relatively more weight on assets loading on persistent factors. Relative to
the Markowitz portoflio, the weight in the aim of asset 2 is lower because asset 2 has a fasterdecaying alpha, as is apparent in the lower expected weight it receives in future Markowitz
portfolios.

Figure 5: Optimal Trading in Response to Shock to Return Predicting Signals.
This figure shows the response in the optimal position following a shock to a return predictor
as a function of the number of days since the shock. The top left panel does this for a shock
to the fast five-day return predictor, the top right panel considers a shock to the 12-month
return predictor, and the bottom panel to the five-year predictor. In each case, we consider
the response of the optimal trading strategy in the absence of trading costs (“Markowitz”)
and our optimal dynamic strategy (“optimal”) using high and low transactions costs.
