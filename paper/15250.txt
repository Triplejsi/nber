On the Death of Distance and Borders: Evidence from the Nineteenth Century

NBER Working Paper No. 15250
August 2009
JEL No. F40,N70
ABSTRACT
In this paper, we investigate time-dependent border and distance effects in the nineteenth century and
document clear declines in the importance of these variables through time. What this suggests, in light
of the work for the post-1950 era, is that researchers might have correctly identified the increasing
effect of distance on bilateral trade over time. In other words, trade costs may have not declined nearly
as dramatically in the late twentieth century as has been supposed, especially in light of the nineteenth
century, a time of documented trade cost decline and commodity market integration.

1. Introduction
The process of commodity market integration has been an area of abiding theoretical and
empirical interest. Long-standing deviations from the law of one price have been documented for
a remarkably wide range of geographic areas and time periods. The literature on the topic has
recently been reoriented, primarily due to the work of Engel and Rogers (1996) and McCallum
(1995). The shared hypothesis of these two lines of research is that there is a marked effect of
national borders, both in terms of heightened commodity price variation and diminished trade
flows, which is registered in the data even after controlling for such things as distance and
exchange rate volatility. At the same time, recent work in economic history has moved away
from explaining cross-sectional differences in commodity market integration through the use of a
relatively small number of explanatory variables. Rather, it has considered changes in
commodity market integration over time through the use of variables capturing technological
change in the transport sector, monetary regime choice, commercial policy, and warfare (Jacks
2005, 2006).
This paper investigates time-dependent border and distance effects and documents clear
declines in the importance of these variables in the nineteenth century. This finding is contrary to
similar exercises for the late twentieth century, suggesting that advances in communication and
transportation over the past fifty years may have played less of a role in the present-day process
of globalization than is commonly believed.

2. The Death of Distance and Borders?
Since the work of Cairncross (1997), the notion of the “death of distance” has gained
traction. Citing radical improvements in the cost and efficacy of long-distance communication,

2

Cairncross depicts a world with free movement of goods, people, and ideas. Unfortunately, this
prognosis has been difficult to identify in the present-day trade data. One of the first to recognize
this fact was Leamer and Levinsohn who wrote “that the effect of distance on trade patterns is
not diminishing over time. Contrary to popular impression, the world is not getting dramatically
smaller” (1995, p. 1387).
Taking this view as a starting point, a string of papers has strongly confirmed these
results. Berthelon and Freund (2008) find corroborating evidence in highly disaggregated trade
data, suggesting that distance-related trade costs have been on the rise in recent years, rather than
falling as has often been assumed. Adding support to this view, Carrère and Schiff (2005) argue
that a trade-weighted measure of the distance separating trade partners (or distance-of-trade) has
been falling from the 1960s. Finally, Disdier and Head (2008) collect over 1000 estimated
distance coefficients from 78 previous studies and perform a meta-analysis. Their results are
rather stark: the estimated distance coefficient has been on the rise from 1950, suggesting that
there has been an exaggerated sense of the death of distance.
Economic historians have also begun the search for time-variant border effects. Thus, for
the nineteenth century, Shiue (2005) has investigated the implications for relative price volatility
of the Zollverein, which eventually created a customs union from 39 politically autonomous
German states in the 1830s and 1840s. Likewise for the twentieth century, Wolf (2005) has
examined the impact of Polish reunification following the First World War on domestic trade
flows. In both instances, the authors find that such historical “experiments” do indeed tend to
ease trade frictions created at national borders. However, relatively little evidence has been
brought to bear on the issue of variation in well-defined national borders in the long-run.

3. Empirics
The price data employed in this paper come from transactions in wheat markets for a set
of over 100 American and European cities in the period from 1800 to 1913. The coverage of and
sources for this data are detailed in Jacks (2005, 2006). From the perspective of the present day,
the choice of focusing on any one commodity—let alone wheat—may seem an odd one. After
all, in 2000 the global wheat trade accounted for roughly 0.2% of the $6.4 trillion in global
exports. However, the situation was much different in the nineteenth century as trade in basic
commodities predominated: even as late as the 1890s grains constituted fully 14% of the United
Kingdom’s imports while a similar figure holds for grains relative to total exports by the United
States in the same period. Thus, wheat markets seem to be a suitable benchmark by which to
gauge commodity market integration during the first wave of globalization.
The basic explicandum of this paper will be the standard deviation of the logged relative
price of wheat in cities j and k over a given time horizon, T (here, 132 months), or

(1) V

wheat
jkT

⎡ Pjtwheat ⎤
= St.Dev. ⎢ln( wheat )⎥.
⎢⎣ Pkt
⎥⎦

The reason for this choice of variables is relatively straightforward: it is widely used in the
contemporary literature (Engel and Rogers, 1996), so the comparability of results looms large.
Additionally, Anderson and van Wincoop (2004) have recently argued that this measure does a
reasonably good job of capturing the level and variation of trade costs in simulations. An
alternative measure, the mean of the logged relative price, is highly correlated (r = 0.6997) with
(1) and yields materially the same results. Again, (1) is preferred for the purposes of this paper
due to its ease of comparison with the contemporary literature.

Finally, a few words on the construction of the panel used in the following section are in
order. First, the long nineteenth century was broken into eleven non-overlapping periods (18001810, 1810-1820,…, 1890-1900, 1900-1910). Second, within a given country, all possible pairwise combinations of domestic cities were formed and observations on relative price volatility
were calculated. Finally, across countries, the price data for each country were matched with
prices from a set of five cities (Bruges, London, Lwow, Marseilles, and New York City) which
represent important international markets for wheat in the nineteenth century and for which data
exists over the entire period, thus, allowing for a consistent means of comparison across time and
countries. The resulting sample is almost evenly split between intra- and international
observations. Figures 1 and 2 depict the evolution through time of the price volatility measure
given in equation (1).
The basic estimating equation is the following:
T =11

wheat
(2) V jkT
= α + β1 ln dist jk + β 2 evol JKT + β 3borderjk + ∑ δ t d t + u jkT ,
t =1

where the dependent variable is time-variant and is defined as the relative price volatility
between two cities j and k from equation (1). The second term on the right-hand side, distjk,
refers to the distance separating cities j and k and is constructed as the sum of overland and
oceanic distances (with the latter assumed to be zero for domestic city-pairs); evolJKT is the
standard deviation of the monthly changes in the logged nominal exchange rate between the
currencies of countries J and K over the period, T; borderjk denotes the existence of a border
between cities j and k; and the di terms are time fixed-effects for the eleven sub-periods under
consideration. Thus, we expect relative price volatility to be increasing in distance, nominal
exchange rate volatility, and the presence of national borders.

5

Table 1 presents the results of this benchmark estimating equation employing four
different specifications: country, city, country-pair, and city-pair fixed effects. Thus, any city or
city-pair specific shocks—such as weather—are assumed to be orthogonal to the three
independent variables and, thus, captured in the error term. Given that distance and the existence
of a border are time-invariant while nominal exchange rate volatility is defined at the countrylevel, neither of these assumptions seem to be unduly onerous. In any case, the coefficients are
precisely estimated, and their signs conform with the priors given above.
Table 2 presents the first round of results on border and distance effects through time.
The basic estimating equation underlying these results is that of column (2) in Table 1, i.e. city
and time fixed effects are included. Here, only the time-interacted distance and border effects are
reported. Column (1) of Table 2 documents a secular downward trend in estimated border
effects. Indeed, the border effect in the period 1900-1910 is estimated to have been nearly 90%
less than that of 1800-1810. However, the reduction in the estimated effect was unevenly spread
throughout the nineteenth century. In this regard, the period from 1870 to 1880 clearly stands out
as a break-point in the series, and perhaps unsurprisingly so, as this period coincides with the
mass adoption of the gold standard, very limited outbreaks of interstate warfare, relatively liberal
commercial policy, and remarkably low nominal exchange rate volatility.
Likewise, Column (2) of Table 2 demonstrates that the effect of distance on relative price
volatility was also substantially diminishing over time with the estimated distance effect in the
period 1900-1910 being more than 83% less than that of 1800-1810. And again, most of the
gains in this regard seem to be concentrated later in the period with 1870 clearly marking the
transition.

6

In Table 3, a different exercise is explored, namely the differential effects of overland and
maritime distances. Distance is here calculated intranationally as the linear distance between two
cities and calculated internationally as the sum of the linear distance to the nearest port and the
trade-route specific (and nonlinear) distance between departure ports reported in Philip (1935).
Thus, international distances can be fully separated from the intranational component, leaving us
with a proxy for both distance and the border effect. The results in this instance are telling. The
coefficients on intranational distances, after climbing throughout the first half of the nineteenth
century, gradually fall in the period after 1860, reaching a level in 1900-1910 which is roughly
63% of the 1800-1810 value. The coefficients on international distance remain somewhat—but
not radically—smaller than those on intranational distances and trace essentially the same course
as those on intranational distances from 1800 to 1870. The period after 1870, however, witnesses
their absolute collapse. Indeed, the coefficients become very small in magnitude and statistically
indistinguishable from zero.
Running parallel to these results, Flandreau (1995) finds a sharp decline in the distance
coefficient in a standard gravity model of European trade flows in the period between 1870 and
1880. Thus, the coincidence of declining (absolute) values for the distance coefficients on both
relative price volatility and trade flows in this period allows for a plausible story in which the
amelioration of nominal exchange rate volatility, commitment to the gold standard, and the
spread of communication/transport networks lowered trade costs, and thus, stimulated trade
flows.

4. Conclusion
In this paper, we investigate time-dependent border and distance effects in the nineteenth
century and document clear declines in the importance of these variables through time. What this
suggests, in light of the work for the post-1950 era, is that researchers might have correctly
identified the increasing effect of distance on bilateral trade over time. In other words, trade costs
may have not declined nearly as dramatically in the late twentieth century as has been supposed,
especially in light of the nineteenth century, a time of documented trade cost decline and
commodity market integration.
