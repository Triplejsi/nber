Explaining the Price of Voluntary Carbon Offsets
Marc N. Conte and Matthew J. Kotchen
NBER Working Paper No. 15294
August 2009
JEL No. Q2,Q42,Q5
ABSTRACT
This paper investigates factors that explain the large variability in the price of voluntary carbon offsets.
We estimate hedonic price functions using a variety of provider- and project-level characteristics as
explanatory variables. We find that providers located in Europe sell offsets at prices that are approximately
30 percent higher than providers located in either North America or Australasia. Contrary to what
one might expect, offset prices are generally higher, by roughly 20 percent, when projects are located
in developing or least-developed nations. But this result does not hold for forestry-based projects.
We find evidence that forestry-based offsets sell at lower prices, and the result is particularly strong
when projects are located in developing or least-developed nations. Offsets that are certified under
the Clean Development Mechanism or the Gold Standard, and therefore qualify for emission reductions
under the Kyoto Protocol, sell at a premium of more than 30 percent; however, third-party certification
from the Voluntary Carbon Standard, one of the largest certifiers, is associated with a price discount.
Variables that have no effect on offset prices are the number of projects that a provider manages and
a provider’s status as for-profit or not-for-profit.

1. Introduction
There is widespread agreement on the need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in order
to mitigate the effects of global climate change, and attention is now focused on setting emission
targets and designing policies to help achieve them. The unique and difficult challenges associated with the design and implementation of GHG policies are well-known and have given rise to
a substantial academic literature (see, for example, Aldy and Stavins 2007). Among the significant challenges that must be overcome are concerns about the high costs of compliance and distributional equity. In response to these concerns, nearly all GHG policies—regardless of whether
they are implemented at the regional, national, or international level—allow offsets to count toward emission reductions.
Offsets are based on the idea that agents need not reduce their own emissions in order to
reduce the amount of GHGs in the atmosphere; instead, they can pay someone else to reduce
emissions and achieve the same effect on atmospheric concentrations. Agents prefer offsets, of
course, if the payment required is less than their own abatement costs. Offsets work in principle
because GHGs are uniformly distributed pollutants in the global atmosphere, and the location of
emissions (or reductions) has no effect on the impact of climate change. Only the net effect on
overall GHG emissions is what matters. Typically, offsets arise through investments in renewable
energy, energy efficiency, reforestation, or other projects that reduce emissions or sequester
GHGs. Though usually referred to as “carbon offsets,” many projects focus on other GHGs, such
as projects based on biomass and industrial methane capture, and emission reductions are measured in carbon dioxide equivalent units (CO2e).
Carbon offsets provide the basis for two of the Kyoto Protocol’s primary mechanisms for
reducing GHG emissions in the context of an international environmental agreement. Under
Joint Implementation (JI), industrialized nations can purchase carbon credits (effectively offsets)
from emission-reducing projects located in other industrialized nations or nations with transition

1

economies.1 Under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), industrialized countries can purchase offsets in much the same way, though CDM credits are acquired through the finance of
projects in developing nations. 2 Questions about offsets are also playing a pivotal role in determining the future of the Waxman-Markey bill, which sets emissions targets and seeks to establish
a national cap-and-trade program in the United States. Recent drafts of the legislation allow businesses to offset up to 30 or 63 percent of their emissions.3
Beyond the regulatory setting, efforts to reduce GHG emissions are also being undertaken
around the globe voluntarily. It is increasingly common for businesses, organizations, and individuals to voluntarily purchase carbon offsets. According to Hamilton et al. (2009), the number
of offsets traded in the voluntary, over-the-counter market increased 87 percent from 2007 to
2008, and transactions totaled 124.3 million metric tons of CO2e. While the quantity of GHG reductions from voluntary offsets is relatively modest, representing 3 percent of the offsets traded
in regulated markets, the money being spent is not trivial. Expenditures in the voluntary market
totaled more than US$700 million in 2008 alone, and forecasts predict further expansion of the
market. Among businesses, organizations, and individuals, the motives for voluntary offsets
range from the development of strategies for corporate environmental management, the pursuit
of public relations or reputation benefits, and even the desire for guilt alleviation (see Kotchen
2009a, 2009b). But along with the increased popularity of voluntary offsets have come calls for
more oversight of the market. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has be-

Further along in the United States are state and regional policies, including the noteworthy examples of California’s AB 32 and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) of 10 Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states. While
negotiations are still underway about the amount of offsets that will be allowed under California’s AB 32, participants in the RGGI are allowed to offset up to 10 percent of their emission reductions, depending on the price of
permits in a cap-and-trade program.

gun investigating concerns about the market and whether there is a need for greater consumer
protection.
In both regulatory and voluntary settings, offsets generate controversy. Despite the cost
savings, there are those who object in principle to the idea of paying someone else to reduce
emissions, rather than doing it oneself. More pragmatic concerns tend to focus on whether carbon offsets are additional, permanent, and credible. Offsets are additional only if the project reduces emissions relative to an established baseline level of emissions, typically meaning that the
reductions would not have occurred without the offset payment. Though the idea of establishing
additionality is simple in theory, the practice of determining baseline trends against which to
compare offset projects is a challenging problem without clear guidelines. There are also concerns about the permanence of emission reductions or sequestration, particularly when it comes
to forestry-based offsets, which are subject to future uncertainty about land use, forest health, and
the risk of fire. These issues have led some to argue that the price of forestry-based offsets should
be discounted to reflect the inherent uncertainty of such projects (Pfaff et al. 2000; Kim, McCarl
and Murray 2008). Further issues arise because of asymmetric information. Offset providers
know a lot about the projects in which they invest, but offset buyers know only what the providers tell them. The asymmetry gives rise to a standard source of market failure. Consequently,
many third-party organizations have emerged to set standards, audit projects, and verify whether
offset providers are delivering on the quality and quantity of their claims.
The present paper seeks to further the understanding of underlying patterns in the market
for voluntary carbon offsets. We focus on a fundamental question: What explains the price of voluntary carbon offsets? The rationale for carbon offsets is that they provide a mechanism to reduce GHG emissions at a lower cost. Moreover, because a unit of GHG reductions has the same
effect regardless of where and how it takes place, at least from the perspective of climate change,
one might expect the market to converge to the law of one price. But, as we will show, the price
of carbon offsets is highly variable. One explanation for the price variability is that carbon off-

3

sets are impure public goods, meaning that they contain both private and public characteristics
that may affect supply and demand (Kotchen 2006). For instance, people may be inclined to purchase carbon offsets because of co-benefits associated with poverty alleviation or biodiversity
conservation, giving rise to offsets sometimes referred to as “charismatic carbon.”
To help explain the variability in offset prices, we estimate hedonic price functions that
focus on characteristics of offset providers and offset projects themselves. Characteristics of the
offset providers that we consider include geographic location, status as for-profit or not-forprofit, and size in terms of the number of projects being managed. Detailed data on specific offset projects include the nation in which the project is located, different types of third-party certification, and the mechanism by which the project reduces emissions (wind, solar, biomass, forestry, etc.). Our primary source of data is the Carbon Catalog (CC), which is an online directory
that provides detailed information on carbon offset providers and projects worldwide. The complete dataset consists of information on 97 offset providers and 280 offset projects.
By identifying key determinants of carbon offset prices, this paper will inform continuing debate about the appropriate role of offsets in a regulatory context, as well as ongoing controversy in the voluntary market. Some of the main findings of our econometric analysis include
the following: Providers located in Europe sell offsets at prices that are approximately 30 percent
higher than providers located elsewhere. Contrary to what one might expect, offset prices are
higher, by roughly 20 percent, when projects are located in developing or least-developed nations. We find evidence that forestry-based offsets sell at lower prices, and the result is particularly strong when the projects are located in developing or least-developed nations. Offsets that
are certified to qualify under the Kyoto Protocol sell at a premium of more than 30 percent, while
third-party certification from the Voluntary Carbon Standard (VCS), one of the largest certifiers,
is associated with a price discount of nearly 25 percent.
In the next section, we describe the data used in our analysis and report descriptive statistics that characterize the market for carbon offsets. Section 3 describes our empirical methods

4

and the results of our econometric analysis at both the provider- and project-level. We then discuss, in Section 4, a range of possible explanations for the empirical findings, along with more
general policy implications. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the main results and concludes.

2. Data
The Carbon Catalog (CC) is our primary source of data. CC is a publicly-available, online directory that provides the most comprehensive and up-to-date information on carbon offset providers
and projects worldwide.4 CC is a freely available service that does not sell carbon offsets and
whose mission is to simply increase transparency in the market. Our dataset includes all providers and projects listed on CC through December 2008. The complete dataset includes observations on 97 offset providers and 280 offset projects.
The offset providers are located in three different regions of the world: Europe (43%),
North America (40%), and Australasia (16%). Among all providers, 34 percent are listed as having not-for-profit status, and it might be of interest that the percentage of not-for-profit providers
differs substantially between Europe (29%) and North America (41%).5 The majority of providers manage more than one offset project. In particular, the average number of projects per provider is 3.6, ranging from a low of 1 to a high of 28. Among all providers, 35 percent manage a
single project, and fewer than 5 percent manage 10 projects or more. Offset prices are reported at
the provider level and represent the cost in 2007 US dollars of offsetting one tonne of CO2e. The
price is highly variable among providers, as shown in Figure 1, and ranges from a low of $2.55
to a high of $69.2. The average price is $18.15, with the majority falling between $10 and $25
per tonne.

All information about Carbon Catalog (CC), including most of the data used in this paper, is available at the following url: http://www.carboncatalog.com.

A possible explanation for the difference between Europe and North America is that the European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading System (EU ETS) has capped industrial emissions for several years, while allowing the
purchase of offsets, as explained previously. One would expect this to have increased demand for carbon offsets and
therefore increase the incentive to establish for-profit offset providers.

5

CC provides further information about the 280 specific projects listed on its website. Variables central to our analysis are the project’s geographic location, mechanism for offsetting
emissions, and status regarding selected third-party certification. Figure 2 illustrates how the projects are distributed across nations. Asia and North America each host approximately 30 percent
of the individual projects, while Australia, Europe, and South America are each host to between 7
and 9 percent. We also see that nations with a particularly high number of offset projects are Brazil, China, India, and the United States. For purposes of our analysis, we categorize projects as
being located in industrialized, developing, or least-developed nations based on the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) classification system. The proportion in
each category is reported in the upper-left panel of Figure 3. Roughly the same number of projects, about 44 percent, are found in industrialized and developing nations, while 11 percent are
located in least-developed nations.
The upper-right panel of Figure 3 illustrates the breakdown of project type in terms of the
mechanism whereby CO2e emissions are offset. Projects associated with reforestation, and possibly avoided deforestation, are most common, comprising 34 percent of all offset projects. Other
categories with a substantial number of projects are biomass methane capture (16%), wind generated electricity (14%), and industrial methane capture (9%). All other types comprise near or
below five percent of all projects. In the order of prevalence, the categories include projects
based on fuel efficiency, hydropower, fuel substitution, solar power, efficient lighting, environmental building, material substitution, public transportation, geothermal power, and heat electricity cogeneration. A final category, referred to as market-based, does not have a specified type because it is based on created markets in which offsets are bought and sold from projects of various
types. Only a small number of observations fall in this last category and include emission allowances from the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX), New South Wales Greenhouse Gas Abatement Scheme (GGAS), and European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading System (EU
ETS).

6

The final panel in Figure 3 illustrates data on selected third-party certification of offset
projects. CC considers only three types of certification: the Clean Development Mechanism
(CDM), the Gold Standard (GS), and the Voluntary Carbon Standard (VCS). CDM projects are
those that qualify as part of the Kyoto Protocol as satisfying criteria so that industrialized nations
can receive credit for emission reductions through the finance of offset projects in developing
nations. The GS certification goes above and beyond the CDM in setting high-end offset criteria
that promote sustainable development and focus on renewable energy and energy efficiency. The
VCS is an independent classification standard that aims to set a quality threshold for the purpose
of standardizing and stimulating innovation in the voluntary offset market. The CDM, GS, and
VCS certifications account for twelve, two, and eight percent of the projects in the dataset.6
While 80 percent of the projects in the dataset are not certified by any of these three systems, we
do not know whether they are completely uncertified or certified by some other standard. As reviewed by Hamilton et al. (2009), there are several other certification standards, but the three
considered by CC are the most common.
In addition to the variables described above, we sought to incorporate several other provider- and project-level attributes into our analysis. At the provider-level, we have data on the
self-reported efficiency of the operation, which records the percentage of the price that goes to
fund the offset-producing project. At the project level, we have data on both the size of the project, in terms of the quantity of GHGs offset, and the time horizon over which the project would
operate. The additional variables described in this paragraph, however, are based on data of questionable quality and/or are only available for a subset of the providers and projects in the overall
data set. For these reasons, and because we never found meaningful results based on these variables, we do not include them in the results reported here.

6

One additional clarification is necessary about double counting of three GS projects that are also CDM projects,
which is to be expected since GS applies a more rigorous standard. There are, however, two GS projects that are not
CDM, and this is because these projects qualify for Joint Implementation (JI) under the Kyoto Protocol.

3. Methods and Results
The primary objective of our empirical analysis is to determine which variables explain variability in the price of carbon offsets. We estimate hedonic price functions at two different levels of
data aggregation. We begin at the provider level and then consider the more disaggregated project level.

3.1. Provider-Level Analysis
Data on the price of carbon offsets are available at the provider level, so it is natural to begin our
analysis with models that seek to explain the price of carbon offsets as a function of general characteristics of the offset providers. We consider whether offset prices differ systematically based
on where the provider is located and whether it has for-profit or not-for-profit status. We also investigate the effect on offset price of the number of projects under management, whether the projects are located in non-industrialized nations, whether projects are based on forest carbon sequestration (distinctions based on other project types are made in the next subsection), and
whether projects are certified as valid under the Kyoto Protocol.
We estimate regression models with the general form
Pi = f (locationi, nonprofiti, numprojectsi, nonindusti, forestryi, kyotoi) + εi,
where Pi is the price of carbon offsets per tonne of CO2e offered by provider i, locationi is a
categorical variable indicating the region where the provider is located (Australasia, North America, Europe), and nonprofiti is a dummy variable indicating not-for-profit status. The other variables characterize general features of the projects that each provider manages: numprojectsi is the
number of offset projects under management, nonindusti is the proportion of projects located in
either developing or least-developed nations, forestryi is the proportion of projects with forestrybased carbon sequestration, and kyotoi is the proportion of projects that have CDM or GS certifi-

8

cation. 7 Finally, εi is an error term assumed to be normally distributed. We estimate linear and
log-linear specifications using ordinary least squares (OLS). For reasons described below, we
also estimate models in which the project-related variables are defined in an alternative way as
dummy variables indicating, respectively, whether the provider manages more than one project,
whether all projects are located in non-industrialized nations, whether all projects are forestrybased, and whether all projects qualify for inclusion in the Kyoto Protocol.
Table 1 reports the results of all provider-level regression models. The linear and loglinear models in column (a) are the specifications with project-level variables as defined initially.
We find evidence that a provider’s location does have an effect on the price it charges. Offset
providers based in North America sell offsets at lower prices than those based in Europe. The
difference is statistically significant and, according to the two models, suggests a price discount
in North America of $6.91 on average, or a difference of 29 percent. We also find evidence, with
statistical significance in the linear specification, that prices charged by providers located in Australasia are lower than those located in Europe. In this case, the difference is roughly $5.94, or 25
percent on average. There is no statistically significant difference between offset prices of providers located in North American and Australasia.
Another result with statistical significance relates to the effect of CDM or GS certification, which as described above, implies that a project meets certification standards and generates
offsets that qualify for emission reductions under the Kyoto Protocol. Based on the linear model,
the result is interpreted such that a 10-percent increase in the proportion of a provider’s projects
that are CDM- or GS-certified is associated with a $1.33 increase in the provider’s price. It is
important to note, however, that the comparison group here includes offset projects that may, or
may not, have obtained some other certification; but in either case, the offsets would not qualify
for emission reductions under the Kyoto Protocol. The corresponding result in the log-linear
7

We do not account for VCS certification in the provider-level analysis. The reason is that CC does not report a
transparency measure for providers that includes VCS certification. We did, however, separately collect data from
CC on VCS certification and include it in our subsequent project-level analysis.

9

model is that the same 10-percent increase in the proportion of certified projects is associated
with a 5.9-percent increase in the provider’s price.
All other coefficient estimates of interest are not statistically significant, though some attention to their signs is warranted, as it helps to motivate our subsequent project-level analysis.
Not-for-profit providers tend to have higher prices. Providers overseeing more projects tend to
have lower prices. If a greater proportion of the projects are forestry-based, prices tend to be
lower. Finally, the effect of a provider having a greater proportion of its projects in developing or
least-developed nations has an unclear effect on price.
The models in column (b) differ because of variable definitions. As described above, we
redefine numprojectsi as a dummy variable indicating more than one project, and the variables
nonindusti, forestryi, and kyotoi are indicators for whether 100 percent of the provider’s projects
satisfy the respective categorization. We estimate these models to test whether prices are different for the providers with more uniform criteria for their projects. The information presented for
transparency on CC is also formatted in this way. When compared with the models in column
(a), the results also provide a robustness check. In general, both sets of models produce very similar results in terms of the sign and statistical significance of coefficient estimates. The new
specifications produce larger magnitudes on the provider location results, but none of the redefined variables comes through differently with statistical significance. The interpretation of the
coefficient on kyotoi, however, has a sharper interpretation: providers that obtain CDM or GS
certification for all their projects, compared to those that obtain it for some or none of their projects, set offset prices higher by $15.44. Based on the log-linear specification, this is an average
mark-up of 65 percent.

3.2. Project-Level Analysis
The price of a carbon offset is determined at the provider level, but as we have seen, the majority
of providers manage more than one offset project, with the average being 3.6. We now estimate

10

hedonic price functions that take advantage of the more detailed data on individual offset projects.
We begin with estimation of regression models that have the general form
Pi = f (offsettypeij, OECDij, kyotoij, VCSij) + εij,
where the subscript i continues to index providers and j indexes projects. offsettypeij is a categorical variable indicating a project’s mechanism for offsetting emissions, which we aggregate
into seven categories: forestry, industrial methane, biomass methane, wind, hydropower, solar,
and other.8 OECDij is a categorical variable indicating whether the project is located in a nation
with the OECD’s classification of industrialized, developing, or least-developed. kyotoij is a
dummy variable for whether the project has CDM or GS certification, and therefore qualifies for
emission reductions under the Kyoto Protocol. VCSij is a dummy variable for whether the project
has obtained third-party certification from the Voluntary Carbon Standard. Finally, εij is a normally distributed error term. We again estimate and report both linear and log-linear specifications. For the project-level analysis, however, we report standard errors that are clustered at the
provider level. This accounts for the fact that each project is not an entirely independent observation, in large part because prices are available at the provider level only. 9
The first set of models in column (a) of Table 2 includes only the categorical variables on
offset type, with forestry projects as the omitted category. All coefficient estimates are positive,
providing evidence that forestry-based offsets sell at lower prices. In both specifications, statistically significant coefficients are those on the project types of biomass methane, hydropower, solar, and wind. All four have magnitudes that are very similar and are not statistically different
from one another. The general pattern in these models is that offsets of these four types, com-

8

The miscellaneous other category includes offsets in the categories mentioned previously as fuel efficiency, hydropower, fuel substitution, efficient lighting, environmental building, material substitution, public transportation, geothermal power, heat electricity cogeneration, and market-based.
9

It is worth mentioning, as one might expect, that clustering results in substantially larger standard errors, making
statistical inference of the coefficient estimates more conservative.

11

pared to those based on forestry, sell for higher prices between five and eight dollars more on
average. The difference in price ranges between 40 and 50 percent.
The models in column (b) of Table 2 include the variables on the level of development in
the nation where the offset project is located and the different types of third party certification.
When we include these additional variables, the results on differences between forestry and other
offset types are weaker. While all coefficients remain positive, only the one for solar continues to
have statistical significance, such that offsets from solar-power projects sell for an average premium, compared to those based on forestry, of $6.09 or 49 percent. We do find statistically significant differences between offset prices from projects in industrialized and non-industrialized
nations. Those based in developing or least-developed nations sell for higher prices on average,
between three and four dollars per tonne of CO2e, or roughly 20 percent. In these models, the
differences between the prices in developing and least-developed countries are not statistically
significant. Finally, the models show some differences in price as a result of third-party certification. While the coefficient on VCS is not statistically different from zero, the coefficient on CDM
or GS certification is positive and different from zero with a high degree of statistical significance, in parallel with the results of the provider-level analysis. Projects with certification that
qualifies them for emissions reductions under the Kyoto Protocol sell for an average premium of
$8.12 or approximately 41 percent.
We now focus the analysis on forestry-based offsets. We do so because, as discussed previously, forestry-based offsets are very common and tend to be rather controversial. Furthermore,
the results thus far suggest systematic differences in the price of forestry-based offsets. We report
regression models in column (a) of Table 3 that are similar to those in column (b) of Table 2, but
for the fact that we account for differences in the offset type with only a dummy variable for
whether the project is forestry-based. While the estimated coefficient is negative, it is not statistically different from zero. The results for whether projects are located in developing or leastdeveloped nations are very similar to those shown previously, as are those for CDM or GS certi-

12

fication. The main difference between specifications is that the coefficient on VCS certification
is now statistically significant. Compared to the unspecified category of other third-party certification or no certification, projects with VCS certification—the largest certifier—are associated
with a price discount of approximately $4.24 or 19 percent.
The final set of models that we report include interactions between whether the offset
project is forestry based and is located in a developing or least-developed nation. Both of these
interactions have coefficients that are negative and highly statistically significant. The results indicate that forestry-based projects that are located in non-industrialized nations are associated
with substantial price discounts. Compared to those located in industrialized nations, forestrybased offsets in developing nations sell for prices that are lower by $5.46 on average, or approximately 39 percent. The difference is even greater for forestry-based projects in leastdeveloped nations, where the average discount compared to industrialized nations is $11.16, or
nearly 70 percent. The forestry-based difference between developing and least-developed nations is also statistically significant (F = 4.46, p = 0.038), indicating an average price difference
of $4.70. In these specifications, we also find that the non-forestry difference between developing and least-developed nations is statistically significant (F = 3.01, p = 0.087). Considering all
other offset types, average offset prices are $2.83 or 17 percent higher in least-developed nations
compared to developing nations, and both remain significantly higher than the average price in
industrialized nations.

4. Discussion
We now broaden our discussion of the main empirical findings to explore possible explanations.
Before doing so, however, we acknowledge that interpretation of our results is susceptible to the
classic identification problem that arises when estimating hedonic price functions (see Freeman
1993). In theory, each of the prices we observe for carbon offsets are consistent with the intersection of supply and demand, but the identification problem means that variability in prices cannot

13

be definitively attributed to either shifts in demand or supply. In practice, this means that, for example, a variable associated with higher prices in the hedonic price function could be operating
through an increase in costs (decrease in supply) or greater willingness to pay on the part of consumers (increase in demand). With this caution in mind, we turn to mechanisms that might explain the main results.
Among the more robust findings of our analysis is that the location of both providers and
projects has a significant effect on offset prices. All providers included in the dataset are located
in industrialized nations, but those located in Europe sell offsets for an average premium of nearly 30 percent. Many factors may be contributing to this price differential. Both awareness about
climate change and agreement on the need to take action are perhaps greater in Europe than anywhere else in the world. Moreover, as discussed previously, GHG emissions are regulated
throughout the European Union, and offsets are allowed as part of both industrial and national
compliance strategies. Each of these factors, along with a potential preference for more regional
offset providers, may contribute to an increase in demand, and therefore price, of carbon offsets
sold by European providers.
Somewhat more surprising is the way that the location of projects themselves affects
prices. When considering all types of offset projects, we find that projects occurring in developing and least-developing nations are significantly more expensive than those taking place in industrialized nations, by an average of nearly 20 percent. Assuming that these nations do not have
the most current technology in place, one might expect the cost of emissions abatement in these
nations to be lower than that in industrialized nations. This is, after all, the economic rationale for
the Kyoto Protocol’s CDM. But our empirical results, which show higher prices in nonindustrialized nations, are not consistent with this line of reasoning. One possible explanation for
the price premium associated with offsets in non-industrialized nations is the desire for wealth
redistribution, i.e., poverty alleviation, on the part of offset buyers in voluntary carbon markets.
The plausibility of this explanation is strengthened even further by the fact that in some specifi-

14

cations, we also find significantly higher offset prices when projects are located in leastdeveloped nations compared to developing nations. It is also the case that establishing and managing offset projects in non-industrialized nations can have further challenges that increase the
cost due to weaker institutional arrangements.10
Among all the types of offset projects considered in the dataset, forestry-based projects
are the most common. It is also the case that forestry-based projects are the most controversial.
As discussed previously, concerns tend to focus in particular on whether projects that seek to
avoid deforestation or promote reforestation are legitimately additional, permanent, or both. At
the same time, forestry-based projects are frequently promoted because of associated co-benefits.
In addition to carbon sequestration, standing forests provide additional benefits in the form of
wildlife habitat and ecosystem services more generally (Foley et al. 2005; Myers 1997). 11 We
nevertheless find some evidence that forestry-based offsets sell for lower prices than offsets of
other types, perhaps reflecting greater uncertainty about additionality and permanence. The
stronger result, however, is that forestry-based offsets sell for substantially lower prices than offsets of other types when projects are located in non-industrialized nations, with average prices
lower by 40 and 70 percent in developing and least-developed nations, respectively. With respect
to uncertainty, these results may reflect how these nations often lack the institutions required to
ensure the quality of forestry offsets, such as secure property rights, good governance, and monitoring infrastructure. Furthermore, lower prices in non-industrialized nations may be related to
the lower opportunity costs of land in developing and least-developed nations when kept in for-

10

Though not reported in the paper, we also estimated project-level regression models that included a variable for
the level of corruption in the host nation. The corruption variable was based on Transparency International’s 2008
Corruption Perceptions Index, available at www.icgg.org. Though we did not find that corruption is associated with
higher offset prices, the results for price differences based on OECD classification continue to hold after controlling
for corruption.
11

We also estimated, though do not report, project-level regression models that included a variable that attempted to
capture the biodiversity benefits associated with the forestry-based projects. This indicator variable was created
from the project descriptions on the CC website, based on appearance of the terms “native species,” “native forest,”
or “restoration” in the description. We were unable to identify any impact on price due to the type of forestry project
pursued.

15

ests. Distinguishing between these potential explanations for the lower price of forestry-based
offsets in non-industrialized nations is critical, as there is significant international momentum to
incorporate reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) offsets in the next
round of climate negotiations, and these decisions will have important implications for both
GHG emissions and land use in the future (see, for example, Miles and Kapos 2008).
Demonstrating that offsets represent actual reductions in GHG emissions is essential for
the long-term viability of offsets in both a regulatory and voluntary setting. In order to address
the information asymmetry that exists between offset providers and buyers, emphasis is increasingly being placed on the importance of developing standards and establishing third-party certifiers to ensure the credibility of provider claims. Such certification might be expected to increase
the price of offsets for reasons related to both supply and demand. Obtaining certification and/or
complying with standards is not only costly; the additional information conveyed through certification might also increase a buyer’s willingness to pay. Our results, however, suggest that the
impact of certification on offset prices depends on the certifier.
A robust finding is that CDM or GS certification has a positive effect on offset prices,
with estimates of the premium ranging between 30 and 65 percent. Whether this is driven by
greater costs or greater willingness to pay is unclear, but a unique feature of these two certifications is that the offsets qualify for emission reductions under the Kyoto Protocol. This feature
clearly has an additional benefit in a regulated setting, and to the extent that offsets with this certification are selling in the voluntary market, the premium indicates that offset buyers do in fact
attach value to CDM and GS certification. We do not find a similar result for VCS certification.
In fact, we find some evidence that VCS certification, the largest non-regulatory certifier, is associated with lower offset prices, when compared to offset projects that are either uncertified or
certified by some unspecified other third-party. We do not have a good explanation for this result,
though it is consistent with simple descriptive statistics reported in Hamilton et al. (2009), where
prices are lower for VCS certified projects than for projects with other third-party certification or

16

no certification. One potential explanation for the VCS discount is that VCS certification, compared to other certifications or no certification, may not allay concerns about additionality, permanence, and verifiability. Other possible explanations range from low costs of compliance with
potentially weak VCS standards, an omitted variable in our analysis that is correlated with VCS
certification and associated with lower prices, and the general possibility, discussed more below,
that prices are not closely related to marginal costs because of a thin market.

5. Summary and Conclusion
The primary aim of this paper is to investigate factors that help explain the large variability in the
price of voluntary carbon offsets. Using data listed on the Carbon Catalog (CC), we estimate hedonic price functions using a variety of provider- and project-level characteristics as explanatory
variables. We find that providers located in Europe sell offsets at prices that are approximately 30
percent higher than providers located in either North American or Australasia. Contrary to what
one might expect, offset prices are generally higher, by roughly 20 percent, when projects are
located in developing or least-developed nations. But this result does not hold for forestry-based
projects. We find evidence that forestry-based offsets sell at lower prices, and the result is particularly strong when projects are located in developing or least-developed nations. Offsets that
are Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) or Gold Standard (GS) certified, and therefore qualify under the Kyoto Protocol, sell at a premium of more than 30 percent, while third-party certification from the Voluntary Carbon Standard (VCS), one of the largest certifiers, is associated
with a price discount. Variables that do not have a significant effect on offset prices are the number of projects that a provider manages and a provider’s status as for-profit or not-for-profit.
We base our analysis on offset providers and projects listed on CC, which to our knowledge is the most comprehensive listing of sellers in the voluntary, over-the-counter offset market.
While the CC dataset continues to expand and others will surely emerge, future research should
take advantage of greater sources of data. We expect that such centralized listings that increase

17

transparency will also promote more competition in the offset market, the potential lack of which
is a limitation of the analysis carried out here. Despite several robust findings, the market for
carbon offsets is still relatively new, and one might reasonably question whether the market is
thick enough for competitive pressures to be driving price differences. We also recognize, at least
in the voluntary offset market, that the motives of buyers may range from a desire to alleviate
personal guilt, to purchase so-called “charismatic carbon,” to redistribute wealth, or to pursue
strategies for corporate environmental management. Also at play are other important variables
that we cannot measure directly, such as continuing concerns about additionality, permanence,
and credibility. In conclusion, we emphasize that carbon offsets should be considered a bundle of
characteristics well suited to hedonic analysis, and understanding what drives prices in this market is increasingly important. In this paper we have made a first attempt, one we hope spurs future research that keeps up with a growing market and takes advantage of expanded sources of
data.
