Considerable empirical evidence has been presented (e.g., Waud (1970)) to
support the assertion that discount rate changes contain "announcement
effects" concerning the future course of monetary policy which significantly

affect security prices.1 Roley and Troll (1984) contend that the validity of
this assertion depends on the operating procedures employed by the monetary

authorities, Specifically, they present an analytical framework which
demonstrates that with a policy of interest rate targeting, which
characterized open market operating procedures prior to October 1979 (pre—79),

no meaningful announcement effects are possible since any effects on nrket
rates would be offset by changes in the level of nonborrowed reserves. Under
nonborrowed reserve targeting, which has characterized post-October 1979
(post—79) monetary policy, changes in discount rates affect interest rates

directly via (at least) changes in the expected short-run money path.

Consistent with this view, Roley and Troll report no nnonco ffe&-c

from discount rate changes on the term structure of interest rates from
September 1977 to October 1979, but a significant announcement effect over the
October 1979 to October 1982 period characterized by increases (decreases) in

bond yields being associated with discount rate increases (decreases). Pearce
and Roley (1984) report similar results for stock returns over the identical

time period. Specifically, they find no announcement effect in the pre—
October 1979 period, but significant negative (positive) stock returns
associated with the announcement of discount rate increases (decreases) in the
later period.

One difficulty with these studies is the assertion that discount rate

changes are unexpected; that is, discount rate changes are exogenous. This is
in contrast to both Lombra and Torto (1977) and Froyen (1975) who present
evidence that the discount rates is a function of open market interest rates

2

and member bank borrowing. Santomero (1983) and the papers cited therein
describe current discount rate policy as passive and responding with a lag to

changes in open market rates. The evidence from these studies suggest that
discount rate changes are endogenous, and that even if these changes coincide
with a recent revision in monetary policy objectives, the policy revision

would already be incorporated into market yields. There would be no
announcement effect under either operating procedure, since no new information
is provided by the announcement.

The presence of an announcement effect associated with an endogenous
(anticipated) discount rate change suggests that securities markets may not be

(semi—strong) efficient. Such a finding would be in stark contrast to the
numerous studies that either assume market efficiency for the purpose of
hypothesis testing or provide empirical evidence in support of market

efficiency.2 Further, the usefulness of the discount rate as a monetary
policy instrument is questionable if endogenous changes generate announcement
effects.

The primary purpose of this paper is to reconcile the previous findings
of discount rate endogerieity with the presence of discount rate announcement

effects in securities markets. The crux of this reconciliation is the
distinction between "technical" discount rate changes that are endogenous and
"non—technical" changes which contain some informative policy implications.
In essence, we attempt to separate expected discount rate changes from

unexpected changes, or equivalently, the expected component of discount rate

changes from the unexpected component. If markets are efficient, the former
should have no announcement effects while the latter may be associated with an

announcement effect.3 Accordingly, the focus of the empirical analysis is on
the interaction between discount rate exogeneity, the specific monetary policy

3

regime, and announcement effects. In addition, we examine whether the
behavior of these markets in the post—announcement period

is

consistent with

the rapid price adjustment implied by market efficiency.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents
a brief discussion of the theoretical link between discount rate changes and
market returns as well as a description of the data and methodology.
Preliminary tests reported in this section using our longer sample period

confirm the Roley and Troll and Pearce and Roley findings: a significant
announcement effect characterizes the post-79 period but there is no reaction

of securities markets to discount rate changes in the pre—79 period. The next
two sections

refine

the analysis to distinguish between technical and

nontechnical discount rate changes. Section III provides a description of the
classification scheme that we employ to identify technical and nontechnical

aiscounc race changes. Section IV extends Ute empirical tests of ectin II
using this classification. We find that in the pre—79 period there was no
securities markets response to either technical or nontechnical changes while

in the post79 period there was no response to technical changes. Only
nontechnical changes occurring in the post—79 period were characterized by

significant announcement effects. In Section V we test and find that there is
some evidence of a significant price adjustment in the day immediately
following the actual announcement, but no price adjustment beyond this first

day. Section VI contains our summary and conclusions.

II. Theoretical Framework and Preliminary Results
Discount rate changes will affect market rates and equity returns if such
changes convey new information about either short or long-run monetary policy

objectives. Roley and Troll argue that an increase in the discount rate that
changes the implied short-run money path would be associated with an objective

4

of returning to an implied long-run money growth path more quickly. As a
result, current (spot) and expected short—term rates rise in reaction to

reduced short-run money growth. Long—term rates and forward rates may also
increase to reflect the higher expected short-term rates. The opposite effect
on interest rates is expected for discount rate decreases. An increase in the
discount rate that changes only long—run monetary policy objectives would be
associated with a decline in long-run trend money growth, reducing expected

inflation and lowering future expected short-term rates. This implies no
change

in current short—term rates and a decline in long-term rates and

forward rates. The opposite is expected for discount rate declines. If the
perception of both short and

long-run policy objectives is changed, a discount

rate increase (decrease) may be

expected to be associated with an increase in

short—term rates but an ambiguous effect on forward rates and long—term
rts. ly nd Tr1l find increases (decreases) in the thonnt rate rsiiTt
in increases (decreases) in short—term and long—term rates, leading them to
conclude that the observed announcement effect is associated with changes in
short—run monetary policy objectives.

The impact of discount rate changes on equity prices can operate through

two possible channels. This is most readily seen by viewing the value of the
firm as the present value of its future net cash flows. To the extent
discount rate increases (decreases) result in increases (decreases) in
interest rates, the rate at which the firm's cash flows are capitalized will
rise (fall) with a subsequent negative (positive) effect on stock prices.

Additionally, discount rate changes can alter expectations of future cash

flows.

Specifically, discount rate changes that increase or decrease real

economic activity will alter cash flow expectations in the same direction.

One would expect that to the extent both capitalization rates and cash flow

5

expectations are affected by discount rate changes, these effects will work in

the same direction.4 Given the Roley and Troll findings discussed above, we
expect stock price declines to be associated with discount rate increases, a
finding that would be in agreement with the results reported by Pearce and
Roley.

To assess the impact of discount rate changes on interest rates and stock
prices, we utilize an event-time methodology that is similar to that employed
by Roley and Troll in their paper and by Urich and Wachtel (1981), Roley
(1983) and Pearce and Roley (1983) in their studIes of financial market

where R1t is the percentage change in the relevant interest rate or in stock
prices observed on announcement day t of a discount rate change and is
measured from the close of day t -

to the close of day t. ARDt is the

percentage change in the discount rate announced on day t, For the purposes
of this study, the announcement day is the day the discount rate change was

reported in the Wall Street Journal. Our tests for differences in financial
market reaction according to technical or nontechnical classification, as well
as the investigation of financial market speed of adjustment issue use
variants of (1) that are described in the following sections.

The time period for this study is the eight year period from 1975 — 1982

(no discount rate changes in 1983). Over this period there were 36 discount
rate changes, 18 of which occurred prior to October 1979. Twenty—three of
these changes were increases and 13 were decreases. Table 1 provides a
reakdown of the discount rate change data based on the size of the change and
the period in which it occurred. The data indicate a clear shift toward

that under quite reasonable

theoretical specifications the risk and maturity structure of interest rates
is better modelled in terms of the so-called discount factor, which is simply

one plus the rate of interest. Accordingly, the percentge changes in both the
interest rate and discount rate series are calculated as the percentage change
in one plus the interest rate.5

As an initial test, we estimate equation (1) over the pre—79 and post—79

periods for each of nine return series.6 The estimates of the market response
coefficient

are reported in Table 2. Our results confirm the Roley and

Troll and Pearce and Roley findings. For the equity series, there is no
significant market response in the pre—79 period but over the post—79 period
there is a significant negative (positive) response to discount rate increases

7

(decreases).

The magnitude of the response coefficient suggests that a 100

basis point change in the discount rate results in approximately a one percent
change in stock prices on the announcement day, almost identical to the
magnitude reported by Pearce and Roley.

A similar finding is reported for the interest rate data. Only one
interest rate series evidences a significant market reaction in the pre—79
period, while six of the eight interest rates indicate a significant market

response over the post-79 period.7 The pattern of coefficients suggests a
larger effect on short—term rates than on forward rates with a positive

response on each rate. This finding supports the view that discount rate
changes affect expectations about short—run monetary policy objectives.
Finally, the magnitude of the response coefficients mirror that of Roley and

Classification of Discount Rate Changes
The previous discussion clearly indicates that to properly assess the

announcement effects of discount rate changes it is necessary to distinguish
technical from nontechnical changes. Roley and Troll recognize this and
attempt to explain daily discount rate changes via a regression equation,
relating

such changes to changes in the Fed Funds rate •

Due

to the low

explanatory power of the equation, they are led to conclude that the entire
change in the discount

rate is unexpected; that is, all discount rate changes

are nontechnical.9 This finding is also used by Pearce and Roley to justify

their

assumption of discount rate exogeneity.
There are several shortcomings with this approach, however, that limit

its usefulness in predicting discount rate changes and cast substantial doubt

on the assumption of discount rate exogeneity. First, the current method of
ch.ancTina

the

discount rate requires the approval of the Executive Committee of

the Federal Reserve Banks board of directors, which are contacted by phone

every two weeks. Accordingly, the discount rate can only be changed at most
one day every two weeks. This implies a daily model of discount rate changes
is,

in some sense, attempting to capture a biweekly event so

that such a model

is unlikely to yield good forecasts. A second shortcoming is the tenuous
nature of constructing any reduced form model, This is particularly important
in modelling discount rate changes where there are nonquantifiable factors,

such as public statements by Federal Reserve officials, that may affect

expectations concerning discount rate changes. Third, given the discrete
nature

is

of discount rate changes and the volatility of the Fed Funds rate,

also not surprising that both the

it

explanatory and predictive power of such

an equation is low. Indeed, despite the infrequent changes in the discount
rate, the extent of Fed Funds variability suggests that non—zero predictions

9

of

discount rate change are present for every day. Finally, as suggested by

points one and three, the

inability

to forecast the precise day of a discount

rate change, as such models attempt to do, does not necessarily mean that
changes in the discount rate are mostly unexpected, but only that their exact
timing cannot be predicted.

Given the above, we rely on two different methods to classify discount

rate changes. The first is a statistical model that attempts to avoid or at
least mitigate the shortcomings of the Roley and Troll discount rate change
model.

In our approach, we use weekly and not daily data, since the former is

more consistent with Federal Reserve operating procedures. If the model
specification is RD = f(.), then the anticipated or technical component of an
actual discount rate change is f(.) and the unanticipated or nontechnical
component is ,RD —

f(.),

which is simply the error term from the xwdel. To

1-h rrcts to daily forecasts we assume that a discount rate
change predicted in week t is anticipated regardless of the day in week t it
is actually announced and an unanticipated discount rate change in week t is a
surprise regardless of the day it is announced.

Several different specifications were estimated, including variants of

those used by Roley and Troll, Lombra and Torto and by Brown (1981). One
notable finding is the rejection of model stability over the pre-79 arid post-

79 periods. In all cases, the mean square error was at least twice as large
in the

latter period. The best model, both

in terms of in—sample fit and

predicting actual discount rate changes, related changes in the discount rate
(measured

in basis points) to the spread between the Fed Funds rate and the

discount rate (denoted SPREAD) over the last four weeks and changes in member

bank borrowing, calculated for week t

to t (denoted BORRGW), over the last four weeks. The results of this model

a substantial improvement over Roley and Troll. Given the discrete

nature of discount rate changes it is not surprising that the magnitude of

actual discount rate changes is always underpredicted. Nonetheless, if the
model incorporates the relevant information set, then by construction the
forecasts are optimal predictions based on available information and,
therefore, rational.

The second method for classifying discount rate changes is much simpler

and more straightforward. When the Federal Reserve Board changes the discount
rate, it states the reason for its action in a press release at the time of

the discount rate change. For the purpose of this paper, technical changes
are those purportedly taken entirely to bring the discount rate in closer
alignment

with money market rates. All other changes, even if

interpretation presented in the

Wall Street Journal, which may more accurately

technical

and nontechnical elements. Accordingly, one possible explanation

for the endogeneity—announcement effect anomaly is that the endogeneity
finding reflects technical changes and the technical elements of nontechnical
changes, while the nontechnical changes are responsible for the observed

announcement effect. Our criteria for a discount rate change to be classified
as technical has the effect of biasing against a finding that nontechnical
changes exert a stronger effect on financial markets.
These two technologies for classifying discount rate changes are distinct
in that the statistical method explicitly divides every discount rate change
into a technical and a nontechnical component, whereas our specification of
the

change as either technical or nontechnical. Since discount rate

in modelling discussed above, however, the Federal Reserve

of discount rate changes. It is an empirical question as to which is the
superior approach.

Despite the differences in determining technical and nontechnical
composition, if both classification schemes reflect market expectations then
there should be some degree

of consistency across the models. That is, if

the

statistical method indicates that a large percentage of a discount rate change
is unanticipated (anticipated) then we would expect the FRA method to classify

the change as nontechnical (technical). If this

is true, the correlation

coefficients between the percentage of a discount rate change classified as
technical

under one method with the percentage of a discount rate change

classified as nontechnical under the alternative method should be negative,

12

while the correlation coefficients of like classifications between methods

should be positive. This is, in fact, the case. The former correlation
coefficients are —.442 and the latter are .442.12

IV. Empirical Results

Of the 18 pre—79 discount rate changes, 11 are classified as
nontechnical, while of the 18 post—79 discount rate changes, 12 are classified

as nontechnical.13 To begin the analysis, equation (1) is respecified to
capture the technical/nontechnical classifications:

In (2a), RDT (RDNT) is that amount of a given discount rate change that is
classified as technical (nontechnical) according to the statistical model. In
(2b) T(NT) is a dummy variable equal to one if the discount rate change is
classified as technical (nontechnical) according to the FRAC method and zero

otherwise. All other variables in (2a) and (2b) are as previously defined.

Our expectations about the coefficient T and

periods form directly from the monetary policy regime and market efficiency

we expect

= o since, regardless of classification, a discount rate

change is not required, and will not by itself change the level of market

interest rates. Given the results reported in Table 2, for the post—79 period

we expect T = 0 for both interest rates and equity prices and NT > 0 for
interest rates and

and

< 0 for the equity return series. The expectations

are the same as for

and NT' respectively.

13

The results of estimating equations (2) for the two subperiods are
reported in Table 4. For the pre—79 period there is virtually no evidence of
announcement effects, regardless of either classification or the

classification method. When (2a) is estimated, only four of the response
coefficients are significant at the ten percent level and one at the five

percent level. Of the three significant coefficients on IRDNT, only one has

the theoretically expected positive sign. Using the FRA method, in only two
instances is

nontechnical

or

significant and the coefficient associated with

changes has the wrong sign. As expected, discount rate changes,

regardless of whether or not they are anticipated, do not affect market rates
under interest rate targeting (pre—79).

classification methods. Not surprisingly, for the seven significant response
coefficients, both

and '

are larger (in absolute value) than the

response coefficients reported in Table 2. While the results reported in
Table 2 mirror Roley and Troll and Pearce and Roley in implying a 100 basis
point increase in the discount rate results in a 50 basis point increase in
R90 and a one percent decline in stock prices, we find that nontechnical

14

increases of identical magnitude increase 'o by 70 basis points and reduce
stock prices by 1.6 percent.

These results provide strong support for the hypothesis that the market
responds differently to discount rate changes depending on whether they are

viewed as technical or nontechnical. That is, there is a significant
announcement effect associated with discount rate changes that provide the
market with new information, while there is no discernible announcement effect

associated with technical discount rate changes. This finding is consistent

an endogenous discount rate coexisting with announcement effects. Technical

discount rate changes are, by definition, endogenous. Nontechnical discount
rate changes actually consist of both technical and nontechnical elements.

ccrdir;ly, it is not surprising that discount rate chan'es as a whole fail
tests of statistical exogeneity. On the other hand, the announcement effect
reported here and in previous studies for the post—79 period for discount rate
changes as a whole seems to be due to inappropriately treating all discount

rate changes the same. Specifically, the results of this paper suggest that
the observed announcement effect is due only to nontechnical elements while

the technical elements do not generate a market reaction. The discount rate
endogeneity—announceiflent effect anomaly is not an anomaly at all and is simply

due to a misspecification.15

changes depends on the monetary policy regime, the implication is that only
nontechnical post—79 discount rate changes should yield announcement

effects. The empirical evidence of this paper supports this view and suggests
previous studies were misspecified by not controlling for the purpose of the
discount rate change.

The evidence also implies that the common assumption, contained in
virtually all theoretical and empirical macroeconomic models, that the
discount rate is either purely endogenous or purely exogenous, is

inappropriate. in addition, our findings may have some bearing on the
continuing debate over the usefulness of the discount rate as a tool for

macroeconomic policy. One argument against its use has been that it can
generate perverse announcement effects because the public, as Waud (1970, p.
250) states, reads "broader economic implications into even 'routine technical

.nnnt'"

Th

evidence here

indicates

that this is not the se

Markets react only when there appears to be a shift in policy-—which is when a
market

reaction is desirable——and not to technical adjustments in the discount

rate. At least from this
a

standpoint, one cannot rule out the discount rate as

useful tool of monetary policy.
Finally,

the

our results support the existence of efficient markets based on

dual finding that only nontechnical changes are characterized by

announcement effects and that virtually the entire market adjustment occurs by
the end of the

announcement day.

FOOTNOTES

1For other studies that have reported significant announcement effects of

discount rate changes on a variety of securities markets, see Baker and Meyer
(1980), and Brown (1981), as well as those discussed in the text.
2For a discussion of market efficiency and a review of some relevant
literature, see Fama (1970) and Copeland and Wes ton (1979).

3This is a much stronger statement than is actually necessary.
Specifically, although a technical change in the discount rate may be known
changes have real
with certainty, its timing may not. Since discount rate
effects, this timing uncertainty may give rise to an announcement effect in
some markets even for endogenous discount rate changes. If timing uncertainty
is at least as great for nontechnical changes as it is for technical changes,
market efficiency would lead us to assert that the announcement effect of a
Our
nontechnical change exceeds that associated with a technical change.
discussion in the text, which can be viewed as assuming no timing uncertainty,
is one example of this assertion and, given the empirical findings, simplifies
the exposition of the paper. it is important, however, to be aware of the
timing issue and to recognize that an announcement effect associated with
discount rate changes is appropriately viewed as a necessary but not
sufficient condition to assert that the market is inefficient.
41n principle, one could separate out the numerator and denominator
effects of discount rate changes on stock prices. Such an analysis, however,
involves rather heroic assumptions and would be, at most, of tangential
relevance to our research.

61n the post—79 period there was either an imposition of or an increase
in a surcharge on discount window borrowing on the same announcement day as
three discount rate changes. To control for this, the estimation of all
equations over the post—79 period includes a dummy variable equal to one when
the surcharge change is announced on the same day as a discount rate change
and is zero otherwise. Exclusion of this variable does not change our
results.

8The results in Table 2 indicate clearly that the size of the discount
change is an important determinant of asset price reaction. To examine
finding further, we tested whether only the announcement of a discount
change, regardless of magnitude, explains asset price reaction. This was
via estimation of the equation.

epect C= 0 and 8 to be as discussed in the text. In all cases,

significaCntly different from zero and 8 was similar in magnitude and
significance to the results reported in Table 2. This finding provides
further support for the specification given in equation (1).
9Roley and Troll find that only when the fed funds rate increases by at
least 100 basis points is there a significant relationship between changes in
the fed funds rate and changes in the discount rate. Further, negative
movements in the fed funds rate do not indicate any significant relationship
between changes in the fed funds rate and changes in the discount rate.
10We used the Federal Reserve press release to classify this
controversial discount rate change, which occurred on February 5, 1975.
Classification according to the Wall Street Journal's interpretation made
virtually no difference in the results.

There are, however, at least two difficulties that are more severe for
the statistical method. In some sense, every week where a discount rate
change is not made has a "non—announcement" effect that could effect security
prices. This difficulty, of course, will characterize any study of
announcement effects when the timing of the announcement is not a priori
known. Additionl1y, discount rctc changes have been 25. 50 or 100 basis
points, but predictions of the statistical model may be any amount, so that
some predictions of discount rate changes (e.g., 11 basis points) may be
unrealistic. It may be more appropriate, then, to view the statistical method
as reflecting the probability of a discount rate change multiplied by the size
of the expected change. This suggests possibly using a logit model to
estimate probabilities of discount rate changes. Such a model would still be
characterized by the first difficulty and, further, there is no control for
size

or direction unless even more complexity is added via a multinomial logit

model.

2The correlation between the percentage of technical components and
between nontechnical components across models are equal, and the correlation
between the technical and nontechnical components of the models equal in
magnitude

but of opposite sign to the like correlations, because using
percentages normalizes all discount rate changes to be the same size and the
two classifications must sum to one.
This, of course, does not hold if magnitudes are used instead of
percentages. The former are sensitive to the absolute size of discount rate
change. Since it is likely that both technical and nontechnical components
will increase with the absolute size of a discount rate change, a positive
correlation between the technical and nontechnical classifications of the two
methods could result. Even so, we expect the like classifications of the two
models to be more highly correlated than the opposite classifications. Using
magnitudes, the correlation between technical (nontechnical) classifications
of the two models is .70 (.86), while the correlation between technical
(nontechnical) classifications from the statistical method and nontechnical

21

(technical) classification from the FRA method is .50 (.57). This finding
further reflects the consistency of the two models.
13The data on technical and nontechnical discount rate changes is
available from the authors upon request.
14The only case where a significant increase (at the five percent level)
in explanatory power is not observed using the FRA method is for the 5r2
forward rate. When the statistical analysis is employed, the explanatory
power of equations using the forward rates 3r2, 7r3 and 10r10 actually
declines.
150ne conjecture consistent with the empirical evidence and perhaps with
future investigation is the notion that all discount rate changes are
technical in nature but the policy authorities choose the discount rate

announcement as an opportunity to signal changes in the direction and/or
magnitude of monetary policy. Several readers suggested t'e

alternative

view,

consistent with the above conjecture, that while all discount rate changes are
to some extent endogenous, nontechnical changes arise because of changes in or
uncertainty about the policy rule or the Federal Reserve reaction function.

16 of these interest rates, 5r2 and 7r3, evidence no announcement
effect on day t. This finding may be due to relatively thin trading of
instruments in this maturity range so that the effect of discount rate changes
is not fully reflected in prices until after day t. The existence of thin
trading also implies abnormal returns could not be earned based on a trading
strategy implemented on day t.
17This assertion assumes no timing uncertainty, otherwise, as previously
noted, an endogenous discount rdte geneating an announcement effect is not
necessarily an indication of market inefficiency.
