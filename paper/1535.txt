ABSTRACT

analyzes some aspects

(such as tariffs,

when the quantity of the imported good is endogenous, and the

foreign producer is a monopolist. It uses a fairly general model
based on the work of Spence and Sheshinski.

A crucial determinant of the direction of these effects is shown
to be the valuation of increments in quality by marginal consumers,
relative to that of all consumers on average. A way of comparing infinitesimal equivalent policies is developed and used to compare import
equivalent policies. For reasonable characterizations of demand —
tariffs are shown to dominate quotas on the basis of their revenue effects alone, while quotas are shown to dominate tariffs on the basis
of their quality effects alone. Also, quality controls are shown to
dominate both tariffs and quotas on the basis of revenue effects alone
for reasonable characterizations of demand. Some special cases are
also analyzed, including the case where demand is modelled along the
lines of Scori and cclv services of the good produced matter to
consumers.

TARIFFS VS. QUOTAS JITh ENDOGENOLS QUALITY

Introduction
This paper

tions

analyzes

some aspects of the effects of trade restric-

and their desirability when the quality of the imported good(s) is

endogenous, and the foreign producer has market power.

Typically, a firm

must

decide on the rnmiber of products produced

and their qualities. By introducing many qualities a producer could
target products to groups of consumers and make greater profits by doing

so. However, there are likely to be significant costs associated with

producing

many qualities,1 and to this extent the producer would want

to produce one product targeted to all consumers.

This discussion suggests two aspects of a producer's choice of poten-

tial interest. The first relates to how the producer when faced with
diverse consumers chooses one good which is best suited to the group as
a whole, and how this aspect of his choice is affected by trade restric—

tions. The second relates to the pricing of a product line —— and the
effects of trade restrictions on such pricing policies. I will deal

with the first in this paper. The second is dealt with in a companion

paper. (See Krishna 0984).)
Existing work in the trade literature on the effects of trade restric-

tions with endogenous quality focuses mainly on the nature of these effects

in a competitive world. The specifications of the models are therefore

particularly

suited to the perfectly competitive paradigm. Unfortunately,

they also tend to obscure some significant aspects of firm behavior in
an imperfectly competitive world.

—2—
Previous srk by IDdriguez (1980) and Santoni and Van Cott

(1980),

for example, deals with these questions in the context of a specific

model (associated with Swan (1970)), where demand is for services of the
good only, and higher quality goods are more durable.

This specifica-

tion simplifies the analysis considerably. As only the quantity of services matters to the constmier, questions regarding the composition of

the product line, or those regarding targeting products to groups of

consters do not arIse at all! ly one quality is produced ——

that

which minimizes the unit cost of producing services when the optimal
level of services is being

produced.

In their model, quotas cause

quality upgrading, while ad—valorem tariffs do not. Although this
accords well with empirical work (see Turner

(1983),

Feenstra (1982)),

their reason Is related to cost rather than demand conditions. An
alternative reason, based on demand conditions,emerges from my analy—

us. This reason is related to quality being chosen so that it is best
suited to all consumers who are served.
Hence, it seems
tions with

well

fair

to argue that while the effects of trade restric-

endogenous quality have been studied, the issues are far from

understood, especially in the context of imperfectly competitive

markets.

An advantage of the Swan model is that the comparison of various
policies can be made with the aid of a two—dimensional diagram. This

is not possible in a more general model. Hence, the techniques used
in this paper cannot be only diagramatic. In this paper) I develop a
simple way to compare various infinitesimal policies. These comparisons
are illustrated using diagrams whenever possible.

—3—

In

the first part of this paper, I consider the effect of trade

restrictions when the market structure is that of foreign monopoly, and
only one quality is produced —— so

all

that the product

must be targeted to

consumers. Quality is modeled in a general way as a factor that

ratses

the willingness to pay for a unit ——

as

in Spence (1976) and

Sheshinski (1976). In contrast to the results obtained using the Swan

specification (which is a special case of this specification), quotas
do not necessarily raise qualities and tariffs do not leave the quality

of imports unaffected. The effect on quality of a quantitative restriction is shown to depend on the valuation of quality increments by the
marginal consumer as compared to the average valuation of quality incre-

ments by all consumers. If the marginal valuation of a quality increment exceeds the average, quality downgrading occurs as the result of
the

quota.

If the reverse is true, quality is upgraded in response to

the quota. The intuition behind this result is straightforward. A binding quota removes the marginal consumer from the market. If this consumer

valued quality less (more) than the average consumer, the benefit to the

monopolist of raising quality exceeds (falls short of) the cost of raising
quality

and it is in the monopolist's interest to raise (lower) quality.

Similarly, the effect of a minimum quality level is to raise
(lower) output, if the valuation of an increment in quality by the

marginal conser exceeds (falls short of) that of the average.
An ad—valorem tariff affects the monopolist's decision on both out-

put and quality and this couplicates the result. If the valuation of an

increment in quality by the marginal conser is more than the average,
quality is downgraded, but the reverse is no longer true.

-.4-.

In

the second section the effect on welfare of any restriction is

decomposed into its components namely that via output, quality, and revenue.

Irrespective of whether quotas raise or lower quality their welfare effects
via quality alone are shown to be beneficial. When import equivalent
policies are compared, the ranking of policies is shown to depend on

whether quotas raise or lower quality and on whether tariffs lower the

volume of imports or not. In the "normal" case, when quotas raise quality

and tariffs lower imports, tariffs dominate quotas on the basis of their

quality effects alone, while quotas dominate tariffs on the basis of their
revenue effects alone. It is also shown that quality controls dominate

both tariffs and quotas on the basis of quality effects alone, as long as
a tariff reduces imports.

while Pq() is the valuation of an increment in quality by

the marginal consumer. The following interpretation of P

(as given

by Spence) is illuminating in this context. In Spence's words:

"xq is the change in Pq as one moves dow-n the slectruni of
consumers ordered by their willignness to pay. If P
< 0
the marginal value of quality falls as absolute willingness to

pay falls. en this is true, the average value attached to
quality exceeds the marginal consumers valuation."3

Lowering output removes the marginal consumer from the market.
If the marginal consumer values quality less than the average value
attached to quality, it is in the interest of the monopolist to

raise (lower) quality, as shown by equation (l.5).

Raving derived the effects of different kinds of restrictions on
the quality and output choices of a monopolist, it is appropriate to
relate the results In this section to previous work in the area.
Trade theorists, in discussing the effect of trade restrictions
on quality, have focused attention on models of perfect competition,

and on the demand characterization associated with Swan (1970). The

assmiption in such dels is that demand is essentially for services
produced by the goods, and higher quality goods have greater durability

and hence produce more services. As a result, the questions regarding

product lines and choice of characteristi's do not arise at all. ly
the quality that minimizes cost per—unit of services will be produced.

Quality choice is completely determined by cost conditions. This
characterization is somewhat unappealing as it asst.es that the quality
dimension cannot be used by the monopolist in his interests.

An ad—'alor tariff does not affect this choice of quality, but a
quota does in the Swan model. The intuition behind this result is as

follows. The quota,

— 10 —

when binding, can be thought of as having a shadow price associated with

it. The effect of raising q on cost per unit of a aervice is, to the
first order, equal to zero, as cost per unit of a service is ainimized.

However, an increase in q lowers the shadow price of the constraint,
as

it

makes

the

constraint less binding. Thus, on the margin, raising

q in response to a quota is profitable. Tariffs do not raise quality as
the cost minimization problem is unaffected by a tariff.5

There are two advantages to using a re general framework.
First, it shows that the monopolist, with two characteristics to set
so as to maximize profits, will use both to extract as much surplus

fr constmers as possible. Any restriction changes the optimal mix
'between the use of the two, and how this mix

changes

depends on demand

characteristics as shown earlier.

The second advantage of the approach is its generality. The
approach of Rodriguez (1979) and Santoni and Van Cott (1980) emerges

as a special case. Though they only consider the case of competition,
it is easy to extend omè of their results to the monopoly case, as is
done later.

The results of this section are crucial to the analysis of the next

section. In the next section, tariffs, quotas and quality controls
which lead to an equal infintesimal reduction in imports are conpared.

controls that achieve a given slight reduction of imports. A few pre—

will assume that any desired quality level can be ensured. It is

assumed that the administrative machinery can set both minimum and
rnaximum quality standards. In the same spirit, tariffs are zxt confined

to being positive. It is possible for a tariff to raise imports, and
decreases in physical imports may require subsidies.

2.2 The Sale of Licenses:
In order to be able to compare tariffs and quotas, it is necessary
to specify how

import

licenses are distributed, who

appropriates

the

rents, and what these rents are. This is easy in the case of corn—

petition,

where the difference between domestic

price

(as determined by

market supply with the quota and market demand), and the foreign price,

determines the level of rents. This difference is the price of a
license auctioned to competitive suppliers.

In the case of foreign inopo1y, no foreign supply curve exists,
with or without any restrictions present. It is not

obvious

how much

would b paid for a license, and what ensures that a license is used.
The

problem is

that

of

specifying how

the

sale of license affects the

maximization problem perceived by the monopolist. e inter-

pretation of the specification that follows is that the goverxent sets
a price for a license which is sold to foreign producers who

take

this

price as given and beyond their control. A license allows the foreign
producer to export one unit of a good of any quality it desires. Thus,

a license acts exactly like a specific tariff. If the government

This assption on the beliefs of the foreign monopolist is not
the only possible assumption that could be made. The foreign firm might

believe

that it can influence the price of a license, in this case, the

relative strengths of the monopolist and the government would determine

what part of the rents were appropriated by the monopolist. If the
monopolist refused to purchase any licenses and the government wished to
have the quota level actually Imported, the only price it could change

for a license would be zero. All rents would accrue to the foreign

firms under this assumption. There are two

reasons

why I do not

choose to make this assumption. Firstly, the relative strength of a
government as compared to a firm make the assumption implausible.

In

addition, it is often argued that in practice, tariffs generate revenues
but quotas do not as licenses are rarely sold.

I compare tariffs and

quotas when the best case for quotas is made. I show that even on these
terms, revenue effects of a tariff tend to dominate those of a quota.

The assumption that quotas generate no revenues would needlessly bias
the welfare comparisons to follow in favor of tariffs.

Once again, notice that under this assumption on the beliefs of the
monopolist, the revenue from the sale of licenses is identical to the

revenue from a specific tariff, s ,

that

lovers import. to the level

— 14

of

the restriction. If fact, all the effects of the quota may be asso—

elated with those of the specific tariff, s, that implements the quota.

2.3 Tariffs vs. iotas:
In order to compare different kinds of restrictions, it is neces—

.ary to specify the national lfare function. I will assune that the

dand side
stser

can be represented by a utility maximizing aggregate con—

who has rights

on all profits generated by competitive domestic

producers of a numeraire good. The profits generated by production of
the imported good accrue to foreign nationals. The weight given to
revenue in the welfare function may be less than one if there were considerable administrative costs of collecting the revenue, or if govern-

ment essentially wasted part of revenue raised. Similarly, if the
goverrnent cannot undertake policies in the national interest due to

revenue considerations, this weightmay exceed one. The national welfare

function, when the specific tariff "s" is levied is defined by:

W(x,q,s) — {u(x,q)

(2.1)

—

P(x,q)x]

"a" is the weight given to revenue raised in

+

the welfare function,

and is assumed to be non—negative. P(x,q) is the price paid by the
consumer for purchasing a unit of the goodof quality q •

revenue

is

sx

is the

earned by government from the scheme outlined above, where s

determined so as to cause the monopolist to sell only the desired

level of imports. Both x and q, of course, depend on s as well.
The effect on national welfare of a unit decrease in the level of
imports from the free trade levels, caused by a quota may be decomposed

— 15 —

into

three parts —

the

effect via output, the effect via quality, and

the effect via revenue. Define As as the specific tariff required to
lower imports by one unit. Then the change in ilfare due to a reduc—
tion of imports by one unit is given by:

This expression shows that there is always an adverse effect on welfare

via output of a quota. This is expected, as a monopolist produces too
little output for any given quality level, and a quota aggravates this
distortion.

Less expected is the fact that as Pq is assumed to be monotonic
in output, there is always a beneficial effect on welfare via quality

and revenue. Notice that:6

The effect on welfare via output of an import equivalent tariff and

Tariffs vs. (iotas: A Special Case:

Next consider the case where demand

is

for services of the good

produced. Higher quality is identified with greater durability, and

hence a greater quantity of embodied services. Rodriguez and Santoni
and Van Cott discuss how quotas and tariffs can be ranked in such a
m6del in the presence of conpetition.

The assumption behind this specification is that utility is a func-

tion only of the amount of services provided. Thus, if S — xq

is the

level of services, we assume

U(x,q) —

T(xq)

Thus,
P(x,q) — q r'(xq) — qG(xq)

is the inverse demand function for the good of quality q .

q gives G(xq) —

The monopolist maximizes:

Thus, q is chosen independently of S, so as to minimize
so that quality choice is independent of demand

conditions.

C(q)

Notice that

as a consequence an ad—valorem tariff does not affect the choice of q

A quota, however, does affect the choice of q

We know that the effect via quality on welfare of a quota is always

so that revenue considerations are unimportant, a quota is pre-

ferable to an import equivalent tariff. If

is large, and revenue

considerations are of primary importance, a tariff is preferable to and

import equivalent quota. If both are equally important, and demand for
services is linear, a tariff is preferable to the import equivalent

quota. Notice that this is the opposite of the Rodriguez result

where

a quota was preferable to a tariff.
This

concludes the comparison of tariffs and quotas which

are

import equivalent. We turn now to a comparison of each of these policies with import equivalent quality controls.

2.5 Quality Controls vs. Tariffs and Quotas:

Any comparison of a quality control with a tariff or a quota will
be naturally biased in favor of the tariff and quota, as these measures

generate revenue. Therefore, I will only compare them in their
effects on welfare via quality, denoted by

In their effects on welfare via quality alone, quality standards

are superior to quotas. The intuition behind this result may be

understood by refering to Diagram 1.1. If xq < o

, higher

welfare

arises from higher q and higher x , given by the shaded region in
Diagram l.la. Similarly if xq > 0 , higher welfare arises fron lwer

q and higher x , given by the shaded region in Diagram l.lb. A quota
leading to a decrease in output of a unit leads to equilibrium at a

point like A. A quality control that lowers output by as much, leads
to equilibrium at point B. The welfare at B is always higher than that
at A.

Next, I compare a tariff and the import equivalent quality control.
Again, only their effects on welfare via quality are compared. Note

—25—

that

we already have a result in the case where demand is only for ser—

vices provided. In this case, as

tariff

do not affect quality choice,

and as the effect on welfare via quality of quality controls is always

beneficial, quality controls dominate tariffs in their effects on
welfare via quality.
The comparison for the general case is made in equation (2.23

so a tariff reduces output, a quality contilol

see that the tariff shifts both x(q)

and q(x) towards the origin as in Diagram 1.2(a). A and B are achieved
by a tariff and a quality control that are import equivalent. As the
quality chosen by the monopolist is too low, and as B lies directly above
A, the quality control must dominate the tariff in its effect on welfare via
quality alone.

Siallarly, if . > 0 ,

then a subsidy would be required

to lower output, and A' would be the equilibrii under the import
equivalent tariff. A' lies directly above B and thus the tariff would

- 26

-

dominate the import equivalent quality control in terms of its effects
on welfare via quality. Similarly, if xq > 0

as in Diagram

1.2(b),

the quality control dominates the tariff as A (the tariff point) lies

directly above B (the quality control point). As xq > 0

the monopo-

list sets quality at too high a level, so that the comparison between A
and B on the basis of quality effects alone goes in favor of the quality
control.

The results of thIs subsectIon may be smarIzed as follows:

Conclusion
Although the effects of trade restrictions with endogenous quality

have been previously studied the specification of the structures to be
analyzed have been particularly suited to the paradigm of perfect coin—
pçtition.

In an imperfectly competitive world, a large number of questions
arise which do not have corresponding analogues in a competitive world.
In order to study such question, it Is important to develop simple
models to capture, possibly in Isolation, the factors which might be

important in answering such questions. This paper Is to be viewed as an
attempt at doing just this.

The purpose of

this paper

was to analyze the effects of different

kinds of trade restriction on the quality chosen by a foreign monopolist,
and to examine the relative desirability of alternative policies in

attaining a given non—economic objective. The presumption (based on the
Swan model) that quotas raise quality while ad— Valorem tariffs leave

quality unaffected was shown to be unfounded. Moreover, their effects
were shown to depend on the valuation of quality increments by marginal as
compared to all consumers —

i.e.

to demand conditions rather than to cost

conditions as in the Swan model. Away tocompare "infinitesial" equivalent
powers was developed. The use

of

this technique showed that when import

2 The effects of trade restrictions and their comparisons are all

evaluated at the free trade levels throughout the paper. In addition,
in order to be able to simplify the analysis I assume throughout that
derivative of the Inverse demand function with respect to quality is a
monotonic function of output.
3 Spence (1976).

4 As an example one might consider the following. There is a con—
tinuuin of consumers, indexed by e ,

with

reservation price u(6,q).

All consumers purchase one unit of the commodity, or none. Consumers

are distributed by f(O). u8(8,q) > 0. Demand is then given by
l_F(O*(p,q)) , where 8* Indexes the marginal consumer. P(x,q)
represents the corresponding inverse demand function. !ssy calcula-

tions show that as expected, if high 0 consumers value increments In

quality more than low 8 ones, so that U9q > 0

then xq < 0 as:
