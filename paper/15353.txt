Towards a Common European Monetary Union Risk Free Rate
Sergio Mayordomo, Juan Ignacio Peña, and Eduardo S. Schwartz
NBER Working Paper No. 15353
September 2009
JEL No. E43,E44,G15
ABSTRACT
A common European bond would yield a common European Monetary Union risk free rate. We present
tentative estimates of this common risk free for the European Monetary Union countries from 2004
to 2009 using variables motivated by a theoretical portfolio selection model. First, we analyze the
determinants of EMU sovereign yield spreads and find significant effects of the credit quality, macro,
correlation, and liquidity variables. However, their effects are different before and after the current
financial crisis, being stronger in the latter period. Robustness tests with different data frequencies,
benchmarks, liquidity variables, cross section regressions and balanced panels confirm the initial results.
We propose four different estimates of the common risk free rate and show that, in most cases, this
common rate could imply savings in borrowing costs for all the countries involved.

We present tentative estimates of a new financial variable: the common risk free rate of
interest for the European Monetary Union (EMU) members. We show how to estimate
it for a given set of countries and discuss its uses for monetary policy management and
its implication for financial markets’ integration. The results suggest that this common
rate, in most cases, could imply savings in borrowing costs for all the countries
involved.

The possibility of a common European bond has attracted the interest of the financial
press and is receiving increased attention from policy makers1. There are potential wider
benefits for the Eurozone as well as specific benefits for market agents such as issuers,
dealers, and investors. A large common bond issue could have benefits even for
countries with low credit risk (Germany, France), as it could rival American’s treasuries
market for liquidity. Moreover a single issuer would make EMU bonds more attractive
to investors in large foreign-exchange reserves (China, Japan) and enhance the euro’s
standing as a reserve currency, as well as lowering borrowing costs for all countries that
took part in it2.

This common risk free rate can be used as a benchmark for measuring the benefits from
financial market integration in the EMU. We conjecture and provide some evidence that
our estimates of this rate would be close to what a common EMU-based single bond
would yield for a specified maturity. We can then compare actual rates offered by the
different EMU countries with sovereign bonds with this common rate. This allows us to
compute the savings in terms of financing cost per year for the different EMU members.

Our results suggest that average savings in borrowing costs for all EMU countries are
positive irrespective of the common risk free rate measure employed. Of course, there
are many institutional design features that must be resolved (seniority, amount relative
to total debt issues, guarantee fund, etc.) before such a common bond can be launched.
But our paper provides a first insight into one central issue, namely, what should be the
required compensation a given country X should pay to the actual issuer (let’s assume
that the issuer is the ECB or other EMU-wide agency) to be allowed to share a given
issue of EMU-based single bonds. We argue that this compensation should be the
Credit Default Swap (CDS) spread on X’s sovereign bonds3. The benefits for country X
in using the common bond (instead of the sovereign bond) will be the enhanced rating
and liquidity the common bond would provide plus additional premiums for country
X’s macro fundamentals, and exposure to global risk

Motivated by a simple theoretical portfolio selection model, we first analyze the
determinants of EMU sovereign yield spreads and find significant effects of the credit
quality, macro, correlation, and liquidity variables. We also find that these effects are
different before and after the current financial crisis, being stronger in the latter period.
Robustness tests with different data frequencies, benchmarks, liquidity variables, cross
section regressions and balanced panels confirm the initial results.

We define the ‘Hedged Yield’ of the sovereign debt of a country as the
difference of actual yield and the corresponding CDS spread. Based on these hedged
yields we build four different estimates of the common risk free rate and show that, in

3

As a matter of fact, the CDS spread should be the upper limit for the compensation because CDS market
spreads usually include counterparty risk that should be much lower if the insurance seller is the ECB.

most cases, this common rate could imply savings in borrowing costs for all the
countries involved.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 1 reviews some
current literature on the subject; Section 2 introduces a theoretical model that allows us
to determine the main components of the sovereign bond yields. Section 3 describes the
data. Section 4 discusses the empirical results and the construction of the common risk
free rate; Section 5 discusses some policy implications. Section 6 presents some
robustness tests and Section 7 offers some concluding remarks and proposes future lines
of research.

1. Related Literature on EMU Sovereign Bond spreads
Since the formation of the European Monetary Union (EMU henceforth) the topic of the
determinants of the sovereign bonds’ yield spreads within the EMU has been the subject
of intense and increasing research. Researchers have tried to find out which are the
factors that explain the differences between sovereign yields in the EMU countries, but
so far no clear consensus has emerged. Codogno, Favero and Misale (2003) find that
for most EMU countries only international risk factors have explanatory power while
liquidity factors play a smaller role. Amira (2004) finds that sovereign yields increase
with maturity, issue size and gross fees and decrease with credit rating. Geyer,
Kossmeier and Pichler (2004) report that EMU government bond spreads are related to
common factors whereas they do not find evidence for a significant impact of
macroeconomic or liquidity related variables. Bernoth, von Hagen and Schuknecht
(2006) report that global risk factors as well as idiosyncratic macroeconomic factors
affect yield spreads, whereas liquidity plays a marginal role. Gomez-Puig (2008) finds

4

that idiosyncratic factors (credit risk and liquidity) mostly drive yield differentials but
systemic risk factors play only a marginal role. Favero, Pagano and Von Thadden
(2008) find that one aggregate risk factor is consistently priced, that liquidity
differentials are priced for a subset of countries, and that the interaction of liquidity
differentials with the risk factor is consistently priced. In all these papers the benchmark
for comparing the yield spreads is based on the German 10-year bund or German zero
coupon curves. Beber, Brandt and Kavajecz (2009), however, use as benchmark the
Euro-swap curve and show that the bulk of yield spread is explained by differences in
credit quality as measured by the CDS, whereas liquidity plays a nontrivial role
especially for low credit risk countries and in times of high market uncertainty. In
summary, most papers suggest that credit quality-related factors, common business
cycle factors (international or EMU), and, to a lower extent, liquidity-related factors are
critical drivers of sovereign yield differentials.

The selection of the appropriate benchmark reference, however, has not received
extensive attention in the literature. The most common view associates the benchmark
bond with the lowest yield. If that were all that mattered for benchmark status, then the
German market would provide, on average, the benchmark at all maturities. Analysts
who take this view accept that the appropriate criterion for benchmark status is that this
is the security against which others are priced, and they simply assume that the security
with lowest yield takes that role. A plausible alternative, however, is to interpret
benchmark to mean the most liquid security, which is therefore most capable of
providing a reference point for the market. But the Italian market, not the German, is
easily the most liquid for short-dated bonds;4 and perhaps the French is most liquid at
4

Most of the trading for 10-year German bonds occurs on the futures market; this market is then more
liquid and deeper than the cash market.

medium maturities.5 Dunne, Moore and Portes (2002) consider in detail the meaning of
the term “benchmark” bond. They investigate two possible criteria, using Grangercausality and cointegration tests. They find rather different results with the two
methods, reflecting their different temporal focus. But with neither of them do they find
the unambiguous benchmark status for German securities that would come from a
simple focus on the securities with the lowest yield at a given maturity. They suggest
looking for benchmark portfolios rather than a single benchmark security. This may be
particularly appropriate in this partially integrated market and it is the approach we take
in this paper. We take the benchmark to be a weighted average of the total gross debt at
nominal value issued by the general governments of the different EMU members.

2. Theoretical Model
The model we use to motivate the explanatory variables employed in the empirical part
of the paper is an extension of the portfolio model of bond yield differentials developed
in Bernoth et al (2006). Consider a domestic (benchmark) investor allocating a fraction
θt (θ*t ) of his real wealth wt (w*t) to a domestic D (benchmark F) security and a fraction
1-θt (1-θ*t ) to a benchmark (domestic) security. Assume that both the domestic and
benchmark securities are subject to default risk. The default process is assumed to
follow a correlated bivariate Bernoulli process (xt , x*t ), with domestic (benchmark)
default probability 1-Pt (1-Pt*). In the event of default the investor receives a fraction τt
( τt* ) of his gross domestic (benchmark) payment, τt є [0,1+r) (τt* є [0,1+r*) ) where r
(r* ) is the interest rate on the domestic (benchmark) bond. There are proportional
transaction costs lt (l*t) decreasing with domestic (benchmark) market liquidity. To
5

Favero, et al. (2008) set the French bond as the benchmark for the five-year maturity. This choice is
supported by the evidence in Dunne, Moore and Portes (2002) and by the fact that traders view the French

simplify the presentation the coefficient of risk aversion ρ is assumed to be the same for
both investors. Let St be the total supply of bond issued by the domestic government
and assuming that the market clears, market equilibrium requires that

S t = θˆt wt + θˆt* wt*

(1)

where the first term in the right hand side denotes the optimal amount of domestic
bonds held by the domestic investor and the second term denotes the optimal amount of
domestic bonds held by the benchmark investor. Assuming that the investors maximize
a one period mean-variance utility function it is possible to solve for the interest rate
differential between the two economies (details of the model can be found in Appendix
I):

Equation (3) decomposes the yield spread into four components. The first two terms are
the default risk premium which is related with individual (country-specific) default
probabilities. The higher is the domestic (benchmark) country-specific default
probability the higher (lower) is the spread. Also, the riskier the domestic bond is in
comparison with the benchmark, the greater will be the premium. Overall the effect of
increases in the default risk premium will tend to increase yield spreads6. The third term
on the right hand side is the liquidity premium. The less liquid the domestic bond is in
comparison with the benchmark’ liquidity, the greater will be this premium. The fourth
term depends on the total debt St (which we later proxy with macro factors like budget
and trade balances), the volatility of the differences in the default processes, and their
interaction. The last term in the equation is a measure of covariance risk (or global risk)
in excess of the volatility of the benchmark’s default risk.

To test this model empirically we need to specify proxies for the components in
equation (3). We use the CDS spreads as a proxy of the default risk premium as
suggested in Beber et al. (2009)7. As a measure of liquidity we use the bond’s daily
turnover volume; the difference between the domestic and benchmark economy serves
to estimate the liquidity premium8. We also include two macro measures directly
related with the total supply of bond issued by domestic government and the health of
the trade sector: total debt over GDP and net trade balance over GDP, both of them in
deviations from the benchmark. Also, we use the interaction between the total debt over

In the domestic (benchmark) cases the default risk premium decreases (increases) with an increase in the
recovery rates in case of default τt ( τt* ).

To deal with possible endogeneity problems we use the one day-lagged CDS spread
8
We realize that there is no generally held definition of liquidity. Many other measures have been
suggested in the literature. In fact there is a close relationship between many of the measures and actual
transactions costs, and the assumption that liquidity proxies measure liquidity seems to be granted, see
Goyenko, Holden and Trzcinka (2008). Moreover, volume and other liquidity measures are usually
employed in policy analysis, see European Central Bank (2009). In Section 6.4 we perform some
robustness tests with respect to different specifications of the liquidity variable.

GDP and the volatility of the differences between the domestic and benchmark yields9
as a measure of both the total supply of debt and its relative risk. Since the overall
investor’s risk attitude is not observable we proxy the global risk aversion with the
Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index VIX10. Finally, the correlation
between the domestic bond yield and the benchmark bond yield is used as a proxy for
country-specific covariance risk.

3. Data
The data consists of daily sovereign yields with maturities of 3, 5, 7, and 10 years for
eleven EMU countries from January, 1 2004 to February 27, 2009. We also split the
sample into two sub samples to take into account the effects of the ongoing financial
crisis. The first sample covers the period from January 1, 2004 to August, 8, 2007 and
the second from August 9, 2007 to February 27, 2009. Appendix II provides additional
details about the definition, sources, and timing of the data used in the study. Table 1
provides data on the total gross government debt for the EMU countries and each
country market’s share. The three largest issuers are Germany (25%), Italy (25%) and
France (21%) and the smallest are Austria (2.7%), Portugal (1.6%) and Ireland (1.1%).
Table A.1, panels 1 to 12 provides descriptive statistics by country and for the
benchmark.
In all cases the yields increase and the volatilities decrease with maturity. In general
average trading volume decreased in the second sub sample11 suggesting that
transaction costs increased across the board in the crisis period as well as CDS spreads

9

The volatility of the differences between the domestic and benchmark yields accounts for the differences
in the default processes.
10
The VIX is often used as a proxy for investor’s attitude toward risk and appears to explain movements
of the bond spreads in recent years, see Hartelius et al. (2008) and Pan and Singleton (2007).
11
There are slight increases in Belgium, Ireland and the Netherlands

9

and yield volatilities12. There is also evidence of an overall worsening of the trade
balance across countries after the crisis started13 as well as a decrease of the ratio of debt
to GDP14.

For the 3, 5, 7, and 10 year sovereign yields, and for the full sample, the lowest
averages are 3.30, 3.51, 3.70 and 3.91 respectively for Germany; the highest averages
are 3.56, 3.82, 4.02, and 4.28 for Greece. Both the standard deviations and the minimum
and maximum values indicate that there can be significant time-series variation in the
sovereign yields. For example, 3-year yield for Italy ranges from 2.29 to 5.02 during the
sample period.

Average daily trading volume (in millions of Euros) also presents wide variation
ranging from the high volumes for Germany (16,813) and Italy (11,772) to the low
volumes for Finland (239) and Ireland (130).

Average CDS rates vary substantially across countries. The lowest average in the whole
sample is 8.41 basis points for Germany; the highest average is 40.25 basis points for
Greece15. The macro factors also vary widely across countries. For instance the country
with highest average Debt/GDP ratio is Italy (104%) and the lowest Ireland (27%) and
the country with worse average trade balance is Greece (-6.5%) and the best one is

12

It is interesting to note that some countries viewed by the market as having very little average sovereign
risk (CDS spread around 2 basis points) before the crisis, like Germany, Austria, Belgium, France, or The
Netherlands, were penalized in different ways once the crisis unfolds, being Germany (16 b.p.) and
France (20 b.p.) viewed as the safest, then The Netherlands (25 b.p.) and finally Belgium (33 b.p.) and
Austria (37 b.p.). However all countries experienced, in specific days, very high CDS premium, for
instance Germany (91.8 b.p.), France (96 b.p.) or Austria (272 b.p.)
13
The only exception being Italy whose (negative) external balance does not change.
14
Portugal is the only exception with a ratio of 63% after the crisis in comparison with 61% before it.
15
Both the standard deviations and the minimum and maximum values indicate that there can also be
significant time-series variation in the sovereign CDS premium. For example, the cost of credit protection
for Ireland ranges from 2.80 to 395.80 basis points during the sample period.

10

Ireland (+5.6%). Regarding the average interaction debt factor, which measures not
only the total debt outstanding but also its risk with respect to the benchmark, varies
between 10 for Greece and 2 for Ireland, increasing markedly once the crisis starts to 16
and 4 respectively16. Finally, the average correlation between the domestic 10-year
government yield and the benchmark is highest for Germany (0.98) and lowest for
Austria (0.87) decreasing in all countries in the second sub sample, with France being
the highest (0.96) and Greece the lowest (0.76). This decrease in the correlations could
reflect a decrease in the degree of integration in the sovereign bond market of the EMU
area in time periods of financial distress17

4. Empirical Results
Having established the factors to be used as explanatory variables for the sovereign
yields spreads (as suggested by the theoretical model), we now turn our attention to
examine the economic and statistical significance of the variables in explaining both the
cross-section as well as the time series of yields spreads. We group the data by country
(11 countries) and maturity (3, 5, 7 and 10 years) totaling 44 groups which form an
unbalanced panel.18 We first fit a panel regression to the whole sample period. We then
examine whether the relative influence of these explanatory variables differs between
the relative calmer first sub period and the second sub period of heightened market
uncertainty.

16

Similar increases are also observed in all other countries.
Analyses of financial integration in the Euro Area sovereign bond market can be found in Adam et al.
(2002), Adjaouté and Danthine (2003) Baele et al. (2004) and Schulz and Wolff (2008) among others.
They conclude that despite the great convergence between yields, yield differentials have not disappeared
completely under EMU and so, European sovereign bonds are still not perfect substitutes.
18
The panel is unbalanced because we do not have information on some variables from the beginning of
the sample. However, there are no missing values once we include the first realization of the series.
17

11

Average correlations among dependent and explanatory variables are presented19 in
Table 2. As expected, sovereign yields spreads are positively related to CDSs lagged by
one day. This is consistent with our theoretical model’s prediction that increases in
default risk premiums are associated with increases in yield spreads. The negative
correlation between yield spreads and the liquidity variable is in agreement with the
theoretical prediction that the less liquid the domestic bond market is in comparison
with the benchmark’ liquidity, the greater will be the yield spread. The positive
correlations for the Debt/GDP, Interaction variable and global risk suggest that as they
each increase, sovereign yield spreads increase. The negative correlation for the Trade
balance variable suggests that trade deficit increase government yield spreads. Overall,
the signs are again in agreement with the ones suggested by the theoretical model; our
main objective, however, is to examine the joint effect of these explanatory variables on
the yield spreads.

4.1. Unbalanced Panel Regression
We regress the difference between the sovereign yield in EMU country i and the
benchmark portfolio yield onto differences in country i’s credit quality, liquidity and
macro measures from their respective cross-sectional weighted averages (or benchmark
values) and onto global risk measures. We employ a Prais-Winsten regression with
correlated panels, corrected standard errors (PCSEs) and robust to heteroskedasticity,
contemporaneous correlation across panels and serial autocorrelation within panels. The
correlation within panels is treated as a first-order autocorrelation AR(1) and the

19

All the variables, with the exception of the measure of global risk and the correlation between the
domestic Government and benchmark yields, are in deviations from the benchmark

12

coefficient of this process common20 to all the panels.21 Our panel regression model is
described by the equation:
(4)
K

M

rit − rit* = α + ∑ β k ( X k ,i ,t − X k , BNCH ,t ) + ∑ γ j D j ,t + χ Yi ,t + δ Z t + ψ C i ,t + ε i ,t
k =1

j =1

where the dependent variable is the spread between the government bond’s yield of
country i, rit at four different maturities (3,5,7,and 10 years) and the benchmark yield
r*it , at the same maturities. The benchmark yields are obtained as the weighted average
of the Government yields of the EMU countries in the sample for the corresponding
maturity (3, 5, 7, and 10 years). The weights are proportional to the portion of debt
outstanding by each country with respect to the total amount outstanding by all these
countries22. The Xk,i,t are credit risk, liquidity and macro explanatory variables (CDSt-1 ,
Volume, Total debt/GDP, Trade Balance/GDP) and XBNCH,t are their respective
weighted averages over the eleven countries,

obtained using the same procedure

employed to build the benchmark yield23. Notice that we specify the credit, liquidity
and macro variables as differences from their cross-sectional weighted averages (or
benchmark value). This approach stresses the fact that credit risk; liquidity and macro
variables are relative concepts. The Dj,t are dummy variables to take into account the
maturity effect in bond yields (3,5, and 7 years). The Yi, t is the interaction term of total
debt/GDP of country i times the volatility of the difference between domestic yield and
benchmark yield. The Zt is the global risk factor measured as the log of the VIX index
20

Better fit, as measured by the Schwarz Information Criteria, is obtained using an AR(1) autocorrelation
structure common to all panels instead of a panel-specific AR(1) autocorrelation structure.
21
Each element in the covariance matrix of the disturbances is computed with all available observations
that are common to the two panels contributing to the covariance.
22
To gain a better perspective of the dependent variable, it is worth mentioning that its maximum
(minimum) average value is equal to 21.5 (-8.9) basis points for Greece (Germany).

13

and Ci,t is the correlation between the country i yield (for its corresponding maturity)
and the benchmark’s yield.

The results of the panel regressions are reported in Table 3. Column 1 gives the results
for the whole sample period, Column 2 for the period before the financial crisis, and
Column 3 for the crisis period. The explanatory power of the regressions, reflected in
their adjusted R2 , are 20% ,12% and 25% respectively. Consistent with intuition as
well as with our theoretical model and the previous literature, the CDS lagged one
period has a strong positive impact on sovereign yield spread which indicates that a
lower credit quality increases the yield spread.

The liquidity differential is also

significant. The negative coefficient suggests that higher than average liquidity is
associated with lower yield spreads. However the impact of the liquidity is insignificant
in the first sub- sample (the period before the financial crisis). In the second sub-sample
(the period during the crisis) the effect of liquidity is significant, consistent with Beber
et al. (2009). The two macro factors (relative to GDP) and the global risk factor have
also a positive and significant impact in the sovereign yield spread. The effect of the
term measuring the interaction of total debt relative to GDP and the standard deviation
of the domestic yield minus the benchmark yield is positive and significant. Recall that
this variable measures both the total supply of debt and its relative risk against the
benchmark. Therefore the economic meaning of this variable is that, for a given debt
level, an increase in the volatility of the difference of the domestic yield and benchmark
yield increases yield spreads. The more the two rates grow apart the higher the effect on
yield spreads. This could be the case in a situation where a given country’s spreads
tends to diverge from the benchmark behavior and then the market penalizes this
23

Notice that the CDS variable is different for different maturities, whereas the other variables are the
same for all maturities.

14

divergence demanding higher yield spreads. If two countries present the same
divergence from the benchmark yield behavior, the penalization is higher for the
country with the higher level of debt relative to GDP. Finally the dummy variables
coefficients reflect the decreasing premium for longer maturities.

A comparison of Columns 2 and 3 of Table 3 suggests that the financial crisis has
penalized more heavily country’s sovereign yields with relatively high credit risk, lower
liquidity, higher indebtness, and with higher exposure to global risk.

Since there is a potential endogeneity between a country’s sovereign yields and its CDS
rates, in the panel regression results reported in Table 3 we have used a one period (day)
lag in the CDS explanatory variable. This is a standard procedure to deal with potential
endogeneity. To further address this issue, we have run and identical panel regression
but omitting the CDS explanatory variable. These results are reported in Table 4 for the
whole sample period (Column1) and for the two sub-periods (Columns 2 and 3). As can
be seen from this table the results are qualitatively very similar to those in Table 3,
confirming the significance of the other explanatory variables and suggesting that
endogeneity is not a serious issue in our case. As expected, the explanatory power of
the panel regressions is lower given that we are omitting a powerful explanatory
variable (CDS). In Section 4.2 we will further investigate this issue by running panel
regression of “hedged yields” (the difference between actual yields and the
corresponding CDS spreads) on the other explanatory variables.

Finally, we analyze the effect of the cross-sectional dispersion between countries in the
explanatory variables on the dependent variable. For this aim, we first calculate the

15

standard deviation of each dependent variable across countries at each date t. Then, we
compute the average of these standard deviations for the whole sample, the first sub
sample (period before the crisis) and the second sub sample (crisis period) and finally,
we multiply this average by the corresponding coefficient depending on the sample
period employed for its estimation (see Table 3). In Table 5 we report the results of this
sensitivity analysis of the determinants of the yield spreads. Specifically, we report the
magnitude of the change, in basis points, of the dependent variable given a change equal
to the average of the standard deviations across countries of a given explanatory
variable over all dates.24 We focus on the cross-sectional dimension of the panel and
employ the time-series dimension to calculate the average effect across time.

25

This

allows us to evaluate how the different macro or risk factors of the countries under
study affect the yield spreads.

For the whole sample the largest effect on yield spreads is caused by deviations between
the countries’ CDSs spreads (4.94 b.p.). However these effects are very different in the
two sub samples. In the first one the changes in the dependent variable are usually
small, around 1.4 b.p., whereas in the second sub sample the changes are more
substantial, around 12.2 b.p. It seems that the sensitivity of yield spreads to changes in
CDS increased noticeably once the crisis started which supports the idea of a flight to
quality in terms of Beber et al. (2009) terminology.

24

The standard deviation of the following variables: CDS spread (lagged one day); interaction of total
debt divided by GDP and the standard deviation of the difference between domestic and benchmark
yields; and the correlation between domestic Government yield and benchmark yield are calculated for
the five year’s maturity.
25
We repeat the sensitivity analysis focused on the time-series dimension of the panel. By means of this
analysis, we estimate the change in the dependent variable after a change of one standard deviation in a
given explanatory variable across time and countries. Results are in line with the ones in Table 5 but are
not reported in this paper given that our aim is to focus on how the differences between countries affect
the deviations in the yield spreads and so, we focus in the cross-section dimension.

16

The variable with the second strongest effect is the total debt issued relative to GDP. In
the whole sample the average change in the dependent variable is 3.59 b.p. and, as it
occurs with the rest of explanatory variables, its effect is very different in the two sub
samples being almost three times higher in the sample corresponding to the crisis
period. Given the economic interpretation discussed above, it seems that increased
divergence from the average behaviour is substantially (and possibly non-linearly)
penalized by the market.

A similar effect to the one found in the CDSs, but with a lower order of magnitude, is
found with respect to the liquidity variable. Before the crisis the effect is negligible but
during the crisis the effect is significant and leads to a decrease of 4.55 b.p. This
suggests the existence of a flight to liquidity during the crisis period.

The effects of the rest of variables show again fairly large differences in the two sub
samples.26 Both the interaction of total debt relative to GDP and the standard deviation
of the domestic yield minus the benchmark yield, and the correlation between the
government yield and benchmark yield increased their effect to a considerable extent in
the second sub sample in comparison with the first one.

Summarizing the results, the effect of the explanatory variables varies widely between
the sub samples, being generally stronger in the crisis period. The effect is also stronger
when the deviations from the average take place in the credit quality position (CDSs).

The Global Risk Measure (VIX Index) is not included in this sensitivity analysis as it is the same for all
the countries in the sample.

4.2 Computing Common Risk Free Rates
The results in the previous section motivate the following question. What should be the
yield of a common eurozone bond, free, at least to some extent, from the effect of the
risk factors (credit, liquidity, macro, correlation) that influence the yield of individual
sovereign bonds? The existence of a common European bond would imply the existence
of a common European interest rate27. In this section, we attempt to provide some
alternative measures for this rate and discuss the hypothetical benefits that it would
yield. A common risk free rate could produce benefits for every EMU country because
of the enhanced rating and liquidity of the common bond and from the reduction of the
effects associated with macro fundamentals and global risk.

It seems reasonable to suggest that to be allowed to profit from the reduction in
borrowing costs this common rate would provide, each EMU country interested in
participating in an issue of common bonds should compensate the bond issuer for the
specific country’s credit risk. As a starting point for this analysis we suggest that the
CDSs on its sovereign bonds is the best proxy publicly available to measure the country
risk and so, the CDS spreads represent the compensation that a given country should
pay in order to be allowed to participate in the issuance of common bonds. In what
follows we refer to the ‘Hedged Yield’ of the sovereign debt of a country as the
difference of actual yield and the corresponding CDS spread.

In what follows we propose four possible alternatives for a common risk free rate.

18

1) The first one we propose, which we call Common Risk-Free Rate 1, is the Hedged
Yield free of liquidity, correlation and macro risk effects28, computed in the
following steps:
a) We run the following Prais-Winsten regression:
(5)
K

M

rit − CDS it = α + ∑ β k X k ,i ,t + ∑ γ j D j ,t + χYi ,t + δZ i ,t + ε i ,t
k =1

i = 1,... 44

j =1

where the dependent variable is the Hedged Yield of country i (i=1,…,11) at four
different maturities (3, 5, 7 and 10 years). The Xk,i,t are liquidity and macro
explanatory variables (Volume, Total debt/GDP, Trade Balance/GDP) of country i.
The Dj,t are dummy variables to take into account the maturity effect in bond yields
(3,5, and 7 years). The Yi,t is the interaction term of total debt relative to GDP times
the volatility of the difference between domestic yield and benchmark yield. The Zi,t
is the global risk factor measured as the logarithm of VIX.
This regression is similar to the one in (4) with the exception that the dependent
variable is the hedged yield and the liquidity and macro variables are not deviations
from the benchmark.
b) We define the Common Risk Free Rate 1 (CRFR1) at time t for the
corresponding maturity according to:
CRFR1t = αˆ + γˆ j + εˆt

j = 1, 2, 3. (6)

where α̂ is the estimated constant, γˆ j is the estimate of the dummy parameter for
the maturities of 3, 5 and 7 years, respectively, and εˆt is the average cross-sectional
27

As Galati and Tsatsaronis (2001) remark, the most vivid illustration of the shortcomings of the
Government bond market is the absence of a single established reference yield curve for the new
currency.

19

residual among the eleven EMU countries at time t. α̂ gives the average common
hedged risk free rate without the effect of the other variables, γˆ j gives the term
structure effect and εˆt gives the time series variation in interest rates.

The second risk free rate we propose, which we call Common Risk-Free Rate 2, is
defined as Common Risk-Free Rate 1 but using weights in the Prais-Winsten regression
according to the debt outstanding by each EMU member relative to the total debt
outstanding. The steps are the same as in the computation of Common Risk Free Rate
129.

For purposes of comparison, we also propose two common risk free rates that do not
adjust for liquidity, correlation and macro effects. “Benchmark Hedged Yield” is the
weighted average of the individual Hedged Yields. The weights are proportional to the
portion of debt outstanding by each of the EMU countries with respect to the total
amount outstanding by all these countries. Finally, “Minimum Hedged Yield” is the
minimum Hedged Yield across the eleven EMU members. To compute this measure,
we first select the country with the minimum weekly average yield and then, using its
daily yields during the corresponding week we compute the Minimum Hedged Yield.
We would expect that, in general, the Common Risk Free Rate measures would be
lower than the Hedged Yield measures since, in addition to adjusting for the risk of
default (CDSs), they also adjust for liquidity, correlation and macro effects30.

28

The impact of these effects is estimated by means of a Prais-Winsten regression with correlated panels
corrected standard errors (PCSEs) and robust to heteroskedasticity, contemporaneous correlation across
panels and serial autocorrelation.
29
Detailed results on the computation of Common Risk Free Rates 1 and 2 are available on request.

20

The four different estimates of the common 5-year risk free rate are shown in Figure 1.
Note that the four measures are closely related but none of them is consistently below
the others. In the first part of the sample the lowest rate is the Common Risk Free rate 1
but, near the end of the sample, the lowest rate is the Minimum Hedged Yield.

5. Policy Implications: Savings in Borrowing Costs
The four measures previously defined can be used to estimate the possible savings in
borrowing costs from the issuance of common bonds in the EMU. We obtain these
savings for a given country and maturity by subtracting from the corresponding yield
the CDS spread and the four estimates of the common risk free rate. The results are
reported in Table 6, Panel A gives the results for the whole sample period, Panel B for
the period before the financial crisis, and Panel C for the crisis period. In the whole
sample, average savings in borrowing costs are usually positive irrespective of the
common risk free rate measure employed31. However savings, as expected, are
substantially higher with Common Risk Free Rates 1 and 2. The country that, on
average, gets the biggest decrease in financing costs is Greece while Ireland32 is the one
getting the smallest decrease.33 This is also the case in the period before the crisis, but in
the crisis period Finland and Greece reaps the biggest savings.34 On average, the savings
associated with the Common Risk Free 1 (Common Risk Free 2 and Min. Hedged
Yield) are around 35 (23 and 16) basis points a year for all maturities in the whole

30

Strictly speaking only Common Risk free rates 1 and 2 are truly risk free rates because they are
unrelated with the risk factors by construction.
31
As expected, in the case of the Benchmark Yield, there are very low average savings. In contrast with
the results for the other three rates, not every country will benefit from using the Benchmark Yield
32
The reason for the low decrease in financing costs for Ireland is the high CDS spread of this country
given that this spread represents the compensation that Ireland should pay in order to participate in the
issuance of common bonds.
33
For some maturities, the savings for Finland are higher than for Greece. However, we have only 202
observations for Finland in comparison with the almost 900 observations for Greece.
34
It is important to remember that the number of observations for Finland during the crisis period is 202
while for the rest of the countries this number is equal to 392.

21

sample. Countries above (below) the average are Belgium, Finland, France, Greece,
Italy and Portugal (Austria, Germany, Ireland, Spain, and Netherlands)35.

Adjaouté and Danthine (2003) argue that a unified market is Pareto superior to a
fragmented market given that yields will be lower in the former. As Adjaouté and
Danthine (2003) point out, the pricing differences between yields reflect a failure of
integration and imply costs to the euro-area Treasuries. They estimate that at the debt
levels in the euro area in 2000 the annual cost may be as high as €5 billion which could
be saved with a common bond.36 They consider that the integration could occur simply
by the establishment of a centralized agency in charge of issuing debt on behalf of the
euro area’s governments.37 However, they do not give additional details about how to
achieve this integration and how to estimate the common rates derived from the
centralized debt issuance. According to our estimations of the common risk free rate,
the average savings could be higher than in Adjaouté and Danthine (2003).

Our

estimations suggest that the average annual savings for the EMU in the period that
spans from September 2005 to February 2009 might be around €21.25 (€13.71, €8.38
and €0.07) billions if the common rate is defined as the Common Risk Free Rate 1
(Common Risk Free Rate 2, Min. Hedged Yield and Benchmark Yield).38 As Favero

35

In the first period the savings are somewhat bigger being CRFR1 (CRFR2) 39 (27) and lower for MHY
(6). In the second period average savings are lower with CRFR1 (CRFR2) 29 (17) and higher for MHY
(22) perhaps reflecting heightened systemic risk.
36
Adjaouté and Danthine (2003) estimate this amount by multiplying the outstanding debt of the Euro
area minus Germany in 2000 (2,470 billion) by the average difference of the yields with respect to
German yield which is employed as the benchmark (20 basis points).
37
Such a proposal was made in 1999 with a view of harmonizing the maturity structures, delivering a true
and single benchmark curve and helping reduce the cost that some member states have to pay to primary
dealers in order to promote their debt outside the country (Favero et al., 2000). Adjaouté and Danthine
(2003) proposal was met with considerable skepticism, because such a set-up implies some collective
responsibility for national debts, which runs contrary to the Maastricht Treaty but they also argue that the
debate on the establishment of a multilateral agency should be reopened.
38
The annual average savings are obtained by multiplying the annual average debt outstanding in the
EMU during the period 2003-2008 by the average annual profits in terms of yields for the period 20042009 (see Panel A of Table 6). The average yield value is obtained as the average of the four different
maturities.

22

and Von Thadden (2004) state, the possibility of joint bond issuance by euro-area
countries has been repeatedly considered because of its ability to exploit fully the
liquidity benefits, among others, of a unified market. They also suggest that this scheme
has been discarded because it would generate an implicit debt guarantee by some
countries in favour of others. Our tentative evidence, based on hedged yields, suggests
that a common bond market with a common yield would reap liquidity benefits for all
countries involved.

6. Robustness Tests
In this section, we report the results of several checks on the basic results. The
robustness tests consider cross-section regressions, changes in the benchmark, using
balance panel regressions and alternative liquidity measures, and employing alternative
data frequencies. In all cases the results are robust to the alternative specifications.

6.1. Cross Section Regressions
As a first robustness test we run a cross-section regression every day and then we test
for the significance of the time series of coefficients, see Fama and Macbeth (1973).
Equation (7) details our cross-section regression model:
(7)
K

M

rit − rit* = α t + ∑ β k ,t ( X k ,i ,t − X k , BNCH ,t ) + ∑ γ j ,t D j ,t + χ i ,t Yi ,t + δ i ,t Z i ,t + ε i ,t
k =1

i = 1,...44

j =1

t = 1,...,1294
where the dependent variable is the spread between the government bond’s yield of
country i (i=1,…,11)

rit at four different maturities (3,5,7,and 10 years) and the

benchmark yield r*it , at the same maturities. The benchmark yields are obtained as the
weighted average of the Government yields of the EMU countries in the sample for the

23

corresponding maturity (3, 5, 7, and 10 years). The weights are proportional to the
portion of debt outstanding by each country with respect to the total amount outstanding
by all these countries. The Xk,i,t are credit risk, liquidity and macro explanatory variables
(CDSt-1 , Volume, Total debt/GDP, Trade Balance/GDP) and Xk,BNCH,t are their
respective weighted averages over the eleven countries. Notice that we specify the
credit, liquidity and macro variables as differences from their cross-sectional weighted
averages. This approach stresses that credit risk; liquidity and macro stance are relative
concepts. The Dj,t are dummy variables to take into account the maturity effect in bond
yields (3, 5, and 7 years). The Yi,t is the interaction term of total debt relative to GDP
times the volatility of the difference between domestic yield and benchmark yield. The

Zi,t is the global risk factor .39

In order to estimate the cross-sectional effects of the above variables, we run a crosssectional regression by OLS for every date in the sample (1294 in total) and compute
the average coefficient for the whole sample and for the two subsamples. Petersen
(2009) states that the Fama-MacBeth standard errors are biased in exactly the same way
as the OLS estimates and the magnitude of the bias is a function of the serial correlation
of both the independent variable and the residual within a cluster and the number of
time periods per firm (or cluster). Thus, we must adjust the standard errors for the

39

This is measured, in this case, as the standard deviation of the difference between the domestic
Government yield and the EMU benchmark Government yield, because in equation (7), neither the VIX
index nor the variable defined from the correlation between the domestic and the benchmark yields can be
employed in the regression analysis. The reason is that the former variable is the same for all countries
while the last one causes multicollinearity problems.

24

autocorrelation of the estimated slope coefficients.40 We employ the Fama-MacBeth
methodology with Newey-West standard errors.41

The results of the cross section regressions are reported in Table 7. Column 1 gives the
results for the whole sample period, Column 2 for the period before the financial crisis,
and Column 3 for the crisis period. The average R2 of the cross-sectional regressions are
73%, 69% and 83% respectively42. The magnitude of the regression coefficient suggests
that a one standard deviation increase in the CDS above the weighted average is
associated with an average increase in the sovereign yield spread of 6.4, 3.4 and 13
basis points respectively. These are the most significant economic effects found for the
explanatory variables. The two macro factors (relative to GDP) have a significant
impact in the sovereign yield spread. One standard deviation increase in the total debt
and the net trade balance, both above the weighted average, is associated with an
average increase in the sovereign yield spread of 2.2, 0.7 and 5.8 basis points and a
decrease of 1, 0.5 and 0.9 basis points respectively.

The effect of the term measuring the interaction of total debt and the standard deviation
of the domestic yield minus the benchmark yield is positive and significant. One
standard deviation increase in this variable is associated with an average increase in the
sovereign yield spread of 1.6, 0.8 and 3.5 basis points respectively.

40

As Petersen (2009) states, when there is only a time effect, the correlation of the estimated slope
coefficients across years is zero and the standard errors estimated by the Fama-MacBeth are unbiased.
41
In order to find an unbiased t-statistic, we regress the estimated coefficients on a constant using the
Newey-West adjustment to control for serial correlation. This methodology is also employed in
Davydenko and Strebulaev (2007).
42
To gain a better understanding of the effects of the explanatory variables on the dependent variable, it
is worth noting that the maximum (minimum) average value by country for the deviation between the
Government yield and the benchmark yield is equal to 21.5 (-8.9) basis points for Greece (Germany).

25

The relative riskiness of a given country as measured by the volatility of the difference
between the domestic Government yield and the EMU benchmark is not significant in
any of the three samples. With respect to the liquidity differential variable the negative
coefficient suggests that higher than weighted average liquidity is associated with lower
yield spreads. The economic impact of the liquidity differential is the lowest of all the
explanatory variables in the analysis for the whole sample and almost the lowest for the
first subsample. However, in the analysis for the crisis period the impact of the liquidity
differential increases considerably and is the third most important after CDSt-1 and Total
debt/GDP. One standard deviation increase in liquidity above the average in the crisis
period is associated with an average change in the sovereign yield spread of -4.9 basis
points. Finally the dummy variables coefficients reflect the decreasing premium for
longer maturities.

Overall the results of the cross sectional regressions are consistent with the ones given
by the unbalanced panel regression reported in Section 4.1 indicating that the main
results of the analysis are robust to different specifications of the regressions. The
sensitivity analysis’ results for the cross-sectional regression are also similar to those
reported in Table 5 for the panel regressions.

6.2 Changing the Benchmark
We next address the issue of how robust are our results to the choice of benchmark. In
particular, as is common in the literature, we use the German bond as a benchmark.
Table 8 presents the results of estimating the panel regression equation (4) using two
different benchmarks. Besides the benchmark used in this study, which is obtained from
the relative weights calculated from the total debt outstanding by each country over the

26

total amount in the EMU, we present the results obtained using the German bond as the
benchmark. As can be seen from the Table, our main results are not very sensitive to the
choice of benchmark.

6.3 Balanced Panel
To be able to use as much of the data as possible and deal with missing observations the
panel regressions estimated in this paper have been unbalanced. In this section we look
at the robustness of our results to the use of a balanced panel.

Table 9 presents the results of fitting equation (4) to a balanced panel data formed by
ten of the eleven countries and ranging from March 2006 to February 2009.43 The
estimation is done by means of Generalized Least Squares (GLS). The GLS procedure
allows estimation in the presence of AR(1) autocorrelation within panels and crosssectional correlation and heteroskedasticity across panels. Even though the data used in
this regression is somewhat different, the results obtained are similar to those obtained
for the unbalanced panel. In fact, the magnitude and significance of the explanatory
variables provides stronger support for the specification used.

6.4 Liquidity measures
We also analyze the robustness of our results to alternative specifications of the
liquidity measure. Table 10 presents the results of fitting model (4) to the full sample
using three alternative liquidity measures: total daily turnover volume, bid-ask spreads

43

We exclude Finland and the observations before the 27th of March, 2006 in order to have a balanced
panel. The reason is that for some countries, the CDSs series present missing values before that date. In
the case of Finland there are only 202 observations on CDSs.

27

and average daily turnover volume.44 In all cases the liquidity coefficients have the
expected signs and are significant and the results for the other variables do not change
materially.

6.5 Data frequency
Some macro series (Gross Debt outstanding) have annual frequency; other series (GDP)
have quarterly frequency while others (Net Trade Balance) have monthly frequency. In
fact these are the data frequencies employed in Curto et al. (2008) or Codogno et al.
(2003) among others. As an additional robustness test we analyze the regression in
equation (4) using data with a monthly and quarterly frequency. In both cases the
number of observations decreases substantially with respect to the case where we use
daily frequency. However, results are in line with the ones obtained using a daily data
and are available on request. Overall the above outcomes suggest that our main findings
are not sensitive to the data’s time frequency45.

7. Summary and Conclusions
In this paper we study the determinants of EMU sovereign bonds yields and then
present estimations of the hypothetical risk free rate a common bond would yield. To
model the determinants of yield spreads we first propose a theoretical portfolio selection
model to motivate the variable selection. Then for the period 2004 to 2009 we fit an
unbalanced panel model, using as a benchmark a weighted average of the total gross
debt issued by the governments of the different EMU members. We find that credit
44

This average volume is calculated as the ratio between the total daily turnover volume and the number
of bonds issued by the corresponding country.
45
Gomez-Puig (2007) transforms the macro variables employed in her analysis into variables with a daily
frequency. For this transformation, she extrapolates the corresponding variable assuming a daily constant
rate of increase. We find that the results obtained after extrapolating the macro variables, assuming a
constant rate of increase between two different values of the corresponding variable, are equivalent to the
ones obtained in Table 3.

28

quality, macro, correlation, and liquidity variables have a significant effects on EMU
sovereign yield spreads. However, their effects are different before and after the current
financial crisis, being stronger in the latter period. Robustness tests with different data
frequency, benchmarks, liquidity variables, cross section regressions and balanced panel
confirm the initial results.

Motivated by the these results we try to answer the following question: What should be
the yield of a common eurozone bond, free, at least to some extent, from the effect of
the risk factors (credit, liquidity, macro, correlation) that influence the yield of
individual sovereign bonds? We present four different estimations of this hypothetical
common risk free rate and show that, in most cases, average savings in borrowing costs
for all EMU countries are positive irrespective of the common risk free rate measure
employed.

We realize that there are many complex institutional design features that must be
resolved before an actual common bond issue for the eurozone could be a reality, but
our paper provides a first insight into one central issue. Namely, what should be the
required compensation a given country should pay to the formal issuer to be allowed to
share a given issue of EMU-based single bonds. We argue that this compensation
should be the CDS spread on a given country sovereign bonds. The benefits for a given
country in using the common bond (instead of the sovereign) will be the enhanced
rating and liquidity the common bond would provide plus additional premiums for
country macro fundamentals, and exposure to global risk.

29

Our results may be interpreted as tentative evidence in favour of the hypothesis that a
common bond and a common risk free rate in the EMU could produce substantial
savings in borrowing costs for all the countries involved. Looking forward, we expect
more conclusive evidence on other common risk free rate measures as well as in other
market segments. The procedures of this paper can also be applied to other sovereign
bonds and common currency areas.

Appendix I
We consider a domestic (benchmark) investor allocating a fraction θt (θ*t ) of his real
wealth wt (w*t) to a domestic D (benchmark, F) security and a fraction 1-θt (1-θ*t ) to a
benchmark (domestic) security. We assume that both the domestic and benchmark
securities are subject to default risk. The default process is assumed to follow a
correlated bivariate Bernoulli process (xt , x*t ), with domestic (benchmark) default
probability 1-Pt (1-Pt*). In the event of default the investor receives a fraction τt ( τt* )
of his gross domestic (benchmark) payment, τt є [0,1+r) (τt* є [0,1+r*) ) where r (r* ) is
the interest rate on the domestic (benchmark) bond. There are proportional transaction
costs lt (l*t) decreasing with domestic (benchmark) market liquidity. The coefficient of
risk aversion ρ is the same for both investors. The utility function of both the domestic
and foreign investors depends positively on the expected real wealth, E t [wt +1 ] and
negatively on its variance Vart [wt +1 ] . The domestic investor maximizes the following
mean-variance utility function:

Appendix II
This appendix provides additional details about the definition, sources, and timing of the data used in the
study.46
1. Sovereign Yields Spreads. 3, 5, 7 and 10 years daily sovereign yields are obtained from Datastream.
The dependent variable in equation (4) is defined as the difference between the domestic sovereign yield
and the benchmark yield. The benchmark yield is defined as the weighted average of the EMU
Government yields. The weights are proportional to the portion of debt outstanding by each of the EMU
countries with respect to the total amount outstanding in the EMU. The general governments gross debt
data employed to form the weights are reported in Table 1 and are obtained from the AMECO database.
2. Liquidity (total bond daily turnover volume). Liquidity is proxied by the total daily turnover volume
reported in Datastream. The total turnover volume is obtained as the sum of the turnover volumes of all
the sovereign bonds issued by a given country. This volume is reported in terms of monthly information
on the average daily turnover volume per bond during a given month by Datastream. The turnover
volume for the total number of bonds issued by a given Government derives from trades entered into
TRAX. In equation (4), we employ the deviation of the logarithm of the domestic total bond daily
turnover volume, in million of Euros, from the log of the benchmark total bond daily turnover volume, in
million of Euros.
3. CDS. The daily CDS spreads in the study are obtained from the Datastream system. These CDS
spreads are midmarket indicative prices for three, five, seven and ten year CDS contracts. In all cases, the
CDS contract references the sovereign (as opposed to a central bank or some other entity). For all
countries CDSs are Euro-denominated. CDSs quotes are given in basis points. In equation (4) the
explanatory variable referent to CDSs is obtained as the difference between the domestic and benchmark
(weighted average) CDS spreads lagged one day, in percentages.
4. Debt/GDP. This variable is the ratio between the general Government gross debt at nominal value and
the GDP, obtained from Ecowin. As the frequency of the gross debt is annual, the frequency of this ratio
is also annual. In equation (4), we employ the difference between the domestic and benchmark Debt/GDP
ratios as explanatory variable.
5. Interact.(Debt). This variable is an interaction term representing the product of Debt/GDP and the
monthly standard deviation of the domestic yield minus the benchmark yield. This variable has monthly
frequency.
6. Trade Balance/GDP. This variable is the ratio between the net trade balances at the end of every
month divided by the GDP. The net trade balance data as well as GDP data are obtained from Ecowin.
The frequency of this ratio is monthly. The explanatory variable of equation (4) is obtained as the
deviation of the domestic Trade Balance/GDP ratio from the benchmark equivalent ratio.
7. VIX (Global risk). This variable represents the overall global risk and it is proxied by the Chicago
Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) (it is a measure of the implied volatility of S&P 500
index options). VIX is obtained from the Reuters system. We take the logarithm of VIX when we employ
it as an explanatory variable. VIX has daily frequency.
8. Corr (domestic, benchmark). This variable is the monthly correlation between the domestic
Government bond yield and the EMU benchmark bond yield. This correlation is reported for the 3, 5, 7
and 10 years maturities. The frequency of this variable is monthly.
9. Yield – CDS. This variable is the difference between the Government yield minus the CDS spread for
the same maturity (3, 5, 7 and 10 years). The deviation of this variable from the benchmark equivalent
measure is employed as dependent variable in equation (5). This variable has daily frequency.

46

For yearly, quarterly and monthly data we use end of previous year (quarter or month) data. For instance, in the
case of the Debt/GDP variable which has yearly frequency, we use the value at the end of 2004 for the whole year
2005. Thus, we are assuming that investors at any time in 2005 know the value of Debt/GDP variable at the end of
2004 but do not know its 2005 end-of-year value.

35

Table A.1: Summary Statistics by country
This table reports the summary statistics of the variables employed in the paper for eleven EMU countries and for the benchmark.
Yield 3y, Yield 5y, Yield 7y and Yield 10y refer to the Government bond yield for a constant maturity of 3, 5, 7 and 10 years, respectively, and they are reported in percentage. Liquidity refers to the total bond daily turnover volume which is measured in millions
of Euros. CDS(-1) is the Credit Default Swap spread (in basis points) lagged one day. Debt/GDP represents the total gross debt
outstanding at the end of the year divided by the GDP at that moment and it is measured in percentage. Interact (Debt) is the product of Debt/GDP and the standard deviation of the domestic yield minus the benchmark yield. Trade Balance/GDP refers to the
net trade balance at the end of every month divided by the GDP at that moment and it is reported in percentage. Global Risk is a
measure of the overall risk which is obtained from the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) and it is a measure
of the implied volatility of S&P 500 index options. Corr(domestic, benchmark) represents the monthly correlation between the domestic Government bond yield and the EMU benchmark bond yield. This correlation is obtained for the 3, 5, 7 and 10 years maturities although we only report the correlation corresponding to a maturity of 10 years. (Yield - CDS3y), (Yield - CDS5y), (Yield CDS7y), (Yield - CDS10y) are the difference, reported in percentage, between the Government yield and the CDS spread, both
of them with the same constant maturity equal to 3, 5, 7 and 10 years, respectively. For the CDS(-1), (Yield - CDS3y), (Yield CDS5y), (Yield - CDS7y) and (Yield - CDS10y), we report the summary statistics after the 5th of September 2005. The reason is
that for some countries these variables present missing values before the previous date. This homogenization of the sample allows
us to compare these variables between different countries and also the benchmark.

Table 2: Correlation between explanatory variables
This table reports the correlation between the dependent and explanatory variables employed in equations (4), (5) and (7). Gov. Yield refers to the difference between the domestic
Government yield and the benchmark yield. CDS(-1) refers to the difference between the domestic and benchmark CDS spreads (in percentage) lagged one day. Liquidity
represents the deviation of the logarithm of the domestic total bond daily turnover volume, in millions of Euros, from the log of the benchmark total bond daily turnover volume
Debt/GDP refers to the difference between the domestic and benchmark total gross debt outstanding at the end of the year divided by the corresponding GDP at that moment.
GDP at that moment. Inter. (Debt) is an interaction term that represents the product of Debt/GDP and the standard deviation of the domestic yield minus the benchmark yield.
Trade Balance/GDP refers to the deviation of the domestic net trade balance at the end of every month divided by the GDP from the benchmark equivalent measure. Global Risk
is a measure of the overall risk which is obtained from the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) and it is a measure of the implied volatility of S&P 500 index options.
Corr( dom. & bnchmk y.) is the monthly correlation between the domestic Government bond yield and the EMU benchmark bond yield. Yield - CDS refers to the deviation of the
domestic Government yield minus the CDS spread for the same maturity from the benchmark equivalent measure. Gov. Yield is employed as dependent variable in equations
(4) and (7) while Yield - CDS is the dependent variable in equation (5). Panel 1 reports the correlations for the whole sample while Panel 2 and 3 report the correlations before
09/08/2007 and after this date, respectively.

Table 3: Determinants of the deviations between the Government Yield and the Benchmark Yield
This table reports the results of the unbalanced panel regressions. The dependent variable is the deviations between
the Government yields and the Benchmark yields which are obtained as the weighted average of the Governments
yields of the different European Monetary Union countries in the sample. The weights are proportional to the portion
of debt outstanding by each of the EMU countries with respect to the total amount outstanding by all these countries.
Our database is formed by eleven EMU countries and spans from January 2004 to February 2009. All the variables
(dependent and explanatory) except the measure of global risk and the measure of correlation between the domestic
Government and benchmark yields are presented in deviations from the value of the same variable for the benchmark.
We group the panels by country and maturity (3, 5, 7 and 10 years) such that we have, at most, 44 groups which
form an overall unbalanced panel. We estimate the coefficients of the determinants of deviations between yields by
means of a Prais-Winsten regression with correlated panels corrected standard errors (PCSEs) and robust to heteroskedasticity, contemporaneous correlation across panels and serial autocorrelation within panels. The correlation
within panels is treated as a first-order autocorrelation AR(1) and the coefficient of this process common to all the
panels. Each element in the covariance matrix of the disturbances is computed with all available observations that
are common to the two panels contributing to the covariance. Column (1) reports the results for the whole sample,
Column (2) reports the results for the period before the crisis (January 2004 - August 2007) and Column (3) includes
the results for the crisis period (August 2007 - February 2009). The results presented correspond to the estimated
coefficient and the t-statistic (between brackets).

from the benchmark which is now excluded. All the variables (dependent and explanatory) except the measure of

Table 5: Sensitivity Analysis of the Determinants of the deviations between
the Government Yield and the Benchmark Yield
This table provides the sensitivity analysis of the determinants of the deviations between the Government yields and the Benchmark yields. All the variables (dependent and explanatory) except the
correlation between the domestic and benchmark yields are presented in deviations from the value of
the variable for the benchmark. Column (1) reports the results for the whole sample, Column (2) reports
the results for the period before the crisis (January 2004 - August 2007) and Column (3) includes the
results for the crisis period (August 2007 - February 2009). Each column reports the response, in
basis points, of the dependent variable (deviation of the domestic Government yield from the benchmark yield) to a change equal to the average of the standard deviations of a given explanatory variable
across countries over all dates. For this aim, we first calculate the standard deviation of each dependent variable across countries at each date t. Then, we compute the average of these standard deviations for the whole sample, the first subsample (period before de crisis) and the second subsample
(crisis period) and finally we multiply this average by the corresponding coefficient depending on
the sample period employed for its estimation (see Table 3). The standard deviation of variables: CDS
spread (lagged one period); interaction of total debt divided by GDP and yield S.D.; and correlation
between Gov. yield and benchmark yield are presented for a maturity of five years.

Table 6: Savings in borrowing costs derived from a single EMU bond for different maturities
This table reports the estimated average benefits by country and the overall EMU average benefits, in basis points, for the maturities of 3, 5, 7 and 10 years derived from the existence of a single EMU bond
market. In Panel A, we report the average benefits for the period that spans from September 7th, 2005 to February 27th, 2009. The beginning of the sample is set in September 2005 in order to facilitate
comparisons between countries due to the lack of CDSs data for some maturities before that date. CDSs are necessary to obtain the hedged yield which enables us to estimate the savings in borrowing costs.
In Panel B, we report the potential average benefits for the period before the subprime crisis (September 2005 - August 2007) and Panel C includes average benefits during the crisis period (August 2007 February 2009). We report the potential benefits obtained under different versions of the Common risk-free rate. Common Risk-Free Rate 1 denotes the rate estimated by excluding the effect of country
specific and global risk factors, the liquidity factor and macro factors from the hedged yield. The effect of the previous factors is estimated by means of a iso regression with correlated panels
corrected standard errors (PCSEs) and robust to heteroskedasticity, contemporaneous correlation across panels and serial autocorrelation (AR(1)) within panels. The dependent variable in the previous
regression is the hedged yield, and the explanatory variables are the same as those in Table 4 but in absolute terms instead of deviations from the benchmark. The Common Risk-Free Rate 2 is equivalent to the
previous rate and it is obtained after excluding the same factors from the hedged yield but the effect of this factors is now estimated with a weighted Prais-Winsten regression similar to the previous one but
with the weights defined from the ratio between the debt outstanding by a given country and the total debt outstanding by the 11 EMU countries. Min. Hedged Yield denotes the minimum hedged yield day
among all the daily hedged yields of the 11 EMU countries for the maturities of 3, 5, 7 and 10 years. Benchmark Yield refers to the hedged yield of the benchmark which is obtained as the weighted average of
the Governments yields of the different EMU countries in the sample. The weights are proportional to the portion of debt outstanding by each of the EMU countries with respect to the total amount
outstanding by all these countries. Finally, in the last column we show the average profits (in basis points) in terms of yields for the overall EMU derived from the existence of a single EMU bond for the
different maturities.

Table 7: Determinants of the deviations between the Government Yield and the Benchmark Yield (Cross Section Analysis)
This table reports the results of the cross-sectional regrassions. All the variables (dependent and explanatory) are presented in deviations from
the value of the variable for the benchmark. We run a cross-sectional regression by OLS for every date (1294) in the sample and calculate the
average coefficient for the 1294 regressions which is reported in the first column. We find that the estimated slope coefficients present autocorrelation and for this reason, in the second column we report the t-statistic obtained from the Newey-West adjusted standard errors. These errors
are obtained after regressing with Newey-West standard errors adjustment the loadings on each factor, which are shown in the first column, on
a constant. Intercept that was included at the first stage is not reported. The third column reports the portion of cross-sectional regressions
where the sign of the coefficient is the same as the expected sign. The fourth column shows the change in the dependent variable after a change
in the explanatory variable equal to the standard deviation of this variable. Last column reports the portion of variance in the dependent variable
explained by the corresponding explanatory variable. This portion is calculated after multiplying the coefficient by the ratio of the standard deviations of the independent variable and the dependent variable. Panel A reports the results for the whole sample, Panel B reports the results for
the period before the crisis (January 2004 - August 2007) and Panel C includes the results for the crisis period (August 2007 - February 2009).

Table 8: Determinants of the deviations between the Government Yield and
the Benchmark Yield for different benchmarks
This table reports the results of the unbalanced panel regressions using an alternative benchmark: the German bond
yield. All the variables (dependent and explanatory) except the measure of global risk and the measure of correlation
between the domestic Government and benchmark yields are presented in deviations from the value of the variable
for the benchmark. We group the panels by country and maturity (3, 5, 7 and 10 years) such that we have, at most,
44 groups which form an overall unbalanced panel. We estimate the coefficients of the determinants of deviations
between yields by means of a Prais-Winsten regression with correlated panels corrected standard errors (PCSEs)
and robust to heteroskedasticity, contemporaneous correlation across panels and serial autocorrelation within panels. The correlation within panels is treated as a first-order autocorrelation AR(1) and the coefficient of this process
common to all the panels. Each element in the covariance matrix of the disturbances is computed with all available
observations that are common to the two panels contributing to the covariance. Column (1) reports the results for the
benchmark employed in Table 3 and it is equivalent to the first column of that table. The results in Column (2) are
obtained by using the values of Germany as the benchmark. The results presented correspond to the estimated
coefficient and the t-statistic (between brackets).

Table 9: Determinants of the deviations between the Government Yield
and the Benchmark Yield using a balanced panel
This table reports the results of the balanced panel regressions. The data includes only ten of the eleven EMU countries and spans the period from March 2006 to February 2009. In order to have a balanced panel Finland and the
observations before the 27th of March are excluded. All the variables (dependent and explanatory) except the measure of global risk and the measure of correlation between the domestic Government and benchmark yields are presented in deviations from the value of the variable for the benchmark. We group the panels by country and maturity
(3, 5, 7, and 10 years) such that we have, at most 40 groups which form a balanced panel. The estimation is done
using Generalized Least Squares. The GLS procedure that we employ allows estimation in the presence of AR(1)
autocorrelation within panels and cross-sectional correlation and heteroskedasticity across panels. Column (1) reports the results for the whole sample, Column (2) reports the results for the period before the crisis (March 2006 August 2007) and Column (3) includes the results for the crisis period (August 2007 - February 2009). The results
presented correspond to the estimated coefficient and the t-statistic which is reported between brackets.

Table 10: Determinants of the deviations between the Government Yield
and the Benchmark Yield using different liquidity measures
This table reports the results of the unbalanced panel regression using altermative liquidity measures. Column (1)
reports the results for the whole sample using as liquidity proxy the total daily turnover volume, Column (2) reports
the results obtained after using the bid-ask spread as the liquidity measure and Column (3) shows the results
obtained if we employ as a proxy for liquidity the average daily turnover volume. This average volume is calculated
as the ratio between the total daily turnover volume and the number of bonds issued by the corresponding country.
The results presented correspond to the estimated coefficient and the t-statistic (between brackets). We estimate
the coefficients of the determinants of deviations between yields by means of a Prais-Winsten regression with correlated panels corrected standard errors (PCSEs) and robust to heteroskedasticity, contemporaneous correlation
across panels and serial autocorrelation within panels. The correlation within panels is treated as a first-order autocorrelation AR(1) and the coefficient of this process common to all the panels. Each element in the covariance matrix of the disturbances is computed with all available observations that are common to the two panels contributing

The figure shows the four proposed alternatives for a 5-year common risk free rate in the EMU area. These alternatives according to the order of the legend are (i) Benchmark Hedged Yield obtained as a weighted average
of the hedged yield, which is defined as the difference between the sovereign yield and the corresponding CDS,
whose weights are proportional to the debt outstanding by each of the EMU countries with respect to the total
amount outstanding by all these countries. (ii) Min. Hedged Yield obtained as the minimum hedged yield among
the eleven EMU members. First, we find the country with the minimum average weekly hedged yield and we
employ the daily hedged yields of that country during the corresponding week, when its hedged yield is the
minimum, to form the Min. Hedged Yield. (iii) Common Risk-Free Rate 2 defined as the hedged yield exempt
of liquidity, risk and macro effects such that the influence of these effects is estimated by means of a PraisWinsten regression with correlated panels corrected standard errors (PCSEs) and robust to heteroskedasticity,
contemporaneous correlation across panels and serial autocorrelation and using weights proportional to the debt
outstanding by each EMU member. (iv) Common Risk-Free Rate 1 obtained as Common Risk-Free Rate 2 but
without using weights.
