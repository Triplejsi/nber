Where Does Energy R&D Come From? Examining Crowding Out from Environmentally-Friendly
R&D

ABSTRACT
Recent efforts to endogenize technological change in climate policy models demonstrate the importance
of accounting for the opportunity cost of climate R&D investments. Because the social returns to
R&D investments are typically higher than the social returns to other types of investment, any new
climate mitigation R&D that comes at the expense of other R&D investment may dampen the overall
gains from induced technological change. Unfortunately, there has been little empirical work to guide
modelers as to the potential magnitude of such crowding out effects. This paper considers both the
private and social opportunity costs of climate R&D. Addressing private costs, we ask whether an
increase in climate R&D represents new R&D spending, or whether some (or all) of the additional
climate R&D comes at the expense of other R&D. Addressing social costs, we use patent citations
to compare the social value of alternative energy research to other types of R&D that may be crowded
out. Beginning at the industry level, we find some evidence of crowding out in sectors active in energy
R&D, but not in sectors that do not perform energy R&D. This suggests that funds for energy R&D
do not come from other sectors, but may come from a redistribution of research funds in sectors that
are likely to perform energy R&D. Given this, we proceed with a detailed look at climate R&D in
two sectors – alternative energy and automotive manufacturing. Linking patent data and financial
data by firm, we ask whether an increase in alternative energy patents leads to a decrease in other types
of patenting activity. We find crowding out for alternative energy firms, but no evidence of crowding
out for automotive firms. Finally, we use patent citation data to compare the social value of alternative
energy patents to other patents by these firms. Alternative energy patents are cited more frequently,
and by a wider range of other technologies, than other patents by these firms, suggesting that their
social value is higher.

Throughout the world, proposals to reduce carbon emissions include increased research
and development (R&D) funding (de Coninck et al 2008; Newell 2007). Both a 1997 report
from the President’s Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) and a 2004
report from the bipartisan National Commission on Energy Policy recommended doubling U.S.
government energy R&D spending. Others advocate increases by a factor of five or ten, likening
the need for new energy technologies to the Manhattan Project’s efforts to create a nuclear
weapon (Kammen & Nemet, 2005). Such proposals raise two concerns. First, R&D subsidies
will likely have little effect unless accompanied by policies requiring significant emissions
reductions. Second, dramatic increases in energy R&D may come at a high cost, as these
research efforts may draw away research funding and scientists from other productive sectors
(Popp, 2006a, Yang & Oppenheimer, 2007, Schneider & Goulder, 1997). This paper focuses on
the second of these concerns, by asking whether new energy R&D efforts crowd out other types
of R&D spending.
Recent efforts to endogenize technological change in Integrated Assessment (IA) models
of climate policy highlight the need to properly account for the opportunity cost of
environmental R&D investments. Because the social returns to R&D investments are typically
higher than the social returns to other types of investment, any new environmental R&D that
comes at the expense of other R&D investment will dampen the cost-savings potential of
induced technological change. Popp (2004) shows that assumptions about the magnitude of such
crowding out explain much of the variation in results across IA models with induced
technological change. For example, among models that use R&D expenditures as the means by
which technology improves, Nordhaus (2002) assumes a fixed supply of R&D labor, so that new
energy R&D completely crowds out other R&D. As a result, he finds induced technological

2
change has little effect on welfare or climate policy. In contrast, Buonanno et al. (2003) model
energy R&D and other R&D as complements, so that crowding out does not occur. Their model
finds a stronger effect for policy-induced R&D than other models.
Note that the question of crowding out is even more important for IA models than it is for
energy R&D policy. In many IA models, such as those cited above, overall technological change
is treated as exogenous. While crowding out may be observed in the data, so that other R&D
falls when energy R&D increases, this may simply be a result of rational, profit maximizing
firms switching R&D resources from opportunities that become less profitable as energy prices
increase (e.g. designing larger, gas-guzzling vehicles) to opportunities that are more profitable
(e.g. designing hybrid vehicles). In such a case, one might not be concerned about crowding out
from the perspective of a policy maker increasing spending on energy R&D – in fact, such
crowding out may be a desired policy effect. However, in terms of these models, whether or not
it is profitable to reduce R&D on other projects is irrelevant. Since energy R&D is endogenous
in these models, but other R&D is not, R&D resources switched from non-energy to energy
projects will be double-counted unless the reduction in non-energy R&D is accounted for by
reducing the level of autonomous technological change when more energy R&D is induced. That
is, exogenous levels of autonomous technological change in these models should only include
the effects of non-energy R&D. If energy R&D replaces other forms of R&D, the effects of
autonomous technological change must fall.
Unfortunately, there has been little empirical work addressing the potential magnitude of
such crowding out effects. Related work includes Link (1982), who finds evidence that part of
the measured decline in productivity R&D in the 1970s occurred because more R&D was
directed towards environmental research, whose benefits (e.g. a cleaner environment) were not

3
measured in traditional market outcomes. Using macroeconomic data, Nemet and Kamen (2007)
find little evidence of crowding out from federal energy R&D spending. However, in a survey of
Austrian firms, Roediger-Schluga (2003) finds most firms cancelled or postponed other R&D
projects in order to increase environmental R&D after passage of new volatile organic compound
standards.1 This paper addresses the crowding out issue directly, focusing on both the private
and social opportunity costs of climate R&D. Here, the key question is whether increases in
energy R&D are likely to represent new R&D spending, or whether some (or all) of the
additional climate R&D comes at the expense of, or crowds out, other R&D. To address the
social opportunity costs of climate R&D, we ask whether the social value of energy R&D differs
from other types of innovation. The paper also contributes to the literature on energy R&D by
providing a detailed description of who performs this R&D.
We explore the question of private R&D opportunity costs at several levels. First, we
examine the effect of economy-wide increases in energy R&D on total R&D spending at the
industry level in order to investigate whether investment dollars flowing to energy-related
research are coming at the expense of overall R&D in specific sectors. While this first question
addresses flows across sectors, it does not tell us whether and how research activity changes
within individual firms as energy R&D activities increase. To address this second question, we
use patent data to examine changes in the research portfolios of companies actively performing
energy R&D. New climate R&D undertaken by firms will crowd out other R&D if firms are
financially constrained. Several papers have examined factors determining firm-level R&D
financing and conclude that financial constraints are often present. These results vary by country
(e.g., financial constraints appear more binding in the U.S. and U.K. than in France and
1

In a related vein, several authors have asked whether increases in defense R&D spending crowds out other R&D.
Examples include Morales-Ramos (2002), Buck et al. (1993), and Mueller and Atesoglu (1993).

Germany) and by firm size (financial constraints are more binding for smaller firms).2
Moreover, Lach & Schankerman (1988) show that firms tend to smooth R&D investment over
time, suggesting that there are large adjustment costs to changing the level of R&D within a firm.
However, such studies have typically used aggregate industry or firm-level R&D data. Thus,
they are unable to distinguish between types of R&D performed. In this paper, we combine
firm-level financial data taken from the Compustat database of publicly traded firms, with patent
records for the same firms. We use patent classifications to separately identify the results of
energy research projects from other research. Using these data, we can investigate whether
increases in energy patents crowd out other patenting activity at the firm level.
As we find some evidence of crowding out within sectors, we conclude by considering
the social value of research by energy firms. Using patent citation data as a measure of the social
value of innovations, we ask whether energy patents are more valuable than other innovations.
While we do find evidence that energy R&D patents are more valuable, they do not appear to be
more valuable than the patents most likely to be crowded out by an increase in energy R&D.

I. Crowding Out Across Sectors
We begin by looking at the effect of energy R&D spending on overall R&D activity at
the sectoral level. Here, we are interested in whether R&D flows across sectors when energy
R&D levels change, so that there is a net draw on R&D away from specific sectors. For this, we
use R&D data from the National Science Foundation Survey of Industrial Research and
Development. Defining IRDi,t as company-financed R&D performed in industry i at time t, ERDt

2

Recent papers on R&D financing constraints include Hall et al. (1999), who find stronger financial constraints in
the U.S. than in Japan and France; Harhoff (1998), who finds weaker constraints in Germany, with smaller firms
most affected; and Bougheas, Görg, & Strobl (2003), who find evidence of financial constraints in Irish firms. Hall
(2002) provides a review of this literature on firm-level financing of R&D.

5
as the level of total company-financed energy R&D spending in year t, FEDRDt as federallyfunded R&D performed by industry,3 and Yi,t as value added in industry i at time t, we propose
the following relationship:
(1)

IRDi,t = f(IRDi,t-1, Yi,t-1, FEDRDt-1, ERDt).

We include the lagged dependent variable to allow for gradual adjustment of R&D in response to
changing conditions.

Standard errors are corrected for both autocorrelation and

heteroskedasticity.
In this equation, energy R&D is endogenous, as both it and total sectoral-level R&D are
influenced by factors such as energy prices.

Lagged industry-performed R&D is also

endogenous. Thus, we use an instrumental variables approach, using lagged values of the other
independent variables, total company-financed energy R&D spending in year t-2 (ERDt-2), the
price of energy,4 gross domestic product, defense spending, and lagged federal energy R&D
spending as instruments.5
One limitation to the above analysis is that industry-level energy R&D data are not
available for all industries.

Although published energy R&D data include industry-level

breakdowns, there are many missing observations in these data. This is particularly true in
industries that do not perform much energy R&D. Thus, in this regression we are only able to
include economy-wide energy R&D financed and performed by industry. This allows us to
focus on crowding out across sectors. That is, as the total level of energy R&D spending goes

3

Unfortunately, there are several missing observations in the industry-level data for federally-funded R&D
performed by industry, so that we can only include aggregate levels of government-funded R&D.

Energy price data come from the US Energy Information Administration, and are the consumption-weighted
average price for primary energy and retail electricity in the four end-use sectors (residential, commercial, industrial,
and transportation).
5
Because of the large share of R&D spending that goes to defense, particularly during the 1980s, Lichtenberg
(1987) finds a negative relationship between defense spending and the share of R&D going to energy. Based on
this, we include defense R&D as an instrumental variable.

6
up, do R&D resources flow from non-energy sectors to those doing more energy R&D? Figure 1
shows the trends in this variable, for both company-financed and federal-government financed
energy R&D performed by industry.
Our strategy for identifying crowding out across industries is to see how changes in the
overall level of energy R&D spending affect company R&D performance at the industry-level.
However, because we have total industry-level R&D on the left-hand side, but economy-wide
energy R&D on the right-hand side, our dependent variable includes energy R&D financed by
that industry. Since our dependent variable will, in some cases, include energy R&D for that
industry, careful interpretation of the coefficient on overall energy R&D is needed. A coefficient
of 0 suggests that R&D in that industry is not affected by increases in overall energy R&D.
Whether no effect on total industry-level R&D should be considered crowding out depends on
the ex ante level of energy R&D in the industry. In industries that perform a significant amount
of energy R&D, finding no increase in industry-wide R&D when energy R&D increases suggests
the industry has cut back on other types of R&D. However, a coefficient of 0 in an industry that
does not perform energy R&D, such as the food industry, suggests that crowding out is not a
problem. For these industries, we would be concerned about crowding out only if the coefficient
on energy R&D was negative – implying that an economy-wide increase in energy R&D took
R&D resources away from this industry.
Thus, we divide our sample of industries into two groups. We begin by looking at the
percentage of R&D devoted to energy R&D in years for which data are available. We then
separately consider industries for which spent, on average, 5% or more of total R&D
expenditures on energy R&D and those which spent less than 5% on energy R&D.6 Because of

6

For sensitivity analysis, we also present results using cutoffs of 1% and 10% for energy-R&D intensive industries.

7
data availability, we look at two samples. Using data from 1983-1997, we are able to include 16
industries. However, this does not allow us to look at crowding out during the energy crisis of
the 1970s, when energy R&D levels were highest. Thus, we also look at a subsample of 7
industries that have data available from 1973-1997. Tables 1 and 2 list the industries in the
larger and smaller samples, respectively, along with descriptive data on the key industry
variables. The tables also show the average percentage of R&D devoted to energy within each
sector, for the years in which industry-level detail is available. In each table, the industries are
sorted by this percentage. Finally, note that the last two lines of each table present summary
statistics for all industries with more than or less than five percent of R&D devoted to energy. In
both samples, energy intensive industries are larger. These include industries such as petroleum
refining and transportation equipment.
We start with the results for the larger sample, which begins in 1983. Table 3 presents
these results. Panel A presents results for our preferred model. The first two columns present
results for industries that perform little energy R&D. Here, we see no evidence of crowding out.
The insignificant coefficient on economy-wide private energy R&D spending suggests that
increases in energy R&D elsewhere in the economy have no effect on overall R&D spending in
these specific industries. This result holds using either a 1% or 5% cut-off for energy-R&D
intensive industries. Thus, we find that increases in energy R&D spending do not appear to
crowd out R&D in unrelated sectors.
Results for other variables are generally as expected. The model suggests that R&D
adjusts gradually, as the coefficient on lagged company R&D spending is significant and close to
1. Industry value added increases R&D, although the magnitude of this effect is small. Note
from Table 1 that several of the industries in the low energy R&D group are industries with low

8
overall R&D intensities, which might explain this low magnitude. Finally, the negative sign on
federal R&D suggests crowding out from government R&D, although this coefficient is
insignificant for low energy R&D industries.
For industries that spend 5% or more of their R&D budget on energy R&D, the results
are similar, but the interpretation is different. In columns 3 and 4, we see a coefficient on energy
R&D that is not statistically different from zero. Since these are industries that perform energy
R&D, the null hypothesis of no crowding out would be that the coefficient on energy R&D
equals 1. That is, every dollar spent on energy R&D should be new spending, so that total R&D
in the industry increases.

That null hypothesis is clearly rejected in all cases, suggesting

crowding out within those sectors that perform energy R&D. As before, the coefficients on other
variables appear reasonable. Of particular interest here is the coefficient on value added of about
0.02. This is consistent with the fact that just over two percent of GDP is devoted to energy
R&D. We also see evidence for a small crowding out effect from federal R&D that is now
statistically significant.
One concern is the negative coefficient on energy R&D in column 4. One issue may be
endogeneity, particularly if other shocks to the economy, such as higher energy prices, affect
industry value added. To address this, we remove one outlier industry: petroleum refining and
extraction. Over 50% of R&D goes to energy in this sector, compared to 9% in the next highest
sector. Without petroleum, the results are similar, but the coefficient on energy R&D is now
positive. Still, we can reject the null hypothesis that this coefficient equals 1, suggesting some
crowding out in these industries.
A second potential concern with these results is that we have a weak instruments
problem. While our instruments our valid, as suggested by the high p-values for Hansen’s J-

9
statistic (Baum et al. 2007), the Wald F statistic based on the Kleibergen-Paap rk statistic is less
than the “rule of thumb” of 10, suggesting weak instruments (Staiger and Stock, 1997; Baum et
al., 2007). This results from the poor fit between our instruments and the lagged dependent
variable. For each regression, the F-stat for the first-stage regression of the lagged dependent
variable is less than 10, whereas the F-stat for the first-stage regression of the energy R&D
variable is consistently much larger than 10. To address this, panel B of Table 3 presents an
alternative estimation strategy, in which the three-year lag of the dependent variable is also used
as an instrument. While one might expect the three-year lag to be endogenous, particularly if
adjustment is gradual, Hansen’s J-statistic still confirms the validity of our selected instruments.
Moreover, for three of our specifications, the Wald F statistic based on the Kleibergen-Paap rk
statistic is now greater than 10, and we reject the null hypothesis that the model is
underidentified, at least at the 10 percent level, for each specification. Most importantly, the
main results do not change. We still see no evidence of crowding out in low energy R&D
industries, and evidence suggestive of crowding out in high-energy R&D industries.
Turning in Table 4 to the sample of 7 industries with data from 1973-1998, we find
similar results. Because of the larger amount of energy R&D performed during the 1970s, here
we use 5% and 10% as cutoffs for energy R&D intensity, as none of the industries in this sample
spend less than one percent of R&D on energy research. Once again, in low energy R&D
industries, there is no measurable crowding out effect: Moreover, the value of other coefficients,
such as value added, is also consistent with expectations. In high energy R&D industries, we
again get a negative effect on total energy R&D. Here, omitting petroleum extraction and
refining does not change the result. Also as before, the results do not change when the three-year
lag of the dependent variable is used as an additional instrument.

10
The results of these regressions suggest that, during past spikes in energy research
activity, research funding did not flow from non-energy R&D sectors to sectors performing
R&D. While the results raise the possibility of crowding out within these energy R&D sectors –
that is, that new energy R&D in these sectors comes at the expense of other R&D in these
sectors, these results appear less certain. For example, the conclusions about crowding out in
these sectors do not change as the cutoff used to define high energy R&D sectors changes. This
poses problems for interpretation. Consider the chemical industry, which spends 3.2% of its
R&D on energy-related research. Using the one percent cutoff in table 3 would suggest that the
chemical industry experiences crowding out when energy research increases. However, using a
five percent cutoff would suggest that it does not.
A final concern with the regressions for high energy R&D industries is that all energy
R&D spending does not go to a single industry. For example, if one new dollar of energy R&D
is equally shared among four industries, the appropriate test for crowding out would be whether
the coefficient on energy R&D equals 0.25. Using the average share of energy R&D assigned to
industry i for years for which industry-level energy R&D data are available, we find that this
ranges from 1.5% for primary metals to 27% for petroleum refining. Thus, while we reject the
null hypothesis that the coefficient on energy R&D is 1 in these models, in most cases we cannot
reject the null hypothesis that the coefficient is 0.27 – that is, that 27% of the total energy R&D
is going to industry i.
Given this concern, Table 5 presents one additional set of regressions for high-energy
R&D industries. Here, we replace the economy-wide level of energy R&D with an estimated
value for each industry, found by multiplying the economy-wide energy R&D data by the
average share of energy R&D going to that industry from years in which industry-specific data

11
are available. These results are suggestive of crowding out, but are very imprecise.7 Here, the
null hypothesis of no crowding out again implies that the coefficient on energy R&D be one –
that all new energy R&D is new R&D. Except for the 1983-1997 data without refineries, we
reject this null hypothesis. However, the negative signs on these coefficients are troubling
(although not significant), as are the large magnitudes. At best, we can only say that the results
for industries that perform energy R&D are ambiguous, and await better data. Given this
ambiguity, we turn next to firm-level patent data, to take a closer look at the changes occurring
within firms as energy R&D increases.

II. Crowding Out Within Sectors
To address the question of crowding out within sectors, we look at the research decisions
made by individual firms. In principle, we would like to know if increases in energy R&D at the
firm level crowd out other types of R&D. Unfortunately, R&D data are not available at the firm
level with this level of detail. Instead, we use patents as a proxy for energy and other R&D.8
Using patent data, we classify firm research outcomes as energy-related or not. We then ask
whether increases in energy-related research lead to decreases in other research.
Our model specification is purposely sparse.

Define OPATi,t as non-energy patents

assigned to firm i, with an application year of t. Similarly, EPATi,t represents energy patents
from these same firms. Xi,t represents a vector of firm-specific control variables, such as capital,
sales, or debt, to control for firm size. We estimate an equation of the form:

7

Table 5 is equivalent to panel A of Tables 3 and 4. Results do not change when using R&Di,t-3 as an instrument,
except for the case without refineries between 1973-1997. However, for that case, Hansen’s J test shows that the
instruments are invalid. Results are available from the authors upon request.
8
Griliches (1990) shows that patents, sorted by their year of application, are strongly correlated with R&D
expenditures, and thus make a good proxy for R&D spending. For a discussion of other applications of patent data
in environmental economics, see Popp (2005).

12
(2)

OPATi,t = f(OPATi,t-1, EPATi,t, Xi,t, ai, bt),

where ai and bt represent firm and year fixed-effects. Note that because we are using patents as a
proxy for R&D spending, we do not include R&D spending as a control variable. While one
would expect increases in R&D to increase patenting activity, it does not allow us to determine
whether one type of R&D has replaced the other. We include year effects to allow for changes
in patent policy that change the propensity to patent among all inventors, and to control for
truncation problems in the last years of our data. Because not all patent applications are made
public, we obtain the application years of our patents from the final granted patent publication.
We have data on patents granted through 2002. Since some patent applications filed in the late
1990s and early 2000s would still have been pending in 2002, counts of patent applications in
these years will be too low. As such, we restrict our analysis to patent applications filed between
1970 and 1999. Year dummies correct for any remaining truncation problem.

A. Data
We examine data for two types of energy innovations. First, we look at patents aimed at
new energy technologies. These include renewable technologies such as wind and solar power,
as well as new sources that may use fossil fuels, such as fuel cells and coal liquefaction. This
sample includes firms from a broad cross-section of industries. To focus more closely on a
specific industry, we also look at new technologies in the automotive sector. Here, we include
fuel cells and hybrid vehicles, as well as innovations designed to improve the fuel economy of
internal combustion engines.
Our patent data comes from two sources. First, we identify relevant energy patents using
the Delphion patent database, using a combination of patent classification codes and, in the case

13
of energy efficiency patents, appropriate keywords.9

Appendix A shows the technologies

included in our paper, along with the relevant search strategies for each. To identify all patents
granted to firms working in these fields, we use the NBER patent database (Hall, Jaffe, &
Trajtenberg, 2001). Based on the firm information available in the NBER database, this leaves
us with a sample of patents granted from 1971-2002.10
From this, we calculated the total number of patents granted to each firm in our sample,
along with the number of energy patents. We eliminated firms where nearly all patents are
energy patents, such as International Fuel Cells or Ballard Power Systems (a fuel cell
manufacturer).11 We also eliminated firms with less than 1.5% of their patents in one of our
energy categories. This eliminates large, diversified firms such as General Electric and some
chemical companies. In both cases, the percentage of energy patents is so small that one would
not expect to identify any reasonable relationship between energy and other patents. For the
remaining firms, we searched Compustat to identify firm-specific variables. Our firm-specific
variables, all measured in billions of 2000 dollars, are capital (Compustat item #8: Property,
Plant, and Equipment – Total (Net)), net sales (Compustat item #18), and debt (Compustat item
#9). Using only firms with greater than 1.5% of their patents in either technology area, this
leaves us with a sample of 13 firms for automotive technology and 31 firms for alternative
energy. Table 6 displays, by firm, average values for each of the variables in our dataset.
To get a sense of who patents in these technology areas, Tables 7 and 8 present the top
patent assignees by field. Table 7 lists the top 20 assignees for each field. Note that these two

The NBER database limits us to patents granted from 1968, as firm identifiers are not available before that date.
Similarly, the NBER data currently ends in 2002. However, we only use patents granted from 1971 because the
Delphion database only includes abstracts for keyword searching on patents beginning in 1971.
11
Our initial cutoff for this was firms with more than 2/3 of their patents pertaining to energy. However, once we
search for financial data on the remaining firms, no firm with more than 29% of their patents pertaining to energy
remain in the dataset.
10

14
lists are dominated by large firms with just a few percent of their total patents falling in these
categories. Only a few predominately energy companies, such as Ballard Power Systems and
International Fuel Cells Corporation, appear in the top 20. For each technology area, Table 8
lists the top 20 firms having the greatest percentage of their patents falling in one of these
categories. Here, we only include firms with 10 or more patents in these areas, as there are
hundreds of firms that have only one relevant energy patent and no other patents. There are
many companies specializing in the alternative energy field, as relevant energy patents comprise
70% or more of the total patent portfolio for each of the firms in the top 20. In contrast, the top
20 automotive energy firms include companies for which energy patents comprise just 16% or
more of their patent portfolio.
In both cases, the distribution of assignees is highly skewed. Not counting patents
assigned to individuals, there are 3,059 unique patent assignees in the alternative energy field. Of
these, 1,935 have just one alternative energy patent. Only 17% of alternative energy patents are
assigned to the top 20 assignees (not counting individually assigned patents). There are 18,107
total patents in this field. The companies included in our regression have 2,011 of these, or 11
percent. For these 32 firms, energy patents represent 3.6 percent of their total patenting activity.
For automotive technologies, there are 1,438 unique patent assignees for 9,895 total patents. Of
these, 813 have just one automotive energy patent. Larger firms play a more important role here,
as 32 percent of patents are assigned to the top 20 assignees (again, not counting individually
assigned patents). The companies included in our regression have 1,269 of these, or 13 percent.
Energy patents represent 3.9 percent of total patenting activity for these 14 firms.
Finally, Figures 2 and 3 show energy and non-energy patents for the firms in our
alternative energy and automotive energy regressions, respectively. In each, patents are sorted

15
by the year of application. The number of energy patent applications per year is on the left yaxis, and the number of non-energy patent applications per year is on the right y- axis. Note that
alternative energy patents increase during the energy crises of the 1970s. Afterwards, energy
patents decline, and non-energy patents increase, suggesting possible crowding out.

For

automotive energy patents, the bulk of applications occur more recently, as a result of research
on fuel cell and hybrid vehicles. Until this recent spike, both energy and non-energy patents
tended to move together. The figure suggests crowding out may occur at the end of the sample.

B. Results
Tables 9 through 12 present results for alternative energy patents and automotive energy
patents, respectively. In each case, the null hypothesis is that energy patents do not crowd out
other patents, which we fail to reject unless the coefficient on energy patents is significantly
different from zero. Tables 9 and 11 include six specifications – three including year dummies,
and three that replace the year dummies with a time trend. Using the time trend provides
additional degrees of freedom, and allows us to use energy prices as an additional instrument for
energy patents. However, the trend may fail to capture discrete changes in patent policy, nor any
remaining truncation bias in our data. To allow for the possibility of gradual adjustments, we
present specifications with a lagged dependent variable. In these models, both the lagged
dependent variable and energy patents are endogenous. We use the first two lagged values of the
exogenous dependent variables (sales, debt, and capital, as well as the time dummies or trend) as
instruments, along with second-year lagged values of energy patents. In addition, we use current
and lagged energy prices as instruments in the model using a time trend. Tables 10 and 12
present additional sensitivity analysis to assess the validity of our instruments. All regressions

16
use GMM estimation with firm fixed effects.

Standard errors are corrected for both

autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity.
We look first at the results for alternative energy technologies. The first three columns of
Table 9 present results of the model with year dummies, and the last three present results of the
model with a time trend. The evidence for crowding out is mixed. In each model, the coefficient
on energy patents is negative, and slightly larger than 1, suggesting that a new energy patent
fully crowds out a non-energy patent. However, these coefficients are only significant in column
(1), which uses year dummies and a full set of controls. As expected the effect of sales is
positive, but is not significant in the model including capital and debt.12 The effect of capital and
debt is insignificant. Lagged other patents has a positive coefficient less than one, suggesting a
gradual adjustment process.
The positive effect of sales on patenting is also suggestive of crowding out. Crowding
out is most likely to occur when firms face financial constraints, so that they are unable to take
advantage of all profitable research opportunities. In the existing literature on R&D financing,
tests of financial constraints are indirect (see, for example, Hall 2002). Intuition about these tests
can be gained by considering what firms choose to do with new cash flow. If firms choose to
invest new cash flow in additional R&D, this suggests that the firm faced research opportunities
that it had not taken advantage of due to financial constraints. That increased revenues from
sales leads to more patenting suggests that these alternative energy firms may face R&D
financing constraints.13

12

The model uses lagged sales, on the assumption that increased revenues from new sales are used to fund R&D in
the following year.
13
We choose not to overemphasize this result, as the ideal measure of cash flow would be net profits. In results not
reported here, we found net profits to consistently have an insignificant effect on other patenting. As these results
also magnify the weak instruments problem noted below, we omit profits from the models in this paper.

17
Unfortunately, regression diagnostics suggest that our instrumental variables may not be
sufficient. The fit of the model is generally good, with R2 statistics near 0.6. As shown by the pvalue from Hansen’s J statistic presented below the estimates, we cannot reject the null
hypothesis that the instruments are valid.

However, the Wald F statistic based on the

Kleibergen-Paap rk statistic is less than the “rule of thumb” of 10, suggesting weak instruments
(Staiger and Stock, 1997; Baum et al., 2007).
Further exploration suggests that the weak instruments problem comes from the lagged
dependent variable. For instance, in column (1), the F-statistic for the first-stage equation for
lagged other patents is just 2.69, where as it is 13.03 for the first-stage equation for energy
patents. Given this, Table 10 shows results from two additional specifications.14 First, in
columns (2) and (5) we use 3-year lagged Other Patents as an additional instrument. While one
might expect this to be endogenous, particularly if the adjustment process is slow, we still do not
reject the null hypothesis that the instruments are valid using Hansen’s J-statistic. As would be
expected, the F-statistic for our instruments now improves substantially. Most importantly, this
does not change our crowding out result, which is still significant when using a complete set of
year dummies. The magnitude of the adjustment parameter falls slightly, but is still significant.
Moreover, with better instruments, the effect of sales is now significant in both columns (2) and
(5). Finally, columns (3) and (6) present results of a model that excludes the lagged dependent
variable. As expected, the F-statistic now suggests that our instruments for energy patents are
sufficient. However, our estimates are slightly less precise, and the R2 statistics are much lower
without the lagged dependent variable. Moreover, while the coefficient on energy patents is still

14

To conserve space, we focus on the model with all three controls for firm characteristics.

18
negative, it is now insignificant. Given the strong significance of the lagged dependent variable,
dropping it from the model provides unsatisfactory results.
The results for automotive energy technologies (Table 11) are less satisfying. As noted
in the previous section, there are fewer firms in this dataset, leaving us with only 254
observations, compared to 608 for the alternative energy regressions. As a result, although the
signs of our estimated coefficients are as expected, only capital is statistically significant at even
the 10 percent level.15

As before, we have a weak instruments problem.

Moreover, the

Kleibergen-Paap rk statistic (2006) suggests that the model is unidentified except when sales are
the only dependent variable. As shown in Table 12, using the three-year lag of the dependent
variable partially addresses the weak instruments problem, although the F-statistic for the
instruments is still less than 10. However, the improved fit of the first stage regressions results
in statistical significance for both capital and the lagged dependent variable. As before, dropping
the lagged dependent variable completely leads to less satisfactory results. Overall, crowding
out seems to be less of a problem for the automotive industry. While this may be due to the
larger size of these firms, given our smaller sample size, we have less confidence in this result
than for our results using alternative energy patents.

C. What is Crowded Out?
Given the evidence of crowding out from alternative energy innovations, we take a closer
look at innovations in a subset of our sample to see what might be lost when alternative energy
innovation increases. To be able to categorize these other patents in greater detail, we limit our
15

Following the discussion of financial constraints above, it is somewhat comforting that both energy patents and
sales have no effect on other patents. Also, the automotive firms in our sample are larger than the alternative energy
firms, with an average value of capital two billion dollars higher, and average assets that are more than double those
of the alternative energy firms. One would expect larger firms to be less likely to face financial constraints, and thus
less likely to suffer from crowding out of R&D resources.

19
focus to the 12 firms from our alternative energy sample that are energy refinery companies.16
Using patent classifications, we categorize all of the patents from these 12 firms into one of 7
technology groups: alternative energy, coal-based fuels, environmental, refining, chemistry,
drilling wells, and other technologies. Alternative energy patents include traditional renewable
sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal. Coal-based fuels include coal gasification and coal
liquefaction patents.

In the regression analysis of the previous section, both of these are

categorized as alternative energy patents. Among the refineries, these coal-based fuels are an
important component of alternative energy innovation, comprising two-third of the alternative
energy patents for these firms. Thus, we consider these separately from other alternative energy
patents. Environmental patents pertain to pollution control, and include techniques for cleaning
up oil spills, as well as isomerization refining techniques developed as part of the phase-out of
lead from gasoline and reformulated fuels. Appendix B presents a complete list of the patent
classifications in each technology group. Figure 4 shows trends in these seven groups over time.
Table 13 shows the correlation between patent applications per year in each category.17
Because overall patent counts move together over time (for instance, as a result of changing firm
revenues), we look at both correlations between counts of patents in each group, as well as
correlations between the percentage of each year’s patents belonging to each group. Using raw
patent counts, all correlations are positive. However, the two smallest correlations are between
alternative energy and refining, and coal-based fuels and refining. The correlations between
either alternative fuels or coal-based fuels and environmental patents are also small. Using
correlations between the percentage of patents in each category per year, we now see several
negative correlations. This is expected, since the sum of percentages in each year must sum to
16

These firms are Amoco, Atlantic Richfield, Chevron, Conoco, ExxonMobil, Gulf, Kerr-McGee, Mobil,
Occidental, Standard Oil, Texaco, and Tosco.
17
We use patents from 1973-1999, as these are the years appearing in the regression analysis.

20
100. Here, the correlation between alternative energy patents and refining patents is strongly
negative, at -0.70. The same holds true for the correlation between coal-based fuels and refining.
The correlation between alternative energy and pollution control innovations is also negative, but
its magnitude is much smaller, at -0.39. Finally, to focus on the period where crowding out is
most likely, panels C and D of Table 13 repeat the analysis for only those patents from 19731987. As shown in Figure 4, this covers the period in which alternative energy innovation
increased and then returned to pre-energy crisis levels. While refinery patents still are most
likely to be crowded out, we also see evidence of crowding out for patents pertaining to drilling
wells. The correlation between the number of alternative energy patents and wells patents is
0.30, and the correlation between the percentages of these patents is -0.65.

While only

suggestive, these correlations provide evidence that much of what is crowded out from increased
alternative energy research are innovations on refining and drilling wells, both of which would
increase production of fossil fuels. Thus, while it is important for such crowding out to be
accounted for in integrated assessment models, these results also suggest that one effect of
policies designed to increase alternative energy R&D is to lower incentives for R&D on
traditional fossil fuel energy sources.

III. The Social Value of Energy Innovations
While the analysis of the preceding section provides some evidence as to the types of
research that are crowded out, it does not tell us anything about the social value of this research.
Economists consistently find that the social returns to research are higher than a firm’s private
returns.18 This deviation results from knowledge spillovers due to the public-good nature of new
18

See, for example, Mansfield (1977, 1996), Pakes (1985), Jaffe (1986), Hall (1996), and Jones and Williams
(1998).

21
knowledge. A successful innovator will capture some rewards, but those rewards will always be
only a fraction—and sometimes a very small fraction—of the overall benefits to society of the
innovation. Hence innovation creates positive externalities in the form of knowledge spillovers
for other firms and consumers.
If the social returns to new alternative energy R&D are no different from the social
returns to the R&D that is crowded out, then simply measuring the magnitude of crowding out is
sufficient. However, if these social returns differ, the ultimate economic effect of crowding out
will be miscalculated unless these differences are accounted for. A priori, there are two reasons
to expect that alternative energy research may have a greater social value than other research.
First, comparatively less research has been done on alternative energy than other fields,
particularly at the beginning of our sample. As a result, alternative energy starts from a lower
knowledge base, leading to greater opportunities for big breakthroughs and positive spillovers
than more mature technologies. Second, energy technologies may have influence in many
sectors, raising the possibility that innovations will have the characteristics of General Purpose
Technologies (GPT) (see, for example, Helpman, 1998).
We use two measures of social value. Both make use of patent citation data. Many
researchers have used patent citations as an indicator of the value of a patent.19 First, we
consider the number of patent citations received by each patent in our sample. We assume more
frequently cited patents have more value to society, as they provide the building blocks to a
larger number of future innovations. Second, we use a measure of patent generality described in
Hall et al. (2001). Generality asks whether a patent is cited by other patents from many different
technological fields, or just by other similar patents. The index ranges from 0-1, with higher
19

See, for example, Lanjouw & Schankerman (2004) Popp (2006b), and the papers cited in Jaffe & Trajtenberg
(2002).

22
values representing more general patents. More formally, generality is a Herfindahl index
defined as
ni

Generality i = 1 − ∑ s ij2

(3)

j

where sij denotes the percentage of citations received by patent i from patents in patent class j,
out of a total of ni patent classes. Our assumption is that more general patents provide more
social value, as they provide building blocks to innovations in more sectors of the economy.
Our analysis makes use of the patents from the previous section. Citation data come from
the NBER patent database, which includes all citations made by patents granted between 1975
and 2002. Based on this, we restrict our analysis to patents with application years between 19751999. Table 14 provides descriptive data on generality and citations received by both energy and
non-energy patents in our database. In addition, a more detailed breakdown is provided for the
seven technology groups introduced for refineries in the previous section. The descriptive data
suggests that alternative energy patents are cited more frequently, and are more general, than
other patents.
However, simply looking at descriptive data does not tell the whole story, as citation
patterns vary over time, as well as across technologies.

For example, the number of

opportunities to be cited is important. Patents are likely to receive more citations if there are
more patents in the years immediately following publication. Moreover, older patents, such as
the bulk of alternative energy patents, have had more chances to be cited than more recent
patents. In addition, more recently granted patents are more likely to cite previous patents, as a
result of both computerized data bases making searching for relevant patents easier, as well as
increasing legal pressure to include all relevant citations in the final patent. Regression analysis

23
allows us to control for such features, using fixed effects for patent application year to control for
the number of citing opportunities that follow.
For both citations and generality, our regression takes the following form. Define yi as
the variable of interest – either the subsequent citations received by patent i, or the generality
index of patent i. Dummy variables indicate whether or not the patent is assigned to a firm from
our alternative energy sample or our automotive sample, and whether or not the patent is an
alternative energy or automotive energy patent. For non-energy patents, we also include a
dummy variable for the general technology type, based on the classification system used in the
NBER patent database. This accounts for the general finding that some fields are more active
than others, and thus more likely to receive citations. Our regression becomes:
(4)

yi = f(Alternative Energy Dummy, Automotive Energy Dummy, Alternative Energy Firm
Dummy, Technology Dummy, year fixed effects)

As many patents are never cited, we use a generalized negative binomial regression for the
citation analysis, allowing the overdispersion parameter to differ for automotive and alternative
energy firms. Results are reported as eβ, so that they can be interpreted as the likelihood of
citation relative to a base case patent, a non-energy patent belonging to an automotive firm.
Because generality is bounded by 0 and 1, we use a Tobit regression to examine whether energy
patents are more general than other patents assigned to the firms in our sample. We do a similar
analysis of refinery patents, using only dummies for the seven technology groups and year fixed
effects. Because refinery patents are most likely to be crowded out, they are the excluded
category.
Table 15 presents our results. Panel A confirms that both alternative energy patents and
automotive energy patents are more likely to be cited than other patents from these firms.

24
Interestingly, the social value of all patents from the energy companies is higher, as patents from
these firms are 88 percent more likely to be cited than those from automotive firms. Alternative
energy patents from these firms an additional 15 percent more likely to be cited. Automotive
energy patents are 53 percent more likely to be cited than non-energy patents from these firms.
Similarly, as shown in the last column, both alternative energy patents and automotive energy
patents are more general than other patents from these firms.
Panel B shows the results using only patents from the 12 energy refineries, allowing us to
compare the value of alternative energy patents to those most likely to be crowded out. Our
excluded category is refining patents. While alternative energy patents are more general than
refining patents, suggesting that they do impact more areas of the economy than the innovations
they replace, their social value is not much higher. These patents are 7 percent more likely to be
cited, but the result is not statistically significant. Thus, while the crowding out effect within the
refining sector appears to have a positive environmental effect, by crowding out research
designed to enhance the production of fossil fuels, the value of these innovations to future
researchers is no different than the value of the research that is crowded out.

IV. Discussion
As calls for increased energy R&D strengthen, it is important to know where funding for
these efforts will come from. In particular, to the extent that new energy R&D funding crowds
out other R&D efforts, the social benefits to new energy R&D will be dampened. Using both
industry and firm-level data from the United States, this paper takes a first look at the source of
energy R&D. Using industry data, we find little evidence of crowding out across sectors.
Economy wide increases in energy R&D do not appear to draw R&D resources away from those

25
industries that are not actively involved in energy research, mitigating the concern that new
energy R&D programs will draw resources away from other innovative sectors of the economy.
Looking within sectors that do perform significant energy R&D, the results are mixed.
Industry-level regressions suggest that within-sector crowding out may be an issue, as increases
in energy R&D within these industries do not appear to be associated with equivalent increases
in overall R&D within these industries. While better data are needed to substantiate this claim,
the results raise the possibility that firms in these industries move R&D resources from other
areas to support increases in energy R&D. Data limitations make the results difficult to interpret,
however, particularly for firms performing moderate levels of energy R&D. One particular
concern is that our energy R&D variable measures economy-wide energy R&D levels, rather
than industry-specific levels.
Because of these concerns, we use firm-level patent data to take a closer look at two
types of energy research.

Since we combine these patent data with financial data from

Compustat, our sample is restricted to large, publicly traded firms. Within these firms, we find
evidence of crowding out among companies working on alternative energy technologies –
increases in the number of energy patents assigned to a firm do lead to decreases in other types
of patents by these firms – but not for companies working on automotive technologies. Using
more detailed patent data on refinery companies, we find that alternative energy research most
likely crowded out innovations on refining and wells. This is consistent with the notion that any
apparent crowding out reacts to market incentives – as opportunities for alternative energy
research become more profitable, we would expect research opportunities for traditional fossil
fuels to appear less appealing to firms. Given that the broader sample of energy firms does
appear to face some financing constraints (as shown by the positive effect of sales on patents),

26
we cannot conclude that the observed crowding out is only a result of firms moving resources
from less profitable to more profitable ventures. However, it does suggest that any crowding out
which occurred in this industry had a positive environmental effect, by enhancing greener
technologies at the expense of dirtier ones.
Finally, we use patent citation data to compare the social value of energy research to
other research by these firms. We find that energy patents are cited more frequently, suggesting
that they provide greater value to future inventors. They are also more general as they are cited
by a larger range of other patents than non-energy innovations. This is consistent with the notion
that energy innovations can have a broad impact on the economy, because of the importance of
energy use throughout the economy. However, confining our analysis to refineries, we find no
difference in the social value of alternative energy patents compared to the refining and wells
patents most likely to be crowded out by alternative energy research.
Our results have implications both for policy and for integrated assessment modelers.
For policy, a key result is that any crowding out that may occur appears to affect dirty
technologies. Thus, policies enhancing research incentives for green technologies have the
additional desired effect of reducing incentives for research on dirty technologies such as fossil
fuels. To illustrate the importance of this, consider the results of Gerlagh (2008), who presents a
climate model allowing for a choice of carbon-energy producing R&D, carbon-energy saving
R&D, and neutral R&D. Gerlagh simulates the effect of a carbon tax on his model, and finds
that carbon-producing R&D, rather than neutral R&D, is crowded out by induced carbon-energy
saving R&D. As a result, the impact of induced technological change is larger than in other
models with crowding out, with optimal carbon taxes falling by a factor of 2.

27
For integrated assessment modelers, the results highlight the importance of incorporating
the costs of R&D in the model.

Many integrated assessment models include detailed

descriptions of alternative energy research, but treat other forms of technological change as
exogenous. As this exogenous technological change includes research that may decline when
alternative energy research increases, not adjusting this exogenous rate will double-count gains
from induced technological change, even if the decrease in research results from profitmaximizing decisions of how to allocate research inputs, rather than crowding out from financial
constraints.

The table shows average values for variables, by firm. The columns labeled “pct energy (pct of total)” are the percentage of energy patents in the firms total
patent portfolio (column3 or 4 divided by column 5). Columns labeled “pct energy (average)” show the average of the annual share of energy patents for each
firm. Only patents with application years between 1970 & 1999 are used for this table, as these cutoffs are used in the regression analysis that follows.
