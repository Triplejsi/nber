Trade Restrictions as

ABSTRACT

This paper deals with the effect of trade restrictions on competition In Ol1gopolIstc markets. Quantitative

restrictions, such as

VER's (Voluntary Export Restrictions) are shown to affect the extent
to which foreign firms can
compete in the domestic market, and hence
to raise the equilibrium prices and

profits of both domestic and for—

restrictions are not too severe. This increase
prices and profits is shown to make it unlikely for VER's to raise

eign firms — when such

in

National Welfare. In addition, I show
that domestic output may fall
due to the VER's. For these
reasons, VER's do not seem to be desir-

able ways of restricting imports.

Tariffs and Quotas are also shown to be non—equivalent in such
oligopoly models. A comparison of the effects of tariffs and quotas shows
that it would be in the interest of domestic manufacturers t lobby for

VER's instead of import equivalent tariffs. In addition, it is shown that
the foreign firm would prefer VER's to import equivalent tariffs, even if
tariff revenues were refunded to them Thus, the recent VER'S on Japanese
automobiles may well have been in the interests of both Japanese and Merican
firms, and at the expense of the nation as a whole.

Introduction
The analysis of trade restrictions has focused on their effects in the

polar cases of monopoly and competition, and hence, has neglected their
possible effects on the nature of strategic interaction between firms.
Interactions between firms are crucial in oligopolistic situations and when
the nature of interaction between firms is affected, the consequences of
"slight" restrictions are profound.

Voluntary export restraints (VER's) have been

increasingly used to

restrict imports recently. I show that when firms compete in prIces,
such
restraints alter the nature of interaction
direction and thereby raise (the

between firms in a Collusive

equilibrjn) prices and profits of all

fjrms. Hence, trade restrictions can impose on firms the collusion
they themselves were unable to achieve —

that

is, they can act as

facilitating practices. VER's affect the market, not because they are set
at restrictive levels, but because they impede the ability of firms to
compete effectively.

The increase in foreign profits due to a VER is shown to make it

unlikely for a VER to raise domestic welfare. In addition, tariffs are
shown to be fundamentally non—equivalent to quotas as quotas affect the
nature of strategic interaction between firms, while tariffs do not. This
is the analogue in oligopolistjc markets of Bhagwati's2 famous result for
the case of domestic monopoly.

2. The Model
The simplest model which permits me to show how a trade restriction
can affect oligopolistic interaction

is used. There are assumed to be two

firms, one home and one foreign, who produce differentiated products which
are substitutes for each other, and compete in prices in the domestic

product market3. The equilibrium concept is that of Nash Equilibrium.

Let

P be the price of the home products and P that of the foreign

one.

For any given P (P ) denote the profit maximizing price P (P) that

foreign (home) firm can charge by B (P) (B(P )). These constitute the

best response on the part of a firm to any price set by its competitor. By
definition, the Nash equilibrium is given by the pair (p,p*) which

satisfies

both B (P) = P

and B (P )

I will assume that a unique stable Nash equilibrium exists4. In

particular, I assume that profit functions are

In order to specify how a VER affects the equilibri, it is
to examine how it affects the best

necessary

responses of both firms. As these

depend on how their profit functions

are affected, we must first

carefully

examine how the latter are affected by a VER.
First consider the foreign firm's

profit function when it is

constrained to sell no more that "R". At

is depicted in Diagram 2 by the line P P when R is set at the
free

level of imports. At all points above PP the constraint is

binding.

*

At points below P P, the constraint is not binding.

The foreign firms iso—profit

vertical lines above P P because its

profits are independent of the

domestic firm's price in this region
*
as the VER is binding. Below P P,

they

are unaffected by the existence of a VER. They have a kink along P* P

as shown in Diagram 2.

In

*

the region where P P lies below B (P), this kink makes P*(P,R) the
*

best response function for the
foreign firm in the presence of a VER. In
the region where P*P lies above B *(P), its
best response function is

unaltered. This is illustrated in Diagram 2, where the dark line,

B (P. R) is the best

response function of the foreign firm Lwiith the VER.

Hence, formally:

B

(P. R) = P (P, R)

= B* (P)

*

if P (P. R) ) B (P)

*

*

if P (P. R) < B (P).

Now we turn to how the domestic firm's profits are affected by a VER

the line P P then the demand for

the foreign firm's product exceeds

the level of the VER. Hence, at these

would
prices some consumers of the foreign product would be rationed. This
affect the demand for the domestic firms product.

A natural way of

specifying the relationship between rationing in one market and its
spillover effects in another is to introduce arbitrage. If the firms
charge prices such that the demand for the foreign good exceeds R, there is

room for arbitrage profits to be made. Assume that if demand exceeds R, it
is as if the entire stock of the foreign good is thrown on the market for

what it will bring. Consumers lucky enough to get the foreign good at the
price charged, make profits by selling the good at a price that clears the

market. As the income effects of such transactions are assumed away, the
effect on the domestic firms demand is exactly what it would have been, if
the foreign firm was actually charging the price that cleared the market.

For any price, P charged by the foreign

other words, although the domestic

firm can make the VER bind on the foreign firm, it chooses to do so only if

the foreign firm's price is low. If the foreign products price is high
enough, it will not be in the interest of the domestic firm to make the

restriction bind. Hence, the best response of the domestic firm to any

The calculations for a special case of the example also show the

Table 1 summarizes these calculations.

The only parameter that effects

the
equilibrium is "b". "a" is only a scale parameter. Table 2 gives

numerical values on the assumption that "a" is equal to 10 and "b"

to 1.5. Expected profits of

both firms rise after the imposition of a VER.

The domestic firm's output is also lower on average.

foreign firm. Using the information in Table 1, it is easy to see that I =

1I(4b (b — 1).

.

Thus, I is decreasing in b. As the domestic firm becomes

less able to affect the foreign firm's

demand, it gains less by using the

advantage given to it by the VER imposed on the foreign firm.

3.A Stecial Case
A natural question that arises at this point is what the effects of a

VER might have been had there been

might seem to contradict the assumption that the two goods are substitutes.
However, although unlikely, it seems possible

for them to be consistent

with each other locallIV. A possible argument is as follows.
Market demand consists of aggregated individual demands. Some
individuals may choose to purchase the

substitute good when rationed, while

others may not. If there is no resale, the effect of a ration in one
market, on the demand in the other, depends on which consumers get the

rationed good. If consumers who substitute between products are assigned
the rationed good, while consumers whose
in the event of being rationed, are

rationed, the ration need not affect

demand for the substitute good. The no spilloverS

assumption is made,

because of any belief in its realism, but because it allows me to isolate
one effect of a VER from the other.

Even with this assumption, a VER close

to the free trade level can be shown to raise both firms profits.
Theorem 4

If there are no spillovers in demand, and the equilibrium is

stable in the presence of a VER, a VER set slightly below the free trade
level must raise both firms profits and prices.
Proof

The reason is very simple and is

by the presence of a VER on the

foreign firm's best response function

must rise as well.

4. The Effects of Tariffs and_Quotas
The analysis of the previous section allows us to
compare the effects
of a VER or quota with those
of an import equivalent tariff.
It is shown
that:

(1) Prices under a tariff are lower than those under the VER
set at

the post tariff import levels.

(2) The profits of the domestic firm are

also higher under the VER; (3) If the VER is set close to the
free trade
level of output, it will be
preferred by the foreign firm to no

would prefer the Y to the

are positive)12 moves the foreign firm's

reaction function to the right13

as in Diagram 5. The analysis

comparing a VER to an equivalent tariff

is similar to that comparing a VER

at the Nash equilibrium level, to the equilibrium in the absence of any
restriction. To substantiate the first point1 compare the level of domestic
prices under a quantitative

restriction set at the level of imports induced

by a tariff, and the tariff.

The former are greater than the latter.
*

This is shown in Diagram 5. B (p,t) is the best response

function of the

foreign firm with the tariff, and RT is the level of imports with the

tariff.

R *

B (P, R1,) and B (P , RT) are the best responses of the foreign and

domestic firms respectively in the presence of a VER at the level of
imports prevailing under the tariff at rate t.

The notation used in

Diagram 5 corresponds to that previously introduced for examining the

L

effect of a VER. Both p and p

H

T
are above p , the price of the home

good with the tariff. Also, p is greater that p

the price of the

foreign good with the tariff. Thus, prices are greater under the VER than
under the import equivalent tariff.

It is also easy to see that the domestic firm's profits are higher
under the VER as compared to their level under the tariff, as Vt

is

greater than
The foreign firm's profits must rise due to a VER as long as the VER

is not too severe. As shown, the profits of the foreign firm must rise if
the restriction is set at the free trade level. As its profits are
strictly greater with a VER at the free trade level, continuity arguments
show that they should remain so when Rt is close to the free trade output
level.

In addition, even if revenues of the tariff were returned to the firm
as a lump sum transfer, the foreign firm would prefer a VER to a tariff.

This is due to the equilibrium profits of the foreign firm with the VER
being greater that its profits if the domestic firm randomized between

Notice, however, that as a VER causes both firms' profits to rise,

arises if the market for the

domestic product is more distorted that that for the foreign product and

In this event the loss in welfare

due to the decrease in imports and increase in foreign profits qd be

more than compensated for by

the increase in domestic output.

if domestic output fell due to a VER,

Of course,

welfare would have to fall as well.

A fall in domestic output is sufficient,

but not necessary for the national

welfare to fall due to a VER. Another sufficient condition for national
welfare to fall due to a VER is that world welfare fall when both prices
rise.

17

Although

the intuition for VER's to be

welfare decreasing is clear, a

formal argument is useful. This is provided next.
Theorem 5:

If both firms' profits rise due to a VER,
and world welfare
decreases when both prices
increase, national welfare must fall. Domestic

output must rise due to the VER for it

to be possible that national welfare

also rises.

and foreign profits only rose slightly.

Another argument made in favor of VER's is that they create employment
(or prevent unemployment which is desirable in. itself. However, my

analysis shows that employment may fall due to a VER.
A third argument made in favor of VER's is a more sophisticated one.
It adapts the old infant industry arguments to a mature economy. The
argument is that a mature economy subjected

to unexpected shocks (like the

oil—crisis) needs time to adapt its products (cars) and increase the
competitiveness of its products relative to (Japanese) imports. VER's are

a temporary measure to buy that time. However, VER's raise domestic
profits, which is likely to make unions more aggressive in their demands,

which would make it harder for domestic products to compete effectively in
the future.

14

An import equivalent export tax imposed by the exporting nation would

not have the severe anti—competitive effects

associated with a VER. In

addition, prices and foreign profits would be lower.

However, it is clear

19

from an examination of history that

trade restrictions tend to be self—

Perpetuating. For this reason, it is essential to link any restriction
to
increases in the efficiency of
domestic producers so that the restrictions
would ultimately be removed. It is in the interest of domestic
producers
to lobby for quantitatj restraints over tax policies which
are import
equivalent, because of the anti—competitive
nature of the former. For this
reason, such proposals should be viewed

6. Conclusj
Voluntary export restrictions have

been increasingly used lately as

substitutes for more direct trade controls like tariffs or quotas.

The

presumptiOU however, has been that:
(1) Political or legal considerations

dictate that tariffs cannot be

used to restrict trade.

(2) VER's are both politically and legally feasible.
(3) Although far from being a first best solution they are in the
national interest.

The analysis of this paper shows that

the imposition of a VER in a

duopolistic market, raises the profits of both the domestic and the foreign
the
firm. They do so because of their adverse effect on competition in

market. This makes it quite unlikely

for VER's to be in the national

interest. The analysis shows that the fo of the restriction is crucial
in oligopolistiC industries, as it affects the nature of strategic

interaction between firms. As trade restrictions in oligopoliStic
industries may have unexpected effects,
