Dynamic Behavior of Capital
Accumulation in a
Cash—in—Advance Model

ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes the dynamic behavior of capital accumulation

in Stockman's (1981) cash—in-advance model. If the cash—in—advance
constraint applies only to consuittion, then money is superneutral along

the transition path as well as in the long run. Alternatively, if the
cash—in—advance constraint applies to gross investnnt as well as
consumption, then a permanent increase in the rate of monetary growth

reduces the steady state capital stock. The effect on the speed of
adjustment depends on the sign of a certain simple function of the
parameters of preferences and technology.

In

of

an interesting recent paper, Stockman

(1981) develops a model

an economy with capital and with a cash—in—advance constraint. His

model produces the surprising result that if the cash—in—advance
constraint applies to gross investment as well as consumption, then
a permanent increase in the rate of monetary growth leads to a decrease
in the steady state capital stock; if the cash—in—advance constraint applies

only to consumption, then money is superneutral in the long run. It
was left as "an open question whether (and how) the rate of monetary

eansion affects the speed at which the economy approaches the steady
state" (p. 391).
The ci.rrent paper addresses the question of the effect of monetary

growth on the adjustment speed and

demonstrates

that if the cash-in—advance

constraint applies only to consumption, then money is superneutral along
the transition path as well as in the long run.

Alternatively,

if the

cash—in—advance constraint applies to gross investment as well as consumption,
then the direction of the effect of increased monetary growth on the
speed of adjustment depends on the sign of a certain simple function of the

parameters

of preferences and technology. For example, with an isoelastic

utility function and a Cobb-Douglas production function, higher monetary

Section III analyzes the dynamic behavior of an economy with a cash-in—advance

constraint for investment as well as consumption. We demonstrate that the
unique stable root of the linearized economy is positive so that the approach

to the steady state is monotonic. In section IV we show that an increase
in the rate of monetary growth leads to a faster speed of adjustment if and
only if a certain siiple function of the pararrters of preferences and

technology is positive. Concluding remarks are presented in section V.

we briefly examine the steady state in the general case.

Observe from (8) and (9) that the cash—in—advance economy achieves the
Modified Golden Rule if

either i=O or c=3. If

1i=O, cash is not required

to purchase capital and hence the cost of capital investment is unaffected
by changes in the rate of

inflation. Thus, as shown by

Stockman (1981),

money is superneutral in the long—run. Alternatively, if cash is required
for investment (p=l), then the cash—in—advance economy achieves the Modified

Golden Rule if

As mentioned above, if c1=, the shadow price of the

cash—in—advance constraint is zero. Therefore, the cost of capital investment
which requires cash-in-advance is unaffected by changes in the rate of
inflation so that the economy achieves the Modified Golden Rule. Note. that

the optimal rate of monetary growth., Y=, s, the same as. in:

(a) Brock's (1975)

model without capital; (b) the Sidrauski (1967) model with capital (as
pointed out by Dornbusch and Frenkel (1973)); and (c) overlapping generations
models with neoclassical production functions as pointed out by Abel (l984a).

binding. Nevertheless, equation (13) would continue to hold if the
nominal rate of unetary growth is constant over time. In addition, the
first—order conditions (6a—c) do not depend on whether

can be used

to

purchase consuntion goods in period t. Hence, the dynamic behavior of
the economy is invariant to whether or not Tt can be used in period t.

—9--

Substituting (15) into (14) yields a third—order difference equation in Kt
which is independent of the (constant) rate of monetary growth c.

Thus

provided that the cash-in-advance constraint (3) is binding, money is

serneutral

along the

transition path as well as in the long run.

It is worth noting that, as in the Fischer (1979)

analyses

and Asako (1983)

of the Sidrauski (1967) model, the analysis of the effect of a

change in monetary growth is interesting only if the economy is not

initially in the steady state.1 The reason is that since the economy
displays long-run superneutrality, the steady state is invariant to the

capital stock. Thus, if the cash—in-advance economy is initially in the
steady state, a permanent increase in the rate of monetary growth will
cause an equal immediate and peri1anent increase in the rate of inflation
and will have no effect on the capital stock, consumption or real balances.
We

have shown that (a) the economy with a cash—in—advance constraint

only for consumption attains the Modified Golden Rule which is the same
steady state attained by the corresponding non—monetary economy with an

infinitely-lived representative consumer. (As mentioned before, Stockman (1981)
showed this result); (b) the dynamic behavior of the economy is independent
of the (constant) rate of monetary growth, if the cash—in—advance constraint

is binding. Note that (a) and (b) do not iirly that dynamic behavior of
the cash—in—advance economy is the same as in the corresponding non—monetary
economy.5 Indeed, in the corresponding non—monetary economy, a consumer would

be purchased with cash. The analysis in the text assumes ij=l. If l?<l,
superneutrality continues to hold in the steady state, but not, in
general, along the transition path. See Abel (1984b) for further
discussion using a model which, at a formal level, is similar to the
then

model

with a cash—in—advance constraint for consumption

It follows immediately from (25a) and (25b) that h(Z) = 0 has at least

one real root between 0 and 1. From Descartes Rules of Signs, the fact
that there are two changes of sign in the coefficients of h(Z) = 0

indicates that there are either zero or two positive real roots. Since
we have located one real root between 0 and 1, these must be two positive

real roots. Furthermore, the other real root must be greater than 1.
Finally, the remaining root is real and

negative.

It follows immediately

from (25a,c) that the negative root is not between -1 and

0.

Therefore,

the negative root is less than -1.

We have now demonstrated that only one of the three characteristic

roots has modulus less than one. Furtherure, this stable root is
positive so that the capital stock approaches its steady state monotonically.
If the capital

stock Kt

is below the steady state capital stock,

the monotonic approach to the steady state inlies that Kt+i > Kt

In this section we examine the effect of a permanent change in
monetary growth on the speed of adjustment with a binding cash-in—advance

constraint on consuition and investment. In order to make the

analysis

more tractable we restrict the preferences and technology of our model
economy.

Concluding Remarks

The analysis in this paper has examined the dynamic behavior along

the (linearized) transition path in Stockman's (1981) cash-in-advance
model as Fischer (1979) and Asako (1983) have analyzed the (linearized)

transition path in the Sidrauski (1967) model, In particular, these
analyses of the transition path have focussed on the effect of a permanent
increase

in monetary growth, on the speed of adjustment of the economy.

We have presented some general results for the cash—in—advance model which

may

be compared with the results for the Sidrauski model, For example, if the

cash—in—advance constraint applies to investment as well as consumption, and if

capital

does not depreciate, then an increase in monetary growth increases

the adjustment speed of economy; except for the logarithmic case (in which
the speed of adjustment is invariant to the rate of monetary growth),

Fischer (1979) also found
adjustment

that higher

monetary growth

leads

to faster

in the Sidrauski model. Alternatively, we showed that if capital

depreciates completely after one period in the cash—in—advance model, then higher
monetary growth

leads to faster (slower) (the same) speed of adjustment if

the elasticity of marginal utility is less than (greater than) (equal) to

one; these findings are qualitatively the same

as

in Asako's (1983) formulation

of the Sidrauski model in which money and consumption are perfect complements
in the utility function.

The similarity of results between some specifications of the cash—in—
advance

model and some specifications of the Sidrauski model is superficial

and may mask an important underlying difference. The results derived by
Fischer and Asako

for

the Sidrauski model do not depend on the specification

of technology, except for the usual concavity assumptions. Although these

studies explicitly assume zero depreciation, the production function in these

—20—

papers, f(Kt)i could

be interpreted

as f(K) =

f(Kt)

.SKt where f

is gross output. However, the results for the cash—in—advance model

depend crucially on the specification of technology. The budget
constraint (2) relates net investment Kt÷l

Kt to net output f(K) —

(and other variables), whereas the cash—in—advance constraint (4) relates
net investment to depreciation 5Kt (and other variables). Because the
capital stock enters two constraints in different forms (f(Kt) -

SK). it is no longer sufficient simply to specify the net production
function without specifying the gross production function and depreciation

separately. As we have emphasized, the effect on the adjustment speed of a
change in the monetary
the

growth rate can differ dramatically depending on

rate of depreciation.
