The Agglomeration of US Ethnic Inventors
William Kerr
NBER Working Paper No. 15501
November 2009
JEL No. F15,F22,J44,J61,O31
ABSTRACT
The ethnic composition of US inventors is undergoing a significant transformation, with deep impacts
for the overall agglomeration of US innovation. This study applies an ethnic-name database to individual
US patent records to explore these trends with greater detail. The contributions of Chinese and Indian
scientists and engineers to US technology formation increase dramatically in the 1990s. At the same
time, these ethnic inventors became more spatially concentrated across US cities. The combination
of these two factors helps stop and reverse long-term declines in overall inventor agglomeration evident
in the 1970s and 1980s. The heightened ethnic agglomeration is particularly evident in industry patents
for high-tech sectors, and similar trends are not found in institutions constrained from agglomerating
(e.g., universities, government).

Introduction

Economists have long been interested in agglomeration and innovation. In his seminal outline of
the core rationales for industrial clusters, Marshall (1920) emphasized the theory of intellectual
spillovers by arguing that in agglomerations, "the mysteries of the trade become no mystery,
but are, as it were, in the air." Workers can learn skills quickly from each other in an industrial
cluster, and this proximity can speed the adoption of new technologies or best practices. Glaeser
and Kahn (2001) argue that the urbanization of high human-capital industries, like …nance, is
evidence for the role that density plays in the transfer of ideas, and studies of patent citations
highlight the importance of local proximity for scienti…c exchanges (e.g., Ja¤e et al. 1992,
Thompson and Fox-Kean 2006). Moreover, evidence suggests that agglomeration increases the
rate of innovation itself. Saxenian (1994) describes how entrepreneurial …rms locate near one
another in Silicon Valley to foster new technology development. Carlino et al. (2006) show that
higher urban employment density is correlated with greater patenting per capita within cities.
Strong quantitative assessments of the magnitudes and characteristics of intellectual spillovers
and agglomeration are essential. Such studies inform business managers of the advantages and
costs for locating in areas that are rich in ideas but most likely come with higher rents and
wages as well. Moreover, these studies are important for understanding short-run and long-run
urban growth and development. They help inform whether industrial specialization or diversity
better foster regional development (e.g., Jacobs 1970, Glaeser et al. 1992, Henderson et al.
1995, Duranton and Puga 2001, Duranton 2007) and the role of local knowledge development
and externalities in generating sustained growth (e.g., Romer 1986, 1990, Furman et al. 2002).
Rosenthal and Strange (2003) note that intellectual spillovers are strongest at the very local
levels of proximity.1
This study contributes to our empirical understanding of agglomeration and innovation by
documenting patterns in the city-level agglomeration of ethnic inventors (e.g., Chinese, Indian)
within the US from 1975 through 2007. The contributions of these immigrant groups to US
technology formation are staggering: while foreign-born account for just over 10% of the US
working population, they represent 25% of the US science and engineering (SE) workforce and
nearly 50% of those with doctorates. Even looking within the Ph.D. level, ethnic researchers
make exceptional contributions to science as measured by Nobel Prizes, elections to the National
Academy of Sciences, patent citation counts, and so on.2 Recent work relates immigration and
growth in US invention (e.g., Peri 2007, Hunt 2008, Kerr and Lincoln 2008). Moreover, ethnic

Several studies assess the relative importance of intellectual spillovers versus other rationales for industrial
agglomeration (e.g., lower transportation costs, labor market pooling). Representative papers include Audretsch
and Feldman (1996), Rosenthal and Strange (2001), Henderson (2003), Ellison et al. (2007), and Glaeser and
Kerr (2008). Porter (1990) emphasizes how vertically related industries may co-locate for knowledge sharing.

entrepreneurs are very active in commercializing new technologies, especially in high-tech sectors
(e.g., Saxenian 2002a, Wadhwa et al. 2007).
The spatial distribution of ethnic inventors across US cities, however, is not uniform or
random. This agglomeration re‡ects the general tendency of both high-skilled and low-skilled
immigrants to concentrate in certain US cities. Larger cities are often favored for their greater
opportunities for assimilation. Geographical distances of cities to home countries and past
immigration networks are also important for location decisions. Edin et al. (2003) and Pedace
and Rohn (2008) provide recent evidence on the employment e¤ects of enclaves at both the
city and sub-city levels. A number of studies in labor economics use spatial di¤erences across
cities and occupations in immigrant shares to estimate the impact of higher immigration rates
on native workers (e.g., Card 1990, 2001).3
The study of how US ethnic inventors agglomerate is thus very important given 1) the disproportionate contributions of immigrant researchers and 2) their non-random spatial distribution
across the US. Such a characterization is necessary for understanding the geography of US innovation and economic growth. Moreover, the spatial variation of immigrant researchers across
cities allows for stronger quantitative assessments of the role of innovation in city growth. This
paper is a …rst step in this direction.
Econometric studies quantifying the role of ethnic scientists and engineers for technology
formation and di¤usion are often hampered, however, by data constraints. It is very di¢ cult
to assemble su¢ cient cross-sectional and longitudinal variation for large-scale panel exercises.4
This paper describes a new approach for quantifying the ethnic composition of US inventors
with previously unavailable detail. The technique exploits the inventor names contained on
the micro-records for all patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark O¢ ce
(USPTO) from January 1975 to May 2008.5 Each patent record lists one or more inventors,
with 8 million inventor names associated with the 4.5 million patents. The USPTO grants
patents to inventors living within and outside of the US, with each group accounting for about
half of patents over the 1975-2008 period.
This study maps into these inventor names an ethnic-name database typically used for commercial applications. This approach exploits the idea that inventors with the surnames Chang
or Wang are likely of Chinese ethnicity, those with surnames Rodriguez or Martinez of Hispanic
3

General surveys of immigration include Borjas (1994), Friedberg and Hunt (1995), Freeman (2006), and Kerr
and Kerr (2008).

While the decennial Census provides detailed cross-sectional descriptions, its longitudinal variation is necessarily limited. The annual Current Population Survey, however, provides poor cross-sectional detail and does not
ask immigrant status until 1994. The SESTAT database o¤ers a better trade-o¤ between the two dimensions,
but su¤ers important sampling biases with respect to immigrants (Kannankutty and Wilkinson 1999).
5
The project initially employed the NBER Patent Data File, compiled by Hall et al. (2001), that includes
patents granted by the USPTO from January 1975 to December 1999. The current version now employs an
extended version developed by HBS Research that includes patents granted through May 2008.

ethnicity, and so on. The match rates are 92%-98% for US domestic inventor records, depending upon the procedure employed, and the process a¤ords the distinction of nine ethnicities:
Chinese, English, European, Hispanic/Filipino, Indian/Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and
Vietnamese. Moreover, because the matching is done at the micro-level, greater detail on the
ethnic composition of inventors is available annually on multiple dimensions: technologies, cities,
companies, and so on. Section 2 describes this data development in greater detail.
Section 3 then documents the growing contribution of ethnic inventors to US technology
formation. The rapid increase during the 1990s in the share of high-tech patents granted to
Chinese and Indian inventors is particularly striking. This section also uses the patenting data to
calculate concentration indices for US innovation. Ethnic inventors have higher levels of spatial
concentration than English inventors throughout the thirty-year period studied. Moreover, the
spatial concentration of ethnic inventors increases signi…cantly from 1995 to 2004, especially in
high-tech sectors like computer-related patenting. The combination of greater ethnic shares
and increasing agglomeration of ethnic inventors helps stop and reverse the 1975-1994 declines
in the overall concentration of US invention. These trends are con…ned to industrial patents;
universities and government bodies — that are constrained from agglomerating — do not show
recent increases in spatial clustering.
The …nal section concludes. The higher agglomeration of immigrants in cities and occupations has long been noted. For example, Mandor¤ (2007) highlights how immigrant entrepreneurs tend to agglomerate in selected industries, a process that increases their business
impact for speci…c sectors. Examples within the US are Korean entrepreneurs in dry cleaning,
Vietnamese in nail salons, Gujarati Indians in traveler accommodations, Punjabi Indians in gas
stations, Greeks in restaurants, and so on. The higher natural social interactions among these
ethnic groups aid in the acquisition and transfer of sector-speci…c skills; scale economies lead to
occupational clustering by minority ethnic groups.
To date, there has been very little work, theoretically or empirically, on the agglomeration
of US ethnic scientists and engineers with the notable exception of Agrawal et al. (2007).6
This scarcity of research is disappointing given the scale of these ethnic contributions and the
importance of innovation to regional economic growth. Moreover, the large shifts in ethnic
inventor populations, often driven in part by US immigration restrictions, may provide empirical
footholds for testing agglomeration theories in a natural experiment framework. It is hoped that
the empirical platform developed in this study provides a foothold for furthering such analyses.
6
Agrawal et al. (2007) jointly examine knowledge di¤usion through co-location and co-ethnicity using domestic
patent citations made by Indian inventors living in the US. While being in the same city or the same ethnicity
both encourage knowledge di¤usion, their estimations suggest that the marginal bene…t of co-location is four
times larger for inventors of di¤erent ethnicities. This substitutability between social and geographic proximity
can create di¤erences between a social planner’s optimal distribution of ethnic members and what the inventors
themselves would choose.

Ethnic-Name Matching Technique

This section describes the ethnic-name matching strategy, outlines the strengths and weaknesses
of the name database selected, and o¤ers some validation exercises using patent records …led by
foreign inventors with the USPTO. Kerr (2007) further describes the name-matching process,
the international name distribution technique, and the apportionment of non-unique matches
that are highlighted below.

2.1

Melissa Ethnic-Name Database and Name-Matching Technique

The ethnic-name database employed in this study was originally developed by the Melissa Data
Corporation for use in direct-mail advertisements. Ethnic-name databases su¤er from two inherent limitations — not all ethnicities are covered and included ethnicities usually receive unequal
treatment. The strength of the Melissa database is in the identi…cation of Asian ethnicities,
especially Chinese, Indian/Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Vietnamese names. The
database is comparatively weaker for looking within continental Europe. For example, Dutch
surnames are collected without …rst names, while the opposite is true for French names. The
Asian comparative advantage and overall cost e¤ectiveness led to the selection of the Melissa
database, as well as the European amalgamation employed in the matching technique. In total,
nine ethnicities are distinguished: Chinese, English, European, Hispanic/Filipino, Indian/Hindi,
Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Vietnamese.7
The second limitation is that commercial databases vary in the number of names they contain
for each ethnicity. These di¤erences re‡ect both uneven coverage and that some ethnicities are
more homogeneous in their naming conventions. For example, the 1975 to 1999 Her…ndahl
indices of foreign inventor surnames for Korean (0.047) and Vietnamese (0.112) are signi…cantly
higher than Japanese (0.013) and English (0.016) due to frequent Korean surnames like Kim
(16%) and Park (12%) and Vietnamese surnames like Nguyen (29%) and Tran (12%).
Two polar matching strategies are employed to ensure coverage di¤erences do not overly
in‡uence ethnicity assignments.
Full Matching: This procedure utilizes all of the name assignments in the Melissa
database and manually codes any unmatched surname or …rst name associated with
100 or more inventor records. This technique further exploits the international
distribution of inventor names within the patent database to provide superior results.
7
The largest ethnicity in the US SE workforce absent from the ethnic-name database is Iranian, which accounted for 0.7% of bachelor-level SEs in the 1990 Census.

4

The match rate for this restricted procedure is 98% (98% US, 98% foreign). This
rate should be less than 100% with the Melissa database as not all ethnicities are
included.
Restricted Matching: A second strategy employs a uniform name database using
only the 3000 and 200 most common surnames and …rst names, respectively, for each
ethnicity. These numerical bars are the lowest common denominators across the
major ethnicities studied. The match rate for this restricted procedure is 89% (92%
US, 86% foreign).
For matching, names in both the patent and ethnic-name databases are capitalized and truncated
to ten characters. Approximately 88% of the patent name records have a unique surname, …rst
name, or middle name match in the Full Matching procedure (77% in the Restricted Matching),
a¤ording a single ethnicity determination with priority given to surname matches. For inventors
residing in the US, representative probabilities are assigned to non-unique matches using the
masters-level SE communities in Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). Ethnic probabilities
for the remaining 3% of records (mostly foreign) are calculated as equal shares.

2.2

Inventors Residing in Foreign Countries and Regions

Visual con…rmation of the top 1000 surnames and …rst names in the USPTO records con…rms the
name-matching technique works well. The appendix documents the 100 most common surnames
of US-based inventors for each ethnicity, along with their relative contributions. These counts
sum the ethnic contribution from inventors with each surname. These counts include partial
or split assignments. Moreover, they are not necessarily direct or exclusive matches (e.g., the
ethnic match may have occurred through the …rst name). While some inventors are certainly
misclassi…ed, the measurement error in aggregate trends building from the micro-data is minor.
The Full Matching procedure is the preferred technique and underlies the trends presented in
the next section, but most applications …nd negligible di¤erences when the Restricted Matching
dataset is employed instead.
The application of the ethnic-name database to the inventors residing outside of the US
provides a natural quality-assurance exercise for the technique. Inventions originating outside
the US account for just under half of USPTO patents, with applications from Japan comprising
about half of this foreign total. The appendix documents the results of applying the ethnicmatching procedures for countries and regions grouped to the ethnicities identi…able with the
database. The results are very encouraging. First, the Full Matching procedure assigns
ethnicities to a large percentage of foreign records, with the match rates greater than 93% for
5

all countries. In the Restricted Matching procedure, a matching rate of greater than 74% holds
for all regions.
Second, the estimated inventor compositions are reasonable. The own-ethnicity shares are
summarized in the fourth and …fth columns. The weighted average is 86% in the Full Matching
procedure, and own-ethnicity contributions are greater than 80% in the UK, China, India, Japan,
Korea, and Russia regardless of the matching procedure employed. Like the US, own-ethnicity
contributions should be less than 100% due to foreign researchers. The high success rate
using the Restricted Matching procedure indicates that the ethnic-name database performs well
without exploiting the international distribution of names, although power is lost with Europe.
Likewise, uneven coverage in the Melissa database is not driving the ethnic composition trends.

2.3

Advantages and Disadvantages of Name-Matching Technique

The matched records describe the ethnic composition of US scientists and engineers with previously unavailable detail: incorporating the major ethnicities working in the US SE community;
separating out detailed technologies and manufacturing industries; providing city-level statistics;
and providing annual metrics. Moreover, the assignment of patents to corporations and institutions a¤ords …rm-level and university-level characterizations that are not otherwise possible
(e.g., the ethnic composition of IBM’s inventors …ling computer patents from San Francisco in
1985). The next section studies the agglomeration of invention along these various dimensions.8
The ethnic-name procedure does, however, have two potential limitations for empirical work
on agglomeration that should be highlighted. First, the approach does not distinguish foreignborn ethnic researchers in the US from later generations working as SEs. The procedure can
only estimate total ethnic SE populations, and concentration levels are to some extent measured
with time-invariant error due to the name-matching approach. The resulting data are very
powerful, however, for panel econometrics that employ changes in these ethnic SE populations
for identi…cation. Moreover, Census and INS records con…rm Asian changes are primarily due
to new SE immigration for this period, substantially weakening this concern when examining
these groups.
The name-matching technique also does not distinguish …ner divisions within the nine major
ethnic groupings. For some analyses (e.g., network ties), it would be advantageous to separate
Mexican from Chilean scientists within the Hispanic ethnicity, to distinguish Chinese engineers
with ethnic ties to Taipei versus Beijing versus Shanghai, and so on. These distinctions are not
possible with the Melissa database, and researchers should understand that measurement error

Sample applications are Kerr (2008a,b), Kerr and Lincoln (2008), and Foley and Kerr (2008).

from the broader ethnic divisions may bias their estimated coe¢ cients downward depending
upon the application. Nevertheless, the upcoming sections demonstrate how the deep variation
available with the ethnic patenting data provides a rich description of US ethnic invention.

3

The Agglomeration of US Ethnic Invention

This section starts by describing the broad trends in ethnic contributions to US technology
formation. The spatial concentration of ethnic invention is then closely analyzed, including
variations by technology categories and institutions.

3.1

Ethnic Composition of US Inventors

Table 1 describes the ethnic composition of US inventors for 1975-2004, with granted patents
grouped by application years. The trends demonstrate a growing ethnic contribution to US
technology development, especially among Chinese and Indian scientists. Ethnic inventors are
more concentrated in high-tech industries like computers and pharmaceuticals and in gateway
cities relatively closer to their home countries (e.g., Chinese in San Francisco, Europeans in New
York, and Hispanics in Miami). The …nal three rows demonstrate a close correspondence of
the estimated ethnic composition to the country-of-birth composition of the US SE workforce in
the 1990 Census. The estimated European contribution in Table 1 is naturally higher than the
immigrant contribution measured by foreign born.
Figure 1 illustrates the evolving ethnic composition of US inventors from 1975-2004. The
omitted English share declines from 83% to 70% during this period. Looking across all technology categories, the European ethnicity is initially the largest foreign contributor to US technology
development. Like the English ethnicity, however, the European share of US domestic inventors
declines steadily from 8% in 1975 to 6% in 2004. This declining share is partly due to the
exceptional growth over the thirty years of the Chinese and Indian ethnicities, which increase
from under 2% to 8% and 5%, respectively. As shown below, this Chinese and Indian growth is
concentrated in high-tech sectors, where Chinese inventors supplant European researchers as the
largest ethnic contributor to US technology formation. The Indian ethnic contribution declines
somewhat after 2000.9
Among the other ethnicities, the Hispanic contribution grows from 3% to 4% from 1975 to
2004. The level of this series is likely mismeasured due to the extensive overlap of Hispanic and
9
This decline is mostly due to changes within the computer technology sector as seen below. Recent applications to the USPTO suggest the Indian trend may not have declined as much as the granted patents through early
2008 portray. Kerr and Lincoln (2008) investigate the role of H-1B visa reforms for explaining these patterns.

7

European names, but the positive growth is consistent with stronger Latino and Filipino scienti…c
contributions in Florida, Texas, and California. The Korean share increases dramatically from
0.3% to 1.1% over the thirty years, while the Russian climbs from 1.2% to 2.2%. Although
di¢ cult to see with Figure 1’s scaling, much of the Russian increase occurs in the 1990s following
the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The Japanese share steadily increases from 0.6% to 1.0%.
Finally, while the Vietnamese contribution is the lowest throughout the sample, it does exhibit
the strongest relative growth from 0.1% to 0.6%.
The 1975-2004 statistics employ patents granted by the USPTO through May 2008. Due
to the long and uneven USPTO review process, statistics are grouped by application year to
construct the most accurate indicators of when inventive activity occurs. The unfortunate
consequence of using application years, however, is substantial attrition in years immediately
before 2008. As many patents are in the review process but have yet to be granted, the granted
patent series is truncated at the 2004 application year. The USPTO began publishing patent
applications in 2001. These applications data also show comparable ethnic contributions.

3.2

Spatial Locations of US Ethnic Inventors

Table 2 examines the 1975-2004 ethnic inventor contributions by major MSAs. A total of
283 MSAs are identi…ed from inventors’city names using city lists collected from the O¢ ce of
Social and Economic Data Analysis at the University of Missouri, with a matching rate of 99%.
Manual coding further ensures all patents with more than 100 citations and all city names with
more than 100 patents are identi…ed. The …rst four columns document each MSA’s share of US
patenting. Not surprisingly, these shares are highly correlated with MSA size, with the three
largest patenting centers for 1995-2004 found in San Francisco (12%), New York (7%), and Los
Angeles (6%), where the percentages indicate US domestic patent shares.
Comparing these total patenting percentages with the ethnic patenting shares, listed in the
second set of four columns, reveals the more interesting fact that ethnic patenting is more
concentrated than general innovation. The 1995-2004 ethnic patent shares of San Francisco,
New York, and Los Angeles are 19%, 10%, and 8%, respectively. Similarly, 81% of ethnic
research occurs in the major MSAs listed in Table 2, compared to 73% of total patenting.
The …nal three columns list the Chinese and Indian patenting share by MSA, highlighting the
exceptional growth of San Francisco from 8% of 1975-1984 patenting to 25% in 1995-2004. These
concentration levels and trends are further examined below.10
10

Each of these trends appears to have strengthened in the recent applications data (i.e., the columns marked
with A in Table 2). While suggestive, these statistics should be treated with caution. Some technology …elds
and …rm types are more likely to publish their patent applications than others. Likewise, probabilities of patent
grants conditional on application vary by …eld. Lemley and Sampat (2007) discuss these limitations further.

8

Table 3 presents simple least squares estimations of ethnic inventor locations and MSA characteristics. The variables of interest are MSA shares of US ethnic inventors during 1985-2004,
with column headers indicating ethnicities. These shares are calculated over the 244 MSAs for
which full covariate information are assembled. The dropped observations are small cities not
separately identi…ed in 1990 Census of Population. For ease of interpretation, variables are
transformed to have unit standard deviation in these cross-sectional estimations. Estimations
are weighted by MSA populations.
To establish a baseline, the …rst two columns consider MSA inventor shares of the English
ethnicity. In Column 1, MSA size and urban density strongly predict higher English inventor
shares. A one standard-deviation increase in the population share of the MSA correlates with
a 0.57 standard-deviation increase in the share of English ethnic invention. Coastal access does
not predict greater inventor concentration in multi-variate frameworks, although a univariate
correlation exists. On the other hand, MSA demographics have a statistically and economically
signi…cant relationship with inventor concentrations. The MSA traits are calculated from the
1990 Census of Population. MSAs with more-educated workforces are associated with greater
inventor concentrations. Higher shares of English invention are also found in MSAs with relatively more people between the ages of 30 and 60 (the omitted group) and more men. All told,
this parsimonious set of covariates explains 84% of the variation in English invention shares.
Table 2 suggests that inventor shares are relatively persistent over time for MSAs. Column 2
of Table 3 con…rms this observation for English inventors. The estimation incorporates the share
of English ethnic patenting in the MSA for 1975-1984. This ten-year period pre-dates the major
growth in ethnic inventors highlighted in Figure 1. The spatial distribution of English invention
over 1975-1984 is a very strong predictor for 1985-2004 concentration with an elasticity of 0.84.
MSA populations and density levels do not exhibit a well-measured relationship with 19852004 English inventor concentrations after controlling for these past levels. Partial correlations
with MSA demographics, however, are more robust. Incorporating the past concentration lag
explains 88% of the MSA-level variation in inventor shares (83% by itself).11
The subsequent eight columns of Table 3 consider major non-English inventor shares. The
estimation framework remains the same excepting the 1975-1984 MSA inventor shares in the
even-numbered columns that are adjusted to match the dependent variable. Most explanatory variables (e.g., MSA demographics) demonstrate similar elasticities across ethnic groups.
Coastal access tends to be more important, although of borderline statistical signi…cance. This
re‡ects the well-known tendency for immigrants to locate in port cities closer to their home
countries.
11

Unreported speci…cations further incorporate mean wages in manufacturing, mean family income levels,
and mean housing prices by MSA. Positive correlations between inventor shares and manufacturing wages are
generally found; family income levels and housing prices do not exhibit robust relationships in multi-variate
settings. The inclusion of these three covariates has very limited in‡uence on the reported outcomes.

9

Several interesting di¤erences, however, emerge. First, the overall explanatory power of these
regressors varies across ethnic groups. The R2 values for the Chinese and Indian ethnicities are
substantially lower than those for the European and Hispanic ethnicities. These Asian ethnicities
thus have more idiosyncratic spatial patterns than this limited set of covariates modelled. This is
con…rmed when the even-numbered columns incorporate the lagged ethnic inventor shares. The
gain in the variation explained through past MSA-speci…c placements is strongest for Chinese
and Indian inventors. This strength suggests that lagged spatial patterns for Asian inventors
may o¤er an empirical foothold for predicting future MSA-level innovation even conditional on
other MSA-level traits.
These even-numbered columns also show that lagged ethnic inventor shares tend to have
weaker predictive power for subsequent MSA-level concentration compared to the English ethnicity in Column 2. The elasticities range from 0.87 for Chinese patents to 0.53 for Hispanic
patents (which is lowest among the nine ethnic inventor groups). This lower explanatory power
has at least two explanations. First, spatial distributions for ethnic inventors over 1975-1984
may have greater measurement error than English inventor distributions due to smaller counts
of relevant patents. Such measurement error would downward bias estimated elasticities.
Nonetheless, it is also true that ethnic inventors facilitate shifts in invention locations across
US MSAs. For example, immigrant SE students graduating from elite US universities enter a
national labor market. Hispanic inventors have supported broader growth in Florida and the
southwestern states. While past immigration cities are favored, ethnic inventors also have an
inherent capacity to facilitate regional adjustments. Unreported estimations further test this
conclusion by controlling simultaneously for each MSA’s 1975-1984 English inventor share and
ethnic-speci…c inventor share. With the exception of the European and Russian ethnicities,
lagged ethnic spatial distributions have stronger predictive power for subsequent agglomeration
than lagged English spatial distributions.
Table 4 repeats the estimations without the MSA population weights. The measured partial
correlations decline in magnitude somewhat, re‡ective of the greater attention paid to smaller
MSA shares, but the patterns of coe¢ cients and explanatory power are comparable to the
weighted outcomes. Several additional speci…cation checks are also undertaken. Incorporating
regional …xed e¤ects …nds anticipated spatial patterns — Midwestern US MSAs tend to have
higher invention rates conditional on the covariates modelled, while southern MSAs have lower
rates. The east and west coasts are often not statistically distinguishable from each other
conditionally. Performing the share estimations on an annual basis, which circumvents growth in
recent patent application rates, yields similar outcomes to the cross-sectional results. Likewise,
log speci…cations produce outcomes similar to the share speci…cation framework.
Finally, the appendix documents speci…cations that model lagged ethnic population shares
10

across MSAs as the historical regressor rather than the distribution of lagged ethnic patenting.
These shares are calculated over working-age populations for 203 cities through the 1980 Census
of Population by country of birth. In general, the spatial distribution of lagged ethnic patenting in Tables 3 and 4 is a stronger predictor than general ethnic population distributions; R2
values also decline. The one exception is for the Chinese ethnicity, where the general Chinese
population distribution is an exceptionally strong predictor of recent patenting. These patterns
also hold when jointly modelling the lagged regressors together.
These comparisons are interesting in that they begin to quantify the relative roles of production versus consumption bene…ts for the agglomeration of ethnic inventors. The productive
bene…ts of being near other inventors of one’s ethnicity appear stronger that the general consumption bene…ts of being in ethnic enclaves, but the latter are surprisingly strong. To address
properly this issue, future work hopes to examine the sub-city level to the extent possible with
the patenting data. The high correlation between lagged Chinese inventor and population distributions depends, for example, on the decision to model the San Francisco Bay area as a single
MSA. Splitting San Jose and Silicon Valley from San Francisco and/or Oakland would reduce
the correlation. Undertaking such an analysis would be informative for the speci…c question of
location decisions by ethnic inventors; it would also contribute to recent work on ethnic enclaves
at the sub-city level (e.g., Pedace and Rohn 2008).
Of course, these estimations must be interpreted as partial correlations rather than causal
assessments. Clearly, ethnic inventors directly in‡uence many of the determinants modelled
(e.g., education shares) and may also have local spillover e¤ects through their work (e.g., local
technology gains that generate city population growth). Omitted factors may also be correlated
with past immigrant placements. Future work hopes to further re…ne these determinants in a
causal assessment.
Ongoing research is further evaluating how shifts in the geographic concentration of ethnic
inventors facilitate changes in the geographic composition of US innovation. Not only are ethnic
scientists disproportionately concentrated in major MSAs, but growth in a MSA’s share of ethnic
patenting is highly correlated with growth in its share of total US patenting. Annual regressions
across the full 1975-2004 MSA sample …nd that an increase of 1% in an MSA’s ethnic patenting
share correlates with a 0.6% increase in the MSA’s total invention share. This coe¢ cient is
remarkably high, as the mean ethnic share of total invention during this period is around 20%.
Of course, additional study is required before causal assessments are possible. The ethnic-name
approach will also need to be complemented with external data to distinguish ethnic inventor
shifts due to new immigration, domestic migration, or occupational changes.

3.3

Spatial Concentration of US Ethnic Inventors

To re…ne the earlier visual observations made regarding agglomeration levels in Table 2, Table
5 presents three concentration indices for US domestic patenting. The …rst concentration
P
2
metric studied is the Her…ndahl-Hirschman Index de…ned by HHIt = M
m=1 Sharemt , where M
indexes 283 MSAs and Sharemt is the share of patenting in MSA m in period t. Of course,
patenting is undertaken outside of MSAs, too. The share of patenting outside of these 283
MSAs declines from 9% in 1975-1984 to 7% in 1995-2004. In 2001-2006 applications, this share
further declines to 6%. This portion of US invention is excluded from the remainder of this
paper, with concentration metrics being calculated over MSA patenting only.
The top panel of Table 5 and Figure 2 highlight several important levels di¤erences. First,
US invention is more concentrated than the general population across these MSAs.12 Moreover,
ethnic inventors are substantially more agglomerated than English-ethnicity inventors throughout the thirty years considered. The mean population HHI is 0.024 over the period, compared
with 0.037 for invention and 0.059 for all non-English inventors. The agglomeration of Chinese
inventors further stands out at 0.081. This higher ethnic concentration certainly re‡ects the
well-known concentration of immigrant groups, but is not due to simply the smaller sizes of
some ethnicities. Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese are consistently the most agglomerated
of ethnic inventor groups. European and Hispanic inventors are the least concentrated, but all
ethnic groups are more agglomerated than the English ethnicity.13
Moving from the levels to the trends evident in Table 5 and Figure 2, the HHI for all US
inventors consistently declines from 1975-1979 to 1990-1994. This trend is reversed, however,
with greater levels of invention agglomeration in 1995-1999 and 2000-2004. This reversal towards greater patenting concentration is not re‡ected in the overall population shares. Ethnic
inventors, however, show a sharp increase in these latter ten years. This upturn is strongest
among Asian ethnic groups, with European and Hispanic inventors showing limited change in
agglomeration.
A second agglomeration metric is calculated as the share of total US patenting in the Top
5 MSAs for 1975-1984: New York City (12%), Los Angeles (7%), Chicago (6%), Philadelphia
(5%), and San Francisco (5%). Boston (4%) and Detroit (3%) have the next two largest shares
in 1975-1984. These …ve MSAs account for about 37% of MSA patenting during this initial
period and 34% of total US patenting that includes rural areas. The share accounted for by
12

MSA populations are calculated through county populations collected in 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, and 1997.
These are mid-points of the …ve-year increments studied. The 2000-2004 period uses the 1997 MSA population.
13
Calculations from the 1990 and 2000 Census of Populations …nd that the aggregate concentration of immigrant
SEs is slightly less than the agglomeration of all immigrants. Substantial di¤erences in immigrant shares are
evident in larger cities. New York City, Los Angeles, and Miami have larger overall immigration pools relative
to SE, while San Francisco, Washington, Boston, and Seattle have greater SE shares.

12

these …ve MSAs behaves similarly to the HHI metric, declining until 1990-1994 before growing
during 1995-2004. While less formal, this second technique highlights how ethnic agglomeration
shifts across the major US MSAs. By 1995-2004, San Francisco (12%) leads New York City
(7%) and Los Angeles (6%). Boston and Chicago would complete a new Top 5 MSAs list for
1995-2004.
Our …nal agglomeration metric is taken from Ellison and Glaeser (1997),
PM
xm )2
Agg
m=1 (sm;e
=

PM
e

m=1 xm

where M indexes MSAs. s1;e ; s2;e ; : : : ; sM;e are the shares of ethnicity e’s patenting contained
in each of these geographic areas. x1 ; x2 ; : : : ; xM are each area’s share of population.14 This
metric estimates the agglomeration of invention relative to the baseline established by the MSA
populations. If invention is randomly distributed among the population, the Ellison and Glaeser
metric will not show concentration. The bottom panel of Table 5 and Figure 3 report these
indices. When judged relative to the overall population’s distribution, the trends in the agglomeration of invention look a little di¤erent. The 1975-1994 periods are found to have fairly
consistent levels of concentration, with a strong upturn in the 1995-2004 years. This pattern is
predicted by the growing deviations with time in the HHI trends in Panel A.
Following Ellison et al. (2007), the pairwise coagglomeration of invention between ethnicity
e1 and e2 is analyzed with the simple formula
PM
xm )(sm;e2 xm )
Coagg
m=1 (sm;e1
:
PM
e1 ;e2 =
2
1
m=1 xm

This index measures the covariance of ethnic invention across MSAs, with the denominator
rescaling the covariance to eliminate a sensitivity to the …neness of the geographic breakdown.
The coagglomeration indices are contained in the appendix. Coagglomeration among nonEnglish ethnic inventors is substantially higher than between English inventors and these groups.
This is especially true among the Asian ethnicities. These coagglomeration measures rise in
recent years, behaving similarly to the agglomeration measures when relative to the total population.

3.4

Technology Concentration of US Ethnic Inventors

Figure 4 documents the total ethnic contribution by the six broad technology groups into which
patents are often classi…ed: Chemicals, Computers and Communications, Drugs and Medical,
14
The full Ellison and Glaeser (1997) formula also controls for the HHI index of plant size. This feature is
ignored in this examination of individual inventors. The ethnic patenting data do not easily support continuous
estimators like Duranton and Overman (2005), although future research hopes to approximate these metrics too.

13

Electrical and Electronic, Mechanical, and Miscellaneous/Others. The Miscellaneous group
includes patents for agriculture, textiles, furniture, and the like. Growth in ethnic patenting is
noticeably stronger in high-tech sectors than in more traditional industries. Figures 5 and 6
provide more detailed glimpses within the Chinese and Indian ethnicities, respectively. These
two ethnic groups are clearly important contributors to the stronger growth in ethnic contributions among high-tech sectors, where Chinese inventors supplant European researchers as the
largest ethnic contributor to US technology formation.15
One possible explanation for Table 5’s aggregate gains in concentration is compositional shifts
in the volume and nature of granted patents, rather than a shift in underlying innovation per
se. There has been a substantial increase in the number of patents granted by the USPTO
over the last two decades. While this increase is partly due to population growth and higher
levels of US innovation, institutional factors also play an important role.16 The heightened
agglomeration may be driven by greater patenting rates by certain technology groups, re‡ecting
either true changes in the underlying innovation rates or simply a greater propensity to seek
patent protection. The latter is especially relevant for the recent rise of software patents (e.g.,
Graham and Mowery 2004). Microsoft, Oracle, and other software companies are among the
US’s largest …rms today in terms of patent applications, but historically this industry did not
seek patent protection.
Table 6 considers the geographic concentration of invention that exists within each of the
six broad technology groupings. Panel A presents HHI measures calculated over all patents
within each technology. The exceptional rebounds for 1995-2004 are strongest within the Computers and Communications and Electrical and Electronic groupings. Drugs and Medical and
Mechanical categories also demonstrate weaker gains, while Chemicals and Miscellaneous show
steady trends for less spatial agglomeration throughout the 1975-2004 period.
The dual responses within the Computers and Communications and Electrical and Electronic
groupings suggest that the greater agglomeration is more of a high-tech phenomena than software
in particular. This conclusion is further con…rmed in the appendix. In these estimations,
agglomeration is calculated for each sub-category within the six broad technology divisions;
there are four to nine sub-categories within each division. In both weighted and unweighted
estimations, the concentration metrics at the sub-category level behave similarly to Table 6. This
robustness highlights that a few isolated technology categories, either pre-existing or entering
with recent USPTO additions, are not solely responsible for the patterns evident.
15
The USPTO issues patents by technology categories rather than by industries. Combining the work of
Johnson (1999), Silverman (1999), and Kerr (2008), concordances can be developed to map the USPTO classi…cation scheme to the three-digit industries in which new inventions are manufactured or used. Scherer (1984)
and Keller (2002) further discuss the importance of inter-industry R&D ‡ows.
16
For example, Griliches (1990), Kortum and Lerner (2000), Kim and Marschke (2004), Hall (2005), Ja¤e and
Lerner (2005).

14

Panels B and C report similar indices for English and non-English ethnicity inventors. Some
of the sharp concentration gains within the Computers and Communications and Electrical and
Electronic groupings can be traced to higher agglomeration of the English inventors. The
exceptional growth in concentration among non-English ethnic inventors, however, is even more
striking. Figure 7 presents the HHI of Computers and Communications patents for selected
ethnic groups. The Chinese HHI reaches just less than 0.200 by 2000-2004, while the Indian
concentration also grows to 0.141. Note that this concentration growth occurs during a period
of growing patent counts.
Ethnic inventors thus pull up the overall patenting concentration in at least three ways. First,
ethnic inventors have higher levels of existing concentration and are becoming a larger share of
US patenting (Figure 4). Even if their own concentration holds constant, this should lead to
an increase in the agglomeration of US patenting. Second, ethnic inventors are themselves
becoming more spatially concentrated in high-tech …elds. This force also leads to an increase
in overall agglomeration levels. Ethnic inventors are also more concentrated in …elds that have
experienced greater rates of recent patenting, yielding a mechanical link as well.17

3.5

Institutional Concentration of US Ethnic Inventors

Patents are granted to several types of institutions. Industrial …rms account for about 70%
of patents granted from 1980-1997, while government and university institutions are assigned
about 4% of patents. Unassigned patents (e.g., individual inventors) represent about 26% of
US invention. Public companies account for 59% of the industry patents during this period.
With the exception of unassigned patents, institutions are primarily identi…ed through assignee
names on patents.
Figure 8 demonstrates that intriguing di¤erences in ethnic scienti…c contributions also exist
by institution type. Over the 1975-2004 period, ethnic inventors are more concentrated in government and university research labs and in publicly-listed companies than in private companies
or as una¢ liated inventors. Part of this levels di¤erence is certainly due to immigration visa
sponsorships by larger institutions. Growth in ethnic shares are initially stronger in the government and university labs, but publicly-listed companies appear to close the gap by 2004. The
other interesting trend in Figure 8 is for private companies, where the ethnic contribution sharply
increases in the 1990s. This rise coincides with the strong growth in ethnic entrepreneurship in
high-tech sectors.18
17

These e¤ects appear to continue in the 2001-2006 applications data catalogued in Table 2.
Publicly-listed companies are identi…ed from a 1989 mapping developed by Hall et al. (2001). This company
list is not updated for delistings or new public o¤erings. This approach maintains a constant public grouping for
reference, but it also weakens the representativeness of the public and private company groupings at the sample
extremes for current companies.
18

15

Panels A and B of Table 7 document the evolution of the HHI concentration for industry
and university/government patenting, respectively. The column headers again indicate di¤erent
technology groups. Despite having fairly similar levels of spatial concentration, the di¤erences
between institutions in the agglomeration trends for patenting are striking. The concentration
of invention within universities and governments has either weakened or remained constant in
every technology group. The recent gains in industry concentration, on the other hand, are
stronger than the aggregate statistics from Table 6. Whereas the recent growth in industry
concentration is strongest for Computers and Communications and Electrical and Electronic,
the two technology groups show above-average declines for universities and government bodies.
The bottom two panels of Table 7 show the deeper impact of these institutional di¤erences
for non-English invention. Ethnic inventors are again very strong drivers for the recent agglomeration increases in industry patenting within high-tech sectors. On the other hand, ethnic
inventors are not becoming more geographically agglomerated within universities and government institutions. This even holds true for Chinese and Indian groups within the Computers
and Communications and Electrical and Electronic technology sectors. Figures 9 and 10 summarize these di¤erences. As universities and government bodies are more constrained from
agglomerating than industrial …rms, these di¤erences provide a nice falsi…cation check on the
earlier trends and the role of ethnic inventors.19

Conclusions

Ethnic scientists and engineers are an important and growing contributor to US technology
development. The Chinese and Indian ethnicities, in particular, are now an integral part of US
invention in high-tech sectors. The magnitude of these ethnic contributions raises many research
and policy questions: debates regarding the appropriate quota for H-1B temporary visas, the
possible crowding out of native students from SE …elds, the brain drain or brain circulation
e¤ect on sending countries, and the future prospects for US technology leadership are just four
examples.20 While the answers to these questions must draw from many …elds within and outside
of economics, valuable insights can be developed through agglomeration theory and empirical
studies.
This paper builds a new empirical platform for these research questions by assigning probable
ethnicities for US inventors through the inventor names available with USPTO patent records.
19
Trends in concentration ratios of unassigned inventors fall in between industry and university/government,
behaving more closely like the latter. While there is some recent growth in ethnic inventor concentration within
this class, the upturn is much weaker than in industrial …rms. Figure 8 also highlights that ethnic inventors are
a smaller fraction of unassigned patents, leading to a smaller impact on aggregate statistics.
20
Representative papers are Lowell (2000), Borjas (2005), Saxenian (2002b), and Freeman (2005), respectively.

16

The resulting data document with greater detail than previously available the powerful growth
in US Chinese and Indian inventors during the 1990s. At the same time, these ethnic inventors
became more spatially concentrated across US cities. The combination of these two factors
helps stop and reverse long-term declines in overall inventor agglomeration evident in the 1970s
and 1980s. The heightened ethnic agglomeration is particularly evident in industry patents for
high-tech sectors, and similar trends are not found in institutions constrained from agglomerating
(e.g., universities, government).

Notes: Panel A presents descriptive statistics for inventors residing in the US at the time of patent application. Inventor ethnicities are estimated through inventors'
names using techniques described in the text. Patents are grouped by application years and major technology fields. Metropolitan Statistical Areas include AUS (Austin),
BAL (Baltimore), BOS (Boston), KC (Kansas City), LA (Los Angeles), MIA (Miami), NAS (Nashville), NOR (New Orleans), NYC (New York City), PRT (Portland),
SA (San Antonio), SD (San Diego), SF (San Francisco), STL (St. Louis), WPB (West Palm Beach), and WS (Winston-Salem). MSAs are identified from inventors' city
names using city lists collected from the Office of Social and Economic Data Analysis at the University of Missouri, with a matching rate of 99%. Manual recoding
further ensures all patents with more than 100 citations and all city names with more than 100 patents are identified. Panel B presents comparable statistics calculated
from the 1990 Census using country of birth for scientists and engineers. Country groupings follow Table A3; English provides a residual in the Census statistics.

Notes: Estimations provide partial correlations for ethnic patenting undertaken in 244 MSAs over the 1985-2004 period. The dependent variable is the MSA's share of
indicated ethnic invention relative to the MSA sample. Explanatory regressors are from the 1990 Census of Populations, excepting coastal access and the lagged ethnic
patenting share. The latter is ethnic specific and is calculated for the 1975-1984 pre-period from the ethnic patenting database. Estimations are weighted by MSA
populations. Variables are transformed to unit standard deviation for interpretation. Robust standard errors are reported in parenthesis.

Notes: Metrics consider agglomeration of US domestic invention across 283 MSAs, with invention in rural areas
excluded. Top 5 MSAs are kept constant from 1975-1984 rankings: New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago,
Philadelphia, and San Francisco. Ellison and Glaeser metrics consider agglomeration of invention relative to MSA
populations. These latter metrics abstract from plant Herfindahl corrections. General population counts from 19951999 are used for 2000-2004.
