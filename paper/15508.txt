ABSTRACT
We estimate the level and distribution of global household wealth. The levels of assets and debts for
39 countries are measured using household balance sheet and survey data centred on the year 2000.
The determinants of mean financial assets, non-financial assets, and liabilities are studied empirically,
and the results used to estimate average wealth holdings for countries lacking direct evidence. Data
on the pattern of household distribution of wealth are assembled for 20 countries, which together account
for 59 per cent of the global population and 75 per cent of global wealth. The observed relation between
wealth and income distribution in these 20 countries allows estimates of wealth inequality to be produced
for many other nations. Combining the figures for individual countries reveals that net worth averaged
US$44,024 per adult in PPP terms across the globe. Wealth of US$8,635 was needed to be in the top
half of the global distribution, and US$518,364 to be in the top one per cent. The top 10 per cent owned
71 per cent of world wealth, and the Gini coefficient for the global distribution of wealth is estimated
to be 0.802, indicating greater inequality than that observed in the global distribution of consumption
or income.

Introduction

The world distribution of income has recently been the subject of much attention. Available
evidence suggests that global income inequality is high and not trending down over time
(Bourguignon and Morrison 2002; Milanovic 2002, 2005). Indeed, in some regions both
poverty and income inequality appear to be on the increase. Given these findings, interest
naturally turns to global disparities in other dimensions of economic status, resources or
wellbeing, of which one of the most important is household wealth. In recent years the
number of countries with good wealth data has increased and it is now possible to try to
estimate the global distribution of household wealth, which is the goal of this paper.
The core data for this exercise are provided by national wealth distribution data that are
available for 20 countries. These countries include the largest and richest countries in the
world and together account for 59% of the world’s population and, we estimate, 75% of its
wealth. While it is interesting to look at the distribution of wealth just for these countries, and
we do provide those results, our main focus is on an estimate of the full global distribution of
wealth. This requires imputation of both wealth levels and distribution to the countries with
missing data. Much of the paper is occupied with the development and application of those
imputations. We find that the global distribution of wealth so estimated is quite close to that
for the 20 core countries—yielding a Gini coefficient of .802 for example in comparison with
.796 for the core group.
Estimating the global distribution of wealth involves two stages. First, the average wealth
level in each country is established. This is done by using national household balance sheet
(HBS) data, and survey data where there are no HBS numbers, and then extending the wealth
figures to nations with neither kind of data using regression based imputations. The second
stage requires the shape of the distribution to be computed for each country. Again there are
countries with direct data (the 20 referred to above), and others for which the pattern must be
estimated using the best available proxies. Our ultimate aim is to produce household wealth
distribution estimates on a per adult basis for the year 20001. This paper focuses almost

1 Although HBS data are available annually in many countries, wealth distribution data typically come from surveys
that are conducted at intervals of three or more years and whose results are available only with a significant lag. The
year 2000 provides us with a reasonably recent date and good data availability.

exclusively on figures based on purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates. Davies et al
(2008) reports results from earlier work using official exchange rates.2.
This paper establishes, first, that there are very large inter-country differences in the level of
household wealth. The USA is the richest country in aggregate terms, with wealth estimated
at PPP$ 201,319 per adult in the year 2000. At the opposite extreme among countries with
wealth data, India has per adult wealth of $12,201 in PPP terms. Other countries show a wide
range of values. Even among high income OECD countries the figures range from $70,461
for Finland, and $79,585 for New Zealand, to $172,461 for the UK. We also find that the
wealth to income ratio rises with income or wealth, meaning that in poor countries the relative
shortfall of wealth is greater than that of income. This is a noteworthy result since the risks,
capital market imperfections, and lack of social safety nets that people face in poor countries
mean that personal assets seem to be most lacking where they are most needed.
International differences in the composition of wealth are also examined. Some regularities
are evident, but also country-specific differences—such as the strong preference for liquid
savings in Japan and some other countries. Real assets, particularly land and farm assets, are
more important in less developed countries. This reflects not only the greater importance of
agriculture, but also an immature financial sector (that is currently being addressed in some of
the rapidly growing developing countries) and other factors such as inflation risk. Among rich
nations, there is significant variation in the importance of financial assets and share-holding.
Concentration of wealth within countries is high. Gini coefficients for wealth typically lie in
the range of about 0.6–0.8. In contrast, most Gini coefficients for disposable income fall in the
range 0.3-0.5. The mid value for the share of the top 10 per cent of wealth-holders in our core
country-level data is 51 per cent, again much higher than is common for income.
The paper finds that global wealth-holding is highly concentrated, much higher than in the
case of income. The share of the top 10 per cent of adults in 2000 is estimated to be 70.7 per
cent and the Gini coefficient to be 0.802. The share of the bottom half is just 3.7 per cent.
Although inter-country differences are greater than in the case of income, we find that intracountry inequality is so much larger in the case of wealth that it accounts for a larger share of
global inequality than it does for income, according to the Gini coefficient. Thus the principal

2 The present paper differs from Davies et al (2008) not only in using PPP exchange rates, but in its empirical
framework for the estimation and imputation of wealth levels by country. This framework is set out in Section 3 of
the present paper. The estimate of global wealth distribution provided here supersedes that in our earlier work.

reason for the high global inequality of wealth may be the long-recognized high inequality of
wealth within countries.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section describes what can be
learned about household wealth levels and composition across countries using household
balance sheet and survey data. Section 3 presents our results on the determinants of wealth
levels, and assigns household wealth figures to the ‘missing countries’. Section 4 reviews the
available evidence on the pattern of wealth distribution, and then performs imputations for
other countries. In Section 5 the data on levels and distributions are combined to construct the
global distribution of household wealth. Conclusions are drawn in Section 6.

Wealth levels and composition in countries with data

This section assembles data on wealth levels and composition for as many countries as
possible. These data are of independent interest, but are also used in the next section to impute
per capita wealth to countries that lack wealth data. The exercise begins by taking inventories
of household balance sheet (HBS) and sample survey estimates of household wealth levels
and composition.3
2.1

Household balance sheet (HBS) data

As indicated in Table 1, ‘complete’ financial and non-financial balance sheet data are
available for 19 countries. These are all high-income countries, except for the Czech
Republic, Poland, and South Africa, which are classed as upper middle-income by the World
Bank.4 We term the data complete if they adequately cover each of financial assets, liabilities
and non-financial assets.5 Sixteen other countries have financial balance sheets, but no

3 The sources and methods for balance sheet and survey data are described in Appendices I and II.
4 The World Bank (WB) classification is used throughout the paper except that Brazil, Russia, and South Africa
were moved from the lower middle-income category to higher middle-income, and Equatorial Guinea from low to
lower middle-income. These changes were prompted by the fact that the WB classifications seems anomalous
compared to the Penn World Table GDP data that was used for the year 2000.
5 There are some national differences in asset coverage, particularly for non-financial assets. The figures for each
country with a complete balance sheet here include both owner-occupied housing and consumer durables. There is
some variation in coverage of other real estate. See Appendices I and II for more detail.

information on real assets. This group is less biased towards the rich world since it contains
six upper middle income countries and three lower middle income countries.
Regional coverage in HBS data is not representative of the world as a whole. Such data tend
to be produced at a relatively late stage of development. Europe and North America, and the
OECD in general, are well covered, but low-income and transition countries are not.6 In
geographic terms this means that coverage is sparse in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the
Caribbean. Fortunately for this study, these gaps are offset to an important extent by the
availability of survey evidence for the largest developing countries, China, India and
Indonesia. Also note that while there are no HBS data for Russia, complete HBS data are
available for two European transition countries and financial data for eight others.
The asset composition of household balance sheets in different countries, shown in Table 2,
reflects influences such as market structure, regulation and cultural preferences (IMF 2005).
For most countries, non-financial assets account for between 40 and 60 per cent of total
assets, with higher shares in the Czech Republic, New Zealand, Poland, and Spain. Housing
assets constitute a considerable share of non-financial assets. These assets include both
owner-occupied housing and rental property.7 In a number of countries, for example Italy,
Spain and the UK, the large increase in real estate prices in the late 1990s helps to explain the
high share of housing. The high share of financial assets makes South Africa stand out.8 The
USA is also an outlier in the share of financial assets, which is related to the strength of its
financial markets and importance of private pensions but also to the strong stock market
performance in the period leading up to the year 2000.
The composition of financial assets can be examined not only for the 19 countries with
complete balance sheets but also the 16 countries with only financial balance sheets. Striking
differences across countries are evident when financial assets are disaggregated. Liquid assets

6 Goldsmith (1985) prepared ‘planetary’ balance sheets for 1950 and 1978 and found similar difficulties in obtaining
representative coverage. He was able to include 15 developed market economies, two developing countries (India
and Mexico), and the Soviet Union. This produces a total of 18 countries, one less than the number of countries for
which we have complete HBS data for the year 2000.
7 Only housing owned directly by households or unincorporated businesses is included here. Real estate may also be
owned by other sectors, including the corporate sector.
8 One would expect real assets to be important in a developing country, but the well developed financial markets in
South Africa, combined with negative rates of return on investment in fixed property and high mortgage interest rates
in the 1990s, resulted in an unusually low share of non-financial assets in the year 2000 (see Aron et al. 2008).

are a large part of the total in Japan and in most of the European transition countries. The
preference for liquidity in Japan has a long history, but also reflects the poor performance of
real estate and shares in the 1990s (Babeau and Sbano 2003). The share of other financial
assets is particularly high in Australia, Austria, the Netherlands, South Africa, and the UK,
which may be partly due to the importance of pension fund claims in these countries. Italy has
a very low share of liabilities, a well-known phenomenon that is confirmed by survey data
(see below). Poland and the Czech Republic also have low debt ratios, reflecting the underdevelopment of mortgage and consumer credit in these transition countries.
2.2

Survey data

In order to check the HBS data and to expand our sample, especially to non-OECD countries,
household wealth survey data were also consulted.9 Country coverage is broader than in HBS
data (see Table 3). Most importantly, wealth surveys are available for the three most populous
developing/emerging market countries: China, India and Indonesia. These three countries,
together with Mexico in the case of non-financial assets, are used in regressions in Section 3
that provide the basis for wealth level imputations for our ‘missing countries’.
Like all household surveys, those of wealth are affected by sampling and non-sampling errors.
The high skewness of wealth distributions makes sampling error important. Non-sampling
error is also a problem due to differential unit response — wealthier households are less likely
to respond — and under-reporting, especially of financial assets. Both sampling and nonsampling error lead to difficulties in obtaining an accurate picture of the upper tail of the
wealth distribution (see Davies and Shorrocks 2000: 605-76, 2005). In order to offset these
effects an increasing number of surveys over-sample wealthier households. This is the
practice in the US Survey of Consumer Finances for example as well as in surveys in Canada,
Germany and Spain.10 Over-sampling at the upper end has not been adopted in the major

9 In the next section, where we must provide a single estimate for the wealth level in each country, we use HBS data,
where available, in preference to survey data. While HBS data are of course also subject to error, a country’s wealth
survey results can be, and normally are, used as an input in creating HBS estimates. Since the HBS estimates benefit
from additional inputs of information and data from other sources, they should, in principle, dominate wealth survey
estimates. The Survey of Consumer Finance (SCF) in the USA is of such high quality, however, that it is not clear
whether HBS or survey data should be preferred (see, for example, Bertaut and Starr-McCluer 2002: 181-218).
Fortunately for our purposes, HBS and SCF estimates of total household wealth in the USA in 2000 are very similar
(see below). Our results would differ little if the SCF had been used to establish the USA wealth level.
10 The SCF design explicitly excludes people in the Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest Americans, which again helps
to reduce the effects of sampling error; see Kennickell (2006: 19-88).

5

developing countries represented here, but these countries have much higher response rates
than are seen in the developed countries, and China and India have large samples, helping to
reduce sampling error.11
Aside from the USA — whose sophisticated Survey of Consumer Finance succeeds in
capturing most household wealth — surveys usually yield lower totals for financial assets
compared with HBS data, principally due to the lower response rate of wealthy households
and under-reporting by those who do respond.12 (See Appendix III for a comparison of wealth
estimates from household balance sheets vs. surveys.) In contrast, survey totals for the most
important non-financial asset, owner-occupied housing, are more accurate. (See Davies and
Shorrocks, 2000, p. 630.)
Table 3 reports asset composition in the survey data. It is clear that non-financial assets bulk
larger in surveys than in HBS data, reflecting both the relative accuracy of housing values in
survey data and the importance of non-sampling error in the case of financial assets. The table
also highlights the relative importance of reported financial and non-financial assets in
developed and developing countries. The two low-income countries in our sample, India and
Indonesia, stand out as having particularly high shares of non-financial wealth.13 This reflects
both the importance of land and agricultural assets and the lack of financial development. In
India, the only low or middle income country for which the composition of financial assets is
reported in Table 3, most of the financial assets owned by households are liquid. In Table 3,
China does not stand out as having a high share of non-financial assets. One reason is that the
value of housing is reported net of mortgage debt in China. Another is that there is no private

11 See Deaton (1995) on the high response rates to surveys in developing countries in general. As reported in Davies
and Shorrocks (2005), response rates in the 1991-92 Indian AIDIS were 95.7 per cent and 94.6 per cent in rural and
urban areas respectively. The sample size in the 2002 survey in China was 16,035, and in the 1991-92 survey in India
it was 57,031.
12 Statistical organizations fight these forms of non-sampling error through their survey technique and questionnaire
design. Once the results are in, it is also possible to try to correct for these errors. Particularly ambitious efforts have
been made in the Italian SHIW survey. Brandolini et al (2004) uses records of the number of contacts needed to win
a response to estimate the differential response relationship, which allows reweighting. He also uses results of a
validation study comparing survey responses and institutional records to correct for misreporting of selected financial
assets. Finally, this study also imputes non-reported dwellings owned by respondents (aside from their principal
dwelling).
13 This echoes the findings of Goldsmith (1985) who reported that India and Mexico had an average of 65 per cent
of national assets in tangible form in 1978, compared to 51 per cent for 14 developed market economies.

ownership of urban land. And of course there has been rapid accumulation of financial assets
by Chinese households in recent years. The ratio of liabilities to total assets is particularly low
in India and Indonesia (for China only non-housing liabilities are reported). Again poorly
developed financial markets help to explain this phenomenon. Italy also stands out as having
a very low share of liabilities. This low share echoes the finding in HBS data, and likely
reflects the relative lack of mortgage loans in Italy compared to other OECD countries.
Combining the balance sheet and survey data, it is evident that there are major international
differences in asset composition. Real property, particularly land and farm assets, are more
important in less developed countries, while financial assets are more important in rich
countries. There are also major international differences in the types of financial assets
owned. Savings accounts are favoured in transition economies and some rich Asian countries,
while share-holdings and other types of financial assets are more evident in rich Western
countries. Debt is also less important in developing and transition countries than in the more
developed countries (with the notable exception of Italy).
2.3

Wealth levels from household balance sheet and survey data

When wealth levels are compared across countries, one of the first issues to be confronted is
the appropriate rate of exchange between currencies. In comparisons of consumption or
income there is widespread agreement that international price differences should be taken into
account via the use of PPP exchange rates.14 This procedure seems appropriate for wealth
holdings also if the focus of attention is, say, the bottom 95 per cent of wealth-holders, for
whom domestic prices are the main determinant of the real value of their assets. However, a
large share of wealth is held by households in the top few percentiles of the distribution.
People in this category, and their financial assets, tend to be internationally mobile, making
exchange rates more relevant for international wealth comparisons among the rich and superrich.
This paper follows the convention of using PPP exchange rates to compare countries; unless
otherwise stated, all wealth figures are expressed in PPP US dollars for the year 2000.

14 There is, however, some disagreement about the type of PPP exchange rates that should be used. We follow
common practice and use the Penn World Table PPP rates, which are based on the Geary-Khamis method. This
method has many practical advantages, including desirable adding-up properties. The leading competitor is the
method proposed by Elteto, Koves and Szulc (EKS), which has been used by the OECD and Eurostat to compare
income across their member countries. See Neary (2004) for a discussion of the theoretical basis for the GearyKhamis method.

7

Selected comparable figures on an exchange rate basis are presented in footnotes and
appendices. They are also discussed in detail in Davies et al. (2008) which places more
emphasis on the upper tail of the distribution.
Table 4 summarizes information on the per capita wealth and income of countries with
complete household balance sheet or wealth survey data (data for individual countries are
given in Appendix III). Of the 19 countries that have complete HBS data, the USA ranks first
with per capita wealth of $143,727 in 2000, followed by the UK at $128,959, Japan at
$124,858, the Netherlands at $121,165, Italy at $120,897, and then Singapore at $113,631.
South Africa is in last place, at $16,266, preceded by Poland at $24,654, and the Czech
Republic at $32,431. The overall range is rather large, with per capita wealth in the USA 8.8
times as great as that of South Africa. The (unweighted) coefficient of variation (CV) among
the 19 countries is 0.440.
The next column shows GDP per capita. In the group of 19 countries with HBS data, the USA
again ranks first, at $35,619, and South Africa last, at $8,017. However, the range is much
smaller than for net worth per capita. The ratio of highest to lowest GDP per capita is only
4.4, and the coefficient of variation (again among the 19 countries) is 0.301. These results are
a first indication, which our full results confirm, that wealth is more unequally distributed
across countries than is income. Note that while it is well-known that wealth is more unequal
than income within countries, that common observation does not imply anything about
differences across countries. Column four shows personal disposable income per capita for
the same group of countries. The USA again ranks first, at $25,480, South Africa is again last,
at $4,691, and the ratio of highest to lowest is 5.4, slightly higher than for GDP per capita.
The coefficient of variation is 0.331, again slightly higher than that of GDP per capita. The
fifth column shows real consumption per capita, whose dispersion is intermediate between
that of GDP and disposable income. All in all, the per capita variation of net worth is much
greater than that of GDP, disposable income or consumption.
Differences across countries are even more pronounced in survey data due to the inclusion of
China, India, and Indonesia. Of the 13 countries with the pertinent data, the USA again ranks
first in net worth per capita, at $143,857, followed by Australia at $101,597, and Japan at
$91,856. In this group, India and Indonesia occupy the bottom two positions, at $6,513 and
$7,973, respectively. China appears to be about twice as wealthy as India, having per capita
net worth of $11,267. Note that the PPP adjustment has a proportionately greater impact on
the figures for developing countries. Using official exchange rates, all three countries have
much lower per capita wealth: India is at $1,112, Indonesia at $1,440, and China at $2,613.
Hence inequality in wealth between countries is greater using official exchange rates, as
reflected in the CV of 0.612 shown in the table versus 0.440 on a PPP basis. In the survey
8

data, as in the HBS data, the range in per capita wealth is much larger than that of per capita
GDP, disposable income, or consumption. The ratio of highest to lowest is 22 for wealth per
capita, 13 for both GDP and disposable income, and 17 for consumption. The coefficients of
variation for the income and consumption variables are again smaller than for wealth, and
higher using official exchange rates than PPP rates.
How large are the differences in the picture that one gets from HBS vs. survey data? There are
10 countries that have both types of data. For these countries the (simple) average of mean per
capita PPP wealth is $98,364 in HBS data and $74,579 in survey data, a difference of 24 per
cent. (The difference is 25 per cent using official exchange rates.) The correlation between
HBS and survey means is just 0.62 on the PPP basis, although it rises to 0.83, using official
exchange rates. The difference in means and the imperfect correlation are, we believe, largely
a result of the uneven quality of survey evidence across countries. Given the latter, it seems
clear that an approach in which one simply aggregated national survey data to estimate the
world distribution of wealth would be inadequate. Since more consistent information is
available, in the form of HBS data, in establishing wealth levels by country the latter should
be used as far as possible. That is the approach followed in estimating the global distribution
of wealth later in this paper.

3

Estimates of wealth levels and composition for all countries

The next step is to generate per capita wealth values for the remaining countries of the world.
As explained below, regressions run on the 39 countries with HBS or survey data enable part
or all of wealth to be estimated for many countries. This yields a total of 148 countries with
observed or estimated wealth, covering 95.2 per cent of the world’s population in 2000.
Separate imputations are made for the 81 countries that make up the remaining 4.8%, as
explained later in this section.
The purpose of the empirical exercise reported in this section is to predict wealth levels in
countries where wealth data are missing. This imposes certain limitations. Most importantly,
the independent variables in our regressions need to be available not only for the countries
with wealth data, but also for most of those without such data—otherwise we would not be
able to impute wealth to the “missing countries”. Fortunately, this limitation does not prevent
us from estimating a sensible empirical model of personal wealth levels across countries.

9

3.1 Empirical specification
The basic life-cycle model (LCM) under certainty and perfect capital markets, and without
government, provides a useful starting point for our empirical model.15 Suppose that
intertemporal preferences, and the ages of starting work and retiring were the same
everywhere, but that length of life, L, varied internationally. Assume also that the real interest
rate r was zero and that growth rates of both labour income and population, g and p
respectively, were constant but differed across countries. For simplicity assume that workers
are all employed full-time and have exogenous earnings. Then, mean wealth would be
determined by g, p, L, and mean earnings, y. In steady-state we would have:
(1)

W = f (g, p, L) y

(See Brumberg and Modigliani, 1980, or Modigliani 1988.) A strong prediction of the LCM is
that L will have a positive effect here. The growth rates g and p have a mild negative effect in
the simple LCM.16 The model can be extended to a world with government by redefining r
and y as net of taxes and transfers.
While (1) takes us some way, it does not provide the entire basis for an empirical
specification. Ideally one should take into account international differences in the age of
retirement, for example. This is unfortunately impractical since the data are not available on a
consistent basis for enough countries. But what of the role of the interest rate and that of
public pensions? The impact of r in the LCM is complex and ambiguous. Also, empirical
work finds conflicting, and often insignificant, impacts (Modigliani, 1988). Since we also do
not have good data on r for a large set of countries we do not attempt to include it in our

15 As far as we know, there have been no previous regression-based studies of the determinants of international
wealth differences. Part of the original motivation for the LCM was to explain international differences in saving and
wealth (see e.g. Deaton 2005). Results for international differences in saving have been mixed, but the life-cycle
framework has proven useful in studying saving at the micro level (see Browning and Crossley, 2001) and wealth
distribution in macroeconomics (see Cagetti and De Nardi, 2008). The LCM is fruitful in the present application in
part because one of its central predictions, that wealth should increase with longevity (assuming this translates into
longer retirements), holds here statistically.
16 Steady-state saving will increase with both g and p, but the wealth to income ratio (W/y) tends to decline mildly
with g and p. The reason is that there is, for the most part, a positive relationship between wealth and age in the LCM
(the working period of rising wealth is longer than retirement, and also early retirees have relatively high wealth).
Higher p increases the relative number of young people, reducing W/y. Higher g increases both the relative wealth
and labour income of the young, but the effect of this on average income tends to be stronger than that on mean
wealth, so again W/y tends to fall.

10

regressions. Pensions are a different matter. In the simplest version of the LCM, where
consumption is constant over the lifetime and r = g = p = 0, y can be replaced in (1) by y – b,
where y is net of pension contributions and b is the (constant) pension received in retirement.
Public pensions thus have a direct negative effect on private wealth. However, in more
complex versions of the LCM, and especially if impacts on age of retirement are taken into
account, the effect of public pensions becomes ambiguous. (See e.g. Gale, 1998.)
Nevertheless, although the evidence is mixed, several good empirical studies suggest a
significant effect of pensions on wealth within a country.17 We tested for a similar effect
internationally in the work reported below, but no significant impact was found.
It must also be recognized that the steady-state assumption is a poor approximation in some
cases, for example transition countries. Further, capital and other markets are not perfect.
Access to financial institutions and products varies across countries, as do housing market
institutions and the ease of mortgage finance. While (1) may provide a preliminary basis for
our work, these additional effects also need to be taken into account. We do this by
introducing a dummy variable for transition countries and introducing variables that may
reflect relevant capital market differences, as discussed below.
One approach here would be to simply regress log W on the “LCM variables” shown on the
right-hand side of (1), with some allowance for transition countries and capital market
imperfections. We can do that for the 23 countries that have data on both financial and real
wealth. However, there is one country (Mexico) with data on real assets alone and 15
countries with good data on financial assets and liabilities. It would be unfortunate to exclude
these countries, especially since they include a higher proportion of transition and middleincome countries. This raises the possibility of running separate regressions for real vs.
financial wealth. How does that square with the framework we have been developing?
The simple LCM is silent on the division of wealth between different kinds of assets.18 A
naïve hypothesis would be that the various assets would be held in the same proportion in
different countries. In this world one could run separate regressions for different asset groups,
but there would be no benefit since each regression would estimate the same coefficients
except for scale. And there could be a cost if measurement error in the dependent variable

17 See Gale (1998) for a summary, as well as Bottazzi et al. (2006) and Gale et al. (2007) on more recent work.
18 If current income is low people may be net borrowers in the LCM, which implies holding some debt. This is the
only prediction from the LCM regarding wealth composition, and even this prediction does not say much, since those
with negative net worth could have assets as well as debts, so that their net borrowing may differ from their debt.

11

declines in importance with aggregation, as seems likely here. We ran separate regressions on
real assets, financial assets, and liabilities using the same variables and found that the
hypothesis of a common structure was, in fact, strongly rejected. Further, as we see below,
there are grounds for introducing non-common variables in these regressions and they
perform well empirically. In this situation, as shown by Kennan (1989), there would be
aggregation bias if a single equation were run for W. And since this cannot be done for the full
sample of 39 countries in any case, our preferred approach is to run three separate regressions.
To give a behavioural basis to the three equations approach one must move beyond the simple
LCM and think about differences in asset characteristics, including risk and return. There is a
literature on optimal portfolio selection in a life-cycle context. It finds that the intuitive idea
that people should hold a less risky portfolio as they age is correct, at least beyond the middle
working years, under plausible assumptions. (See Benzoni et al., 2007, and Gomes et al.,
2008.) Here that might suggest, e.g., that countries with higher population growth should have
a higher ratio of financial to non-financial assets, assuming that financial assets are riskier.19
The amount that people will save depends on the menu of risks and returns on different assets.
One cannot generally decompose savings decisions into an “LCM decision” of how much to
save and a portfolio allocation decision. This indicates that in a more general version of the
LCM risk elements would affect mean wealth.
One of the most important personal assets, housing, is held for consumption as well as
investment purposes. With perfect markets this need not affect mean wealth. Households can
rent, or borrow freely to keep housing equity in line with life-cycle saving plans. However, in
the real-world mortgage finance is not so flexible, and tax or other institutions may favour
owner-occupation. In this context, impacts on mean wealth can come from the housing
market. For example, if the consumption demand for housing is inelastic, mean wealth may
tend to be higher where housing is more expensive.
Because errors in our three equations are likely to be correlated, we use the seemingly
unrelated regressions (SUR) technique due to Zellner (1962) (see Greene 1993: 486-99). This
involves stacking equations and estimating via generalized least squares. While OLS
estimates are consistent, SUR provides greater efficiency, with the gain in efficiency
increasing with the correlation of the errors across the equations, and decreasing with the

19 Benzoni et al. (2007) emphasize that the optimal share of risky assets is hump-shaped over the life-cycle when
cointegration of labor and stock returns is recognized. Whether a fast growing country would have a higher overall
ratio of risky assets in their model therefore depends on the shape and peak age of this hump.

12

correlation of the regressors used in the different equations. Since we have an equal number
of observations for financial assets and liabilities, but fewer observations for non-financial
assets, and since we believe errors are more likely to be correlated between financial assets
and liabilities than between the latter variables and non-financial assets, we have applied SUR
here only for financial assets and liabilities.
3.2 Wealth Regressions
Table 5 shows our main regression results. For comparison we show single-equation
regressions for log W as well as our three equations for asset subgroups. In each case we show
the preliminary specification (a) and the final specification (b). The two specifications mainly
differ in that variables that were insignificant in (a) are not used in (b). However, in a few
cases variables that were insignificant in (a) become significant when other insignificant
variables are omitted, and are retained in the (b) regressions.
Our first four regressors try to capture the four LCM variables y, L, g and p.20 We initially
used personal disposable income per capita for y, and it performs well. However, this variable
is not available for many of our “missing countries”, and so cannot be used to perform the
intended imputations. In Table 5 we therefore report results using real per capita
consumption21 to play the role of y — it is highly correlated with y in-sample and its use has
only a small impact on the estimated coefficients. This variable is significant at the 1% level
in all our equations. Interestingly, while the estimated coefficients are insignificantly different
from unity in most cases, for non-financial assets the coefficient is significantly less than 1.
The coefficient is very close to 1 for financial assets, and equals 1.199 for liabilities. These
aspects are important, since in our imputations financial assets will increase roughly in
proportion to income, but non-financial assets will rise less, and liabilities slightly more than
in proportion to income.

20 Various specifications were tried for public pensions, including the replacement of y by y – b in line with the
simple LCM. The y – b variable performed distinctly worse than y alone. When pension variables were introduced
independently they were insignificant in all our equations. (This may be partly explained by the fact that the variable
was not available for many of the low and middle income countries in our sample.) Given these findings, we do not
report regressions including a public pension variable here.
21 Real consumption per capita is from Penn World Tables 6.1 and is based on National Accounts (NA) data. NA
consumption data measure most forms of consumption on the basis of current purchases. An important exception is
housing consumption, which is measured by the value of housing services consumed. This means that the item
includes rents or, in case of home owners, imputed rents. See Commission of the European Communities et al., Ch.
IX, section D.

13

For L we use life expectancy in 1980, attempting to capture conditions when the average adult
of 2000 was in the middle of working life and forming expectations about his/her likely
length of life and retirement.22 This variable is highly significant for total wealth and for nonfinancial assets. It is also significant at the 5% level for both financial assets and liabilities.23
The growth rates g and p are each significant in just one of the (b) specification regressions in
Table 5. Per capita GDP growth is retained in the financial assets regression, but while
population growth is significant for total wealth, it is not retained in the (b) specification of
any of the three asset-specific equations. This general lack of significance may reflect the fact
that, as mentioned earlier, the impact of these variables on W/y is expected to be mild on the
basis of the LCM.
Turning to the additional variables, we used the (log of) population density as a proxy for
house prices, expecting a positive impact on non-financial assets, which is indeed found. (The
variable is also highly significant for total wealth.) Significant positive effects are found for
the market capitalization rate in the financial assets regression, and domestic credits available
to the private sector in the liabilities regression (both again in logs). These effects are
consistent with better functioning of capital markets leading to their greater use. The
urbanization (% urban) and phone participation (% with phones) variables were included as
they could affect ease of access to financial products. These variables were expected to have
positive effects on both financial assets and liabilities. This expectation was correct for
liabilities, but not for financial assets.
Finally, we have two dummies—one for cases where the data source is a survey rather than
HBS data, and the other for transition countries. The survey dummy is only significant in the
financial assets regression, but there it is highly significant and also has a large negative
coefficient. This means that if the data source is a survey, mean financial assets will tend to be
much lower than if the data are from national balance sheets. We use this result to adjust
upwards the estimates of mean financial assets in both the wealth levels and distributional
calculations reported below for China, India and Indonesia. The transition dummy has a
highly significant, but smaller, negative impact on non-financial wealth and total wealth. In
contrast to the survey dummy, we believe the transition dummy is telling us something about

22 Using 1980 rather than a more recent year for L also avoids the distortion in this variable caused in recent years by
the AIDS epidemic, particularly in sub-Saharan African countries.
23 Note the negative sign for liabilities, suggesting that higher mean wealth occurs partly through greater assets and
partly through lower debts.

the real-world—that the values of non-financial assets in transition countries are depressed,
perhaps due to incomplete housing markets and under-developed housing finance.
3.3

Estimated wealth levels

Table 6 summarizes the wealth levels obtained for the world and its regions. HBS data are
used where available (see Table 1); corrected survey data are used for China, India and
Indonesia. Financial assets and liabilities are imputed for 110 countries, and non-financial
assets for 125 countries, using the regressions described in the previous section. For the 81
countries that lack any data, the mean per capita wealth of the appropriate continental region
(6 categories) and income class (4 categories)24 were assigned. This imputation is admittedly
crude, but better than simply disregarding the excluded countries. It allows us, in the end, to
assign wealth levels to 229 countries.
Table 6 provides both per capita and per adult numbers, each weighted by their respective
population weight.25 For the world as whole in 2000, net worth was estimated to be $26,738
per capita and $44,024 per adult. North America accounted for 27 per cent of world
household wealth, much more than its 5 per cent share of world population and greater than
its 24 per cent share of world GDP. The ‘rich Asia-Pacific’ group and Europe show a similar
pattern, with wealth shares much greater than their population shares and larger than their
shares of world GDP.26 Given these results, it is not surprising to see that between-country
inequality, as shown by the Gini coefficient, is higher for wealth than GDP (0.583 vs. 0.503
respectively on a per capita basis). Note also that between-country wealth inequality is lower
using the per adult basis (which gives a Gini coefficient of 0.533), reflecting the fact that the
difference between wealth per capita and per adult is greater in poor countries, which have a
higher proportion of children in their populations.

24 Our regional calculations treat China and India separately due to the size of their populations. In the regional
breakdowns it was also convenient to distinguish the high income subset of countries in the Asia-Pacific region (a list
which includes Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and several Middle Eastern states) from the
remaining (mainly low-income) nations.
25 While per capita magnitudes are more familiar, we argue in the next section that it is best to analyze the world
wealth distribution among adults rather than all individuals. It is therefore helpful to begin looking at per adult, as
well as per capita, figures at this point.
26 Note that the disproportion between wealth and population shares, although large, is less for Europe than the other
high wealth regions. This reflects in part the inclusion of the lower wealth countries of Eastern Europe.

15

The rich Asia-Pacific group includes Hong Kong, which has the highest mean wealth in the
world on per capita basis and the second highest on a per adult basis according to our
estimates—$175,191 per capita and $228,675 per adult, or 5.2 times the world average per
adult (see Appendix VI as well as Table 6). This group also includes Japan and Singapore,
both at 3.6 times the world average per adult. Europe contains both very high wealth
countries, such as Luxembourg (the first place country per adult, as Hong Kong also with
wealth 5.7 times the world average), the UK (3.9 times the world average), and the
Netherlands and Italy (3.6 and 3.4 times the world average respectively), as well as low
wealth countries such as Moldova (29 per cent of the world average), the Ukraine (43 per
cent), and Albania (47 per cent).
Lower down the scale, China and India collectively accounted for 37 per cent of world
population in the year 2000, but only 16 per cent of world GDP and 14 per cent of the global
wealth. China’s net worth per adult was $19,056 (43 per cent of the world average) and
India’s was $12,021 (27 per cent). Latin American and the Caribbean had 9 per cent of the
world’s population and GDP, but 6 per cent of world wealth. Among this group, the
wealthiest countries include Barbados (3.4 times the world average per adult), Puerto Rico
(2.8 times), and Trinidad and Tobago (2.1 times). The less affluent countries in this group
include Haiti (18 per cent of the world average), Bolivia (19 per cent) and Honduras (27 per
cent).
Africa and ‘other Asia-Pacific’ countries together accounted for 33 per cent of the world
population but only 14 per cent of world GDP and 9 per cent of global wealth. Almost all
countries in the other Asia-Pacific group have net worth per adult below the world average,
except for Lebanon positioning itself just above the mean. Yemen (5 per cent) and Cambodia
(10 per cent) are the least wealthy countries in this group. With the notable exception of
Mauritius and the Seychelles (2.4 and 1.1 times the world average per adult), the African
nations are all below average in per capita wealth and include South Africa (66 per cent of the
world average), Zimbabwe (39 per cent), Kenya (22 per cent), Uganda (13 per cent), Tanzania
(5 per cent), and Nigeria (3 per cent).

Wealth distribution within countries

In order to estimate the global distribution of wealth we need estimates of the distribution
within countries. We start by assembling estimates for countries with hard data. We then
perform imputations for the remaining countries. The resulting estimates are intended mainly
as an input into our global calculations but also have some independent interest, as we bring
out in the discussion.27
As indicated in Table 7, information on the distribution of wealth across households or
individuals can be assembled for 20 countries. One set of figures was selected for each nation,
with a preference for the year 2000, ceteris paribus. In most countries there is only one
suitable data source. Where there was a choice we assessed sources in terms of how
comprehensive their population and asset coverage were, the unit used (adults being preferred
to families or households), and how well they dealt with sampling error, particularly as it
affects the upper tail.28 To assist comparability across countries, a common distribution
template was adopted, consisting of the decile shares reported in the form of cumulated
quantile shares (i.e. Lorenz curve ordinates) plus the shares of the top 10 per cent, 5 per cent,
2 per cent, 1 per cent, 0.5 per cent and 0.1 per cent.
The data differ in various respects. The economic unit of analysis is most often a household or
family, but in one case (China) the unit is individuals—of any age, and for France and the UK
it is an adult individual.29 Distribution information is usually reported for the share of wealth

27 Country-level wealth inequality statistics could potentially be used as regressors in studies e.g. of economic
growth or political stability. They may also be useful in the assessment of the success of financial systems and
public policies to encourage personal wealth. However, we would hope that researchers will show appropriate
restraint in their use of our country-level estimates where they are imputed rather than based on hard data.
28 In the USA for example, we have used the SCF, which is purpose-designed to estimate the distribution of wealth.
It has comprehensive asset and population coverage and a sophisticated strategy for dealing with the upper tail.
Estate-tax based estimates are also good in the upper tail, but are subject to a range of possible biases and do not
cover the middle or bottom of the distribution (Kopczuk and Saez, 2004). The PSID collects wealth data, but it
cannot compete with the SCF in estimating the overall distribution of wealth especially since there is no
oversampling of the upper tail (Juster and Smith, 1999). The situation in the U.K. and Germany is somewhat similar,
both having panel studies (BHPS and SOEP respectively—see Sierminska et al., 2006) with similar limitations to the
PSID. For the U.K. we use estate-multiplier data, which is good in the upper tail and is on a per-adult basis. For
Germany we have used the EVS survey conducted by the federal statistical office. The EVS has a large sample,
strong weighting procedures, and detailed asset coverage (Hauser and Stein, 2006)
29New Zealand uses the “economic unit”, defined as an unpartnered adult or a couple. This is effectively a narrowly
defined family. A “family” includes a group of people living together who are related by blood or marriage. A

17

owned by each decile, together with the share of the top 5 per cent and the top 1 per cent of
wealth-holders. But this pattern is far from universal. In some instances information on
quantile shares is very sparse. On other occasions, wealth shares are reported for the top 0.5
per cent or even the top 0.1 per cent in the cases of Denmark, France, Spain, and Switzerland.
The most important respect in which the data vary across countries is the manner by which
the information is collected. Household sample surveys are employed in 15 of the 20
countries.30 Survey results are affected by sampling and non-sampling error, as discussed
earlier. Non-sampling error tends to reduce estimates of inequality and the shares of the top
groups because wealthy households are less likely to respond, and because under-reporting is
particularly severe for the kinds of financial assets that are especially important for the
wealthy—for example, equities and bonds.
Other wealth distribution estimates derive from tax records. The French and UK data are
based on estate tax returns, while the data for Denmark, Norway, and Switzerland originate
from wealth tax records. These data sources have the advantage that ‘response’ is involuntary,
and under-reporting is illegal. However, under-reporting may occur nonetheless, and there are
valuation problems that produce analogous results.
Wealth tax regulations may assign to some assets a fraction of their market value, and omit
other assets altogether. There are also evident differences in the way that debts are
investigated and recorded. For most countries the bottom decile of wealth-holders is reported
as having positive net wealth, but in Sweden the bottom three deciles each have negative net
worth and in Denmark this is true for the bottom four deciles.31

“household” is a broader concept, including a group of people sharing a common dwelling unit. Definitions differ
slightly across countries and may be operationalized in different ways.
30 The list of countries differs a little from that used in Sections 2 and 3. Here the desire is to exploit distributional
information for as many countries as possible, so countries with data considerably earlier than 2000 were added:
Ireland (for 1987) and Korea (for 1988). In the absence of any better alternatives for these two countries, we take the
shape of the wealth distribution from the late 1980s to be a guide for the wealth distribution in year 2000. Sweden
was also added since its distributional detail is of interest, although the mean from this source was not judged
sufficiently reliable to be used in our estimates of wealth levels. The Netherlands was dropped due to insufficient
distributional detail.
31 Klevmarken (2006: 276-94) identifies a number of factors that helped to account for negative wealth shares of
Swedish households in the tax register data in the 1990s, and may still have been operative in 2002. These include
student loan debt, the inclusion of debt incurred to buy assets that are not covered in the data (mainly consumer

18

Table 7 shows that estimated wealth concentration varies significantly across countries but is
generally very high. Comparisons of wealth inequality often focus attention on the share of
the top 1 per cent. That statistic is reported for 11 countries, a list that excludes China,
Germany, and the Nordic countries apart from Denmark. Estimated shares of the top 1 per
cent range from 10.4 per cent in Ireland to 34.8 per cent in Switzerland, with the USA
towards the top end of this range at 32.7 per cent.32 The share of the top 10 per cent, which is
available for all 20 countries, ranges from 39.3 per cent in Japan to 76.4 per cent in Denmark.
The differences in wealth concentration across countries in Table 7 are attributable in part to
differences in data quality. In the case of survey data it is important to over-sample in the
upper tail to get the best possible estimates of top wealth shares. However, this is done in a
minority of cases - -just Canada, Germany, Spain and the USA in the data used here. In the
absence of oversampling in the upper tail, Davies (1993) concludes on the basis of evidence
for Canada and the USA that the share of the top 1 per cent may be under-estimated by about
5 - 10 percentage points. (See Davies, 1993, pp. 168-171 and p.176.) The surprisingly low top
shares seen here in some countries, for example Ireland, may reflect this phenomenon.33

durables) and a household definition in which young adults living at home with their parents, as well as unmarried
cohabiting adults, were counted as separate households.
32 The sampling frame for the USA survey excludes the Forbes 400 richest families; adding them would raise the
share of the top 1 per cent by about two percentage points; see Kennickell (2006: 20). Note also that this estimated
share is higher than that found in estate-multiplier data for the USA. See Kopczuk and Saez (2004) who report a
share of the top 1% of adults in the USA in the year 2000 of 20.8% using estate-tax data. There are differences in
asset coverage between the SCF and the estate-multiplier estimates, as well as problems of tax evasion and avoidance
in the estate-tax data. In addition the SCF uses a family rather than adult unit. As discussed by Kopczuk and Saez, it
is widely believed that the SCF provides a better snapshot of the distribution of wealth than the estate-multiplier data
at a point in time. However, the estate-multiplier data, which go back to 1916, have no rival in attempts to trace the
evolution of the USA wealth distribution over long spans of time.
33 Low top shares are also seen in some of the data we have rejected for countries with multiple sources. Shares of
the top 10% of 45% and 64% are seen in the UK’s BHPS for 2000 and the PSID (USA) for 2001 respectively
(Sierminska et al., 2006, Table 9), figures that are both lower than the estimates seen in our Table 7. Neither the
BHPS nor the PSID over-samples the upper tail, whereas Table 7 shows estate-tax based data for the UK, which do
not have a sampling problem in the upper tail, and SCF data for the USA, which over-sample the upper tail carefully.
The German SOEP for 2002 shows higher top shares than the EVS used in our Table 7 but the SOEP results are
distorted by the fact that most financial assets and non-housing debt are only recorded for values exceeding 2,500
euros, which exaggerates inequality (see Sierminska et al., 2006 again).

19

As evident from Table 7, the available sources provide a patchwork of quantile shares. In
order to move towards an estimate of the world distribution of wealth, more complete and
comparable information is needed on the distribution in each country. To achieve this,
missing cell values were imputed using a programme developed at UNU-WIDER which
constructs a synthetic sample of 1000 observations that conforms exactly with any valid set of
quantile shares derived from a distribution of positive values (e.g., incomes) (see Shorrocks
and Wan 2008.)34 To apply this ‘ungrouping’ programme, the negative wealth shares reported
for Denmark, Finland, Germany, and Sweden were discarded, together with the zero shares
reported elsewhere, thus treating the cell values as missing observations.
The 20 countries for which wealth distribution data are available include China and India, and
hence cover a good proportion of the world population. They also include most of the large
rich countries, and therefore cover most global wealth. However, the fact that the list is
dominated by OECD members cautions against extrapolating immediately to the rest of the
world.
For most countries lacking direct wealth distribution data, the pattern of wealth distribution
was estimated using income distribution data recorded in the WIID dataset, on the grounds
that wealth inequality is likely to be correlated—possibly highly correlated—with income
inequality across countries. The WIID dataset covers 144 countries and has multiple
observations for most of them. Where possible, data was chosen for household income per
capita across individuals for a year close to 2000, with first priority given to figures on
disposable income, then consumption or expenditure. Eighty-five per cent of the income
distributions conform to these criteria. Figures for gross incomes added a further seven per
cent, leaving a residual eight per cent of countries for which the choices were very limited.
The ‘ungrouping’ programme was then used to generate quantile shares for income (reported
in Lorenz curve form) according to the same template employed for wealth distribution.
The common template applied to the wealth and income distributions allows Lorenz curve
comparisons for each of the 20 reference countries listed in Table 7. In every instance, wealth

34 The first stage of the procedure fits a Lognormal distribution to the reported data and generates an equalweighted synthetic sample of 1000 observations which is approximately consistent with the recorded quantile shares.
The second stage adjusts the values of the observations within each quantile until the quantile shares for the synthetic
sample exactly match the true figures. Although other theoretical functional forms tend to provide a better initial fit to
wealth distributions, particularly in the upper tail, the second stage ‘stretching’ procedure improves the accuracy of
the Lognormal-based sample so much that the outcome is as good as, if not better than, the usual alternatives.

20

shares are lower than income shares at each point of the Lorenz curve: in other words, wealth
is unambiguously more unequally distributed than income. Furthermore, the ratios of wealth
shares to income shares at a given percentile are roughly similar across countries, suggesting
that income inequality can be used to generate an imputation for wealth inequality when
wealth distribution data are not available. Thus, in our imputations, the ratio of the Lorenz
ordinates for wealth compared to income is taken to be constant across countries. These
constant ratios (14 in total) correspond to the average value recorded for the 20 reference
countries.35 This generates estimates of wealth distribution for 124 countries to add to the 20
original countries which have direct evidence of wealth inequality.
The group of 144 countries with actual or estimated wealth distribution data differs slightly
from the group of 150 nations which have figures for mean wealth derived from actual data or
the regressions of Section 3. Distributional evidence is more common for populous countries,
so the group of 144 now includes Cuba, Iraq, Myanmar, Nepal, Serbia, Sudan, and
Uzbekistan, and covers 96.6 per cent of the global population. For the rest of the world not
covered by WIID data, the default of disregarding the remaining countries was again
eschewed in favour of imputing a wealth distribution pattern equal to the (population
weighted) average for the corresponding region and income class.

World distribution

In this section we present our estimate of the global distribution of wealth on a PPP basis.
Subsequently we test the sensitivity of this estimate to the use of PPP rather than official
exchange rates, and to the use of imputed data. The latter exercise allows us to present an
estimate of the distribution of wealth for just the 20 countries, with 59% of the world’s adult
population, that have hard data. First, however, we consider the choice of unit to be used in
these exercises.
The interpretation of data on personal wealth distribution depends on the underlying
population deemed to be relevant. Are we interested in the distribution of wealth across all
individuals, adult persons, or households or families?36 When examining the analogous issue

35 To circumvent aggregation problems, the adjustment ratio was applied to the cumulated income shares (i.e.
Lorenz values) rather than separate quantile income shares.
36 Note that each of these bases was used by at least one country listed in Table 6.

21

of global income distribution, it is common practice to assume (as a first approximation) that
the benefits of household expenditure are shared equally among household members, and that
each person should be weighted equally in the overall distribution. However, the situation
with wealth is rather different. Personal assets and debts are typically owned by named
individuals, and may well be retained by those individuals if they leave the family.
Furthermore, while some household assets, especially housing, provide a stream of communal
benefits, it is highly unlikely that control of assets is shared equally by household members or
that household members will share equally in the proceeds if the asset is sold. Membership of
households can be quite fluid (for example, with respect to children living away from home)
and the pattern of household structure varies markedly across countries. These aspects all
argue for the use of an individual unit rather than the household or family. There is an
additional, practical, reason for not using households, which is that the number of households
is unknown for most countries, whereas adult population data are readily available. Finally,
those under about 20 years of age have little formal or actual wealth ownership, and should
therefore likely be set aside. Thus, despite the fact that most of the datasets listed in Table 7
are constructed on a family or household basis, our goal is to estimate the distribution of
global wealth on a per-adult basis.
In estimating the global distribution we assume, in effect, that the shape of the adult
distribution of wealth at country level is the same as that of a family- or household-based
distribution. Adult and household distributions would indeed have the same shape if children
held insignificant assets, the number of adults per household did not vary systematically with
wealth, and wealth were equally divided among adults in a household. Children do have little
wealth. However, wealthier households on average have more adults, and although there has
been a trend towards more equal division of assets within marriage, equal division is not
universal. Studies have looked at what happens when, starting with adult data, one “pairs up”
a portion of adults into couples and measures inequality on a family basis. This reduces
inequality among married people, but increases measured inequality between singles and
couples. The effects are to an extent offsetting, but the net effect is to reduce measured
inequality somewhat.37 This impact should be borne in mind in interpreting our estimate of
global wealth inequality.

37 Wolff and Marley (1989) compared the share of wealth held by the top one percent of adults in USA estatemultiplier data with a lower-bound estimate of the share held by the top one percent of families, derived from the
estate-multiplier data via assortative mating assumptions. As reported by Wolff (2002, p. 82), they found a share for
the top 1% of adults of 19.1% vs. 12.7% for families in 1976. Atkinson and Harrison (1978, p. 248) found a smaller

5.1 Global Distribution
In order to get an estimate of the global distribution of wealth the national wealth levels
derived in Section 3 were combined with the wealth distribution data derived in Section 4.
Specifically, the ungrouping programme was applied to each country to generate a sample of
1,000 synthetic individual observations consistent with the (actual, estimated or imputed)
wealth distribution. These were scaled up by mean wealth, weighted by the adult population
size of the respective country, and merged into a single dataset comprising over 200,000
observations.38 The complete sample was then processed to obtain the minimum wealth and
the wealth share of each percentile in the global distribution of wealth. The procedure also
provides estimates of the composition by country of each wealth percentile, although these are
rough estimates given that the population of each country is condensed into a sample of
1,000, so that a single sample observation for China or India represents more than half a
million adults.
Tables 8 and 9 summarize our estimates of the distribution of wealth across the global
population of 3.7 billion adults. Only $8,635 was needed in order to belong to the top half of
the world wealth distribution in the year 2000; but to be a member of the top 10 per cent
required at least $89,569 and membership of the top 1 per cent required more than $518,364
per adult. This latter figure is surprisingly high, given that the top 1 per cent group contains
37 million adults and is therefore far from an exclusive club. The entrance fee has no doubt
grown higher still in the period since the year 2000. The figures for wealth shares show that
the top 10 per cent of adults owned 70.7 per cent of global household wealth, so that the
typical member of this group had 7.1 times the average global holding. The corresponding
figures for the top 5 per cent and top 1 per cent are 56.7 per cent (11.4 times the average) and
31.6 per cent (31.9 times the average), respectively. This contrasts with the bottom 30 per cent
of the distribution, which collectively owned just one per cent of global wealth. Thus the top
one per cent owned about 32 times as much as the bottom three deciles.

effect using U.K. data —a maximum decline from 30.8% to 25.6% in the share of the top 1% in going from an adult
to family basis. Frick et al. (2007) compare individual and household distributions of wealth using the 2002 German
SOEP survey. (It is very unusual for wealth survey data to allow such a comparison). Gini coefficients are .787 for
individuals and .734 for households, but this again gives an upper bound on the difference that interests us. The Frick
et al. calculation is on a per capita basis, which gives lower inequality for households than would be obtained with
the conventional equal weighting of households.
38 There are 229 countries in total, but a number of small countries with identical imputed wealth levels and
distributions were merged at this point.

23

Table 9 gives wealth Gini coefficients for the larger countries and for the world as a whole.
As mentioned earlier, wealth distribution is unambiguously more unequal than income
distribution in all countries which allow comparison. The wealth Gini coefficient estimates for
individual countries in Table 9 range from a low of 0.547 for Japan to the high values
reported for Brazil (0.784) and the USA (0.801). Appendix IV indicates that Switzerland,
whose distribution is based on hard data with good detail in the upper tail, has a Gini
coefficient of 0.803.39 The USA and Switzerland have Gini coefficients close to the global
wealth Gini of 0.802. Note that as is true within countries, the global figure is considerably
higher than the values computed for the global income distribution. Milanovic (2005: 108)
reports a Gini coefficient of 0.642, for example, for the world distribution of income in 1998
on a PPP basis.
Table 8 provides the regional representation in the various wealth quantiles. The top end of
the global wealth distribution is dominated by North America, Europe and the rich AsiaPacific countries, with Europe having 35 per cent of the members of the top decile, and North
America and rich Asia-Pacific each contributing just above 20 per cent. The North American
share rises rapidly in the upper tail, to 39 per cent in the top percentile, overtaking Europe
whose share declines to 31 per cent.
The middle half of the distribution is the domain of China, which supplies a third of the
membership of deciles 4-8. In contrast, India is concentrated at the lower end of the global
wealth distribution; the membership share is almost a quarter (21.9 per cent, in fact) for the
bottom three deciles, and then declines monotonically with wealth right up to the top tail. The
membership pattern of India is roughly similar to that of Africa.
Residents of Latin America and the Caribbean are spread across the entire global distribution,
reflecting the great inequality of wealth-holding in that region. Taken as a whole, Asia-Pacific
countries apart from China and India are also quite evenly spread, although there is high
polarization, with rich Asia-Pacific countries occupying the top end and the lower income
countries (especially, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Vietnam) being found in the lower
tail.
Table 9 provides more details for those countries that have either high wealth (more than one
per cent of global wealth or more than one per cent of members of the world top wealth

39 We saw earlier that Switzerland had the highest share of the top 1% for the countries with hard data on that share,
shown in Table 7. Dell et al. (2005) discuss the causes of Switzerland’s high wealth inequality.

decile) or else adult populations exceeding 45 million. A country’s ranking in the global top
wealth decile depends on a combination of three factors: population size, mean wealth, and
wealth inequality. The USA heads the list, with 19.4 per cent of the world’s top decile and
36.8 per cent of the top percentile. Large population, high mean wealth, and high wealth
inequality all reinforce each other in the USA case to produce this result. Japan comes a
strong second to the USA, with 14.1 per cent of the top decile and 12.0 per cent of the top
percentile. This strong performance reflects not only Japan’s population size, but also its high
personal saving rate and resulting high household asset levels. Germany, the UK, and Italy
follow Japan with 7.0, 5.9 and 5.8 per cent of the top decile respectively, accounting for more
than half of the 35.2 per cent population share of Europe in the top global decile. Note also
that Italy, like Japan, has very low representation in the bottom half of the world distribution,
and in particular relatively fewer members than the USA, Germany or the UK. This reflects,
in part, the remarkably low level of household debt in Italy.
Table 9 also reports figures for median wealth across countries, which reflect variations in
both mean wealth and inequality. One interesting observation is that median wealth rarely
exceeds 50 per cent of mean wealth. In addition, the rank order of countries changes
significantly when medians are used instead of mean values. Of the countries listed in the
table, the USA ranked first in mean wealth per adult, followed by the UK, Japan, and then
Italy. However, of this group, Japan ranks first in terms of median wealth per adult, followed
by Italy, the UK, and then the USA. Indeed, Japan’s median wealth was more than double the
figure for the USA although its mean wealth was 22 per cent lower.
Missing from Table 9, of course, are the world’s smaller countries, some of which are of
special interest. (See Appendix IV for details on all countries.) For example, some of the
countries with very high wealth rankings have much less spectacular income rankings. Hong
Kong and Ireland are examples of this. Also, some countries rank very high in per capita
income but are not close to the top of the wealth rankings. This is perhaps most notable for
the Nordic countries: Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Iceland. A possible
explanation is that strong public infrastructure and social programmes in these countries make
it less necessary for people to build up personal assets than in countries where there is less
public wealth and social insurance.
5.2 Sensitivity of Global Estimate to Assumptions and Imputations
We need to check the sensitivity of the global estimate to some key assumptions and to the
use of imputed data. In checking the latter aspect we will examine the distribution of wealth
for just the 20 core countries for which we have hard data.

25

We begin by checking the sensitivity of our results to the use of PPP rather than official
exchange rates. The first two rows of Table 10 show global estimates prepared on these
alternative bases. By lowering the wealth levels of poorer countries, the shift from PPP to
official exchange rates leads to a significant rise in measured inequality. The share of the top
decile increases from 70.7 to 85.1 per cent, and the share of the top percentile from 31.6 to
40.1 per cent. The world Gini coefficient jumps from 0.802 to 0.892, now far exceeding the
figure recorded for any individual country.40 The use of official exchange rates may thus be
viewed as magnifying wealth level differences across countries and ensuring that intercountry variations make a greater contribution to global wealth inequality.41
In contrast, Table 10 shows that the assumptions used during the course of our analysis have
very little impact on global wealth distribution. Rows 3–5 report the PPP figures
corresponding to row 1 after omitting countries for which data has been imputed from regionincome group averages. Row 3 discards those with imputed wealth levels; row 4 those
without income distribution data (and hence no way of estimating wealth inequality); and row
5 those with either form of imputation. The results show that the regional-income group
imputations affect less than 6 per cent of the global adult population and less than 3 per cent
of global wealth, so it is perhaps not surprising to discover no discernible impact on the global
wealth distribution.
The last two rows take an even more extreme position, excluding all countries except the 20
nations listed in Table 6 which have wealth distribution data. Restricting attention to these 20
countries loses 25 per cent of the world’s wealth and 41 per cent of the world’s adults.
Nevertheless, the figures in row 6 for our core group of 20 countries are little different from
the row 1 benchmark, with a top 1 per cent share of 31.7 per cent compared to 31.6 per cent,
for example, and a Gini coefficient of 0.796 compared to 0.802.

40 This parallels the result in Milanovic (2005) for the global income distribution. Milanovic has a world income
Gini coefficient in 1998 of 0.642 on a PPP basis but 0.795 using official exchange rates.
41 The particular approach to estimating PPPs used in the Penn World Tables, the Geary-Khamis method, may also
have an effect on our results. While it is widely used in the study of international differences in income this method
produces smaller estimated differences in living standards between rich and poor countries than some other popular
methods, for example the EKS method used by the World Bank (see, for example, United Nations 2007.) Using
PPPs based on the Geary-Khamis method likely leads to lower estimates of world wealth inequality than would be
obtained using the EKS method.

26

The final row 7 keeps the same 20 core countries but discards the ‘true’ wealth distribution
figures, replacing them instead with the estimate derived from income distribution data that
was applied to most countries. Comparing rows 6 and 7 suggests that the estimation
procedure reduces wealth inequality at the very top of the distribution, with the share of the
top 1 per cent falling from 31.7 per cent to 27.4 per cent. However, the share of the top two
quintiles rises and the share of the bottom three quintiles falls, suggesting a shift towards
greater inequality. The combined impact is evidently small, with the world Gini coefficient
changing from 0.796 to 0.801. Overall, it seems that our method of estimating wealth
distributions from income distributions, and the other estimation and imputation procedures
used during the course of our study, have little impact on the global wealth inequality figures.
The impact is certainly less than the change induced by switching from PPP figures to official
exchange rate valuations, which is a conceptual distinction rather than an assumption adopted
for computational convenience.
Other respects also lead us to believe that our estimates of the top wealth shares are
reasonable. The survey data on which most of our estimates are based under-represent the rich
and do not reflect the holdings of the super-rich. This suggests that our estimated shares of the
top percentile and top decile, for example, may err on the low side. A rough idea of the
possible size of the error is given by the total wealth of the world’s billionaires reported by
Forbes magazine for the year 2000, which was $2.16 trillion. This represents 1.7 per cent of
our figure of $125.6 trillion (at official exchange rates) for total world household wealth. Thus
if our estimates erred so badly as to exclude all the world’s billionaires, the shares of the top
percentile and top decile would be depressed by less than two percentage points.
As discussed in Davies et al. (2008), a further check was accomplished by fitting a Pareto
distribution to the upper tail of our estimated global wealth distribution (based on official
exchange rates). The Pareto distribution well approximates the upper tail of both income and
wealth distribution data at the national level, and is a remarkably close fit to our global
distribution in the range from $250,000 to $5 million. While the fit deteriorates at $10 million,
it gives us added confidence in the quality of our estimated distribution up to this point, which
covers all but a very small percentage of the world’s population.

Conclusion

This paper has found that the global distribution of household wealth is highly concentrated.
Using PPP valuations, we estimate that the top 10 per cent of adults in the world owned 71
per cent of household wealth in the year 2000 and that the Gini coefficient for global wealth
holdings was 0.802. Measured wealth inequality is higher still if international comparisons are
27

based on official exchange rates, which is appropriate if attention is focused on the rich and
super rich: the share of the top decile rises to 85 per cent and the Gini coefficient becomes
0.892. These statistics indicate that the world’s wealth distribution is considerably more
unequal than its income distribution, for which Milanovic (2005) reports Gini coefficients of
0.642 and 0.795 on PPP and exchange rate bases, respectively. The estimated distribution is
little altered if we restrict attention to the 20 core countries with hard data that have 59% of
the world’s adult population. For this core group the Gini coefficient of wealth is 0.796 on a
PPP basis.
This study began by assembling information on household wealth levels and portfolio
composition for as many countries as possible. Wealth levels vary widely and we find that the
wealth/income ratio for countries rises with income or wealth, so that international wealth
differences are greater, relatively speaking, than those for income. Also, we find that the
correlation of national income and wealth, while strong, is not perfect. The wealthiest
countries include some, like Ireland and Hong Kong, that rank significantly lower according
to per capita income. Similarly, some countries with very high incomes, such as the Nordic
group, rank much lower according to wealth. This finding calls attention to the fact that while
greater wealth is desirable ceteris paribus, it may not be a blessing if higher personal wealth is
due to pure asset price inflation (e.g. house prices) or if the higher wealth is needed to
compensate for deficiencies in public infrastructure, pensions or social insurance
programmes. The relatively low ranking of the Nordic countries may therefore be viewed as a
positive reflection of high quality public services and programmes.
Wealth composition was seen to vary, not only with the stage of development, but across
countries at similar income levels. These variations may be explained in terms of institutional
and traditional differences, varying importance of public pensions, and other factors. The
importance of both financial assets and borrowing rises sharply with per capita income and
with financial market development. Conversely, household balance sheets in poor countries
remain dominated by land and other tangible assets.
Using regression analysis and other imputation methods, mean wealth levels were assigned to
countries lacking adequate wealth data. This generates estimated wealth levels for 229
countries and a snapshot of what Milanovic (2005) and others refer to as ‘international
inequality’, that is inequality between countries. On a PPP basis, wealth per adult for most
countries fell between the figure of $12,021 for India and $201,319 for the United States in
the year 2000. The between-country Gini coefficient for wealth per adult was 0.533 compared
to 0.448 for GDP per adult.

28

Having obtained estimates of wealth level by country, details of the shape of the wealth
distribution were assembled for as many countries as possible. The data covered 20 countries,
which together account for 59 per cent of the world population in 2000 and, we estimate, 84
per cent of global wealth. Wealth inequality varies widely across these countries but is always
greater than income inequality. The group includes all the populous rich countries along with
the largest developing nations, China, India and Indonesia. It allows us to study the relation
between wealth distribution and income distribution, and to generate rough estimates of
wealth inequality for 124 countries that have income distribution data but no wealth
distribution data. Simple imputations of wealth inequality were applied to the remaining
countries, which comprised less than four per cent of the world population. Combining the
wealth distribution estimates with the wealth level numbers, and weighting by population,
then yielded our estimates of the world distribution of wealth.
Our estimate of 0.802 for the world wealth Gini coefficient is high, both compared to the Gini
values for many countries, and compared to Gini values that have been estimated for the
world distribution of income. However, it is interesting to note that some countries have
similarly high values of wealth Gini coefficients. Among countries with hard data these
include the USA at 0.801 and Switzerland at 0.803. According to the Gini coefficient,
therefore, such countries contain within their borders about the same level of wealth
inequality as is seen in the world as a whole.
Our results also allow us to comment on the relative importance of between- vs. withincountry wealth inequality. As reported earlier, between-country differences in wealth per
adult yield a Gini coefficient of 0.533 on a PPP basis. Adding within-country differences
pushes the Gini coefficient to 0.802, suggesting that within-country differences are a very
important component of world wealth inequality. This impression is confirmed by comparison
with the world income distribution results of Milanovic (2005), which show a betweencountry Gini coefficient of 0.531 and a full Gini coefficient of 0.641 in 1998 (for a common
sample of countries over the years 1988-98). The Milanovic results thus show betweencountry income inequality equal to 83 per cent of total inequality, which is much greater than
the 71 per cent obtained here for wealth.
We have discussed the regional aspect of global wealth distribution as well, pointing out the
dominance of North America, Europe and the rich Asia-Pacific countries in the top global
percentiles. The popular press sometimes suggests that high wealth individuals from emerging
market economies—especially China, India and Russia—are already strongly represented
among the world’s rich. Our figures indicate that at least as of the year 2000 the emerging
market economies did not supply a significant share of the top 1% of global wealthholders.
With the possible exception of China they appear unlikely to do so for some time.
29

While this paper makes a start in estimating the world distribution of wealth, it is clear that
there are gaps in the data and significant concerns about data quality in some countries.
Globally, there is great room for improvement in the study of household wealth. Household
balance sheets and wealth surveys need to be generated in many more countries. These are
completely lacking in Latin America, and almost totally absent in Africa. The development of
financial institutions and property rights are key aspects of economic growth and human
development. Without the relevant data it is impossible to see what progress is being made.
Improvements in data quality, particularly in survey data, must also occur. The task is far
from hopeless, however, and great strides have been taken in several countries. The fact that
regular wealth surveys are conducted in the two largest developing countries, China and India,
is encouraging. As balance sheet studies spread, and as more and better surveys are
conducted, a better picture will emerge of the level, composition and distribution of household
wealth around the globe.

Note: The non-financial regressions use Ordinary Least Squares and a sample consisting of 19 countries with HBS data and 4 with survey data. The
financial assets and liabilities regressions use the Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) method and a sample consisting of 35 countries with HBS
or financial balance sheet data and 3 with survey data. Standard errors are given in parentheses. Significance: * 10% level; ** 5% level; *** 1%
level. R2 is not a well-defined concept in generalized least squares, so as is customary the fraction of the variance in the dependent variable that is
‘explained’ in each regression is referred to as ‘R2’ here.

Appendix I: Household balance sheet (HBS) data: methods
There is considerable variation between countries in how household balance sheets are constructed,
who puts them together, sectoral definition, and asset coverage. In some countries, for example
Australia, the UK, and France the balance sheets, or at least their major elements, are compiled as part
of the system of national accounts (SNA). Elsewhere, for example the USA, Canada, and Japan, they
are assembled together with flow of funds (FOF) data. In other cases central banks or national
statistical agencies issue HBS data independent of the SNA or FOF. The OECD publishes the financial
balance sheet of the household sector for its member countries (OECD 2005).1 As reflected in our
Table 1, however, fully comparable household balance sheets including non-financial assets are
available for only a subset of OECD countries.
What is important is not who delivers the HBS data, but who and what are covered, and how the data
are constructed. The objective is to estimate the balance sheet of the household sector as of a certain
date—often but not always the year-end. This can be done by trying to measure the relevant stocks, or
by updating previous stock figures by adding estimates of subsequent flows. Both stocks and flows
can be measured by direct or indirect means (Aron et al. 2008). In the direct approach data are
collected from household members through sample surveys, censuses or administrative records. In the
indirect approach the values for the household sector by asset type are calculated as residuals from
independent totals by deducting the estimated holdings of other sectors. Often the independent totals
are counterpart data, for example the liabilities of the banking sector in the form of deposits. In most
countries a mix of direct and indirect approaches is used.
In the USA, for example, most categories of financial assets and liabilities are calculated using the
indirect approach (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 2003). That is, amounts held or
owed by the other sectors are subtracted from known totals and the remainders are assumed to be the
amounts held by the household sector. For consumer credit no deductions are necessary. When microdata are available, assets and liability totals for the household sector are reviewed in light of that data
and sometimes adjusted accordingly. The Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), which is conducted
every three years by the Federal Reserve Board, is used for this purpose. House values and equity in
unincorporated business are estimated using the perpetual inventory method. Land values are updated
based on an index of land prices.
In the UK, financial assets are measured mostly using the residual approach based on data from banks
and other financial intermediaries. Ordinary shares are estimated with the help of a sample survey, the
Share Registers Survey, whereas unlisted company shares are estimated using the estate multiplier
method. Data on life assurance and pensions funds are obtained from returns made by insurance
companies and pension funds. The value of fixed assets is derived using a number of sources. Some of
the net capital stock estimates included in non-financial assets are calculated using the perpetual
inventory method (Aron et al. 2008). Residential housing stock estimates are compiled using property
tax records of local authorities, and farm land and buildings are estimated from data on farm sizes and
prices from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.

47

As a final example, in Italy financial assets are also measured using the residual approach and are
based on data from banks, credit institutions, insurance companies etc. (Brandolini et al. 2004). Debts
comprise all short and long term liabilities and are estimated using the same approach. The stock of
dwellings is based on a series provided by the Italian Statistics Office given at constant rather than
market prices. The series is corrected to be expressed in market prices using a housing price series
based on information assembled in a semi-annual survey of real estate agents. Benchmark values of
the stock of dwellings and the share owned by households are obtained using census data. Apart from
housing assets, only durables are included in fixed assets. The stock of durables is computed using the
perpetual inventory method.
Non-financial coverage in the HBS data is not completely uniform. While the data for all countries
considered here include owner-occupied housing there are variations in the coverage of other real
estate and consumer durables, as reflected in Appendix IIB. It is difficult to devise a satisfactory
estimation procedure for land or investment real estate,2 so these items have not been imputed. Since
only four countries lack these items entirely, and eight countries, including the USA, have complete
data, the impact would not be substantial, although the omissions will have some effect on our results,
In contrast, it is reasonably easy to construct estimates of consumer durables, and since this improves
the non-financial asset coverage for thirteen countries, these imputations were included.3
Appendix IIB also reveals differences in sectoral definition across countries. We aimed for a
household sector which covered the assets and debts of households and unincorporated business.
However, non-profit organizations (NPOs) are sometimes grouped with households. Data for the UK
and USA allowed us to exclude NPOs. This correction is especially important for the USA, where
NPOs account for about 6 per cent of the financial assets of the household sector (Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System 2003). The USA appears to be something of an outlier in terms of the
importance of NPOs.

Financial balance sheets for the household sector have also been published for eight countries in ‘New Europe’ by a
financial group based in Italy. See UniCredit Group (2005). The countries covered are Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic,
Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Turkey. We were only able to obtain non-financial data for the Czech Republic,
and so it is the only one of these countries for which complete balance sheet numbers are reported in this paper.

While balance sheet figures for dwellings also capture the value of land on which they stand, other land is missing for
Denmark, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Singapore. Investment or commercial real estate is missing for the
Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal and Singapore, and for Italy (which covers all housing, whether owner occupied
or not, but not other real estate). To the best of our knowledge, all real estate and land owned by households is
included in the data in all other cases.
3
Durables figures are available for Canada, the USA, Germany, Italy and South Africa. The mean ratio of durables to GDP in
Canada and the USA was used to impute durables to Australia, New Zealand, and the UK. For European countries other than
the UK, the mean ratio for Germany and Italy was used. Finally, the mean ratio for Canada, the USA, Germany, and Italy
was used for imputations for Japan and Singapore.

Note: The non-financial regressions use Ordinary Least Squares and a sample consisting of 19 countries with HBS data and 4 with survey data.
The financial assets and liabilities regressions use the Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) method and a sample consisting of 35 countries with
HBS or financial balance sheet data and 3 with survey data. Standard errors are given in parentheses. Significance: * 10% level; ** 5% level; ***
1% level. R2 is not a well-defined concept in generalized least squares, so as is customary the fraction of the variance in the dependent variable
that is ‘explained’ in each regression is referred to as ‘R2’ here.
Sources: (a) Life expectancy in 1980, gdp growth gdp per capita growth, population growth, market capitalization rate, availability of domestic
credit, urban population and fixed line and mobile phone subscribers are from World Development Indicators 2005-2008. b) Personal disposable
income is from the EIU. See The Economist Intelligence Unit (2005). (c) Data for Taiwan is from the National Statistical Office’s website.
