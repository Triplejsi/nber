Currency Carry Trade Regimes: Beyond the Fama Regression
Richard Clarida, Josh Davis, and Niels Pedersen
NBER Working Paper No. 15523
November 2009
JEL No. F3,F31
ABSTRACT
We examine the factors that account for the returns on currency carry trade strategies. Using a dataset
of daily returns spanning 18 years for 5 different long - short currency carry portfolios, we first document
a robust empirical relationship between carry trade excess returns and exchange rate volatility, both
realized and implied. Specifically, we extend and refine the results in Bhansali (2007) by documenting
that currency carry trade strategies implemented with forward contracts have payoff and risk characteristics
that are similar to those of currency option strategies that sell out of the money puts on high interest
rates currencies. Both strategies have the feature of collecting premiums or carry to generate persistent
excess returns that unwind sharply resulting in losses when actual and implied volatility rise.
We next also document significant volatility regime sensitivity for Fama regressions estimated over
low and high volatility periods. Specifically we find that the well known result that a regression of
the realized exchange rate depreciation on the lagged interest rate differential produces a negative
slope coefficient (instead of unity as predicted by uncovered interest parity) is an artifact of the volatility
regime: when volatility is in the top quartile, the Fama regression produces a positive coefficient that
is greater than unity. The third section of the paper documents the existence of an intuitive and significant
co-movement between currency risk premium and risk premia in yield curve factors that drive bond
yields in the countries that comprise carry trade pairs. We show that yield curve level factors are positively
correlated with carry trade excess returns while yield curve slope factors are negatively correlated
with carry trade excess returns. Importantly, we show that this correlation is robust to the current crisis
and to the inclusion of equity volatility in the model. What distinguishes carry trade returns in the
current crisis from non crisis periods is not changed loading on yield curve factors but a much larger
loading on the equity factor.

Introduction

One of the enduring puzzles in international …nance is the failure of uncovered interest
parity (UIP). In a risk neutral world, the forward exchange rate should be an unbiased
predictor of the future spot exchange rate. This prediction has been consistently
rejected, starting with classic contributions by Meese and Rogo¤ (1981), Hansen
and Hodrick (1981), Cumby and Obstfeld (1980), and most famously Fama (1984).
Contrary to professional opinion at that time, the UIP puzzle has not been arbitraged
away over time, nor has interest in it waned, as recent innovative papers by Burnside
et. al. (2007) and Brunnermeier et. al. (2008) demonstrate.
Today, just as 25 years ago, papers continue to …nd that currencies in countries
with high interest rates tend on average to appreciate relative to currencies in countries with low interest rates. This stylized fact constitutes the forward rate bias
puzzle. The direct implication of the puzzle is that investors can make systematic
pro…ts by shorting the low yielding currency and taking a long position in the high
yielding currency. This view is often expressed in terms of the apparent pro…tability
of the carry trade, which has become a popular investment strategy in the asset
management industry.
The key question is whether the excess returns associated with the carry trade can
be justi…ed by the economic risks associated with the strategy. Can the systematic
excess return be rationalized in terms of a meaningful currency risk premium? More
generally, are the excess return properties of FX rates consistent in a modern multicountry asset pricing framework? In this paper, we contribute to the literature on
the carry trade and the forward exchange rate bias puzzle along several dimensions.
First, we provide evidence that carry trade returns are strongly, systematically, and
inversely related to both realized and actual exchange rate volatility. This is true for
daily returns on a range of currency carry trade portfolios spanning 18 years, and, to
a point, is robust to exclusion of the yen from the currency carry portfolio. Second,
we document signi…cant volatility regime sensitivity for Fama regressions estimated
over low and high volatility periods. Speci…cally we …nd that the well known result
that a regression of the realized exchange rate depreciation on the lagged interest
3

rate di¤erential produces a negative slope coe¢ cient (instead of unity as predicted
by uncovered interest parity) is an artifact of the volatility regime: when volatility is
in the top quartile, the Fama regression produces a positive coe¢ cient that is greater
than unity. When volatility is high, UIP is violated but because low interest rate
countries appreciate by more than the interest rate di¤erential in favor of the high
interest rate country. Third, we document the existence of an intuitive and signi…cant
co-movement between currency risk premium and risk premia in yield curve factors
that drive bond yields in the countries that comprise carry trade pairs. Campbell
and Clarida (1987) were among the …rst to model theoretically and empirically the
joint determination of yield curve term premia and carry trade risk premia, but for a
variety of reasons, since then the yield curve literature has, to some extent, become
divorced from the currency risk premium literature2 .
We aim to rectify this divorce (amicably we hope!) by showing that yield curve
level factors are positively correlated with carry trade excess returns while yield curve
slope factors are negatively correlated with carry trade excess returns. Importantly,
we show that this correlation is robust to the current crisis and to the inclusion of
equity volatility in the model. What distinguishes carry trade returns in the current
crisis from non crisis periods is not changed loading on yield curve factors but a much
larger loading on the equity factor.
Our empirical investigation is related to those of Brunnermeier, Nagel & Pedersen
(2008) and Ichiue & Koyama (2007). Brunnermeier et al. examines the relationship
between volatility and FX returns and their conclusion is similar to ours. They also
…nd that higher market volatility is associated with carry trade losses, whereas Ichiue
& Koyama estimate regime-switching models for a select set of currency pairs. They
…nd that two regimes are necessary to explain the currency carry trade strategy
and these regimes appear consistent with the two sets of volatility dependent Famaregression coe¢ cients that we document in this paper. The empirical work in our
paper signi…cantly adds to these …ndings by showing their robustness across currency
pairs and volatility measures.

See however, Bekaert and Hodrick (2001) and Clarida, Sarno, Taylor, Valente (2002) for recent
papers that study yield curves and currencies jointly.

Our …ndings are also related to a number of recent papers that have examined
the risk return pro…le of the carry return strategy and explored underlying theoretical explanations. Backus, Foresi & Telmer (2001) derive restrictions on the pricing
kernel between two countries that need to be satis…ed for the forward exchange rate
bias puzzle to be consistent with a two country exactly a¢ ne interest rate model.
Bhansali (2007) is perhaps the most signi…cant inspiration for our approach as it is
this paper that clearly and directly focuses on the striking parallel between on currency carry trade strategies implemented with forward contracts and the payo¤ and
risk characteristics of currency option strategies that sell out of the money puts on
high interest rates currencies. Both strategies have the feature of collecting premiums or carry to generate persistent excess returns that unwind sharply resulting in
losses when actual and implied volatility rise. A recent literature has given increased
attention to the micro-structure of the currency market and the importance of the
balance sheets of levered market participants. In Brunnermeier, Nagel & Pedersen
(2008) levered market participants gradually build up positions in high yielding currencies causing the high yielding currencies to appreciate over time along with the
speculators larger positions. The model is thereby consistent with a systematic violation of uncovered interest parity. Another key implication of their model is that
FX movements are asymmetric, allowing them to focus on the skewness observed in
the currency return data. Jurek (2008) uses options data and prices to show that
crash risk in itself is unable to justify the expected return on the carry strategy; the
costs of insuring the carry portfolio against major crashes of the carry currency only
reduces excess returns by 30-40%.

Currency Carry Trade Returns and Exchange
Rate Volatility

Our …rst dataset is from Bloomberg and contains realized carry returns on portfolios that invest in high yielding G10 currencies by borrowing in low yielding G10
currencies. Each of these portfolios is an equally weighted long/short basket. The
distinguishing feature of each basket is the number and type of currencies included in
the basket. For example, the single cross, 1 v 1, portfolio consists of a long position
in the highest yielding currency at any given point in time and a short position in the
lowest yielding currency. The 2 v 2 portfolio consists of equal weighted long positions
in the two highest yielding currencies and short positions in the two lowest yielding
currencies. The addition of another cross adds two more currencies, the long positions always being an equal weighted basket of the highest yielding currencies and
the short positions taken in an equally weighted basket of lowest yielding currencies.

Table (1). Summary statistis for returns on …ve FX portfolios with and without USD and JPY.

Figure 1a displays the cumulative returns on portfolios that consist of three long
FX positions and three short FX positions. The 3 v 3 portfolio is based on all G10
currencies, whereas the two other portfolios exclude respectively the JPY and the
USD and JPY from the currency baskets. We do this because much of the existing
carry trade evidence in the literature has been more or less exclusively derived from
currency pairs involving either the US dollar or the Japanese yen. This is primarily
because Japan has had one of the lowest interest rates in the world throughout the
last 15-20 years, and the yen has therefore been included as the ’natural’choice of
funding currency, whereas the dollar traditionally has been considered the benchmark
investment currency. In our view it is nonetheless important to assess the forward
bias anomaly in a broader light. Especially, because the dollar is ’di¤erent’ from
other G10 currencies in that it remains the global reserve and vehicle currency and
therefore bene…ts from this status in ‡ight to quality episodes (including the present).
It is evident from …gure 1a, that currency carry trade strategies have provided
positive returns on average over the sample period, but that there have been signi…cant variation in the pro…tability of these strategies over time with several very
large negative return ’events’during the course of the 18 year sample period. Some
of the more dramatic changes in the carry returns or unwinds can be associated with
7

speci…c and well-known crisis periods in the global economy such as the Asian Crisis,
LTCM etc. The performance of the carry trade is further investigated in table 1,
which shows overall summary statistics for the returns on all the strategies considered in this section. The table clearly shows, that there are diversi…cation bene…ts
from using more currencies in the carry trade portfolio. As the number of currencies
in the portfolio baskets is increased the return volatility falls dramatically. At the
same time, this diversi…cation of risk across additional currencies in both the high
yielding basket and the low yielding basket, invariable reduces the pure "carry" return component and this means that average returns tend to decline as more G10
currencies are included in the portfolio. For example, the 1 v 1 portfolio has a mean
return of 5 percent whereas the mean return of the 5 v 5 portfolios is 3.3 percent.

Figure 1b shows the returns of 4 v 4 against pure USD-JPY carry trade.

Overall, the returns to currency carry portfolios are positive with Sharpe ratios
that are comparable or superior to those on equity investments (Burnside et. al.)
with or without the inclusion of the yen or dollar.
The e¤ects of including- or excluding JPY and USD in the set of currencies used
in the carry strategy portfolios are interesting. Indeed from 1 v 1 through 3 v 3,
the portfolios ex Japan and the US have higher mean returns and lower variance of
8

returns. These di¤erences are highlighted in …gure 1b which shows the performance
of the 4 v 4 strategy against the pure USD/JPY carry trade. A striking feature of
the …gure is that the short yen, long dollar trade has provided the same total return
as 4 v 4 strategy over the sample period.

2.1

Volatility and carry trade returns

As a …rst illustration of the strong and robust relationship between carry returns and
FX volatility, we examine the time series variation in realized carry return volatility
and realized returns for the 3 v 3 portfolio. Let rt be the carry return. We then
de…ne realized volatility, t ; and realized returns, t ; in the daily Bloomberg dataset
as exponentially weighted moving averages (EWMA), such that,

We choose the exponential decay parameter to be 0.95 for the daily data series,
which implies a half-life in the exponential weights of 14 days. In …gure 2 we then
relate the time series behavior of realized return volatility(in logs) to realized carry
returns. To facilitate the comparison of the two series, we choose to Z-score both
log( t ) = L;t and t and to depict the negative of the scaled volatility series. More
precisely, we construct, the following series,

and we graph Z against Z L for the 3 v 3 carry trade portfolio. These are therefore
Z-scored with respect to the full sample moments. Figure (2) shows that the two
scaled time series generally track each other closely over the full sample period.
Overall, the correlation is 0.55, but the correlation actually increases over time and

10

is 0.65 in the sub-sample period that starts in 1996. The implication of this comovement is that when the carry returns are high, return volatilities are low and
vice versa.

Figure (2) shows the relationship between realized return and realized FX-volatility for the ’3v3’ carry portfolio.
Construction of series described in text.

Motivated by the apparent correlation between FX - volatility and returns on
the carry strategy, we recompute the statistics from table 1, but divide the sample
according to realized volatility. Speci…cally, we split the sample into two regimes; a
’high’volatility and ’low’volatility regime. These are de…ned in terms of the quartiles
of the empirical distribution of volatility over the sample period. In particular, if
realized volatility at time t is below the 25th percentile of the volatility distribution
for the full sample, then period t is in a low- volatility regime. If realized volatility
is above the 75th percentile, then period t is in a high volatility regime. In this
way we assign one quarter of the days in the sample to the high volatility state and
one quarter of the sample to the low volatility state. Table 2 shows the very strong
11

dependency on carry returns on volatility. In the low volatility states, subsequent
returns are much higher than in high volatility states. Indeed for both the 1 v 1.,.2 v
2.,3 v 3. portfolios the average carry return is negative in the high volatility regimes.
We also experimented with changing the threshold levels of volatility that de…nes
high and low volatility regimes and found the results to be consistent across a wide
range of threshold levels. The results are in other words robust to changes in the
threshold. For this reason, we keep the threshold …xed at the 25th/75th percentile
throughout this paper.

Table (2) reports summary statistics for the 5 FX portfolios for the sub samples split into high volatility and low
volatility states. Daily data.

In fact the average return is minus 9.75 percent (annualized) for the quarter of
the sample period that belong to the high volatility regime for the 1 v 1 portfolio.
In contrast, the corresponding average return for the low volatility regime is 13.61
12

percent. In this particular case however, the inclusion/exclusion of JPY and USD
from the currency universe is important. This re‡ects the large; rapid unwinds of
the yen funded carry trade during several episodes. These unwinds can be clearly
identi…ed in …gure (1b) above.
To be robust against model misspeci…cation and potential non-linearities, we also
estimate non-parametric relationships between realized volatility and FX returns using kernel regressions(see appendix for a description). We construct boot-strapped
standard errors and associated con…dence intervals by re-sampling from the distribution of residuals. The results are shown in …gure (3) and con…rms the empirical
relationship between volatility and returns.

We next investigate the link between carry trade returns and implied exchange
rate volatility from option prices, using a dataset obtained from Citibank. This
dataset contains spot rates, implied volatilities and traded option prices for at-themoney strikes with 1 month maturities on all G10 crosses against the USD daily from
October 1 1996 to 14 January 2009. Using this dataset we can back out the implied
interest rate di¤erential from the current spot and negotiated strike (the forward
rate) from these options using covered interest parity :
iFt

(5)

iUt S =

(ft

xt )

where iFt
iUt S is the implied interest di¤erential between the foreign country and
the US, ft is the (log) forward exchange rate and xt is the (log) spot exchange rate
in units of US currency pr. foreign currency.

Figure 4: Panel kernel regression of realized carry returns on the change in implied volatilities.

The Citibank dataset suggests that there is a tight link between changes in BlackScholes implied volatilities and average returns on the carry trade strategy. Increases
15

in implied volatility lead, on average, to lower returns on the carry trade, with the
kernel regression identifying a strong relationship as shown in …gure (4). Likewise,
in a nearly symmetric fashion, declines in implied volatility are associated with an
appreciation of the high carry currency against the low carry currency. The …gure leaves a striking impression as it highlights the way changes in forward looking
volatilities from the option market are contemporaneously associated with returns
from the carry trade.
We …nally estimate exponential Garch models (Nelson (1991) of returns on carry
trade baskets using weekly data, where the volatility of returns is dominated by
exchange rate volatility. Speci…cally, we estimate models of the form,
(6)

rt =

+ rt

1

+ ht + ut

where rt is the return on a basket of carry trades and ht is the conditional variance
of ut based on t –1 information. We assume ht obeys

(7)

log ht = c + a jut 1 j ht

1=2
1

+ b log ht

1

+ dut 1 ht

1=2
1

A special case is d = 0, in which case the model is symmetric. A value d < 0
implies that lagged negative returns on the carry trade are associated with a larger
increase in conditional volatility than are lagged positive returns. The models are
estimated with maximum likelihood for the 4 long v 4 short basket excluding the
USD and JPY as well as for the USDJPY basket separately. We estimate both the
symmetric version of the E-Garch model (with d = 0) as well as versions that allow for
asymmetry. Motivated by our results for implied volatility, we also estimate a more
general model that allows for the change in conditional volatility to be negatively
correlated with carry trade returns.

The results are shown in Table (2b) on the next page, and they provide a compelling con…rmation of our …ndings above. An increase in the conditional volatility
of exchange rates (based on time t -1 information) in the basket is associated with
a decline in the expected return on the carry trade. Moreover, we can’t reject the
hypothesis that
1 = 2 , so it is the change in conditional volatility that accounts
for the predictable component of carry trade returns.

Revisiting the Fama Regression

The most popular method to assess whether uncovered interest parity holds has been
to estimate the following regression,
(9)

xt+1 =

+ ftH + "t =

+ (iH
t

iLt ) + "t

Again xt ; is the log of the spot exchange rate. UIP or no forward bias implies that
= 1: As reported by Froot (1992) and con…rmed by Burnside et. al. (2007) the
average estimate for is -0.85 across the countless studies that focus on this equation. It is therefore useful to restate our …ndings in the context of this regression.
We then run one-month versions of regression (3) for these two subsamples as well
as the full sample. The results are reported in Table 3. As implied by the equal
weighted portfolios we use in this section, the average yield di¤erence across the 3 v
3 portfolio is used in place of the interest di¤erential; and the equal weighted depreciation of the high yielding basket against the currencies in the low yielding basket
is used. Inspection of Table 3 reveals that the estimated coe¢ cient on the interest
19

di¤erential changes from being signi…cant and very negative for the low volatility
state to signi…cant and very positive in the high volatility state. In accordance with
the previous studies the sign for the whole sample period is negative.
These results are consistent with the analysis above. The negative estimate for
in low volatility environments implies enhanced returns from carry strategies in low
volatility states, whereas the positive coe¢ cient in high volatility environments is
consistent with potentially very negative returns to the carry trade in high volatility
states.

Table 4. Fama Regression for 1 month holding period conditional on implied 1 month volatility. Low volatility
regime is 25th percentile. High volatility regime is 75th percentile.

Next we look at the Fama regression conditioning on the level of implied volatility in each of the G10 currency crosses with the dollar, using the matched dataset
20

of carry returns and implied ATM 1 month volatility from Citigroup. We regress 1
month log changes in spot rate on the lagged 1 month interest rate di¤erential. The
low volatility regime is de…ned as any period where implied volatility from options
are below their 25th percentile as measured over the whole sample for each particular
cross. Similarly, the high volatility regime is de…ned by being above the 75th percentile. The Fama regression results are consistent with those documented from the
Bloomberg dataset using realized volatility. The unconditional regression displays a
clear violation of UIP. In accordance with the
estimates obtained in the previous
section that were based on realized volatility, these coe¢ cients show a clear pattern
when conditioning on the level of implied volatility. In low volatility environments
the high yielding currency tends to appreciate, resulting in a large violation of UIP
during low volatility episodes and large pro…ts to the carry trade. In high volatility
environments the low yielding currency tends to appreciate much more than implied
by uncovered interest parity(coe¢ cient far greater than 1) causing large negative
returns to the carry trade strategy as the short position in the low yielding currency
result in losses.

Empirical Relationship between Currency and
Yield Curve Factors: Interpreting the Current
Financial Crisis

We have already established that FX volatility is a major determinant of carry returns. In this section we relate currency carry returns to movements in key risk
factors that have been found to be important in pricing yield curves and credit
spreads. Toward this end, we examine simple, reduced form regression models on
the form,

(10)

returnt = (i

H

L

i )+

K
X

s

fst + "t

s=1

where f is a vector of risk factors and 0 s are loadings on these risk factors, that
may vary over time or over di¤erent regimes. To anticipate our main results, we
document the existence of an intuitive and signi…cant co-movement between currency
risk premium and the ‘level’and ‘slope’factors that drive bond yields in the countries
that comprise carry trade pairs. Campbell and Clarida (1987) were among the …rst
to model theoretically and empirically the joint determination of yield curve term
premia and carry trade risk premia, but for a variety of reasons, since then the yield
curve literature has increasingly become divorced from the currency risk premium
literature. We aim for a reconciliation and indeed are able to show that relative
yield curve level factors are positively correlated with carry trade excess returns
while relative yield curve slope factors are negatively correlated with carry trade
excess returns. Moreover, we show that this correlation is robust to the current crisis
and to the inclusion of equity volatility in the model. What distinguishes carry trade
returns in the current crisis from non crisis periods is not changed loading on yield
curve factors but a much larger loading on the equity factor. It should be explicitly
noted, that we do not attempt to separate movements in yields due to time varying
risk premium from pure expectations components of the changes in yields in the

22

present analysis. There is no question that this is highly desirable from a theoretical
point of view and it is an important task for future work. However, we simply
view our results as an encouraging starting point for such further work on a full
‡edged estimation/formulation of a structural asset pricing model that generates an
internally consistent, joint process for endogenous currency- and yield curve excess
returns.

VIX(percent)

R-square

Note: VIX is percentage change in the US implied volatility index. 'Yield Curve Levels" and "Yield Curve Slopes"
refers to relative change in levels and slopes in high yield currency country relative to low yield currency.
Level is defined as the 10 year treasury yield and slope is defined as 10 year minus 2 year treasury yield.

Since our ultimate goal is to relate carry returns to movements in yield curves and
general risk premia, we choose to include the VIX, the respective yield curve slopes
and the yield curve levels in the regression. The VIX is often used as a measure of
23

global investors risk aversion and has been shown in a number of studies to be an
observable proxy for an important factor that drives investment grade credit spreads
and EM debt returns. Table (5) compares the loadings on the three sets of risk
factors in the current crisis with the loadings obtained for the 1997-1998 period as
well as the period in between 1999 and 2007.

Yield Curve, Equity Factors and Realized Returns to Carry Trades

Several conclusions seem to be warranted based on the empirical evidence presented
in Table (5). First, when we compare the non-crisis period and the latest episode, we
observe that the loadings on the relative yield curve factors as well as the VIX remain
signi…cant across the board with the same respective signs, but also that the loadings
increased dramatically for the VIX in the crisis period, while the loading on the yield
curve factors are little a¤ected. The VIX has a signi…cantly negative coe¢ cient in
the regression, which implies that a spike in the VIX tends to be associated with
depreciation of the high yielding currency and a lower carry return. An increase
in the ‘level’ factor in the high interest rate country relative to the level factor in
the low interest rate country is positively correlated with carry trade returns within
the same week. This has an intuitive interpretation. Research has shown the level
factor to be a proxy for persistent movements in real interest rates and/ or in‡ation
(depending on the sample period) which result in parallel shifts in the yield curve.
When expectation of in‡ation rise, a credible in‡ation targeting central bank will be
expected to raise the time path of short term interest rates, shifting up the entire
yield curve and also, as shown in Clarida, Gali, Gertler (2002) and Clarida and
Waldman (2008) appreciating the nominal exchange rate. By contrast, an increase
in the slope factor in the high interest rate country relative to the slope factor in
the low interest rate country is negatively correlated with carry trade returns within
the same week. This again has an intuitive interpretation. Research has shown the
slope factor to be a proxy for the business cycle , with the yield curve getting steeper
24

(because of an easing of monetary policy) during an expected economic contraction
and with the yield curve getting ‡atter (because of a tightening of monetary policy)
in an expected economic expansion.
Note that the 1997-98 crisis period that encompasses the global turmoil that
followed in the wake of the Asian …nancial crisis as well as the Long Term Capital
Management meltdown, looks very di¤erent from both the full sample and the most
recent crisis. It is not possible to span the returns during the 97-98 crisis with the
same risk factors that seems to ’drive’the behavior of the exchange rate in the current
crisis.

As another way to assess the current crisis in light of previous unwinds of the currency
carry trades, we regress the returns on the yen dollar carry trade against the returns
on 4 long 4 short portfolio excluding the yen and the dollar. From Figure 1(b)
we see that in both magnitude and timing, the current unwind of the yen/dollar
carry trade is very typical of previous unwinds in 1994, 1998, and 2002. Regression
results con…rm that this episode is not statistically unusual conditional on the realized
returns on from a carry trade basket that excludes the yen and the dollar. Figure
5 plots the residuals from a regression of realized weekly returns on the yen/dollar
carry trade on realized returns on the 4 v 4 basket excluding the yen and dollar. The
25

correlation in weekly returns is 0.27 and the slope coe¢ cient is 0.46 with a highly
signi…cant t-statistic of 8.14.
We end this section by pointing to a couple of potential caveats in the part of our
analysis that pertains to the most recent episode in 2007-2008. Baba & Packer
(2008) document signi…cant deviations from covered interest parity in the recent crisis
period. These deviations imply that the one-to-one correspondence between forward
premia- and interest rate di¤erentials broke down, yet we use these interchangeable
in our paper. Similarly there is empirical evidence of under-reporting of US Libor
rates which may also a¤ect our results. We acknowledge that these issues might
raise some concerns about the robustness of the …ndings in this section, but have not
explored this further.

Concluding Remarks

In this paper we have examined the factors that can account for the returns on
currency carry trade strategies. Drawing on previous work by Bhansali (2007) we
documented a robust empirical relationship between carry trade excess returns and
exchange rate volatility, both realized and implied, and showed this result is robust
to exclusion of the yen which for virtually our entire 18 year sample has been a
funding currency for carry trade strategies. We next documented signi…cant volatility
regime sensitivity for Fama regressions estimated over low and high volatility periods.
Speci…cally we found that the well known result that a regression of the realized
exchange rate depreciation on the lagged interest rate di¤erential produces a negative
slope coe¢ cient (instead of unity as predicted by uncovered interest parity) is an
artifact of the volatility regime: when volatility is in the top quartile, the Fama
regression produces a positive coe¢ cient that is greater than unity. The third section
of the paper documented the existence of an intuitive and signi…cant co-movement
between currency risk premium and risk premia in yield curve factors that drive
bond yields in the countries that comprise carry trade pairs. We showed that yield
curve level factors are positively correlated with carry trade excess returns while
yield curve slope factors are negatively correlated with carry trade excess returns.
Importantly, we show that this correlation is robust to the current crisis and to the
inclusion of equity volatility in the model. What distinguishes carry trade returns
in the current crisis from non crisis periods is not changed loading on yield curve
factors but a much larger loading on the equity factor.
Our future research agenda is focused on developing an asset pricing model that
can account for these results. More broadly, we believe that too much attention has
been devoted to the fact that carry trade returns are di¢ cult to relate to observed
macro factors like consumption growth or Fama –French equity factors. While this
may be true, it is potentially misleading because it ignores the fact that currency
carry returns are related(and robustly so) to yield curve factors which in turn do have
an intuitive macro economic interpretation in terms of modern monetary policy and
exchange rate research. Finally, given the widespread …nding that US equity volatil27

ity is a proxy for an important factor in pricing not only equities, but also investment
grade bonds and emerging market credits, the tight link we …nd between carry returns and the VIX is also supportive of a fundamental explanation for currency risk
premia.

Appendix. Kernel Smoothing Regression

In a nonparametric regression, the conditional expectation of a variable Y relative
to a variable X may be written
E [Y jX] = m(X)
The Nadaraya (1964) and Watson (1964) approach is to estimate m as a locally
weighted average using the kernel K as a weighting function
Pn

i=1 Kh (x

where K is the Gaussian kernel

and h is the optimal bandwidth suggested by Bowman and Azzalini (1997). The
standard errors are obtained via bootstrap as follows. First we back out the implied
nonparametric residual for each of our observations
u i = Yi

E [Y jXi ]

Then we construct a set of pseudo-observations as follows
Yei = m(X
b i) + u
e

where u
e is a randomly drawn member from the set of regression residuals ui : Based
on these new observations we calculate another estimator of the mean m(X
e i ): The
standard error is then simply the sample standard deviation of these resampled mean
statistics.
