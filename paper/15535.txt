Intended and Unintended Consequences of Prison Reform

JEL No. H7,I18,I3,K0
ABSTRACT
Since the 1970s, U.S. federal courts have issued court orders condemning state prison crowding. However,
the impact of these court orders on prison spending and prison conditions is theoretically ambiguous
because it is unclear if these court orders are enforceable. We examine states' responses to court interventions
and show that these interventions generate higher per inmate incarceration costs, lower inmate mortality
rates, and a reduction in prisoners per capita. If states seek to minimize the cost of crime through deterrence,
an increase in prison costs should lead states to shift resources from corrections to other means of deterring
crime such as welfare and education spending.
However, we find that court interventions, that are associated with higher corrections expenditures,
lead to lower welfare expenditures. This suggests that the burden of increased correctional spending
is borne by the poor. Furthermore, states do not increase welfare spending after their release from
court order; making the reduction in welfare spending permanent. Thus, our results suggest that states
do not respond to prison reform in the manner prescribed by the deterrence model. States' responses
to prison reform are most consistent with the predictions in the empirical public finance literature that
indicate stickiness in expenditure categories and that increases in spending in programs that affect
the poor generate declines in expenditures in other program that are also targeted to the poor.

Introduction

The United States federal courts have ordered state officials to improve various dimensions of the operations of schools, prisons, and mental hospitals. However, the
enforceability of these court orders is limited by the Eleventh Amendment of the U.S.
constitution which provides states with immunity in federal court.1 To get around
the Eleventh Amendment, federal cases name specific state officials as defendants,
rather than the state, but it is difficult to enforce court orders that require additional
spending against state officials since most state constitutions forbid disbursements
from the state treasury except by legislative appropriation (Hirschhorn, 1984). If
the state government is reluctant to appropriate the necessary funds to improve the
quality of the services provided by an institution (such as schools or prisons) the
federal court can respond by closing the institution, but judges may be unwilling to
take such drastic measures. Furthermore, orders to close institutions may be reversed
on appeal (Hirschhorn, 1984). Thus, it is unclear theoretically whether federal court
orders requiring additional state expenditures are enforceable.
The empirical evidence on the issue is ambiguous. For example, federal court
orders that aim to improve prison conditions have received significant attention, but
the extent to which these court orders increase correctional expenditures is disputed
(Harriman and Straussman, 1983; Taggart, 1989; and Fliter, 1996), although Levitt
(1996) shows that these court orders reduce prison population growth. Even if such
federal court orders were fully enforceable, their impact on the provision of the services
targeted by the court order as well as on other services provided by the states would
depend on how the states choose to finance the additional expenditures that would

emerge as a consequence of the court order.
A number of researchers have examined the federal court orders from a normative
perspective. For example, federal court orders to reform schools, prisons, and mental
institutions have been criticized as undemocratic (Sandler and Schoenbrod, 2004).
Others have pointed out that the state political process gives little weight to the
disadvantaged. For instance, prisoners’ rights are less likely to be protected by the
states since inmates are not allowed to vote. Thus, it has been argued that federal
courts should be given authority over expenditures for the disadvantaged to balance
out the fact that the disadvantaged have little influence in the state political process
(Rose-Ackerman, 2003).
Although the intended consequence of federal court interventions is to enforce
the constitutional and statutory rights of disadvantaged groups, it is possible that
an unintended consequence is the decline in funds allocated to other disadvantaged
groups as a consequence of the additional expenditures that have to be incurred by
the states to comply with these court orders. A related example is the case of the U.S.
Congress which can force states to spend more on groups of individuals by making it a
condition to continue receiving federal grants (Rosenthal, 1987). Baicker (2001) finds
that federally-mandated increases in medicaid spending lead to increases in medicaid
spending at the expense of other state welfare spending. Similarly, Baicker and Gordon (2006) examine state Supreme Courts orders to equalize spending across school
districts. They find that these orders increase state aid to localities for education at
the expense of aid for public welfare, health, hospitals, and general services. Thus, if
federal court orders are enforceable, it is plausible that the resources used to satisfy
the court order come from other disadvantaged groups.
In this paper, we examine the impact of federal court orders to improve prison
conditions. Specifically, we investigate whether federal court orders did indeed im3

prove prison conditions, whether they impacted state expenditures on corrections,
and if and how states re-allocated resources in reaction to these court orders.
Since 1970, federal court interventions have affected such dimensions of prison operations as staffing, the amount of space per inmate, medical and mental health care,
food, hygiene, sanitation, disciplinary procedures, conditions in disciplinary segregation, exercise, fire safety, inmate classification, grievance policies, race discrimination,
sex discrimination, religious discrimination and accommodations, and disability discrimination and accommodations (Schlanger, 2006). In 1995, state attorneys general
successfully lobbied Congress to pass the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) so
that they could regain control over prisons (Wharton, 1996). The PLRA ended federal court supervision over several state correctional systems and made any further
court intervention more difficult (Schlanger, 2006). Sullivan (2000) reports the deterioration of Tennessee prisons after their release from federal court supervision.2
Nonetheless, federal courts still order states to increase state correctional expenditures. For instance, a panel of federal judges just ordered the California prison system
to drastically increase prison expenditures or reduce its inmate population by 150,000
within two years (Moore, 2009).
We find that following federal court orders, prison conditions improved, prison
costs per inmate increased, and per capita spending on welfare decreased. Thus, our
results suggest that federal court can increase state expenditures but that it is likely
that the resources used to finance these additional expenditures come from other disadvantaged groups. Our results follow from a difference-in-differences methodology.
Thus, our results denote changes relative to a comparison group of states. For instance, welfare expenditures may have increased following a court order but not as

Specifically, Wharton (1996) underlines the decrease in the correctional staff and increase in
the number of violations of regulations governing mental health, fire safety, occupational safety, and
hazardous materials.

much as welfare expenditures in the control group of states.
Federal court orders to improve prison conditions are expected to reduce the deterrent effect of imprisonment,3 and a large literature suggests that outlays on social
welfare and education are substitutes for corrections in combating crime.4 Thus, if
states seek to deter crime, we expect an increase in state spending on social welfare
and/or education following federal court intervention.
Contrary to our expectation we find the court orders, which are associated with an
increase in correctional spending, did not alter education spending, but generated a
decrease in welfare spending. We provide two related explanations for these findings.
First, it is possible that spending in various budget categories is “sticky.” Following
a court order to improve prison conditions, per capita corrections expenditures go
up despite the decline in inmates per capita. If states experience higher crimes rates
following a short-run reduction in the prison population, it may be infeasible to
maintain a lower imprisonment rate. In general it may be difficult for the state
to change the long-run level of the imprisonment rate given that it is affected by
the decision of so many independent parties (state legislature, police, prosecutors,
judge, juries, parole boards, and probation officers). If expenditures on corrections
are “sticky,” corrections expenditures will remain at a higher level even after the state
has had enough time to adjust. Thus, given the budget constraints faced by the state,
3

This is because, we find evidence in this paper that court intervention reduces prison deaths,
and Katz et al. (2003) show that a reduction in prison death rates leads to higher crime rates. Thus,
an improvement in prison conditions through court intervention implies a reduction in deterrence.
Furthermore, we document in this paper that court orders reduce per capita prisoners in the state.
Levitt (1996) shows that court orders impact the growth of prison population, which in turn influences the crime rate. Thus, the reduction in prison population due to court intervention is another
avenue through which the court interventions may have reduced deterrence.
4
For instance, Donohue and Siegelman (1998) argue for the effectiveness of preschool and early
childhood education, family-based therapy, and job training as a crime control device. Corman and
Mocan (2000, 2005), Mocan and Bali (forthcoming), Gould et al. (2002) and Lin (2008) provide
evidence that local unemployment, wages and poverty have an impact on criminal activity, implying
that education and training help combat crime. Lochner and Morettti (2004) demonstrate the
impact of education on criminal activity.

5

a permanent increase in corrections expenditures would have a negative impact on
the provision of all services, including welfare services. Second, policy makers may
consider expenditures on various programs that affect the poor as substitutes. Given
that court orders increase the cost of punishing criminals, to the extent that policy
makers perceive criminals as being members of low-income groups, they may decide
to decrease in welfare payments, rather than to reduce other spending items, such as
transportation.5
Section 2 discusses prison litigation. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4
explains our empirical methodology and Section 5 presents the results.

Prison litigation
Background and prior research

Prior to the 1960s federal and state courts almost invariably refused to hear cases
regarding prison conditions (Bleich 1989; Schlanger 1999). In 1963, the Supreme
Court held that inmates could employ the writ of habeas corpus to contest their
conditions of incarceration.6 During the mid to late 1960s, courts intervened on
narrow issues. For instance, the courts prohibited guards from using two torture
devices on prisoners (the crank telephone and the teeter board) and “the application
of any whipping to the bare skin of prisoners.”7 In the 1970s, the federal courts
took a much more activist stand. The prison systems in several states were ruled
5
Baicker (2001) finds that federally-mandated increases in medicaid spending lead to increases in
medicaid spending at the expense of other state welfare spending. Further, she finds the effect to be
larger with greater racial differences. Similarly, Baicker and Gordon (2006) examines state Supreme
Courts orders to equalize spending across school districts. They find that these orders increase state
aid to localities for education at the expense of aid for public welfare, health, hospitals, and general
services. Court order to spend additional resources on prisons have occurred in some of the states
with the greatest racial differences. Thus, if federal court orders are enforceable, it is plausible that
the resources used to satisfy the court order come from other disadvantaged groups.

unconstitutional, and the courts enacted sweeping remedies based on the totality of
prison conditions. Federal court intervention narrowed in scope in the 1980s. As
described by Fliter (1996) and Schlanger (2006), this could be because the lawsuits in
the 1970s made states more aware of legal liabilities, and many states created dispute
resolution mechanisms to address grievances; and it could also be due the appointment
of conservative judges to the federal bench by Republican administrations (Schlanger,
2006; Epstein et al., 2007). Finally, in 1995 Congress passed the Prison Litigation
Reform Act which made existing court orders harder to sustain and new ones harder
to obtain (Schlanger, 2006).
Three previous studies have examined the impact of court orders on prison conditions. Harriman and Straussman (1983), Taggart (1989) and Fliter (1996) provide
contradictory evidence on whether court orders have influenced state spending on
correctional facilities. These studies limited their analyzes to total corrections expenditures and thus did not examine the impact of federal intervention on the number
of state prisoners, corrections expenditures per prisoner, or corrections expenditures
per capita. Further, these earlier studies did not employ panel data, and instead
examined corrections expenditures one state at the time, for the states in which the
federal courts intervened. Thus, the observed increase in corrections expenditures in
the litigated states may have been caused by overall national trends in corrections expenditures. In contrast, Levitt (1996) examined a panel of all states for the years 1972
through 1993 and court orders that span the years 1971 through 1992. He reported
that prison litigation had a short-run effect on the growth rate of prison population.8
8

Our paper is also related to Murray, Evans and Schwab (1998), who analyze the impact of state
education-finance reforms ordered by state courts on within-state inequality in education spending.

Data

Following Levitt (1996), we consider a state under court order if all correctional
facilities of the state came under court order. These “Litigated States” and the
date in which the state’s correctional system came under court order, and the date
of release are displayed in Table 1. We used the information at the Civil Rights
Litigation Clearinghouse to reconcile the small discrepancies in year and litigated
status among the prior studies (Taggart, 1989; Fliter, 1996; Levitt, 1996).9
We investigate the impact of court orders on prison spending, prison mortality,
welfare expenditures, education expenditures, transportation expenditures, state and
local police expenditures as well as local jail expenditures. We define welfare expenditures as all state expenditures on cash assistance to individuals, and other welfare payments. Cash assistance to individuals includes AFDC/TANF and assistance
programs not under federal categorical programs (e.g., general assistance, refugee
assistance, home relief, and emergency relief). Other welfare payments include the
administration of medical and cash assistance, general relief, vendor, nursing homes
and welfare institutions owned and operated by a government, and other welfare programs. With one exception, all welfare data are obtained from the Bureau of the
Census. The measure for vendor payments from the Bureau of the Census does not
include payments to public hospitals. For this reason, vendor payments data are
obtained from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
Because we are interested in the effect of court intervention on the yearly cost
of incarceration, we examine corrections operating expenditures.10 We also analyze

from court order is obtained from “U.S. Relinquishes Alabama Prisons; Dismissing 17-Year Lawsuit,”

In 1992, more than three-quarters of the operating expenditures went to labor compensation

services, and the like. (Alexis M. Herman and Katharine G. Abraham, Measuring State and Local

variables are obtained from U.S. Census Bureau, Annual Survey of State Government
Finances and Census of Governments. All financial variables are converted in real
(2007) dollars using the consumer price index.
We follow Katz, Levitt, and Shustorovich (2003) in using prison deaths as a proxy
for prison conditions. Courts have used prison deaths as a proxy for prison conditions
as recently as February 2009, when federal judges found prison conditions in California
so poor that inmates die regularly of suicides and lock of proper care (Thompson,
2009).11 The prison mortality rate is computed as prison deaths per 1,000 state
prisoners. Because of data limitations, the prison mortality is not adjusted for age,
gender, or race of prisoners. Data on prison population and prison deaths are obtained
from Donohue and Wolfers (2005), and updated using data from the Bureau of Justice
Statistics.12
We also control for real income per capita, the proportion of female-headed households, the poverty rate, state unemployment rate, percentage of the state population
that is black, percentage of the state population residing in urban areas, and variables
gauging the age distribution in the state. Income per capita data are obtained from
the Bureau of Economic Analysis. We followed Berry, Fording and Hanson (2003)
methodology to calculate the proportion of female-headed households in each state
until the year 2000. We used the poverty rate data reported by the same authors for
the period of 1960-1990 and the data provided by the census for the period 1980-2007
to create a consistent poverty rate series.13 The unemployment rate is defined as

1998.)

In response to these conditions the court ruled that California must release tens of thousand of
inmates to relive overcrowding.

the insured unemployment rate.14 State-and-year specific age and race distribution is
calculated using information from the Center for Disease Control and the Bureau of
the Census. The proportion of state population residing in urban areas is calculated
using census data. Regressions also include a variable gauging the ideology of the
state’s citizens, created by Berry et al. (1998).15 A higher value of this index signifies
more liberal ideology.
Table 2 presents summary statistics for the years 1961 through 2000. The average
real spending is about $34,300 per prisoner for operating expenditures and $4,500 for
capital expenditures. Per capita state spending on welfare is $722. Average inmatepopulation ratio is 1.78 per 1,000 residents, and average prison death rate is 2.9 deaths
per 1,000 inmates, which translates into 27 deaths per year for the average state. On
average there are 0.1 inmates per 1,000 residents who are held in local jails (rather
than state prisons) due to prison overcrowding.

Empirical methodology

In Figure 1 we display the ratio of corrections expenditures in litigated states to
corrections expenditures in non-litigated states. To account for differences in wealth
among states, expenditures are normalized by state income per capita, and they are
deflated by the number of inmates and by the state population. The behavior of this
ratio as a function of the timing of the court order is informative. The horizontal
axis displays the time periods (in years) relative to the year in which the court order
was issued to the litigated state. For example, four years prior to the court order,
litigated states spent about 72% per inmate of what was spent by the non-litigated
14

The data for the years 1960-2000 are obtained from Donohue and Wolfers (2005). The values
for 2001-2006 are calculated using state-specific weekly unemployment insurance claims information
obtained from the U.S. Department of Labor.

states. When the time period is zero (the year in which the court order was issued)
the ratio jumps to about 87%; it reaches 102% two years after the court order and
levels off. Thus, Figure 1 suggests that court intervention leads to higher corrections
expenditures per inmate.

An ideal strategy to identify the impact of the court orders, however, would involve
randomly assigning court orders to states and observing the differences in outcomes
between states that received these court orders and states that did not. In fact, the
eight out of twelve litigated states are in the south and thus the assignment of court
orders is far from random. In the absence of such an experiment, we follow Angrist
11

and Lavy (2001), Ashenfelter and Card (1985), and Freeman (1984) in assuming that
while there are differences between states which received and did not receive court
orders, these differences are fixed over time (after controlling for income per capita).
Furthermore, the courts do not react to short-term variations in prison conditions
when imposing the court orders. Specifically, court orders are not issued in reaction
to transitory deteriorations in prison conditions; rather prison litigation and court
orders emerge in reaction to prison conditions that would remain dire if it were not
for court intervention. The graph in Figure 1 supports this statement. There is no
drop in per inmate corrections spending in litigated states relative to non-litigated
states before a court order was issued.16 Levitt (1996) provides evidence that states
start responding to prison litigation before the court decision, specifically they start
responding when the lawsuit is filed. The evidence in Figure 1 is consistent with this
hypothesis, as corrections operating expenses per inmate increase slightly before the
court order is imposed. Thus the difference in corrections expenditures per inmate
before an after the court order may somewhat underestimate the effect of the court
intervention.17
In this spirit, we utilize a difference-in-difference methodology to examine how
states react to court intervention. In particular, we investigate the impact of court
intervention on various outcomes described earlier by estimating reduced-form regressions depicted by Equation (1):
Yit = αi + βit + θt + δrp + γXit + η CourtOrderit +δ CourtOrderit × Post80 +εit , (1)
16

Put differently, there is no indication of an “Ashenfelter dip.”
Note that corrections operating expenditures per capita in litigated states (the dashed line in
Figure 1) remain steady in comparison to non-litigated states until one year after the court order
(period 1 on the horizontal axis), while corrections operating expenditures per inmate rise sharply
in the year in which the court order is handed out (period zero on the horizontal axis). This picture
is consistent with the empirical result we report below, which shows that prisoners per capita in
the state declines in reaction to a court order. It seems to indicate that the immediate reaction of
the state to a court order is to adjust the prison population, while a budget increase in corrections
spending takes a year to implement, possibly because of the fiscal cycle of the state.
17

12

where the dependent variable Yit stands for corrections expenditures (operating, or
capital outlays) per prisoner, the death rate for prisoners, and prisoners per capita.
Because the prison death rate contains zero values, we added one to this variable.
These dependent variables are employed to investigate the impact of court orders
on corrections expenditures and prison conditions. To analyze the extent to which
states shift prisoners from state correctional facilities to local jails in reaction to
federal court orders, we employ per capita jail expenditures and per capita state prisoners held in local jails because of prison crowding as additional dependent variables.
Other dependent variables include per capita state general expenditures, per capita
welfare expenditures, per capita expenditures on corrections, per capita expenditures
on education, per capita transportation expenditures, and per capita expenditures
on other items (such as administrative expenditures). These individual expenditure
items comprise total state spending.
The vector Xit contains observable state characteristics as described in the data
section above; αi stands for unobserved state characteristic and θt represents year
effects. The models also contain state-specific time trends, represented by βit , and
region-period effects, represented by δrp . The regions consist of the nine census divisions, and the periods cover the four distinct periods described in Section 2 above:
before 1970, between 1970 and 1980, between 1980 and 1995, and post 1995. Nineteenseventy is the year of the first federal court order; 1980 is the year in which the justice
department changed its policy towards prison litigation (Schlanger, 2006); and 1995 is
the year in which Congress passed the Prison Litigation Reform Act. We also include
an interaction term between the percentage of black population and the poverty rate.
“CourtOrderit ” is an indicator variable which takes the value of one if state i is
under the court order in time t, and zero otherwise. “CourtOrder” can take the value
of one only in litigated states, but there is variation in exposure to the “treatment”
13

by a court order between litigated states; that is, in some states the court order remained effective for longer periods than others. For example, we see in Table 1 that
the duration of a court order was from 1975 to 1997 in Louisiana, but it was from
1970 to 1982 in Arkansas. We include an interaction term between CourtOrder and a
dummy variable which is equal to one in and after 1980 (Post80 ) to account for the potentially different impact of court orders after 1980. We expect Post80 × CourtOrder
to decrease corrections expenditures since it has been argued that court orders had
a smaller effect after the 1980s because of the narrowed scope of prison litigation in
the 1980s (Fliter, 1996; Schlanger, 2006). Because the percentage of female headed
households is available until 2000, Equation (1) is estimated for the years 1961-2000.
While the model depicted by Equation (1) analyzes the impact of a court order on
the outcomes of interest, another interesting aspect is the extent to which a release
from a court order influences the same outcomes. For example, while it is important
to investigate whether the imposition of a court order increases prison spending and
decreases spending on welfare programs, it is equally important to analyze if the effect
of a release from court order is symmetric. More specifically, Equation (2) below is
used to investigate the impact of a release, conditional on being under a court order:
Yit = κi + πit + τt + δrp + λXit + µ Releaseit +ωit ,

(2)

where Release is a dichotomous variable which takes the value of one in the year
during which the state was released from court order as well as in all years afterwards
until the end of the sample. Thus, the variable Release captures the “treatment
period” for the state, in which the “treatment” is the release from a court order. The
data on the proportion of female-headed households is available until 2000, but New
Hampshire and Texas were releases from court order in 2001 and 2002, respectively.
To include these events to the analysis we ran the models without female-headed
14

household variable, which created a sample that spans from 1972 to 2006.
Equation (2) is estimated in the sample of litigated states and in the years following
the initiation of a court order. More precisely, this sample includes all state-years after
a state came under the court order.18 For example, Table 1 shows that Alabama came
under court order in 1975. Therefore, the sample includes the observations from
Alabama in years 1975 and later. The same argument applies to the other states
listed in Table 1. Thus, Equation (2) investigates whether the release from the court
order had an impact on outcomes (conditional on being under the court order).

Results

Table 3–A displays the results obtained by estimating Equation (1). The variables
are in logarithms. All models include state fixed-effects, time dummies, state-specific
trends and region-period effects. Robust standard errors are clustered at the state
level. The results reported in Column (1) indicate that, following the court intervention, corrections operating expenditures per prisoner increase by about 25%.19 Column (2) displays the results obtained from the model where the dependent variable
is correctional capital outlays per prisoner. The estimated coefficient of CourtOrder
indicates that being under the court order generates an increase in per inmate correctional capital outlays by 150% following the court intervention. These estimates
imply that corrections operating and capital expenditures go up by $147 million for
an average state. Court orders decrease the prison death rate by 20% as shown in column (3), which translates into about 6 fewer deaths per year for an average state. The
result in column (4) indicates that court orders generate a 16% decline in prisoners
per capita.
18

This specification does not include an interaction term with Post80 because no state was released
from a court order prior to 1980.
19
The percentage impact is calculated as exp{β − 12 × V ar(β)} − 1, see Kennedy (1981).

15

The coefficient of CourtOrder × Post80 (δ) is of the opposite sign of CourtOrder
(η) in all regressions with the exception of jail expenditures. We cannot reject the
hypothesis that the sum of η and δ is zero in case of corrections capital expenditures
and prison deaths. This result suggests that while court orders increased capital
expenditures and reduced prison deaths prior to 1980, court orders had no significant
impact on these outcomes after 1980. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis
that post-1980, court orders had were narrowed in scope (Fliter, 1996; Schlanger,
2006). On the other hand, the sum of η and δ is negative and significantly different
from zero for inmates per capita (p=0.08), indicating that court orders had a smaller
but still statistically significant impact on prison crowding after 1980. The impact of
the court orders on operating expenses (column 1) is the same in pre- and post-1980
periods, indicating that court orders increased corrections operating expenditures
throughout the entire period of analysis.
A potential reaction of states to court orders could be for states to shift the prison
population to local jails. Columns (5) and (6) of Table 3–A display the results where
per capita jail expenditures and per capita state prisoners who are held in local jails
due to overcrowding are used as dependent variables. In neither case we detect a
statistically significant impact of the “CourtOrder,” indicating that jail populations
do not change in reaction to court orders.
Given that court orders decrease prison population and improve prison conditions,
as revealed by a decline in prison deaths and prison population, court orders effectively
reduce deterrence.20 As described in the introduction, welfare spending may be a tool
for short-term crime prevention as a substitute for other deterrence measures such as
imprisonment and prison conditions. Spending on education is another potential but
20

In fact, Levitt (1996) has shown that the decrease in prison population due to court orders had
a significant impact on state crime rates.

16

longer-term vehicle through which crime commission can be influenced. Therefore, we
examine whether the increase in the cost of punishing criminals was associated with
an increase in welfare spending or education spending. More generally, we investigate
whether states re-allocate resources following the court orders.
Table 3–B displays the result of the models where per capita state expenditures
(in column 1) and various spending categories of the state (columns 2–6) are the
dependent variables. These spending categories exhaust total state expenditures.

21

Column (1) of Table 3–B indicates that court orders have no impact on per capita
general state spending. Consistent with the results reported in Table 3–A, column (2)
shows that court orders increase per capita correctional spending by 14 %. In column
(3) the coefficient of CourtOrder is negative and statistically significant, indicating the
unintended consequence of reducing welfare spending: court orders generate about a
8% reduction in per capita welfare spending. Columns (4) through (6) demonstrate
that court orders have no impact on transportation spending, education spending, or
other state spending.
Taken together, the results displayed in Tables 3–A and 3–B demonstrate that
court orders improved prison conditions, and they increased the cost of providing
correctional services. In reaction, states decreased the resources allocated to welfare
spending. During our period of study (1961 through 2000), there were numerous
changes in the federal rules that determine welfare. Thus, we may be concerned
that our results are driven by correlation between prison litigation and changes in
federal welfare rules. This scenario is unlikely since we provide evidence that in
response to court intervention, states did not increase total expenditures and they
did not decrease expenditures in any other category other than welfare. Nonetheless,
21

Average per capita state general expenditures is $2,760. Average per capita state spending on
education is $1,023. It is $722 for welfare, $395 for transportation, $134 for correctional spending
and $558 for other items, such as administration.

17

to investigate if the impact of court orders on state welfare spending is sensitive to
model specification, we estimate a variety of models for welfare spending and report
the results in Table 3–C. For example, the specification in the first column of Table
3–C is the same specification reported in column (3) of Table 3–B, but we drop the
interaction term of the CourtOrder and the Post-1980 dummy. The model in column
(2) is the same as in column (1), but we exclude the region-period interactions. The
point estimates in Table 3–C vary from -0.06 to -0.09, but in each specification the
impact of CourtOrder on welfare spending is negative and statistically significant,
demonstrating that court orders prompted the states to reduce their spending on
welfare.
As a further check of the validity of the identification strategy, we investigate
the impact of exposure to court orders on the different facets of the criminal justice
system; police spending and jail spending. Specifically, we examine the impact of
court orders on the difference between state correctional operating expenditures per
prison inmate and (i) police expenditures per arrest, and (ii) jail expenditures per
jail inmate. If corrections expenditures and other criminal justice expenditures move
in tandem in states that are exposed to court orders as well as in states that are not
under the court order, this would imply that some unobserved factors confound the
impact of court orders on corrections spending. Put differently, if federal intervention
has an effect, the difference between corrections expenditures and other criminal
justice expenditures are expected to get larger in states that are exposed to court
orders. Thus, the difference-in-difference-in-differences estimates allow us to control
for unobserved factors that are not accounted for by state fixed effects, year fixed
effects, state specific time trends and region-period effects.
Table 4 displays the results of the model where the dependent variable is the difference between per inmate corrections spending and other correctional expenditures (in
18

logs, normalized by inmates, arrests, or population). The coefficient of CourtOrder
is positive and statistically significant, indicating that the wedge between corrections
operating expenditures and other correctional expenditures increased in states that
were exposed to court orders in comparison to those states that were not.
To investigate the impact of having been released from a court order, we estimated
models depicted by Equation (2). Tables 5–A and 5–B display the results. The sample
sizes are smaller in these specifications because they analyze the impact of having been
released from the court order, given that a court order was imposed. Because we have
only 12 states that contribute to this identification, clustered robust standard errors
underestimate standard errors. Thus, we follow Cameron, Gelbach and Miller (2008)
and provide bootstrapped p-values for the variable Release [in brackets]. Regardless
of whether we compute p-value using limiting p–values or bootstrap, welfare spending
does not increase when states are released from court order. Thus, the budget cuts
that are associated with welfare programs following the court order are not restored
after the state’s release from court order. Similarly, states do not alter per inmate
corrections spending when the court order is lifted, and prison deaths per inmate and
inmates per capita do not change when states are released from the court order.
To investigate the robustness of the results, we analyzed whether the results were
sensitive to the omission of Alaska and Hawaii. Alaska receives its tax revenues
from oil, which is a highly variable revenue source. Hawaii is also unusual as a large
percentage of its revenues comes from tourism. However, omitting these states did not
alter the results. We estimated the prison death equation using the level of (deaths
per 1,000 inmates) as the dependent variable, rather than its logarithm. About four
percent of the sample contained zeros for this variable. Estimating the prison death
rate regression in levels did not alter the results. The coefficient of CourtOrder was
estimated as −0.83 (p=0.028), indicating a reduction of about 8 deaths for an average
19

state, which is similar to the results obtained from the model with logarithms.

Conclusion

Although it is believed that the intervention of federal courts has improved the conditions in state prisons, very little systematic analysis is available on the impact of
court orders. The extent to which the federal court order are enforceable is disputed
(Fliter, 1996; Taggart, 1989; Harriman and Straussman 1983). Even if the court orders are fully enforceable, the response of states having to spend additional resources
on prisons depends on numerous factors such as the level of heterogeneity in the
population, the shape of the utility function of the median voter (Baicker, 2001), the
deadweight cost of taxes and subsidies (Becker and Mulligan, 2001), and the cost
of altering the provision of various government services. Therefore, theoretically, the
impact of federal court orders on prison spending and prison conditions is ambiguous.
Furthermore, there exists no research that investigates the reaction of states to federal
court orders in such dimensions as education spending and welfare expenditures.
In this paper we employ a state-level panel data set to investigate states’ reactions
to federal court interventions. Specifically, we analyze the impact of court orders on
prison spending, prison conditions, per capita prisoners, as well as state spending
on welfare, education, transportation, and other state spending. We find that court
intervention in state prisons increased per inmate operating expenditures by about
25%, increased per capita corrections capital expenditures by 150%, decreased prisoners per capita by 16 percent and prison mortality by 6 prisoner deaths per year for
an average state.
We also investigate the effect of the release from a court order, and we find no
evidence that when the court orders are lifted states adjust back their corrections
expenditures. Similarly, prison mortality rate does not change following the release
20

of the court order.
Because court orders make it more expensive for states to deter crime through
imprisonment, one could expect states to shift towards relatively cheaper means of
deterring crime. For example, given that spending on education and welfare programs
are expected to negatively impact criminal activity, states could spend more on these
budget items following the imposition of court orders. However, we find that following court orders, state expenditures on education, transportation, and other items
remained the same, but expenditures on welfare decreased by about 8%. In addition,
our results indicate that after the state has been released from court order, welfare
spending is not restored. The results follow from a difference-in-differences methodology. Thus, they denote changes that arise because of the exposure to a court order
relative to a group of comparison states. For instance, welfare expenditures may have
increased in all states, but the increase was smaller in states that were subject to
court order.
One explanation of these finding is that increases in expenditures in those programs that affect the poor trigger a decrease in expenditures in other programs that
also affect the poor. For instance, if state legislators believe that welfare recipients
and criminals come from the same social groups, then cutting welfare spending may
be considered a substitute to imprisonment in punishing criminals by the legislators.
Another explanation is that spending on expenditure categories is “sticky.” Hysteresis in welfare spending can emerge because the average duration of a court order is 18
years, and the governors and state legislators change during this period. Thus, it is
conceivable state legislators who are in office when the state is released from the court
order are not concerned with a budget re-allocation that took place years ago, long
before they were elected to office. Regardless of the mechanism that generates this
outcome, the findings underscore that states shift the burden of increased correctional
21

spending on the poor.
