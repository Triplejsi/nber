The Competitive Position of
U.S. Manufacturing Firms
ABSTRACT

This paper distinguishes between the competitive position of U.S.

firms

and that of the U.S. and other countries as geographical locations for pro-

duction. While the share of the U.S. in world exports of manufactures fell
more than 40 per cent between 1957 and 1977, the share of all TJ.S. firms

from all locations declined much less and the share of U.S. multinational
enterprises increased.

The comparative advantage of U.S. multinational firms, as measured by
the industry distribution of their exports from all locations, changed very
little between 1966 and 1977. At the same time, there were large shifts in the

comparative advantage of the parent firms in the U.S., their overseas affil-

iates, and foreign firms. The changes for the U.S. parents and their affiliates reflected differences among industries in the extent to which export

production shares moved from the U.S. to the affiliates' host countries. The

shift took place in all the industry groups but was largest for metals and chemicals and smallest for transport equipment.

The rise in the share of world exports accounted for by U.S.

firms

multinational

and the decline in the share of the U.S. as a geographical location

suggests that the search for causes of the changed position of the U.S. should
be directed not to deficiencies in American industrial or technological
leadership but to other price and cost determining influences, such as productivity, wage setting, taxation, domestic inflation, and exchange rates.

The Competitive Position of U.S. Manufacturing Firms

RESEARCH SUMMARY

Synopsis
Issues: What have been the changes in the competitiveness (share in
world exports) of U.S. firms in their worldwide activities, and
in their comparative advantage (distribution among industries)?
How do they compare with the competitiveness and comparative advantage of the U.S. as a geographical location and to those of
foreign firms?
If IJ.S.—owned and managed firms, including their operations

at home and abroad, have fared well in international competition,
while production facilities located in the TJ.S. have not, the

inference is that the deterioration of the U.S. position is due
to factors others than management or technology.

Results: While the share of the U.S. in world exports of manufactures
fell more than 40 per cent between 1957 and 1977, that of all
U.S. firms from all their locations around the world declined

much less and the share of U.S. multinationals increased. The
comparative advantage of U.S. multinational firms, as measured
by the industry distribution of their exports from all locations,

changed very little between 1966 and 1977, while there were substantial shifts in the distribution of exports from the U.S.,

—2from foreign affiliates of U.S.—firms, and from non-U.S. firms
in foreign countries. There was also a shift in export production, in terms of shares in total exports, from U.S. parents to
their foreign affiliates. This took place in all industry groups
but was largest in metals and chemicals.

The comparative advantage of foreign firms, as shown by the distribution of their exports, became more similar to that of U.S. multinationals.

That was particularly true in the developing countries, where the importance of food industries declined and that of machinery industries
increased.

Policy Implications
If, as we have hypothesized, the competitiveness and comparative advantage of U.S. firms reflects their managerial and technological abilities,
there is little indication here of any serious erosion of these advantages

or shifts in their industry distribution. This casts doubt upon explanations that attribute the U.S. trade deficit to unfavorable aspects of U.S.

management, such as an undue focus on short—term profits or lack of
measures that enlist the support of workers. It suggests that the search
for causes for the deterioration in the American position be sought in factors that determine relative U.S. prices as costs, such as monetary and
fiscal policy and wage and productivity behavior. For example, subsidies
to R & D or technological progress might produce gains in U.S.

multinationals' shares of world markets without affecting the extent of
production in the U.S.

Introduction
The decline in the U.S. shares of world exports and world manufactured goods exports since the 1950's has often been noted and commented on as

a measure of the declining competitiveness of the United States. While that
interpretation is questionable for a number of reasons (see Lipsey, 1984), we

will use the term here for convenience. Our main purpose in this paper is to
distinguish between the trade of the U.S. as a geographical location and the
trade of U.S. companies, wherever their production takes place, and to analyze the trends in these two aspects of U.S. competitiveness and comparative

advantage. While exports from the United States had declined by 1977 to less
than 15 per cent of world exports of manufactures, exports from all locations
by U.S. multinational firms accounted for more than 1/5 of the world total,
and exports by all U.S. firms for more than 1/4.1

Exports by American owned and managed firms thus fared well, while
exports from the territory of the U.S. did not. The implication is that the
deterioration of the U.S. position in world trade, at least for the decade
ending in 1977, was not due primarily to deficiencies in management, as is
sometimes claimed.

The share of world exports originating in the territory of the U.S.
reflects U.S. competitiveness, as determined by the characteristics of the
U.S. domestic economy. These include U.S. monetary and fiscal policy, through
effects on exchange rates and prices, and U.S. wage and productivity behavior.

The share of U.S. companies in world exports, on the other hand, is an

1The data on multinational firms are mainly from the 1957, 1966 and 1977
official surveys of U.S. multinational enterprises (U.S. Department of
Commerce, 1960, 1975 and 1981). To match the definitions used in these sur—
veys, the scope of "manufactures" in this paper includes manufactured foods
and edible oils but excludes manufactured fuels.

—2—
indicator of U.S. companies' competitiveness reflecting the firms' own
characteristics, such as their managerial and technological abilities and
skills. These can 'be exploited by U.S. companies by producing in the U.S. or
in foreign countries. A policy aimed at affecting TJ.S. domestic inflation or
exchange rates may affect the U.S. share of exports, while one aimed at technological advantage, such as subsidization of R & D, might have more
influence on the share of U.S. firms in world production, wherever it is
located, and the share of U.S. firms in world exports, wherever they are produced. This outcome would fit with the now common 'belief that it is the

existence of firm—specific assets, particularly knowledge, technology, and
management techniques, that account for much of the phenomenon of direct
investment.

We will refer in this paper to two characteristics of the U.S. and
of U.S. firms. One is their competitiveness, a term we will use, as mentioned

above, as shorthand for shares in world exports of manufactured goods. The
other is their comparative advantage, which we will use as shorthand for the
industry or commodity distribution of their exports, relative to those of
other companies or of the U.S. and other countries.

geographical entity, of U.S. firms, and of U.S. multinational firms in world

Further

Research

The story should be extended beyond 1977, but this must await the
availability of data from the 1982 census of U.S. direct foreign
Investment. It would also be desirable to examine the issue studied here in
terms of a more detailed breakdown than the broad industry divisions upon

which reliance has necessarily been placed in the present work. Such a
breakdown or, better still, access to individual company reports to the

Commerce Department would open the possibility of studying the effects of
R & D and of changes in technology upon export shares. Further insight into
the changes in competitiveness and comparative advantage could be obtained
from U.N. production data.

of exports by all market economies and by developed countries, frequently
cited as evidence of falling U.S. competitiveness, was more than 40 per cent
over the twenty years from 1957 to 1977, and was large in both halves of that
period (Lines 1 and 2). The share of 13.5.—owned firms, including operations
in the U.S. and overseas, also declined, but the change was much smaller,

only about half as large (Lines 3 through 6). The source of the difference
between the two sets of ratios is suggested by the figures for U.S. multinational enterprises (Lines 7 through 12), although most of them are available
only for 1966 and 1977. While the share of U.S. firms in world exports
declined, the share of U.S.—owned multinational enterprises remained constant

or increased slightly. That difference between the share of multinationals
and that of all U.S. firms could have reflected both the export performance
of firms that were already multinational in 1966 and the entry of additional
U.S. firms into status as multinationals. The sources of difference cannot be
precisely distinguished, but we have some indication that the latter element
was probably not the major one.3

3The number of manufacturing company parents recorded in 1977 (1,841) was
actually smaller than the nuniber of reporters recorded in 1966 (1,872). The
figures cannot be regarded as conclusive because the definition of a
reporter in 1966 was not identical to that of a parent in 1977, and it is
likely that some 1977 parents filed multiple reporter forms in 1966,
exaggerating the apparent decline in numbers of parents. However, the
number of such multiple reporters within firms was not large enough in 1966
to negate the implication that it was the greater success of multinational
firms in increasing exports rather than a tendency for more U.S. firms to
become multinational that accounted for the rise in the multinationals'
share in exports. Furthermore, there is other evidence for the relatively
greater export growth of multinationals. U.S. industries with high proportions of firms not investing abroad have tended to be those having severe
problems with import competition. And within industries, multinational
firms have tended to grow more rapidly than others. (Lipsey, Kravis, and
O'Connor, 1983).

—6—
For TEs we can distinguish between their exports from the U.S.
(parent exports) and their exports from foreign production locations. The

shares of parent company exports from the U.S. in world and developed—country
exports of manufactures (Lines 13 and 14) declined between 1966 and 1977, but

by much less than U.S. exports in general, as was clear from the increase in
parent companies' share of U.S. exports. What produced the constancy or small
gains mentioned above in U.S. multinationals' shares in world and developed—
country exports were the substantial increases in the shares of U.S.—owned
overseas affiliates in exports of countries other than the TJ.S., this in a

period when the exports of these countries were growing much faster than U.S.

exports. The shares of majority—owned affiliates in world exports rose from
about 6 per cent in 1957 to 91/2 per cent in 1977 (Line 16) and increased in
both developed— (Lines 17 and 21) and developing— (Lines 9 and 12) countries'

exports. The latter gain was particularly large, from less than 1 per cent in

1957 to over 5 per cent in 1977. If we include our rough estimates for
exports by minority—owned affiliates, which must also have reflected to some
degree the firm—specific advantages of the U.S. multinationals, the increases
were even larger between 1966 and 1977.

Another way of putting this development is that there was a large

shift in the geographical origins of exports by U.S. firms. For U.S. companies in general, the share of exports supplied by the overseas affiliates
of multinationals increased from 171/a percent in 1957 to over 40 per cent

(over 45 per cent including minority—owned affiliates) in 1977 (Lines 19

and 23). For the MEs, the share of their exports supplied from majority—
owned affiliates outside the U.S. rose from less than 40 per cent in
1966 to almost half in 1977 and the share from all affiliates reached over

half (Lines 18 and 22). Thus U.S. firms overcame some of the relative decline

-7in the competitiveness of the U.S. as a production location by shifting to
other countries the sites from which they exploited their firm—specific competitive advantages. Fxports of U.S. firms other than multinationals dropped
from 6.1 per cent of world exports in 1966 to 3.5

per

cent in 1977 (Line 2

minus Line i).

The Competitiveness and Comparative Advantages of U.S. Multinationals

The competitiveness of U.S.—owned multinational firms might be best
renresented by their shares in worldwide production and their comparative
advantage by

the

distribution of their production among various industries,

as compared with production by others. However, since production data are not
readily available on a comprehensive basis, we have relied on information
about shares in worldwide exports and exports of individual industry groups.

In assessing the role of U.S. multinationals, we examine separately
their exports from the U.S. compared with those of non—multinational U.S.
firms, their exports from other countries compared with those of non—U.S.

firms, and their worldwide exports compared with those of other U.S. and
foreign firms. The first comparison, between U.S. exports of multinational
(parent) and non—multinational firms, reflects the effects of multinationa—

lity. Worldwide production and distribution facilities may lead to an
increase in the firm's share of foreign markets, part of which may come

through exports from the United States of components or smaller—volume elements of a line of products. On the other hand, the multinational firm, even
if it has a comparative advantage in an industry, may substitute exports by

subsidiaries

in other countries for exports by the parent from the U.S.

These choices depend on location—specific rather than firm—specific advantages.

The second comparison, between exports of affiliates and those of

—8non—U.S. firms from foreign countries, should reflect the advantages of the
U.S. base for a company: the factors that make U.S. firms competitive with

foreign firms producing in the same location. This comparison should reflect
firm—specific competitiveness because location—specific influences have been
eliminated except for interactions between firm—specific and location—
specific factors.

The third comparison is between exports by U.S. multinational firms
from all locations and all other exports including those of non—multinational
firms from the U.S. and of non—U.S. firms from foreign countries. This should

give the best measure of U.S. firms' comparative advantage, because it eliminates from the comparison the effects not only of location—specific advantages themselves but also of any interactions between firm—specific and
location—specific advantages.

In making these three sets of comparisons we rely on data on the
exports of U.S. multinationals by country of origin from official surveys and
on U.N. export data for the U.S. and host countries which we have
reclassified to make reasonably comparable with the multinational export
data. The latter are available by country only for seven broad manufacturing
groups. We can, therefore, identify the comparative advantage of U.S. multinationals from export data only at this level and not, as would be desirable,
for a more detailed classification.

Exports from the U.S. by U.S. Multinationals and by Other U.S. Firms
The exports of non—multinational U.S. firms should reflect the competitiveness and the comparative advantages of the U.S. as a production location. Exports from the U.S. by U.S. multinationals (parent exports) reflect
the combination of the influence of the U.S. production location and of the
multinational nature of these firms. The distributions of exports by the two

—9-.
types of firms are compared in Table 2 in two ways. One is based on exports
classified by commodity group, the preferable way, since it is the basis for
classifying aggregate U.S. exports and should, therefore, give better estima—
tes for exports by non-multinational firms. The second is by industry group
of parent firm; this is the only comparison that can be made for 1966 as well
as 1977, and for this purpose we also calculate aggregate exports in such a
way that figures for the two years are comparable.

It is clear from the commodity—group classification that the largest
differences between multinational and other U.S. firms in 1977 were in the

shares in transport equipment and "other manufacturing" exports. Despite the
fact that motor vehicle companies (but not aircraft companies) were in one of
the most multinational of U.S. industries, in the sense of having the highest
share of its activity overseas, multinationals accounted for almost 85 per
cent of exports of transport equipment from the U.S., about 2/3 of which was

by motor vehicle and parts manufacturers. This is an industry in which
multinationals appear to have had an advantage relative to other firms in

exporting from the U.S. Almost all of the exports of motor vehicle companies
were of parts and components to their own overseas affiliates, while aircraft
exports were almost entirely to unaffiliated foreigners (Kulchycky and

Lipsey, 1984, Table 2). The other case of a large advantage for multinationals is machinery, also an industry in which a large part of companies'
activity tended to be overseas.
On the other side, in foods, chemicals, and other manufacturing,

especially the last, either multinationals did not have any advantage over
other U.S. firms in exporting from the U.S., or any such advantages were outweighed by the advantages of other locations from which they could export.
To observe changes in comparative advantage between 1966 and 1977,

we can use only the data by industry group.4 Between 1966 and 1977 there was

a general increase in the competitiveness of U.S. multinationals relative to
other U.S. firms, as shown by the increase in their share of U.S. exports.

This increase took place in every industry group, but it was substantial only

in chemicals and transport equipment. As can he seen from the industry
distribution of exports, there was an apparent decline in U.S. comparative
advantage in foods, chemicals, and particularly metals, shared by both multinationals and other firms. There was a gain in the comparative advantage of
multinational firms relative to non—multinational firms, in transport equipment and a shift toward machinery on the part of non—multinational firms.

Exports by U.S. Firms' Foreign Affiliates and their Host Countries
Further evidence on the competitiveness and comparative advantages
of U.S. multinationals is given by the comparison between exports by their
affiliates and exports by other firms in the same areas. The distribution of
exports from an area by both U.S. and other firms reflects the comparative
advantages of that area. The differences in distribution between U.S. affiliates and other firms reflect the comparative advantages of the U.S. firms
relative to others in that area. Finally, the shares of U.S. firms in exports
can be thought of as reflecting both the comparative advantages of U.S. firms
and their competitiveness relative to other firms. For example, U.S. firms
might account for a large part of exports of food products from an area or
country because of the superior marketing abilities of U.S. companies in
general, but the share of food products in U.S. firms' exports from that area
might be low relative to that of local firms because U.S. firms have no corn—

4mese suffer from a defect that makes them more suitable for observing
changes over time than for comparing the relative advantages of the two groups
of U.S. firms. The classification of parent exports by parent industry places a
substantial amount of exports under the wrong category for comparison with
aggregate IJ.S. export data. A notable example is that over 20 per cent of
exports by the transportation equipment industry are machinery, and over a
quarter of machinery exports are made by parent companies in other industries.

— 12 -

parative

advantage in that industry.

These calculations have been performed separately for several areas
because U.S. affiliates' relative competitiveness and comparative advantage
may differ among countries. The areas are Canada, developed countries other
than Canada, developing countries, and two groups of developing countries
that make up much of the set of countries often referred to as NICs, or newly
industrializing countries. The data for majority-owned and minority—owned
(where available) U.S. affiliates are summarized in Table 3.

Aside from Canada, where the ratios tend to be distorted by the
Canadian—U.S. Auto Agreement5, several results are common to most areas. U.S.
multinationals tend to have a comparative advantage in the machinery
industry. It is particularly large in developing areas, where it applies to
both electrical and non—electrical machinery, but exists in developed
countries also for the latter. U.S. firms also appeared to have comparative
advantages relative to local firms in chemicals and transport equipment in
the developed countries and the developing countries as a group, but not for
transport equipment in the Asian NIC's, where the other exporters probably
include many affiliates of Japanese auto companies.

At the other side of the scale, U.S. ME's did not seem to have any
comparative advantage over local and other foreign firms in the manufactured
foods and metals industries. That is not to say that no U.S. firms had such
advantages over local firms, since their presence in these countries implies

5The agreement encourages two—way trade between auto parents and their
affiliates, to a far larger extent than in other industries or countries. A
calculation using net exports for these companies, as an approximation to net
exports for these products, might give a more accurate picture of U.S. firms'
comparative advantage.

the presence of some firm—specific advantages. However, comparative advantages in foods and metals industries do not seem to be characteristic of U.S.
multinationals as a group.

The competitiveness of U.S. multinationals as a group is suggested
1w their shares in total manufactured exports. The shares grew in both developed and developing countries, but the most noteworthy increases were in the

latter. The U.S. firms' shares almost doubled despite the fact that tiese
countries' exports were increasing rapidly relative to those of other
countries. The data thus suggest that the U.S. affiliates probably played an
important role in these export expansions.

One of the major changes in comparative advantage that took place
between 1966 and 1977 was the shift toward machinery industries in developing
country exports. Both U.S. and non—U.S. firms moved strongly in this direction, but the change was larger for the U.S. firms, even in percentage terms,
despite their much higher initial levels. In developed countries, on the
other hand, the U.S. firms' comparative advantage in this industry declined
while that of foreign firms rose, remaining, however, well below the U.S.

firms' level. In transport equipment, U.S. multinationals retained some
advantage over others in both groups of countries, but there was some
catching up by foreign firms within developed countries. Outside of machinery
and transport equipment we find mostly declines in the comparative advantage
of U.S. affiliates in developing countries, and mixed results in developed
countries.

There is no evidence of any tendency for U.S. affiliates to gravitate toward the distribution of domestic firm exports over time as far as we
can judge, given the number of missing observations for 1966. The 1977 affiliate export pattern was more similar to that of 1966 than to the domestic
firm product distribution in either 1966 or 1977. The product composition of

— 16

affiliate

—

exports also was less like that of the domestic firms in 1977 than

in 1966.6

Exports from all Locations by U.S. Multinationals
Another way to view the comparative advantage of U.S. multinational
firms, escaping the effects of their choices of location, is to look at their

exports from all locations, including those from the parents in the U.S. and
those from their affiliates overseas. The distribution of these exports,
by industry, in 1966 and 1977 was as follows:

6The coefficients of correlation between sets of export shares were
r77M/66M = .58, r77M/66D = .43, r77/77], = .25, and rG5M/56D = .66, where M =
an industry's share in exports by majority—owned U.S. affiliates and D the
same share for non—U.S. and U.S. minority—owned firms, and 77 and 66 refer to
1966 and 1977. The full data set would have consisted of 5 product shares in
exports (the "other" category was excluded) for each of 29 countries of which
16 were developed and 13 developing. The number of available pairs of comparable shares was around 75 due mainly to the suppression of data by the original source owing to disclosure rules. The most serious omissions are some
1966 data for the metals, machinery, and transportation equipment industries
for the developing areas and U.S. affiliate exports from Japan in the all—area
totals. A very large part of U.S. affiliate activity in Japan was in
minority—owned affiliates, for which trade data were not collected in the
Commerce Department surveys.

— 17 -

Over this eleven—year period there was remarkably little change in
the industry distribution of exports: slight declines in foods and metals and

small increases in chemicals and transport equipment. These changes were
much smaller than those for parents alone (Table 2) or for affiliates alone
(Table 3). The implication is that the comparative advantages of U.S. multinationals remained virtually constant; the shifts we observed for parents in
the U.S. and for their affiliates abroad must have represented changes in the
comparative advantages of production locations.

We can also compare the comparative advantage of U.S. multinational
companies, as represented by their worldwide operations, with those of other

U.S. companies and those of foreign companies, described in the earlier
tables.

Relative to non—multinational U.S. firms and to foreign firms,
TJ.S.—based multinationals appear to have had a comparative advantage in

transport equipment and in machinery in 1977 ("best estimates" in Table 4).

Non—multinational U.S. firms had a relative advantage in chemicals, non—U.S.
firms in developed countries in metals, and non—U.S. firms in developing
countries in foods and in other manufacturing.

Between 1966 and 1977, the comparative advantage of U.S. multinationals remained very stable, as mentioned earlier, while that of other U.S.

firms shifted toward machinery and other manufacturing and away from chemicals
and transport equipment. 'oreign firms shifted toward the comparative advantage of U.S. multinationals, particularly foreign firms in developing
countries. In all the cases but one in which the share of their exports in an
industry was substantially above that of the U.S. multinationals in 1977, they
had decreased that share in the previous eleven years and in the cases in
which their share was below that of U.S. multinationals, they had increased

Shifts in the Geographical Origin of Exports by U.S. Multinationals

Since the comparative advantage of U.S. multinationals remained virtually constant between 1966 and 1977 while those of the parent firms in the
U.S. and of their overseas affiliates each changed, there must have been
shifts in the advantages of production in different geographical locations.

Such changes are reflected in the following data on changes in the sources of

exports by U.S. multinational firms:

There was a substantial shift away from the United States in the

sources of U.S. ME's exports. The shift was largest for metals and next for
chemicals, and least for transport equipment. From these data we might infer
that the sharpest decline in comparative advantage for the U.S. as a

- 20

-

geographical entity was in metals, not too surprising given the problems of
both the iron and steel and nonferrous metals industries. The lack of change
in transportation equipment is more surprising, but it probably reflects the
retention of U.S. comparative advantage in the aircraft industry and the very
large trade in motor vehicles and components with Canada. Also, some of the
changes that have attracted public attention may have accelerated after 1977.
The changes in the sources of exports are all measured in percentage

terms. They do not involve actual decreases in the value of exports from the
U.S., but rather slower increases in the U.S. than in foreign countries.

It cannot be inferred that the slower growth in exports from the U.S. was the
result of the more rapid increases abroad; in fact, multinational firms
increased exports from the U.S. more than did the non—multinationals.
Conclusions

The main conclusions of this paper reflect the importance of
distinguishing between the competitiveness and comparative advantages of U.S.
firms and those of the U.S. and other countries as geographical locations for
production. The competitiveness of U.S. firms, as measured by their share in
world exports of manufactured goods, decreased much less than did that of the
U.S. as a geographical entity. The share of U.S. multinationals in world
exports, including exports by all their foreign affiliates, actually
increased. The reasons for the difference are that U.S. multinationals

increased their exports from the U.S. faster than did firms with no overseas
operations and increased exports from their foreign affiliates still more.
Relative to non—multinational U.S. firms and to foreign firms, the
comparative advantage of U.S. multinationals was in transport equipment

and machinery. That of non—multinational U.S. firms was in chemicals, that of
foreign firms in developed countries was in metals, and that of foreign firms

— 21

in

—

developing countries was in foods and other manufacturing. While there were

some considerable shifts in the comparative advantages of foreign firms and of
U.S. firms without overseas manufacturing operations, the comparative advantage of U.S. multinational firms

hardly

changed at all between 1966 and 1977.

Thus, the changes in the comparative advantage of their U.S. operations,

mainly decreases in foods and metals and increases in transport equipment,
reflected the redistribution of the location of their production for export.
The largest shift away from the U.S. as a location for export production was
in the metals industry, followed by chemicals, and the smallest was in
transport equipment.

The comparative advantage of foreign firms, as represented by the
industry distribution of their world—wide exports, converged toward that of

U.S. multinationals. That was particularly the case for foreign firms in
developing countries, shifting away from exports of food and chemical products
and towards machinery.

The implication is that the decline in U.S. shares in world manufactures exports in the late 1960's and 1970's was not, as sometimes alleged, to
be found in deficiencies in American management or declines in American technological leadership. The share of exports produced under U.S. management —

that

is, by U.S. multinational firms operating at home and abroad —

actually

increased. The decline in the U.S. share, it may be inferred, reflects a relative diminution in the advantage of the U.S. as a production location.

Notes to Table A—i
aFor 1957, 1966, and 1977A, SITC 0, 1, —8, less 0141_0145. These totals
include substantial amounts of non—manufactured products but were the
best approximations that could be made for all three years. For 1977B,
we used a better approximation to exports of manufactured goods from
Lipsey and Kravis (1982), Table B-i. Both of the 1977 figures were
then corrected by adding exports from Taiwan, from Table A—7.
Line 1:

1977B: Lipsey and Kravis (1982), Table B—i.
1966 and 1977A: United Nations (1980), (April 1972), and (July 1972).
1957: Line 2 plus line 4•

Line 2: 1966 and 1977A and B: Same as line 1.
1957: Data for OEEC imbers, OEEC (1958), Tables 3 and L.
Data for U.S., SITC 0, 1, and 14_8 from OEEC (1959), Table 2,
p. 23, with correction of SITC 5 from United Nations (1958),
and SITC 0141_OL5 from OEEC (1958).
Data for Canada for SITC 0, 1, and I_8 from United Nations
(1958) and for SITC 0141—01t5 from OEEC (1958). Data for Japan
from United Nations (1958). Data for Australia, New Zealand,
and South Africa, SITC 0, 1, and 5—8, from United Nations (1965?)
and for SITC 4 for Australia and 014l_015 for Australia and South
Africa from United Nations (1958).

Line 3: 1966 and l977A and B: Same as line 1.
1957: See source for line 2.

Line : 1966 and 1977A and B: Same as line 1.
1957: Data for SITC 0, 1, and 5—8 from United Nations (1963), minus a
rough estimate of developing—country exports of SITC 014l0145,
from import data in United Nations (1958), pp. 78—81.
Line 5:

1977: Simple average of figures for 1971 ( 1.7 billion), from U.S.
Department of Commerce (1976), Table E—7, Columns 3 and 6, and
for 1980 ($ 8.3 billion), from U.S. Department of Commerce
(1983), Table G—12, Col. 13.
1957 and 1966: Assumed to be 0 on the assumption that the rate of
growth in the years before 197)4 was not far short of the rate
between 197)4 and 1980.

Line 12:

Estiited from sales of minority—owned affiliates by assuming
that the ratio of exports to sales was the same in minority—
owned affiliates as in n.jority—owned affiliates in the same
industry and geographical area. Some combinations of areas
and/or industries had to be ide because of disclosure problems.
Exports from countries for which elements of this calculation
were missing were assumed to bear the same relation to sales as
in the covered countries.

Line 13:

Estirted from sales of minority—owned affiliates in developing
countries as a group within each industry by assuming that the
ratio of exports to sales was identical to that of njority—
owned affiliates. This method applied to the developed
countries produced a 1977 figure about 50 per cent above the
one used for line 12, which was based on a detailed country
breakdown not available for developing countries. For 1966,
however, this method produced a figure 6 per cent below the one
from the detailed country breakdown.
