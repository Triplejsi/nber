The Changing Landscape of Blockbuster Punitive Damages Awards
Alison F. Del Rossi and W. Kip Viscusi
NBER Working Paper No. 15571
December 2009
JEL No. K10,K40
ABSTRACT
This article investigates the determinants of the blockbuster punitive damages awards of at least $100
million. As of the end of 2008, there had been 100 such awards with an average value of $3.0 billion.
The U.S. Supreme Court decision in State Farm v. Campbell suggested a single digit upper bound
on the punitive damages/compensatory damages ratio, which reduced the annual number of blockbuster
awards, the total annual value of blockbuster awards, and the punitive damages/compensatory damages
ratio. Applying the 1:1 ratio from Exxon Shipping Co. et al. v. Baker et al. broadly would eliminate
most of the blockbuster awards.

1. Introduction
By their very nature, punitive damages awards tend to be large. Punitive damages
awards usually arise in cases where juries perceive the conduct to be particularly
egregious, and the compensatory damages associated with such cases are often great as
well. If the purpose of the award is to punish defendants for severe harms or to provide
incentives to deter the conduct that led to these harms, then one would expect these
awards to be reasonably substantial in absolute terms but not necessarily large relative to
the value of compensatory damages. From the standpoint of economic efficiency, the
appropriate relation between punitive damages and compensatory damages will depend
on the probability of detecting and punishing the behavior to provide the appropriate
economic incentives as well as perhaps on factors other than deterrence, such as
punishment.1
Although punitive damages could serve a constructive role in some
circumstances, there have been signals that the process for setting punitive damages may
have gone awry. Whereas punitive awards for $1 million or more formerly garnered
news attention, awards at even higher levels than that have become quite common. The
extreme outliers involve much greater stakes than $1 million. Hersch and Viscusi (2004)
and Viscusi (2004) developed tabulations of what they called the “blockbuster punitive
damages awards,” which were those punitive awards of at least $100 million.
Notwithstanding this quite high cutoff, they identified 64 blockbuster awards as of 2004.
In this article, we update and analyze the blockbuster punitive damages award tally
through 2008, which now includes 100 blockbuster awards.

Polinsky and Shavell (1998) summarize the economic theory of punitive damages.

The emergence of blockbuster awards has been coupled with a series of studies
that have questioned the ability of jurors to set punitive damages levels such as these in a
meaningful way. Although jurors often are able to form reasonable judgments regarding
the reprehensibility of behavior, they have difficulty in mapping these concerns into a
level of punitive damages in a consistent manner.2 Jurors also are subject to a variety of
behavioral anomalies, such as hindsight bias, which may lead to a judgment after the fact
that the behavior is more blameworthy than it actually is.3 Anchoring effects also may be
influential to the extent that irrelevant anchors provided by plaintiffs’ attorneys serve as a
form of guidance to jurors in search of a damages number.4 Unfortunately, jury
instructions do not provide the type of meaningful guidance needed to overcome these
shortcomings.
Extremely large punitive awards may have substantial economic consequences.
A sufficiently large award may threaten the solvency of the firm. Short of such
catastrophic effects on the viability of the firm, very high damages awards deter
innovation and the introduction of novel products that may be subject to the risk of large
awards, as novel technologies appear to be harder hit than older, but possibly riskier,
technologies.5 Costs to consumers also are increased by high damages amounts, to the
extent that companies’ expectations of liability costs raise product prices.6 Because of

production of childhood vaccines.

their unpredictability, punitive awards may have little constructive effect in promoting
efficient behaviors, such as appropriate levels of product safety.7
Controversies over the appropriateness of punitive damages awards combined
with the size of the awards and the economic repercussions from very large awards have
prompted several U.S. Supreme Court reviews of cases involving punitive damages. The
decisions in the early 1990s generally supported the awards, but subsequent decisions
focused on whether there should be limits on the ratio of punitive damages to
compensatory damages.8 In the 1991 decision in Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company
v. Haslip, the Court concluded that a ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages
of four to one was not improper.9 The 1993 decision in TXO Prod. Corp. v. Alliance Res.
Corp. affirmed a punitive damages judgment in which the ratio of punitive damages to
compensatory damages was over 526.10 In 1996 in BMW of N. Am., Inc. v. Gore, the
Court remarked that the “most commonly cited indicium of an unreasonable or excessive
punitive damages award is its ratio to the actual harm inflicted on the plaintiff.”11
Subsequently, the 2003 U.S. Supreme Court Decision in State Farm v. Campbell issued
more precise guidance for the reasonableness of punitive damages awards based on this
ratio, which the court believed should not exceed a single-digit ratio: “Our jurisprudence
and the principles it has now established demonstrate, however, that in practice few
7

Viscusi (1998a,b) examines the weak incentive effects of punitive damages empirically.
In addition to its rulings on the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages, in 2007 the U.S. Supreme
Court decided that a jury can consider harm to non-parties when deciding how reprehensible the conduct of
the defendant, but it cannot consider such harm in determining the level of punitive damages. See Philip
Morris USA v. Williams, 127 S. Ct. 1057 (2007). This decision has resulted in the reversal and a new trial
to determine punitive damages in Bullock v. Philip Morris, Inc. (Cal Ct. App., No. B164398, 1/30/08), a
case analyzed in this paper.

awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a
significant degree, will satisfy due process.”12 In 2008 the U.S. Supreme Court supported
a punitive damages/compensatory damages maximum ratio of 1.0 in Exxon Shipping Co.
v. Baker, which it viewed as an appropriate upper bound ratio for maritime oil spill
cases.13 In her opinion that dissented in part, Justice Ginsburg hypothesized that the 1:1
ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages might have broader applicability in
future cases: “On next opportunity, will the Court rule, definitively, that 1:1 is the ceiling
due process requires in all of the States, and for all federal claims?”14
Our focus on the implications of the recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions is
twofold. First, we analyze the trends in the blockbuster awards throughout the era in
which blockbuster awards have occurred to identify the determinants of these awards as
well as whether there has been any decline in these very large awards in the wake of the
State Farm case. Second, we explore the implications of Justice Ginsburg’s conjecture
by also undertaking an analysis of how a lower ratio of 1:1 based on the Exxon Shipping
Co. v. Baker decision would affect blockbuster awards if this ratio were applied more
generally.
Whereas the main focus of the previous studies of blockbuster awards was
primarily on the overall distribution of awards, this article examines their economic
underpinnings. How responsive is the magnitude of the blockbuster awards to the level
of compensatory damages? Are particular industries subject to larger punitive awards
even after taking into account the level of compensatory damages? Have the number of

blockbuster awards been on the rise or have they become less frequent? Has the total
amount of the blockbuster awards exhibited a rising or falling trend over time? If there
has been a trend, is it related to the State Farm decision, which one would have expected
to lead to a dampening of blockbuster awards? The overall result is that such awards have
been on the rise, but after the State Farm decision there has been a statistically significant
drop in the number of blockbuster punitive damages awards, their amount, and the ratio
of punitive damages to compensatory damages.

2. An Inventory of Blockbuster Punitive Damages Awards
The set of blockbuster cases with punitive damages awards of $100 million or
more (in nominal dollars) was found through a wide-ranging search of a number of
sources including, but not limited to, the following: LEXIS combined jury verdicts and
settlements, Lexis-Nexis and Westlaw databases, Lawyers Weekly USA, and
VerdictSearch’s annual “Top 100 Jury Verdicts” for 2006, 2007, and 2008. Basic case
information, such as the year of the award, amounts of punitive and compensatory
awards, and type of industry involved was drawn mainly from news articles and
published court opinions. We identified 100 blockbuster punitive damages awards for
the time period January, 1985 through December, 2008. We have not identified any
blockbuster awards before 1985. Table 1 lists the blockbuster awards by year. Appendix
Table A1 sorts these awards by the size of the award.

Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of the blockbuster punitive damages awards
for the sample, where all awards have been converted to 2008 dollars.15 Due to the
enormous range of the award amounts, the figure plots the frequency of the natural log of
punitive damages awards on the horizontal axis. For reference, the scale at the top of the
graph indicates the corresponding levels of punitive damages. Even using a logarithmic
scale, the distribution of punitive damages is greatly skewed right, or positively skewed.
Almost 20 percent of the awards have real values less than or equal to $150 million, and
the vast majority (73 percent) of the awards fall under the $500 million mark. Nearly 85
percent of the awards are less than or equal to $1 billion, but there are 6 cases (6 percent
of the sample) that exceed $5 billion in 2008 dollars.
Table 2 summarizes the distribution of the punitive damages awards by type of
defendant. In almost all instances, the defendant in punitive damages cases is a corporate
entity rather than an individual or a government agency. One-fourth of the awards in the
sample are against firms in the energy or chemical industry. The 1995 punitive damages
award against Exxon Corporation, which has since become the Exxon Mobil
Corporation, of $5.0 billion for damages related to the Exxon Valdez oil spill is perhaps
the best known of these awards. However, this is by no means the only such award in the
multi-billion dollar range for firms in the energy and chemical industry. There was also
an $11.8 billion punitive damages award in 2003 for Exxon’s alleged accounting
violations in Exxon Mobil Corporation v. Alabama Department of Conservation and
Natural Resources, a $3.4 billion punitive damages award in 1997 in In re New Orleans

Tank Car Leakage Fire Litigation, and a $3 billion award in 1985 in Pennzoil v. Texaco.
These cases involve a mix of financial harms or serious environmental harms.
Firms in the finance, investment, and insurance industry account for close to onefourth of all blockbuster punitive damages awards. The 1996 State Farm case is perhaps
the best known of these 23 blockbuster award cases. The largest punitive award in this
group is a $2.1 billion bench award against members of the Uzan family of Turkey in
2003 for fraud in loan transactions with Motorola Credit Corporation; this award was
later reduced to $1 billion, an amount upheld by a federal appeals court.16 The mean
punitive damages amount for these cases is $546.3 million, approximately one-third of
the level for the energy and chemical industry punitive damages mean. Also, the mean
ratio of punitive to compensatory damages is about two-thirds of the ratio for the energy
and chemical industry, but the average ratio is still in the double digits, above the State
Farm single digit guidelines.
The third largest industry group of firms in terms of the number of blockbuster
punitive damages awards consists of those firms in the pharmaceutical or health care
industry, which account for 16 blockbuster cases.17 The magnitude of these awards is
about the same as for the finance, investment, and insurance industry category. The
prominence of the pharmaceutical and health care industry is not surprising, as litigation
involving medical malpractice, medical devices, and prescription drugs has long been
noted as being a major contributor to perceptions of the existence of a tort liability
crisis.18 Whether there is or has been a so-called “crisis” is beyond the scope of this

article, except to the extent that the analysis here indicates that there is evidence of an
imbalance between the punitive damages and compensatory damages amounts for the
blockbuster cases affecting this industry. Within the set of firms with punitive damages
at the blockbuster level, pharmaceutical and health care firms are well represented but are
by no means outliers in terms of the magnitude of the awards.
By far the greatest outlier category is the cigarette industry. The five blockbuster
awards average $44.5 billion, and even after excluding the $145 billion award in the
Engle Florida class action in 2000, the mean punitive damages value is $10.2 billion.
The smallest of the cigarette blockbuster punitive damages awards is $150 million in the
2002 case, Schwarz v. Philip Morris, Inc., in the state of Oregon. This award is
nevertheless strikingly large given that it is an individual smoker case. The imbalance
between the punitive damages and compensatory damages in this case is reflected in the
case’s ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages, which is 882.4. The second
smallest blockbuster cigarette award is the $3 billion award in the 2001 individual
smoker case, Boeken v. Philip Morris, Inc. The ratio of punitive damages to
compensatory damages in this California case was 541.5, or two orders of magnitude
beyond the single digit guidance in the State Farm case. The largest punitive damages
award in an individual smoker case was the $28 billion award in 2002 in Bullock v. Philip
Morris, Inc. This case, which involved the same plaintiff’s attorney, Michael Piuze, as in
the Boeken individual smoker cigarette case, had a ratio of punitive damages to
compensatory damages of approximately 43,000, which is the highest ratio for any
blockbuster punitive damages award.19 A very large cigarette punitive damages award

We have excluded Garamendi v. Altus Finance, S.A. from this comparison; since compensatory damages
were zero in this case, the ratio is infinite.

was in the 2003 Illinois “lights” cigarette class action, Price v. Philip Morris, Inc., in
which the judge in this Madison County, Illinois bench trial awarded $3.1 billion in
punitive damages, with a ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages of 0.4.20
The final blockbuster cigarette award was the $145 billion award in Engle v. Philip
Morris, Inc. That case’s punitive damages/compensatory damages ratio of 11,417.3
overstates the actual ratio that would be observed if it were possible to calculate the full
value of compensatory damages for the entire class and not just the compensatory
damages for the class representatives, which was the focus of the jury award. Of all the
blockbuster cigarette awards, only the punitive damages/compensatory damages ratio in
the Price case would be under the single-digit State Farm threshold, and all other
punitive awards for the cigarette industry are at the triple-digit level or beyond. The
cigarette industry has experienced particularly extreme blockbuster awards in terms of
their levels, but the industry has not had as many awards of this type as have some
broader industry groups in Table 2.
Our data set includes seven unusual cases involving punitive damages against the
perpetrators of violent crimes. The largest punitive award in this category was in Swan v.
20

This very high award in a bench trial is one of two bench trials and one of twelve punitive awards in the
sample in excess of $1 billion (in nominal dollars). The role of a Madison County judgment in terms of its
outlier status is not too surprising given Madison County’s reputation as “The Lawsuit Capital of the
World” and “Class Action Paradise,” as noted by Amalia Deligiannis, “Madison County: A Corporation’s
Worst Nightmare,” 14 Corp. Legal Times 52 (2004). Other designations of Madison County as the number
one “Judicial Hellhole” and a “jackpot jurisdiction” have been provided by the American Tort Reform
Association, Bringing Justice to Judicial Hellholes 2003, at 3 (2003). The Illinois Supreme Court
overturned Judge Byron’s verdict and in August, 2007 turned down a request by plaintiffs to reopen the
case. Illinois also has been a prominent state for class actions. In 1995-1996, based on reported judicial
decisions, Illinois ranked first in terms of the number of consumer cases, third in torts, and second in
securities. The 1996-1997 Illinois class action rankings were first in consumer cases, second in torts, and
fifth in securities. Illinois ranked in the top five states in terms of the frequency of class actions per
population for all these groupings. See Hensler et al. (2000). With respect to medical malpractice cases,
Vidmar (2005) found that an analysis of Madison County and St. Clair County produced “no evidence to
support the perception that medical malpractice jury awards in these counties are frequent or that jury
verdicts for plaintiffs are outrageous.” Medical malpractice cases do not figure prominently in punitive
damages awards, in general, but six of the blockbuster cases in Table 1 are medical malpractice cases.

Einhorn in 1999. The parents of the victim were awarded $155 million in compensatory
damages and $752 million in punitive damages in a civil trial. The second largest verdict
was handed down in 2004 in Brown v. Dorsey. That case involved a conspiracy by
sheriff’s department employees culminating in the murder of the sheriff-elect. The civil
trial in 2004 led to a judgment of $326.1 million in compensatory damages and $450
million in punitive damages against the former sheriff and two co-conspirators. Two
2008 blockbuster awards, Estate of Mack v. Mack and Estate of LoCascio v. LoCascio,
involved children of murder victims seeking damages from family members who were
convicted of murdering their mothers. The punitive damages awarded in Mack equaled
$405 million (with compensatory damages of $185 million), and in LoCascio the punitive
damages award was $100 million (with compensatory damages of $25.1 million).
Another $100 million punitive damages award was given to a murder victim’s family in
the 2006 “American Beauty” case, de Villers v. Rossum.21 The remaining two violent
crime cases were a 2007 sexual battery civil case, Martin v. Swain and a 2008 wrongfuldeath claim against the Cuban government and its leaders, the Estate of del Pino v. The
Republic of Cuba. In the Martin case the verdict was $155 million in compensatory
damages and $100 million in punitive damages against a father for many years of sexual
abuse of his daughter. In the del Pino case, the award of $252.5 million, $250 in punitive
damages alone, was given to the children of a man who was allegedly tortured and killed
by hanging by the Cuban government. The ratios of punitive damages to compensatory
damages in these cases are generally small relative to the other blockbuster cases, ranging
from 1.4 in Brown v. Dorsey to 16.7 in de Villers v. Rossum. An exception is the case
21

Rossum, the murderer, attempted to make de Villers’ death appear to be a suicide by placing a wedding
photo, her opened diary indicating their marriage was failing, and rose petals near her husband’s body. See
Natalie White, “$106 Million in ‘American Beauty’ Murder,” Lawyers Weekly USA, April 24, 2006.

against the Cuban government, which has a ratio of 100. Excluding the latter award,
which is unusual in that the defendant is a foreign government, the mean ratio for the
other six violent crime punitive damages awards is 6.5 and the median ratio is 4.4.
These violent crime cases are clearly different from other blockbuster punitive
damages awards and the group shares a number of characteristics. All but Martin v.
Swain concerned a highly visible, publicity-generating murder, and in all, liability is
already established in the civil trial, as each defendant had already been convicted and
was serving lengthy terms. Also, these cases are the only ones in the data set in which
both litigants are individuals rather than corporate or government parties.22 In the murder
cases, family members of the victims claim a key purpose of the civil suit, and for
seeking punitive damages in particular, is to make sure that the murderer can never profit
from the murder. In fact, the plaintiff’s attorney in the Einhorn case claimed that Einhorn
had been approached to write a book about the case, enabling him to profit from the
murder.23 The plaintiffs in de Villers v. Rossum brought in testimony from a professor of
marketing about Rossum’s potential earnings through selling her story to various national
media or selling movie or book rights. The Brown family’s attorney said in an interview,
“‘Let’s be honest: nobody has this type of money…But as I discussed with the jury, and I
think they understood, this prevents any of the defendants from ever profiting from any
sort of media deal…’” 24 Other reasons for the verdicts, noted by attorneys and family
members, are to reflect the egregious nature of the crime and to ‘send a message,’ with
the avowed intent of deterring future crimes. One juror in the case against the Cuban
22

The exception in this group is the del Pino award which involved a national government as a defendant
and which did not have a criminal trial proceeding.

government noted that they wanted to send a “political statement.”25 None of these
plaintiffs has received any compensation to date.
Several states have reputations for having courts in which plaintiffs seeking large
awards have more favorable prospects. Consistent with this view, Table 3 shows that the
distribution of the awards does differ substantially across states, as blockbuster awards
tend to be concentrated geographically. Exactly half the states (25 states) have had any
blockbuster punitive damages awards. California and Texas are the leading states in
terms of the total number of blockbuster cases, with 21 in California and 20 in Texas.
California has the highest total value blockbuster punitive damages award, $49.7 billion,
over four times greater than the total value of the punitive damages for Texas and nearly
3 times greater than the state with the second highest total value, Alabama.
It is interesting to compare the California and Texas experiences with that of New
York. These three states have the largest populations, and California and New York both
have been the site of prominent cigarette cases. However, New York has had only two
blockbuster punitive damages awards. The average per capita value of the total
blockbuster punitive damages awards in the state from 1985–2008 is $136 in New York,
as compared to $1,429 in California, more than 10 times higher. This and other per
capita damages amounts in Table 3 pertain to the average across the 24 years in the
sample of the total blockbuster award amounts in 2008 dollars, divided by the state’s
population in the year of the awards. The per capita value of the total damages in Texas
is $629, as most of these awards tend to be at or just above the $100 million lower bound
to be in the sample, which is still 4.6 times greater than for New York State. The

empirical analysis below will examine whether Texas and California are outliers
controlling for other case characteristics, such as the industry involved.
Table 4 describes other key characteristics of the 100 blockbuster cases, including
the Engle case. Some of the breakdowns are of interest even though they did not prove to
be statistically significant in the regression analysis reported below. In terms of the types
of damages sought, 10 percent were for environmental harm, 40 percent were personal
injury and fatality cases, and 50 percent were cases involving monetary damages for
pecuniary harms. Six percent of the cases involved individual litigants in which private
individuals were both plaintiffs and defendants; these correspond to the violent crime
cases discussed above, excluding the del Pino award. The most common pattern
involved individuals paired against corporate or business entities, as 53 percent of the
cases involved an individual plaintiff and a business or corporate defendant.26 The
remainder of the cases involved plaintiffs and defendants who were both business or
government entities.

3. Temporal Trends of Blockbuster Punitive Damages
Blockbuster punitive damages are a comparatively new phenomenon. The first
punitive damages award that we have identified as breaking the $100 million barrier was
in 1985.27 The two blockbuster awards in 1985 were in the California case, Micro/Vest v.
ComputerLand, and a $3 billion award in the highly publicized case of Pennzoil v.
Texaco. As the awards roster in Table 1 indicates, no awards earned blockbuster status in
26

This group also includes the del Pino award which involved individuals against a national government
and its leaders. In the interest of simplicity, the label on this variable in the regressions below is “Individual
and Business Litigants.”
27
While there may have been an earlier blockbuster award, this is the first award identified in the searches
for this paper or in Hersch and Viscusi (2004) or Viscusi (2004).

13

1986, 1987, 1990, or 1992, so in the early blockbuster awards era the number of punitive
awards meeting that criterion were not great. However, after 1992 every year through
2008 has had at least one award at the blockbuster level.
While the 2003 U.S. Supreme Court State Farm decision is relatively recent, 31
percent of the sample of blockbuster cases came in 2004 or thereafter, providing a basis
for assessing whether there has been a shift in the punitive damages landscape after this
decision, holding fixed other case characteristics. The exploration below will not only
compare the performance of the blockbuster cases before and after the State Farm
decision, but will also assess whether the emergence of blockbuster cases has been
affected by the State Farm decision, as one might expect.
Figure 2 illustrates the temporal trend in the number of blockbuster awards by
year. The number of blockbuster awards in any given year tends to be small, reaching a
peak of 12 in 1999, with 8 occurring in 2003, but never more than 7 in any other year.
Because of the small numbers, one should be cautious in generalizing with respect to the
overall trend in the absence of a formal statistical analysis that distinguishes which
effects are statistically significant and which are not. For example, there are few awards
in 1997 and 1998 before the spike in awards in 1999, and there are few awards in two of
the years after 1999. The 1999 spike in awards did not start a new upward trend, but the
tripling in the number of blockbuster awards in 1999 from the levels in the previous two
years may not be entirely random either.
What may have accounted for a jump in punitive damages awards in 1999? One
hypothesis is that the Master Settlement Agreement in the cigarette litigation at the end of
1998 may have led juries to think in terms of billions rather than millions in setting

14

damages awards. The lawsuits filed by the states seeking to recoup damages relating to
the states’ share of the Medicaid costs of smoking were settled for over $200 billion,
including $206 billion to 46 states, $36.8 billion to four states that settled individually, as
well as other costs.28 If jurors use the value of this highly publicized settlement as an
anchor in setting punitive damages awards,29 then one would expect both the frequency
and the level of blockbuster awards to rise after this settlement.
There are two special cases that will be distinguished in the subsequent statistical
analysis because their ratios of punitive damages to compensatory damages are
misleading or undefined. First, Engle v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. is a Florida tobacco
class action case in which the compensatory damages amount of $12.7 million pertains to
the class representatives, while the punitive damages amount of $145 billion is for the
entire class. Thus, while the punitive damages value is pertinent, the ratio of punitive
damages to compensatory damages will be misleading and overstated. The Engle case
also involved the largest punitive damages value in the sample, and including it in some
of the analyses may distort the average performance of the sample in terms of measures
such as the mean damages value. Second, there are some statistical problems raised in
the subsequent analyses by Garamendi v. Altus Finance, S.A., which had zero
compensatory damages and $700 million in punitive damages. As a result, the ratio of
punitive damages to compensatory damages for this case is infinite. At different
junctures below, we will present results with and without these cases in the sample, as is
appropriate.

Table 5 summarizes the general characteristics of the blockbuster awards and
their pattern before and after the pivotal State Farm case. Panel A provides the
characteristics of the full sample, while Panels B and C, respectively, summarize the
comparable statistics before and after the 2003 State Farm decision. As noted earlier, to
ensure comparability, we converted all award values reported in tables and used in the
regressions to 2008 dollars using the Consumer Price Index. The mean punitive damages
amount across all cases excluding the Engle case is $1.2 billion, and is $3.0 billion
including that case. The median blockbuster award value is considerably less, reflecting
the highly skewed nature of the distribution of blockbuster awards. The punitive
damages amounts ranged from $100 million to $33.5 billion excluding the Engle case,
with a high of $181.3 billion including Engle, which is the largest punitive damages
award in the sample. Compensatory damages averaged $368.8 million excluding the
Engle case. If we exclude both Engle v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and Garamendi v.
Altus Finance, S.A. in analyzing the ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages,
the median ratio is 7.2, which is within the single digit ratio limit articulated in the State
Farm decision. However, the mean ratio is 502.4, while the maximum ratio is over
43,000, so there clearly is very wide variation in the relationship between punitive
damages and compensatory damages.
Comparison of the statistics in Panels B and C of Table 5 indicates a possible
effect of the State Farm decision on blockbuster awards. The mean punitive
damages/compensatory damages award ratio exhibits significant declines in Panel C as

16

compared to Panel B.30 The median value of this ratio also drops significantly for cases
decided after the State Farm decision, and the median ratio is below the single-digit limit
for cases decided since 2003 but above that limit for earlier awards.31 These overall
effects are suggestive of a State Farm effect but do not take into account other influences
on the trend of punitive damages awards over this time period, which may also have led
to lowering of award amounts and ratios in the absence of the case.
The general patterns shown in Table 5 are also borne out if the Bullock case is
excluded. Unlike the Engle case and Garamendi v. Altus, the Bullock case has a
meaningful positively valued compensatory damages award so that a valid ratio can be
computed. However, the Bullock case has an extremely high ratio of punitive damages to
compensatory damages that influences the average values for the sample. As the
statistics in Appendix Table A2 indicate, excluding the Bullock case has negligible effect
on the median statistics, but lowers the mean punitive damages value to $826.8 million
overall and to $1.0 billion before the State Farm decision. The mean ratio of punitive
damages to compensatory damages is 63.4 overall and 85.4 in the period before the State
Farm decision without the Bullock award, compared to 502.4 and 717.7, respectively,
with the award. Both the mean ratio and the median ratio exhibit significant declines
after the State Farm decision even if the Bullock case is excluded.32
To explore the determinants of the number of blockbuster cases over time, Table
6 presents the negative binomial regression results for the number of blockbuster punitive
30

The test statistic using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test for equality of means for the ratio is z=3.51,
which has a p-value of 0.0004. The decline in the mean punitive damages amount is not statistically
significant at the usual levels.
31
The Pearson chi-squared test of the equality of the medians yields a chi-squared test statistic equal to
6.92 (p-value=0.009) and equal to 5.81 (p-value=0.016) with a continuity correction.
32
The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test statistic is z=3.44 (p-value=0.001). The Pearson chi-squared test
statistic equals 6.60 (p-value=0.010) and equals 5.52 (p-value=0.019) with a continuity correction.

damages awards by year, from 1985–2008. The dependent variable, the number of
awards in each year, is a discrete variable that involves a small number of counts, which
sometimes take on a zero value. Consequently, we use a negative binomial regression
model, rather than using ordinary least squares, to estimate the effects of time-related
variables on the number of blockbuster awards in any year. 33 The coefficients, reported
in Table 6, provide the estimated effect on the log of the expected number of cases in any
year due to a one unit change in the variable. Consequently, the exponential of the
coefficient (minus 1) provides the percentage change in the number of cases for a one
unit change in the variable.34
To control for the time trend in the volume of cases, the regressions in Table 6
also include the number of civil court cases filed by year.35 An alternative measure of the
possible set of cases that might generate blockbuster awards would be the number of
punitive damages awards generally, but these are not feasible to construct on an annual
basis for the sample period. 36

33

One cannot reject the hypothesis that the parameter α that serves as a measure of overdispersion in the
negative binomial model equals zero. In all regressions, likelihood ratio tests (null hypothesis that alpha
equals zero) yield chi-squared statistics virtually equal to zero. The Poisson model is a special case of the
negative binomial model when alpha equals zero, and the negative binomial results in Table 6 are not
distinguishable from Poisson estimates of the same equations.
34
As an example, in the first equation of Table 6, the coefficient on the time trend variable is 0.140 and
exp(0.140)=1.150. Thus, each additional year increases the expected number of cases by 15 percent.
35
These data are from the Court Statistics Project, State Court Caseload Statistics, 1985-2006. (National
Center for State Courts 1985-2006.) Because data for 2007 and 2008 were unavailable, the number of civil
filings was set equal to zero for those two years and an indicator for missing state filings is included in the
regressions. Regressions excluding 2007 and 2008 yielded virtually identical results.
36
Using data from the Civil Justice Survey of State Courts (CJSSC), it is possible to calculate the number
of punitive damages awards by year for three years, but these data are samples of cases from large counties
and not a census of cases from these counties. The counties represented vary a bit over time, and in any
given year the sampling procedure imposes caps on the number of case types to be included so that the
comprehensive tallies in the National Center for State Courts data are a more meaningful index of civil case
trends. Only one “blockbuster” case is included in the CJSSC data. Keeping these limitations in mind the
total number of cases with nonzero values for punitive damages and compensatory damages was 184 in
1992, 180 in 1996, and 153 in 2001. The probability of a punitive damages award given a compensatory
damages award is 0.056 in 1992, 0.040 in 1996, and 0.043 in 2001. Authors’ calculations.

18

The number of state civil suit filings is never statistically significant. However,
the time trend counter variable has a significant positive effect, indicating that the number
of blockbuster awards increased over the 1985–2008 period. Each year that elapses
increases the number of punitive damages awards by about 14 to 15 percent. However,
there is a muting of such effects in the post-State Farm period from 2004–2008. We use
two different formulations to examine the effect of the State Farm decision on the annual
number of blockbuster awards. The result using an indicator variable for years after the
State Farm decision implies that the number of blockbuster cases is 52 percent less in
post-State Farm years, controlling for a general upward time trend (based on equation 1
regression coefficient). An alternative specification in equation 2, interacting the time
trend with the After State Farm indicator, shows a statistically significant reduction in the
upward temporal trend to an 11 percent increase per year post-State Farm. The inclusion
in equations 3 and 4 of an indicator variable for 1999, the year following the Master
Settlement Agreement, reflects the spike in the number of cases (2.5 times the number of
cases in other years), but it has little effect on general time trends. Similarly, in results
not reported here we found that an indicator variable for 1999-2008 (all years since the
Master Settlement Agreement) is not statistically significant and does not eliminate the
State Farm effect.
Whether blockbuster awards are exhibiting any discernible trend depends not only
on the number of awards in any year but also on their magnitude. However, because of
the enormous size of the outlier blockbuster award in the Engle case, the trend in the total
value of punitive damages over time may be dominated by this extreme outlier. To better
reflect the trend in the award amounts by year, Figure 3A presents the total blockbuster

19

award amounts by year for all cases, and Figure 3B excludes the Engle case. In each
instance blockbuster awards are on the rise, and as before, 1999 appears to be a year in
which the awards increased compared to previous years. The results in Figure 3B are
more informative in that they make clear that the total value of blockbuster awards has
been on the decline since 2002. That year exhibited a spike due to the $28 billion award
in the Bullock individual smoker case. It is conceivable that the jurors confused millions
for billions when setting the award level, and the trial judge reduced the punitive
damages amount to $28 million.37 Irrespective of the seemingly random factors that lead
to such jury awards, there appears to be a consistent downward trend in the total scale of
blockbuster damages in recent years. To the extent that one defines crises in the courts in
terms of trends in damages rather than simply absolute levels, then the fact that
blockbuster damages are not on the rise but are perhaps becoming less prominent is an
encouraging signal.
To attempt to place a magnitude on the trends of Figures 3A and 3B, we fit
regressions of the total value of punitive damage awards per year. Because of the skewed
nature of the distribution of damages, the dependent variable is the natural log of
blockbuster punitive damages in any given year. In some years, the total blockbuster
awards amount is zero. We address this by adding 1 to the value of both compensatory
damages and punitive damages in each year so that the regression results reported in
Table 7 will be with respect to variables that have finite values. We report Tobit
estimates of the equation rather than ordinary least squares, and the coefficient estimate
and marginal effects are both reported, although there is very little difference between the
two. The log total blockbuster award regression results in Table 7 include two

specifications each using the entire sample and the sample excluding the Engle award.
The marginal effect of ln(compensatory damages) is not significantly different from 1.0
in each instance. That is, one cannot reject the hypothesis that there is a unitary elasticity
of blockbuster awards with respect to the value of compensatory awards, controlling for
the other variables in the equation. However, because this equation deals only with
annual totals, the role of specific case characteristics is not taken into account.
The first of the other included variables is the time trend variable, which has a
positive effect that is statistically significant at the 5 percent level. Thus, while
compensatory damages have a proportional influence on punitive damages, there is an
additional upward drift in the total award amounts of 16 percent per year without the
Engle award and about 23 percent per year including the Engle award even after
controlling for inflation.
We explored two different formulations for how the State Farm case might have
affected total blockbuster punitive damages. The first specification interacts the indicator
variable for the post-State Farm era with the time trend variable, and the second
specification interacts the State Farm indicator variable with ln(total compensatory
damages), as the decision’s focus on punitive damages/compensatory damages ratios
should have affected the relationship between punitive damages and compensatory
damages. Each of these formulations leads to a statistically significant negative effect for
both the full sample of cases as well as the sample excluding the Engle case.38 The time
trend interaction with State Farm has a negative effect that eliminates about three-fourths
of the upward temporal trend in the real value of total damages: total blockbuster awards

38

Inclusion of both of the State Farm interaction variables in the same equation did not lead to statistically
significant effects.

21

increase at a rate of 5 percent per year post-State Farm (3 percent excluding the Engle
award). Alternatively, if one formulates the effect of State Farm in terms of how total
compensatory damages are linked to total punitive damages, the effect is to dramatically
reduce the elasticity from about 1.0 to the range of 0.5-0.6. The latter elasticities are
different from unitary elasticity at a significance level of 5 percent or better. From either
perspective, the State Farm decision dampened the total value of blockbuster punitive
damages as well as reducing the number of blockbuster punitive damages awards in any
year.
In contrast to the number of blockbuster awards per year, there is little evidence
that the annual magnitude of the awards has been affected by the Master Settlement
Agreement. In results that are not reported, neither an indicator variable for 1999 nor an
indicator for the post- Master Settlement Agreement years is statistically significant when
controlling for a general time trend and the level of total compensatory damages.

4. Determinants of Awards in Individual Cases
In addition to analyzing the determinants in the annual trends in the number and
level of blockbuster awards, it is instructive to analyze the individual awards themselves.
Doing so expands the range of questions that can be examined, such as whether particular
industries have been especially hard hit by blockbuster awards.
The particular hypotheses being explored are conditional in nature. Given that
there was a blockbuster punitive damages award in a particular case, did the
characteristics of the case influence the magnitude of the award? This is a quite different
issue than determining whether a particular case type is likely to lead to a blockbuster

22

punitive damages award. Answering that question would require a quite different sample
of cases, including those without blockbuster punitive damages awards, to determine
whether some cases are more likely to generate a blockbuster punitive damages award
and, if so, how large an award this will be.39
The first dependent variable in the regression analysis in this section is the value
of ln(punitive damages) for each particular case. In contrast, the regressions above
focused on the natural log of total damages for all cases in each year. Because the
relationship between punitive damages and compensatory damages is a central concern,
we exclude from the sample the Garamendi v. Altus Finance, S.A. case in which there
were no compensatory damages; thus, the sample consists of 99 observations. We
include the Engle case in the regression but add a separate interaction of Engle with the
compensatory damages variable in recognition of the narrower scope of the
compensatory damages amount as compared to the class-wide punitive damages amount.
Below we present sensitivity tests, excluding the Engle case. 40
Table 8 reports four sets of OLS regression results. Each equation includes the
ln(compensatory damages) and the interaction of this variable with the Engle case for that
observation. Equations 2 and 4 include the non-overlapping indicator variables for the
violent crime cases and the following five major industry groups: automobiles; cigarettes;
energy and chemicals; finance, investment, and insurance; and pharmaceuticals and

39

Two previous studies, Hersch and Viscusi (2004) and Viscusi (2004), explored these relationships using
earlier samples of blockbuster cases. These authors found no significant relation between punitive damages
and compensatory damages for the sample. However, there is a significant relationship between the log of
punitive damages and the log of compensatory damages, as well as a tobacco case dummy variable. See
Eisenberg and Wells (2006). All three of these articles relate more generally to the issue of predictability
of punitive damages. For another perspective on the predictability of punitive damages and what is meant
by predictability, see Polinsky (1997).
40
In addition, we examine regressions that exclude all cigarette cases, exclude bench awards, and include
the Garamendi v. Altus Finance, S.A. award.

23

health care. The omitted category is “other industries.” An indicator for cases involving
an individual plaintiff against a business or corporate defendant is included. There are
also indicator variables for the two most prominent states in the tally of blockbuster
punitive damages—California and Texas. In addition, the five cases involving a bench
trial are distinguished. Equations 3 and 4 include a post-State Farm interaction with the
value of ln(compensatory damages) to test whether on an individual case basis the State
Farm decision reduced the extent to which compensatory damages are transmitted into
punitive damages awards. For these results and all other OLS regressions, robust
standard errors are reported in parentheses and bootstrapped standard errors are in
brackets.41 The significance levels for the coefficients are quite similar for each, so for
concreteness our discussion will focus on the robust standard errors.
Controlling for industry and other case characteristics, the overall elasticity of
punitive damages with respect to compensatory damages is between 0.21 and 0.26. This
level is far less responsive than the unitary elasticity implied by the aggregate annual data
regression results. The State Farm interaction with ln(compensatory damages) is
negative and statistically significant, and exhibits a small change in magnitude when case
characteristics are included. In equation 3, without detailed control variables, the null
hypothesis that the sum of the State Farm interaction term and the ln(compensatory
damages) coefficients, 0.04, equals zero cannot be rejected. Equation 4 results suggest
that the elasticity has declined from 0.26 prior to the Supreme Court decision to 0.13 after
the ruling (and the latter estimated elasticity is significantly different from zero at the 5
percent level).

41

The bootstrapped standard errors for each regression in Tables 8 through 11 are based on 1,000
replications.

24

We performed several other regressions reported in Table 9 to test the robustness
of the effects of this U.S. Supreme Court decision. Two alternative specifications
provide similar evidence of a negative effect of the State Farm decision on blockbuster
awards. Including a time trend and interaction of the trend with a post-State Farm
indicator variable yields no significant time trend prior to the ruling, and a 4-5 percent
decrease in the size of the punitive awards for each year after the State Farm decision.
An indicator variable for the post-State Farm years is negative and statistically significant
and shows a 49 percent decline in punitive award levels after State Farm compared to
cases heard before the 2003 decision. Finally, in results not reported, because the State
Farm decision was a state court case, we added an indicator for cases heard in state
courts and an interaction of state cases with the post-State Farm indicator variable.
Although the coefficient of the indicator for state cases is consistently negative, it and the
interaction variable are never statistically significant.
Industry characteristics, rather than the level of compensatory damages alone,
appear to account for much of the variation in punitive damages in the results in Tables 8
and 9.42 Moreover, the pattern of industry or product type effects is consistent with the
general perceptions of which industries have been hardest hit by very large punitive
damages awards. By far the greatest effect is for the cigarette industry, for which the
punitive award is over 14 times the value of the omitted other industries category.43 Next

42

Although the results are similar in Table 9, for concreteness we focus on the implications of the results in
Table 8 (equation 4, specifically) when calculating the magnitude of these effects.
43
Because the dependent variable is a natural log and the industry variables are indicator variables, the
factor by which punitive damages awards are increased (compared to the excluded category) is equal to the
exponential of the coefficient. For cigarettes cases above, exp( 2.669) = 14.426, so punitive awards are
over 14 times greater than those of other industries, holding all else fixed. Alternatively, the percent
difference attributed to an indicator variable is found by subtracting one from the exponential of the
coefficient of the indicator variable and multiplying by 100. For example, the percent difference in

25

in prominence are the energy and chemical industry grouping and the finance,
investment, and insurance industry, which experience blockbuster awards over 130
percent greater than the other industries category. The pharmaceutical and health care
cases also have a positive blockbuster premium of over 100 percent. The violent crime
cases have a similar premium.
The one included case type category that does not have a statistically significant
premium relative to the other industries category is the automobile industry. This lack of
a differential effect is not surprising as the automobile cases tend to be more routine.
These cases involve lower transactions costs than other cases and have generally not been
associated with the various tort liability crises.44 While products liability generally has
received substantial attention among tort reformers, within the class of products,
automobiles have a less prominent role than, for example, pharmaceutical products and
medical devices.
Cases involving an apparent mismatch of an individual against a corporate entity
generate larger blockbuster damages than those involving more equally matched parties
of the same general class. The indicator variable for cases involving an individual
against a business entity has a positive effect, ranging from 61 to 66 percent in the fourth
columns of Tables 8 and 9, respectively.
The other included variables in Tables 8 and 9 are not statistically significant, but
their lack of significance is of some interest as well. Although California and Texas are
distinguished by the greatest number of blockbuster awards, controlling for compensatory

punitive damages for cases involving the finance, investment and insurance industry compared to the
excluded category of other industries, is [exp(0.834) − 1] x 100 = 130 percent.
44
Kakalik and Pace (1986) and Hensler et al. (1987) review the role of different lines of litigation, such as
automobile cases.

26

damages, industry type, and other factors, there is no statistically significant difference in
the performance of these states.45 Similarly, the coefficient for bench trials is not
statistically significant, but there are only five bench trials in the sample, which may limit
our ability to estimate this effect precisely. Finally, in results that are not reported,
adding indicators for 1999 only or for 1999-2008 does not change the results described
above, and these indicators are never statistically significant. The Master Settlement
Agreement appears to have had no discernable effect on blockbuster punitive damages
awards.
Table 10 reports results from several empirical tests checking the robustness of
our results across different samples. The first equation excludes the Engle case from the
sample, but doing so does not alter the statistical significance of any of the coefficients.
Excluding all cigarette cases likewise yields results that are very similar to the full sample
results. With the five bench trials excluded from the sample, punitive damages are more
responsive to compensatory damages: the comparable elasticities are 0.30 for pre-State
Farm and 0.15 for post-State Farm cases. Also, the level of punitive damages awarded in
cigarette cases is of much higher magnitude in the jury trial only sample: the coefficient
of 3.245 means that punitive damages in cigarette cases, holding fixed compensatory
damages, are 26 times higher than other industry punitive damages (compared to a factor
of 14 for the sample that includes bench awards). The coefficient on the indicator for
individual and business litigants is slightly larger than the full sample results and is now
significant at the 5 percent level in equation 3. Juries award punitive damages that are 68
percent higher to individual plaintiffs in cases in which they are matched against business

45

An indicator for Alabama cases, the second highest in total punitive damage awards, also was never
statistically significant.

27

defendants, compared to 61 percent higher in the full sample (equation 4, Table 8),
perhaps reflecting greater consideration by juries of the relative deepness of the
defendant’s pockets compared to the individual plaintiff’s.
In order to include Garamendi v. Altus Finance, S.A., the case with compensatory
damages equal to 0, we added $1 to the compensatory damages and punitive damages for
each case before logging each variable. There were few changes in the magnitude or
statistical significance of coefficient estimates, but there is a reduction in the coefficient
on ln(compensatory damages). With the Altus Finance award included, the elasticity of
punitive damages with respect to compensatory damages decreases to 0.19 pre-State
Farm and drops to 0.03 for cases decided after the State Farm decision.
A central focus of the U.S. Supreme Court decisions in the State Farm and Exxon
Shipping Co. cases has been on the ratio of punitive damages/compensatory damages.
The regression results in Table 11 examine the determinants of the natural log of this
ratio.46 Due to the outlier status of the ratio of Bullock v. Philip Morris, Inc., we present
equations with and without that case, and in equations 1 and 2 we also include an
indicator for the Engle award due to its unique limitation of compensatory damages
values to the class representatives, as discussed previously. Equation 3 excludes both the
Engle and Bullock awards. In contrast to the level of punitive damage regressions, there is
some weak evidence that bench awards have lower ratios than jury awards, although the
coefficients are not quite statistically significant, with p-values equal to 0.13 using robust
46

Regressions using the level of the ratio rather than the natural log of the ratio yielded no statistically
significant results if the Bullock case is included. Without the Bullock case or without Bullock and Engle
several coefficients are statistically significant. The cigarette industry and the finance, investment,
insurance industry have higher ratios (at the 5 percent level of significance). Violent crime cases and cases
involving individual versus business litigants have higher ratios (at the 10 percent level of significance). In
addition, ratios are lower for cases in the post-State Farm era (at the 10 percent level of significance) using
these subsamples.

28

standard errors. There is some evidence that cases involving some groups of defendants
have higher ratios, specifically cases against the cigarette industry, the finance,
investment and insurance industry, and perpetrators of violent crimes. However, the
cigarette industry coefficient estimate is not statistically significant if the Bullock
cigarette case is excluded. In general, fewer of the industry indicator variables are
statistically significant. The results seem to suggest that in blockbuster punitive damages
cases juries (and judges) are more likely to penalize certain industries by changing the
absolute magnitude of the punitive damages rather than the ratio of punitive to
compensatory damages. The results in Table 11 indicate that cases involving individuals
against a business opponent have a ratio that is 5.7 to 6 times higher than cases involving
only business or government litigants. Consistent with the results from the level of
punitive damages regressions, the State Farm decision has resulted in a decrease of 75
percent in the ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages.

5. An Examination and Simulation of the Effect of U.S. Supreme Court Ratio Limits
The final Table 12 presents a closer examination of the two recent Supreme Court
decisions regarding the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages. The Engle case is
excluded from this analysis once again. Under the 2003 State Farm decision, the Court
indicated that few ratios above a single-digit limit would pass due process. As can be
seen in Panel A of Table 12, 45 cases or 45 percent of the blockbuster punitive awards’
ratios exceed the single-digit limit, where these cases account for 74 percent of the total
punitive damages award amounts, $84.3 billion. If the awards were capped at nine times
the compensatory damages, the total punitive damages awards of those 45 cases would

29

have been $9.6 billion, or about 11 percent of the actual award amounts. This constraint
would have resulted in $39.9 billion in total punitive damages being levied, compared to
the $114.5 billion actual total of punitive damages, so that only 35 percent of the actual
total awards would remain. Under the State Farm single-digit ratio limit, 66 cases can
still be defined as “blockbuster” cases in the sense that their nominal punitive damages
awards are greater than or equal to $100 million with the cap imposed, including 12 cases
whose actual punitive damages awards are over the single-digit ratio limit.
In the 2008 Exxon Shipping Co. decision, a valid ratio, at least for maritime cases,
was limited to 1:1. A more general restriction of the ratio to less than or equal to 1:1
would reduce the awards in 84 cases (or 85 percent of the 99 cases). Limiting punitive
damages awards to be no greater than the compensatory awards would reduce the total
awards of those cases from $99.9 billion to $6.1 billion, and would decrease the overall
blockbuster punitive amount to $20.7 billion, which is 18 percent of the actual total
awards. Under the Exxon Shipping Co. ratio limit, 35 cases or 35 percent of the 99
awards can still be defined as “blockbuster” cases with the cap imposed; this number
includes 20 cases whose actual punitive damages are over the 1:1 limit and 15 cases with
actual ratios less than 1. Adoption of a unitary ratio for punitive damages to
compensatory damages as an upper bound would have far more sweeping effects on
blockbuster awards than a single-digit ratio.

6. Conclusion
Just over two decades ago, blockbuster awards were unprecedented. However,
the upsurge in the number and scale of blockbuster awards may be tapering off from its

30

peak level. A diverse series of statistical analyses indicates that the upward trend in
blockbuster awards may have been dampened by the U.S. Supreme Court’s State Farm
decision. That 2003 decision provides guidelines to limit the ratio of punitive damages to
compensatory damages, suggesting that a single-digit upper limit should be the usual
norm. From 2004 onward, the total number of blockbuster awards per year and the
growth in the total value of the blockbuster awards in any given year tapered off.
Controlling for the total value of compensatory damages in each year, the upward time
trend in these values has been significantly reduced. Also, the magnitude of the
relationship between aggregate punitive damages and compensatory damages in recent
blockbuster cases is almost half that of years prior to the State Farm decision, which is
consistent with the State Farm decision’s focus on bringing punitive damages to be more
in line with the value of compensatory damages.
We find more evidence that the State Farm case has affected punitive damages
awards through examination of the level of the individual awards given that a blockbuster
award has been made, as the elasticity of punitive awards to compensatory awards has
been reduced by more than half. A similar negative effect of the State Farm decision is
found by examining case-specific ratios of punitive damages to compensatory damages.
Capping punitive damages using either of the Supreme Court’s recent ratio limits
in the State Farm decision and the Exxon Shipping Co. decision would have a large
dampening effect on the total amount of blockbuster punitive damages awards and would
eliminate many of the cases from the category of blockbuster cases. If strictly applied,
limiting the ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages to 1:1 would eliminate
about two-thirds of the cases from the $100 million blockbuster category.

31

Analysis of the pattern of blockbuster awards yields a variety of insights into the
performance of the civil justice system more generally. Punitive damages are responsive
to the level of compensatory damages overall, but after controlling for factors such as
industry effects, this relationship is greatly reduced. Instead, the levels of punitive
damages are often driven not by the level of compensatory damages but by the particular
industry involved, as certain types of products and services seem to fare particularly
badly.47 Controlling for the level of compensatory damages, the industries that are
particularly hard hit are: the cigarette industry; the energy and chemical industry; the
finance, investment and insurance industry; and the pharmaceutical and health care
industry. These well known litigation targets tended to fare less well than the automobile
industry or miscellaneous other industry groups. This difference is consistent with
differential effects of the civil justice system for different segments of the economy.
Despite some reduction in the growth of blockbuster punitive awards and in the elasticity
of punitive damages with respect to compensatory damages, case-specific characteristics,
such as the identity of the litigants, result in punitive damages awards that vary greatly
across cases. Many awards remain extremely high by any standard.

47

Empirical tests not reported here also explored whether the nature of the harm—personal injury,
environmental harm, or financial harm—accounted for such a relationship, but these variables were not
statistically significant.
