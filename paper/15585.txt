Discontinuous Behavioral Responses to Recycling Laws and Plastic Water Bottle Deposits

NBER Working Paper No. 15585
December 2009, Revised December 2010

ABSTRACT
Economic theory predicts that individual recycling behavior gravitates toward extremes—either diligent
recycling or no recycling at all. Using a nationally representative sample of 3,158 bottled water users,
this article finds that this prediction is borne out for consumer recycling of plastic water bottles. Both
water bottle deposits and recycling laws foster recycling through a discontinuous effect that converts
reluctant recyclers into diligent recyclers. Within this context, a number of factors influencing recycling
emerge. The warm glow from being both an environmentalist and an environmental group member
is about equal to the monetary value of 5 cent bottle deposits. Respondents from states with stringent
recycling laws and bottle deposits have greater recycling rates. Consistent with recycling being a threshold
response, the efficacy of these policy interventions is greater for those who do not already recycle,
have lower income, and do not consider themselves to be environmentalists.

1. Introduction
Waste associated with plastic water bottles has become an issue of substantial national
prominence. In six years, U.S. sales of bottled water for individual consumption tripled from
about 12 billion water bottles in 2000 to 36 billion in 2006.1 In 2008 alone, U.S. consumption of
bottled water was more than 28 gallons per capita, with industry wholesale dollar sales
exceeding $11 billion.2 Bottled water typically comes in polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
bottles. More than 2 million tons of PET bottles, including those for beverages other than water,
were incinerated or left in landfills in 2006. The Container Recycling Institute estimates that
increasing PET recycling rates to about 85% would save more than 60 trillion BTUs and avoid
about a million metric tons of carbon equivalent greenhouse gas emissions. Plastic water bottles
comprise almost half of the total PET bottle sales and represent a growing share of sales.
However, bottle deposit laws in most states do not include these water bottles. This paper
examines the efficacy of the economic incentives generated by policies that encourage the
recycling of these plastic water bottles.3
There are two principal policy instruments that promote water bottle recycling—bottle
deposits and recycling laws. Bottle deposits for plastic water bottles establish a financial
incentive to foster recycling while recycling laws generally encourage that behavior by reducing
the time cost and increasing the convenience cost of recycling.4 In some instances recycling

We do not analyze whether increased recycling of water bottles would pass a cost-benefit test. Such an analysis
would need to consider the implementation and operating costs of the various policies against the benefits of
reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing landfill space, saving natural resources through the possibility of
reuse, and experiencing the warm glow benefits of recycling. See, e.g., Kinnaman (2006) and Morris, Smith, and
Hlavka (2005). To the extent that a state or a municipality would like to increase its water bottle recycling through a
bottle deposit bill or other recycling law, however, our analysis identifies the impact that each policy is likely to
have on individual recycling behavior.

There also may be financial incentives through penalties imposed for noncompliance if recycling is mandatory.

laws may impose monetary penalties on failure to recycle properly. Recycling laws exhibit a
range of policy stringency, from requiring local recycling to merely defining it as a goal.
While the economics literature on recycling behavior has been growing, this study is
novel in its focus on individual recycling behavior for a nationally representative sample that can
be linked to different recycling law regimes in the fifty U.S. states.5 To date, there have been no
comprehensive studies of plastic water bottle recycling or national studies of individual recycling
behavior. Most studies have focused on states or narrowly defined regions.6 Some studies of
material-specific recycling have used individual data, but have not analyzed the different state
law regimes, have not used nationally representative samples, and have not focused on plastic
water bottles specifically.7
Our study uses an original national data set of 3,158 households. Data at the individual
level make it possible to examine the determinants of recycling decisions controlling for
household characteristics and to examine the different levels of individual recycling rates. Many
of the variables included in our analysis, such as whether the respondent is a member of an
environmental organization, are unique to our recycling study. On a theoretical basis, we predict

Jenkins et al. (2003) and Yang and Innes (2007) review previous empirical recycling studies. Most, but not all
studies in the literature have analyzed recycling behavior on a regional basis. These studies include Fullerton and
Kinnaman (1996), Callan and Thomas (1997), Nester and Podolsky (1998), Hong and Adams (1999), Van Houtven
and Morris (1999), and Suwa and Usui (2007). Kinnaman and Fullerton (2000) examine community-level recycling
behavior using a national dataset, and Jenkins et al. (2003) analyze material specific recycling for a sample in 20
metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) of middle and upper-middle income households who had curbside collection
available. Ashenmiller (2009) used individual survey data from CA to examine the effect of bottle bills and
concluded that they increase recycling.
6
Three such regional studies are Saltzman et al.’s (1993) analysis of glass and newspaper recycling (by quantity) in
53 communities in PA and NJ, Beatty et al.’s (2007) analysis of aluminum, glass, and plastic recycling (by quantity)
in regional CA communities, and Yang and Innes’s (2007) regional Taiwan analysis of paper, metal, plastic, and
glass recycling (by weight).
7
Three studies using household-level data are Reschovsky and Stone’s (1994) analysis of the proportion of many
different materials recycled in an upstate NY county, Sterner and Bartelings’ (1999) analysis of recycling (by
weight) of materials other than plastic using regional data in Sweden, and Jenkins et al.’s (2003) analysis of the
recycling (by proportion recycled) of newspaper, glass bottles, aluminum, plastic bottles, and yard waste by middle
and upper income households in 20 major MSAs. Kinnaman (2005) examines the effect on curbside recycling of
legal contexts categorized by a survey of state officials reported in Biocycle magazine by Kaufman et al. (2004).

that people gravitate toward an extreme of either being a non-recycler or a diligent recycler, a
mechanism which can only be revealed using individual data rather than aggregative data.
The use of individual data also makes it possible to examine the individual heterogeneity
of the recycling responses to the incentives created by the recycling laws and bottle deposit laws
of different states. To capture the incentive effects of these laws, our study uses our own
detailed categorization of state recycling statutes and bottle bills presented in Appendix B. The
data set enables us to answer several kinds of questions. Are some segments of the population
less motivated by recycling policies, and does their responsiveness hinge on the particular form
of intervention? Will those in upper income groups respond to the financial incentives of bottle
deposits or be deterred by the time costs associated with recycling? Differences in individuals’
valuation of the environment also may be consequential if environmentalists already recycle
without additional financial incentives. Our results demonstrate a substantial muting of the
financial incentives for recycling for those with higher income levels and strong environmental
preferences.
The next section of this paper presents a conceptual model of recycling behavior, which
predicts that once people begin to recycle they tend to become diligent recyclers so that
successful policy interventions have a discontinuous effect on individual behavior. After
describing the sample and the recycling policy regimes, Section 3 presents overview statistics
indicating a strong bimodal aspect to recycling behavior. The regression analyses of the
determinants of the fraction of bottles recycled in Section 4 and the use of curbside recycling and
bottle returns in Section 5 provide estimates of the efficacy of the different recycling
interventions. Section 6 presents corroborative results on the effect of bottle deposits based on
the natural experiments in Oregon and Connecticut during the course of survey administration.

Section 7 concludes. Incentives matter, consistent with both economic theory and the
hypothesized discontinuous recycling decision.
2. The Consumer’s Recycling Decision
Recycling decisions depend on what items the consumer has purchased. Following the
standard dynamic programming approach, we assume that in the first stage the consumer chooses
the consumption mix conditional on the optimal disposal and recycling decisions in the second
stage. The consumer makes the purchase decisions in the initial period anticipating optimal
disposal thereafter so that it is appropriate to analyze the second stage disposal and recycling
decision, taking as given the prior purchase decisions.8
Recycling Decision Notation and Framework
Although not all disposal options are available in every locale, if we abstract from
littering, there are three possible ways to dispose of plastic bottles: curb recycling, denoted by c,
returning the bottle for deposits, d, and putting the bottles in the garbage, g. If we denote the total
number of bottles as x, then x = c + d + g. For each bottle returned for deposit, the consumer
receives a unit price p.9
Let the utility for each disposal mode be represented by an additively separable function
of the environmental benefit minus the net cost of disposal. The person’s wage rate, w, reflects
opportunity cost of time.10 We also assume there is no warm glow benefit from bottles that are

8

Similar formats that focus on the recycling stage decision are used by Kinnaman and Fullerton (2000), Jenkins et
al. (2003), and Beatty et al. (2007). Bohm (1981) considers a different model of the refund-disposal decision that
involves the time decision of when to stop using the product and dispose of it. Our analysis assumes that individuals
must choose a way to dispose of their water bottles once they are empty.
9
If the bottles are returned to a recycling center in a no deposit state, the price is zero.
10
For simplicity, we abstract from the exogenous labor supply decision and focus on the wage rate w. Assuming a
fixed predetermined number of hours worked, the wage rate also serves as a measure of the level of income.

4

not recycled but that environmental benefit that the consumer derives for each bottle recycled is
the same whether the bottle is recycled at the curb or returned for deposit.11
For each recycling mode, there is a fixed cost time component as well as a time cost
component that increases linearly with the number of bottles recycled. Thus, the time
commitment tc for recycling c bottles with curbside recycling is
tc = tc0 + tc1c ,

(1)

and for d bottles returned for deposit it is
td = td0 + td1d ,

(2)

and for g bottles put in the garbage it is
tg = tg0 + tg1g .12

(3)

The personal cost of this time commitment is tcw, tdw, and tgw for the three different types of
bottle disposal. States that have effective recycling programs, such as those with convenient
curbside recycling and accessible recycling centers, promote recycling by decreasing the
recycling cost components. In some instances the cost structure may be different, as when
drinking bottled water at a sporting event or while traveling, in which case even diligent
recyclers may not find it desirable to recycle their bottles.
The attractiveness of any recycling option will depend on the other choices available and
whether the particular recycling mode is already being used, in which case the fixed cost
component of the time cost drops out. There are many commonalities across the different
recycling options, and these general economic aspects of the decision will be our focus here
rather than attempting to inventory results for every disposal combination.

11

This benefit term may, of course, vary with demographic characteristics such as whether the person is a member of
an environmental group. Kinnaman (2006) provides an overview of the literature on the utility benefit of recycling.
12
The linearity assumption in this model is the key assumption leading to the corner solution outcome.

5

Curbside Recycling Versus Garbage
The recycling decisions in different contexts involve similar economic issues that can be
illustrated by considering the binary decision of whether to recycle n bottles curbside or to put
the bottles in the garbage, where we assume that this is the initial disposal for each mode.13
Curbside recycling will be more attractive if
en – (tc0 + tc1n)w > -(tg0 + tg1n)w .

(4)

Recycling at the curbside is preferable if the environmental benefit exceeds any net cost in
disposal time, or
en > [(tc0 – tg0) + (tc1 – tg1)n]w .

(5)

How much people will choose to recycle will depend on a succession of marginal
choices, but it may be preferable to adopt a common recycling strategy for all bottles. Suppose
that it is desirable for a consumer to recycle n bottles at the curb, and that the consumer already
uses garbage disposal for other items so that tg0 = 0.14 Then the overall comparison of the
benefits of recycling these n bottles rather than putting them in the garbage is
en – (tc0 + tc1n)w > -tg1nw,

or

If the consumer already uses the garbage disposal mode for other items, tg0 = 0.

(10)

if inequality 7 is satisfied so that it is desirable to recycle n bottles, then it will also be desirable
to recycle n + 1 bottles. Because of the small incremental cost of recycling an additional bottle,
consumers will tend to gravitate to corner solutions of no recycling or complete recycling.
Returning bottles for deposit as opposed to disposing of the bottles in the garbage also leads to a
similar corner solution, as does the decision to use curbside recycling or to return the bottles for
deposit.
Empirical Predictions
This exploration of recycling decisions has led to several empirical predictions. First,
people will exhibit discrete modal choices in their recycling behavior. Thus, to the extent that
policies such as curbside recycling laws or bottle deposit laws are influential, people will switch
from doing little or no recycling of that type to using that mode almost exclusively. Because of
this discontinuous response, there should be few individuals with intermediate levels of recycling
for any particular recycling mode. Second, placing a high value on the warm glow effect
increases the attractiveness of recycling by curbside or through bottle returns as compared to
putting the bottles in the garbage. If the environmental utility value is identical for both
recycling and returns, this environmental benefit component will not have a differential effect
across those domains. Third, bottle deposits increase the likelihood of recycling bottles.
3. Sample Characteristics and Recycling Laws
The data set used in the empirical analysis is from a national survey of households
undertaken for this study by Knowledge Networks (KN) in 2008 and 2009. The KN panel is
based on probability sampling of both online and offline populations. If a person does not have
internet access or a computer, KN provides the necessary hardware and internet access. Our
7

survey is Web-based and was administered to a nationally representative sample, with a 71%
response rate.15 The characteristics of the full sample, as reported in Appendix Table A1, closely
parallel the characteristics of the adult U.S. population. Of the 5,213 survey participants, 3,158
are bottled water users.16 Based on the summary of the sample characteristics in Table A1,
bottled water consumption is quite widespread across the population. Compared to those who do
not drink bottled water, bottled water drinkers are more likely to be female, younger, nonwhite,
and have high income. Our empirical analysis focuses on the bottled water subsample, because
this is the population for which the recycling decision is pertinent. While the entire survey took
around 25 minutes, the sections on individual attitudes and practices related to bottled water and
recycling took less than 10 minutes. Appendix Table A2 summarizes the pertinent survey
questions.
While the data only pertain to the amounts of plastic water bottles recycled, the survey
did include a recycling question that asked respondents to compare their recycling of all
recyclable materials relative to their neighbors. As indicated by the data in Appendix Table C1,
the self-assessed relative degree of recycling is similar for bottled water users and those who do
not drink bottled water. The main result of interest is that the distribution across response
categories is remarkably similar for those in the plastic water bottle sample and for those not in
this group suggesting that an analysis of recycling aluminum cans or newspapers would produce
similar results.

15

Our use of KN for our EPA-funded water surveys has been specifically reviewed and approved by the Office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs, U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The KN panel also meets the
U.S. government’s quality standards for RDD surveys. For additional information on the characteristics of the KN
panel, see http://www.knowledgenetworks.com/knpanel/KNPanel-Design-Summary.pdf.
16
To be classified as a bottled water user the person must meet two tests. First, the person must “use bottled water
at home, work, exercise, car, or other.” Second, the person must have “bought water in plastic bottles in the past
month.”

8

The focus of our analysis is on the recycling of plastic bottles for bottled water. As a
result, we restrict the sample to the 3,158 people who indicated that they use bottled water.17 The
focal recycling question for the plastic bottles was the following: “Out of every 10 plastic bottles,
how many would you say that you recycled or returned for reuse?” On average, the sample
members indicated they recycled or returned a mean of 6.0 out of 10 plastic water bottles. This
amount is greater than the U.S. Government Accountability Office’s (GAO) report of an estimate
of total plastic bottle recycling rate of 24% in 2006 based on data from the National Association
of PET Container Resources, which reports a 27% estimate for 2008.18 However, those statistics
do not pertain to the household recycling rate of plastic water bottles, which is the focus of our
study. The relatively low national recycling rate figures also include the 69.1% of all bottled
water that is consumed away from home at restaurants, workplaces, hotels, sporting events,
conventions, and other locales.19 As indicated below, our household recycling patterns are
comparable to those found by Jenkins et al. (2003) for areas with curbside recycling for some
materials.20 If, however, all sample respondents overstated their recycling rate relative to the
GAO figure by a common factor, one would multiply all recycling rates by 0.45.
The matter of interest is less on the average recycling rates than on how reported bottle
return rate varies with the different recycling and deposit regimes and, in particular, whether the
economic incentives created by these regimes influence recycling behavior. Consideration of
17

The sample is restricted to the 3,158 respondents who indicated how often they recycle their bottles. Many of the
excluded respondents used water cooler containers that were collected on a regular basis by the supplier and
consequently did not involve the same kind of recycling decisions being analyzed here.
18
The U.S. Government Accountability Office (2009) indicated that it “did not independently verify the accuracy
and completeness of the data provided by [the environmental nonprofit] organizations.” The National Association
of PET Container Resources report, which provides the details for the estimate, is available at
http://www.napcor.com/pdf/RRate2008.pdf.
19
See http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/err1/err1a.pdf.
20
Jenkins et al. (2003) found that the majority of respondents recycled over 95% of plastic bottles. Our results
similarly show that a majority of respondents recycle 9 or 10 out of 10 plastic bottles. Additionally, the findings of
Jenkins et al. suggest a plastic bottle recycling rate of around 69% using the midpoints of their reported ranges, a
number similar to our 60% result.

9

relative gradations of recycling behavior in our empirical analysis should be less susceptible to
reporting bias than statements of the absolute number of bottles recycled.
Table 1 summarizes the sample characteristics of the variables used in the analysis. In
addition to data on recycling practices and state laws, the data include detailed personal
characteristic information. Over two-fifths of the sample consider themselves to be
environmentalists and 8% are members of national environmental groups.21 This proportion is
similar for both bottled water users and non-bottle water users. Bottled water users spend about
$11 per month on bottled water, while non-bottled water users spend no money at all, leading to
a sample spending average of just under $8 per month on bottled water.
States differ by the extent to which they encourage recycling either through bottle deposit
laws and their specific recycling policies. Bottle deposits create a direct financial incentive for
recycling bottles for which deposits are required, which in most states do not include plastic
water bottles.22 The deposit rate is 5 cents per bottle, except in Michigan where the rate is 10
cents.23 The unit price deposit raises the price paid at the time of purchase, but for every bottle
returned to a recycling location or to stores that accept recycled bottles, the recycler is paid the
deposit amount. The bottle can be recycled by anyone and need not be recycled by the original
purchaser.24 About 16% of the sample members reside in the states with non-water bottle
deposit laws, and only 12% of the sample resides in the five states (California, Connecticut,
Hawaii, Maine, and Oregon) that had bottle deposit laws in 2009 that included plastic water
bottles.
21

These groups included Environmental Defense Fund, Greenpeace, National Audubon Society, National Wildlife
Federation, Nature Conservancy, Natural Resources Defense Council, and Sierra Club.
22
See Bohm (1981) for an early detailed analysis of deposit-refund systems.
23
Separate analyses failed to demonstrate any differential effect of the higher bottle deposits in Michigan.
24
For example, homeless people and scavengers often collect bottles from litter, garbage, and curbside recycling
bins and return the bottles for cash. This leeway no doubt contributes to the role of bottle deposits as an income
supplement for the poor, which in turn decreases crime rates. See Ashenmiller (2006, 2009, 2010).

10

The survey inquired whether the respondent received payment for plastic bottle recycling.
The survey responses follow the expected pattern given the bottle deposit regime in the
respondent’s state of residence. The theory developed earlier suggests that bottle deposit
requirements for other types of bottles will increase the recycling of water bottles. We will test
whether bottle deposits lead consumers to sort their garbage and bring the bottles for which there
are deposits to a recycling center. To the extent that there are fixed costs associated with
returning bottles to a recycling center, the additional costs of also bringing the plastic water
bottles may be less than if there were no bottle deposit policies. Recycling centers in states with
bottle deposit requirements may also include opportunities to recycle plastic water bottles even
though there is no payment for such recycling.
There is substantial diversity in the structure of recycling laws across states. State laws
often include one or more regulatory components, summarized in Appendix B. For example, a
state with mandatory recycling may also include recycling goals. For purposes of categorization,
we treat states hierarchically in terms of the most stringent component in the state’s recycling
law. States are grouped into those that have mandatory recycling or that require an opportunity
for recycling for all citizens, those that require local communities to have a recycling plan, those
that have recycling goals but lack a specific plan, and, finally, those that have no recycling law.
Our empirical analysis indicates that recycling goals alone do not have a statistically
significant positive effect on recycling whereas the other three recycling laws do. Thus, for
purposes of our first two overview tables we will denote “effective recycling laws” as those
states with mandatory recycling, opportunities for recycling, or regional waste management
plans with recycling considerations.

11

Table 2 summarizes the recycling practices for water bottle users under different
recycling regimes. The average number of bottles out of 10 that are recycled rises from 4.30 for
states with no effective recycling law and no water bottle deposit law to 5.86 if the state also has
an effective recycling law and to 8.59 if the state also has a water bottle deposit law. All states
with a water bottle deposit law also have an effective recycling law.
The most prevalent form of recycling is at curbside. Almost half of all water bottle users
use curbside recycling for some of their bottles, while only one-fifth of the sample returns bottles
for deposit or takes them to a recycling center. In states with water bottle deposit laws, about
half return the bottles for deposit, and the percentage using curbside recycling is not substantially
lower than in states without such bottle deposit laws.
The distribution of the number of bottles recycled shown in Table 3 is consistent with the
theoretical model in which recycling behavior follows a discrete threshold rather than a
continuous process. For all bottled water users, 29.1% recycle 0 bottles out of 10, while 42.0%
recycle 10 out of 10. The next most prevalent levels of recycling are 9 and 8 bottles out of 10, as
people attempt to recycle most but not all of their bottles, perhaps because they are drinking the
water in the car or at some other location. Interestingly, there is minimal clustering of responses
at 5 out of 10, which one might have expected if respondents were focusing on salient numerical
responses rather than attempting to assess their actual recycling amount.
Columns 2-4 in Table 3 break the sample by three recycling regime categories. The first
recycling policy shown in column 3 of Table 3 is the presence of an effective recycling law but
no water bottle deposit law. Such a law shifts the mass of the distribution, decreasing the
percentage of respondents who indicate that they do not recycle at all, and increasing the
percentage who indicate 100% recycling. As column 5 indicates, almost the entire mass shift is

12

from 0 out of 10 bottles recycled to 9 or 10 bottles recycled. The addition of water bottle
deposits is shown in column 4. As the calculation of the differences in column 6 indicates, there
is a negligible incremental effect of water bottle deposits except at the tails of the distribution,
where the percent of those indicating zero recycling drops by 24.7 percentage points and the
percent indicating complete recycling increases by 26.2 points. 25
The consistent pattern across all these results is that most people adopt a recycling
strategy of either being a diligent recycler or not recycling at all. The introduction of effective
recycling laws or water bottle deposit laws consequently has a discontinuous effect across the
distribution of recycling patterns as water bottle users shift recycling levels through a threshold
transformation of behavior.
4. Determinants of the Total Recycling Amount
The first series of regression analyses focuses on the proportion of water bottles recycled.
To demonstrate robustness across analyses, four different estimation approaches are used. The
first column in Table 4 presents ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates for which we report
robust heteroskedasticity-corrected standard errors. To take into account the bounded nature of
the responses that cluster at 0 and 10, the second column of Table 4 presents the two-sided Tobit
regression estimates. Finally, one might hypothesize that respondents were not giving precise
estimates of the actual number of bottles recycled but were simply indicating their relative
degree of recycling and perhaps overstating the actual number of bottles recycled. We explore

25

This efficacy of water bottle deposits is consistent with Ashenmiller’s (2009) finding that bottle deposit laws
increase the amount of material recycled at Santa Barbara, CA redemption centers. Beatty et al. (2007) find that
curbside recycling largely cannibalizes the effect of drop-off recycling centers when incomes are high or
unemployment is low. Their analysis is within state for California, but if the comparison instead is with states with
no effective recycling law, then the incremental effect of such recycling policies potentially may be greater. Several
previous studies focused on bag/tag programs and pricing by weight programs. Reschovsky and Stone (1994),
Fullerton and Kinnaman (1996), Kinnaman and Fullerton (2000), and Jenkins et al. (2003) found no statistically
significant effect of unit pricing on recycling. Van Houtven and Morris (1999) found that unit pricing affected
whether people recycle but not the amount of recycling.

13

this possibility in two ways. The third column of results in Table 4 presents the ordered logit
estimates, for which the three ordered categories are 0, 1-7, and 8-10 out of 10 bottles. The final
column of Table 4 reports probit estimates, for which the dependent binary variable is equal to 1
if the individual recycles 1-10 out of 10 bottles and 0 if the individual does not recycle any
bottles.26 These formulations of the model address the possibility that the responses have ordinal
rather than cardinal significance or are binary, indicating only whether someone is a recycler or
not.27 Moreover, the categories reflect the different discontinuous recycling groupings of
consumers. Because of the strong parallels across the four analyses, the discussion here focuses
on the OLS estimates where the coefficients reflect the linear impact of the variable on recycling
behavior.
The first pair of policy variables pertains to the state’s bottle deposit laws. The deposit
state variable is a 0-1 indicator variable for whether the state has a bottle deposit law. A second
0-1 variable then indicates if the deposit law covers water bottles. Both of the state deposit
variables raise the number of bottles recycled. The broad deposit variable raises the number of
water bottles recycled number by 0.6 out of 10 bottles, while the presence of a specific water
bottle deposit law increases plastic water bottle recycling by 2.1 out of 10 bottles. Together,
consumers in states with both laws recycle an additional 2.7 out of 10 bottles, controlling for all
other influences, including the recycling law regime.
The next set of three variables pertains to the state recycling law. The two most stringent
forms of laws—mandatory recycling and required opportunities for recycling—are combined
into a single category of 14 states plus the District of Columbia because the small number of the
26

Other ordered logit specifications yielded similar results. For example, treating each of the 0 to 10 responses as a
separate ordered response leads to estimates that have the same signs and statistical significance as those reported
here.
27
Jenkins et al. (2003) also use an ordered logit approach to analyze categorical responses for recycling behavior
that they collapsed into three gradations of recycling rates. Similarly, Halvorsen (2008) uses an ordered probit
model.

14

component groups makes it impossible to reject the hypothesis that the coefficients for these two
categories are equal.28 These laws should have the greatest influence since they have the greatest
effect on the costs of recycling as they make available low cost recycling options, and in the case
of mandatory recycling, impose penalties on those who fail to recycle. Laws that require either
mandatory recycling or the opportunity to recycle increase recycling by 1.9 out of every 10
bottles.
Laws that only require regional waste management plans with recycling considerations
also have a significant positive effect on recycling, boosting the recycling out of 10 bottles by 0.7
bottles. This effect has a significantly smaller point estimate than of the 1.9 effect of the more
stringent mandatory/opportunity recycling laws.29
The weakest of the recycling law variables is for states that have a waste reduction goal,
but no required action. This variable does not have a statistically significant effect compared to
the no recycling law states.30 The pattern of coefficient magnitudes is consistent with the relative
stringency of the laws. Mandatory recycling and required recycling opportunity laws have the
greatest effect, followed by planning laws, with no statistically significant effect of the weakest
laws that are limited to specifying a waste reduction goal. Because of the significant effects on
recycling of mandatory/opportunity laws and planning regimes we refer to these as the effective
recycling laws.
Next we consider user demographics on recycling. Higher income levels increase the
time opportunity costs of recycling. Income may also influence the value the consumer places
on recycling. The effect of income on the number of bottles recycled is positive, but small,
28

The F test had a value of 1.66 with a probability value of 0.1977. Similarly, Jenkins et al. (2003) found that for
plastic bottles generally, mandatory recycling had no additional effect when curbside recycling is already available.
29
The pertinent F value is 32.40, with a probability value 0.0000.
30
Planning states are more effective than goals states. The F statistic for the test for whether the planning variable
coefficient equals that of the goals variable is 9.81, with a probability value of 0.0017.

15

suggesting that the increased opportunity costs are not sufficient to totally offset the higher
amount of recycling among higher income respondents.31

Individual education has a positive

effect on recycling, which serves both as a measure of the respondent’s knowledge of available
recycling options as well as lifetime wealth.32
The value that the respondents place on environmental quality is captured directly by
whether the respondents consider themselves to be environmentalists as well as by whether the
respondent is a member of a major national environmental organization.33 Each of these
variables has the expected positive effect, with people who consider themselves to be
environmentalists recycling an additional 1.6 out of 10 bottles, and members of environmental
organizations recycling an additional 0.5 bottles after taking into account the effect of being an
environmentalist and other variables.
To the extent that these environmental variables correspond to the warm glow benefit
from recycling, then it is possible to monetize this effect. The water bottle deposit variable
reflects the inducement of a 5 cent per bottle payment. Being a self-described environmentalist
is 77% as influential, or equivalent to about a 4 cent per bottle value, while being a member of an
environmental organization is 21% as effective, or a value of about 1 cent per bottle. Since
environmental organization members are also self-described environmentalist, their combined
warm glow benefit is 5 cents per bottle, or almost equivalent to the effect of the bottle deposit.
Several of the other personal characteristic variables are influential as well. Recycling
rates increase with age, are lower for African Americans, and are higher for larger households.
31

Higher income respondents may also live in communities with more access to recycling options that minimize
opportunity costs (income is positively correlated with curbside recycling).
32
In contrast, income and education did not significantly affect plastic bottle recycling in Jenkins et al.’s (2003)
study that was restricted to primarily middle and upper income groups. Collins et al. (2006) found that recycling
rates increase with income in Scotland. Kinnaman (2005) found no significant effect of the percent of state residents
with a high school diploma on the percent of state waste that is recycled.
33
Previous studies concerned with the household’s pro-environment preferences include Halvorsen’s (2008) study
of recycling in Norway.

16

Recycling rates increase for homeowners, but that may reflect the greater availability of curbside
recycling and convenient recycling locations for this group. The volume of recycling as
measured by the dollars spent on bottled water does not have a significant effect on the percent
of bottles recycled, but including this variable nevertheless serves an important role in the
analysis to account for the volume of bottled water purchased.34 Otherwise, variables such as
income might be capturing the quantity effect. Use of bottled water in the car does not
significantly reduce recycling even though recycling may be more difficult for such users, and
reusing water bottles does not affect the recycling rate.
The regional variables are influential and indicate the considerable geographic
differences in recycling rates. Urban and suburban residents of metropolitan statistical areas
(MSAs) recycle an additional 1.3 out of 10 additional bottles, a result consistent with the greater
availability of curbside recycling and convenient recycling centers in such locales. In addition,
state laws generally exempt rural areas from recycling requirements.
To explore these differences further, Appendix Table C2 reports separate regressions for
the urban (MSA) and non-urban subsamples.35 The principal differences are that state deposit
laws and state recycling planning requirements significantly increase plastic water bottle
recycling in urban areas but not outside of these areas. Plastic water bottle deposits are equally
effective in each context.
The efficacy of the policy measures in promoting recycling behavior also may vary
across the populations and in different policy regimes. Table 5 reports selected coefficients from
additional regressions including interactions of the policy variables and both income and whether
the respondent is an environmentalist. Given a threshold model, we expect negative interactions
34

The dollars spent variable remains statistically insignificant if the income variable is omitted from the equation.
The estimated parameters from the two regressions differ statistically, with an F (32, 3094) statistic of 3.30 and a
probability value of 0.0000.
35

17

between positive factors, because either one can drive one over the threshold. The negative
interactive effect of income and water bottle deposit laws implies that higher income people are
less likely to recycle their bottles.36 Having a water bottle deposit law also reduces the marginal
effect of being an environmentalist by more than a half.37 Because environmentalists will
already have an incentive to recycle without a financial inducement, bottle bills are less effective
among this group. On balance, the self described environmentalists return 0.7 additional bottles
out of 10 in states with bottled water deposit laws. The separate regressions for
environmentalists and non-environmentalists reported in Appendix Table C2 indicate many
parallels in behavior with one notable difference being that the financial inducements of general
state deposit laws do not significantly boost plastic water bottle recycling for environmentalists,
but are effective for non-environmentalists.38 The other interaction terms in Table 5 are not
statistically significant, as the effect of the water bottle deposit variable on recycling exhibits
more individual heterogeneity than do the other recycling law variables.
5. Determinants of Curbside Recycling and Returning Bottles for Deposit
While both recycling laws and bottle deposit laws should each increase the degree to
which people recycle plastic water bottles, the composition of the recycling should differ. Laws
that increase the availability of curb pickups reduce the costs of curb recycling relative to
returning the bottles to a recycling center and should have a positive effect on curb recycling and
a negative effect on returning bottles for deposit. Likewise, water bottle deposit laws increase
the economic benefits of returning bottles for deposit, consequently increasing the likelihood of
returning the bottles and decreasing the attractiveness of using curbside pickup for which there is
36

The income effect pattern is consistent with Ashenmiller’s (2009) finding that bottle returns are a relatively more
important income source for people in lower income groups.
37
A comparable interaction with being a member of an environmental organization did not have a statistically
significant effect and is not included in Table 5’s regressions.
38
One can reject the hypothesis that the estimated parameters from the two regressions are the same, with an F (31,
3080) statistic of 6.21 and a probability value of 0.0000.

18

no payment. The analysis below tests these propositions by focusing on respondent answers to a
question regarding two forms of recycling behavior over the past month.39
The probit regression for whether the respondent used curbside recycling for plastic water
bottles in the past month is reported in Table 6, where all coefficients have been transformed to
reflect marginal probabilities. State deposit laws generally do not significantly affect curbside
recycling. Residents of states that have mandatory recycling or opportunity for recycling laws
have a 0.26 higher probability of using curbside recycling for plastic water bottles, while states
with recycling plans have a 0.07 higher probability of using curbside recycling than residents of
states with no recycling laws. The presence of recycling goals has no statistically significant
effect on use of curbside recycling.40
Many of the other patterns shown in Table 6 parallel the earlier results with respect to the
number of bottles recycled. All recycling laws variables except for those restricted to recycling
goals boost curbside recycling. The use of curbside recycling is an increasing function of
income, education, age, whether the respondent is an environmentalist, and whether the
respondent lives in a MSA.
We also interacted the various legal and policy regimes with income and whether the
individual is an environmentalist. The mean interaction effect between mandatory or
opportunity laws and whether the respondent is an environmentalist on curbside recycling is
about 0.01 with a standard error of 0.04 and z-statistic of 0.351. The interaction effect ranged,
however, from a negative 0.04 to a positive 0.06, with the z-statistic as high as 2.429 for some

39

See Appendix Table A2 for the survey question wording.
Kinnaman (2005) found that mandatory beverage container deposits and recycling goals do not significantly affect
the availability of curbside recycling, while laws imposing curbside recycling requirements do increase the
availability of curbside recycling. Additionally, he found no statistically significant effects on the availability of
curbside recycling of several other laws: bans on yard waste from landfills, bans of recyclable materials from
landfills, tax credits for facilities, or requirements that government agencies purchase recycled material.
40

19

probability levels of using curbside recycling.41 The other interaction effects were never
statistically significant.
The presence of bottle deposits for plastic water bottles should foster the returns of these
bottles. Table 7 includes three sets of probit estimates for the probability that the respondent
returns bottles for deposit or to the recycling center and for the two components of this
probability—whether the respondent returned the bottles for deposit, presumably to a store
where such bottles are purchased, and when the respondent returned the bottles to a recycling
center.
The overall return probability for plastic bottles increases by 0.10 if the state is a general
bottle deposit state. Since all plastic water bottle states also require deposits for other bottles, the
additional 0.15 probability of bottle returns in a water bottle deposit state implies an overall 0.25
probability of returning plastic water bottles in states with water bottle deposits. Financial
incentives to return bottles are effective, and the presence of other deposit requirements also
boosts the return rate because there will be a greater total payoff to bottle returns. In terms of the
composition of the influence, the water bottle deposit variable has a much stronger influence on
returning bottles to the recycling center than it does on returning bottles for deposit. This greater
marginal effect may be because returning bottles for deposit to the store does not involve
additional fixed costs if a trip was already planned for shopping.
Bottles recycled at curbside will not give consumers a financial payoff, but the presence
of curbside recycling in providing the environmental benefit may reduce the relative utility of
returning the bottles. Indeed, for respondents in states with the strongest recycling laws that
provide for mandatory recycling or the opportunity to recycle, there is a 0.04 lower probability of
returning the bottles to a recycling center or for a deposit. This effect reduces the benefit of
41

This analysis uses the Stata command “inteff” per Norton, Wang, and Ai (2004).

20

water bottle deposits by about one-fourth. Recycling planning law states have a small significant
negative effect on returns for deposit.
The principal demographic factors that influence deposit returns are income and whether
the respondent is an environmentalist. Income has a negative effect because the time cost of
bottle returns is higher and the financial gains from returning bottles for money are less
consequential for those in higher income groups. Environmentalists are more likely to return the
bottles for deposit. Finally, the interaction results indicate that being an environmentalist and
having higher income reduces the average efficacy of water bottle deposits on returning bottles
for deposit or returning bottles to a recycling center.42
6. Effects of Law Changes
The results indicate that recycling rates are higher in states with stringent recycling law or
deposit policies. It is possible, however, that states that initiated more stringent or expansive
legal measures already had many diligent recyclers, though the empirical analysis controlled for
many contributing factors such as whether the person is an environmentalist. To investigate this
question of causation, we take advantage of two legal changes that occurred during the
administration of the survey. Specifically, Oregon and Connecticut both added water bottles to
their deposit bills in 2009. The sample from these states includes 68 observations from 2008 and
37 from 2009, thus providing data on recycling behavior for Oregon and Connecticut both before
and after they each implemented their expanded bottle bills. Although the sample of households
experiencing changes is modest, the results are consistent with previous evidence of recycling
responses to plastic water bottle deposits.
42

The inteff command calculates the mean interaction effect of water deposits and being an environmentalist as
-0.084 with mean standard error 0.048 and mean z-statistic -1.730. The mean interaction effect of water deposits
and having higher income is -0.007 with mean standard error 0.005 and mean z-statistic -1.285. We also interacted
water deposits with mandatory/opportunity laws but we do not report the results because the negative interaction
coefficient was never statistically significant.

21

Oregon
Oregon implemented its bottle bill expansion on January 1, 2009. The sample includes
38 individuals before the expansion and 14 individuals surveyed in October 2009, nine months
after the expansion. Table 8 summarizes the bottle recycling breakdown for those two groups.
After the expansion, mean water bottle recycling increased from 7.2 to 8.5 bottles out of 10.
Specifically, about 13% more people became diligent recyclers after the change. Analysis of
differences in recycling rates within Oregon before and after the bottle deposit law, however,
indicates that the changes are not statistically significant.43 As with the earlier results, there is a
pronounced shift in the mass of the distribution from people who did not recycle at all to the
diligent recycling group. Table 9 presents the difference-in-difference regression results.
Although the interaction term between 2009 and Oregon has a positive coefficient, it is not
statistically significant at the usual levels for the analysis of the number out of 10 bottles
recycled.
The percentage of respondents who return their bottles for deposit exhibits a remarkable
shift after the introduction of plastic water bottle deposits. As indicated by the data in the final
column of Table 8, that percentage rises by almost 50 percent. Moreover, the difference-indifference analysis of the probability of returning bottles for deposit in Table 9 also indicates a
positive and statistically significant effect of introducing plastic water bottle deposits.44
Connecticut
Connecticut’s bottle bill expansion was implemented on October 1, 2009. The sample
included information from Connecticut residents between October 16 and October 27 in 2009,
43

The t-statistic was -1.08, with a one-sided test probability value of 0.1421.
The notes to Table 9 summarize the return for deposit inteff results, which are consistent with the results for the
simple means tests. The decrease in the number of respondents indicating that they curb recycle was not statistically
significant.
44

22

resulting in 30 CT individuals before the change and 23 individuals about two weeks after the
enactment of plastic water bottle deposits. Consequently, there may not have been sufficient
time for the full effects of the policy change to be manifested, as 13 of the 23 people were
interviewed only two weeks after the change. Of the 23 individuals interviewed after the change,
9 of these answered questions on their recycling behavior both before and after the change.
There is evidence of substantial awareness of the policy shift as 21 out of the 23 interviewed
after the change indicated that they were aware that Connecticut recently included water bottles
in its deposit bill.
Table 8 summarizes the recycling behavior in Connecticut before and after the change.45
The level of recycling in CT increased from 8.0 to about 9.0 bottles out of 10, although this
change was not statistically significant.46 The increase in the frequency of diligent recyclers who
recycle 8-10 out of 10 bottles exceeded the increase in the non-recycling percentage.
Pooled Oregon and Connecticut Experiments
Pooling the results from CT and OR increases the number of people who experienced the
policy shift of the introduction of water bottle deposits. The mean increase in recycling rates
shown in Table 8 is statistically significant.47 The differences-in-differences regressions for both
the number of bottles recycled and whether people return bottles for deposit both indicate effects
consistent with the efficacy of water bottle deposits. The regressions for the number of bottles
recycled out of 10 in Table 9 yield interaction effects that exceed the estimated standard errors,
and recycling rates are higher in CT and OR in 2009 in the Tobit results at about the 0.10 level,
45

We also analyzed the Connecticut residents that were aware of the change and the nine individuals interviewed
before and after the change. The composition of the results was similar to the composition for the overall sample
from Connecticut, and also not significant, so we do not report those in Table 8.
46
The t-statistic was 1.16, with a one-sided test probability value of 0.1261. The increase in the number of
respondents indicating that they return bottles for deposit after the bottle bill extension was also not statistically
significant, with a t-statistic of 0.27 and a one-sided test probability value of 0.3933. Changes in the number of
respondents indicating that they curb recycle are also not statistically significant.
47
The t-statistic was 1.76, with a two-sided test probability value of 0.0806.

23

one-sided test.48 A much stronger indication of the efficacy of the plastic water bottle deposits is
the results in Table 9 for whether the respondent returned the bottles for deposit. The interaction
of the 2009 variable with the two states that introduced this policy is positive and statistically
significant at the usual level.
The overall thrust of the analysis of the water bottle deposit experiments is to reinforce
the implications of the earlier cross sectional results. The observed patterns of changes in
recycling behavior are consistent with the efficacy of the bottle deposit policies. The statistical
significance of the effects for the pooled OR and CT samples in the differences-in-differences
analysis is quite striking given that only 37 members of the sample of 3,158 experienced the
policy change, and 23 of these 37 are from CT, where the policy was implemented at the start of
the survey month.
7. Conclusion
Water bottle deposits and recycling laws foster recycling efforts in different ways. The
bottle deposits provide a financial inducement to recycle, while the recycling laws reduce the
time costs by providing curbside recycling and convenient recycling centers. Recycling laws
also may include financial penalties for noncompliance. We find both water bottle deposits and
recycling laws to be effective. Moreover, the strength of effects for the recycling laws follows
the degree of stringency of these measures.
The analysis of the interaction between factors testifies to the diminishing marginal
efficacy of recycling incentives as predicted by a threshold model of response at the individual
level. Mandatory recycling laws offer only modest recycling gains compared to planning laws.
Self-described environmentalists are more likely to recycle without bottle deposits so that these

24

interventions have less effect on their recycling behavior than on less environmentally oriented
respondents. For people in upper income groups, the financial inducements provided by bottle
deposits are less effective, and the time costs of taking bottles to recycling centers loom large.
The central role of economic analysis in predicting the consumer response manifests
perhaps most clearly in the stark pattern of individual recycling activity. For most policy
interventions, one would expect modest policy impacts throughout the range of behavior. Thus,
non-recyclers would become modest recyclers, and modest recyclers would become more
diligent recyclers. This kind of continuous policy influence is not borne out empirically.
Instead, the observed shifts reflect starker changes in behavior that are consistent with the
economic structure of the recycling decision and how policies will influence this decision.
Given the high fixed costs associated with recycling efforts, the hypothesis generated from
rational economic behavior theory is that people will tend to gravitate toward extremes in their
efforts, recycling either a few or most of their bottles. Empirically, this prediction is borne out,
as there are few intermediate recyclers. Both recycling laws and bottle deposit laws have
discontinuous effects on recycling behavior. In each case, the measures have a transformative
effect, shifting individual consumers from not recycling at all to becoming committed recyclers.
Consistent with our result that people respond in a discontinuous manner to recycling incentives,
policies have their greatest effect among those who would not already choose to recycle.

Appendix B: Bottle Deposit Laws and State Recycling Laws

Concerns about diminishing landfill space have prompted many states to pass legislation
encouraging recycling.49 States with the highest disposal fees and limited amounts of disposal
capacity remaining were the first to pass waste reduction legislation. The legislation has taken
various forms in different states; states have set waste reduction goals, required comprehensive
local planning, adopted disposal bans, enacted mandatory provisions for source separation and
curbside recycling, and required refundable deposits on containers.
Bottle Deposit Laws
A bottle deposit bill, or container deposit law, requires a refundable deposit on beverage
containers, usually about 5 to 10 cents, and encourages consumers to return these containers for
recycling to receive their deposit back.50 As of 2009, eleven states—California, Connecticut,
Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Oregon, and Vermont—
have bottle deposit laws. These states represent 29% of the U.S. population and 28% of our
sample. In our survey, five of these states—California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, and
Oregon—included deposits on bottled water in their regulatory scheme.51 Most states have a
modest 5 cent deposit on beverages; only Michigan has a 10 cent deposit on all covered
beverages. Six states retain the unredeemed deposits, which provide state revenue in the
millions.52 Many states without bottle deposit bills are contemplating such legislation. Seven
states considered new deposit bills and three states considered updates to their existing deposit
49

For discussion of the legal and policy context for the emergence of recycling laws see Tchobanoglous and Kreith
(2002) and Gaba and Stever (2008).
50
The exact deposit system can vary from state to state. The Bottle Bill Resource Guide,
www.bottlebill.org/about.htm, provides information on each state’s bottle bill.
51
Connecticut’s addition of bottled water to its bottle deposit scheme was implemented on October 1, 2009. New
York had already passed a bill that would add bottled water, but a court order delayed implementation of this bill
until October 30, 2009, which was after the final round of the survey used for this paper.
52
This statistic includes Michigan, which has a mixed system, but does not include New York, which passed a bill
that would create a mixed system, but implementation of this bill was delayed to past the scope of this paper.

49

bills in 2009.53 Connecticut and New York both passed updated bills allowing the state to retain
unredeemed deposits.54 While Connecticut’s update has already been implemented, New York’s
update has been delayed by a court ruling.55 The seven states with new deposit bill proposals
were Florida, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Tennessee, and West
Virginia. Most of these state bills proposed bottle deposits of at least 10 cents—with Florida’s
bill proposing 20 to 30 cent deposits.56 Florida’s bill is the only bill to propose that bottlers
retain unclaimed deposits; the rest proposed that the state retains unredeemed deposits.57 All
proposed laws, except New Hampshire’s, would cover water bottles.
State Recycling Laws
State laws that mandate source separation and recycling or ban disposal of certain
materials in almost all municipalities were especially popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Many of these laws require all municipalities, counties, or cities to establish pick-up of separated
materials at curbside or other convenient locations.58 These kinds of programs are usually
implemented at the municipality or county level,59 but statewide recycling initiatives are also
possible. For example, Pennsylvania requires all municipalities with more than 5,000 people to
offer curbside recycling. In 2004, there were 974 curbside recycling programs in Pennsylvania,

53

Maryland only considered setting up a task force to study the possibility of a bottle deposit, so it was not included
in this statistic.
54
New York’s bill would also add water bottles to its list of bottles covered by the deposit.

http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/27/bottle-bill-bottled-up/?scp=1b&sq=bottle+deposit+new+york&st=nyt.
56
Only Tennessee and one West Virginia bill proposed 5 cent deposits.
57
New Jersey’s bill proposed a mixed retention plan, where the state retains 75 percent of the unredeemed deposits.
58
Kinnaman (2005, 2006) finds that about 18 to 22 states mandate curbside recycling. Because we did not have this
information for 2008, we group states with comprehensive statewide recycling provisions with those with mandatory
curbside recycling programs.
59
In 2007, more than 8,600 curbside recyclables collection programs were reported in the United States (EPA
2007). The EPA (2007) found that 84 percent, 76 percent, 61 percent, and 30 percent of the populations in the
Northeast, West, Midwest, and South, respectively, were served by curbside recycling. These percentages are
calculated based on the populations in states reporting data.

50

serving roughly 80% of the population.60 In addition to the curbside recycling requirement,
Pennsylvania requires all citizens to separate at least three materials from their other waste and to
store the materials until collection. Connecticut, the District of Columbia, New Jersey, New
York, West Virginia, and Wisconsin have passed similar “mandatory” recycling laws. Table B1
summarizes these laws and provides excerpts from key provisions of the laws.
Other states have required all municipalities to give residents an “opportunity to recycle.”
Minnesota, for example, requires all counties to make curbside pickup or collection centers for
recyclable materials available at sites that are convenient for residents to use. In 2004, there
were 730 curbside recycling programs in Minnesota, serving roughly 72% of the population.61
Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Nevada,62 Oregon, South Carolina, and Washington have passed
similar laws ensuring adequate recycling opportunities for their populations. These laws are
grouped with mandatory recycling laws in Table B1.
Many states have sought to encourage recycling at the local level by either requiring local
governments to consider recycling initiatives in their waste reduction plans or setting statewide
recycling goals. The local planning requirements frequently force counties or municipalities to
assess their current recycling programs and to consider more comprehensive programs in the
future. All of the states that have mandatory recycling or opportunity to recycle programs,
except Nevada, have planning requirements and most have a statewide recycling goal. The

60

The number of curbside recycling programs and the population with access to curbside collection (10,000,000)
was taken from Simmons et al. (2006). The percentage of the population with access to curbside collection was
calculated using Pennsylvania’s estimated population in 2004, prepared by the State Data Center of the
Pennsylvania State University (12,406,292), available at
http://www.dsf.health.state.pa.us/health/lib/health/Vital_Stat/2004/2004_statepop.pdf.
61
The number of curbside recycling programs and the population with access to curbside collection (3,750,000) is
from Simmons et al. (2006). The percentage of the population with access to curbside collection was calculated
using Minnesota’s estimated population in 2005, prepared by the U.S. Census Bureau (5,174,743), available at
http://www.census.gov/population/projections/SummaryTabA1.pdf.
62
Although only two counties meet Nevada's high county population cut-off of 100,000 or more for the
requirements (Clark County and Washoe County), this cut-off still covers about 88 percent of Nevada's population.

51

remaining states that have a planning requirement are summarized in Table B2, which provides
documentation of the applicable laws. Finally, the states that only have a statewide recycling
goal are summarized in Table B3, which also lists the specified recycling goal amount. It is not
clear whether such goals are followed by policies that are implemented in order to achieve these
goals.
