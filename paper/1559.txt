The Usefulness of the Wind—Up Measure
of Pension Liabilities:
A Labour Market Perspective

ABSTRACT

Financial economists have long favoured the use of a wind—up

measure of the firm's pension liabilities. Yet the pension liabilities
of the firm also represent the pension wealth of its workers. It is
reasonable to presume that workers and shareholders have a common view

of the pension contract. If the wind—up measure depicts the true
pension liabilities of the firm, then the wage concession granted by
its workers must reflect the fact that the firm may choose to terminate

the plan at any time. Data on the wage—service characteristics of
the membership of a sample of final earnings plans in Canada suggest,

contrary to the implications of the wind—up measure, that workers'
wages do not internalize accruing pension benefits on a year—to—year

basis. Instead, the data suggest that pension plans may be a vehicle
through which a significant portion of the total compensation of
individual employees is deferred until their later work years, and
that the wind—up measure may well understate the pension liabilities
of an on—going firm.

Introduction

The Financial Accounting Standards Board [4] or FASB recently proposed that net

pension assets or liabilities appear on the corporate balance sheet. In order to make
operational the concept of the augmented balance sheet, one must construct measures of

both pension assets and pension liabilities. The non—controversial view (at least among
economists!) is that pension assets be valued at market. The FASB endorses this view.
The measurement of pension liabilities, on the other hand, remains controversial. Financial economists such as Sharpe [10] have traditionally advocated a market or wind—up

measure of the firm's pension liabilities. The pensions due under the terms of the plan
if it were to be immediately terminated are calculated, and these pensions are then costed

at current annuity rates. The accrued benefit method without salary projection is the
actuarial valuation method used in the calculation. The wind—up measure is the market
value of the firm's pension liabilities since it identifies the precise amount that the
firm would require to discharge its legal obligation if the plan were terminated.1
Yet the FASB now rejects the use of this method of calculating the firm's pension

liabilities.2 Instead, the FASB proposes the use of the accrued benefit method with
salary projection to identify the pensions due under the terms of the plan. Because this
method uses the wage projected at the date of the worker's retirement rather than his
current wage, it generates a larger measure of the firm's pension liabilities. In effects
its use presumes that the pension liabilities of an on—going firm exceed those implied by
the wind—up measure.

In principle, one can bring evidence to bear on the empirical validity of these
(or other) measures of the firm's pension liabilities., Financial economists may wish to
explore the extent to which net pension liabilities, calculated in alternative ways, are

capitalized into share prices. If capital markets are efficient, one may be able to choose
between the competing measures on the basis of which set of results conforms most closely

to that predicted by economic theory. Unfortunately, this task is difficult. First, complications posed by tax considerations3 and the existence in the United States of the

2

Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) suggest that the dollar—for—dollar capitalization of net pension liabilities into share prices is not the predicted theoretical result

(Bulow, M$rck, Summers (3]). Secondly, it is undoubtedly difficult in practice to control
for profitability, risk, growth and other factors which influence share prices.

There is, however, an alternative way to approach this problem. To measure the
pension liabilities of the firm, under the reasonable assumption that workers and the
shareholders of the firm have a common interpretation of the pension contract, is also

to measure the pension wealth of its workers. If the wind—up measure accurately reflects
the firm's pension liabilities, the individual worker must view his pension wealth at each
point in time as a long—term bond whose market value is the present value of the nominal

pension payments legally due him under the formal terms of the plan. As first pointed out
by Bulow [1], the rational worker will forgo cash wages in each period exactly sufficient
to purchase the deferred annuity to which he becomes legally entitled during that period.
The worker will not forgo any greater amount of cash wages since he is aware of the fact
that the firm may choose to terminate the pension plan (or his employment) at any time.
If the worker is a member of a final earnings plan, then his pension benefit will

be proportional to his years of service and his final wage. Any wage increase that he
receives will raise the value of previously accrued pension benefits and thus his pension

wealth. A given wage increase will produce a magnified increase in the pension wealth of
an older, long—service employee. If the wind—up measure is correct, then such workers
cet. par. must receive smaller wage increases than their younger colleagues. If not, the
wind—up measure will understate the true pension liabilities of an on—going form. In
principle, wage increases could internalize this tendency for benefit accruals to rise
with years of service, even if they do not internalize discontinuities associated with

vesting and early retirement provisions. (Pesando [8] and others have argued that these
discontinuities are unlikely to be fully internalized into cash wages.)
The wind—up measure presumes, in effect, that the worker is tied to the firm for a

single period at a time. Yet it is important to emphasize that there is rich literature
in labour economics designed to explain why firms and their employees may choose to enter

3

into lifetime contracts. Lazear [6,7], for example, links both mandatory and early
retirement provisions to lifetime labour contracts in which old workers receive total
compensation that exceeds the value of their marginal product (and conversely for young

workers) in order to increase productivity and to discourage shirking. The rapid accrual
of pension benefits as a worker ages under the terms of a final earnings plan
effective way of accomplishing this restructuring of the payments stream.

be an

If the worker

is bound to the firm by a lifetime contract which requires the deferral of a substantial
portion of his total compensation, and if this is accomplished through the vehicle of a
pension plan, then the wind—up measure will understate the firm's pension liabilities.
This could occur, for example, if older long—service members of final earnings plans
were to receive wage increases that were not significantly different from those received
by younger plan members.4

This paper first performs a simulation experiment designed to identify how rapidly
wage increases should decline with years of service if members of final earnings plans

value their pension wealth on a wind—up basis. Longitudinal data on the wage—service
characteristics of members of a sample of 7 final earnings plans in Canada are then
analyzed in light of this experiment.

2. Wage Increases, by Service Cohort, Under the Wind—up Measure
The Analytical Framework
Consider the case of a worker who belongs to a final earnings plan which provides

a benefit, in the form ofa life annuity, equal to a specified fraction of his earnings
during his final year of employment for each year of service. For simplicity, assume that
benefits vest immediately (i.e. the worker immediately qualifies for the benefit due under
the terms of the plan) and that there are no early retirement provisions.

In return for

his promised pension benefit, the worker forgoes current wages. In the absence of an
implicit lifetime contract, competitive conditions dictate that the worker receive total
compensation equal to the value of his marginal product in every period.

If the worker

values his pension wealth on a wind—up basis, then he will forgo only that amount of

4

current wages necessary to "buy" the pension benefit that he legally accrues during the

period. The worker, like the shareholders of the firm, is cognizant of the fact that the
firm may terminate the plan at any time.

Let w be the current wage paid the worker during period t, let k be the fraction of the worker's final earnings which he receives for each year of service, let Vt be

the value of the worker's marginal product in period t, let A be the value of a unit
life annuity at his retirement age, let normal retirement under the plan occur when the

worker has completed T years of service, and let r be the nominal interest rate.
In the first period, the worker's total compensation is defined by:

— CT—1)
w1 + kAw1(l+r)

=

(1)

V1

The first term is his current wage, and the second is the value of the pension benefit

that he accrues in this initial period. In the next period, this becomes:

+ kAw2(l+r)_(T_2) + A(w2_w1)(l+r)(T2) = V2

(2)

The pension accrual now includes the enhancement, through the final earnings formula,

of the pension benefit earned in the previous period. In addition, the benefit accrued
is made more valuable by the fact that the worker is one year closer to retirement.
Because any wage increase enhances the value of a successively larger number of past service credits as the worker ages, wage increases are likely to fall sharply with the

worker's age, ceteris paribus. In the t—th year, the worker's total compensation is
broken down as follows:

w + kAw(l+r)

Solving

(T—t)

+ (t—l) kA(w_wi)(l+r)

(T t) =

(3) yields the following time path for the worker's wage:
=

(V

+ (t_l)wt_l(l+r) (Tt))/(1 + tA(l+r)(Tt))

(4)

The wind—up measure of the firm's pension liability (Lt) at time t, which is
also the wind—up measure of the worker's pension wealth, is:
Lt =

twt(l+r)(Tt)

(5)

Because the worker must receive total compensation that exactly equals the value of his

5

marginal product in all future periods, L measures the present value of the excess
of future payments promised to the worker over the future value of his labour services.

If the firm were to terminate the plan at any time t, L would be the payment required
by the firm to discharge its legal pension obligation to the worker. Note also that L
is nothing more than the accumulated value (at interest rate r) of the wages previously
forgone by the worker in return for the pension benefit to which he is legally entitled
at that point in time.

The Simulation Exercises

Assume that a male worker begins work at age 30 and retires at age 65 (T35) and
then draws the life annuity due him under the terms of the plan. To add realism, assume
that the final earnings formula provides the worker with a nominal pension benefit equal

to 2% of his average earnings during the last 5 years for each year of service. The
worker thus retires with a total pension benefit equal to 70% of his final average

earnings. Because most large employers have granted ad hoc cost—of—living adjustments
to retired workers, and because one of the plans in the sample provides for fully
indexed life annuities, it is also useful to examine the case in which the annuities

due under the terms of the plan are real. Following Pesando [9], the risk—free real
interest rate used to value these annuities is set equal to one percent.

The simulated rates of growth of real wages are presented in Table 1 under the

"No Early Retirement Column". The simulations assume an inflation rate (9%), nominal
interest rate (12%) and a rate of growth of the worker's marginal product (11%) that

correspond roughly to market conditions in l980, The decline in the rate of growth
of real wages is more apparent when cumulative wage increases are examined. Between
service years 10 and 15, real wages rise by 8.16% (6.72%) when the pension is nominal

(real). Between service years 30 and 35, real wages decline by 3.66% (10.1%) when the
pension benefit is nominal (real).

These results are readily extended to the case in which the real value of a worker's

marginal product declines in his later years. If this is so, as suggested by some authors,6

6

then the wage increases identified in Table 1 will exceed those due long—service

employees. Any evidence that wage increases do not decline with the employee's years
of service would then constitute stronger evidence against the hypothesis that workers
value their pension wealth on a wind—up basis.

Typically, a plan member becomes eligible for an early retirement pension after

he has reached age 55 and met a minimum service requirement. Early retirement provisions
result in a different time path for benefit accruals, and thus for wages if they internal-

ize fully the value of benefit accruals on a period—by—period basis. To focus attention
on this issue, assume that the employee becomes eligible at age 55, after completing

25 years of service, for an early retirement pension. The early retirement pension
equals the accrued pension that the worker would otherwise receive at the normal retirement age of 65, less 3% for each year by which his actual retirement age precedes age 65.
(If the worker retires at age 55, he receives 70% of the pension that would otherwise

commence at age 65; at age 56, 73%, and so on.) The rates of growth of real wages
conditional7 upon the worker's qualifying for the early retirement benefit are also
presented in Table 1.

The differences in benefit accruals, and thus in the wages that internalize them,

are fairly dramatic. Absent early retirement, the rate of growth of real wages declines
steadily with years of service and becomes negative when the employee has 30 (24) years

of service when the benefit is nominal (real). Conditional upon the employee becoming
entitled to an early retirement benefit at age 55, the rate of growth of real wages

declines more rapidly. The growth rate first becomes negative when the employee completes
23 (16) years of service when the benefit is nominal (real). Further, the growth rate
rises sharply in the employee's 56th year. Having qualified for the early retirement
benefit at age 55, the benefit that the worker accrues during his 56th year is much
smaller, and the growth rate of his real wages rises commensurately.

In years 57 through

65, the growth rate is positive and fluctuates on a yearly basis to reflect the averaging
in the earnings base.

3. Longitudinal Data on Wage and Service Characteristics of the Membership of a
Sample of Final Earnings Plans
The Sample

GBB Associates Ltd. has provided data on the wage and service characteristics of

plan members for a sample of 7 final earnings plans in Canada. All plans have early
retirement provisions. Only one plan provides for the contractual indexing of pension
benefits, while one other has a stated policy of providing ad hoc cost—of—living adjustments.

The simulation exercises presume that the worker enters the plan at age 30 and

remains at the firm until he reaches normal retirement age. In effect, the worker's
age and years of service are assumed to be perfectly correlated. Inspection of the
cross-tabulations by age and years of service indicates that the vast majority of male

workers joined their plans between the ages of 25 and 30. In interpreting the empirical

results, it is thus useful to view the representative male worker with s years of

service as having attained age s + 28. Because of their relatively small number and
less homogenous age and service characteristics, females are excluded from the empirical
analysis.

Wage Increases by Service Cohorts
The simulations in Tables 1 indicate that wage increases that internalize benefit
accruals on a year—to—year basis decline monotonically, although not strictly linearly,
with a worker's years of service until either his retirement age or the date of his

eligibility for an early retirement benefit. To provide evidence on these predictions,
regressions of the annual wage increases granted each service cohort on its years of

service are presented in Table 2. Because the number of years for which annual wage
increases could be calculated varies across plans, so does the number of regressions.
Regressions are also presented for the cumulative wage increases received by each

service cohort over the full period for which data are available. Finally, because the
"raw' data are also of interest, summary data on wage increases by 5—year service
cohorts are presented in Table 3.

8

Regressions are run for cohorts with from 11 to 35, and with from 11 to 26, years

of service. Because most plans have a vesting requirement of 10 years service, it
seems appropriate to exclude those cohorts with 10 or less years of service. Because
the maximum number of years of pensionable service is typically 35, it also seems appro-

priate to exclude those cohorts with 36 or more years of service. The truncated sample
is motivated by the desire to focus on wage increases prior to the employee's qualifying

for an early retirement benefit, typically at age 55. If the representative worker joins
the plan at age 28, he will have 26 years of service at age 54. For plan number five,
the corresponding regression is run for cohorts with from 11 to 24 years of service,
since the eligibility requirement 'for the early retirement benefit is age 50 and 25 years

service. No employee with 24 years of service has yet qualified for the early retirement
benefit.

For only 2 of the 7 plans (numbers one and five) is there any evidence of a
significant negative relationship between the wage increases granted a cohort and its

years of service. For plan number five, in which this evidence is strongest, the actual
benefit accruals and thus the total compensation of each service cohort were calculated.
These results, available from the author upon request, indicate that the negative
relationship between wage increases and years of service was not sufficient to prevent

the total compensation granted each cohort from rising with its years of service. For
the other plans, there is no evidence that the wage increases granted male employees
decline significantly with their years of service, with or without consideration of
early retirement provisions.

4. Wage Increases, by Service Cohort, under the Accrued Benefit Method
with Salary Projections
Since the FASB [4] recommends the use of the accrued benefit method with
salary projection, it is instructive to consider the rates of growth of wages by
service cohort that one would expect to observe if this method provides the correct

measure of the firm's pension liability. For this to be the case, the liability so
identified must equal the present value of the excess of future payments promised

9

to the worker over the future value of his labor services. Of particular interest
is the question of whether the rate of growth of wages should decline with the
worker's years of service, as implied by the wind—up measure.

Under the accrued benefit method with salary projection, the pension liability
is again calculated on the basis of the worker's years of service to date, but his
projected wage at the date of his termination or retirement now enters the calculation.

The labor market "story" is as follows. The worker receives total compensation equal
to the value of his marginal product in each and every period. However, he (and the
shareholders of the firm) value his accruing pension benefit on the basis of his

projected wage at retirement rather than his current wage. The worker forgoes cash
wages in excess of those required to purchase the pension benefit to which he would
be legally entitled if the plan were terminated or if he were to quit the firm.
In effect, the worker has agreed to defer the receipt of a portion of his total

compensation beyond that which he would recover if he were to leave the firm. In
this sense, the worker is tied to the firm, perhaps for the incentive reasons sketched
by Lazear [6, 71.

As previously noted, the worker's pension wealth (and thus the firm's pension
liability) is equal to the accumulated value of the cash wages previously forgone

by the worker in return for his pension benefits. If the worker forgoes greater cash

wages, the firm's pension liability is greater. This is the labor market perspective
on why the firm's pension liability is greater under the accrued benefit method with
salary projection, if it indeed depicts the true pension liability of the firm.
To determine the time path of the worker's wage, note that the pension

benefit accrued in the final period (T) becomes payable immediately, so that the
worker's total compensation in this period is:

WT

+

kAwT = VT

In all earlier periods, the worker's total compensation is:

(6)

10

=

w + we

Vt

The time path of wages (wv) follows immediately from (7). If the value of the
worker's marginal product grows continuously at the rate g and has an initial

value V0, then:
—r(T--t)

gt —

dw/dt

w

—-

gV0e

rkAwTe

(8)

— kAwTe

From (8), it follows that the rate of growth of wages may exceed, equal or fall

short of the rate of growth of the worker's marginal product. If rg, however,

then (dw/dt)/w = g.

In short, there need be no tendency for the rate of growth

of wages to decline with a worker's years of service if the accrued benefit method
with salary projection provides the correct measure of the firm's pension liability.
If the interest rate and the rate of growth of the worker's marginal product are (or
are approximately) equal, then the rate of growth of the worker's cash wage will
be independent of his years of service if (as previously assumed) the rate of growth
of his marginal product is similarly independent of his years of service.

5. Conclusions
If workers value their pension wealth on a wind—up basis, then wage increases
granted to members of final earnings plans must decline with their years of service,

but only until the date at which they qualify for early retirement benefits. Quantitatively, this effect should be visible in raw data on the wage increases granted
alternative service cohorts, especially if the wage increases are averaged over several
years (for example, the average wage increase over the past 5 years to the cohort which
now has 25 years of service, relative to the cohort which now has 20 years of service).
This paper invokes the assumption that the (non—observable) value of a worker's

marginal product grows at a rate independent of his years of service. For only 2 of
the 7 plans examined is there any evidence that wage increases granted a service

cohort decline with its years of service.8 These results are best viewed as exploratory

11

since (1) the sample is quite small and (2) it was not possible to compare the wage
increases granted these members of final earnings plans to those granted workers with
comparable years of service in paired firms which provide either no pension plans or

substantially "inferior" ones. Nonetheless, the suggestion is that a final earnings
plan may be a vehicle for deferring a portion of an employee's lifetime compensation
to his later work years, and that the wind—up measure may well understate the pension

liabilities of an on—going firm.9 By implication, the accrued benefit method with
salary projection (or perhaps a projected benefit method10) may provide a better
measure of these pension liabilities.

FOOTNOTES

1. This statement presumes that there are sufficient assets in the pension plan to discharge fully the pension liabilities, and

abstracts from the existence of plan pro-

visions which may require that as yet unvested benefits

become vested in the event of

a voluntary plan wind—up.
2.

In Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 35, "Accounting and Reporting
by Defined Benefit Plans", issued in March 1980, the Financial Accounting Standards

Board (FASB) required that plan liabilities be reported

using the accrued benefit

method without salary projection.

3. Note that a firm which has a surplus of $1 in its pension plan would, if the plan
were liquidated immediately, add $1

* (l—T) to its retained earnings where T is

the tax rate faced by the firm. If the firm can keep the plan overfunded by $1
forever, the value of the firm will rise by $1, as shown by Bulow, Mrck, Summers

[3]. Analogous arguments pertain to the case in which the plan has an unfunded
liability of $1.

4. If a substantial portion of the total compensation

of workers is deferred to their

later years, then firms may have implicit liabilities quite independent of their

pension arrangements. This important point is explored, but not resolved, by
Bulow, M$rck and Summers [3] in their recent study of the market's valuation of
unfunded pension liabilities.

5. The data examined later in the study pertain to 1980 or thereabouts. To calculate
benefit accruals, nominal wages must be identified,, and hence the rate of inflation

is an important input as well.

6. Wise and Kotlikoff [11], in order to illustrate pension accruals by age for a
stylized pension plan, postulate a time path

for real wages that exhibits very

little growth after the worker reaches age 55.

Wise—Kotlikoff do so on the basis

of longitudinal data contained in the Retirement History Survey and the Current
Population Survey.

13

7. If the worker is to receive wages plus accruing pension benefits which equal the
value of his marginal product in every period, and assuming that the worker does
not qualify for the early retirement benefit if his employment is terminated prior
to age 55 (as appears to be the usual case), the worker must "pay" for the early
retirement benefit in the form of a dramatic wage reduction at the date that he

first qualifies for it. It is straightforward to show that if the worker's pension
benefit is nominal, the worker's real wage in his 55th year must fall to 17.5% of

its value in the 54th year. If the benefit is real, the worker's cash wage in
his 55th year must be negative!

The rather strong message is that worker's do not value their pension wealth

exclusively on a wind—up basis. It remains possible, however, that wages do
internalize the tendency for benefit accruals to rise sharply with the worker's
years of service, perhaps conditional upon the worker's qualifying for the early

retirement benefit. The latter is the possibility that is examined in the text.
8. Ippolito [5] performs a similar investigation with U.S. data and arrives at the
same conclusion.

9. A caveat to this conclusion is the possibility that the tradeoff between wages
and pension benefits takes place at the level of the employee group as a whole, as

noted by Bulow—Landsman [2]. If older members of the employer group receive wage
increases that produce benefit accruals that are quite large, this may be offset

by concessions made by other members of the employee group. This type of
behaviour is, one might conjecture, more likely to characterize the total compensation

packages negotiated formally in the union sector. Yet it is in the non—union sector
that earnings—based pension plans, are concentrated.

10. Under a projected benefit method, the worker's future service and wage rate are
both projected to determine the total pension benefit that will be due him on the

date of his retirement. Normal pension contributions are then established,

14

typically as a 1vel percentage of the worker's wage, to discharge the projected
benefit over his active work life. The pension liability under this method is the
present value of the total pension benefit projected for the worker at the date
of his retirement, less the present value of future normal contributions to the
plan. Because contributions are "large'1 relative to accruing benefits when the
worker is young and "small" when he is old, the pension liability under the projected
benefit method will exceed that calculated under either of the accrued benefit
methods.

Notes:

a The value of worker's marginal product grows in nominal terms at 11 percent per year.
The (purely nominal) pension benefit is 2 percent of the worker's average earnings
for the prior 5 years for each year of service. Worker enters plan at age 30, retires
at age 65 and then draws the life annuity earned under the terms of the plan.
b At age 55 (after completing 25 years of service), the worker becomes eligible for an
early retirement pension. If he elects to retire at age 55, he receives immediately
a life annuity equal to 70 percent of the benefit due him at age 65; at age 56, 73
percent; and so forth. The calculated wage paths are conditional upon the worker's
becoming eligible for early retirement at age 55.
c The present value of an indexed life annuity, on its commencement date, is calculated
at an interest rate of one percent.

equation is: t(s)=aO+a1s+ut where t(s) is the wage increase in year t

service cohort with years of service s. Bracketed figures are t—statistics.
Single (double) asterisks denote significance at the 5% (1%) level.
b

In many plans, 10 years service is the minimum vesting requirement. The maximum
number of years of pensionable service is typically 35. Because many employees
commence their employment at or around the age of 28, truncating the sample at
26 years of service is an attempt to focus on wage increases prior to the employee's
attaining age 55 and thus qualifying for an early retirement benefit. In plan no.
5, an employee qualifies for an early retirement benefit if he has reached age 50
and conipleted 25 years of service. The sample is thus truncated after 24 years of

service.
C

Annualized wage increase, 1980—1982.
