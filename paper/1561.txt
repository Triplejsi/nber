Productivity Measurement with
Nonstatic Expectations and Varying
Capacity Utilization:
An Integrated Approach

ABS TRACT

Typically measures of multifactor productivity growth have been
based on a production and optimization framework that assumes all
inputs are instantaneously adjustable, thus ignoring the important

impacts of short run fixity of certain inputs. This paper focuses
on the distinction between short and long run production behavior
represented by economic capacity utilization indexes, and on the
adjustment of observed productivity measures for the effects of

short run fixity characterized by these indexes. A dynamic optimization
model based on adjustment costs for quasi—fixed inputs is developed
to calculate capacity utilization adjustments for productivity growth

measures. The resulting framework is then used to identify
empirically the effects of capacity utilization, nonstatic expectations,
nonconstant returns to scale and adjustment costs for both capital
and labor on productivity growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector,
1947—1979.

I. INTRODUCTION
Measures of multifactor productivity growth have long been linked
to outward shifts in production isoquants or downward shifts in

average cost curves. Typically, such links have been built on a
production and optimization framework that assumes all inputs are
instantaneously adjustable, and thus assumes also that there is no

distinction between short and long run. This distinction can be very
important, however, particularly when large shocks occur, for in such
cases the characteristics of the firm's short run behavior during the

initial part of the adjustment response may differ substantially from

those occurring once long run equilibrium has been attained. This
paper focuses attention on the implications for multifactor productivity
measurement of increasing marginal adjustment costs for quasi—fixed

inputs, and thus on the need to distinguish short- from long-run impacts.

Most of the models currently used for productivity analysis are
based on the assumptions of full utilization or long run equilibrium

and static expectations at all points in time for all inputs. More
specifically, these models are typically based on the assumption that
firms always use both technically and economically efficient input

combinations. Thus productivity growth may be represented by

,nY/3t Y =

f(x),

9nC/t -

Eft

(where Y is output, defined by the production function

and t represents the state of technology), or by

(where

C is total costs). Ohta (1975) has developed

These representations of productivity, however, permit no distinction

between short and long run since they are essentially based on a
static or timeless model where all inputs are assumed instantaneously
variable.

This problem was recognized in early studies of technical change
such as that by Jorgenson and Griliches (1967), who attempted to adjust

productivity measures for cyclical adjustment using capacity utilization
(CU) indices. Such cyclical adjustments, however, have ambiguous interpretation and have been a source of dispute since they are not based on
a theoretical foundation within which the short run-long run nature of
productivity growth is isolated.

More recently, Berndt and Fuss (1981) and Baily (1981) have
attempted to capture the effect of "disequilibrium" using the deviation

of market- and implicit-valuation of the fixed capital stock faced by

the firm. These studies are of crucial importance for focussing
attention on the impacts of input stocks. Ambiguities still remain,
however, concerning the roles of dynamic optimization and anticipatory
expectations.

In order to facilitate interpretation of utilization decisions and

resulting implications for productivity growth, an integrating framework
is required to capture variations in utilization, anticipatory behavior
and costs of adjustment, as well as the effects of nonconstant returns

to scale. Such a framework, a dynamic optimization model of an
imperfectly competitive firm producing at a point of long run nonconstant

returns to scale with increasing marginal adjustment costs on quasifixed inputs and nonstatic expectations, has been constructed by

—4—

Morrison (1983b,1984). The model is based on costs of adjustment for
quasi-fixed inputs that induce slow adjustment by firms to "optimal"
or "desired" levels of the quasi—fixed inputs consistent with nonstatic

expectations on prices and output. The model is structured so one can
derive explicitly a system of short run demand equations for variable
inputs and accumulation equation(s) for quasi-fixed input(s) based
on an endogenous "flexible accelerator" or partial adjustment process,

as n Berndt, Fuss and Waverman (1979). Thus by characterizing the
corresponding cost curves one can determine the firm's optimal

adjustment path from the short to long run in response to a temporary
disequilibrium situation.

In this paper I show how various impacts on observed productivity

can be identified and measured within such a framework. The plan of

the paper is as follows. In Section II I first demonstrate that (i)
multifactor productivity measures are affected systematically by
divergence between long run equilibrium and short run (temporary)
equilibrium, hereafter denoted subequilibrium,

(ii) a properly

defined index of capacity utilization (CU) can be used to quantify this

divergence, and (iii) the existence of nonstatic expectations,
adjustment costs, and nonconstant returns to scale affects the time
path of investment and thus the time pattern of measured productivity

growth through impacts on CU. In Section III I develop and report on
an empirically implementable econometric model that permits separate
identification of the effects of CU, nonstatic expectations, adjustment
costs and nonconstant returns to scale on productivity in the U.S.

manufacturing sector, 1947-1979. A primary finding is that both

—5—

subequilibriuin and anticipatory behavior have substantial impacts on

observed productivity measures. In addition, there is a notable
difference between two alternative models used, which suggests that
disaggregation of labor into production and nonproduction workers and
recognition of the quasi—fixity of nonproduction workers are crucial

for developing valid measures of productivity trends. Finally, in
Section IV I focus on how this research integrates much of the
previous literature on factor demands and productivity growth, and thus
provides a framework within which to reconcile alternative approaches.

II. PRODUCTIVITY AND ITS COMPONENTS: A THEORETICAL ANALYSIS
Productivity growth is defined as the diminution in total costs
from an increase in the state of technology (t) not explained by

substitution between inputs-—the residual €.

In

order empirically

to identify the impacts on total productivity mentioned in the
Introduction, a framework must be constructed in which deviations of

capacity utilization (Cu) from unity, nonstatic expectations, adjustment
costs, and nonconstarit returns to scale (NCRTS) are incorporated.

This requires recognizing the constraints on the firm which result in

subequilibrium utilization of the quasi-fixed inputs. Thus the analysis
is structured around a cost function divided explicitly into variable
and fixed cost components. The output or price choice for a firm
facing a demand curve with finite elasticity is assumed to be a

sequential decision, taken into account in the estimating model. I
begin by using this general framework to identify the current
subequilibrium--CU--and technical progress components of observed

productivity growth. Additional extensions are considered in turn.
Assume the restricted or variable cost function can be represented

by G(x.,*.,w.,t,Y) where x. is a vector of J quasi-fixed input
quantities, k.

As outlined in Lau (1978) and Berndt, Fuss and Waverman (1979), G

represents minimum variable costs given x., w. and Y, and under
appropriate regularity conditions has standard properties including:

This expression represents the marginal cost savings involved if one

dynamic framework.

This is a long run cost elasticity analogous to typical long run price

by the proportion A in each period. This decomposition captures the
flavor of the difference between short and long run producivity impacts,

but is not very useful for interpretation or linkages with the notion of

This definition of shadow costs is slightly different than the "gross"

from a static optimization framework where the contribution of investment

to costs is not explicitly defined. With dynamic optimization, shadow
costs are "net" of adjustment costs because the costs of putting the

valuation of the quasi—fixed inputs exceeds or falls short of the

Thus the output CU measure is exactly dual to the

In summary, in this integrated approach the observed productivity
is distorted from a true technical progress measure by

change

fixed inputs and resulting deviations in CU from unity. It is possible,
as the

however, to inpute the true technical progress impact

The cost-CU measure and its use as a link between short and long run
productivity measures can be interpreted in various ways.7 One interpretation of this CU measure is as a form of a "multi—input Tobin's q"

measure. Specifically, 6Cj depends crucially on the deviation between
Z, and p, which is the basis for the calculation of marginal Tobin's

q as Zk/pkl where k represents capital, and where only the stock
effects or gross shadow value of capital is considered. Therefore in the
case of one quasi-fixed input, adjustment by Tobin's q as suggested by
Berridt and Fuss is equivalent to multiplication by CU. When there are
multiple quasi-fixed inputs, while the weighting of different quasi-fixed
inputs for Tobin's q is anthiguous, the CU adjustment is clearly
appropriate.

Another interpretation of the cost CU measure is as a ratio of short
and long run returns to scale, where short run returns to scale are defined
over variable factors given fixed capital =

—

view of CU is consistent with Ohta; in order to isolate technical

—14—

change one must adjust by returns to scale, which in this case involves
short run returns.

A final interpretation of the cost CU measure refers more to

conventional methods of productivity measurement. Multiplication of the

conventional measure by C/C* in effect revalues the shares of each of
the inputs and, therefore, the weight on the change in that input to
reflect the utilization of the given capital stock instead of the

measured share. This multiplication incorporates the true economic
valuation of the capital stock--its shadow marginal productivity in
conjunction with the other inputs--instead of its simple market
transaction value.

The CU adjustment therefore is important and is consistent with

alternative interpretations. Observed productivity changes must also,
however, be recognized to depend on the existence of nonstatic

expectations, adjustment costs and NCRTS. I now consider these additions
to the basic structure.

The conceptual importance of the extension to nonstatic expectations
is that some current behavior of the firm may not correctly be imputed
to responses in terms of current exogenous variables, but may result from

anticipation of future economic conditions. Since the firm cannot
respond instantaneously at a future point in time, it is rational for it

to adjust partially before the exogenous change. Assuming that the
observed productivity residual is a result only of rational optimizing
firm behavior in terms of current variables may therefore omit important
information that can further clarify the productivity residual.
Introduction of nonstatic expectations introduces several

—15—

complications. For example, with nonstatic expectations the economic
agent is not striving toward "desired" levels of quasi-fixed input stocks

x*(t) defined simply in terms of current variables, but instead can be

envisaged as moving toward the sum of x*(t) and a discounted weighted
average of the future desired stocks of x defined in terms of the

anticipated paths of exogenous variables, x :8

x)

In a model including nonstatic expectations the effect of J 0 on
the CU measure can be captured by imputing the current x that would

allow a geometric progression to x instead of to x, and then
determining the levels of variable inputs necessary to produce actual

output and these imputed investment levels, instead of those including all

anticipatory behavior. Two alternative CU measures can then be

(i) a current value measure CU, and (ii) an imputed

calculated,

present value measure CU .
pv

The difference between these can be

attributed to anticipatory behavior.
CU

is based on measurement within the full nonstatic expectations

cv

model and includes both subequilibrium and nonstatic expectations effects.

Calcualtion of CU

and

requires purging from

for all

the effects of investment due purely to anticipatory behavior, rather

than that attributed to current exogenous variables. This results in

the adjusted CU measure (1 -

Adjustment of a conventional productivity growth measure by dividing

by (1 -

-

Ec.)

has been interpreted as revaluing input shares to

reflect the full utilization of the quasi-fixed inputs including all

—16—

observed variable input use. By contrast, adjustment by

' incorporates

-

-

the idea that variable inputs used for

anticipatory investment should not be evaluated as if they were
contributing to current productivity.

Note that this procedure for purging the effects of anticipatory
behavior, although it attributes all current variable input demand to
decisions based on current variables, does not categorize all variable

input demands as those corresponding to current output production. To
sharpen measures of technical change it is however necessary to purge
costs of adjustment corresponding to all investment, not just antici—

patory investment, from the productivity calculation. To accomplish
this,

-

(1 -

or

CUt can be derived as a subequilibriuxn

indicator net of all investment costs that distort measurement of cost

diminution. By construction this measure purges the shares of variable
inputs of all input use that is not directly productive in terms of
augmenting current output levels.

The final adjustment of productivity measures requires incorporation

of NCRTS. The importance of this extension in the preceding analysis
based on CRTS is first evident in equation (3); the substitution of

With nonconstant returns to scale, the shares are thus adjusted to
reflect the fact that some increases in tiefficiencyul or decreases in

cost are simply due to scale effects. The NCRTS adjustment alters the
cost shares to represent output shares- —purging the share of the scale

effect that decreases costs with no true increase in input efficiency.

III. EMPIRICAL ILLUSTRATION
I now turn to an empirical implementation of the decomposition of the

path of productivity growth over time. Specifically, I attempt to assess
empirically the role of subequilibrium, adjustment costs, nonstatic
expectations, and NCRTS in determining the 1949-1979 path of productivity

growth in U.S. manufacturing.10 I proceed first to summarize the
measures used to decompose observed productivity growth and to isolate
technical progress.

The measure of productivity used as a reference point is

This is the conventional measure of cost-side total factor productivity
calculated from the data on actual cost shares and changes in cost and

input prices as the (negative) difference between ê/C and the share-

weighted sum of input prices ./w. and j./p. .

It is also a

justifiable measure of productivity growth given long run equilibrium,

instantaneous adjustment, static expectations, and CRTS. The decom-

position of 6Ct is carried out by generalizing each of these
restrictions. For expositional purposes, to represent C

I rely on

the conventional index of the state of technology or level of

productivity denoted At where

=

A/A.

Some of the observed productivity residual

may

arise

simply

from short run "rigidities" rather than from technical progress. A
more appropriate measure to isolate the impact of subequilibrium has

been shown to be

C/CU;

the corresponding produc-

tivity index is denoted At. This is the first adjustment to be
analyzed below.

In addition, observed changes in productivity may arise from

nonstatic expectations. To adjust for nonstatic expectations it is

sufficient simply to measure E

technology A .

CU

is a temporary equilibrium indicator based on

current instead of intertemporal optimization. This is the second
adjustment to be discussed.

Since some observed productivity may also result from fluctuations
in variable input use for investment, the corresponding adjustment costs
should be purged in order to derive a sharper measure of technical
I I I

progress. This is accomplished by calculating

Cct/net

,

and

cumulating these growth rates to derive the index of productivity

levels, A''. This is the third adjustment to be assessed.
This third measure, however, reflects true technical progress only

if the technology exhibits CRTS. Otherwise, the apparent productivity
changes resulting from scale effects are incorrectly attributed to

technical progress. To adjust for this it is necessary to multiply by
returns to scale, or in the notation above, to calculate

This final expression for

is the technical progress residual

after adjusting for the full set of structural and behavioral factors

considered above. It may therefore be used to determine whether, during
periods of volatility, changes in the economic situation usually
attributed simply to "productivity" are instead attributable to other
direct and indirect impacts.

The model I use to construct and estimate these measures is from

Morrison (1983b). Briefly, this model assumes capital is quasi—fixed
and that costs of adjustment occur for net capital formation. An

—21—

alternative specification compared here also includes nonproduction
workers (N) as a quasi—fixed factor; labor is "hoarded" in the sense
that there are costs of adjustment on net investment in the "stock" of

nonproduction workers. The firm is assumed to produce output using
capital and three variable inputs, labor (L) (or production workers (P)
for the alternative specification), energy (E), and nonenergy inter-

mediate materials (M). The firm's optimization process involves

maximizing at each time t the present value of the future stream of
profits given expected paths of the exogenous variables——output demand

and input prices-—and adjustment cost relations. This is accomplished
sequentially (as in Morrison (1983a)) by minimizing variable costs for

any output and quasi-fixed input levels, setting output price according
to a short run condition of equality between marginal revenues and costs
to determine the output level, and finally by choosing an optimal

investment plan, conditional on the quasi-fixed input stocks at time t.
The firm's decisions are represented, given an explicit form for the

variable cost function G, by a system of demand equations for its
variable inputs, an output price equation, and investment equations
analogous to (13) for the quasi—fixed inputs incorporating nonstatic

expectations. Parameter estimation by maximum likelihood procedures
results in a full specification of short and long run elasticities.

C

Specifically, the model permits calculation of CU, E1
11

and ECy•
In the first column of Table 1A, I report the conventionally

measured index of the state of technology At. Productivity indices
calculated from the adjusted productivity growth estimates are presented

—22—

in the next four columns for the one quasi-fixed input model as
A,', A1'' ,

and

.

Analogous productivity measures for the

alternative two quasi-fixed input model, recognizing the short run

fixity of both K and N, are presented in Table 13.
Although these conventional year—by—year measures provide some
indication of the post-1973 productivity slowdown, the impacts of the
adjustments are not immediately evident. I therefore suxnmarize the

information contained in Tables 1A and lB using average annual productivity growth rates over selected time periods; these are presented in

Table 2. This temporal breakdown is based on the common divisions into
time periods of pre—1965, 1965 to 1973, and post—1973.

The first point to note from Table 2 is that the measures calculated

at the two levels of labor aggregation differ slightly. Over the entire
time period 1949-1979, the traditionally measured average annual multi-

factor productivity increase measured using four inputs, K, L, E, and

M, was .83% per year, whereas once L is disaggregated into N and P
productivity growth over this period appears one tenth larger--. 90%/year.

The post-1965 slowdown also appears more noticeable when both nonproduction and production workers are considered separately than when they

are aggregated. This difference is largest precisely when the greatest
compositional changes occurred within L; such changes are obscured by
aggregation.

Overall, from either model, a substantial amount of productivity

decline is evident since 1949—1965. A great deal of the productivity
growth change, however, appears to have taken place before 1973, as was

also noted by Norsworthy et al. (1979). In particular, although from

1949-1965 the average annual growth rate (AAGR) was 1.1% to 1.3%,

between 1965 and 1973 it dropped to .65% to .70%. From Tables 1A and 1B,
this appears to be a result of two significant declines in productivity,

one in 1966-1967 and another in 1970. Thus the AAGR over the sub-

period from 1965-1970 was negative—-approximately -.1% to —.2%. This
period could be a strong contender for the title of "productivity
growth slowdown."

Compared to the 1965-1973 period, post 1973 the AAGR dropped
further, to approximately .41 to .44%--only about 35% of the productivity

growth rate observed in 1949—1965. This reflects, of course, the

celebrated recent "productivity growth slowdown." This productivity growth
slowdown is, however, driven by the productivity decreases of only a

couple of years. If, for example, a researcher in 1977 were considering
the productivity decline from 1973 it would appear much more imposing;
the 1973-1976 period exhibited a slight productivity decrease of

approximately -.01% per year. From 1976 on the AAGR in productivity
began to attenuate this evidence of stagnation; total factor productivity
between 1976 and 1979 again began to grow at about .7% to .9% per year,
close to that occurring between 1949 and 1965.

Hence there appear to be two periods when large downward shifts in
productivity growth occurred, namely, the late 1960's and the few years

subsequent to 1973. Together these result in a rather substantial overall
effect on 1965-1979 productivity growth as compared to the previous
fifteen years, but they do not present conclusive evidence of a unique
sudden slacking off of productivity growth post-1973 in U.S. manufacturing.

These trends in observed productivity growth are attenuted somewhat

—27—

by the impact of the adjustments outlined above. The first adjustment to
the productivity measure is that for subequilibriuxn. The empirical
in

significance of this adjusted productivity measure, reported as

Table 1 and in terms of AAGR as C'

ct

in

Table 2, differs across models.

With the adjustment, in the one quasi-fixed input model the residual

decreases in all sub-periods, but by the largest proportion inthe
earlier years; part of the relatively large growth in productivity
observed in earlier periods appears to have been due to the effects

of subequilibrium. For the two quasi-fixed input model productivity
growth appears larger for both later time periods for

than for

Ati particularly for the 1973—1979 time period. This constitutes evidence
on the role of labor hoarding as well as fixity of capital in accounting for
subequilibrium effects.

The above results reveal a modest decrease in the dispersion of
productivity measures over time with the subequilibriuxn adjustment. In
addition, the late l960s still appears as a period of poor productivity
performance and the two years after 1973 seem ever more catastrophic as
a result of large unexpected shocks, particularly for the two quasifixed input model.

The second adaptation of the productivity growth measure to

is more dramatic. The adjustment for nonstatic expectations in the one
quasi-fixed input model results in a larger productivity residual for all
time periods--even larger than the unadjusted

measure for the two

later time periods. This suggests a tendency for anticipatory investment
to have a depressing effect on traditional productivity growth measures.
This same tendency is evident for the two quasi-fixed input model.

The distincition between subequilibrium adjustment to

further nonstatic expectations adjustment to C'

is

and the

that the former

—28—

reveals the impact of unexpected subequilibrium which is not properly
accoxnmodated-—subequilibrium occurs in terms of present as well as

current valued variables--whereas the latter documents the effect of

anticipated changes. This implies that although when the firm is
optimistic productivity measures adjusted for nonstatic expectations
likely improve, at times when the firm's expectations are incorrect

may fall. To illustrate the implications of this, reconsider the

indices in Tables 1A and lB. Although C' between 1973 and 1976
appears uniformly better than

,

events in 1974 still had very

depressing effects as firms attempted to adjust to a subequilibrium
resulting from unanticipated shocks in 1973.

The revision to account for total adjustment costs of C'' to
ct

C''

simply

augments, as expected, the trends found for the expectations

adjustment. Specifically, when net investment corresponding to current
exogenous variables is also purged, so that input use only for produced
output and not investment is attributed to the productivity measure,

productivity appears more robust over the entire period. In total, over
the 1949-1979 period the combined effect of these revisions to

in

the two quasi-fixed input model indicates that productivity growth was
approximately .94% per annum in contrast to the .90% corresponding to

contemporaneous observations. This tendency is even more pronounced
for the final sub-period. The unadjusted measure indicates .28% AAGR
over the 1973-1979 period, whereas with the three adaptations the AAGR

becomes .335%, about a 20% increase. Results for the one quasi-fixed
input model are similar.

Additional information about the first three adjustments may be

—29—

obtained by considering the alternative CU indicators directly. These

indices are presented in Table 3 as CU , CU , and
cv
pv

CU

net

respec-

tively for the two models. The most obvious difference among the

and CU

indices is that the CU

cv

net

unity less often than the CU
pv

indicators reach values above

measure. As discussed further in

Morrison (1984), this is a priori appealing; CU indicators including
nonstatic expectations tend to fall short of unity any time the firm
is investing additionally in anticipation of, for example, output
increases not justified on the basis of current economic conditions.

Comparison of the overall patterns of the CU indices yields
several other interesting implications. Consider the "preferred" two

quasi-fixed input model CU measures. In the first few years and in

and current value terms, inducing additional investment. In the late

of 1969 and 1973.

The last productivity adjustment to consider is that for NCRTS. The

the final column of Table 2 indicate that although

overall productivity growth estimates 1949—1979 are substantial with

effects of scale economies purged, this is not true for 1973—1979. In
fact for the two quasi-fixed input case the reverse is true for 1973-1979.

The difference in growth rates for both models between the earlier and
later years is diminished further with this adaptation.

Recall that this scale adjustment recognizes the difference between

decreasing costs due to (i) pure technical progress and (ii) scale
economies. Over the 1949-1973 time period on average both of these
effects were evident. As a result, removing the scale effect imputes a
lower growth rate to technical progress. However, when output grows at a
lower or negative rate, the reverse can occur, i.e., lower productivity
growth is incorrectly attributed to reductions in the growth rate of

technical progress. During the sluggish growth years of 1973-1979 this
appears to have occurred; productivity change adjusted for this effect
increases to over 40% of the observed productivity change 1949-1979, and
to over 60% of that observed from 1965 to 1973.

In summary, empirical decomposition of the productivity residual to
isolate the technical progress effects independently of subequilibrium,

anticipatory behavior, and economies of scale yields important overall

conclusions. These include:

(1) the anomaly of the observed post-1973

productivity growth slowdown measured using conventional methods appears
overstated;

(ii) the primary impact generating this measured result is,

—32—

in a one quasi-fixed input model, that of anticipatory expectations;

however, if the model incorporates two quasi-fixed inputs then the

primary cause is that of subequilibrium, and (iii) the productivity
growth slowdown appears to have begun earlier than 1973, perhaps as
early as 1965.

This empirical exercise indicates that distinct effects of various
components of observed productivity growth can be identified using the
procedures developed in this paper, and illustrates the richness of the

decomposition framework. Significantly, the adjustments do not
necessarily decrease the productivity residual or "measure of our

ignorance." In fact, overall they increase the residual in all periods
discussed. Nonetheless, they do indicate that much of the relative
productivity growth slowdown can be attributed to a combination of
these impacts.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

In

these concluding remarks I briefly summarize how different

existing approaches to subequilibrium productivity measurement can be
viewed as special cases of the model developed here.
In many previous studies researchers have attempted to purge

cyclical effects from their productivity calculations by comparing only

"peak" years in the cycle. The justification offered for such a

this level are not a factor affecting productivity growth. The theoretical model outlined in this paper suggests that this approach is
valid provided measured CU is the same in each of these peak years.
The framework presented here also reveals that CU, calculated
appropriately, involves a total output or total cost measure and thus

adjusts all input shares in the productivity calculation rather than

only one input, say capital. However, if utilization only of capital is
varying, this approach justifies the use of a capital utilization
measure to adjust the capital share in productivity calculations, as long
as the shares are re-scaled to equal unity.. For example, the method
advocated by Berndt and Fuss (1981) is a special case of the capacity
utilization approach presented here, where the shadow value of capital——

represented by Tobin's q——is interpreted as a measure of the utilization
of capital compared to its long run equilibrium. Similarly, Hulten
(1983) presents a method of adjusting productivity measures for
capital utilization by recognizing shifts in cost curves from the
short run revaluation of capital.

More generally, the cost CU measure with one quasi-fixed input not

—34—

only includes all the information contained in Tobin's q--for both

indicators depend on a comparison between Zk and

--but also is

directly dual to the quantity side. The primal output CU measure,
incorporating the effects of utilization of the quasi-fixed input(s)

on output, also depends on the deviation between

and

The

.

shadow revaluation concept and the more conventional quantity—based

capacity utilization adjustment can thus be recognized and reconciled
as "two sides of the same coin."
In addition, with only one quasi-fixed input, capital, cost or

output Cu measures are a function only of capital utilization. In the
more general case with multiple quasi—fixed inputs, the economic
derivation of CU measures provides a justification for optimally
weighting the utilization of the individual quasi—fixed inputs into an
overall CU subequilibrium measure, and therefore contains more

information than Tobin's q.
The incorporation of nonstatic expectations into the models is

also important. The existence of nonstatic expectations implies that
if firms expect increases in output demand or input prices that will

increase present value costs of investing in the future relative to the
present, current anticipatory investment will be carried out which will

appear excessively high given current levels of capacity. This will
result in lower levels of CU and lower levels of productivity for
variable inputs than if the firm were myopic.

Empirically this framework provides a useful structure within which
to assess the productivity residual by identifying independently the
effects that should not be attributed solely to technical progress.
Although this study does not provide an explanation of the residual in the

—35—

sense that the residual after the adjustments is larger than before, it

does provide important insights. Analysis of the productivity residual
suggests, for example, that even with CU adjustments the productivity

slowdown commenced at an earlier date than is often assumed. Since
dating the "productivity slowdown" and the impact of CU adjustments on
this dating is a point of contention in the literature, the framework

presented here is particularly relevant for assessing the alternative
irgiimntS -

In

summary, the integration of the various technical and behavioral

impacts considered in the model developed here provides a systematic
framework that incorporates a number of existing approaches as special

cases. It therefore provides a useful framework within which to assess,
both theoretically and empirically, productivity growth and its inter-

relation with cyclical indicators such as Tobin's q and CU. Finally,
it is a particularly useful structure within which to pursue more
extensive empirical research on comparison of differential international productivity trends and analysis of more micro data such as that
for electric utilities, where the interactions between productivity and
CU and the effects of fixity of different inputs are of crucial
importance.

See Morrison (1984) for a related discussion of the use of this
shadow value of investment. Note that the use of the gross value of
= GK) depends on
capital ZkK = -GkK or the net value ZkK =
the relevant problem and interpretation. The net value should be used
when the dynamic optimization framework is explicitly characterized, but
in principle adjustment costs are not observed and therefore may not be
picked up in conventional measures. This provides one reason firms may
appear to be further from optimal Y than is actually the case;
Morrison (1984) shows that the gross measures more closely pick up
trends in the traditional measures. Numerically, however, for the
output and cost-CU indices the results differ very little between the
net and gross specifications.

See Berndt, Fuss and Waverman (1979) for an extensive discussion
of these types of elasticities.

The form of this representation for Ccy was
(1983c) from Lau (1978) with only one quasi-fixed
behavior. This results in d2.nC/d9.nY = C/aY(Y/C)

The first term on the right hand side of (5a) is the traditional
characterization of long run productivity. The latter two terms
capture the adjustment of the "augmented" quasi-fixed input stocks to the
"desired" level corresponding to exogenous variables including the new
output level and includes the costs of this adjustment represented by
3j/kj . Because of CRTS it must be the case both that j/x-Y/Y = d2.n

The basis for this assertion stems from Morrison (1983b) and
Nickell (1978), where it is shown that the path of capital, or the
investment plan given a current capital stock, can be represented by a
flexible accelerator adjustment path toward the current "target" capital
stock defined in terms of current exogenous variables plus a term
capturing the effect of all future exogenous variable changes.

The data on prices and quantities of output, capital, nonproduction

Manufacturing 1947-1981 were graciously provided by Ernst R. Berndt and
David 0. Wood. For a discussion of these data, which were constructed
similarly to those reported in Berndt and Wood (1975), see Berndt and
Wood (1984).

Note that any model which allows these elasticities to be calculated
11
may be used as the basis for empirical application of this decomposition
procedure. For example, any econometric model based on a short run or
"restricted" cost function allowing for NCRTS can be used to determine
the impact of subequilibrium and NCRTS on productivity. Distinguishing
the effects of adjustment costs and nonstatic expectations, however,
requires a full dynamic model and an explicit expectations process
respectively.
