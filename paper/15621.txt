The Greenness of China: Household Carbon Dioxide Emissions and Urban Development
Siqi Zheng, Rui Wang, Edward L. Glaeser, and Matthew E. Kahn
NBER Working Paper No. 15621
December 2009
JEL No. Q5
ABSTRACT
China urbanization is associated with both increases in per-capita income and greenhouse gas emissions.
This paper uses micro data to rank 74 major Chinese cities with respect to their household carbon
footprint. We find that the “greenest” cities based on this criterion are Huaian and Suqian while the
“dirtiest” cities are Daqing and Mudanjiang. Even in the dirtiest city (Daqing), a standardized household
produces only one-fifth of that in America’s greenest city (San Diego). We find that the average January
temperature is strongly negatively correlated with a city’s household carbon footprint, which suggests
that current regional economic development policies that bolster the growth of China’s northeastern
cities are likely to increase emissions. We use our city specific income elasticity estimates to predict
the growth of carbon emissions in China’s cities.

I. Introduction

Today, per capita carbon emissions in the United States are about five times per capita
emissions in China, which implies that if China’s per capita greenhouse gas emissions rose to
U.S. levels, then global carbon emissions would increase by more than 50 percent. While forty
percent of U.S. emissions are associated with residential and personal transportation, a much
smaller share of Chinese emissions come from these sectors, which suggests that Chinese
household carbon emissions could rise dramatically China’s urban population has grown by 300
million since 1990, and China is investing in the infrastructure needed for hundreds of millions
of future urbanites. China’s urban development policies could have large potential impacts on
global carbon emissions.
Knowing a nation’s per-capita income and total population size is not sufficient for judging
its household sector’s greenhouse gas production. The spatial distribution of this population
across diverse cities is key determinant of the size of the aggregate emissions. In this paper, we
estimate the carbon emissions associated with the development of different Chinese cities. The
more dramatic these differences are, the larger the impact that urban policy can have on Chinese
and global carbon emissions.
Using U.S. data, Glaeser and Kahn (2010) found that places with moderate temperatures, like
coastal California, have significantly lower emissions than places with extreme temperatures,
like Texas: a standardized household’s carbon emissions are 78 percent higher in Memphis than
in San Diego. Denser places have lower carbon emissions than sprawling car-oriented locales.
If these relationships hold in China as well, denser development in the more temperate locales of
that country will lead to lower carbon emissions.
2

In this paper, we calculate household carbon emissions using several data sources including
the Chinese Urban Household Survey. This survey provides information on energy usage for
25,000 households across 74 cities. Relative to U.S households, transportation represents a
smaller share of Chinese urban household emissions and household heating represents a much
larger share. A poorer country can do without air conditioning and cars, but not without winter
warmth.
As in Glaeser and Kahn (2010), we are not attempting to estimate an average carbon
“footprint,” but rather the marginal emissions associated with the movement of a typical new
family to a particular locale. For that reason, we calculate a predicted level of carbon emissions
in different places for a standardized household with a fixed size and level of income. We do not
follow Glaeser and Kahn (2010) and look at disproportionately newer housing to get a better
sense of the impact of the latest housing. But given how new most Chinese cities are, an average
home in Shanghai is far more likely to be relatively new than an average home in Detroit.
Even though we attempt to hold individual income constant, we find that richer cities have
significantly higher household carbon emissions, which was not true in the U.S. One possible
explanation for this fact is that richer cities may have invested more in infrastructure that
complements energy use. In China, carbon emissions are particularly high in places with cold
Januarys, because of centralized home heating. For example, Shanghai (without centralized
home heating) is much greener than Beijing (with centralized home heating). The prominent
role played by central production of heat indicates that carbon emissions could fall significantly
if greener sources of energy were used by the government for that purpose, as argued by Almond
et al. (2009).

3

China currently has three significant regional policies, which support growth in the
Northeast, the Western hinterland and the Beijing-Tianjin-Bohai Sea region. Relative to the
average city household, carbon emissions are 69 percent higher in the Northeast, 40 percent
higher in the Beijing-Tianjin-Bohai Sea region and 17 percent lower in the West. These findings
suggest that regional development policies that favor growth in the Northeast and in the greater
Beijing areas are likely to increase China’s overall carbon emissions.
The range of emissions across China’s cities today does not capture the diversity of possible
long run outcomes. We use our cross-sectional estimates to predict the increase in Chinese
household emissions by 2026 if Chinese incomes increase by 200 percent. We find that the
increases predicted by current cross-sectional relationships are quite modest, relative to the
current gap between the U.S. and China. Yet to us, this only serves to illustrate the range of
possibilities for Chinese emissions.
If Chinese households in 2026 behave like richer versions of Chinese households today, then
emissions will grow only modestly. New energy efficiency policy initiatives, such as China’s
recent announcement of its intent to reduce its carbon intensity (CO2/GNP) by 40 percent by the
year 2020, can offset some of the pollution consequences of growth. 1

But if China invests in

infrastructure and changes its urban forms so that China looks more like the United States, then
emissions of both China and the world will increase dramatically.

Some of the most important

environmental decisions in the 21st century may concern the development patterns of Chinese
cities and it surely worth better understanding the environmental consequences of those
decisions.

II. Household Carbon Production and Urban Development in a Developing Country
Urban infrastructure is long lived, and decisions made decades ago still shape older cities like
London and New York. In declining areas, like Detroit, where there is little new construction,
history is even more important. Today, China is making choices over investments in roads,
public transit, electricity generation and housing that will have implications for resource
consumption and greenhouse gas production for decades. The combination of irreversibility of
investment, and China’s vast size, makes its current development decisions relevant for longterm global carbon emissions.
No nation, including China, has a unilateral incentive to tax carbon emissions so that actions
internalize global consequences of greenhouse gases. As Glaeser and Kahn (2010) note, in the
absence of an appropriate carbon tax, there will be lower social costs created when urban activity
locates in a low emissions place rather than a high emissions place. There may also be
distortions that come from other public policies, like subsidizing highways or homeownership,
that encourage energy intensive lifestyles.
The size of the externality associated with a household locating in place A rather than place
B equals the increase in carbon emissions in place A minus the decrease in emissions in place B
times the social cost of carbon emissions minus the current carbon tax. We will provide new
estimates of these externality costs for 74 major Chinese cities. These estimates will allow us to

5

evaluate the unintended environmental consequences of China’s current regional development
policies. 2
Throughout this paper, we will focus solely on carbon dioxide emissions as our measure of
city “greenness.” In recent work (see Zheng, Kahn and Liu 2010), we have examined how
ambient particulate levels and sulfur dioxide levels vary across 35 major Chinese cities as a
function of city per-capita income and FDI. Unlike carbon emissions, these other forms of
pollution typically decline with income after a certain point, known as the peak of the
Environmental Kuznets Curve turning point. For that reason, we expect that further increases in
Chinese per-capita income will be associated with local pollution reductions. For example,
China is now phasing in Euro IV new vehicle emissions standards in Beijing, which seems likely
to reduce smog, because of improved transit service and more effective travel demand
management.
In this paper, we focus on household energy consumption. In the U.S., the household carbon
emissions account for 40 percent of total carbon emissions, while in China this share is less than
twenty percent. However, the household’s share of total per-capita carbon emissions will surely
grow as China transitions from being a manufacturing economy to being a service economy. As
domestic households become richer they will consume more electricity and the demand for

Assessing the size of the environmental externality from migration requires us to know the
marginal impact of an extra household on carbon emission, but we will only be able to measure
average emissions. Marginal and average emissions may differ because of increasing or
decreasing returns in the production of energy. We have no way of addressing this problem and
cannot even be sure of the direction of the bias. Average and marginal emissions may also
diverge because new households are more likely to live in larger or more energy-efficient homes
or homes on the urban edge.

private transportation services will increase. 3

The industrial sector is a major consumer of

energy in China. Several studies have examined the industrial sector using decomposition
techniques to study the role of industrial scale, composition and technique effects in explaining
trends over time (see Huang 1993, Sinton and Levine 1994, Sinton and Fridley 2000, Shi and
Polenske 2006).

III. Measuring Household Greenhouse Gas Emissions in China’s Major Cities
We estimate how much carbon dioxide emissions a standardized Chinese household
produces per year if it resides within one of China’s 74 cities, including all the 35 major cities
(all municipalities directly under the federal government, provincial capital cities, and quasiprovincial capital cities) plus some cities that have enough sample observations. We focus on
four major household sources of carbon dioxide emissions; transportation, residential electricity
consumption, residential heating and domestic fuel. The following equation provides an
accounting framework for organizing our empirical work.
Emissions = γ1*Transportation +γ2*Electricity + γ3*Heating +γ4*Domestic Fuel

(1)

Our main goal is to estimate equation (1) for each Chinese major city for a standardized
household. In this equation, transportation represents energy use from a vector of activities
including liters of annual gasoline consumed for households that own a car. Transportation also
includes miles traveled on cabs, and the energy use of buses and subways. All forms of energy

3

Our study will focus on transportation, and household consumption of energy to provide heating and cooling
services. We recognize that households consume other products (such as what they eat) that have carbon
consequences.

7

use are multiplied by an emissions factor vector defined as γ1. For example, each liter of # 93
gasoline consumed produces 2.226 Kg of carbon dioxide.
The second term in this equation represents carbon dioxide emissions from residential
electricity consumption. In the U.S., Glaeser and Kahn (2010) found a tight link between
electricity consumption and hot summers, presumably because of extensive use of air
conditioning. To convert electricity usage into carbon emissions, we must use the regional area
power plants’ average emissions factor, denoted by γ2, defined as carbon dioxide emissions per
megawatt hour of power generated. Coal fired power plants have a higher emissions factor than
natural gas fired power plants or power plants that run on renewable power such as wind, hydro,
or solar power.
Major Chinese cities differ with respect to their geography and available natural
resources that can be used for energy. For instance, some are located in regions that receive more
of their power from power plants with a lower emissions factor. In our calculations we report
below, we will use recent regional emissions factors for power plants as an input in ranking cities
with respect to household carbon emissions based on equation (1). It is important to note that
today’s average emissions factor may not be an accurate estimate of future regional emissions
factors if China were to sign a global carbon reduction treaty.
China’s cities differ greatly with respect to their winter temperatures. Northern cities are
much colder than southern cities. In northern Chinese cities, heat is provided publicly through a
system that provides a fixed amount of heating between November 15 and March 15. Prior to the
1980s, heating was considered a basic right and the government provided free heating (which is

8

called the “centralized heating system”) for homes and offices, either directly or through stateowned enterprises. The legacy of this system remains today.
The cities north of the Huai River and Qinling Mountains continue to receive subsidized
heating in winter months, while the southern cities are not entitled to centralized heating.
Individual households are unable to control the indoor temperature when centralized heating is
provided. Given these points, we assume that energy usage for heating is proportional to the
floor area of the home. This sector creates high level of emissions because heating’s main
energy source is coal (Almond et. al., 2009).
The fourth term in the equation is emissions from domestic fuels, which are also used, in
some cases, to heat homes. This term includes three components; coal, liquefied petroleum gas
(LPG), and coal gas. Coal is inexpensive, but it is carbon intensive. A byproduct of using it is
elevated ambient air pollution level such as sulfur dioxide, and particulates. LPG and coal gas
are extracted from petroleum oil and coal, and are much cleaner and less carbon intensive.

Data Description
Our first source of data is the Chinese Urban Household Survey (UHS) in the year 2006.
This survey is conducted annually by the Urban Survey Department of the State Statistic Bureau
of China. The survey targets households living in cities and towns for more than half a year. The
data collected from the survey is primarily used for estimating the urban consumer expenditure
component in GDP and CPI. The annual UHS that we use in this paper includes approximately
25,300 observations across the 74 cities. We compute the carbon emissions from electricity use,
private car, taxi, and three domestic fuels based on this micro data set. The survey also provides

9

information on city economic and demographic variables such as per household income,
household size, and age of household head. Since many households in northern cities still
receive free heating services, there is no record of heating expenditure in the UHS.
Given the current relatively low private vehicle ownership level in China, it is important
to measure public transportation’s contribution to the average household’s carbon emissions.
The China Urban Statistic Yearbooks provide us with city level information, such as energy
consumption information on buses and subways. We have the electricity consumption in 2006
for each of the ten cities with a subway system. In the case of buses, converting fuel use into
carbon emissions is straightforward. For electricity-powered subways, the conversion of energy
use into carbon requires additional information about power production.
To construct common units measured in tons of carbon dioxide, we need access to carbon
emissions factors associated with both electricity production and public home heating. The data
for these items comes from various sources. The carbon emission factors of regional power grid,
γ2, come from the Department of Climate Change of the National Development Research Center
of the State Council. The energy consumption involved in centralized heating comes from the
Department of Environmental Engineering and Department of Building Science in Tsinghua
University.
Table One lists the names, definitions, means and standard deviations of our key
variables. Table Two reports the summary statistics. The average household in our sample has
an annual income of 40 thousand Yuan, or 5.7 thousand dollars. It consumes 1,700 kWh of
electricity and spends 130 Yuan on taxis in 2006. Across our 74 city sample, 16.4% of the
25,300 households own cars. Auto ownership in Chinese cities is growing rapidly as incomes

10

escalate. Between 2002 and 2007, the number of private cars in Beijing increased from 1.5 to 3
million.

Pooled Cross-City Regressions Results
To estimate the components of equation (1), we will estimate separate city specific
regressions for relevant carbon producing activities such as electricity and gasoline consumption.
These city specific regressions allow us to predict energy consumption for a standardized
household in each of the 74 cities. This procedure generates an unwieldy number of regression
coefficients, but generally these regression coefficients are similar in magnitude across places.
We first use the household micro data to estimate the determinants of Chinese household
energy use. We regress travel behavior, household electricity use, heating consumption and
domestic fuel consumption on city fixed effects and basic demographics. In the case of
household electricity consumption, we estimate:
Log(Electricity)= City Fixed Effects + b1*Log(Income) + b2*Household Size + b3*Age of
Household Head + U

(2)

The unit of analysis is household j in city k. Note that the regression coefficients do not have
city specific subscripts. In the results reported in Table Three, we include city specific fixed
effects but impose the constraint that household demographics have the same marginal effects on
energy consumption across cities. Our final estimates relax this assumption, but since this
produces an enormous number of coefficients, we report the more consolidated estimates.

11

With the exception of electricity consumption and taxi gas consumption, we estimate the
other energy consumption regressions using a Heckman two-step procedure.

Many households

in our sample have literally zero consumption of a specific fuel. For example, in Beijing, we
estimate the car ownership rate to be 23 percent. Thus, in this relatively wealthy city 77 percent
of households are consuming zero gasoline and the remaining 23 percent are consuming a
positive quantity of gasoline. In Shanghai, the vehicle ownership rate is even lower (16.4
percent) due to higher population density and a license plate quota policy. The same issue arises
for household consumption of three domestic fuels (coal, coal gas and LPG), where many
households consume none of particular fuel.
In implementing the Heckman two-step estimator for each of these categories of energy
consumption, we use a first stage probit of the form:
Prob(consume fuel j) = f( b1*Log(Income) + b2*Household Size + b3*Age of Household Head)
(3)
In the second stage, we estimate Log(consumption| consumption>0) = c1*Log(Income) + e (4)
We have no theoretical reasons for including variables in the participation equation but
not the consumption equation, but small sample sizes led us to exclude age and household size
from the second stage regression. Our sample sizes conditional on positive energy consumption
(especially when we stratify by city) are small so age and household size effects were extremely
imprecisely measured. This procedure therefore corrects for the tendency of places with
differently aged or larger households to have more cars or more strictly positive amounts of LPG
consumption, but it does not correct for any connection between age or household size and
consumption, conditional upon consumption being positive.

12

The results in Table 3 indicate that taxi use is a luxury good with an income elasticity
greater than one. Car ownership and gasoline consumed have high income elasticities. The
income elasticity of electricity consumption is 0.29. Richer urban Chinese households are
moving up the energy ladder by substituting away from dirty home heating fuels such as coal and
increasing consumption of cleaner fuels such as electricity and coal gas. These urban China
results are in accord with past household Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) work by Pfaff et.
al. (2004). Richer people consume cleaner energy sources and this can reduce local air
pollution despite a rising quantity of consumption. Coal and LPG are both inferior goods, whose
use declines with income (but if a household uses coal, the coal consumption rises with income),
while the use of coal gas, the cleanest of these energy sources, increases with income. Coal gas
is transmitted through pipes directly into households, while LPG is less convenient and coal is
far dirtier.

City-Specific Income Elasticities
We use the UHS data to estimate city specific regressions for household consumption of
gasoline, electricity, coal, LPG and coal gas that allow the coefficients to vary by city. Each of
these regressions has the same form as those reported in Table Three but in this case, we now
have 222 (74 cities and three explanatory variables) separate coefficient estimates for income,
household size and age. We report only the income coefficients in Table Four. Economic
growth will surely continue in China; these income coefficients suggest which cities may be
particularly likely to increase energy consumption over time.

13

There are sizable differences in the relationship between household income and energy
consumption across cities. The table highlights the cross-city heterogeneity with regards to
income effects. Shanghai’s income elasticity of private car fuel consumption (conditioning on
ownership) is two times larger than the income elasticity in Beijing. The income elasticity of
electricity consumption is 0.163 in Beijing, 0.171 in Shanghai and 0.445 in Zibo. Assuming that
these year 2006 cross-sectional income elasticities do not change over time, we use the estimates
reported in Table Four to forecast how ongoing urban growth will affect energy consumption in
different Chinese cities. For example, economic development in Zibo will lead to greater
electricity consumption than in Beijing.

IV. Measuring Household Carbon Emissions across Chinese Cities
To measure the carbon emissions of our 74 Chinese cities based on carbon dioxide
emissions, we use the estimated city-specific energy consumptions for seven energy types for a
standardized household and then convert that energy use into carbon dioxide emissions. The
standardized household is defined as a household with an annual income of 40,000 Yuan or
5,714 dollars, 3 members and a household head of 45 years old, which are the means of these
three variables of the whole sample. By predicting the carbon dioxide emission of a standardized
household, we are able to answer; “if a household moved from city I to city j, would aggregate
carbon emissions rise or fall?”
In estimating the regression equations (2, 3,4), we control for demographics but not for
housing characteristics. After all, we are not attempting to estimate emissions assuming that
people in Beijing live in Huaian’s “Southern-Huai -River” small town style homes. If

14

households live in smaller homes in more expensive areas, then the resulting reduction in carbon
emissions should be attributed to that location.
Household Electricity
Based on equation (2), we estimate 74 city specific electricity consumption regressions.
To provide one salient example, in equation (5) we report our estimates based on the Shanghai
sample of 1,018 households.
Log(Electricity Use)= 3.58 + 0.33*Log(Income) + 0.10*Household Size - 0.0005*Age
(0.29) (0.03)
(0.02)
(0.001)

(5)

Standard errors are reported in parentheses. In this regression, the R-squared is 0.199. We
take these regression coefficients and predict the annual electricity consumption for a household
living in Shanghai, with an income of 40,000 Yuan, 3 members and a household head of 45 years
old. The result is 1494.9 kilowatt hours (kWh). We then multiply this number by the electricity
conversion factor in Shanghai (0.8154 tCO2/mWh), which is γ2 in Equation (1). This yields a
prediction for the standardized household equal to 1.219 tons of carbon dioxide emissions.
These steps yield an estimate of γ2*Electricity (see equation 1) for each city.
The electricity conversion factor (power plant emission factor, γ2) is a key parameter that
varies by region across China. Seven electricity grids (six regional grids on the Mainland plus
one on the Hainan Island) support most of China’s power consumption. The baseline emission
factors (at both operating margin and build margin) for regional power grids are estimated for
recent years by the Office of National Coordination Committee on Climate Change, a department
within the National Development and Reform Commission.
Car and Taxi Usage

15

For private cars, we use the city-specific two-stage Heckman model to predict a
standardized household’s fuel consumption (fuel consumption taken to be 0 when unobserved).
In the case of car usage in Beijing, for example, the selection equation is:
Prob(Owning a car) =
f (-8.84 + 0.81*Log(Income)-0.003*Household Size - 0.015*Age of household head) (6)
(0.861)

(0.079)

(0.051)

(0.003)

Standard errors are in parentheses. The consumption equation, given the household owns a car, is:
Log( Car Fuel Use| Car ownership =1)= 4.52+ 0.27*Log(Income)
(6.599) (0.519)

(7)

Standard errors are in parentheses. In the above Heckman two-step estimation, there are
2,081 observations. From the first step regression we predict that the standardized household has
a 18.4% probability of owning a car. Using both equations, we predict that the standardized
household’s expected fuel consumption is 292.2 liters per year. We then convert fuel
consumption into carbon emissions using standard gas conversion measures. We employ a
similar procedure to predict a standardized household’s emissions from taxi use in each of the 74
cities.
Bus and Subway Emissions
The UHS expenditure data do not provide us with reliable estimates of the mileage and
energy consumed by households using public transit. To overcome this problem, we use

16

aggregate data in China Urban Statistic Yearbooks and additional sources. 4 The Yearbooks
provide data on the total numbers of standard buses, LPG buses and CNG buses. We assume that
the bus operating rate is 90 percent, and every bus travels approximately 150 kilometers per day.
The fuel consumption of a standard bus is 25 liters per 100 km. A LPG (or CNG) bus consumes
three-fourths of the fuel that a conventional bus consumes for an equal distance. We then
calculate each city’s total bus fuel consumption and divide by the total number of households in
the city. Standard conversion factors transform per household fuel consumption to per
household carbon emission.
There are only 10 Chinese cities that have subway lines: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou,
Shenzhen, Tianjin, Dalian, Changchun, Nanjing, Wuhan, and Chongqing. There is no public data
available on the electricity usage of subways, so we must rely on private governmental data. We
follow the same procedure as we followed for estimating bus emissions by city. For each city,
we calculate total electricity consumption by the subway system and then divide this by the
city’s household count. This yields an estimate of a city’s per-household average electricity
consumption from subway use. We then use region-specific conversion factors to estimate the
carbon emissions associated with subway electricity usage in each city. The total carbon
emission from transportation sector is the sum of the above four sub-categories: private car, taxi,
bus, and subway.
Fuel and Heating Emissions
We apply the Heckman two-stage procedure (see equations 4 and 5) to predict a
standardized household’s carbon emissions from home fuel use. For three types of fuel, coal,
4

Glaeser and Kahn (2010) follow the same strategy in their United States study ranking cities with respect to their
household carbon footprint.

17

LPG and coal gas, we first estimate the probability the standardized household uses this fuel type,
and then predict the consumption quantity conditional upon using the fuel. We calculate
expected fuel consumption for each source and then multiply this by standard conversion factors
to predict total carbon emissions.
Since many households in northern cities still receive free heating services, there is no
record of heating expenditure in the UHS, beyond the three fuel types discussed above. In
markets where there is centralized heating, there is no heating meter since heat is provided by the
state for free in fixed quantities.

The best predictor of energy usage in such households, that we

know of, is floor area. Tsinghua University’s Department of Building Science and Department
of Environmental Engineering provided us with conversion factors that indicate how much
carbon dioxide is emitted when heating a square meter of living space in each province for a
given outside temperature .
We then multiply this conversion factor times the predicted amount of floor space for an
average household. Using UHS information on each household’s housing unit size, we estimate
a city specific regression (similar to equation 2) where home unit size is regressed on income and
demographics. Using this regression, we predict expected square footage for a standardized
house and then multiply this by the province-specific home heating conversion factors to predict
total carbon emissions in each of our 74 cities.
China’s Greenest Cities Based on the Household CO2 Metric
Combining the components in equation (1) then enables us to rank China’s 74 major
cities with respect to total carbon emission per standardized household. The results are shown in

18

Table Five. Table Five’s first 9 columns report our sectoral estimates for this standardized
household in each of the 74 cities. The units are tons of CO2.
China’s major cities’ household carbon emissions are dramatically lower than in the U.S.
Glaeser and Kahn (2010) report that in the cleanest cities (San Diego and San Francisco), a
standardized household emits around 26 tons of CO2 per year. 5 Shanghai’s standardized
household produces 1.8 tons of carbon and Beijing’s standardized household produces 4.0 tons.
Even in China’s brownest city, Daqing, a standardized household emits only one-fifth of the
carbon produced by a standardized household in America’s greenest cities. Table Five presents
our ranking in order from Greenest to Brownest. The top ten cities are: Huanian, Suqian, Haikou,
Nantong, Nanchang, Taizhou, Zhengjian, Shaoxing, Xining, and Xuzhou. The bottom ten sorted
from worst to relatively cleaner are; Daqing, Mudanjiang, Beijing, Qiqihaer, Yingchuan,
Shenyang, Haerbin, Dalian, Baotou, and Liaoyang.
Figure 1 shows the per household carbon dioxide emissions in each of the 74 cities on a
GIS map. High levels of carbon emissions are particularly common in the north, which reflects
the cold temperatures and government heating policy. Coastal cities also have higher emissions,
perhaps because they are somewhat more developed. Eight of the ten greenest cities in our
sample are located just south of the centralized heating border in the coastal provinces. These
cities are not entitled to winter heating services and their summers are not exceptionally hot.
Daqing, China’s oil capital, has dramatically higher carbon emissions than any other city.
The Chinese heating system is coal-based and highly-subsidized. Most of the heat is
derived from coal-fired heat-only boilers or combined heat and power generators, which are
5

Glaeser and Kahn’s standardized U.S urban household has an income of $62,500. Obviously, this is a much
higher income level than for the standardized Chinese urban household.

19

inefficient in energy usage compared to electric, gas and oil heating systems in industrial
countries (T.J. Wang et al., 2000; Yi Jiang, 2007). If China’s home heating system were to be
dramatically changed, perhaps using far less carbon intensive energy sources, then this could
certainly change the rankings of cities.
The results reported in Table Five are measured in tons of carbon dioxide per household.
We use an estimate of $35 per ton as the marginal social cost of one ton of carbon dioxide. This
is a conservative estimate relative to the Stern report (2008), which suggests a cost of carbon
dioxide that is twice this amount. This value lies in the middle of the range reported by Metcalf
(2007). 6
Given our estimates of the spatial differences in household carbon emissions across,
China’s cities we find that moving the average household from the greenest city to the brownest
would cause a social externality of $136.5 (35*(5.1-1.2)) per year. This is roughly 2.5 percent
of a year’s income. If the northern cities substitute away from coal for home heating, or if the
richer cities invest more in subways or other forms of transit, this gap could narrow. 7
Conversely, increases in income could cause some of the differences in consumption to widen.
We will explore these possibilities in Section VI.
A city’s carbon emissions is just one indicator of its “greenness,” but it the component of
greenness that seems most likely to have an impact outside the city and country of residence.
Zheng, Kahn and Liu (2009) use hedonic methods to rank China’s major 35 cities. A major

It is relevant to note that carbon tax policy proposals have suggested taxes per ton of carbon dioxide roughly in this
range. Metcalf (2007) proposes a bundled carbon tax and a labor tax decrease. As shown in his Figure Six, he
proposes that the carbon tax start at $15 per ton (in year 2005 dollars) now and rise by 4% a year. Under this
proposal, the carbon tax per ton of carbon dioxide would equal $60 per ton (in year 2005 dollars) by 2050.
7
Northern cities should be aware of the local ambient pollution problems caused by household coal use. After the
horrific deaths in the great 1952 London Fog, the city banned home coal use. While households have little incentive
to curb their greenhouse gas emissions, the cost of local pollution (caused by coal burning) provides a direct
incentive to consider encouraging substitution to cleaner fuels.

20

component in their quality of life index calculation is city air quality, measured by small
particulate matter, PM10. We calculate the correlation between the 35 cities’ PM10 levels and our
per-household carbon emission. These two sets of rankings have a positive correlation
coefficient of 0.33. In the colder northern cities, people burn coal to produce home and office
heating creating both particulates and carbon dioxide emissions.
Understanding Cross-City Differences in Carbon Emissions
Table Six reports the correlation between our carbon emissions estimates and city-level
attributes including population, population growth, income, temperature and urban form.
Population is positively correlated with emissions from use of taxis, buses and electricity.
Unsurprisingly, larger cities tend to be more transit oriented and less dependent on cars.
Population density is associated with lower levels of emissions from taxi use and buses. An
increase of 1,000 people per square km (about 19% of the sample standard deviation) on average
is associated with a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions per household of 0.424 ton from use
of taxis and 0.837 ton from the use of buses. This may indicate shorter average travel distance or
much more effective urban public transportation. Just as in the U.S., compact development leads
to lower carbon emissions.
There is a positive correlation between city-level income and carbon emissions, even
holding individual income constant. Higher income cities have higher emissions from
electricity, driving, and subways but lower emissions from taxis. One explanation for the link
between city-level income and emissions for a standardized household is that there is
mismeasurement in individual income and that city-level income is correlated with unobserved
household prosperity. A second explanation is that there is a social multiplier in certain types of

21

energy use. A third explanation is that higher income cities have built infrastructure that is
complementary with greater use of energy. When we form our projected energy use in a richer
China, we will combine both the income effects suggested by the individual regressions and the
city-level income elasticities.
Figure 2 shows the strong correlation between January temperature and carbon emissions,
which reflects both the natural tendency of colder places to require more heat and the home
heating rules that provide heat only to northern cities. A one standard deviation increase in
January temperature (8.66 degrees) is associated with a 0.29 ton decrease in carbon dioxide
emissions.

The temperature effect of January comes primarily from its impact on household

heating emissions – one degree higher in January temperature corresponds to 0.111 ton less CO2
emissions from heating. There are offsetting effects from the other energy sources.

V. The Environmental Consequences of China’s Regional Development Policy
Unlike the United States, China’s government is pursuing a well defined set of regional
growth policies. If successful, these policies will impact China’s overall carbon emissions. In
China, there are at least three significant programs that are intended to bolster the growth of
particular regions.

The Western Development Program launched in 1999 gives infrastructure

aid and support for industrial adjustment to western and inland provinces. The program attempts
to help heavy and defense industries convert to consumer goods production (Chow (2002: 174)).
China’s Northeast once benefited from the emphasis on heavy industry during the Mao years
(Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang). Since then, like the American Rustbelt, the Chinese northeast
has struggled with high unemployment, aging industry and infrastructure, and social welfare bills

22

(Saich 2001: 149). While the Western Development Program targets both urban and rural areas,
the Northeast Revitalization Program focuses on reinventing the declined cities.
A third program is targeted at the development of Beijing-Tianjin- Bohai Sea region. This
program intends to expedite the development of this northern mega-region to catch up the
Yangtze and Pearl River Deltas in the south. The 2008 Olympics caused a massive public
investment in infrastructure and environmental improvement. Centralized political power will
surely continue to attract physical and human capital to the region (Ades and Glaeser, 1995). 8
To assess the carbon production consequences of these programs would require a detailed
model of how each of these programs will influence the spatial distribution of Chinese urban
growth. To begin to address this topic, we calculate the regional household carbon emissions
factor by taking population weighted averages of our household carbon production measures
reported in Table Five. The weighted average of residential emissions in the Western region is
1.9 tons per household relative to 2.3 tons in the rest of the country. The weighted average
residential emissions in the cities impacted by northeastern regional development are 3.5 tons per
household. Emissions are 2.0 tons per household outside that region. Finally, the weighted
average emissions in the cities inside the Beijing-Tianjin-Bohai Sea region are 2.9 tons per
household, as opposed to 2.1 tons outside that region. The Northeast Revitalization Program and
the development program of Beijing-Tianjin- Bohai Sea region seem to be trying to bolster
growth in areas that have particularly high levels of carbon emissions. The Western
Development Program is encouraging the developments in the areas with slightly low levels of
carbon emissions.

8

There is the fourth regional development program called “Rise of Central China”, aiming to support the
development of central provinces. However, very few real policies came out since the launch of this program.

23

These results highlight how the environmental costs of regional policies can be
incorporated into a type of “green accounting” for estimating the full consequences of spatial
policies. Such externalities need to be put in the context of other policy objectives. Our
estimates just suggest that there are environmental consequences of regional policy. 9

VI. Future Carbon Emissions
China is changing so rapidly that current Chinese emissions only offer the vaguest sense of
what emissions will be like 20 years in the future. In this admittedly speculative section, we use
our income elasticity estimates to project household carbon emissions across Chinese cities 20
years in the future. We make the same assumptions about incomes and population levels in
2026. The assumptions are from authoritative research institutes in China: (1) Chinese urban per
capita incomes will increase 200 percent over 20 years, which would occur if urban incomes
grew at a 5.6 percent annual real rate. (source: Institute of Quantitative & Technical Economics,
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences); (2) Chinese urbanization rate will increase from 43.9% in
2006 to 62% in 2026, thus urban population growth is about 40 percent over 20 years. (source:
China Academy of Science)

9

Such hidden cost may be further increased if urbanization leads to more reliance on local and regional energy
sources. Fossil fuels are predominantly in the north, which has 90% of the oil and 80% of the coal reserves.
Hydropower remains the vast majority of renewable power (roughly 17% of the total electricity) generated in China.
Roughly two thirds of the hydropower is located in the south west region of China. In contrast to the distribution of
fossil and hydro energy, the east and south coastal areas have very little energy resources. Of course, the northern
part of the country has some potential in increasing its small but increasing share of renewable energy. Wind power
is concentrated in the northern provinces and the east and south coasts. The seasonal fluctuation of wind power is
complementary to hydropower, but the geographical distribution of land areas with rich wind power potential is to a
large extent different from that of the demand for power. In addition, international energy trade may help reduce the
northern cities’ carbon footprint. If the northern cities can import natural gas from Russia to substitute their coal use
to a significant level, the geography of urban carbon foot print will be different.

24

We then use our China-specific data to estimate emissions for 2026. To do this, we
create a composite regression that includes our predicted emissions for every household in the
UHS, including emissions from fuel, subways, cars and so forth. We then perform the following
regression:
Emissions=ai*Log(Income)+bi*Household Size+ci*Age+d* Log(City Population)+e *January
Temperature

(8)

Coefficients ai, bi and ci all differ by city. We first use this equation to predict the standardized
household’s carbon emissions in each of the 74 cities in 2006. We then predict for each city in
2026, the predicted emissions for a household with three members earning 120,000 Yuan, or
17,500 dollars in today’s currency (a 200% increase from 40,000 Yuan), assuming that the city’s
population has also risen in the manner discussed above. The predicted 2026 per-household
carbon emissions are listed in Column (3) in Table Seven. They essentially predict household
energy use assuming that China in 20 years looks essentially like a richer and more urbanized
version of China today. All cities have higher emission levels in 2026. On average, per
household carbon emission grows by 26% from 2006 to 2026. This extremely modest change
suggests that a richer China will have only a modest impact on global emissions.
But there are good reasons to be skeptical about that optimistic projection, which
essentially assumes that China in 2026 will look like a richer version of China today, not a
poorer version of the United States. Glaeser and Kahn (2010) calculated the emissions for a
household that earns 62,500 dollars, which is about 10.66 times richer than the Chinese
household investigated in this study. The median city in their United States sample had
household carbon emissions that are 20 times higher than the median city found here in China.

25

To explain this difference with income alone, the income elasticity of carbon emissions would
have to be 1.3, which is far higher than any of our estimates within China, or Glaeser and Kahn’s
estimates within the United States.
In other words, a comparison of the United States and China suggests that increases in
national income may be associated with far greater increases in carbon emissions increases in
income across country. Presumably, this greater cross-national difference adopts infrastructure
choices that are made at the city, region or national level and that would cause the aggregate
effects of income to be higher than the individual effects of income. Such effects may explain
why there was a correlation between emissions and city-income in China, holding individual
income constant.
If China’s middle class in the future starts uses energy like China’s wealthiest citizens
today, then China will have a modest impact on global emissions. If China’s middle class in the
future starts to use energy like the poorer Americans today, then global emissions will rise quite
significantly. The wide range between those alternatives suggests the large impact that different
investments in Chinese infrastructure will have on the world’s carbon emissions.

VI. Conclusion
China’s economic growth has profound environmental implications. Past research has
examined the greenhouse gas implications of this growth using an Environmental Kuznets Curve
framework either using national panel data (see Schmalensee, Stoker and Judson 1998) or using
regional aggregate data. Auffhammer and Carson (2008) create a panel data set for 30 Chinese

26

provinces covering the years 1985 to 2004. They also find that the relationship between
greenhouse gas emissions and per-capita income is increasing and concave.
In this paper, we find that some of the patterns of carbon emissions within China replicate
findings that hold in the United States and elsewhere. If economic growth takes place in
compact, public transit friendly, cool summer, warm winter cities, then the aggregate carbon
emissions will increase less than if economic growth takes place in “car dependent” cities
featuring hot summers and cold winters and where electricity is produced using coal fired power
plants.
Recognizing that diverse cities differ with respect to these characteristics, we have used
individual and institutional data to measure household carbon emissions across a sample of 74
Chinese cities. We have found that the “greenest” cities based on this criterion are Huaian and
Taizhou while the “dirtiest” cities are Daqing and Mudanjiang. However, even in China’s
brownest city, Daqing, a standardized household emits only one-fifth of the carbon produced by
a standardized household in America’s greenest city (San Diego).
The cross city differential in the carbon externality is “large”. At $35 per ton of damage
from carbon dioxide, moving a standardized household from Daqing to Huaian would reduce the
externality by roughly $136.5 per year, which is reasonably high relative to household per capita
income of 40,000 Yuan, or about 5800 dollars. This differential is mainly generated by cross
city differences in climate, centralized heating policy, regional electric utility emissions factors,
and urban form. Unlike the United States, China is pursuing major regional growth initiatives.
Our results highlight the presumably unintended adverse carbon consequence of encouraging
growth in the North.

27

Our study relies on cross-sectional data, and changes over time may not resemble
differences at a point in time. New technologies may radically reduce the carbon emissions
associated with certain types of energy production. Alternatively, China may invest more in
infrastructure, like highways, that complement heavy energy use. China will surely grow richer,
and the country is likely to use more energy. But the actual impact on carbon emissions, which
may be either modest or large, will depend on infrastructure and new technologies.

Notes: When estimating city-level regressions for car use, coal, LPG and coal gas, we did not employ Heckman two-step estimations when the use rate of the corresponding energy type is less than 5%
or larger than 95% in a city. For the former case, we set the corresponding energy use in that city to be zero; for the latter case, we use OLS estimations. T-statistics are reported in parentheses.
