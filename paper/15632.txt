Private Equity and Industry Performance

NBER Working Paper No. 15632
January 2010
JEL No. G24,G32
ABSTRACT
The growth of the private equity industry has spurred concerns about its potential impact on the economy
more generally. This analysis looks across nations and industries to assess the impact of private equity
on industry performance. Industries where PE funds have invested in the past five years have grown
more quickly in terms of productivity and employment. There are few significant differences between
industries with limited and high private equity activity. It is hard to find support for claims that economic
activity in industries with private equity backing is more exposed to aggregate shocks. The results
using lagged private equity investments suggest that the results are not driven by reverse causality.
These patterns are not driven solely by common law nations such as the United Kingdom and United
States, but also hold in Continental Europe.

1. INTRODUCTION
In response to the global financial crisis that began in 2007, governments worldwide are
rethinking their approach to regulating financial institutions. Among the financial institutions
that have fallen under the gaze of regulators have been private equity (PE) funds (see, for
instance, European Commission [2009]). There are many open questions regarding the economic
impact of PE funds, many of which cannot be definitively answered until the aftermath of the
buyout boom of the mid-2000s can be fully assessed.
This paper addresses one of these open questions, by examining the impact of PE
investments across 20 industries in 26 major nations between 1991 and 2007. We focus on
whether PE investments in an industry affect aggregate growth and cyclicality. In particular, we
look at the relationship between the presence of PE investments and the growth rates of
productivity, employment and capital formation. For our productivity and employment measures,
we find that PE investments are associated with faster growth. One natural concern is that this
growth may have come at the expense of greater cyclicality in the industry, which would
translate into greater risks for investors and stakeholders. Thus, we also examine whether
economic fluctuations are exacerbated by the presence of PE investments, but we find little
evidence that this is the case.
Throughout our analysis we measure the growth rate in a particular industry relative to
the average growth rate across countries in the same year. In addition, we use country and
industry fixed effects, so that the impact of PE activity is measured relative to the average
performance in a given country, industry, and year. For instance, if the Swedish steel industry
has more PE investment than the Finnish one, we examine whether the steel industry in these
1

two countries performs better or worse over time relative to the average performance of the steel
industry across all countries in our sample, and whether the variations in performance over the
industry cycles are more or less dramatic.
Overall, we are unable to find evidence supporting the detrimental effects of PE
investments on industries:
•

Industries where PE funds have been active in the past five years grow more rapidly than
other sectors, whether measured using total production, value added, or employment. In
industries with PE investments, there are few significant differences between industries
with a low and high level of PE activity.

•

Activity in industries with PE backing appears to be no more volatile in the face of
industry cycles than in other industries, and sometimes less so. The reduced volatility is
particularly apparent in employment.

•

These patterns continue to hold when we focus on the impact of private equity in
continental Europe, where concerns about these investments have been most often
expressed.

•

We believe it is unlikely that these results are driven by reverse causality, i.e. PE funds
selecting to invest in industries that are growing faster and/or are less volatile. The results
are essentially unchanged if we only consider the impact of PE investments made
between five and two years earlier on industry performance.
It is important to note that there are a number of limitations to this analysis. First, the

question of economic growth and volatility is only one of many questions that regulators must
grapple with when assessing the impact of PE investment. Second, we hope to deal more fully
2

with the question of reverse causality in subsequent versions of the study. Finally, it is still too
early to assess the consequences of the economic conditions in 2008 and 2009, a period where
the decrease of investment and absolute volume of distressed private equity-backed assets was
far greater than in earlier cycles.
The plan of this study is as follows: In the second section, we develop the hypotheses to
be tested. The third section describes the construction of the dataset and the results are presented
in Section 4. The final section concludes.
2. INDUSTRY PERFORMANCE AND PRIVATE EQUITY
There are several alternative perspectives that can be offered as to how PE investments
can affect the prospects of an industry. In this section, we begin by reviewing the suggestions
about changes regarding overall performance; we then turn to hypotheses regarding the
interaction between economic cycles and PE investments.
A. The impact of PE investments on industry performance
Our initial examination focuses on the performance of industries where PE funds have
been active relative to industries where these investors have not been active.
A central hypothesis since Jensen [1989] has been that private equity has the ability to
improve the operations of firms. By closely monitoring managers, restricting free cash flow
through the use of leverage and incentivizing managers with equity, it is argued, private equitybacked firms are able to improve operations in the firms they back. In this article, Jensen
suggested that these leveraged buyouts (LBOs) may not only affect the bought-out firm itself but
3

may also increase competitive pressure and force competitors to improve their own operations.
John et al. [1992] present supporting empirical evidence that the threat of takeover serves as a
spur for firms to voluntarily undertake restructurings.
The claim that private equity-backed firms have improved operations has been supported
by a number of empirical studies, which focus on the effects on the individual private equitybacked companies. Kaplan [1989] examines changes in accounting performance for 76 large
management buyouts of public companies between 1980 and 1986. He shows that in the three
years after the transaction operating income, cash flow and market value all increase. He argues
that these increases reflect the impact of improved incentives rather than layoffs. (Looking at
more recent deals on US public-to-private transactions, however, Guo et al. [2009] find only
weak evidence that gains in operating performance of bought-out firms exceed those of their
peers.)

Muscarella and Vetsuypens [1990] examine 72 “reverse LBOs” (RLBOs), that is,

companies taken private which went public once again. These firms experienced a dramatic
increase in profitability, which they argue is a reflection of cost reductions.
More recent studies have used large samples and a variety of performance measures to
more directly assess whether private equity makes a difference in the management of the firms in
which they invest. Bloom et al. [2009] survey over 4,000 firms in Asia, Europe and the US to
assess their management practices. They show that private equity-backed firms are on average
the best-managed ownership group in the sample, though they cannot rule out the possibility
these firms were better managed before the PE transaction. Davis et al. [2009] compare all USbased manufacturing establishments that received PE investments between 1980 and 2005 with

4

similar establishments that did not receive PE investments. 1 They show that private equitybacked firms experienced a substantial productivity growth advantage (about two percentage
points) in the two years following the transaction. About two-thirds of this differential is due to
improved productivity among continuing establishments of the firms. Cao and Lerner [2009]
examine the three- and five-year stock performance of 496 RLBOs between 1980 and 2002.
RLBOs appear to consistently outperform other IPOs and the stock market as a whole. Large
RLBOs that are backed by PE firms with more capital under management perform better, while
quick flips – when PE firms sell off an investment soon after acquisition – underperform.
These findings might suggest that we would see superior performance for PE firms,
regardless of the economic conditions. Moreover, if PE firms represent a significant fraction of
the activity in certain industries (and tabulations in several countries, including the US and UK,
suggest that this is the case), there may also be a positive effect at the industry level.
Investigating the industry level also allows us to capture the ‘contagion’ effects arising if
improvements in bought-out firms spur their competitors to improve. This effect is not captured
by studies focusing on the individual portfolio companies.
While there has been little systematic evidence regarding the deleterious effects of private
equity on firms and industries, critics have pointed to case studies that illustrate negative
consequences of transactions. For instance, Rasmussen [2008] points to the buyout of Britain’s
Automobile Association, which led to large-scale layoffs and service disruptions while
generating substantial profits for the transaction’s sponsor, Permira. The Service Employees
International Union has prepared a series of studies (for example, 2007, 2008) showing the
1

Establishments are specific factories, offices, retail outlets and other distinct physical locations
where business takes place.
5

deleterious effect that excessive leverage, cost-cutting and poor managerial decisions by PE
groups can have on firms and industries through case studies such as Hawaiian Telecom, Intelsat,
KB Toys and TDC. These cases suggest that the impact of private equity on industries may be
more negative than suggested by the previous studies.
B. The impact of economic cycles
Numerous practitioner accounts over the years have suggested that the PE industry is
highly cyclical, with periods of easy financing availability (often in response to the successes of
earlier transactions) leading to an acceleration of deal volume, greater use of leverage, higher
valuations, and ultimately more troubled investments (akin to the well-known ‘corn-hog cycle’
in agricultural economics).
This pattern is corroborated in several academic studies. Axelson et al. [2009] document
the cyclical use of leverage in buyouts. Using a sample of 1,157 transactions completed by major
groups worldwide between 1985 and 2008, they show that the level of leverage is driven by the
cost of debt, rather than the more industry- and firm-specific factors that affect leverage in
publicly traded firms. The availability of leverage is also strongly associated with higher
valuation levels. Kaplan and Stein [1993] documented that the 1980s buyout boom saw an
increase in valuations, reliance on public debt and incentive problems (for example, parties
cashing out at the time of transaction). Moreover, in the transactions done at the market peak, the
outcomes were disappointing: of the 66 largest buyouts completed between 1986 and 1988, 38%
experienced financial distress, which they define as default or an actual or attempted
restructuring of debt obligations due to difficulties in making payments. 27% actually did default
on debt repayments, often in conjunction with a Chapter 11 filing. Kaplan and Schoar [2005] and
6

other papers provide indirect supporting evidence, showing that the performance of funds is
negatively correlated with inflows into these funds. Private equity funds raised during periods of
high capital inflows – which are typically associated with market peaks – perform far worse than
their peers.
These findings corroborate the suggestions that availability of financing impacts booms
and busts in the PE market. If firms completing buyouts at market peaks employ leverage
excessively, we may expect industries with heavy buyout activity to experience more intense
subsequent downturns. Moreover, the effects of this overinvestment would be exacerbated if PE
investments drive rivals, not backed by private equity, to aggressively invest and leverage
themselves. Chevalier [1995] shows that in regions with supermarkets receiving PE investments,
rivals responded by adding and expanding stores.
An alternative perspective is suggested by some recent events in the PE industry, even
though it has not been articulated by economic theorists or explored empirically. This suggestion
is that private equity-backed firms may do better during downturns because their investors
constitute a concentrated shareholder base, which can continue to provide equity financing in a
way that might be difficult to arrange for other companies during downturns. To cite two recent
examples of ‘equity cures,’ Terra Firma made a number of investments in EMI, while Kraton
Polymers’ equity investors (Ripplewood and CCMP) did likewise during the recent recession. 2
This perspective would imply that private equity-backed companies may actually outperform
their peers during downturns, as they have access to equity financing that other firms did not

have. The presence of liquid PE funds as shareholders may lead to fewer failures in difficult
economic conditions.
A related argument, originally proposed by Jensen [1989], is that the high levels of debt
in PE transactions force firms to respond earlier and more forcefully to negative shocks to their
business. As a result, private equity-backed firms may be forced to adjust their operations more
rapidly at the beginning of an industry downturn, enabling them to better weather a recession.
Even if some private equity-backed firms eventually end up in financial distress, their underlying
operations may thus be in better shape than their peers. This facilitates an efficient restructuring
of their capital structure and lowers the deadweight costs on the economy. Consistent with this
argument, Andrade and Kaplan [1998] study 31 distressed leveraged buyouts from the 1980s that
subsequently became financially distressed, and found that the value of the firms post-distress
was slightly higher than the value before the buyout, suggesting that even the leveraged buyouts
that were hit most severely by adverse shocks added some economic value.
Finally, the structural differences between PE funds and other financial institutions may
make them less susceptible to industry shocks. A major source of concern for financial
institutions is the so-called ‘run on the bank’ phenomenon. Runs occur when holders of shortterm liabilities, for example, depositors or repo counterparties, simultaneously refuse to provide
additional financing and demand their money back. Other versions of this phenomenon arise
when companies simultaneously draw down lines of credit, hedge fund investors simultaneously
ask for redemptions of their investments, or a freeze in the market for commercial paper prevents
structured investment vehicles (SIVs) from rolling over short-term commercial paper. It is
unlikely that PE investments create dangers through this mechanism. Private equity funds are
8

typically prevented from borrowing themselves, and the funds’ only claimants are their limited
partners (LPs), which are typically bound by 10-year lock-up agreements. Hence, the funds have
no short-term creditors that can run. By way of contrast, extensive loans are provided to the
individual portfolio companies. However, these loans are typically made by a concentrated set of
lenders, and are without recourse to other portfolio companies or the fund generally. Hence, an
individual creditor’s ability to be repaid is largely unaffected by the actions of other creditors,
mitigating the incentive to run.
3. DATA SOURCES AND SAMPLE CONSTRUCTION
To analyze how PE investments affect industries, we combine two datasets, one
containing information about PE investments compiled by Capital IQ, and another with industry
activity and performance across the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) member countries included in the OECD’s Structural Analysis Database (STAN).
PE investment sample: We use the Capital IQ database to construct a base sample of PE
transactions. The base sample contains all private placements and M&A transactions in Capital
IQ where the list of acquirers includes (at least) one investment firm that has a reported
investment interest in one of the following stages: Seed/startup, Early venture, Emerging growth,
Growth capital, Bridge, Turnaround, Middle market, Mature, Buyout, Mid-venture, Late venture,
Industry consolidation, Mezzanine/subdebt, Incubation, Recapitalization, or PIPES.
From the base sample, we select all M&A transactions classified as ‘leveraged buyout,’
‘management buyout,’ or ‘going private’ that were announced between January 1986 and
December 2007 and where the target company is located in an OECD country included in the
9

STAN database. We exclude transactions that were announced but not yet completed as well as
transactions that did not involve a financial investor (for example, a buyout led and executed by
the management team itself was excluded).
This results in a sample of about 14,300 transactions, involving 13,100 distinct firms.
Since we only have information about the deal size for 50% of our transactions (though more of
the larger transactions), we impute missing deal sizes by constructing fitted values from a
regression of deal size on fixed effects for country, investment year and target industry. Using
the imputed transaction sizes, we generate aggregate country-year-industry measures of PE
volume in the form of summed deal sizes.
Industry data: The STAN database provides industry data across OECD countries
compiled from national statistics offices. It contains economic information at the country, year
and industry level. Thus, a typical observation would be the German transport equipment
industry in 1999. STAN includes measures of productivity, employment and capital formation,
as described in Table 1. Throughout this paper, we focus on the following measures of industry
activity:
•

Production (gross output), the value of goods and/or services produced in a year, whether
sold or stocked, in current prices.

•

Value added represents the industry’s contribution to national GDP, i.e. output net of
materials purchased. While the methodology for constructing this measure differs across
nations, our focus here is on differences across time, which should reduce the effect of
national differences in the measure.

10

•

Labor costs, which comprise wages and salaries of employees paid by producers as well
as supplements such as contributions to social security, private pensions, health
insurance, life insurance and similar schemes.

•

Number of employees, which is the traditional measure of employment, excluding selfemployed and unpaid family members working in the business.

•

Gross capital formation is acquisitions, less disposals, of new tangible assets, as well as
such intangible assets as mineral exploration and computer software. This variable is the
closest aggregate to capital expenditures. The two capital stock measures are indicators of
the value of all capital equipment held. The gross stock measure does not factor in
depreciation, while the net stock does reflect write-downs.

•

Consumption of fixed capital measures the reduction in the value of fixed assets used in
production resulting from physical deterioration or normal obsolescence.
Mapping Capital IQ and STAN industries: Industries in the STAN database are classified

by the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) code. To link these data to the
industry-aggregated PE activity, we matched the ISIC codes with Capital IQ’s industry
classifications. We used the existing mapping from Capital IQ industry classification into SIC
codes, and then used the existing matching between SIC and ISIC industries. The mapping of
Capital IQ industry classifications to SIC codes includes only matches for the most detailed
levels of the Capital IQ classifications. This poses a problem for more aggregated industries for
which Capital IQ does not provide a match to a SIC and ultimately to ISIC. When the Capital IQ
target industry is at a more aggregated industry level, we mapped all four-digit SIC codes that
belong to the sub-categories of the industry classification of Capital IQ. In these cases, we had
multiple four-digit SIC codes for a single Capital IQ industry. In some of the transactions all of
11

the four-digit SICs corresponded to the same ISIC industry classification, creating a one-to-one
mapping. In cases where the four-digit SIC codes corresponded to different industries in the ISIC
scheme, we considered the particular deals and selected the most suitable industry. In 390
transactions, we were not able to determine with certainty the appropriate match in ISIC, and
those transactions were dropped, leaving us with 13,910 PE transactions with ISIC
classifications. Finally, we grouped ISIC sub-industries to balance PE activity across industries.
Table 2 presents the distribution of deals across industries.
This results in a sample of 11,135 country-industry-year observations during the years
1986 to 2007. For each country, industry and year, we measure PE activity as the volume of PE
deals occurring in this country and industry during the previous five years. In particular, an
observation is a PE industry if it had at least one PE investment in one of those five years. (This
definition was motivated by holding periods reported by Strömberg [2008]).

With this

definition, we can only compare activity during 1991 to 2007, leaving us with 8,596 countryindustry-year observations.
Tables 2, 3 and 4 present the distribution of deals across industries, years and countries.
In each table, we first present the number of observations (an observation is a country-industryyear pair) and the number of those that were PE industries, as defined above. We then present
the number of deals, transaction volume and the transaction volume including the imputed sizes
of deals with missing information.
Several patterns are visible from Tables 2 through 4:

12

•

The heavy representation of buyouts as a share of economic activity in traditional
industries, such as ‘Textiles, textile products, leather,’ ‘Machinery and equipment,’ ‘Pulp,
paper, paper products, printing,’ ‘Electrical and optical equipment,’ and ‘Chemical,
rubber, plastics and fuel products’.

•

The acceleration in buyout activity, first modestly during the late 1980s and then
especially in the mid-2000s.

•

The greater level of activity in a handful of traditional hubs for PE funds, including the
United States, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. 3
In Table 5, we compare the changes in the industry measures over time for PE and non-

PE industries. The PE industries grow more quickly in terms of output and value added, as well
in terms of employment. But for gross fixed capital formation, the PE industries have a slower
growth rate.
4. ANALYSIS
A. Industry performance
We begin by examining the relationship between various industry characteristics and the
role of private equity in the industry. In each case, we use the industry-country-year as an
observation, and the explanatory variable is the relative growth rate along a given dimension (for
example, employment). This adjusted rate is computed by subtracting the growth rate
experienced in that industry, country and year from the average growth rate across countries in

The level of transactions is extremely high in Luxembourg, due to the tendency of many firms
to domicile there for tax reasons, even though the bulk of their operations are elsewhere. As a
result, we omit Luxembourg from the analyses below.

3

13

that same industry and year. Demeaning the growth rate in this way is largely equivalent to
including year-industry fixed effects, but it allows for an easier interpretation of the estimated
parameters.
We employ several specifications. First, we look at specifications that include controls
for each year, industry and country. For the exogenous variable, we include an indicator which
denotes whether the industry is a PE industry or not, using the definition above. This definition
does not use the imputed deal values, since it only depends on the presence of PE deals. Second,
we use two indicators to capture whether an industry is a low or high PE industry. A low PE
industry (PE Low) is a PE industry where the fraction of total imputed PE investments divided
by total production (both normalized to 2008 USD) is smaller than the median (conditional on
having a non-zero level of PE investment). Empirically, this median is 0.61%. Correspondingly,
a high PE industry (PE High) is one where the fraction is greater than 0.61%. We also perform
the analysis dividing PE activity into quartiles to better measure the differential effects of
different activity levels. Third, we include dummies that are interactions between countries and
industries (Co-Ind FE). These controls allow us to more precisely capture national differences in
the industry dynamics: if there is any effect from a PE investment, it is because the growth rate is
fast during that specific period.
The results in Table 6 indicate that industries with PE deals have significantly higher
growth rates of production and value added. For instance, in the first regression, the coefficient
of 0.906 implies that the total production of an average PE industry grows at an annual rate that
is 0.906% higher than a non-PE industry. (Table 5 reports that the mean growth rate is 5.9%.)
We report the significance of a statistical test for differences between high and low PE industries
14

and differences between the four quartiles of PE activity (all reported as PEL = PEH). We find
few differences in total production between high and low PE industries, although the
specification using quartiles suggests that the positive effect may be particularly strong for
industries with an intermediate level of PE activity. Value added for an industry appears to be
increasing in the amount of PE activity, with the differences between high and low PE industries
being statistically and economically significant.
One concern is the direction of causality. It is possible that PE investors pick industries
that are about to start growing and our results may reflect this industry choice rather than the
causal effect of the investments on the industry. To mitigate this concern, we change our
definition of the PE industry measure to only include investments during the period from two to
five years prior to the observation, called the twice-lagged measure (the original PE measure
included all five years prior to the observation). The results are reported in Table 7. We find that
the results are very similar, indicating that the effect that we find is unlikely to be driven by PE
investors entering countries and industries where they expect stronger immediate growth.
Table 8 considers measures of employment. PE industries appear to grow significantly
faster in terms of labor costs and the number of employees. The annual growth rate of total labor
cost is 0.5 to 1.4 percentage points greater for PE industries, and the number of employees grows
at an annual rate that is 0.4 to 1.0 percentage points greater. These findings are particularly
surprising, since a common concern is that PE investors act aggressively to reduce costs with
little concern for employees. This concern is not necessarily inconsistent with our results.
Despite initial employment reductions at private equity-backed firms, the greater subsequent
growth in total production, observed in Table 6, may lead to subsequent employment growth in
15

the industry overall. Considering the specifications with PE activity quartiles, industries with
more PE activity appear to have more rapid growth of total labor costs, but the growth rate of the
number of employees is fastest in industries with more moderate levels of PE activity.
Regardless of the level of PE activity, however, the PE industries’ growth rates of labor costs and
employment always exceed the rates for non-PE industries.
As above, we are concerned about the direction of causality, and Table 9 repeats the
analysis using the twice-lagged PE measure. The magnitudes in Tables 8 and 9 are largely
similar, suggesting that the effect we find is not mainly driven by PE investors picking industries
with expectations of immediate employment growth.
Finally, in Table 10 we examine measures of fixed capital formation and consumption of
fixed capital. These measures appear much more volatile than the production and employment
measures, making it difficult to discern any relationship between PE investments and capital
formation.
B. Cyclical patterns
We next turn to analyzing how private equity relates to industry cycles. For each industry
and year, we calculate the average growth by averaging the growth rate of the productivity and
employment measures across countries. This measures the annual aggregate shock in these
variables (for example, production output in the steel industry fell by 2% on average in 2002
across the nations in our sample). We then investigate whether PE industries are more or less
exposed to this shock by including the PE measure interacted with this average growth measure
in the regressions. If PE industries are more sensitive to economic conditions, the coefficient on
16

the interaction term is positive: during upturns, these industries grow faster and during
downturns they decline faster. A negative coefficient indicates a lower exposure to the aggregate
shock than industries without PE investments. Once again, we use country and industry fixed
effects, as well as country-industry fixed effect interactions.
In Tables 11 and 12, we examine the impact on production and employment. In the first
table, the interaction terms are negative, which implies that PE industries are less sensitive to
industry shocks. To interpret the coefficients, using the estimates in the first regression in Table
12, if an industry on average experiences a 5% increase in total labor costs in a given year (the
aggregate shock), a PE industry will experience, on average, a 5.576% increase (5% + 1.591% +
5% x -0.203 = 5.576%). Conversely, following a 5% decrease in the wage bill, a PE industry will
only experience, on average, a 2.394% decline (–5% + 1.591% + (–5%) x –0.203 = –2.394%).
Hence, an aggregate swing from +5% to –5% (10% total difference) in aggregate growth rates
translates into a swing from 5.6% to –2.4% (8% total difference) in the growth rates for PE
industries. Both for the productivity and employment analyses, the coefficients are significantly
negative in the simple specification and most of the coefficients in the employment analysis
remain statistically significant when high and low PE industries are included separately. Overall,
it appears that some PE activity translates into an industry whose employment changes less than
average, but industries with a larger amount of PE activity may follow a growth pattern that is
closer to that of the industry as a whole.
C. Geographic patterns
One concern is that the impact of private equity is different in continental Europe than in
the United States and United Kingdom. Not only is the level of PE activity higher in the US and
17

UK than in most other nations, but the industry is more established, having begun in these two
nations. We thus repeat the analysis, looking at US and UK versus Continental Europe
(investments in Japan and South Korea are excluded from these analyses).
We report the results in Tables 13 and 14, which repeat the base specifications reported in
Tables 6 and 8. All the main effects remain largely unchanged for the Continental Europe
sample. The coefficients in the US and UK sample are generally not statistically significant but
they are not statistically different from the coefficients for the Continental Europe sample either.
This probably reflects the small size of the US and UK sample and the resulting large standard
errors: for productivity, value added and labor costs the coefficients are smaller than in
Continental Europe; for total employment the coefficient is larger.
D. Addressing causality concerns
One natural concern relates to the interpretation of these results. While it appears that
private equity is associated with more rapid growth at an industry level in our analyses, it is
natural to wonder which way the causation runs. Does the presence of private equity lead to
better performance, or do PE investors invest where they (correctly) anticipate industries will
grow?
We respond to this question in several ways. First, we look at PE investments during the
five years before the measured growth. Second, as discussed above, we have also narrowed our
measure to only include deals in the second through fifth year prior to the investment. If our
effects are due to PE investors anticipating growth, they would have to be quite prescient.

18

In subsequent versions of this paper, we will also attempt to address this concern using an
instrumental variables technique. To identify exogenous variation, we may use the size of the
private pension pool in the nation and year, expressed as a percentage of GDP. This is similar in
spirit to other papers in the venture capital literature, such as Kortum and Lerner [2000] and
Mollica and Zingales [2007]. In the nations with larger pension pools, domestic PE funds are
more likely to raise capital and invest it locally. This is an attractive instrumental variable,
because pension policy is typically driven by broader socio-economic considerations, and not by
the relative health of the local PE industry.
5. CONCLUSIONS
The growth of the PE industry has spurred concerns about its potential impact on the
economy more generally. In this analysis, we look across nations and industries to assess the
impact of private equity on industry performance.
The key results are, first, that industries where PE funds have invested in the past five
years have grown more quickly, using a variety of measures. There are few significant
differences between industries with limited and high PE activity. Second, it is hard to find
support for claims that economic activity in industries with PE backing is more exposed to
aggregate shocks. The results using lagged PE investments suggest that the results are not driven
by reverse causality. Finally, these patterns are not driven solely by common law nations such as
the United Kingdom and United States, but also hold in Continental Europe.
These findings suggest a number of avenues for future research. First, it would be
interesting to look at finer data on certain critical aspects of industry performance, such as the
19

rates of layoffs, plant closings and openings, and product and process innovations. Second, it is
important to better understand the mechanisms by which the presence of private equity-backed
firms affects their peers. While Chevalier’s [1995] study of the supermarket industry during the
1980s was an important first step, much more remains to be explored here. Finally, we are only
able to look backwards in this analysis. The buyout boom of the mid 2000s was so massive, and
the subsequent crash in activity so dramatic, that the consequences may have been substantially
different from other economic cycles (see Kosman [2009]). The impact of the recent cycle will
be an important issue to explore in the years to come.

pair. The endogenous variable is the deviation of the annual growth rate of production or value added (as defined by OECD) relative to the average
rate in the same industry and year. The exogenous variables are an indicator for positive PE activity over the previous five years at the countryindustry level (PE), indicators for whether the measured PE activity is below or above the median activity level (PE Low and PE High), and
indicators for quartiles. The omitted base category is no PE activity over the previous five years. The regressions contain industry, country, and
country-industry (Co-Ind) fixed effects as indicated. Standard errors are calculated with clustering at the country-year level and presented in
parenthesis. PEL = PEH contains the significance level of a Wald test of equality of the PE Low and PE High coefficients or the quartile

Table 8: PE activity and growth rate of employment The table contains OLS regression coefficients. An observation is a country-industry-year
pair. The endogenous variable is the deviation of the annual growth rate of labor costs or total employment (as defined by OECD) relative to the
average rate in the same industry and year. The exogenous variables are an indicator for positive PE activity over the previous five years at the
country-industry level (PE), indicators for whether the measured PE activity is below or above the median activity level (PE Low and PE High)
and indicators for quartiles. The omitted base category is no PE activity over the previous five years. The regressions contain industry, country and
country-industry (Co-Ind) fixed effects as indicated. Standard errors are calculated with clustering at the country-year level and presented in
parenthesis. PEL = PEH contains the significance level of a Wald test of equality of the PE Low and PE High coefficients or the quartile
coefficients. Statistical significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels are indicated by ***, ** and *, respectively.
