ABSTRACT
We combine data on individual trade transactions from U.S. customs records with comprehensive
information on firms' employment from the Census Bureau's business register to examine wholesalers
and retailers in U.S. exports and imports. Exporters and importers with 100 percent employment in
wholesale and retail differ from pure "producer and consumer" trading firms along a number of dimensions:
they are smaller in terms of employment, trade value and domestic sales, operate fewer U.S. establishments
and are present in fewer U.S. states. "Mixed" firms, i.e., those with both production/consumption and
wholesale retail within the boundaries of the firm, on the other hand, are substantially larger. They
trade more products, trade with more countries, and are more likely to engage in related-party trade.

Wholesalers and Retailers in U.S. Trade
(Long Version)
By A NDREW B. B ERNARD , J. B RADFORD J ENSEN , S TEPHEN J. R EDDING AND P ETER K.
S CHOTT

International trade models typically assume that
producers in one country trade directly with final consumers in another. In the real world, of course, trade
can involve long chains of potentially independent actors who move goods through wholesale and retail
distribution networks. These networks likely affect
the magnitude and nature of trade frictions and hence
both the pattern of trade and its welfare gains. To
promote further understanding of the means by which
goods move across borders, this paper examines the
extent to which U.S. exports and imports flow through
wholesalers and retailers versus “producing and consuming” firms. We highlight a number of stylized
facts about these intermediaries, and show that their
attributes can deviate substantially from the portrait
of trading firms that has emerged from microdata in
recent years.
We combine data on individual trade transactions
from U.S. customs records with comprehensive information on firms’ employment from the Census Bureau’s business register. We define “pure” wholesalers

and retailers to be importers or exporters with 100 percent of their U.S. employment in either of those two
sectors. These firms account for large shares of exporters and importers but relatively little export and
import value. We define “pure” producing and consuming firms to be those with zero employment in
wholesaling and retailing. These firms – arguably
the closest analog to the hypothetical “trading firm”
in much of the heterogeneous-firm literature in international trade – account for relatively large shares of
firms but moderate amounts of value. The remaining
“mixed” firms are the rarest but by far the largest in
terms of value. Distinguishing between “mixed” firms
that have more and less than three quarters of their
employment in wholesaling plus retailing, we find the
latter dominate.
Pure wholesalers and retailers differ from pure producer and consumer firms along a number of dimensions: they are smaller in terms of employment,
trade value and domestic sales, operate fewer U.S.
establishments and are present in fewer U.S. states.
“Mixed” firms, on the other hand, are substantially
larger. They trade more products, trade with more
countries, and are more likely to engage in relatedparty trade.
Intermediaries’ existence indicates that they overcome barriers to international trade at lower cost than
at least some producer and consumer firms. As a
result, we examine whether the scope and intensity
of wholesale and retail trade varies with product and
country characteristics related to these costs as well
as foreign demand.1 We find participation in productcountry markets to be well below one hundred percent
for all types of firms, and especially low for pure retailers and mixed-wholesaler-retailers. This variation

in participation appears related to product and country attributes. Wholesalers’ trade is disproportionately
concentrated in agriculture-related sectors and is relatively less sensitive to market size than other types of
firms’ trade, with the result that wholesalers have relatively greater penetration of small markets than the
other types of firms. Retailers and mixed wholesalerretailers’ trade, on the other hand, is relatively insensitive to distance, likely due to their concentration in
consumer goods such as clothing and footwear that
are sourced disproportionately from far-away China.
II. Data
Our results focus on 2002 but we note that results for other years are similar. We use the U.S.
Linked/Longitudinal Firm Trade Transaction Database (LFTTD), which matches individual U.S. trade
transactions to U.S. firms in the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD).2 For each export and import
transaction, we observe the U.S.-based firm engaging
in the transaction, the ten-digit Harmonized System
(HS) classification of the product shipped, the (nominal) value shipped, the shipment date, the destination
or source country, and whether the transaction takes
place at “arm’s length” or between “related parties”.3
For importers, we also observe an identifier for the
manufacturer or shipper from which the import was
received, and we use this field to identify each importer’s number of foreign “partner firms”. Via the
LBD, we observe firms’ employment according to
the major-industry of each of its establishments (i.e.,
plants). This information allows us to compute the
share of firms’ U.S. employment across nine broad
sectors, including wholesale and retail (NAICS sectors 42 and 44 to 45, respectively). Firms with only
a single establishment in the United States necessarily have 100 percent of their employment in a single
sector.
Table 1 reports weighted average employment
shares across sectors for several types of exporters and
importers defined below, where firms’ employment
shares are weighted by their share of export and import value respectively. The first column of each panel
reports results for all trading firms appearing in our
data. We find that wholesale and retail employment
generally is higher among importers than exporters.
2 We link 80 percent of transactions by value; see Andrew

B. Bernard, J. Bradford Jensen and Peter K. Schott (2009) for
more details.
3 Ownership thresholds for relatedness are 10 percent
(exports) and 6 percent (imports).

MONTH YEAR

On average importers have 27 percent of their employment in wholesale and 7 percent in retail, which
compares with 18 percent and 2 percent respectively
for exporters. Outside of wholesaling and retailing,
manufacturing is the dominant employment category,
more so for exporters than for importers. Service sector employment, on the other hand, is higher among
importers, particularly PC firms (defined below).
Among trading firms, we consider two categories
of “pure” intermediaries: pure wholesalers (W), who
have 100 percent of their U.S. employment in wholesaling, and pure retailers (R) who have 100 percent of
their U.S. employment in retailing.4 We compare W
and R to two other types of firms: “pure” producers or
consumers (PC), which have zero wholesale and retail
employment, and “mixed” firms, which have wholesale plus retail employment between 0 and 100 percent. To explore the ramifications of using a sharp
100 percent cutoff in defining W and R firms, we further divide mixed firms into “mixed wholesale-retail”
(MWR) and “mixed producer-consumer” (MPC) according to whether wholesaling plus retailing accounts for more or less than 75 percent of employment.5 As indicated in Table 1, MPC firms have their
employment disproportionately concentrated in manufacturing. The non-wholesale-retail employment of
MWR firms, in contrast, is tilted towards services.
Together, W, R, PC, MWR and MPC firms are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. Unfortunately, we
cannot compare firms in the LFTTD to those which
trade “indirectly” via wholesalers or retailers as we
do not observe the latter’s sales or purchases within
the United States.
Table 2 reports the share of each type of firm
among exporters and importers in 2002, as well as the
share of total U.S. exports and imports for which they
are responsible. Collectively, pure wholesalers and retailers account for large shares of trading firms but relatively little value, with wholesalers being four to five
times more prevalent and responsible for considerably
more trade. PC firms are most numerous on the export side and as numerous as Ws on the import side,
and represent roughly one fifth each of export and import value. Mixed firms are rarest but account for the
4 Most – but not all – of the “pure” firms are singleestablishment firms. Firms with employment split between
wholesale and retail are allocated to W or R according to
whichever is higher.
5 MWR firms typically have only wholesale (most common) or only retail employment.

majority of U.S. trade; this dominance is stronger for
exports than imports, though MWR importers are relatively more important for imports than for exports.
The country composition of trade also differs substantially across firm types and between exports and imports, with W, R and MWR importers having by far
the largest shares of trade with China.6
III. Wholesaler and Retailer “Premia”
It is well known that trading firms differ from
purely domestic firms along a number of dimensions
(e.g., Bernard et al. 2007). Here, we demonstrate substantial heterogeneity within trading firms.
Table 3 reports non-PC firms’ “premia” relative to
PC firms in 2002. Each cell reports the result of a different firm- (top panel) or firm-product-country- (bottom panel) level OLS regression of the noted characteristic on a dummy variable for the noted firm type.
Each regression sample includes all firms of the noted
type as well as PC firms. Regressions in the top panel
include firm major six-digit HS category fixed effects
as well as controls for firm employment deciles (except in the first row). Regressions summarized in
the bottom panel include product-country fixed effects
and also use employment-decile dummies to control
for firm size.
Firm-level attributes considered in the top panel
of Table 3 include domestic employment, total trade
value and total domestic sales (from across all economic censuses in which the firm is present), the
number of country partners, the number of products
traded, the value-weighted mean per capita GDP of
firms’ country destinations or sources, the number of
foreign partner firms (imports only), the number of
U.S. establishments and the number of U.S. states in
which the firm has an establishment.7 Firm-productcountry attributes considered in the bottom panel of
the figure include: trade value; overall, arm’s-length
and related-party unit values (i.e., value divided by
quantity); and related-party share (i.e., value with
related-parties divided by total value).
Relative to PC firms, W and R exporters and
importers have lower employment and, within size
deciles, have lower domestic sales, operate fewer establishments, operate in fewer states and trade more
6 See Emek Basker and Pham Hoang Van (2008a,b) for
further evidence of the contribution of retailers to import
growth from China.

60 percent (1  e091 ) of the employment of PC firms.

products per country.8 MWR exporters and importers,
in contrast, are substantially larger than PC firms: they
trade more products, trade with more countries, trade
more products per country and, on the import side, interact with more foreign partner firms, though only W
importers trade with more foreign partners per product per country than PC firms. MPC firms are also
relatively large; they trade significantly more value at
the product-country level than PC firms and are substantially more likely to engage in trade with related
parties. W, R and MWR importers all trade with countries with a lower average GDP per capita than PC
firms.
Results with respect to unit values are less clear.
Perhaps intuitively, W, R and MWR exporters have
relatively low unit values within product-country cells
and firm size deciles than either MPC or PC firms. On
the other hand, while W and MWR importers have
relatively low unit values, we find that R importers
have relatively high unit values.
A final comparison of firm types, in Table 8, relates to the concentration of trade. We find W, R and
MWR trade to be less concentrated among large firms
than PC and MPC trade. While the top one (five) percent of W exporters and importers account for 0.47
(0.73) and 0.41 (0.67) of W exports and imports, respectively, the top one (five) percent of PC firms account for 0.60 (0.83) and 0.77 (0.90) of PC exports
and imports, respectively. R and MWR firms are similarly less concentrated, while MPC firms are similarly
concentrated. These results indicate that the extreme
concentration of trade observed in microdata in recent
years is driven by PC and MPC firms.
IV. Product-Country Determinants of Intermediation
The third column of each panel in Table 2 reveals
that R and MWR firms participate in far lower shares
of product-country markets than W, PC and MPC
firms.9 Even among the latter, however, participation
is well below 100 percent. In this section, we examine
the product and country characteristics that influence
the markets in which each type of trading firm participates.
The left and right panels of Table 4 report correlations across products of the share of trade value ac8 Manipulation of the coefficients in Table 3 allows com-

parison of products per country and, on the import side, foreign firms per product per country.
9 The denominator of these shares is the total number of
product-country cells in which the United States is present.

counted for by each type of exporter and importer in
2002, respectively. Two trends stand out. First, intermediaries’ correlations with non-intermediaries are
negative for both exporters and importers, indicating
these firms’ specialize in different sets of goods. Second, the shares of PC and MPC firms are also negatively correlated. This result suggests producer and
consumer firms may develop in-house wholesaling or
retailing capabilities depending on the products they
produce, or vice versa.
Table 5 reports the distribution of export and import
value across firm types for aggregations of two-digit
HS categories. As indicated in the table, Ws tend to
concentrate in agriculture-related sectors such as Animal and Vegetable products in both exports and imports. PC and MPCs, on the other hand, focus more on
industries more likely to contain differentiated goods,
such as Transportation. Among importers, we find
that MWRs are disproportionately active in Textiles,
Clothing and Footwear.
We also find a positive and statistically significant
correlation across products between the trade value
shares of exporters versus importers of each firm type.
This correlation exists both across the two-digit HS
categories reported in Table 5 and across six-digit HS
categories (see the diagonal of Table 6), which are
the most detailed level at which export and import HS
codes can be compared. The fact that importers and
exporters of a given firm type participate in similar
products suggests the importance of product attributes
in driving intermediation.
Evidence on the country characteristics influencing
trade participation is reported in Table 7, which displays the distribution of U.S. trade by type of firm in
2002 according to destination- or source-country GDP
quintile. As indicated in the table, the share of exports
(imports) mediated by pure wholesalers declines with
market size, from 0.20 (0.25) for the smallest quintile
of destination (source) markets to 0.07 (0.14) for the
largest. For MPC exporters and importers, we find the
opposite trend, i.e., an increase in the share of trade
from these firms as market size grows. Patterns for
PC firms are less regular, but for both exports and imports, shares decline with market size after the first
quintile. We explore these relationships further in the
context of “gravity” in the next section.
V. Gravity
A long line of research in international trade highlights the importance of “gravity” in determining
trade flows. Here, we examine the influence of gravity
for different types of trading firms.

MONTH YEAR

Table 9 reports the results of three, country-level
OLS regressions. In the top panel, log aggregate trade
value is regressed on partner countries’ log GDP and
log great-circle distance from the United States (in
km).10 In the second and third panels, the extensive and intensive components of log value, i.e., the
log number of firm-product observations with positive trade and the log average value per firm-product
observation with positive trade, are regressed on these
variables. As these components sum to log aggregate
value, the coefficients reported in the second and third
panels sum to their respective coefficients reported in
the first panel.
Results for exports are straightforward: trade value
falls with distance and rises with market size. Moreover, gravity’s stronger effect on extensive versus intensive margins across the board is consistent with
recent research on the margins of trade (Bernard et
al. 2007, 2009). Comparing the coefficient on GDP
across columns, we find W trade is less sensitive to
market size than MPC trade, consistent with the former’s declining market share across GDP quintiles
noted above. This differential response is disproportionately due to the intensive margin. As indicated in
the bottom panel, coefficients on log GDP are relatively larger for MWR and MPC versus other types of
firms than in the middle panel.
Results for imports are less conventional. While we
find the expected positive relationship between market
size and import value across the three panels, distance
has a negative and statistically significant relationship
with import value only for PC and MPC firms. For
intermediaries, the relationship is negative but statistically insignificant for Ws and positive but statistically insignificant for Rs and MWRs. One factor contributing to this result is the above-noted relatively
heavy concentration of retailers and mixed wholesaleretailers in consumer goods such as textiles, clothing and footwear that are disproportionately imported
from far-away China. As indicated in the final column of Table 2, a relatively large share of W, R and
MWR firms’ import value originates in China.11 Indeed, R and MWR importers’ value shares across the
10 These data are from the World Bank and CEPII, respectively. The mean (standard deviation) of these variables are
25 (2) and 8 (0.7), respectively.
11 A similar trend is noted with respect low-wage countries more generally, e.g., those with less than 5 or 10 percent of U.S. per capita GDP as in Schott (2003). As noted in
Table 3, W, R and MWR firms tend to import from countries
with lower per-capita GDP than PC and MPC firms.

industries in Table 5 are strongly positively correlated
with China’s import market shares in those industries.
Analogous correlations with respect to PC and MPC
firms’ shares are negative but statistically insignificant.12
VI. Conclusions
Trading firms exhibit substantial heterogeneity and
can be quite different from the “stylized” trading firm
emphasized in much of the recent literature in international trade. While pure wholesalers are relatively numerous, they are on average smaller than pure producers, and account for a relatively small share of trade
value. While pure wholesalers are concentrated in
agriculture-related sectors, pure producers and mixed
firms are more prevalent in industries more likely to
contain differentiated goods such as transportation.
Pure wholesalers are relatively less sensitive to market size and import disproportionately from China and
other low-wage countries. Together with differences
in product specialization, this leads to departures on
the import side from the standard gravity equation
predictions for trade.

Notes: Each cell reports the results of a different firm OLS regression of noted characteristic on a dummy
variable for noted firm type versus PC firms. Top- (bottom-) panel regressions include major six-digit HS
category (product-country) fixed effects. All regressions except those in first row control for firm size (see text).
Robust standard errors clustered according to the fixed effects are reported below coefficients. ***, ** and *
denote statistical significance at the 1, 5 and 10 percent levels. Data are for 2002.
