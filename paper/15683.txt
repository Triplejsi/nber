Educational Expectations and Attainment

NBER Working Paper No. 15683

JEL No. I20,J01,J24
ABSTRACT
This paper examines the role of educational expectations in the educational attainment process. We
utilize data from a variety of datasets to document and analyze the trends in educational expectations
between the mid-1970s and the early 2000s. We focus on differences across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic
groups and examine how young people update their expectations during high school and beyond.
The results indicate that expectations rose for all students with the greatest increases among young
women. Expectations have become somewhat less predictive of attainment over the past several decades
but expectations remain strong predictors of attainment above and beyond other standard determinants
of schooling. Interestingly, the data demonstrate that the majority (about 60 percent) of students update
their expectations at least once between eighth grade and eight years post-high school. Updating appears
to be based, in part, on the acquisition of new information about academic ability.

I. Introduction
Education has become an increasingly important determinant of labor market success in
the United States over the past several decades. The economic returns to a college degree have
jumped dramatically. For example, the weekly earnings of workers with exactly a bachelor’s
degree increased by roughly 22 percent from 1980 to 2005 relative to workers with a high school
diploma alone (Goldin and Katz 2007). At the same time, rates of college completion have
increased across all racial/ethnic and socio-economic groups during this period. Yet,
economically disadvantaged groups still lag behind their more advantaged peers in terms of
educational attainment. According to the U.S. Census, 37 percent of white, non-Hispanic twentyfive to twenty-nine year olds had at least a Bachelor’s degree in 2008 compared with only 21 and
12 percent of African-American and Hispanics respectively (U.S. Census, 2008).
Researchers, educators and policymakers have frequently looked to the educational
expectations of young people – that is, their beliefs about their likely educational attainment - to
gauge their future success. During the 1960s, William H. Sewell and Otis D. Duncan and their
colleagues produced seminal research demonstrating a strong positive correlation between
expectations and educational and occupational attainment. This research spurred almost fifty
years of inquiry into the effects of expectations on attainment. While there is no convincing
evidence that expectations influence attainment in a causal sense, many still believe that
inspiring students to attend college will result in a more highly educated population.
In this paper, we examine the role of educational expectations in the educational
attainment process. Specifically, we investigate how the family experience, school functioning,
and knowledge of the labor market pathways affect educational outcomes by means of
expectations. We begin by documenting the trends in educational expectations between 1980 and

the early 2000s, highlighting how these trends have changed differentially across racial/ethnic
and socioeconomic groups. While there is a considerable literature on expectations in the 1980s
and 1990s, 1 there is very little evidence on how expectations have evolved over the past fifteen
years, arguably a period during which educational attainment has become even more important
for disadvantaged youth.
To document these trends, we combine data from three longitudinal NCES datasets: High
School and Beyond Survey (HSB), the National Education Longitudinal Survey of 1988 (NELS),
and the Education Longitudinal Survey of 2002 (ELS). In addition, we use data from
Monitoring the Future (MTF), a rich source of information on a nationally representative set of
high school students beginning in the mid-1970s that has never (to the best of our knowledge)
been used for this purpose. Our trend analysis pays particular attention to the gap between
expectations and actual attainment.
Next, we examine how expectations are related to attainment. Earlier research
documents that conditional on a number of family, neighborhood, individual and school
characteristics higher expectations are associated with higher attainment. However, the growing
gap between expectations and actual attainment suggests that this relationship has weakened over
time. Our analysis focuses on how the relationship between expectations and attainment has
changed over time for various groups.
We will examine how, if at all, students update their expectations in response to
additional information about costs and benefits of college for themselves. Prior work has
documented this updating among college students (Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner 2009), but
there is no evidence on whether or not high school students or young adults in the labor force

update their educational expectations. Understanding the process by which students form
expectations and how they update these expectations is critical to understanding variation in
educational attainment. We use data on a nationally representative set of eighth grade students in
1988 from the NELS to explore how young people update their expectations during high school
and to determine if schools and college costs affect students’ development and maintenance of
expectations.
The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section II, we lay out the conceptual
framework for how expectations affect attainment. In Section III, we describe the data used in
our analysis. In Section IV, we document the trends in educational expectations and actual
attainment from the late 1970s through the early 2000s, highlighting differences across
racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups. In Section V, we analyze the relationship between
expectations and attainment. In Section VI, we develop a measure of the alignment between
expectations and predicted attainment and investigate the determinants of misalignment in high
school. Delving into the black box of expectations in Section VII, we document if and when
students update their expectations and analyze how schools and state higher education policy can
influence students’ expectations. Section VIII discusses the implications of our findings and
concludes.
II. Conceptual Framework
Since the 1970s much research has focused on the link between educational expectations
and educational attainment, with a focus on determining what factors influence the development
of educational expectations. Much of the early literature in this area uses the terms expectations
and aspirations interchangeably. In practice, however, these two concepts are quite distinct.
Expectations refer to what individuals think will happen while aspirations refer to what they hope

3

will happen. In this paper, we focus on expectations for several reasons. First, historically
aspirations are higher than expectations, perhaps because they are more heavily influenced by
societal norms, but given today’s mantra of college for all, aspirations and expectations are
indistinguishable. According to Monitoring the Future data, for example, 85.1 percent of the
Class of 2007 aspired to attain a BA or more and 84.8 percent of the Class of 2007 expected at
least a BA. Second, and related, expectations should be more amenable to rational updating
based upon the acquisition of new information than aspirations. In this sense, expectations are
the more appropriate target of social policies designed to increase educational attainment among
young people.
The vast majority of this research was conducted by sociologists and psychologists, who
view expectations formation as a social process whereby individuals draw on the experiences
and expectations of those around them. Figure 1 displays the potentially complex relationship
between expectations and attainment.
The squares and rectangles on the left side of the figure contain the determinants of
educational expectations. Solid lines indicate relationships we hypothesize are unidirectional
whereas dashed lines indicate potentially bi-directional relationship. Some of the determinants
such as family factors and college costs are exogenous to the individual. Other factors such as an
individual’s academic achievement and the attitudes/behaviors of one’s peers can vary with time,
and are likely both influence and are influenced by one’s own expectations. For example, family
SES affects a student’s expectations, but the student’s expectations are not likely to influence her
family’s SES. However, the high school program a student is placed in affects her expectations,
but her expectations may also affect the program in which the guidance counselor/administrator
places the student.

4

Many of the factors that affect expectations are also determinants of attainment, seen by
the curved arrows. Because expectations and attainment share many determinants, it is difficult
to untangle the effect of expectations on attainment. It may be that any relationship between
expectations and attainment is merely correlational, and the expectations merely mediate the
relationship between various individual, family, neighborhood, schools and cost factors and
attainment.
Yet, a substantial body of literature leads one to believe that arrow between expectations
and attainment does exist. There are a variety of mechanisms through which expectations might
influence attainment. For example, a student who expects to attend college may make a point of
signing up for college entrance exams and/or researching financial aid options. Similarly, upon
entering high school a student with college expectations may be placed in the college-prep high
school program as opposed to the general program. These mechanisms are shown as dotted
arrows in Figure 1. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationships outlined in
Figure 1 to better understand the how expectations might influence educational attainment.
III. Data
The analysis in this paper draws on several different data sets. To provide a consistent
picture of educational expectations over a long-time period, we utilize data from the Monitoring
the Future Survey (MTF). Funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and conducted at the
University of Michigan’s Survey Research Center, MTF collects data on student attitudes,
behaviors, and beliefs. Beginning in 1976, MTF has collected data annually on a national
representative sample of twelfth graders, which has consistently asked twelfth grade students
about their educational expectations. MTF began surveying eighth and tenth graders in 1991,
asking them similar questions.

5

In order to more carefully investigate the determinants of educational expectations, we
utilize data from a series of three longitudinal surveys conducted by the National Center for
Education Statistics: High School and Beyond, 1980 (HSB); the National Educational
Longitudinal Survey, 1988 (NELS); and the Education Longitudinal Survey, 2002 (ELS). These
surveys are longitudinal, following the high school sophomore classes of 1980, 1990, and 2002
into adulthood, thus documenting changes in expectations over time.
Each NCES survey follows students from the beginning of high school through entry into
their young adult lives. Included in each survey are data gathered from students and their parents,
teachers and schools, and administrative data such as high school transcripts. Because the goal
of each survey is similar—to monitor students’ academic experiences and educational and
occupational expectations to better understand the transition from high school to young adult
life—the questions pertaining to educational expectations are consistently asked throughout each
survey. Although previous research has utilized both HSB and the NELS to investigate
educational expectations, no research to date links these two surveys to the most current data
from the ELS. This is our contribution to the literature.
In addition to information on individual, family and school characteristics, these datasets
include demographic and local labor market data from the U.S. Census that is matched to the
respondent’s county of residence in the corresponding censual year. 2 Finally, in order to
measure the cost of postsecondary education for each respondent, we created county-level
measures of tuition and room and board costs at all degree-granting Title IV institutions using

2

In HSB, Census data was matched by NCES to the county in which the student’s tenth grade high school is located,
in the NELS the Census data was matched to student’s twelfth grade high school, and in the ELS the Census data is
matched to the county in which the student’s tenth grade high school is located. HSB incorporates data from the
1980 Census, NELS incorporates 1990 Census data and ELS incorporates 2000 Census data.

6

HEGIS/IPEDS data. In our analysis, we utilize the average in-state tuition and room and board
data in $2007. 3
In order to compare trends across all three files, in one of our analysis files we focus
solely on the set of students from tenth grade through two years following expected high school
graduation. In all three datasets, this entails tracking a nationally representative set of tenth
graders for 4 years, even if they leave school. To facilitate our analysis, we exclude students
who were missing data on tenth grade expectations or several key demographic variables such as
race, gender, socio-economic status and test scores. This results in dropping 15 percent of
students in HSB, 18 percent of students in NELS and 13 percent of students in ELS.
Table 1 presents the summary statistics from this three-cohort analysis sample. Several
facts are worth noting. First, there is a sharp increase in the expectations for at least some
college between 1980 and 1990, but little change from 1990 to 2002. In contrast, expectations
regarding BA completion jumped considerably in all periods. Second, parental education of
students increased over this period, particularly from 1980 to 1990. Last, the percent of students
enrolling in 4-year post-secondary institutions increased by nearly 50 percent between 1980 and
2002.
In addition to the three-cohort panel, we also utilize the full NELS panel to more
carefully examine how students update their expectations. This panel tracks a nationally
representative set of eighth graders in 1988 for twelve years, with the final survey administered
in 2000, when this cohort was eight years beyond their expected high school graduation date.
Table 2 presents summary statistics for this sample. It is worth noting that the sample size varies
across waves and outcomes as not all respondents have data for each variable in each wave.

7

IV. Trends in Educational Expectations
To begin, we present data on how educational expectations have evolved over the past
several decades. As noted above, most prior research has utilized survey data from high school
students in the early 1980s (HSB) and early 1990s (NELS). In Figure 2, we present similar data
on educational expectations from the Monitoring the Future (MTF) survey, which has regularly
surveyed nationally representative cohorts of students since 1976. This data not only allows us
to extend our analysis beyond the scope of HSB and NELS, but also provides a useful crosscheck on the reliability expectations data. To minimize the impact of sampling variability, we
present three-year moving averages.
In the top panel, we see that in 1976, roughly 77 percent of high school seniors expected
to complete at least some college. This fraction rose dramatically until the late 1990s, at which
point about 93 percent of seniors expected to complete at least some college. Comparing the
trends for eighth and tenth graders with those for twelfth graders, we see that on average,
students’ expectations with respect to some college did not change during high school.
In the bottom panel, we see a similar pattern for the fraction of high school seniors
expecting to complete at least a BA degree. Expectations increased rapidly from the 1970s
through the mid-1990s, and somewhat less rapidly (but nonetheless steadily) from the mid-1990s
through the present. At the same time, we see that on average students lower their expectations
between eighth and twelfth grade. Among the class of 2006, for example, roughly 90 percent of
students believed as eighth graders that they would complete a BA. But by the time that this
cohort had reached twelfth grade, only a little more than 80 percent expected to attain a BA.
Comparing these trends to the statistics shown in Table 1, there appears to be a relatively
good correspondence between the various data sets. Roughly 80 percent of the HSB cohort

8

believed that they would attain at least some college compared with about 85 percent in MTF,
but only 40 percent believed that they would attain a BA (compared with 58 percent in MTF).
Among the ELS cohort, who were seniors in 2004, 94 percent expected at least some college and
75 percent expected a BA (compared with about 95 percent and 80 percent in the MTF data).
Figures 3 and 4 show comparable trends for several different subgroups, focusing on
twelfth graders. Figures 3a and 3b show trends by race and gender. Black females had
noticeably higher expectations than all other groups at the beginning of the sample period (the
late 1970s and early 1980s), with over 85 percent black female students reporting that they
expected to attain at least some postsecondary education compared with roughly 78 percent
among the other groups. Expectations among all groups increased sharply during the 1980s and
1990s, though both white and black females reported higher expectations than white and black
males. For example, in 2006 over 95 percent of young women in twelfth grade expected to
attain at least some postsecondary education compared with only slightly more than 90 percent
of young men. Similar trends are apparent for expectations regarding BA completion shown in
Figure 3b.
Figure 4 shows similar trends for males and females who come from more versus less
advantaged backgrounds. In the mid-1970s, students whose parents had a BA degree had
substantially higher educational expectations than their peers. About 75 percent of males and
females with college educated parents expected a BA, while only 41 percent of females and 45
percent of males whose parents had less than a BA expected to do so. Interestingly, there was
little difference in expectations of at least some college across gender within the parental
education groups shown in this figure. However, by the mid-2000s with parental education
groups, fewer males expected to attain a BA than did females. During the past thirty years,

9

expectations for all groups have risen steadily, but it is striking that the expectations of young
women (from both more and less advantaged backgrounds) have risen more rapidly than the
expectations of young men. In fact, the percent of females whose parents had less than a high
school degree expecting a BA doubled between the mid- 1970s and mid-2000s, increasing from
41 percent to 82 percent.
V. The Relationship between Educational Expectations and Actual Enrollment
Researchers in the 1970s identified educational expectations as an important predictor of
educational and occupational attainment (Duncan, Featherman and Duncan, 1972; Sewell, Haller,
and Ohlendorf, 1970; Sewell, Haller, and Portes, 1969; Sewell and Hauser, 1972). 4 Even after
conditioning on an extensive set of family background characteristics, educational expectations
are strongly correlated with educational attainment (Duncan, Featherman, & Duncan, 1972;
Sewell & Hauser, 1980; Sewell, Hauser, & Wolf, 1980; Sewell & Shah, 1967). 5
Of course, this correlation does not necessarily imply that expectations have a causal
impact on attainment. The positive correlation may simply reflect the fact that individuals have
better information about their future path than can be captured with the measures commonly
available in the data used by researchers. For example, an individual may have access to money
for college from a relative that does not show up in the family income measures available in
standard datasets. Alternatively, some students with mediocre grades and test scores
undoubtedly have greater academic potential than others with similar high school performance.
If those with greater “unobserved potential” indicate higher educational expectations, one would

4

Although our analysis explicitly investigates expectations and outcomes, much of the prior research in this area
blurs the distinction concepts of expectations and aspirations. Because of ambiguity in the literature, unless the
author’s explicitly define aspirations as hopes for educational attainment, we use the term expectations opposed to
aspirations even in cases where the original researcher used aspirations.
5
The unconditional correlation between educational expectations and educational attainment tends to be on the
order of .6 to .7 (Sewell, Hauser, and Wolf, 1980; Teachman, 1987).

10

find a positive correlation due to the presence of this unobserved factor and not because of the
independent causal power of expectations themselves. In the analyses that follows, we not only
document the relationship between expectations and attainment, but take considerable pains to
assess, as best as possible, whether the documented relationship is causal or not.
To examine the relationship between expectations and enrollment, in Table 3 we present
results from regressions of postsecondary enrollment on tenth grade expectations and other
background variables. The top panel presents OLS estimates where the dependent variable is
enrolled in any postsecondary institution whereas the bottom panel presents estimates where the
dependent variable is enrolled in a four-year institution. Columns 1-3 show estimates in which
the only predictors are tenth grade expectations. Columns 4-6 present estimates from a model
that includes as predictors all family background variables, student demographics, and school
and county characteristics.
In columns 1-3, we see that tenth grade expectations are indeed strong predictors of
enrollment. For example, in the 2002 cohort of tenth graders, students who expected to attain at
least some college were 23 percentage points more likely to be enrolled in postsecondary
education than their peers who expected to attain at most a high school degree. Interestingly,
however, nearly 27 percent of students who, as tenth graders, did not expect to attain any college
were enrolled in college within two years of their expected high school graduation. Similarly,
students in this cohort who expected to attain a BA degree were roughly 41 percentage points
more likely to be enrolled in a four-year college. Again, it is interesting to note that roughly 7
percent of students with no expectations of college report being enrolled in a four-year college in
the second follow-up survey.

11

Even after we control for a host of individual, family and school characteristics, tenth
grade expectations are strongly predictive of eventual enrollment (columns 4-6). For example,
among the 2002 cohort of tenth graders, students who expected to attain at least some college
were about 14 percentage points more likely to be enrolled in postsecondary education than their
peers who expected to attain at most a high school degree. Similarly, students in this cohort who
expected to attain a BA degree were roughly 16 percentage points more likely to be enrolled in a
four-year college.
While these results indicate that expectations remain strong predictors of attainment
above and beyond other standard determinants of schooling, the data also reveal that
expectations have become somewhat less predictive of attainment over the past several decades.
In the 1980 cohort, tenth grade expectations explained roughly 25 percent of the variation
postsecondary enrollment. This figure decreased to roughly 20 percent for the 1990 cohort and
to roughly 15 percent in the 2002 cohort. The pattern is similar for BA attainment. One reason
for the decreasing explanatory power of expectations is that variance of expectations decreased
by about one-third between 1980 and 2002.
However, determining the causality in this association is difficult. Omitted variables
such as family wealth, personal connections or talent (athletic, musical, artistic) may be driving
the apparent relationship between expectations and attainment. Additionally, the potential for
reverse causality between expectations and the predictors is strong. For example, student grades
directly affect both expectations and attainment but expectations may also affect grades such that
as expectations increase students earn higher grades. The causal loop between expectations and
grades makes it difficult to determine the primary mechanism (that is, grades or expectations)
through which these two variables affect attainment.

12

To further examine the relationship between expectations and enrollment and attainment,
we estimate increasingly comprehensive specifications for attainment using data from the
sophomore class of 1990. These results, shown in Table 4, come from OLS regressions. Panels
A and B document the effects of expectations on enrollment and panels C and D show how
expectations affect attainment. The coefficients on the expectations variables in the enrollment
panels (A and B) are larger than those in attainment panels (C and D), but expectations remain
strong predictors of attainment. Within each panel, each successive column includes additional
predictors to demonstrate the robustness of the expectations effect. We see that the inclusion of
family background and individual demographics in column 2 in each panel reduces the effect of
expectations on both enrollment and attainment only slightly. The inclusion of high school
achievement measures in column 3, however, dramatically reduces the coefficients on the
expectations variables in each of the panels. Interestingly, the inclusion of a variety of nonachievement measures (column 4) including personality characteristics such as self-esteem and
locus of control as well as behavioral measures (for example, TV watching, homework
completion, suspensions, etc) have very little, if any, effect on the relationship between
expectations and enrollment and attainment. Similarly, the coefficients on expectations decrease
only slightly when measures of school characteristics (column 6) or school fixed effects (column
5) are added. The inclusion of county-level demographics and college cost variables (column 7)
also do not influence the relationship between expectations and attainment. The fact that the
inclusion of an increasingly rich set of observable characteristics does not change the
relationships between expectations and enrollment and expectations and attainment lends
credence to the view that expectations themselves may directly influence attainment.

13

In a further attempt to dissect the relationship between expectations and attainment, Table
5 shows results from OLS regressions of various tenth grade behaviors on eighth grade
expectations. If expectations had a causal impact on attainment, one would expect them to also
predict a host of mediating mechanisms such as time spent on homework, and high school GPA.
Of course, the existence of a relationship between early expectations and subsequent behaviors
associated with schooling success does not by any means prove that expectations influence
attainment. But the absence of such relationships would be troubling. The results in Table 5
show that college expectations are positively associated with academic outcomes such as GPA,
hours of homework per week and type of high school program, but are not related to selfreported absenteeism, self-reported TV watching, parent-reported behavior problems, or
personality measures such as self-esteem and locus of control. While the results are somewhat
mixed overall, the GPA and homework results are consistent with expectations having a causal
impact on achievement and attainment.
It is important to recognize, however, that the results presented in Tables 3, 4, 5 are
merely suggestive of a causal relationship between expectations and college enrollment and
completion. Without a randomized assignment experiment in which all potential confounding
factors are controlled for, we cannot be fully confident that increasing expectations will lead to
college enrollment and completion.
VI. Understanding the Gap between Expectations and Attainment
Prior literature has documented a substantial gap between the expectations and actual
attainment of young people. Figures 5 and 6 document the trends, by race and gender, in both
expectations and BA attainment. 6 Although expectations of a bachelor’s degree steadily
increased from about 60 percent in the early 1970s to over 80 percent by 2000, attainment of
6

Attainment data were collected from the U.S. Census Bureau.

14

such a degree did not rise accordingly for Blacks or whites. In fact, the percent of Blacks and
males completing a BA has remained fairly constant over this time period. A greater proportion
of females and whites have completed a BA today than in the early 1970s but the rising trend has
not kept pace with increases in expectations.
Understanding why students’ educational expectations are much higher than actual
attainment is important if it is desirable to change individuals’ expectations in an effort to attain
more optimal outcomes. The first step in doing this is to understand how young people form
educational expectations. Expectation formation is a complex process: individuals do not have
access to the same information and likely weight various factors differently in determining
expectations (Manski, 1993).
Determinants of Educational Expectations
Prior research documents a variety of factors that are associated with educational
expectations, including children’s own abilities and school experiences (Duncan, Featherman,
and Duncan, 1972; Hoelter, 1982; Sewell, Haller, and Portes, 1969; Teachman and Paasch, 1998)
family characteristics such as parental educational attainment and income (Duncan, Featherman
and Duncan, 1972; Kao and Tienda, 1998; Sewell, Haller, and Ohlendorf, 1970; Sewell, Haller,
and Portes, 1969; Teachman and Paasch, 1998) and neighborhood characteristics (Teachman and
Paasch, 1998). One means by which parental income likely influences children’s educational
expectations is by the ability to pay for post-secondary education (Astone and McLanahan, 1991;
McLanahan and Bumpass 1988). Parental involvement, as evidenced by activities such as
monitoring their child’s homework, offering encouragement about school related activities and
providing academic enrichment materials at home, is positively related to expectations (Astone
and McLanahan, 1991; Kao and Tienda, 1998; Schneider and Stevenson, 1999). Additionally,

15

parents’ educational expectations for their children affect the children’s educational expectations
(Davies and Kandel, 1981; Schneider and Stevenson, 1999). 7 A child’s community is important
for the development of expectations because it determines the types of interactions the child has
with peers and other adults (Teachman and Paasch, 1998).
Much of the literature focuses on the influence of teacher encouragement and
expectations and peer expectations, finding significant positive effects of both on expectations
(Davies and Kandel, 1981; Duncan, Featherman and Duncan, 1972; Hoelter, 1982; Kiuru,
Aunola, Vuori and Nurmi, 2006; Schneider and Stevenson, 1999; Sewell, Haller, and Ohlendorf,
1970; Sewell, Haller, and Portes, 1969). Similarly, when neighborhoods are socially,
economically, and racially segregated, expectations may be depressed. Children growing up in
neighborhoods of concentrated disadvantage likely do not have exposure individuals similar to
themselves and their families with high levels of educational attainment. Consequently, children
lack information about educational and occupational opportunities and may be unaware of the
economic benefits to educational attainment. (Ogbu, 1991; Stewart, Stewart, and Simmons, 2007;
Streufert, 1991; Wilson, 1987).
While the prior literature has documented strong correlations between the individual,
family and neighborhood characteristics and children’s educational expectations, it is not at all
clear that one should interpret these relationships as causal. For many of the reasons discussed
above, it may be that factors omitted from the statistical models explain the observed relationship.
For example, the value parents place on higher education influences the neighborhood in which a
child lives and the schools he or she attends, and may explain a child’s expectations. But it may
be hard to observe parents’ value of education, which is likely manifest in numerous ways,
7

However, the effect of parental expectations on children’s expectations can easily be overstated when parental
expectations are measured via the child’s perception, not the parent’s reported expectations (Davies and Kandel,
1981). Perceived parental expectations in part represent the expectations they are supposed to predict.

16

making it seem as though other correlated observables such as neighborhood explain a child’s
expectations.
Table 6 presents the determinants of tenth grade expectations for the NELS sophomore
cohort. The results generally confirm the findings of the prior literature. SES and academic
ability are the strongest predictors of expectations. Both SES and academic ability are positively
related to expectations such that higher SES students have higher expectations than lower SES
students and students with higher test scores and higher GPAs have higher expectations than
students with lower academic ability. The only school level variable that affects expectations is
enrollment in a private school, and this particularly true when looking at expectations of a BA or
more.
Determinants of Misalignment
With a general understanding of what determines expectations, we can begin to
investigate potential explanations for the gap between expectations and attainment. Researchers
have posed multiple explanations of the gap between expectations and attainment. In general,
the gap exists because students’ expectations are too high. Expectations are a student’s best
guess of their eventual attainment given their ability, family background, school quality, and
neighborhood—all factors that determine attainment. Hence, the expectations-attainment gap
implies inappropriate or “irrational” expectations given a student’s fixed characteristics and
experiences.
Researchers often describe the gap as a problem in course-taking or preparation. While it
is true that these factors influence attainment, they do not (technically) explain the gap given our
definition of expectations: a student's best estimate of attainment using available information. If
the question is how to help students attain their expectations, then these are reasonable paths to

17

pursue, but they do not offer insight into the causes of the expectations-attainment gap. There
are two potential causes of the gap: one, misinformation about costs and/or requirements of
college (that is, students expect they will be able to pay for college and easily complete the
coursework) or two, an unexpected shock occurs after students form their expectations, which
prevents them from attending. Shocks such as changes in family income or illness can be
positive as well as negative which would drive the gap in different directions and this is not the
pattern found in the data making random shocks an unlikely cause of the gap. The fact that most
students attain less education than they expect (the expectations-attainment gap is negative)
suggests that misinformation is the cause of the gap. Students have misinformation about the
cost of college, the preparation they will need and the difficulty of completing college. Even
conditional on adequate preparation and available funding students may simply realize that
college is not a good match for them (Orfield and Paul, 1994; Schneider and Stevenson, 1999).
When a student has expectations that are misinformed or the student is unprepared to
meet her expectations, sociologists say the student’s expectations are “misaligned.” Aligned
expectations are those that fit with other life goals and with ability and those that are stable
throughout high school (Schneider and Stevenson, 1999). Economists use slightly different
terminology, typically speaking of “rational” expectations or expectations that would result in
the largest economic gain for the individual given his/her affinity for schooling (Manski, 1993).
Previous research suggests that some groups are more likely to have misaligned
expectations than others. For example, a study of middle school students in two Massachusetts
schools showed that urban students had less alignment between their educational expectations
and their educational preparation (for example, college track v. vocational track) and their other
life plans (for example, age of marriage and age of pregnancy/children) (Malcolmson, 2007).

18

In Table 7 we develop a measure of alignment and attempt to discern which students are
more or less likely to have aligned expectations. We measure alignment in twelfth grade as the
predicted probability of reaching one’s twelfth grade expectations based upon observable twelfth
grade characteristics. Specifically, we regressed a binary indicator for a given level of
attainment (for example, BA degree, at least some college, high school) in 2000 (eight years after
expected high school graduation) on a host of student, family, school and neighborhood factors
measured as of twelfth grade. Using the coefficients from this regression, we predicted the
probability that each student would attain the level of education they expected in twelfth grade.
This prediction becomes the alignment measure for the student. For example, if a student
expected to attain a BA degree, but the predicted likelihood of this is only .36, the student’s
expectations are not particularly well aligned. If a student only expected to complete some
college, then we use the predicted probability that she or he will attain at least some college as
the measure of alignment. (Note that in this way we consider misalignment in a positive
direction – predicted to attain more education than expected – the same as alignment.) Students
assigned a higher value on our alignment measure are more likely to reach their expectations and
low alignment values correspond to a low probability of reaching one’s expectations and a
greater degree of misalignment.
Table 7 displays the results of a series of multilevel models estimating what affects
expectation alignment in twelfth grade. With the full set of predictors (Column 5) the results
show that lower SES students are less likely to reach their expectations and high achieving
students are more likely to reach their expectations. Not surprisingly, students in larger schools
and those with greater proportions of student eligible for free- and reduced-priced lunch are less
likely to reach their expectations, and as the average test score in a school rises so too does the

19

likelihood that a student a within that school will reach her expectations. Positively, students
with more “aligned” expectations—higher predicted probabilities of reaching their
expectations—in eighth grade are more likely to reach to their twelfth grade expectations. This
finding highlights the importance of developing realistic and informed expectations early in a
student’s academic career.
Perhaps, schools can play a role solidifying the link between expectations and attainment.
The bottom of Column 1 shows that about thirty percent of the variance in the predicted
probability of reaching twelfth grade expectations schools can be explained by schools. Yet,
once student characteristics such as demographics, family background variables, and academic
ability are added to the model, schools only explain only seven percent of the variance in
misalignment. Observable school characteristics such as the percent of free- and reduced-price
lunch students, school size, and the number of students per guidance counselor account for about
3 percent of school level explained variance, leaving about 4 percent of the total variance in
misalignment unexplained at the school level. Schools appear to be only minimally capable of
helping students develop aligned expectations. Students’ own characteristics explain
misalignment much more than which high school they attended.
VII. Informed Educational Expectations
Much of the expectations literature questions students’ abilities to develop informed
expectations, arguing that individuals often do not have the information needed to form aligned
expectations or to accurately calculate the returns to schooling (Manski, 2004; Orfield and Paul,
1994; Schneider and Stevenson, 1999). However, recent research suggests that college students
may indeed update their expectations based on knowledge about their academic ability gained
during school (Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner, 2009; Zafar, 2009). Stinebrickner and

20

Stinebrickner (2009) follow Berea College students from entrance through each semester of
persistence, tracking their expected and actual performance. They find that students update their
expectations based on their actual grade performance, with students whose performance is
significantly lower than expected being more likely to drop-out than students whose performance
is as expected or better than expected. Zafar (2009) studied the expectations of college students
at Northwestern University and found evidence of updating consistent with Stinebrickner and
Stinebrickner (2009). Specifically, Zafar (2009) found that students revise their expectations of
future GPAs based on their prior GPAs. Perhaps more interestingly, Zafar (2009) found that
individuals are more likely to make revisions to expectations with higher degrees of uncertainty
such as workplace outcomes than to revise expectations that are initially held with certainty such
as parental approval and college completion.
To date, the literature has not investigated how high school students update their
expectations. The data presented in Figures 2a and 2b showing that students lower expectations
of BA completion from eighth to twelfth grade provides some evidence that students do change
their expectations as they move through the educational process, acquiring new information. If
high school students do update their expectations based new information, policy interventions
designed to help high school students develop rational/realistic expectations may be successful.
In this section, we analyze NELS data to determine if, when, and why high school students
update their expectations. 8
Table 8 provides descriptive statistics on updating. Each row presents statistics on a
different time period, with the fraction of students shown in the cells and the number of
observations in square brackets. In row 1, we see that roughly 61 percent of students changed
8

Because the NELS is the most longitudinally comprehensive of the NCES surveys, spanning from eighth grade to
eight years after expected high school graduation, we rely exclusively on the NELS to analyze updating behavior
among students.

21

expectations at least once between 1988 and 2000, with 24 percent changing exactly twice and
14 percent changing three or more times. (Note that students were surveyed in five years – 1988,
1990, 1992, 1994 and 2000 – so that a maximum of four changes that can be captured in this data.
To the extent that students update more frequently, we may be understating the extent of
instability in expectations.) Perhaps not surprisingly, considerably more students lowered their
expectations between 1988 and 2000 (29 percent) than raised their expectations (13 percent). 9
Row 2 shows that virtually all students who changed over the entire period did so at least
once in the first six years from 1988 to 1994. This makes sense insofar as one might expect that
students learn a great deal about their potential success in college during and immediately
following high school. Interestingly, if one compares expectations in eighth grade with
expectations six years later, we see that slightly more students increased their expectations (19
percent) than decreased (15 percent). However, between 1994 and 2000, 28 percent of young
people lowered their expectations compared with 6 percent who increased them and roughly 66
percent who did not change their expectations (row 3).
Looking within the high school years, we see that 35 percent of students changed their
expectations between eighth and tenth grades. Interestingly, 13 percent increased their
expectations during this period while 22 percent lowered their expectations. Between tenth and
twelfth grades, roughly 15 percent of students raised their expectations while 10 percent lowered
their expectations (and 75 percent did not change their expectations).
Given that students frequently change their expectations during high school and that
updating is not a random process, as students are more likely to update downward, we examine
9

Note that the sample used to calculate the statistics in columns 7 and 8 differs somewhat from the sample used to
calculate the statistics in columns 1-6. This is because in order to have data in columns 7-8, respondents must have
had non-missing expectations data in both 1988 and 2000, whereas in order to have data in columns 1-6,
respondents only had to have non-missing expectations data in two (or more) of the five survey waves from 1988 to
2000.

22

the nature of updating. We first explore whether students with in certain schools are more likely
to update than others. Table 9 presents results from OLS regressions of updating on various
individual characteristics. We include high school fixed effects, so that we identify the
relationships off of variation within each of the 1,016 schools included in the NELS eighth grade
survey. 10
SES and academic achievement are the strongest predictors of updating. Eighth graders
in the lower SES quintiles update more than students in the highest SES quintile and males
update more often than females. In fact, students in the lowest SES quintile are about 50 percent
more likely to have updated their expectations than students in the highest SES quintile. Lower
achieving students are also predicted to update more often than higher achieving students. More
disadvantaged youth (in terms of family income and academic achievement) update their
expectations more often than peers. These socio-economically and academically disadvantaged
students start out with extremely high expectations and, in general, lower them during high
school. Interestingly, students with lower scores on indices of self-concept and locus of control
and those that complete fewer hours of homework of per week are also more likely to update at
least once between eighth and twelfth grade than students with high scores on the indices and
those completing more hours of homework. Interestingly, the F-test for joint significance of the
school fixed effects shows that schools seem to matter only in terms of updating expectations at
least once between eighth and twelfth grade, but not for updating twice. This result suggests that
serial updaters—those updating twice between eighth and twelfth grade—are influenced more by
individual student and family characteristics rather than schools.

10

On average there are eighteen students per school. The minimum number of students at a school is one and the
maximum number of students is fifty-eight. The schools at the twenty-fifth percentile have fourteen students and
schools at the seventy-fifth percentile have twenty-two students.

23

Next, we investigate whether or not students update in a systematic way based on the
acquisition of new information. To do so, we estimate the determinants of updating with panel
data models and student fixed effects. These models essentially examine whether within-student
changes in factors such as academic performance are systematically associated with withinstudent changes in educational expectations. The results in Table 10 demonstrate that changes in
GPA are positively associated with changes in expectations, but that changes in test scores and
SES are not associated with changes in expectations. When looking only at expectations for a
BA, changes in test scores become positively associated with expectations in the models
spanning from eighth grade (1988) to twelfth grade and beyond (1992 and 1994). Having a child
is a strong predictor of decreasing expectations.
Table 11 presents results separately for a variety of subgroups. Interestingly, students in
the two lowest SES quintiles do not seem to update expectations based upon changes in GPA.
Yet, GPA has the strongest association with updating for minority students and those in the
fourth and fifth SES quintiles. For minorities, a one standard deviation increase in GPA is
associated with over one-tenth of point increase in expectations, or about a 5 percent increase.
The same increase in GPA is predicted to increase the expectations of students in the fourth and
fifth SES quintiles by almost one-tenth of a point (about a 3.5 percent increase). Although
negatively associated with the expectations of all groups, having a child is particularly
detrimental to the overall expectations of minorities and those in the middle SES quintile and the
highest test score quartile; having a child is associated with almost a 9 percent decrease in
expectations for minorities (.223 points), a 7 percent decrease in the highest SES quintile (.183
points), and a 10 percent decrease for students with the highest test scores (.292 points). 11

11

To check the panel analysis assumptions we ran the 1988-1990 full model with the cross-sectional data, and found
even stronger statistically significant relationships between expectations and GPA and expectations and test scores.

24

The bottom of Table 11 displays the results of changing academic and family
characteristics on the expectation of a BA by subgroups. The results are generally similar to
those reported in the top panel, but a few differences are noteworthy. Changes in test scores are
positively associated with expectations of a BA for males, whites, and those in the second test
score quartile. The magnitudes of these relationships are small, but statistically significant. In
general, almost all groups seem to update in the predicted directions based on changes in GPA
and changes in parent status, but some groups are more affected by these changes than others.
Interestingly, students in the middle of the SES distribution (that is, in the third and fourth
quintiles) and students in the tails of the test score distribution seem to be the most influenced by
changes in academic achievement. These results lend support to the conclusion that students
develop informed expectations, relying mostly upon their own academic achievement to
determine their college expectations. Yet, many students still do not reach their expectations,
suggesting that the updating that takes place during high school based upon academic
achievement is not sufficient to link expectations to attainment.
Misunderstandings with regard to the costs of college may contribute to the observed
expectations-attainment gap. Although, economic circumstances have not played a large role in
the models thus far, the costs of college are the focus of many studies investigating barriers to
college entry and completion, and states have control over the costs of their public higher
education institutions. Beginning in the early 1990s states began adopting broad based merit aid
programs that award tuition and fees to student residents that meet a fairly low threshold of
academic achievement, such as a high school GPA of 3.0 (Dynarski, 2004). The adoption of
statewide merit aid programs was a dramatic shift from prior aid programs that at the federal
level consisted mostly of need based aid (that is, Pell Grants and Stafford Loans) and at the state

25

level occurred mainly as subsidies to public universities to keep tuition and fees low (Dynarksi,
2004). 12 Research suggests that broad based statewide merit aid programs have the potential to
increase college enrollment. The literature concludes that a $1,000 decrease in college tuition is
associated with about a 3.5 percent increase in enrollment (Dynarksi, 2003; Kane, 1995; Leslie
and Brinkman, 1987).
Expectations may be a mediating factor between state merit aid programs and college
enrollment. For this reason, Table 12 demonstrates the effects of state-run broad based merit
scholarship programs on the expectations of two cohorts, the sophomore classes of 1990 and
2002. Controlling for state fixed effects, changes in the cost of college based upon the
implementation of a statewide merit aid program do not appear to influence student expectations
for college. Because almost all sophomores in 1990 and 2002 expected to attend at least some
college, the adoption of a statewide merit aid program may have provided the impetus for more
of these students to act upon their high expectations and enroll in college, instead of raising the
expectations of the10 percent of students who did not expect to attend any post-secondary
education.
VIII. Conclusion
Expectations increased substantially since the early 1980s, but seem to have leveled off
with almost everyone expecting at least some college. Individual, family background and school
characteristics have become less predictive of student expectations over time. Expectations have
become somewhat less predictive of attainment but remain strong predictors of attainment above
and beyond other standard determinants of schooling. Determined largely by factors outside of
the school walls, expectations do appear to have an important influence on college enrollment

12

Merit aid programs did exist at both the federal and state levels prior to the early 1990s but these programs were
very small and targeted at the very highest performing students such as the National Merit Scholarship.

26

and persistence. Over 60 percent of students update their expectations at least once between
eighth grade and eight years post-high school. Updating seems to be somewhat based on
acquisition of new information, particularly ability, especially for marginal students in terms of
college entry. Early alignment of expectations is predictive of greater likelihood of reaching
later expectations. Demographic characteristics of students and schools explain away a
substantial portion of the between school variation in the likelihood of students reaching their
expectations. State policies decreasing the costs of college do not seem to influence student
expectations.
These results suggest that to generate a cohort of students with expectations likely to lead to
enrollment and persistence in post-secondary education, policies should be directed at helping
middle school students attain their maximum academic potential. Students rely on knowledge of
their academic ability to develop and maintain their expectations, lowering their expectations
when presented with indicators of lower academic ability and raising their expectations when
given signals of higher academic ability.
