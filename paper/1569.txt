Market, Government, and
Israel1s Muted Baby Boom
ABSTRACT

Cohorts born in Israel since the late 1910s were approximately 70
percent larger than earlier cohorts. This brought about changes in the

age structure that are even more dramatic than the American baby boom.

This paper follows the impact of the large cohorts on the school
system and on the labor market, emphasizing the role played by the
public sector.

In terms of the number of teaching posts the school system
demonstrated on the whole a very prompt ability to adjust to the
pressure of high number of pupils. However, as rates of growth of
pupils decelerated, inputs in the school system failed to adujst down.

As a result, when the larger cohorts moved up the educational scale,
the combination of rapid adjustment where they arrived and sluggish
adjustment imparted an upward pressure to the aggregate expenditure on
education.

When the large cohorts arrived at the age of entry into the labor
force the impact was delayed and muted by a rapid expansion of the
army and of the universities. Relative earnings cf the young men 18_211

declined sharply during the decade. The earnings of the very young

seem to be responsive to the relative size of a broader age group

(18—3), as well as to

the size elderly (65

plus).

MARKET, GOVERNMENT, AND ISRAEL'S MUTED BABY BOOM*

Rapid changes arouse curiosity, and this paper is motivated by such
curiosity. There is a great deal of
observe —

in

variety in the rapid changes that we

cohort size, age distribution, entry of women into the labor

market, the level of education, ethnic
changes are exogenous to the

composition, etc. Some of these

contemporary economic, demographic or social

scene, some may result from other changes;

some are expected and some come

as a surprise.

Generally, a problem is defined and

a research program is designed

around endogenous variables. In seeking explanations for a phenomenon
we
construct hypotheses, propose theories, or speculate about its causes

which either predispose

one towards specific independent variables or

impose a preselection of such variables.

It is less clear how to chart a

research project around an exogenous change: here is an exogenous
variable
which may affect everything (or

nothing) under the sun. If it appears in

many equations, what are we after?
One argument in favor of

focusing on large—scale changes is that they

may generate sufficiently robust findings

that wIll show up even if the

analysis fails to take many other

variables into account, so that they
provide more dramatic experiments for
dealing with conventional questions.
Another is that rapid changes

can reveal different aspects of social and

economic systems from those we learn about in the normal
course of events,
i.e., they invite different

types of questions. What we ask and what we

2

hope to learn has to do with the adaptability of society to rapid changes:
the assessment of the capacity to

absorb shocks, and the identification of

bottlenecks and rigidities. This is a question of dynamics; the emphasis
is not on a particular variable but on

the phenomenon of rapid change. Now

of
it also makes sense to compare different cases of rapid change and ways
adjusting to them. While the exogenous shocks may stem from diverse
causes, the sets of protagonists

and the relevant bottlenecks in each case

may have much in common.

Several studies have examined the specific effect of cohort size on
wages and unemployment (Welch,

1979; Freeman, 1979; and Wachter, 1976).

Detailed documentation and arguments for the U.S. presented by Easterlin
(1980) and Russell (1982) trace the history and discuss the consequences
of the American baby boom. Easterlin (1980)

and Jones (1980) focus on the

unique experience of the baby boom generation. Louise Russel (1982) argues
that on the whole the baby boom was not a very important phenomenon her
judgement relates not to the presence or absence of partial effects but to
the robustness or dominance of the phenomenon.
Israel experienced a baby boom in the 1950s. In view of the keen
interest in the American baby boom, one wonders whether the Israeli
version had any effect. The sources of the Israeli baby boom were analyzed
by Friedlander (1975). The potential significance of the rapid change in
age structure was pointed out by Kop (1980).

I. THE BOOM

The Jewish population of Israel is based on immigrants, most of whom

3

arrived in the past century. Immigration occurred in waves, inducing
uneven growth in the total population. The single most significant wave
occurred in 1948—51 when the population doubled. Subsequent immigration
rates fluctuated, but were much lower; between 1951 and 1973 the Jewish
population grew at 3.8 percent annually, of which immigration directly
contributed 47 percent. Between 1974 and 1980 the population grew at an

annual rate of 2.1 percent, the migration balance contributing only 20
percent.

Looking at the age structure of the population in 1955 we see that
the age group 0—4 numbered 214 thousand, while the age group 10—14, i.e.,

those aged 0—4 in 1945, numbered only 122 thousand (Figure 1 and Table
A—i). Obviously, the jump in the size of cohorts is translated to big
spurts in the rate of increase over time of particular age groups (see

Table 1). The dramatic change was brought about by a combination of the
large and concentrated immigration, the higher fertility of immigrants, a
baby boom among immigrants (Friedlander, 1975), and perhaps some making up
of births delayed abroad prior to immigration (Ben—Porath, 1980).
Most of the Jewish population in Palestine before 1948 was of
European origin (EA); only approximately one tenth originated from the
Arab countries of the Middle East (AA: Asia—Africa). Mass immigration was
more equally divided between these two groups. AA women bore far more
children than EA women —

in

1951 total fertilitjr of AA women was 6.31

while that of EA women was 3.16 and that of Israel—born women was 3.56.1
To these compositional differences there was added a baby boom within the
migrant population. The figures on age structure in 1950 for the European
born (not shown) indicate a deficiency in the size of the 5—19 age group
(i.e., those born in 1931—1945); the largest deficiency is for people born

4

in 1941—1945, which partly reflects the effect of the war and the
holocaust on births and the creation and resumption of family life after
the war.2
The subsequent changes in cohort size are a result of reduced
immigration and fertility, and an echo of the first boom.
The crude birth rate declined sharply in the 1950s, increased between
1965 and 1975, and declined again from 1975 to 1980 (Table 2). The decline
in the 1950s was largely a result of the steep decline in age—specific
fertility coupled with a sharp drop in the share of women of the main
childbearing age (20—34) in the population. These outweighed the change in
the composition of women by continent of origin which, by itself, should
have raised fertility: because of the composition of immigration, the
share of women from AA among women of peak childbearing age, which must
have been less than 10 percent before 1948, rose to 22 percent in 1950, 35
percent in 1955, and 43 percent in 1960. This is only part of the story.

The decline in age—specific fertility rates continued throughout the
period, mostly among the immigrants from Asia and Africa whose fertility
converged down towards the levels of the European immigrants; only in
recent periods was there a decline also among the latter. Between 1965 and
1975 we observe the echo of the original baby boom. The number of women
aged 20—34 rose from 215 thousand in 1965 to 347 thousand in 1975, an
increase of 60 percent, while the total population of women rose by only
30 percent. Children aged 0—4 increased in this period by 39 percent.
There has been a trend towards postponed marriages which accounted
for some of the decline in age—specific fertility rates. The marked
decline in the proportion married between 1965 and 1970, coupled with a
sharp narrowing of age differentials between brides and grooms, reflect

5

the coming of age of large cohorts of nubile women with some scarcity in
the older male cohorts. Ben Moshe (1983) has found that the marriage
squeeze brought about a decline in the age—specific marriage rates of
women and an increase in the marriage rates of men.

II. THE SCHOOL SYSTEM

The relevant age group for elementary school is roughly 5—14. and the one
relevant for high school is roughly 14—17. The evolution of these groups'
sizes is as follows:

Friedlander (1975) has demonstrated the effect

of mass

immigration and the

baby boom on Israel's school system by citing the absolute number of
children aged exactly 6 (in thousands): 1947 — 01.5; 1952 —

45.0;

1962 —

47.2.

31.1; 1957 —

During the 1950s the proportion of pupils out of this

rapidly growing population increased steeply, converging towards full
coverage in elementary schools by the end of the 1950s. Among those aged

6

14—17 the proportion enrolled in schools rose from 43 percent in 1952 to
60 percent in 1960, fluctuated for several years when the population grew
at peak rates, and then resumed its growth in the mid—1960s to reach 80
percent in 1980. (Note that elementary education has been free and
compulsory in Israel since 1949; secondary—schooling is free since 1978).
The most amazing thing occurred right at the start. There were 125
thousand pupils in the Hebrew educational system (excluding higher

education) in 1948/9. In 1951/2 the number reached 284 thousand, an
increase of 126 percent (or an annual rate of increase of 31.3 percent).
At the same time, the number of teachers' posts increased by 123 percent,
so that the average number of pupils per teaching—post hardly changed!
This, in a country whose total population had doubled, and where the

immigrant population was illiterate —

at

country and often illiterate in general —

best in the language of the

or

had relatively low levels of

schooling. The increased supply of teachers therefore had to come from the
absorbing population. It is a well—known fact that this rapid expansion
took its toll in terms of a deterioration in teachers' qualifications; it
is, in fact, remarkable that the response in quantities was so close to
perfect and that all the pressures translated into quality reduction. It

would have been reasonable to suppose that the quality—quantity tradeoff
would be more evenly balanced: a higher teaching load borne by few, but
better qualified teachers. We get a similar picture in the U.S. baby boom

where certification standards of teachers were lowered, and the student!
teacher ratio reflected only small pressures (Russell, 1982), p. 30.
Let us now examine this response in greater detail. The wave of
increase 1948/9—1951/2 affected elementary and secondary schools more—or—
less to the same degree, with very little change in the student/teaching—

7

post ratio (Table 3). In the following years the number of elementary—
school pupils kept rising, though at a decreasing rate, until around
1964/5. During this period of rapid growth, which also included the entry
of the baby—boom cohorts, the number of teaching—posts and classrooms
increased proportionately with practically no change in the student!
teacher/classes ratios. During the next 12 years of stability (or some
decline) in the number of pupils — 1964—76

-,

the number of teaching—posts

kept rising, sharply reducing the ratio of pupils to teaching—posts. This
reduction continued when the growth of the student population resumed in
1976—82, the echo of the first baby boom.

The growth of the student population in secondary schools also
decelerated gradually, but was nonetheless quite high throughout the
period. In the l950s a significant part of this growth was caused by the
increase in the rate of school enrolment

among teenagers (secondary—school

enrolment rates for the 14—17 age group rose from 23.4 to 1952 to 46.5 in
1959). This is the only period in which the pressure of students was not
met by a proportional increase in teachers and classrooms (Table 3). The
early l960s marked the arrival of the large cohorts to secondary school
age. The age group 14—17 increased from 107 thousand in 1959 to 200
thousand in 1965. These new cohorts also differed by origin — a
higher
fraction of Asia—Africa origin. For the secondary school system this

growth meant several years in which school enrolment remained

fairly

stable, probably due to the change in the composition of the teenage
population by origin rather than a supply constraint on the part of the
system itself. The figures in Table 3 show that the slightly higher rate
of increase of students in this period (compared to 1952—59) was matched
by an increase in both teachers and classrooms. When cohort size and

8

composition stabilized, the increase

in enrolment rates was renewed (46.1

in 1964, 64.4 in 1979), which meant that inputs (teachers, classrooms)
rose faster than students, improving the relevant input ratios.
It is probably no accident that a reform that broke down the two—tier

6—
system of 8 years of elementary and 4 years of secondary school into a
3—3 system was introduced in the late 1960s after the pressures exerted by
the growing number of pupils had subsided.
Going back in time, we have to trace what happened to teenage
employment. In the late 1950s approximately
third of the girls aged 14—17 were in

two fifths of the boys and one

the labor force. This meant leaving

school early and starting work, to be interrupted at age 18 by army
service for 2 to 3 years, and then returning

to the labor market. The rate

of labor force participation of the 14—17 age group was on the decline
between 1955 and 1960. In 1959 the growth of the 14—17 age group began
accelerating and, as noted, this influx was associated with a change in
composition by origin and with a temporary halt in the increase in school
enrolment. It was also associated with a halt in the declining trend of
teenagers' labor force participation. Between

1960 and 1965 the number of

teenage workers doubled and their proportion in the labor force increased
from 3.2 to 5.6 for boys, and from 6.3 to 9.7 for girls. Still, the rate
of unemployment of the group did not increase in response to this influx.
1967 was the trough of a depression and teenage unemployment

reached 30.4

percent (whereas the normal level before that was 12—14 percent), the size
of the group stabilized, and the rate of labor force participation resumed
its rapid decline: teenage employment gradually

III. ON THE REACTION OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR

The above discussion indicates that in terms of the rough physical
indicators there has been a very responsive accomodation of the change in
cohort size by the public sector. There was one period in which pressure

was felt in the secondary schools, and there was also an improvement in
quantitative standards when pressures subsided. Of course, the quality

aspect is not discussed here; the deterioration in teachers' quality in
the period of undiscriminating recruitment may have affected the quality
of education received by children who went to school in the 1950s.
There is no general accepted framework within which the reaction of
the public sector can be analyzed. Various models of the public sector can
be examined: (a) a bureaucratic machine that has some quasi—firm responses
to changing prices or demand pressures, but also stickiness in certain
parameters (budgets or various indicators of performance); (b) a
benevolent maximizer of a perceived social welfare; (c) a political entity
intent on maximizing support or moved by self—seeking politicians and
bureaucrats. For any particular government response, one could find a
rationale in more than one view.

Large—scale demographic changes cause large changes in the number of
clients the government serves: in schools (in the case of the baby boom),
in health services (for the elderly), etc. Such pressures can be expected
to lead to a deterioration of services for

a variety of reasons: a quasi—

firm argument is based on upward sloping (and

perhaps short—run) inelastic

supply curves of the factors used to provide the services. A bureaucratic
argument is based on short term stickiness of budget allocations which

10

would impart an elasticity of —1 to the curve relating expenditure per
client to the number of clients. From a static political—economy point of
view, if rapid pressures sharply increase
a particular group of supporters,

the marginal cost of satisfying

there is an argument to seek the support

of others. A benevolent government, too, would shift the distribution of
its efforts in response to changes in relative costs. There are therefore
plenty of reasons to expect a short run downward sloping curve relating
government services per client to the number of clients.
What if the government copes swiftly with certain aspects

of crises

and shocks with little or no decline in the level of services, i.e., has a
short term elastic curve relating expenditures or performance to clients?
This may reflect some bureaucratic or public attachment to certain
parameters, it may reflect real social priorities of a benevolent
government, or it may reflect a political system which has a built—in bias
towards handling crises. We can describe the political process in the
following terms: governments seek support, which is presumed to depend on
government actions. The support of most people is quite inert in the short

run, and unresponsive to government activities in many fields, including
thinly spread changes in taxation or the quality of services (see Olson,

1982; and Peltzman, 1976). However, at different times certain topics can
become political issues, i.e., the way in which the government handles a
problem will significantly affect the support it gets. This may be so
either because the topic is high on the minds of the public at large, or
because a particular group in the population will sway its support based
solely on the way a specific issue is resolved. The issues more likely to
get government response are those where the group of beneficiaries is well

defined while th cost is spread out thin, because of the inert reaction

11

described above. Obviously, there are advantages to government
expenditures that have a public good property so that they satisfy nore
than one group. Particularly notable is the convergence of interests of
clients of services and their suppliers.

Demographic structure and changes fit well into such a framework. For
example, the elderly are likely to be highly responsive to how the
government treats them because of their relatively high dependence on
government support, which should afford them some protection against the
adverse effects of their size. Shocks of the sort discussed here are a
natural source of issues. By definition, they create problems relating
directly or indirectly to well—defined groups in the population. (Often
there is also an interested party of

government employees.) The problems

associated with a rapidly growing group may become an issue over which
that group's support could easily sway, depending on government action.
This may make the government's short run 'demand curve' more elastic,
i.e., it

will

services

that it provides. In fact, there are indications here that such a

make an extra effort to minimize the reduction in the

mechanism may make the government overly responsive to major challenges,

under the supposition that politically—induced rapid adjustment entails
neglect of other, less dramatic issues that the government is supposed to
take care of, neglect of less visible aspects of the problem, etc.
The same rationale carries over to the role of government as an
employer. When young men

or

large numbers of women flood the labor market

and the government steps in to employ them, this too is open to
interpretation on several levels: (a) as the response of a quasi—firm
moving along a downward SloT)iflg demand curve for the factors it uses to
produce

services for the population; (b) as the response of a bureaucracy

12

intent on keeping a claim to certain budgetary allocation slanting demand
towards unitary elasticity; (c) as the political concern of a government
with the ramifications of sharp declines in relative incomes or the

emergence of unemployment in groups that it is concerned about, providing
some kind of employment/income insurance through

its functions as an

employer. This ties in with our earlier comment on the double—barreled
effect of expenditures that both serve clients and provide government
employment. Certainly the most dedicated opponents of cuts in social
budgets include social workers, and the staunchest (if not always
successful) defenders of budgets for research and higher learning are
university professors.

What happens when the tide ebbs? Is there symmetry in the reaction?
Or should we expect the level of services to continue to increase after
the number of clients has declined (or growth has levelled off)? The
quasi—firm argument probably says yes. The initial pressure on specific

factors supplying the services may create lagged supply response shifting
relative costs in favor of improvements in areas previously under
pressure. Bureaucratic arguments would predict the same — budgets
eventually respond to pressures and are certainly downward sticky. The
political argument works in the same direction: where government
employment was rapidly created to meet the growth in demand, the group of
suppliers has been strengthened. This asymmetry in the response to rising
and falling needs imparts an upward bias to public sector expenditures.
The figures on national expenditure on education are consistent with our
conjecture (Table 4): the shares of the different levels change in
response to changing pressures, but this is done by upward pressure on
total expenditure, accompanied by an increased share of GNP allocated to

13

education. Ofer (1983) has shown how the real expenditure per student in
elementary and secondary education related to per capita GNP rose from
12.9 percent in 1962 to 19.3 in 1978. His figures for the post—secondary

level show a slight decline in expenditure per student (deflated by GNP
per capita) when the system expanded (from 66.0 to 62.7 between 1962 and
1972, respectively), and a sharp increase afterwards (it reached 73.7 in
1978). As we shall see below, the higher education system also reacted
swiftly to the increase in its clientelle.
In the case of the education system, the employment aspect of an

expansion in this system should be discussed in conjunction with the
increase in women's labor force participation. The tremendous increase in

women's participation, particularly through the 1970s, could be viewed as
a quasi—shock in its own right (see Ben—Porath, 1983). But unlike the
changes in cohort size, there is some ambiguity in ascribing this shock to
purely exogenous causes. One hypothesis is that what we observe is largely

a long—term increase in demand that encouraged women's investment in
schooling, stimulated their entry into the labor force, and led to
associated changes in family—planning strategy. Alternatively, one could
place the responsibility on various supply—side factors —

schooling,

attitudes, etc. There may also have been some sort of an income effect
from the direction of young men, which would fit in with the decline in
fertility observed in the late 1970s, and be consistent with Easterlin's
interpretation (1980). Either way, the gestation period of schooling may
create excess supply in the short run.

The government certainly played a major role in expanding the

opportunities for higher education by financing a large fraction of the
growth of that system. More to the point here, is its role on the demand

14

side: the public sector is the major employer of women, and employs a
large fraction of the growth of women in the labor force. This was

accomplished partly by expanding of employment in public services and
partly by substitution of men. The public sector had a fairly elastic
demand curve and was thus ready to provide employment to the women whom it

helped educate. The growth of employment in the public sector occurred at
a time when it is more naturally interpreted as a response to supply than
to demand phenomena (see Klinov, 1983).

The school system is an important element here. There has been a
strong feminization of the teaching profession, demonstrated in the
following figures: women's share in teachers' posts rose from 52.5 percent
in 1948/9, 58.3 percent in 1959/60, 63.7 percent in 1969/70 to 73.9
percent in 1981/2. The decline in the student/teacher ratio, noted above,
occurred when the student population had stopped growing (in elementary
and secondary schools), and while more and more educated women were
entering the labor market. These are probably connected. There is no
operational difference between the view that the government reacted to the
increased supply of women as a quasi—firm, with a fairly elastic demand
curve, and with the hypothesis that this elastic demand curve was

designed

to protect the level of employment and relative wages of an important part
of. the population.

A similar phenomenon occurred in another sphere of demographic
change: the increase in the number of the elderly. Here are the rates of
growth of the old—age support per recipient provided by Israel's National
Insurance Institute, and of the number of recipients:

This is, however, a tentative picture and should be studied further.
Another case from a different field has to do with defense expenditure.

Berglas (1983), who analyzed the evolution of defense expenditure in
Israel, noted a step function marked by a series of wars. While the
increases may have been inevitable, the absence of downward adjustment is
part of the same asymmetry.

IV.

ENTRY INTO ADULT ACTIVITIES

The baby boom of the l950s had a dramatic effect on the age structure of
the adult population in the 1970s. This can be appreciated by comparing
the Israeli figures with those describing the American baby boom:

Adult activities consist of work and higher education, generally following
army service.

This section refers mainly to the male population. For some general
background on the role of age changes and participation rates consult
Table A—2 and A—3 which show (a) that the ratio of employed persons to the
population aged 14+ has been on the decline since 1955, but more
emphatically so in 1965—75 and (b) that this was due to the change that
occurred in age structure, mostly in the period 1960—70, and to
significant reductions in labor participation in 1965—75. The main trends
of the employment history of young men are presented in Table 5 and Figure
2. The participation rate of the 18—24 age group dropped in three steps:
from 1966 to 1967, from 1968 to 1970, and from 1973 to 1974. Over the
whole period 1965—75 the drop was from 52.6 to 34.9 percent, a truly
remarkable change for such a short period. The result was that in spite of
a 66 percent increase in the mean population aged 18—24 the number
employed rose only moderately from 1965 to 1973, and in 1980 was more or
less equal to what it was fifteen years earlier.

The most rapid increase in the size of the 25—29 age group occurred
between 1970 and 1975. Our data allow us to observe only the group aged

17

25—34 where we see a significant decline in participation (4.9 p.p.), more

pronounced than before 1970 or after 1975, The annual data show that the
decline occurred between 1968 and 1975 (7.8 p.p.). This was against a
background of some, but milder decline in participation of older men.

Thus, the major part of the story of the demographic shock is that
entry into the labor market was delayed. The army played an important role
here. Military service is compulsory and universal for both men and women
(though exemptions are granted, mainly to women, on religious grounds).
There is also a career army, and

many conscripts sign up for an extended

term of duty before going on to work or study, This is clearly a powerful
instrument with which the public sector can affect the impact of changing
cohort size on the rest of the system. Two of the sharp declines in the
participation rate of the 18—24 group coincide with the wars fought in
1967 and 1973, both of which were followed by increase in the size of the
army. While we have no reliable estimates, there is a basis for
that a significant portion of the delay

arguing

occurred through army service.

Obviously, the shift in demand by the military was autonomous; the ability
to satisfy this demand was, however, certainly enhanced by the demographic
context.

The other obvious route to consider is

schooling, The universities

grew most rapidly in the late 1960s and early l97Os (in 1965—75 the number
of students almost tripled). The share of students in the population aged
20—29 increased sharply from 1964/5 to 1972/3, and declined slightly after
1974/5. For the 20—24 age group, most of the increase in the enrolment

rate occurred between 1965 and 1969, while for

the age group 25—29 it

continued until 1972/3. The expansion was strongly reflected in resource
allocation: as already indicated, 12.9 percent of the national expenditure

18

were allocated to post—secondary

and higher education in 1962, 16.4

percent in 1965, peaking in 1975 at 25.1 percent, and then slowly
declining (Table 4). During the period

of highest pressure the ratio of

students to academic staff did not deteriorate, and as the number of
students stablized the academic staff increased further (Table 6). As in
the case of the lower educational levels,

the impact was absorbed with an

elastic response, and improvement occurred after the pressure subsided,
when inputs continued their growth.
It should be noted that the activities described here may have not
exhausted the adjustment. Thus, we know that there was an increase in
emigration after the 1973 war (Lamdany, 1983). It may well be that

extended periods of absence from the countrybefore

entering the labor

market or university served as a buffer.
In the U.S. between 1960 and 1970 the size of the age group 16—19
increased by 44 percent, the number of employed increased by 11 percent;
the age group 20—24 increased by 49 percent and employment by 26 percent.
The educational system absorbed much of the excess, but the armed forces

were also a significant factor (see Office of Science and Technology,
1983, pp. 50—51).

V. CONTEXT

Before we explore whether the baby boom had any impact on the labor
market, we have to clarify the demographic and economic context in which
the change took place.

19

Immigration: We have already noted the large and fluctuating waves of
immigration. In Table 7 we break down the sources of growth in the
population of Jewish men aged 20—64. We see how the contribution of the
young, both Israel—born and foreign—born (lines 4 and 5), to the growth of
the adult population rises abruptly between 1965 and 1970, while net
immigration falls steeply and the more mature foreign—born grow older. The
contribution of the Israel—born to the adult population increases over
time and becomes dominant in the 1970s. The foreign—born contribution
occurs first through immigration, then the weight shifts to the maturation
of the foreign—born young, reaching a peak in 1965—70 when the foreign—
born baby boom generation comes in. But at the same time growing numbers
exit from the 20—64 category, so that in the 1970s the process of
maturation of the foreign—born contributes negatively to the growth of the
adult population: as net immigration slows down in the late 1970s, the
foreign—born reduce rather than increase the adult population, offsetting
part of the very high increase in the Israeli—born. The successive 5 years
of growth of the 20—64 age group are less volatile than the rates of
change for the total population.

The context of large and changing immigration has broader
implications. It means that the system is accustomed to shocks, that the
public sector has always had to rapidly alter the level of services that
it provides, and that the way it copes with the variety of social issues
raised by immigration was a primary criterion by which it was judged.

Women: In assessing the impact on the labor force of the entry of larger
cohorts of young persons it is important to note that at the same time
there has been a change in women's employment.

20

As in many other countries, the period under review was one of
significant increase in the labor force participation of women. When we
examine men alone, the share of men aged 18—34 in the change of all
employed men rises sharply after 1965, from approximately 1/7 to between

2/3 and 1.0 (Table 8 line 1). For both sexes the change is quite sharp
(line 3) after 1965, but more moderate than for men alone because in the
case of women there was significant increase in the number of women aged
25—44. Because of the jump from 1/3 to 2/3 in the share of women in the
increase in employment after 1965 (line 5), the contribution of young men
to the change in overall employment rises much more moderately than their
contribution to the rise in men's employment (line 6). We see in Table 8
that while all women and young men contributed less than half of the net
increase in the change in employment before 1965, they contributed 85—100
percent of the change in 1965—80. At the same time the proportion of men
aged 35—54 in employment has declined.
Whether the influx of women aggravated or alleviated the position of
young men depends on whether they are substitutes or complements in the
labor force. Do young men compete with young women? With all women? The
ratio of young men to young women and to all women decline dramatically
through the 1970s while the relative hourly earnings of young men and
young women did not change. As the difference in schooling between men and

women both aged 25—34 in the labor force has not changed from 1970 to
1980, a high degree of substitution is suggested.5

Arabs from the occupied territories. A direct consequence of the 1967 war
was the occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and the entry of
Arab labor from these territories into the Israeli labor market,
increasing the supply of unskilled, manual labor. Again, this effect could

21

go either way —

the obvious substitution with unskilled domestic
labor, or

a complementary effect opening opportunities for low—level supervisory and
middlemen positions for Jews. Amir (1981), who studied the changing
returns to education, tends to argue that the effect
that the unskilled Arab labor improved the

was positive, i.e.,

opportunities among Jews for

domestic low— and medium—schooling labor.

The macroeconomic picture. Israel experienced a continuous period of
rapid economic growth until 1965. This
in 1965—67, with considerable
particularly hard —

was interrupted by a deep recession

unemployment. The young were hit

the rate of unemployment of men aged 18—24
rose from

10.7 in 1965 to 22.5 percent in

1967, and for men aged 25—34 from 2.8 to

7.8; the rate for men aged 45—54 rose from 1.1 to 4.9. The combination of
continued slump and influx into the labor force of the young workers could
have been disastrous. But, following the 1967 war the country
experienced

a resumption of rapid growth until 1973. This created an environment that
certainly eased the entry of new young cohorts into the labor force.
Following the 1973 war and the energy crisis Israel was gripped by
stagflation. With rising rates of unemployment towards the end of the
decade. The deterioration in the relative position of the
young in the
late l970s might reflect this change.

When we examine the impact on the labor market of a
sudden change in cohort size our main concern is with the elasticities
of
substitution which reflect the

uniqueness of particular types of labor. At

the same time, unemployment rates are also of interest,
the identification of short—term

particularly for

difficulties (see Welch, 1979, 1983;

22

Freeman, 1979; and Wachter, 1976). In addition, some groups tend to be
more sensitive than others to cyclical variations.
The delay in the entry of people aged 20—24 into the labor force was
important enough in itself, but eventually it had its impact on the age
composition of the labor force once these people did enter it. In Table 5,
Part I, we see that from 1965 to 1970 the share of those aged 20—24 in the
population increased by 4.7 percentage points (p.p.) while their share in
employment rose by only 1.3 p.p. In 1970—80, however, the change in the
population share of the 25—34 age group was 7.5 p.p., and among the
employed it was 9.8 p.p.

As is well demonstrated in Table 9, the relative earnings of young
men declined sharply during the 1970s. The relative earnings of men aged
25—34 and women aged 18—24 declined more moderately. The relative earnings
of older people declined too (sharply for women). The relative number of
men aged 18—24 did not increase and the relative number of young women
actually declined sharply. It is the 25—34 group and older men whose

numbers increased sharply during this period, which probably affected the
relative earnings of young men.

Obviously, we have a change in the profile of earnings. This has been
confirmed in a comparative cross section study by Amir (1983) who
estimated earnings functions for 1970—72 and 1978—80 within education

categories and showed that the positive linear coefficient on experience
and negative coefficient on experience squared both increased in absolute
terms. The question is: what caused that change, and specifically, is it
related to the change in the size of the age groups.
The series of regression equations presented in Table 10 reveal the
following:

23

First, the relative earnings of young cohorts are adversely affected
by increases in the general level of unemployment (represented by the rate
of unemployment of men aged 35—54).

Second, young men's relative earnings are adversely affected by
increases in their own share in total employment as well as by the
increases in the share of other groups — young women and older men and
women. This indicates a fair amount of substitution between these groups.

Welch (1983), studying U.S. data, also found that the relative wages of
the young react to the proportion of the old. Indeed, fairly good results
are obtained when we run relative wages on the proportion of young people
of both sexes, and also the proportion in employment of the elderly (65+)
of both sexes. It is hard to separate out the effect of different
demographic groups when the variables appear simultaneously, but when they

appear separately, the reaction of the young men's relative earnings to
changes in the proportion of young women or older men are certainly no
smaller than to their own numbers.

Third, the age group 18—24 responds adversely to the size of the
whole group aged 18—34 rather than to its own size.
Fourth, the response of relative earnings of men aged 25—34 to
changes in its share in employment is somewhat weaker than that of the 18—
34 age group.

Similar results have been obtained when the dependent variable is
hourly rather than annual earnings and where instead of the ratios of the
age groups in employment we used as independent variables their ratios in
the labor force and (alternatively) in the population both as independent
variables and as instrumental variables (see regressions No. 4 and No. 11
in Table 10).

24

The age group 18—24 seems to have suffered in relative terms not when
it was at its peak size but at the end of the decade, when it was smaller
and when the whole 18—34 group was at peak size. This means that the
vanguard of the larger cohort (aged 18—24 in the beginning of the 1970s),
most of whom were the 25—34 category in 1980, suffered much less than the
following (somewhat smaller) class that found the entry positions in the
labor market crowded with the very large 25—34 cohort.
The data for the labor force extend over longer periods. For the
period

1955—80 there is a significant negative correlation between the

employment rate of persons aged 18—34 (the ratio of employed to
population)

and the share of that age group in the population. For the

period 1965—80 we can distinguish between age groups 18—24 and 25—34,
finding large negative correlations for the latter. For the period 1965—80
we find that the rate of unemployment of the 25—34 age group (relative to
age 35—54) is positively correlated with its share in the population and
in the labor force, and negatively related to its rate of labor force
participation. Several regressions show that the unemployment of the young
rises more in absolute terms and less in relative terms than the rate of
unemployment of men aged 35—54. In different variations it is also
positively associated with the relative weight of the young (18—34) and of
the old (65+) in the labor force (Table 11).

In principle, the change in the age structure could have affected
demand. Some indication of this is seen in the regressions where the
proportion of the population aged 20—29 has a significant effect on
investment in dwelling.6 But it is quite clear that the net effect is
supply effect.

25

CONCLUS IONS

The entry of large cohorts into the labor market affected both relative
wages and unemployment. What merits attention is the larger role that the
government played in meeting the baby boom. This was demonstrated here by
following the evolution of the school system as it coped with the uneven
arrival of students at different levels. The entry of the large cohorts
into the labor market was delayed because of the expansion of the army,

another silent role of government. We presented some tentative ideas on
what could explain the behavior of the public sector, suggesting that
governments may be keen on responding quickly to big shocks, but unable to
adjust downward once the pressure subsides. Whatever the correct model, it
is important to unravel the role of the public sector and to pay more
attention to its behavior.

not include children born to EA women after immigration. While the
figures are also affected by the selectivity of immigrants by age and
family status, the large 0—4 group relative to the 5—9 group most
likely reflects the effect of the war.
