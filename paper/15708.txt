ABSTRACT
Do bankrupt firms impose negative externalities on their non-bankrupt competitors? We propose and
analyze a collateral channel in which a firm’s bankruptcy reduces collateral values of other industry
participants, thereby increasing the cost of external debt finance industry wide. To identify this collateral
channel, we use a novel dataset of secured debt tranches issued by U.S. airlines which includes a detailed
description of the underlying assets serving as collateral. Our estimates suggest that industry bankruptcies
have a sizeable impact on the cost of debt financing of other industry participants. We discuss how
the collateral channel may lead to contagion effects which amplify the business cycle during industry
downturns.

Introduction
Do bankrupt ﬁrms aﬀect their solvent non-bankrupt competitors? While there is a large body of
research studying the consequences of bankruptcy reorganizations and liquidations for those ﬁrms
that actually ﬁle for court protection (e.g. Asquith et al. (1994), Hotchkiss (1995), and Strömberg
(2000)), little is known about the externalities that bankrupt ﬁrms impose on other ﬁrms operating
in the same industry. Any such externalities would be of particular concern, as they may give rise to
self reinforcing feedback loops that amplify the business cycle during industry downturns. Indeed,
the potential for contagion eﬀects has been of particular concern in the ongoing ﬁnancial panic of
2007-2009 where insolvent bank liquidations and asset sell oﬀs impose ‘ﬁre-sale’ externalities on the
economy at large (see e.g. Kashyap et al. (2008)).
In this paper we identify one channel in which bankrupt ﬁrms, through their impact on collateral
values, impose negative externalities on non-bankrupt competitors. We use the term ‘collateral
channel’ to describe this eﬀect. According to the collateral channel, a ﬁrm’s bankruptcy reduces
collateral values of other industry participants, particularly when the market for assets is relatively
illiquid. Since collateral plays an important role in raising debt ﬁnance, this reduction in collateral
values will increase the cost and reduce the availability of external ﬁnance across the entire industry.
Theory provides two interrelated reasons for the prediction that bankruptcy of industry participants lowers collateral values of other industry participants. First, a ﬁrm’s bankruptcy and the
resultant increased likelihood of asset sales will place downward pressure on the value of similar
assets, particularly when there are frictions in this secondary market. For example, in an illiquid
market, bankruptcy induced sales of assets will create a disparity of supply over demand, causing
asset prices to decline, at least temporarily. In the context of real estate markets, whose collapse
was of crucial importance in instigating and magnifying the crisis, Campbell et al. (2009) provide
evidence of spillover eﬀects in which house foreclosures reduce the price of other houses located in
the same area.
The second reason that bankruptcies will tend to reduce collateral values is their impact on the
demand for assets. When a ﬁrm is in ﬁnancial distress, its demand for industry assets will likely
diminish, as the ﬁrm does not have, and cannot easily raise, the funding which would be required
to purchase industry assets (Shleifer and Vishny, (1992), Kiyotaki and Moore, (1997)). Thus,
bankruptcies and ﬁnancial distress reduce demand for industry assets, again placing downward

1

pressure on the value of collateral. Reductions in demand for assets driven by bankruptcies and
ﬁnancial distress are currently evident in the diﬃculties the FDIC is encountering in selling failed
banks. These diﬃculties have arisen because traditional buyers of failed banks – namely, other
banks – are ﬁnancially weak.1
Thus, both due to increased supply and reduced demand for industry assets, the collateral
channel implies that bankruptcies increase the likelihood of asset ﬁre sales, reducing collateral
values industry wide. This weakens the balance sheet of non-bankrupt ﬁrms, thereby raising their
cost of debt capital.
Empirically, a number of important outcomes have been shown to be sensitive to the announcement of bankruptcy of industry competitors. For example, Lang and Stulz (1992) show that when
a ﬁrm declares bankruptcy, on average, competitor ﬁrm stock prices react negatively. Likewise,
Hertzel and Oﬃcer (2008) and Jorion and Zhang (2007) examine the eﬀect of bankruptcy on competitors’ loan yields and CDS spreads. However, identifying a causal link from the ﬁnancial distress
or bankruptcy ﬁlings of some players in an industry to their solvent non-bankrupt competitors is
diﬃcult since bankruptcy ﬁlings and ﬁnancial distress are potentially correlated with the state of
the industry. Financial distress and bankruptcy ﬁlings themselves thus convey industry speciﬁc
information, explaining, for example, negative industry wide stock price reactions and loan pricing
eﬀects. The question, therefore, remains: do bankrupt ﬁrms aﬀect their competitors in a causal
manner or do the observed adverse eﬀects merely reﬂect changes in the economic environment faced
by the industry at large?
Using a novel dataset of secured debt tranches issued by U.S. airlines, we provide empirical
support for the collateral channel. Airlines in the U.S. issue tranches of secured debt known as
Equipment Trust Certiﬁcates (ETCs), Enhanced Equipment Trust Securities (EETCs), and Pass
Through Certiﬁcates (PTCs). We construct a sample of aircraft tranche issues and then obtain
the serial number of all aircraft that were pledged as collateral. For each of the debt tranches
in our sample we can identify precisely its underlying collateral. We then identify the ‘collateral
channel’ oﬀ of both the time-series variation of bankruptcy ﬁlings by airlines, and the cross-sectional
variation in the overlap between the aircraft types in the collateral of a speciﬁc debt tranche and
the aircraft types operated by bankrupt airlines. The richness of our data – which includes detailed

funds, to infuse fresh capital into the banking system and purchase failed ﬁnancial institutions. See “New Rules

information on tranches’ underlying collateral and airlines’ ﬂeets – combined with the fairly large
number of airline bankruptcies in our sample period, allows us to identify strategic externalities
that are likely driven by a collateral channel rather than by an industry shock to the economic
environment.
At heart, our identiﬁcation strategy relies on analyzing the diﬀerential impact of an airline’s
bankruptcy on the credit spread of tranches which are secured by aircraft of diﬀerent model types.
According to the collateral channel hypothesis, tranches whose underlying collateral are of model
types which have a large amount of overlap with the ﬂeet of the bankrupt airline, should exhibit
larger price declines than tranches whose collateral has only little overlap with the bankrupt airline’s
ﬂeet.
For each tranche in our sample we construct two measures of bankruptcy induced collateral
shocks. The ﬁrst measure tracks the evolution over time of the number of airlines in bankruptcy
operating aircraft of the same model types as those serving as collateral for the tranche. Since
airlines tend to acquire aircraft of the same model types which they already operate, an increase in
the ﬁrst measure is associated with a reduction in the number of potential buyers of the underlying
tranche collateral. The second measure of collateral shocks tracks the number of aircraft operated
by bankrupt airlines of the same model type as those serving as tranche collateral. An increase in
this second measure is associated with a greater supply of aircraft on the market similar to those
serving as tranche collateral. Increases in either of these two measures, therefore, tend to decrease
the value of tranche collateral and hence increase credit spreads.
Using both measures, we ﬁnd that bankruptcy-induced collateral shocks are indeed associated
with lower tranche spreads. For example, our univariate tests show that the mean spread of tranches
with no potential buyers in bankruptcy is 208 basis points, while the mean spread of tranches with
at least one potential buyer in bankruptcy is 339 basis points. Moreover, our regression analysis
shows that the results are robust to a battery of airline and tranche controls, as well as airline,
tranche and year ﬁxed-eﬀects.
We continue by showing that the eﬀect of bankruptcy-induced collateral shocks on credit spreads
is higher for less-senior tranches and tranches with higher loan-to-value. Further, we ﬁnd that credit
spreads of less proﬁtable airlines display higher sensitivity to collateral shocks. Finally, using a host
of robustness tests and analysis we show that our results are not driven by underlying industry
conditions, or by other forms of potential contagion unrelated to the collateral channel.

analysis and explains our identiﬁcation methodology. Section 2 provides the institutional details on
the market for Equipment Trust Certiﬁcates and Enhanced Equipment Trust Certiﬁcates. Section

relation between bankruptcy-induced collateral shocks and credit spreads. Section 5 concludes.

1.

Theory and Identification Strategy

Bankrupt ﬁrms may inﬂict indirect costs of ﬁnancial distress on their non-bankrupt competitors,
for example, by deterring customers and suppliers from dealing with ﬁrms in the same industry.
However, the fact that non-bankrupt ﬁrms within the industry exhibit contemporaneous negative
reactions might merely reﬂect a deteriorating economic environment. Lang and Stulz (1992) were
the ﬁrst to point to the empirical problem in identifying a causal contagious eﬀect of bankruptcy.
They write:
An oft-repeated concern is that bankruptcy is contagious within an industry. The common view is that one ﬁrm’s bankruptcy makes customers and suppliers wary of the other
ﬁrms in the same industry irrespective of their economic health and hence makes them
worse oﬀ. An alternative, more benign, view of contagion is that the bankruptcy announcement reveals negative information about the components of cash ﬂows that are
common to all ﬁrms in the industry and, consequently, decreases the market’s expectation of the proﬁtability of the industry’s ﬁrms. From an empirical perspective, it is
diﬃcult to distinguish between these two views of contagion, but they have strongly different implication for public policy. If contagion is only an information eﬀect, it has no
social costs.
Several papers study intra-industry contagion eﬀects of bankruptcy. Bernanke (1983) ﬁnds contagion eﬀects during the great depression, while Warner (1977) ﬁnds no contagion in the railroad
industry during the early 20th century. Lang and Stulz (1992) investigate the eﬀect of bankruptcy
announcements on equity values on the bankrupt ﬁrm’s competitors. They ﬁnd that bankruptcy
announcements decrease the value of competitors in highly levered industries, while the eﬀect is
positive in highly concentrated industries with low leverage, suggesting that in these industries
competitors beneﬁt from the ﬁnancial diﬃculties of bankrupt ﬁrms. Hertzel and Oﬃcer (2008)
4

ﬁnd that spreads on corporate loans are higher when the loan originates or is renegotiated during
times in which industry rivals ﬁle for bankruptcy. Similar to Lang and Stulz (1992), they ﬁnd
that contagion in loan spreads is mitigated in concentrated industries. Likewise, Jorion and Zhang
(2007) ﬁnd evidence that is consistent with the contagion eﬀect of bankruptcy using credit default
swaps data.2
While making important contributions and advancing the knowledge about the empirical regularities in the data, none of these papers identify the direction of the causality from bankruptcy
to industry contagion. Is bankruptcy contagious or benign? Moreover, the evidence in these paper
does not pin down the mechanism through which bankruptcy aﬀect competitors.
In this paper, we identify one channel, which we call the ‘collateral channel’, through which
bankrupt ﬁrms impose negative externalities on their non-bankrupt competitors. In this collateral
channel, a bankruptcy of an industry participant serves to lower the value of similar collateral
industry wide. This occurs for two reasons. First, a ﬁrm’s bankruptcy and the resultant increased
likelihood of the sale of all or a fraction of its assets will place downward pressure on the value
of similar assets, particularly when there are frictions in this secondary market.3 Second, when
a ﬁrm is in ﬁnancial distress its demand for industry assets will likely diminish since it does not
have, and can not easily raise, capital to purchase industry assets (Shleifer and Vishny (1992)).
Since collateral plays an important role in raising debt ﬁnancing, the reduction in collateral values
associated with a ﬁrm’s bankruptcy will increase the cost and reduce the availability of external debt
ﬁnance. The collateral channel therefore implies that bankruptcies impose a negative externality
on other industry participants through their impact on the value of collateral.
To analyze this collateral channel we focus on a single industry – airlines – and employ a unique
identiﬁcation strategy. This strategy involves utilizing information on collateral characteristics,
collateral pricing, and the timing of airline bankruptcies in the following manner. Airlines in the
U.S. issue tranches of secured debt to ﬁnance their operations. The debt is secured by a pool of
aircraft serving as collateral. Using ﬁling prospectuses, we identify the model type of all aircraft
serving as collateral in each pool. For each tranche we obtain a time series of prices and obtain the
2

In related literature, Chevalier and Scharfstein (1995, 1996) and Phillips (1995) examine a contagion eﬀect from
ﬁrms in ﬁnancial distress to other industry participants through a product market pricing channel. They show that
liquidity constrained ﬁrms – as proxied by those that undertook leveraged buyouts – tended to increase their product
prices.

et al. (2007) who show that recovery rates are lower when an industry is in distress.

dates and durations of all bankruptcy ﬁlings of airlines in the U.S. during the years 1994-2007.4
At heart, our identiﬁcation strategy relies on analyzing the diﬀerential impact of an airline’s
bankruptcy on the price of tranches which are secured by aircraft of diﬀerent model types. The
collateral channel hypothesis predicts that tranches whose underlying collateral are of model types
which have a large degree of overlap with the ﬂeet of the bankrupt airline should exhibit larger
price declines than tranches whose collateral has little overlap with the bankrupt airline’s ﬂeet. As
explained above, an airline’s bankruptcy and the increased likelihood of the sale of part or all of
the airline’s ﬂeet will place downward pressure on the value of aircraft of the same model type.
Furthermore, as in Shleifer and Vishny (1992), since demand for a given aircraft model type stems
to a large extent from airlines who already operate that model type, an airline’s ﬁnancial distress
and bankruptcy will reduce demand for the types of aircraft it operates in its ﬂeet. For these two
reasons – both increased supply of aircraft in the used market and reduced demand for certain
aircraft – tranches secured by aircraft of model types exhibiting larger overlaps with the model
types of the bankrupt airline’s ﬂeet should experience larger price declines.
By utilizing variation in the ﬂeets of airlines going bankrupt and their degree of overlap with
the type of aircraft serving as collateral for secured debt of other airlines, we can thus identify a
collateral channel through which one ﬁrm’s bankruptcy aﬀects other ﬁrms in the same industry.
Since we rely on the diﬀerential impact of bankruptcy on credit spreads of tranches secured by
aircraft of diﬀerent model types within an airline, this identiﬁcation strategy alleviates concerns
that the results are driven by an information channel eﬀect in which bankruptcies convey negative
information common to all ﬁrms in the industry. Moreover, we test our evidence for the collateral
channel against alternative contagion-based explanations. For example, we show that are results
are not driven by contagion through credit enhancers or through holders of tranche securities.
In the next section we describe in further detail the debt instruments used by airlines to issue
secured debt and their development over time.

Airline Equipment Trust Certificates

ETCs and EETCs are aircraft asset-backed securities (ABS) that have been used since the early
1990s to ﬁnance the acquisitions of new aircraft.5 Aircraft ABSs are subject to Section 1110
4

We do not observe transaction prices of aircraft.
Our discussion here draws heavily from Littlejohns and McGairl (1998), Morrell (2001), and Benmelech and
Bergman (2008a) who provide an extensive description of the market for airline equipment trust certiﬁcates and its
5

6

protection which provided relief from the automatic stay of assets in bankruptcy to creditors holding
a secured interest in aircraft, strengthening the creditor rights of the holders of these securities.
In a traditional ETC, a trustee issues equipment trust certiﬁcates to investors and uses the
proceeds to buy the aircraft which is then leased to the airline. Lease payments are then used
to pay principal and interest on the certiﬁcates. The collateral of ETCs typically included only
one or two aircraft. For example, on August 24, 1990, American Airlines issued an Equipment
Trust Certiﬁcate (1990 Equipment Trust Certiﬁcates, Series P) maturing on March 4, 2014. The
certiﬁcates were issued to ﬁnance approximately 77% of the equipment cost of one Boeing 757223 (serial number 24583) passenger aircraft, including engines (Rolls-Royce RB211-535E4B). The
proceeds from the ETC issue were $35.5 million, with a serial interest rate of 10.36% and a credit
rating of A (S&P) and A1 (Moody’s).
Increasing issuance costs led to the development of Pass-Through certiﬁcates which pooled a
number of ETCs into a single security which was then backed by a pool of aircraft rather than just
one. While Pass-Through certiﬁcates increased diversiﬁcation and reduced exposure to a single
aircraft, the airline industry downturn in the early 1990s led to downgrades of many ETCs and
PTCs to below investment grade and subsequently to a narrowed investor base.
During the mid 1990s ETCs and PTCs were further modiﬁed into EETCs – Enhanced Equipment Trust Certiﬁcates – which soon became the leading source of external ﬁnance of aircraft.
EETC securitization have three main advantages compared to traditional ETCs and PTCs. First,
EETCs have larger collateral pools with more than one aircraft type, making them more diversiﬁed.
Second, EETCs typically have several tranches with diﬀerent seniority. Third, a liquidity facility,
provided by a third party such as Morgan Stanley Capital Services, ensures the continued payment
of interest on the certiﬁcates for a predetermined period following a default, typically for a period of
up to 18 months. EETC securitization therefore enhances the creditworthiness of traditional ETCs
and PTCs by reducing the bankruptcy risk, tranching the cash ﬂows, and providing temporary
liquidity in the event of default.
Because of the varying loan-to-values, credit ratings, and yields associated with diﬀerent tranches
of EETCs, they are purchased by both investment grade and high yield institutional investors.
These include insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds and money managers. While the market for EETCs is not as liquid as that for corporate bonds, it is more liquid
historical evolution.

than the market for bank loans.6
Table 1 presents the characteristics and structures of three EETC issues in our sample. There
are several tranches in each of the EETCs in Table 1. For each tranche we report the issue size
(in $ million), yield, spreads (in basis points), ﬁnal maturity date, Moody’s and S&P tranchespeciﬁc credit rating, cumulative loan-to-value, and collateral description. For example, in the
ﬁrst EETC in the table (Fedex 1998-1), the most senior tranche (1-A) has a credit rating of
Aa2/AAA, a cumulative loan-to-value ratio of 38.7%, and a credit spread of 125 basis points over
the corresponding treasury. The least senior tranche in the Fedex 1998-1 issue (1-C) has a lower
credit rating (Baa1/BBB+), a higher cumulative loan-to-value ratio (68.8%), and a credit spread
of 155 basis points. All three tranches of Fedex 1998-1 are secured by the same pool of assets – 5
McDonnell Douglas MD-11F and 8 Airbus A300F4-605R.

Data and Summary Statistics

3.1.

Sample Construction

We use SDC platinum to identify all secured tranches, Equipment Trust Certiﬁcates, Pass-Through
Certiﬁcates, and Enhanced Equipment Trust Certiﬁcates issued by ﬁrms with four digit SIC codes
4512 (Scheduled Air Transportation), 4513 (Air Courier Services), and 4522 (Nonscheduled Air
Transport) between January 1990 and December 2005. This results in 235 debt tranches issued
in U.S. public markets. We collect data on tranche characteristics (i.e., issue size, seniority, ﬁnal
maturity, and whether the tranche is callable) from SDC platinum.
We supplement the SDC data with information collected from tranche ﬁling prospectus obtained
in EDGAR Plus (R) and Compact Disclosure. For each tranche, we obtain the serial number of
all aircraft that were pledged as collateral from the ﬁling prospectus. We are able to ﬁnd full
information about the aircraft collateral securing the issues for 198 public tranches. We match each
aircraft serial number to the Ascend CASE airline database, which contains ownership information,
operating information and information on aircraft characteristics for every commercial aircraft in
the world.
We obtain tranche transactions data from the Fixed-Income Securities Database (FISD) compiled by Mergent, which is considered to be the most comprehensive source of bond prices.7 The
6
7

See Mann (2009).
See Korteweg (2007) for a detailed description of the Mergent data.

8

National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) requires insurance companies to ﬁle all
their trades in bonds with the NAIC. All transactions in our dataset, therefore, represent trades
where at least one party was an insurance company.
Each observation of a transaction provides the ﬂat price at which the transaction was made.
We convert these prices into spreads by calculating the appropriate yield to maturity at the date
of transaction, and then subtracting the yield of the duration matched Treasury.8 For better
comparability across tranches, we exclude from our sample tranches which were issued as ﬂoating
rate debt.
We match each tranche transaction to the relevant airline’s previous year’s characteristics (i.e.
size, market-to-book, proﬁtability, and leverage) using Compustat data. Finally, we use Thomson’s
SDC Platinum Restructuring database to identify airlines that are in Chapter 7 or Chapter 11
bankruptcy procedures. Our ﬁnal sample consists of 18,327 transactions in 127 individual tranches,
representing 12 airlines during the period 1/1/1994 to 12/31/2007.

3.2.

Tranche and Airline Characteristics

Panel A of Table 2 provides summary statistics for the 127 tranches in our sample. Summary statistics are calculated over the entire sample and are therefore weighted by the number of transaction
observations per tranche. Throughout our analysis we use the tranche spread as our dependent
variable. As Panel A shows, the mean tranche spread is 290.2 basis points and the standard deviation is 311 basis points. The mean tranche size in our sample is $274.4 million, with an average
term-to-maturity of 16.9 years. There are at most 4 diﬀerent layers of tranche seniority within
an issue (where seniority=1 for most senior tranches and 4 for most junior). Further, as Panel A
shows, 68% of the tranches in our sample are amortized, while 75% of the tranches in our sample
have a liquidity facility – a feature common in Enhanced Equipment Trust Certiﬁcates. Finally,
the average tranche loan-to-value ratio at time of issue is 0.54, ranging between 0.33 and 0.89.
Panel B of Table 2 provides summary statistics for the issuing airlines. The size of the average
airline in our sample, measured as the book value of assets, is $14.2 billion. The average airline
market to book ratio is 1.26, while their average proﬁtability and leverage are 8.24% and 37%,
respectively.9
8

To calculate tranche yields, we distinguish between tranches that are amortized and those that have a balloon
payment at maturity. This data is collected by reading the prospectuses of each issue.

Appendix B provides description of construction and data sources for all variables used in the paper.

9

As in Benmelech and Bergman (2008 and 2009) and Gavazza (2008), we measure the redeployability of aircraft by exploiting aircraft model heterogeneity.10 The redeployability measures are
based on the fact that airlines tend to operate a limited number of aircraft models, implying that
potential secondary market buyers of any given type of aircraft are likely to be airlines already operating the same type of aircraft. Redeployability is, therefore, proxied by the number of potential
buyers and the ‘popularity’ of an aircraft model type.
Using the Ascend CASE database, we construct two redeployability measures in the following
manner. For every aircraft type and sample-year we compute 1) the number of non-bankrupt
operators ﬂying that aircraft model type; and 2) the number of aircraft of that type used by
non-bankrupt operators. This process yields two redeployability measures for each aircraft-type
and each sample-year. To construct the redeployability measures for a portfolio of aircraft serving
as collateral for a particular tranche, we calculate the weighted average of each redeployability
measure across all aircraft in the collateral portfolio. For weights in this calculation, we use the
number of seats in an aircraft model type – a common proxy for aircraft size (and value). Panel
C of Table 2 provides descriptive statistics for our two redeployability measures. As can be seen,
the redeployability measure based on number of aircraft has an average value of 1,392.9 aircraft.
Furthermore, on average, there are 135.9 potential buyers for aircraft serving as collateral for
secured tranche issue.
Finally, we add additional variables that capture the health of the airline industry. These
variables are jet fuel price, number of bankrupt airlines, number of non-bankrupt or healthy airlines,
The book value of bankrupt airlines divided by the book value of all airlines, as well as the book
value of non-bankrupt airlines divided by the book value of all airlines. Panel D report summary
statistics for each of these variables.

3.3.

Identifying Bankruptcy Shocks

We construct two measures of shocks to collateral driven by airlines entering bankruptcy. For each
aircraft type and calendar day in our sample we calculate (1) the number of airlines operating that
particular model type which are in bankruptcy, Bankrupt Buyers; and (2) the number of aircraft of
that particular type which are operated by airlines in bankruptcy, Bankrupt Aircraf t.11 Increases
10
11

Appendix A provides a detailed description of the construction of this redeployability measure.
We calculate these measures using beginning and end dates of airline bankruptcies in the U.S. from SDC Platinum.

10

in the ﬁrst measure capture reductions in demand for a given model type, as airlines tend to
purchase aircraft of model types that they already operate. Increases in the second measure are
associated with an increase in the supply of a given aircraft model type likely to be sold in the
market as bankrupt airlines liquidate part or all of their ﬂeets. Since changes in aircraft ownership
are relatively infrequent, ownership information of aircraft is updated at a yearly rather than daily
frequency. However, the two measures may change at a daily frequency due to airlines entering or
exiting bankruptcy. In Appendix A, ﬁgures A1 and A2 provide a timeline of airline bankruptcies
in the United States and the total number of aircraft operated by bankrupt US airlines over the
sample period.
Figures 1 and 2 provide a graphic illustration of the two measures for the Boeing 737 and
Boeing 747 model types. For each model type, the ﬁgures thus show the evolution over time of the
number of operators in bankruptcy operating each of these models, as well as the number of aircraft
operated by bankrupt airlines. The ﬁgures clearly show the deterioration of industry conditions in
the latter part of the sample period. Further, while there are some commonalities in the trends
between the model types, there are also large diﬀerences between model types in both measures.
Thus, for example, while the number of bankrupt B747 aircraft increased during the ﬁrst part of
2004, the number of bankrupt B737 aircraft decreased during this period. This variation between
model types stems from bankruptcies of airlines operating diﬀerent ﬂeets composed of diﬀerent
model types. As discussed in section 1, it is this variation, and the diﬀerences in the types of
aircraft used as collateral, which enables identiﬁcation of the collateral channel.
To construct the two bankruptcy measures for a portfolio of aircraft serving as collateral for
a particular tranche, we calculate the weighted average of the aircraft type measures across all
aircraft in the portfolio, using the number of seats in each aircraft as weights.
Panel A of Table 3 provides summary statistics for the two measures, Panels B and C display
the evolution of the bankrupt buyers and bankrupt aircraft measures over time. As can be seen,
over the entire sample period, the average value of Bankrupt Buyers was 0.809 indicating that
the average aircraft in a tranche had 0.809 potential buyers that were in bankruptcy. Similarly,
the average value of Bankrupt Aircraf t was 43.86 aircraft indicating that their were 43.86 aircraft
operated by bankrupt airlines of the same model type as the average aircraft serving as collateral
in a debt tranche.

Empirical Analysis

4.1.

Univariate Analysis

As an initial step, it is instructive to conduct the analysis using simple comparison-of-means tests.
Panel A of Table 4 displays average tranche credit spreads of both bankrupt and non-bankrupt
airlines. There are 1,011 transactions in 43 tranches of four bankrupt airlines. As would be
expected, credit spreads of tranches issued by airlines that are currently in bankruptcy are higher
than spreads of solvent airlines. The mean credit spread of a bankrupt airline is 531.7 basis points
compared to a mean tranche spread of 276.1 basis points for non-bankrupt airlines (t-statistic for
an equal means test=2.81).
As a ﬁrst, simple test of the credit chanel, we focus only on airlines that are not in bankruptcy,
and split this sub-sample between airlines with ﬂeets that do not have any bankrupt potential
buyer, and airlines with at least one bankrupt potential buyer for their ﬂeet. As described in the
previous section, an airline is considered to be a potential buyer of a particular aircraft if in its
ﬂeet it operates aircraft of the same model type. Focusing only on non-bankrupt ﬁrms ensures that
credit spreads are not contaminated by the direct association of bankruptcy and credit spreads.
Out of the 17,316 transactions in non-bankrupt airlines tranches there are 8,324 transactions
with no bankrupt potential collateral buyers, and 8,992 transactions with at least one bankrupt
potential collateral buyers. Panel B of Table 4 compares credit spreads of tranches that do not have
any bankrupt potential buyers, and tranches with at least some bankrupt potential buyers for their
pledged collateral. As can be seen in the table, the mean tranche credit spreads of a non-bankrupt
airline that has no bankrupt buyers is 208.0 basis points compared to a mean tranche spread of
339.0 basis points for non-bankrupt airlines with some bankrupt potential buyers (t-statistic for an
equal means test=7.48). Thus, consistent with a collateral channel, tranches of airlines secured by
collateral with potential buyers that are in bankruptcy have a lower value than tranches where all
potential buyers are not in bankruptcy.
While still focusing only on non-bankrupt airlines, Panel C of Table 4 reﬁnes the analysis in
Panel B by conditioning the credit spread diﬀerential on tranche seniority levels. We conjecture that
the collateral eﬀect will be larger in more junior tranches due to their higher sensitivity to the value
of the underlying collateral. Panel C splits the sample to four levels of seniority (1=most senior
4=most junior), and compares the mean credit spread between tranches with no bankrupt potential

12

buyers and tranches with some bankrupt potential buyers for each of the seniority levels. The ﬁrst
four columns of the panel report credit spreads and number of observations in each category (in
parentheses), as well as t-tests for an equal means test across and within seniority levels.
As Panel C of Table 4 demonstrates, the diﬀerence between credit spreads of tranches with and
without bankrupt potential buyers is the highest among the most junior tranches, and monotonically
decreases with tranche seniority. For the most senior tranches the spread diﬀerence is 95.0 basis
points, while the diﬀerences for seniority levels 2 and 3 (i.e mezzanine seniority) are 195.5 basis
points and 297.4 basis points, respectively. Finally, among the most junior tranches the spread
diﬀerential is much higher and equals 1112.9 basis points. All diﬀerences are statistically signiﬁcant
at the one percent level.
In the last three columns of Panel C of Table 4 we use a diﬀerences-in-diﬀerences approach.
In each of these columns we report the diﬀerence between the means of credit spreads of tranches
with diﬀerent seniority (1 vs. 2, 1 vs. 3, and 1 vs. 4) and the corresponding t-values for equal
means test. These diﬀerences in seniority-based credit spreads are reported separately for tranches
with bankrupt potential buyers for their underlying collateral and for tranches without bankrupt
potential buyers. As can be seen in the table, we ﬁnd that the seniority-diﬀerential in spreads is
much higher for tranches with some bankrupt potential buyers. As the last column of Panel C
demonstrates, among tranches with no bankrupt potential buyer, the spread diﬀerential between
most and least senior tranches is a statistically signiﬁcant 124.5 basis points. In contrast, moving
from most senior to most junior tranches with some bankrupt potential buyers is associated with
a spread increase of a statistically signiﬁcant 1142.5 basis points.

Regression Analysis

We begin with a simple test of the collateral channel hypothesis by estimating diﬀerent variants of
the following baseline speciﬁcation:

Spreadi,a,t = β1 × log(1 + Bankrupt Buyers)i,a,t + β2 × Bankruptcyi,a,t
+ β3 × log(1 + Redeployability)i,a,t + Xi,a,tγ + bi δ + ca η + dy θ
+ (Bankruptcyi,a,t × bi )κ + (Bankruptcyi,a,t × ca )ψ + i,a,t ,

(1)

where Spread is the tranche credit spread, subscripts indicate tranche (i ), airline (a), and trans13

action date (t); Bankrupt Buyers is the weighted average of the number of bankrupt operators
currently using the collateral pool; Bankruptcy is a dummy variable that equals one if the issuer of
the tranche is bankrupt on the date of the transaction; Redeployability is one of our two measures of
the redeployability of the collateral pool; Xi,a,t is a vector of tranche characteristics that includes an
amortization dummy, a dummy for tranches with liquidity facility, ranking of the tranche seniority,
tranche issue size, a dummy for tranches with a call provision, and the tranche term-to-maturity;
bi is a vector of tranche ﬁxed-eﬀects; ca is a vector of airline ﬁxed-eﬀects; dy is a vector of year
ﬁxed-eﬀects; Bankruptcyi,a,t × bi is a vector of interaction terms between tranche ﬁxed-eﬀects and
the Bankruptcy dummy; Bankruptcyi,a,t × ca is a vector of interaction terms between airline ﬁxedeﬀects and the Bankruptcy dummy; and i,a,t is the regression residual. We report the results from
estimating diﬀerent variants of regression 1 in Panel A of Table 5.12 Tables throughout the paper
report standard errors that are clustered at the tranche level (in parentheses).
The ﬁrst column in Panel A Table 5 reports the coeﬃcients from estimating a simple version
of regression 1, without any of the ﬁxed-eﬀects or the interaction terms. As would be expected,
tranche spreads of airlines in bankruptcy are higher than those out of bankruptcy – the coeﬃcient
on the Bankruptcy dummy, β2 , equals 126.6 and is statistically signiﬁcant. Further, consistent
with Benmelech and Bergman (2009), we ﬁnd that more redeployable collateral, proxied by the
number of world-wide operators using the collateral pool, is associated with lower spreads. Finally,
after controlling for bankruptcy and redeployability, and consistent with a collateral channel, β1
is positive and signiﬁcant at the one percent level. Increases in the number of bankrupt potential
buyers for a given collateral pool – and hence commensurate reductions in demand for the assets in
that pool – are associated with larger tranche credit spreads. The economic eﬀect of the collateral
channel is sizeable – as Panel C shows moving from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile of
the number of bankrupt buyers results in a credit spread that is higher by 387.2 basis points.
In the rest of the speciﬁcations reported in Panel A we add year and either tranche or airline
ﬁxed-eﬀects, and in some speciﬁcations include interactions between tranche or airline ﬁxed-eﬀects
and the bankruptcy dummy to soak up any direct eﬀect of bankruptcy on tranche spreads. As can be
seen, the coeﬃcient on the number of bankrupt buyers, β1 , is consistently positive and statistically
signiﬁcant at the one percent level. While the estimate of β1 is lower in these speciﬁcations, it
12
For brevity, we do not report the coeﬃcients of the tranche characteristics in this table. We investigate their
eﬀects in the next tables.

14

is still economically signiﬁcant: as Panel C shows, moving from the 25th percentile to the 75th
percentile of the number of bankrupt buyers in these speciﬁcations results in a credit spread that
is higher by between 147.1 and 238.2 basis points.
Panel B of Table 5 repeats the analysis in Panel A using our second measure of shocks to
collateral values, Bankrupt Aircraft, that is based on the number of aircraft operated by bankrupt
airlines that overlap with the collateral channel. As can be seen, an increase in the number of
aircraft operated by bankrupt airlines is associated with higher credit spreads of tranches employing
similar aircraft model types as collateral. Although the magnitudes of the coeﬃcients are smaller
than those using the Bankrupt Buyers measure (see Panel C), the results are still statistically and
economically signiﬁcant.

4.3.

The Collateral Channel: Evidence from Prices of Non-Bankrupt Airlines
Tranches

The analysis presented in Table 5 shows that bankrupt potential buyers of collateral lead to
higher credit spreads, controlling for bankruptcy status and for interaction terms between being in bankruptcy, and airline, and tranche ﬁxed-eﬀects. While these speciﬁcations are likely to
soak up non time-varying eﬀects related to the bankruptcy status of a tranche, we now move to
focusing only on non-bankrupt airlines. Thus, we reﬁne our analysis by focusing on tranches of nonbankrupt airlines and examine how, while solvent, their credit spreads respond to the bankruptcy
of airlines operating ﬂeets comprised of model types that overlap with the tranche collateral pool.
We estimate diﬀerent variants of the following speciﬁcation:
Spreadi,a,t

=

β1 × log(1 + Bankrupt Buyers)i,a,t + β2 × log(1 + Redeployability)i,a,t

+

Itτ + Xi,a,tγ + Za,y−1 ξ + Rt π + bi δ + ca η + dy θ + i,a,t

f or all Bankruptcyi,a,t = 0,

(2)

where Spread is the tranche credit spread; subscripts indicate tranche (i ), airline (a), and transaction date (t); Bankrupt Buyers is a weighted average of the number of bankrupt operators currently
using the collateral pool; Bankruptcy is a dummy variable that equals to one if the issuer of the
tranche is bankrupt on the date of the transaction; and Redeployability is one of our two measures of the redeployability of the collateral pool. It is a vector which includes two time-varying
variables that capture the health of the airline industry – the price of jet fuel and the number of
15

U.S. bankrupt airlines; Xi,a,t is a vector of tranche characteristics that includes an amortization
dummy, a dummy for tranches with a liquidity facility, the ranking of tranche seniority, tranche
issue size, a dummy for tranches with a call provision, and the tranche term-to-maturity; Za,y−1
is a vector of beginning-of-year airline characteristics that includes the airline size, market-to-book
ratio, proﬁtability, and leverage; Rt is a vector of interest rate controls that includes the 1-year
yield on U.S. Treasury, the term spread between the 7-year and 1-year Treasury, and the default
spread between Baa and Aaa rated bonds.13 bi is a vector of tranche ﬁxed-eﬀects, ca is a vector
of airline ﬁxed-eﬀects, dy is a vector of year ﬁxed-eﬀects, and i,a,t is the regression residual. We
report the results from estimating diﬀerent variants of regression 2 in Table 6. As before, we cluster
standard errors (reported in parentheses) at the tranche level.
Column 1 of Table 6 presents the results of regression 2 using only year ﬁxed eﬀects. As can be
seen, the positive relation between the number of bankrupt operators and credit spreads continues
to be statistically signiﬁcant even after controlling for a host of tranche and ﬁrm level control
variables. Thus, consistent with the collateral channel, increases in the number of potential buyers
of collateral who are in bankruptcy are associated with increases in the spread of tranches backed
by this collateral.
Turning to the control variables, we ﬁnd that as in Benmelech and Bergman (2009), the negative
eﬀect of redeployability is still signiﬁcant once tranche and airline level controls are added to the
regressions. While the coeﬃcient on fuel price is positive, it is not statistically signiﬁcant. However,
we ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant evidence that when more airlines are in bankruptcy, tranche spreads
tend to be higher.
Examining the tranche level control variables, we ﬁnd that amortized tranches have lower
spreads, which is to be expected as their repayment schedule is more front loaded and hence their
credit risk is lower. Likewise, tranches that are enhanced by a liquidity facility have lower spreads,
and more senior tranches command lower spreads as well.14 We also ﬁnd that larger tranches are
associated with lower spreads, consistent with larger tranches being more liquid (see e.g. Bao, Pan,
and Wang (2008)). We do not ﬁnd a statistically signiﬁcant relation between spreads and having
a call provision. Finally, tranches with longer term-to-maturity have higher credit spreads.
13

All yield data is taken from the Economic Research Federal Reserve Bank of St.
Louis website at
http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/. For brevity, we do not report the coeﬃcients of the interest rates variables.
14
Recall that seniority variable is coded as a discrete variable between 1 and 4 with 1 being the most senior tranche,
explaining the negative coeﬃcient on the variable in the table.

16

The airline level control variables in Column 1 show that, as would be expected, airlines that are
more proﬁtable or less leveraged have lower credit spreads. This eﬀect is economically signiﬁcant,
with a one standard deviation increase in proﬁtability reducing the tranche credit spread by 67.74
basis points, and a one standard deviation increase in leverage increasing the spread by 68.13 basis
points.15 Finally, we ﬁnd that airlines with high market to book ratios have lower higher credit
spreads.
Column 2 of Table 6 repeats the analysis in Column 1 while adding airline ﬁxed eﬀects to
the speciﬁcation. As can be seen, the results remain qualitatively and quantitatively unchanged:
increases in the number of potential buyers that are in bankruptcy leads to an increase in the
tranche credit spread. Column 3 repeats the analysis but adds tranche level ﬁxed eﬀects to the
speciﬁcation and hence control for unobserved heterogeneity amongst tranches. Naturally, in the
tranche ﬁxed eﬀects speciﬁcation the tranche level controls are dropped as they do not vary over
time and hence are fully absorbed by the ﬁxed eﬀects. As can be seen in the table, we continue to
ﬁnd a positive relation between the number of buyers in bankruptcy and credit spreads.
We also note that the coeﬃcients on the redeployability measures are still negative as in Benmelech and Bergman (2009), but no longer statistically signiﬁcant once we include tranche ﬁxed
eﬀects – a result recurrent throughout the analysis. To understand this note that, in the time series,
variation in redeployability and the bankruptcy measures is driven by airlines entering or exiting
bankruptcy; when a potential buyer airline enters bankruptcy, the number of bankrupt buyers increases by one, while the redeployability measure decreases by one. However, the redeployability
measure also varies in the time series due to new airlines starting up and increasing the number of
potential buyers. The fact that with tranche ﬁxed eﬀects the number of bankrupt buyers variable
is signiﬁcant while the redeployability measure is not, suggests that in the time series, the important variation that drives changes in spreads is not the addition of new airlines but rather airlines
entering or exiting bankruptcy.
In columns 4 through 6 we repeat our analysis using our second measure of shocks to collateral
values, Bankrupt Aircraft, that is based on the number of aircraft that overlap with the tranche
collateral pool that are operated by bankrupt airlines. While our results are statistically weaker
15

Also, to the extent that there is some slack in the pricing of the debt – i.e. that the market for airline tranches
is not perfecetly competitive, but rather results in part from a negotiation between the airline and buyers of it debt
capital – this results is also consistent with lower bargaining power of the ‘weak’ issuing airlines who are willing to
place the debt at lower prices.

17

using this measure, they are consistent with the previous estimates when we control for airline or
tranche (in addition to year) ﬁxed eﬀects – the Bankrupt Aircraft measure is signiﬁcantly related
to higher tranche credit spreads. Consistent with the collateral channel, increases in the number
of aircraft operated by bankrupt airlines are associated with higher credit spreads of tranches
employing similar aircraft model types as collateral.

4.4.

Robustness: Controlling for Industry Conditions

One concern with our analysis is that we are capturing an adverse industry shock aﬀecting all
airlines in the industry. First, it should be noted that our identiﬁcation strategy relies on the
diﬀerential impact of an airline’s bankruptcy on the credit spreads of tranches which are secured
by diﬀerent aircraft model types, and as such an industry shock is unlikely to drive our ﬁndings.
Second, our results in Table 6 are robust to the inclusion of industry control variables such as fuel
price and the number of bankrupt airlines. Nevertheless, in order to further alleviate this concern
we use a battery of industry controls that include, in addition to jet fuel price and number of
bankrupt airlines, also the asset share of bankrupt airlines (deﬁned as the book value of the assets
of bankrupt airlines divided by the total book value of airlines in the U.S), and the relative number
of bankrupt airlines (number of bankrupt airlines divided by the total number of airlines). Likewise,
in diﬀerent speciﬁcations we also control for the complements of these variables: the number of
healthy airlines, as well as the asset share and the relative number of healthy airlines.
Table 7 reports the results from estimating regression 2 with tranche ﬁxed-eﬀects and an augmented vector of time-varying industry controls. For brevity, we report results with the bankruptbased industry variables using the number of bankrupt buyers, and the healthy-based industry
variables using the number of bankrupt aircraft.16 As can be seen, the number of bankrupt airlines
as well as the relative number of bankrupt airlines have the predicted positive sign and are statistically signiﬁcant, while the asset share of bankrupt airlines is not signiﬁcant.17 Importantly, as
Table 7 demonstrates, our results are robust to the inclusion of all of the industry controls. In fact
the coeﬃcient β1 becomes even stronger when we add additional industry controls that potentially
soak up more of the time-series variation in tranche credit spreads.
16

Clearly, controlling for the asset share and relative number of healthy airlines is equivalent to using the complement
variables of the asset share and relative number of bankrupt airlines.
17
We add these controls one at a time as they are all highly collinear. In unreported results we include all industry
controls together and our results hold for both measures of the collateral channel. Since the industry controls are
highly collinear, their signiﬁcance disappears when they are added together due to multicollinearity.

18

Another concern is that while we control for a battery of industry controls, it is still possible
that the negative information provided by the bankruptcy of an airline with a given ﬂeet is of
greater relevance for particular airlines. According to this view, the information channel may still
be operative since some airlines may have diﬀerent sensitivities to industry conditions than others.
We address this concern in Table 8. We add to the analysis in Table 6 a dummy variable for the
post 9/11/2001 period, in which average American airline proﬁtability fell drastically.18 We use the
post-9/11 dummy as an additional industry control and indeed ﬁnd that credit spreads are much
higher in the period following the 9/11 attacks.
Moreover, we interact airline ﬁxed-eﬀects with the 9/11 dummy to control for airline heterogeneity in their response to this severe industry shock. As Table 8 shows, the coeﬃcient of β1 is
still statistically signiﬁcant and is again stronger than in our baseline regressions in Table 6.19 To
summarize, our analysis is robust to various industry controls even when we allow airlines to have
heterogenous response to industry conditions.

4.5.

Robustness: Reverse Causality

A more subtle concern is about the direction of causality. We argue that bankruptcies of potential
buyers lead to declines in asset values, increasing the cost of debt ﬁnancing of non-bankrupt airlines.
However, an alternative explanation is that an adverse shock to the productivity of some aircraft
results in the bankruptcy of airlines using them, as well as a decline in value and increased cost of
capital for other users of these aircraft.
The reverse causality explanation is best exempliﬁed with the case of the Arospatiale-BAC
Concorde – the famous supersonic passenger airliner. While the Concorde was designed for supersonic long-haul trips, such as between London and New York, it was used in the late 1970s
by Braniﬀ International Airways on shorter range subsonic ﬂights within the United States. The
ﬂights were usually less than 50% booked, leading Braniﬀ to terminate Concorde operations in May
1980. Braniﬀ ﬁled for bankruptcy in May 1982. To the extent that Braniﬀ’s bankruptcy reﬂected
a failed strategy associated with operating the Concorde, the reverse causality argument would
suggest that market priors about the viability of the Concorde aircraft would be updated, resulting
ultimately in higher costs of capital for other users of this aircraft.
18

Benmelech and Bergman (2008) report that the average proﬁtability of airlines in their sample was 13.31% in
the period 1994-2000, and only 4.77% in the period 2001-2005.
19
We obtain similar results using all other industry controls which we do not report for brevity.

19

We deal with the reverse causality argument suggested by the Braniﬀ case empirically in Table
9. It is important to note, however, that while the Concorde is a specialized aircraft with limited
eﬃcient uses outside supersonic long-haul travel, all the aircraft used as collateral in our sample
are commonly used general-purpose aircraft. Our sample includes the most popular models of
Airbus (A300, A310, A319, A320, A321, A330), Boeing (B737, B747, B757, B767, and B777) and
MacDonald Douglas (MD11, MD80), as well as regional aircraft made by BAE and Embraer. None
of these models is specialized or esoteric, and none of the models experienced an idiosyncratic shock
during this time-period making it less desirable. Nevertheless, we address the reverse causality
concern empirically.
We construct dummy variables for each of the diﬀerent aircraft models that take the value of
one if there is at least one aircraft of that model in the tranche collateral pool. We then rerun our
regressions with tranche ﬁxed-eﬀects as well as year×model ﬁxed-eﬀects, allowing diﬀerent aircraft
models to have a time-varying eﬀect on credit spreads. As the ﬁrst two columns of Table 9 show, our
results are even stronger using both the bankrupt buyers and bankrupt aircraft measures. We also
run the regression for tranches that employ only Airbus and Boeing aircraft as collateral (column 3)
or even only Boeing aircraft (column 4) – Airbus and Boeing are the leading aircraft manufacturers
in the world and their aircraft are both general-purpose and highly reliable. In our sample, there
are 105 tranches that use only Airbus and Boeing, and 69 tranches using only Boeing. In focusing
on these subsamples, we are identifying oﬀ of variation in the number of potential buyers of Airbus
and Boeing aircraft that are in bankruptcy. As Table 9 demonstrates, our results hold both for
Airbus and Boeing, as well as only for Boeing. Our results therefore hold also for general purpose,
popular aircraft for which it is unlikely that new information about productivity is being revealed.
For additional robustness, we further control for the aircrafts’ main usage in our analysis.
The main diﬀerence between aircraft in our collateral pool is whether they are short-haul narrowbodied (e.g. A319, A320, A321, B737, B757, etc.) or long-haul wide-bodied (A300, A310, A330,
B747. B767, B777).20 We construct a dummy variable that equals one for wide-bodied aircraft and
interact it with month-year ﬁxed-eﬀects (i.e. every month-year combination in our data corresponds
to a particular dummy variable). As the last two columns of Table 9 show, our results still hold.
Again, it is therefore unlikely that our results are driven by new information about the productivity
associated with the main usage of the aircraft models used as collateral.
20

A narrow-body aircraft is one with a single passenger aisle, while a wide-body aircraft has two such aisles.

20

4.6.

Robustness: Liquidity Facility and Credit Enhancement

As described in Section 2, 75% of the tranches in our sample are Enhanced Equipment Trust
Certiﬁcates (EETCs) which include a liquidity facility that enhances their credit worthiness. The
credit enhancer, which is typically a ﬁnancial institution, commits to pay interest payments in case
of default for a prespeciﬁed amount of time, usually 18 months. The standard reason given for such
an enhancement is to enable a more orderly sale of aircraft, providing ‘breathing room’ to prevent
ﬁre sales. For example, in an EETC issued by Continental Airlines in 2002 (2002-1) the primary
liquidity facility is provided by Landesbank Hessen-Thüringen Girozentrale, supplemented by a
liquidity facility from Merrill Lynch Capital Services Inc. Likewise, in EETC Series 2000-3 issued
by U.S Airways in 2000, the liquidity facility was provided by Morgan Stanley Capital Services,
while the 1998-1 Series EETC issued by U.S. Airways had its liquidity facility provided by the
Chicago Branch of ABN ARMO Bank N.V.
Since the liquidity facility credit enhancements are provided by third parties and not the airline
itself, they do not expose the tranche to further airline liquidity risk. Still, our results could be
explained by a contagion eﬀect through the quality of credit enhancers if, for some reason, tranches
backed by aircraft of similar type were enhanced by the same institutions or by institutions with
stronger links.21 We control for the provision of a liquidity facility in our analysis above and our
results are always robust. Nevertheless, to deal with the concern of contagion through liquidity
enhancers, we rerun our regressions separately for tranches without a liquidity facility.
As Table 10 demonstrates, our results continue to hold for both measures of redeployability,
even amongst those tranches with no liquidity enhancement, and hence without the possibility of
contagion through credit enhancers. The results hold when we include airline or tranche ﬁxedeﬀects, in addition to year ﬁxed-eﬀects. Indeed, we ﬁnd that β1 , the coeﬃcient on our Bankrupt
Buyers and Bankrupt Aircraft measures, is larger for tranches without liquidity enhancements. Put
diﬀerently, spreads of tranches without a liquidity enhancement are more sensitive to bankruptcy
shocks. This is to be expected: since in default there is no liquidity enhancement, ﬁre sales are
more likely, and hence having more potential buyers in ﬁnancial distress (i.e. Bankrupt Buyers is
high) is more costly. Similarly, attempting to sell collateral when similar assets are already ﬂooding
the market (i.e. Bankrupt Aircraft is high) is costly as well.
21

As a related example, during the peak of the ﬁnancial crisis in 2008, concerns about Ambac and MBIA led to
downgrades of CDO tranches insured by these companies.

21

Additionally, we ﬁnd that credit spreads of tranches without a liquidity facility are more sensitive
to airline proﬁtability and leverage as compared to tranches with such a liquidity facility. Again,
this is to be expected, since the higher probability of ﬁre sales in default associated with the lack of
a liquidity facility implies that airline ﬁnancial condition becomes more important in determining
spreads.

4.7.

Robustness: Accounting for Contagion through Security Holders

Another potential contagion eﬀect arises through holders of ETC and EETC securities. Since the
Mergent Fixed-Income Securities Database (FISD) used in our analysis contains transactions undertaken by insurance companies, it is possible that when airlines enter ﬁnancial distress, insurance
companies operating subject to prudent investment regulations or guidelines sell their holdings of
tranches issued by the distressed airlines. In this case, the contagion operates through ﬁre-sales of
risky-airline securities and not necessarily though an underlying collateral channel.
We address the concern of contagion through holders of securities in a number of ways. First,
for each observation in our dataset we have information on whether the reported transaction was
a purchase or a sale by the reporting insurance company. We conjecture that contagion through
holders of securities should be reﬂected mainly in sell-side transactions in which a binding balance
sheet or investment policy constraint triggered by equity losses forces an insurance company to
rebalance its portfolio by selling part of its holdings of corporate debt. We therefore subdivide our
sample based on whether a transaction represents a sale or a purchase of a tranche by an insurance
company and rerun our regressions in each subsample separately. As Table 11 shows, we ﬁnd that
both of our measures, Bankrupt Buyer (columns 1-4) and Bankrupt Aircraft (columns 5-8), are
statistically signiﬁcant and positively related to credit spreads in both subsamples. Indeed, we ﬁnd
that the coeﬃcient on the bankruptcy measures are twice as large in the ‘buy’ sample as compared
to the ‘sell’ sample, in contrast to the contagion by holders of securities hypothesis.
As an additional method of dealing with the alternative hypothesis of contagion through security
holders, we employ data on tranche credit rating at the time of the transaction. We conjecture that
contagion due to regulation or investment policy constraints should be concentrated in downgrades
of corporate bonds from investment to non-investment grade. We therefore match each tranche
transaction to its Moody’s credit rating at the time of transaction using Moody’s Default Risk Service (DRS) Database. We then subdivide our sample based on the rating of the tranche at the time

22

of the transaction, running our regressions on the subsample of transactions of investment grade
tranches (i.e. the top 10 credit rating notches: Aaa through Baa3), the subsample of transactions
of tranches rated Aaa-Aa3 (the top 4 notches), and the subsample of transactions of tranches rated
Aaa (the top notch). Although examining subsamples separately naturally reduces the sample size
in each individual regression, and considerably so for the third subsample in which we only examine
Aaa tranches, as Table 12 shows, we ﬁnd that our results continue to hold for both Buy and Sell
transactions in all three subsamples: investment grade (columns 1-2); Aaa-Aa3 (columns 3-4), and
Aaa (columns 5-6). Thus, our results hold for both purchases and sales of tranches that are very
highly rated, alleviating concerns about contagion through rating-based regulation ﬁre-sales.22
As an additional robustness check, we have also excluded the last two years of our sample from
our regressions to ensure that any unusual circumstances related to forced sales during the current
ﬁnancial crisis are not driving our results. Our results (columns 7-8 of Table 12) continue to hold
using this slice as well.23 Hence, our results are not driven by the sell-oﬀ of asset-backed securities
of 2007-2008.
Moreover, in an attempt to control for the identities of the insurance companies transacting in
tranches, we split the sample into transactions made by Life Insurance ﬁrms and those made by
Property & Casualty ﬁrms.24 There are 4,780 transactions made by Property & Casualty ﬁrms and
11,297 transactions by Life Insurance ﬁrms. As Table C1 in Appendix C demonstrates, our results
are almost identical across insurance companies types. Using both measures of redeployability, we
obtain very similar statistically signiﬁcant relations between either the number of bankrupt buyers
or the number of bankrupt aircraft and tranche credit spreads. Our results, therefore, do not appear
to be driven by institutional details speciﬁc to a particular type of insurance company.
Finally, in 3,205 transactions in our data we were able to identify the vendor (broker or dealer)
selling or buying the security from the insurance company. There are 45 individual vendors (typically, investment banks, commercial banks, or brokers) in this subsample. Using this subsample, the
last four columns of Table 6 report regression results from estimating the eﬀect of both Bankrupt
Buyers (columns 5-6) and Bankrupt Aircraft (columns 7-8) on credit spreads, controlling for either airline+year or tranche+year ﬁxed eﬀects as well as vendor ﬁxed eﬀects. As Table C1 shows,
22

While our results hold using both measures of redeployability, for brevity we only report results using the Bankrupt
Buyers measure.
23
Our results hold whether we use the 1994-2005 or the 1994-2006 periods. While the year 2007 arguably marks
the beginning of the crisis, we exclude trades during the year 2006 as well out of an abundance of caution.
24
The FISD data does not provide us the identity of the insurance companies – only their type.

23

our results hold in this cut of the data as well. Consistent with the collateral channel, both the
Bankrupt Buyers and Bankrupt Aircraft are both positively related to tranche credit spreads, even
when controlling for vendor ﬁxed eﬀects.
In summary, our results are not likely to be driven by ﬁre-sales, rating-based investment rules
and regulations, insurance company type or the identity of the vendor. We conclude that contagion
through investors does not seem to explain the strong relation between bankruptcy shocks and credit
spreads.

4.8.

The Collateral Channel, Tranche Seniority and LTV

We continue our analysis in Table 13 by examining the eﬀects of tranche seniority and Loan-toValue (LTV) ratios in the collateral channel. We hypothesize that the negative relation between the
measure of the number of bankrupt buyers or number of bankrupt aircraft and credit spreads should
be concentrated in more junior tranches, or equivalently in tranches with high LTV, since these
are the ones which, upon default, would be more exposed to drops in the value of the underlying
collateralized assets. As a ﬁrst test of this hypothesis, Column 1 of Table 13 presents the results of
regression 2 while adding an interaction variable between the measure of the number of bankrupt
buyers, Bankrupt Buyers, and the seniority of each tranche.25 The regression includes either airlineor tranche- (as well as year-) ﬁxed-eﬀects and standard errors are clustered at the tranche level.
As can be seen in column 1 of Table 13, we ﬁnd that the coeﬃcient on the interaction term
between Bankrupt Buyers and tranche seniority is positive and statistically signiﬁcant. As hypothesized, we thus ﬁnd that increases in the number of bankrupt potential buyers increases the
spread of junior tranches more than that of senior tranches. The diﬀerential eﬀect of moving from
zero to one bankrupt buyer in most senior as compared to most junior tranches is 106.01 basis
points.26 We repeat the analysis in column 2 controlling for tranche ﬁxed eﬀects and obtain similar
results.27 Furthermore, we stratify the data between senior tranches (seniority levels 1 and 2) and
junior tranches (seniority levels 3 and 4) and estimate regression 2 separately for senior and junior
tranches. As the coeﬃcients on the Bankrupt Buyers measure in columns 3 and 4 indicate, junior
tranches are much more sensitive to the number of bankrupt buyers, consistent with the interaction
25

We obtain similar results using Bankrupt Aircraft which we do not report fro brevity.
To see this, we calculate the joint eﬀect of seniority and number of bankrupt buyers on credit spreads using the
total diﬀerential of both the level of Bankrupt Buyers as well as the interaction with seniority. Thus, this diﬀerential
is −163.798 × 0.301 + (171.992 × 0.301 × 4) − (171.992 × 0.301 × 1) = 106.01
27
Clearly, the variable seniority is being absorbed by the tranche ﬁxed-eﬀects in this speciﬁcation.

results.
In the last four columns of Table 13 we repeat the analysis but categorize tranches based on loanto-value ratios (LTVs) rather than seniority. LTVs are obtained from the tranche ﬁling prospectus,
and reﬂect cumulative loan-to-value ratios as of the time of issue.28 Speciﬁcally, these are deﬁned
as the ratio between the sum of the principal amount of that tranche and all tranches senior to it,
divided by an appraisal of the value of the assets serving as collateral.
We begin with speciﬁcations in which LTV is interacted with Bankrupt Buyers (columns 5
and 6) and ﬁnd results that are consistent with the seniority interactions – credit spreads are
more sensitive to the Bankrupt Buyer measure amongst tranches with high LTVs. Increasing the
Bankrupt Buyer measure from zero to one for tranches at the 25th percentile of LTV (0.41) reduces
tranche credit spreads by 10.7 basis points. In contrast, the same increase for tranches at the 75th
percentile of LTV (0.66) causes tranche spreads to decrease by 44.15 basis points. In the last two
columns of Table 13 we stratify the sample into tranches with LTVs below 0.5 (column 7) and
those with LTVs at or above 0.5 (column 8).29 As columns 7 and 8 demonstrate, credit spreads
of tranches with LTVs higher than 0.5 are more sensitive to the number of bankrupt buyers than
those with LTV lower than 0.5. Indeed, the coeﬃcient on Bankrupt Buyers more than doubles in
high as compared to low LTV subsamples.
We investigate the transmission of the collateral channel further in Table 14 by studying the
joint impact of airline ﬁnancial health and the number of bankrupt buyers on tranche spreads. We
hypothesize that the positive relation between the number of potential buyers in bankruptcy and
tranche credit spreads should be larger for airlines with low proﬁtability. Less proﬁtable airlines
are more likely to be in ﬁnancial distress, making the value of their tranches more sensitive to the
liquidation value of their collateral. Further, as in the previous section, we expect that the eﬀect
should be more pronounced amongst more junior, high LTV tranches. We therefore introduce an
interaction variable between proﬁtability and Bankrupt Buyers into the speciﬁcation of regression
2. Similar to the analysis in Table 13, we run the analysis separately for senior and junior tranches
(columns 1 and 2) as well as for tranches with LTVs below and above 0.5 (columns 3 and 4).30 Each
28

We are unable to obtain dynamic LTVs along the economic life of the tranche as we do not have a time series of
aircraft value estimates.
29
We choose 0.5 as the breakpoint to ease interpretation - as Table 2 shows, 0.5 is only slightly higher than the
median LTV (0.49).
30
In essence, these regressions thus test the triple interaction between our measure of the number of bankrupt
buyers, airline proﬁtability and either tranche seniority or LTV.

25

regression includes tranche and airline ﬁxed eﬀects with standard errors clustered at the tranche
level.
As can be seen in Table 14, the coeﬃcient on the interaction term between Bankrupt Buyers
and proﬁtability is more negative for junior tranches and for tranches with high LTV ratios. In
particular, for junior tranches, the impact of proﬁtability on the importance of Bankrupt Buyers
in determining tranche spreads is approximately ten times larger than the same eﬀect for senior
tranches. Having one potential bankrupt buyer and moving from the 25 to the 75 percentiles of
airline proﬁtability is associated with a decrease of 89.45 basis points in credit spreads of senior
tranches, compared to 265.64 basis points for junior tranches.31 Likewise, while the interaction term
between Bankrupt Buyers and proﬁtability is small and not statistically signiﬁcant for tranches
with low LTVs, the eﬀect is much higher and statistically signiﬁcant for tranches with high LTV.
As a ﬁnal robustness check, we investigate further the role of the probability of airline bankruptcy.
While we ﬁnd support for the conjecture that the collateral channel is stronger when proﬁtability is
lower, our analysis thus far does not account for situations in which an airline’s current proﬁtability
is low, but its balance sheet is still strong making the airline’s default unlikely. To allow for this, we
construct a more complete measure of airline health by estimating the probability that an airline
will ﬁle for Chapter-11 in a given year. We then use airlines’ predicted probability of bankruptcy
as a more comprehensive measure of the airline’s ﬁnancial health.
Similar to Shumway (2001), we regress the probability of a bankruptcy on lagged values of
size, leverage, market-to-book, proﬁtability, the short-term debt to assets ratio, and both year and
airline ﬁxed-eﬀects. Our estimated linear probability model (standard errors clustered by airline
are reported in parentheses) is:
P r(Bankruptcy = 1)a,t = 0.037 ∗ Sizea,t−1 + 0.009 ∗ Leveragea,t−1 + 0.124 ∗ M toBa,t−1

To see the former, note that (−754.646 × (0.131 − 0.036) − 620.859 × 0.301 × (0.131 − 0.036)) = −89.45. The
latter eﬀect is calculated in an analogous manner.

26

a vector of year ﬁxed-eﬀects, and a,t is the regression residual.
As can be seen, the two signiﬁcant determinants of bankruptcy are proﬁtability and the ratio of
short-term debt to assets. We next calculate imputed bankruptcy probabilities, P r(Bankruptcy),
for each airline-year based on airline characteristics. The last four columns of Table 14 report
the coeﬃcients from estimating regressions with interactions between Bankrupt Buyers and this
P r(Bankruptcy) measure. As before, we split the sample between junior and senior tranches,
and high versus low LTV tranches. Given that P r(Bankruptcy) is a linear combination of airline
characteristics, we do not include airline-level variables in these regressions.
While the estimates based on seniority level are not statistically signiﬁcant, we ﬁnd that using
LTV to stratify our sample (Columns 7 and 8) yields results consistent with the proﬁtability
interaction regressions. We ﬁnd that for tranches with high loan to value ratios, i.e. those more
exposed to default, the eﬀect of Bankrupt Buyers on credit spreads increases when the probability
of airline bankruptcy is higher. For example, for tranches with LTV>0.5 the incremental eﬀect of
one additional bankrupt buyer, evaluated at the 75th percentile of bankruptcy probability (0.22)
is 44.9 basis points. In contrast, for tranches with low loan to value (LTV<0.5), the eﬀect of
Bankrupt Buyers on credit spreads is low even when the probability of default is high, consistent
with the protection that the underlying collateral provides for these relatively senior tranches. For
example, evaluated at the 75th percentile of bankruptcy probability, the incremental eﬀect of an
additional bankrupt buyer is only 18.3 basis points.32
To summarize, our results are consistent with the notion that the eﬀect of the collateral channel
is larger for more junior and more highly leveraged securities of weaker ﬁrms. Even if the airline
defaults on its tranche obligations, the most senior claimants will be least exposed to ﬂuctuations
in the value of the underlying collateral and hence do not require particularly strong demand for
the assets serving as collateral. In contrast, for tranches of lower seniority, proﬁtability plays a
much larger role in determining the relation between potential demand for collateral, as proxied
by Bankrupt Buyers, and tranche spread. For these more junior tranches, when the ﬁnancial
health of the ﬁrm deteriorates and hence default probabilities go up, being able to ﬁnd a buyer for
the underlying collateral is of crucial importance. Put diﬀerently, when proﬁtability is low, junior
secured creditors are very much harmed when a large number of potential buyers are experiencing
32
In calculating these ﬁgures we use the total diﬀerential taking into account both the level and the interaction
term.

27

ﬁnancial diﬃculty and are in bankruptcy.
Finally, we analyze the interaction between the Bankrupt Buyers measure and tranche redeployability. Following Shleifer and Vishny (1992), we hypothesize that if assets are more redeployable, potential buyers entering ﬁnancial distress should have a smaller impact on collateral values
and credit spreads. Therefore, the positive relation between Bankrupt Buyers and tranche credit
spreads should be lower for tranches with more redeployable collateral.
We regress tranche credit spreads on the Bankrupt Buyers measure, our measure of tranche redeployability that is based on the number of aircraft, and an interaction between Bankrupt Buyers
and tranche redeployability. As independent variables we also include our regular set of tranche
and airline controls, employing both year and either airline and tranche ﬁxed eﬀects. As can
be seen in Table 15, we ﬁnd that consistent with our hypothesis, the interaction term between
Bankrupt Buyers and the tranche aircraft redeployability measure is negative and signiﬁcant.
While increases in Bankrupt Buyers lead to increased spreads, this eﬀect is weaker in more redeployable tranches. For example, for tranches in the 25th percentile of redeployability, increasing
having one bankrupt buyer increases spreads by 76.6 basis points, while in contrast the same eﬀect
in tranches at the 75th percentile of redeployability is only 20.3 basis points.

Conclusion

Our analysis shows that bankrupt ﬁrms impose negative externalities on their non-bankrupt competitors through a collateral channel mechanism in which industry bankruptcies lead to reductions
in collateral values of other industry participants. This, in turn, increases the cost of external debt
ﬁnance across the industry. While our analysis focuses on one particular industry, the collateral
channel has broader, economy-wide implications. Indeed, the collateral channel should be viewed
as a particular form of ﬁnancial accelerator in which frictions in raising external ﬁnance amplify and
propagate industry downturns. Following a negative shock, a fraction of ﬁrms enter bankruptcy
and sell part of their assets. As a result, collateral values drop industry wide, increasing the cost
of external ﬁnance, magnifying the shock further. Recent events in the ongoing ﬁnancial crisis
of 2007-2009 suggest that bankruptcy induced contagion through collateral shocks are of crucial
importance in magnifying shocks to the economy at large. If such bankruptcy-induced externalities
are suﬃciently large, the collateral channel may ultimately result in downward spirals – bankrupt-

28

cies lead to declines in collateral values and capital availability industry-wide, thereby inducing
even more bankruptcies.

Appendix A. Constructing Redeployability and Bankruptcy Measures
In this appendix we provide more detail regarding the construction of the redeployability variables
and the bankruptcy variables used in the analysis.
As in Benmelech and Bergman (2008 and 2009) and Gavazza (2008), we measure the redeployability of aircrafts by exploiting aircraft model heterogeneity. In order to reduce costs associated
with operating diﬀerent aircraft types, airlines tend to operate a limited number of aircraft models.
Potential secondary market buyers of any given type of aircraft, therefore, are likely to be airlines
already operating the same type of aircraft. Thus, redeployability is proxied by the number of
potential buyers and the ‘popularity’ of an aircraft model type.
Using the Ascend CASE database, we construct two redeployability measures in the following
manner. We ﬁrst construct annual redeployability measures for each aircraft type. For every
aircraft type and sample-year we compute 1) the number of non-bankrupt operators ﬂying that
aircraft model type; and 2) the number of aircraft of that type used by non-bankrupt operators.
This process yields two redeployability measures for each aircraft-type and each sample-year. To
construct the redeployability measures for a portfolio of aircraft serving as collateral for a particular
tranche, we aggregate the aircraft-type redeployability measures across all aircraft in the portfolio.
Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne the redeployability of the collateral-portfolio to be the weighted average of
the redeployability index corresponding to each of the aircraft in the portfolio. The two measures
are given by:
aircraf t

ωi,t,s = numberi,t,s × seatss

 S


numberi,t,s × seatss

s

We use the number of seats in an aircraft model as a proxy for its size (and value) in our weighted
average calculations.
We construct two measures of shocks to collateral driven by airlines entering bankruptcy. For each
aircraft type and calendar day in our sample we calculate (1) the number of airlines operating that
particular model type which are in bankruptcy; and (2) the number of aircraft of that particular type
which are operated by airlines in bankruptcy.33 Since changes in aircraft ownership are relatively
infrequent, ownership information of aircraft is updated at a yearly rather than daily frequency.
However, the two measures may change at a daily frequency due to airlines entering or exiting
bankruptcy.
33

We calculate these measures using beginning and end dates of airline bankruptcies from SDC Platinum.

30

As for the redeployability measures described above, to construct the bankruptcy measures for
a portfolio of aircraft serving as collateral for a particular tranche, we aggregate the aircraft-type
measures across all aircraft in the portfolio. To do so, we calculate the weighted average of the
bankrupt buyer measure corresponding to each of the aircraft in the portfolio. Speciﬁcally, we
calculate:
BankruptBuyersi,t =

S


ωi,t,s (BankruptBuyerss,t )

s

BankruptAircraf ti,t =

S


ωi,t,s (BankruptAircraf ts,t )

s

where i is a tranche, t is a sample date, s denotes an aircraft type, and ωi,t,s is a seat-based
weighting scheme deﬁned as above. Thus, for each tranche collateral pool, this process produces
two measures of bankruptcy induced collateral shocks for each trading day.
Figure A1 provides a timeline of airline bankruptcies in the United States over the sample period.
The ﬁgure displays the timeline of the bankruptcies (on the horizontal axis) against the number
of aircraft operated by the airline on the date the airline ﬁled for bankruptcy. Fifteen airlines
went bankrupt over the sample period, with three of them – TWA, Hawaiian, and US Airways –
going through bankruptcy twice. The average (median) duration of an airline bankruptcy in our
sample is 1.51 (1.35) years. As can be seen from the ﬁgure, the recession that began in March 2001
and the subsequent September 11th, 2001 attacks mark a period of increased bankruptcy activity.
Furthermore, several of the airlines that went bankrupt in the post 9/11 periods were very large
(e.g. United, Delta, Northwest, and US Airways) and involved a large number of aircraft operated
by bankrupt airlines.
Finally, Figure A2 presents the total number of aircraft operated by bankrupt US airlines over
the sample period. The ﬁgure shows how following the recession that started September 11th 2001
the number of aircraft of bankrupt airlines increases dramatically to a maximum of 1,706 aircraft
in 2005 when ATA, Delta, Northwest, United, and US Airways were all in chapter-11. This number
decreases as United exists from bankruptcy in February 2006, and falls further in 2007 as both
Northwest and Delta exit bankruptcy in 2007.

Table 4:
Bankruptcy, Bankrupt Buyers and Tranche Credit Spreads Univariate Analysis
This table provides univariate analysis of tranche credit spreads: Panel A segments credit spreads of tranches of non-bankrupt
and bankrupt airlines, Panel B focuses on non-bankrupt airlines and compares tranche credit spreads of tranches with a positive
bankrupt buyer measure and those with a bankrupt buyers measure equal to zero, while Panel C stratiﬁes the analysis in Panel B
by tranche seniority, and reports means and t-statistics for t-tests on equal means using standard errors that are clustered at the
tranche level.

Table 5:
Bankruptcy and Collateral
The table presents coeﬃcient estimates and standard errors in parentheses for credit spread regressions. Panel A uses the
Bankrupt Buyers measure while Panel B uses the Bankrupt Aircraf t measure. For each speciﬁcation, Panel C of the table
provides estimates of the magnitude of the economic eﬀect of either a one standard deviation move or a 25th to 75th percentile
movement in the Bankrupt Buyers and Bankrupt Aircraf t measures on tranche credit spread. All regressions include an
intercept, yield curve, and default spread controls (Short-rate, Term-spread and Default-spread), and year ﬁxed-eﬀects (not
reported). Standard errors are calculated by clustering at the tranche level. Variable deﬁnitions are provided in Appendix B.
a, b and c denote statistical signiﬁcance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

Table 11:
Bankruptcy and Collateral: Buy vs. Sell Transactions
The table presents coeﬃcient estimates and standard errors in parentheses for credit spread regressions. Regressions are estimated
separately for Buy vs. Sell transactions. All regressions include an intercept, yield curve, and default spread controls (Short-rate, Termspread and Default-spread), and year ﬁxed-eﬀects (not reported). Columns 1, 2, 5, and 6 include airline ﬁxed-eﬀects, and columns 3, 4,
7, and 8 include tranche-ﬁxed eﬀects. Standard errors are calculated by clustering at the tranche level. Variable deﬁnitions are provided
in Appendix B. a, b and c denote statistical signiﬁcance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

Table 12:
Bankruptcy Collateral and Investment Grade
The table presents coeﬃcient estimates and standard errors in parentheses for credit spread regressions. Regressions are estimated separately
for Buy vs. Sell transactions. All regressions include an intercept, yield curve, and default spread controls (Short-rate, Term-spread and
Default-spread), as well as airline and year ﬁxed-eﬀects (not reported). The ﬁrst two columns compare buy vs. sell transactions of tranches
with Moody’s investment grade credit ratings. Columns 3 and 4 compare buy vs. sell transactions of tranches with Moody’s ratings that
are between Aaa and Aa3. Columns 5 and 6 compare buy vs. sell transactions of tranches with Aaa Moody’s credit rating. The last two
columns compare buy vs. sell transactions of tranches with Moody’s investment grade credit ratings for the 1994-2005 period, excluding
the years 2006 and 2007. Standard errors are calculated by clustering at the tranche level. Variable deﬁnitions are provided in Appendix
B. a, b and c denote statistical signiﬁcance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

Table 14:
The Collateral Channel and Airline’s Financial Strength
The table presents coeﬃcient estimates and standard errors in parentheses for credit spread regressions. Regressions are estimated
separately based on seniority (columns 1 vs. 2, and columns 5 vs. 8), and loan-to-value (columns 3 vs. 4, and columns 7 vs. 8). All
regressions include an intercept, yield curve, and default spread controls (Short-rate, Term-spread and Default-spread), as well as tranche
and year ﬁxed-eﬀects (not reported). Standard errors are calculated by clustering at the tranche level. Variable deﬁnitions are provided
in Appendix B. a, b and c denote statistical signiﬁcance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.
