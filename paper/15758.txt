The Return of the Wage Phillips Curve
Jordi Galí
NBER Working Paper No. 15758
February 2010
JEL No. E31,E32
ABSTRACT
The standard New Keynesian model with staggered wage setting is shown to imply a simple dynamic
relation between wage inflation and unemployment. Under some assumptions, that relation takes a
form similar to that found in empirical applications–starting with the original Phillips (1958) curve–and
may thus be viewed as providing some theoretical foundations to the latter. The structural wage equation
derived here is shown to account reasonably well for the comovement of wage inflation and the unemployment
rate in the U.S. economy, even under the strong assumption of a constant natural rate of unemployment.

Introduction

The past decade has witnessed the emergence of a new popular framework
for monetary policy analysis, the so called New Keynesian (NK) model. The
new framework combines some of the ingredients of Real Business Cycle
theory (e.g. dynamic optimization, general equilibrium) with others that
have a distinctive Keynesian ‡avor (e.g. monopolistic competition, nominal
rigidities).
Many important properties of the NK model hinge on the speci…cation
of its wage-setting block. While basic versions of that model, intended for
classroom exposition, assume fully ‡exible wages and perfect competition in
labor markets, the larger, more realistic versions (including those developed
in-house at di¤erent central banks and policy institutions) typically assume
staggered nominal wage setting which, following the lead of Erceg, Henderson and Levin (2000), are modeled in a way symmetric to price setting.1
The degree of nominal wage rigidities and other features of wage setting play
an important role in determining the response of the economy to monetary
and other shocks. Furthermore, the coexistence of price and wage rigidities has important implications for the optimal design of monetary policy.2
Yet, and despite the central role of the wage-setting block in the NK model,
the amount of work aimed at assessing its empirical relevance has been sur1

See, e.g., Smets and Wouters (2003,2008) and Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans
(2005). For a descriptions of versions of those models developed at policy institutions,
see Christo¤el, Coenen, and Warne (2008), Edge, Kiley and Laforte (2007), and Erceg,
Guerrieri and Gust (2006), among others.

See Erceg, Henderson and Levin (2000), Woodford (2003, chapter 6) or Galí (2008,

wage and price stickiness.

prisingly scant.3 This is in stark contrast with the recent but already large
empirical literature on price in‡ation dynamics and …rms’pricing patterns,
which has been motivated to a large extent by the desire to evaluate the
price-setting block of the NK model.4
The present paper seeks to …ll part of that gap, by providing evidence on
the NK model’s ability to account for the observed patterns of wage in‡ation
in the U.S. economy. In order to do so, I reformulate the standard version
of the NK wage equation in terms of a (suitably de…ned) unemployment
rate. The main advantage of that reformulation is the observability of the
associated driving force (the unemployment rate), which contrasts with the
inherent unobservability of the wage markup or the output gap, which are the
driving forces in standard formulations of the NK wage in‡ation equation.
The staggered wage setting model à la Calvo (1983) embedded in standard versions of the New Keynesian framework is shown to imply a simple
dynamic relation between wage in‡ation and the unemployment rate, which
I refer to as the New Keynesian Wage Phillips Curve. Under certain assumptions, that relation takes the same form as the original equation of Phillips
(1958). Furthermore, in the presence of wage indexation to past in‡ation
–an assumption often made in extensions of the basic model– the resulting
wage dynamics are consistent with a speci…cation often used in applied work.
The analysis developed here can thus be seen as providing some theoretical

foundations for those speci…cations, as well as a structural interpretation to
its coe¢ cients.
In the second part of the paper I turn to the empirical evidence, and show
how the New Keynesian Wage Phillips Curve accounts reasonably well for
the behavior of wage in‡ation in the U.S. economy, even under the strong
assumption of a constant natural rate of unemployment. In particular, the
model can account for the strong negative correlation between wage in‡ation
and the unemployment rate observed since the mid-1980s. On the other
hand, the lack of a signi…cant correlation between the same variables for the
postwar period as a whole can be explained as a consequence of the large
‡uctuations in price in‡ation in and around the 1970s, in combination with
wage indexation to past CPI in‡ation.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes
the basic model of staggered nominal wage setting. Section 3 introduces
the measure of unemployment latent in that model, and reformulates the
wage in‡ation equation in terms of that variable. Section 4 provides an
empirical assessment of the model’s implied relation between wage in‡ation
and unemployment using postwar U.S. data. Section 5 concludes.

Staggered Wage Setting and Wage In‡ation Dynamics

This section introduces a variant of the staggered wage setting model originally developed in Erceg, Henderson and Levin (2000; henceforth, EHL).
That model (and extensions thereof) constitutes one of the key building
blocks of the monetary DSGE frameworks that have become part of the
3

toolkit for policy analysis in both academic and policy circles. The variant
presented here assumes that labor is indivisible, with all variations in hired
labor input taking place at the extensive margin (i.e. in the form of variations
in employment). The assumption of indivisible labor leads to a de…nition of
unemployment consistent with its empirical counterpart.
The model assumes a (large) representative household with a continuum
of members represented by the unit square and indexed by a pair (i; j) 2
[0; 1]

[0; 1]. The …rst dimension, indexed by i 2 [0; 1], represents the type

of labor service in which a given household member is specialized. The
second dimension, indexed by j 2 [0; 1], determines his disutility from work.
The latter is given by
'

tj

'

if he is employed and zero otherwise, where

0 determines the elasticity of the marginal disutility of work, and

t

>0

is an exogenous preference shifter. Furthermore, utility is logarithmic in
consumption and there is full risk sharing among household members, as in
Merz (1995).
The household period utility corresponds to the integral of its members’
utilities, and is thus given by

where Ct denotes household consumption, and Nt (i) 2 [0; 1] is the fraction of
members specialized in type i labor who are employed in period t. Below I
discuss the robustness of the main …ndings to a generalization of the previous
utility function that is consistent with (empirically more plausible) smaller
wealth e¤ects on labor supply.

where Pt is the price of the consumption bundle, Wt (i) is the nominal wage
for labor of type i, Bt represents purchases of a nominally riskless one-period
bond (at a price Qt ), and

t

is a lump-sum component of income (which

may include, among other items, dividends from ownership of …rms). The
above sequence of period budget constraints is supplemented with a solvency
condition which prevents the household from engaging in Ponzi schemes.
As in EHL, and following the formalism of Calvo (1983), workers supplying a labor service of a given type (or a union representing them) get to reset
their (nominal) wage with probability 1

w

each period. That probability is

independent of the time elapsed since they last reset their wage, in addition
to being independent across labor types. Thus, a fraction of workers

w

keep

their wage unchanged in any given period, making that parameter a natural
index of nominal wage rigidities. Once the wage has been set, the quantity of
workers employed is determined unilaterally by …rms, with households willingly meeting that demand (to the extent that the wage remains above the
disutility of work for the marginal worker), by sending its specialized workers
with the lowest work disutility.
When reoptimizing their wage in period t, workers choose a wage Wt in
order to maximize household utility (as opposed to their individual utility),
subject to a sequence of isoelastic demand schedules for their labor type,
5

and the usual sequence of household ‡ow budget constraints.5 The …rst
order condition associated with that problem can be written as:

in period t + k, and Mw
with

i.e. wage in‡ation is proportional to the discounted sum of expected deviations of current and future average wage markups from their desired levels.
Intuitively, if average wage markups are below (above) their desired level,
workers that have a chance to reset their wage will tend to adjust it upward
(downward), thus generating positive (negative) wage in‡ation.

Note that the previous equation is the wage analog to the price in‡ation equation
resulting from a model with staggered price setting à la Calvo. See Galí and Gertler
(1999) and Sbordone (2002) for a derivation and empirical assessment.

Estimated versions of the model above found in the literature generally

Wage In‡ation and Unemployment: A New
Keynesian Wage Phillips Curve

Next I introduce unemployment explicitly in the model above.7 Consider
household member (i; j), specialized in type i labor and with disutility of
work

tj

'

. Using household welfare as a criterion, and taking as given current

labor market conditions (as summarized by the prevailing wage for his labor
type), he will …nd it optimal to participate in the labor market in period t if
and only if
Wt (i)
Pt

t Ct

j'

i.e. whenever the real wage prevailing in his trade is above his disutility from
working, expressed in terms of consumption using the household’s marginal
valuation of the latter.
Thus, the marginal supplier of type i labor (employed or unemployed),
which I denote by Lt (i), is implicitly given by
Wt (i)
=
Pt

t Ct Lt (i)

'

Taking logs and integrating over i we obtain
wt
where lt

p t = ct + ' l t +

t

(9)

R1

lt (i)di can be interpreted as the model’s implied aggregate
R1
participation rate, and wt
wt (i)di is the average wage, both expressed

in logs.
7

The general approach builds on Galí (1996). Other recent applications to the New
Keynesian model can be found in Blanchard and Galí (2007) and, more closely related
(although developed independently), Casares (2009).

I de…ne the unemployment rate ut as
ut

lt

(10)

nt

which, for rates of unemployment of the magnitude observed in the postwar
U.S. economy, is a close (and algebraically convenient) approximation to the
more conventional measure (Lt

Nt )=Lt .

Combining (9) and (10) with the expression for the average wage markup
w

(wt

(ct + 'nt + t ) used above yields the following simple linear

relation between the wage markup and the unemployment rate

Let us de…ne the natural rate of unemployment, unt , as the rate of unemployment that would prevail in the absence of nominal wage rigidities. It
follows from the assumption of a constant desired wage markup that unt is
constant and given by

Note that the simple linear relation between the wage markup and unemployment derived in this section holds irrespective of the details of the wage

as described in equation (7). In that case we can derive the implied wage
Phillips curve by combining equations (8) and (11) to obtain:

3.1

Relation to the original wage Phillips curve

In his seminal paper, Phillips (1958) uncovered the existence of a strong inverse empirical relation between wage in‡ation and the unemployment rate
in the U.K. over the period 1861-1957. His analysis was subsequently replicated using U.S. data by Samuelson and Solow (1960), who showed that a
similar empirical relation had been prevalent in the U.S., with the exception
of the New Deal period and the early years of the …rst World War. Much of
subsequent empirical work turned its focus instead to the relation between
price in‡ation and unemployment, usually in the context of a discussion of
NAIRU and its changes (e.g. Gordon (1997) and Staiger, Stock and Watson
(1997)).8
Note that, like the original Phillips (1958) curve, the NKWPC establishes
a relationship between wage in‡ation and the unemployment rate. But two
key di¤erences with respect to Phillips’original curve (and some of its subsequent amendments) are worth emphasizing.
Firstly, (13) is a microfounded structural relation between wage in‡ation and unemployment, with coe¢ cients that are functions of parameters
that have a structural interpretation, and which are independent of the policy regime.9 In particular, the steepness of the slope of the implied wage
8

Gordon (1997) claims that the shift in focus towards price in‡ation has been "deliberate." In his words, "...[t]he earlier …xation on wages was a mistake. The relation of prices
to wages has changed over time...The Fed’s goal is to control in‡ation, not wage growth,
and models with separate wage growth and price markup equations do not perform as well
as the [price in‡ation] equation...in which wages are only implicit...."
9
Needless to say this is only true to the extent that one is willing to take the assumptions
of the Calvo formalism literally, including the exogeneity of parameter w .

11

in‡ation-unemployment curve (given expected wage in‡ation) is decreasing
in the degree of wage rigidity
limit, as

w

w

(which is inversely related to

w ).

In the

approaches zero (the case of full wage ‡exibility), the curve be-

comes vertical. Also, the slope of the (

w

; u) relation is decreasing in the size

of the Frisch labor supply elasticity (which corresponds to the inverse of ').
That structural nature of (13) stands in contrast with the purely empirical
basis of Phillips (1958) original curve, whose only theoretical underpinning
was the plausibility of the principle that "when demand for labour is high
and there are very few unemployed we should expect employers to bid wage
rates up quite rapidly...".10
Secondly, note that (13) implies that wage in‡ation is a forward looking
variable, which is inversely related to current unemployment but also to its
expected future path. This feature, which re‡ects the forward looking nature
of wage setting, is immediately seen by solving (13) forward to obtain
w
t

=

w'

1
X

k

k=0

Et f(ut+k

un )g

(15)

which contrasts with the static, contemporaneous nature of the original
Phillips curve, in which expectations play no role.
Next I brie‡y discuss two extensions of the previous framework. The …rst
one allows for changes over time in desired markups, whereas the second
introduces a speci…cation of preferences that allows for limited short run
wealth e¤ects on labor supply.
10

Phillips (1958) also emphasized the likely existence of nonlinearities due to workers’
reluctance "to o¤er their services at less than the prevailing rates when the demand for
labour is low and unemployment is high, so that wage rates fall only very slowly." In the
analysis of the present paper, as in standard versions of the New Keynesian model, the
possible existence of such asymmetries is ignored.

12

3.2

An Extension with Time-Varying Desired Wage
Markups

Estimated, medium-scale versions of the New Keynesian model often allow
for a time-varying, exogenous desired wage markup, f

w
t g

(see, e.g. Smets

and Wouters (2003, 2007)). In that case, the wage in‡ation equation (shown
in its version without indexation, for simplicity) is given by
w
t

= Et f

w
t+1 g

w
w( t

w
t )

(16)

while the corresponding NKWPC now takes the form
w
t

where unt

w
t

'

= Et f

w
t+1 g

w '(ut

unt )

denotes the (now time-varying) natural rate of unemploy-

ment. Variations in the latter variable, resulting from changes in desired
wage markups, may thus potentially shift the relation between wage in‡ation and the unemployment rate.11
Note that we can also write
w
t
w
w t

vt

= Et f

w 'ut

(17)

The previous speci…cation can be compared against one often

used in the literature which relies on (16) combined with the de…nition of

Equivalently, we can write
w
t

Et f

vt
w t . In contrast with the representation of the wage equation found in Smets
and Wouters (2003, 2007), the error term in the wage in‡ation formulation proposed here
captures exclusively "wage markup shocks," and not preference shocks (even though the
latter have been allowed for in the model above). This feature should in principle allow
one to overcome the basic identi…cation problem raised by Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan
(2008) in their critique of current New Keynesian models.

i.e. it is in‡uenced

by both wage markup shocks and preference shocks. That property contrasts
with (17), whose error term captures exclusively wage markup shocks, but
not preference shocks (even though the latter have been allowed for in the
model). This feature should in principle allow one to overcome the identi…cation problem raised by Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (2008) in their critique
of current New Keynesian models. That potential advantage of the present
formulation is discussed in detail in Galí, Smets and Wouters (2010), who
re-estimate the Smets and Wouters (2007) model using an unemploymentbased wage equation, and re-assess some of the …ndings therein in light of
the new estimates.

3.3

Robustness to a Speci…cation of Preferences with
Limited Short-Run Wealth E¤ects

The assumptions on preferences made above, while analytically convenient,
have implications on labor supply that are rather implausible from an empirical viewpoint. In particular, the strong wealth e¤ects implied by the
logarithmic speci…cation, while seemingly needed in order to remain consistent with balanced growth, are likely to be counterfactual. This becomes
clear by looking at the labor participation equation (9), which implies that
the wage-consumption ratio (wt pt ct ) should be positively correlated to labor participation, at least conditional on shocks other than preference shocks
being the source of ‡uctuations. In postwar U.S. data, and possibly due to
14

the wage rigidities of the kind emphasized in the present paper, wt

pt

ct is

clearly countercyclical, while participation is procyclical (albeit moderately
so). Thus, and unless one is willing to attribute a dominant weight to preference shocks as a source of cyclical ‡uctuations in wages, consumption and
participation, equation (9) provides an unsatisfactory account of ‡uctuations
in the labor force.12
Here I consider a simple extension of the preferences assumed above that
can in principle overcome that problem, by allowing for arbitrarily small
short-run wealth e¤ects while remaining consistent with a balanced growth
path. Thus, individual utility from consumption is now assumed to be given
by

t

log Ct (i; j), where

t

is a preference shifter taken as exogenously given

by each household, but determined by the ratio of aggregate consumption C t
to a measure of its trend level. More precisely, I assume
1 #

Zt = Zt# 1 C t

= C t =Zt where

The derivation of the wage in‡ation equation (5) (or (8), in the presence of indexation) carries over to this case, with the relevant marginal
rate of substitution in the optimal wage setting problem now being given
by M RSt+kjt

(

t+k =

Note, however, that in a symmetric

equilibrium Ct = C t for all t, which allows us to write the equilibrium (log)

where zt

The previous observation is closely related to other implausible predictions of macro
models that rely on similar preferences, including the negative impact on activity of higher

pt = zt + ' lt +

which can be combined to yield the same simple proportional relation between the wage markup and the unemployment rate as above, i.e.

w

Note that the previous speci…cation is still consistent with a balanced growth
path since, in the long run, zt will grow at the same rate as consumption.
In the short run, however, the impact of changes in consumption on the
marginal rate of substitution may be rendered arbitrarily small by increasing
parameter #, thus yielding a more plausible labor supply model. Yet, and
most importantly for the purposes of the present paper, the speci…cation of
the NKWPC in (13) (or (14)) remains una¤ected.13

3.4

A Reduced Form Representation for the NKWPC

Next I derive a simple reduced form representation of the NKWPC, thus
setting the stage for the empirical analysis below. Consider the case of an
exogenous, stationary AR(2) process for the unemployment rate. As discussed below, this process turns out to provide a good approximation to the
13

An identical robustness result can be shown to obtain under a period utility function
of the sort assumed by Jaimovich and Rebelo (2009) with a similar motivation, namely

under the previous assumptions and conditional on the relevant lagged price

negatively to both the level and the …rst di¤erence of the unemployment
rate, with the size of that response being a well de…ned function of structural
parameters, including those characterizing the process for the unemployment
rate.
Interestingly, a speci…cation like (20) has often been proposed and used
in empirical applications, albeit without any strong theoretical justi…cation
17

(e.g. Blanchard and Katz (1999)), as well as in mainstream undergraduate
textbooks (though the latter typically omit lagged unemployment). In fact,
in his seminal paper Phillips (1958) himself argued that it was plausible that
wage in‡ation would depend negatively on both the level and the change of
the unemployment rate, since both captured important dimensions of the
degree of tightness or excess demand in labor markets, and tried to uncover
their joint in‡uence on the unemployment rate.
The following section revisits and updates estimates of equations (19) and
(20) and reinterprets them through the lens of the New Keynesian model
developed above.

Empirical Evidence

The present section provides an empirical assessment of the NKWPC developed above. More speci…cally, I want to evaluate to what extent a version of
the NKWPC with a constant natural rate can account for the joint behavior
of unemployment and wage in‡ation in the U.S. economy.
First, I use simple statistics and graphical tools to seek evidence of a prima
facie negative relationship between wage in‡ation and unemployment of the
sort predicted by the theory. Secondly, I compare the observed behavior
of wage in‡ation with that predicted by an estimated version of the model
above, conditional on the unemployment rate.14
The empirical analysis relies on quarterly postwar U.S. data drawn from
the Haver database. I use the civilian unemployment rate as my measure of

The observability of the unemployment rate, may be viewed as an advantage of the
present framework relative to Sbordone (2006), who focuses instead on a parameterized
version of (5).

unemployment. All measures of price in‡ation are constructed using the consumer price index. There are two main alternative sources for average wage
data that one may use to construct measures of wage in‡ation: the earnings
data for production and nonsupervisory workers from the Establishment Survey (starting in 1964Q1), and the compensation data from the "Productivity
and Costs" publication of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (available from
1948Q1 onwards). Aside from their time span, the main di¤erence between
the two is that "compensation" is a more encompassing measure of the cost
to the employer, and as such it includes employer contributions to employeebene…t plans or irregular bonuses, whereas "earnings" is restricted to wage
income proper (including premium pay for overtime). Unfortunately, and
as noted by several authors, the discrepancy between their implied in‡ation
measures is far from negligible.15 This is made clear by Figure 1, which plots
wage in‡ation based on both measures. Note that in this and subsequent
…gures –though not in the formal econometric work below–wage in‡ation is
measured as the centered four-quarter di¤erence of the log nominal wage expressed in percent terms (i.e., 100*(wt+2

wt 2 )), in order to smooth the

high volatility associated with quarter-to-quarter log-di¤erences.
Three features stand out in Figure 1. First, the two measures display
very similar medium-run patterns, both picking up during the Great In‡ation episode, dropping during the Volcker disin‡ation, and ‡uctuating around
a low and stable mean during the Great Moderation years. This is re‡ected
in their high contemporaneous correlation (0:82). Secondly, their mean values in the common sample period are noticeably di¤erent: 4:44 percent for
15

See, e.g. Abraham, Spletzer and Stewart (1999).

19

the earnings-based measure, 5:36 percent for the compensation-based one.
Finally, and perhaps more strikingly, the compensation-based measure appears far more volatile than the earnings-based measure, especially over the
past two decades. A possible explanation for the di¤erence in volatility lies in
the inclusion of the payo¤s from the exercise of employee stock options in the
compensation measure. As argued by Mehran and Tracy (2001), the impact
of changes in that (increasingly important) component of compensation on
wage in‡ation is substantial, even if it only accounts for a small fraction of
overall compensation.
Interestingly, and those di¤erences notwithstanding, both sources are
used in empirical macro applications, often with little or no discussion regarding the choice. While the compensation-based measure has an advantage in
its longer span, its sizable high frequency variations render it somewhat suspicious, and suggest the presence of substantial measurement error. Thus, in
the empirical analysis below I will use the earnings-based wage in‡ation as a
baseline measure, but will check and discuss the robustness of the main …ndings to the use of the alternative, compensation-based, wage in‡ation measure. Perhaps surprisingly, given the seemingly large di¤erences observed in
Figure 1, none of the key qualitative …ndings in the empirical analysis below
hinge on the choice of wage in‡ation measure.

4.1

A Quick Glance at the Data

The New Keynesian Wage Phillips curve derived in section 3 implies an
inverse relation between wage in‡ation and the unemployment rate, albeit
not a simple or contemporaneous one, especially in the presence of indexation.

20

As a …rst pass in the empirical assessment of the model it seems natural to
check whether the raw data hint at any such an inverse relation.
Figure 2 displays two scatterplots of wage in‡ation and the unemployment rate for the U.S. economy, using both measures of wage in‡ation. The
scatterplots reveal the absence of a stable negative relation between the two
variables. Similar graphs, though typically focusing on price in‡ation, have
often been used to demonstrate "the empirical failure of the Phillips curve."
That visual impression is con…rmed by the correlation between the two series,
which is as low as 0:02 and

0:01, respectively.

Figure 3 displays the evolution of unemployment and wage in‡ation over
time, using the earnings-based measure of the latter. While no stable relation
seems evident at a …rst glance, a more careful examination points to a strong
inverse relation starting sometime around the mid-1980s and prevailing up to
the end of the sample. That inverse relation is con…rmed by the scatterplots
of Figure 4, which are now restricted to the post-1984 period, i.e. the so-called
Great Moderation era. For the restricted sample period the correlations are
0:76 and

0:27, respectively.

Figure 5 adds a temporal dimension to the Phillips curve scatterplots initially shown in Figure 2, now restricted to the earnings-based wage in‡ation
It suggests that the paths of U.S. wage in‡ation and unemployment have
completed a full circle, returning in recent years to the same downward locus
that characterized the 1960s. The evidence thus points to the presence of
a stable negative relation between wage in‡ation and unemployment during
periods of relatively low and stable price in‡ation. That relation is broken
during transitions from low to high in‡ation (early 70s), or from high to low

21

in‡ation (the early 80s), leading to an overall lack of correlation, as suggested
by Figure 2.
Thus, it seems clear from the previous quick glance at the data that
any model that implies a simple inverse relation between wage in‡ation and
unemployment will be at odds with the behavior of those two variables during
the long 1970-1985 episode. Yet, one cannot rule out that extensions of such
a model which allow for indexation to price in‡ation may be consistent with
the evidence. I explore that hypothesis in the next subsection, using the
augmented version of the New Keynesian Wage Phillips curve.
Why has the re-emergence of a stable negative relation between wage in‡ation and unemployment over the past two decades gone unnoticed among
academic economists? A possible explanation lies in the focus on price in‡ation and away from wage in‡ation in much of the empirical research of recent
years, combined with a lack of a signi…cant empirical relation between price
in‡ation and unemployment. The correlation between those two series over
the post-1984 period is low and insigni…cant ( 0:13), and its negative value
is due exclusively to the most recent observations: if I end the sample period
in 2007Q4 the correlation becomes even smaller and with the wrong sign
(0:08). Of course, the theory developed above has nothing to say, by itself,
about the relation between price in‡ation and the unemployment rate, since
that relation is likely to be in‡uenced by factors other than wage setting,
including features of price setting and the evolution of labor productivity,
among others.16
Next I turn to a more formal empirical assessment of the New Keynesian
16

See, e.g. Blanchard and Galí (2009) and Thomas (2009) for an analysis of the relation
between price in‡ation and unemployment in a model with labor market frictions.

Estimates of the Reduced Form New Keynesian
Wage Phillips Curve

In the present subsection I report estimates of the reduced form wage equation (19). The focus on (19) is motivated by the good …t of an AR(2) process
for the unemployment rate. Using data starting in 1948Q1 I estimate the
following model

with any further lags of the unemployment rate not being signi…cant. Thus,
and as discussed above, under that simple univariate process, the wage in‡ation equation should have a negative coe¢ cient on the current unemployment
rate and a positive one on its lag, in addition to a positive coe¢ cient on lagged
price in‡ation in the presence of indexation. Furthermore, the model (19)
implies the cross-equation restriction

1

2,

which can be easily tested

conditional on a value for , which I set to 0:99.
Table 1 reports OLS estimates of several speci…cations of the wage in‡ation equation, each of which can be seen as a restricted version of (19).
The wage in‡ation data is based on the earnings series, and the sample period starts in 1964Q1. The …rst three columns report estimates including
only the current value of the unemployment rate, augmented in the case of
columns (2) and (3) with lagged quarter-to-quarter price in‡ation (column
(2)) and year-on-year price in‡ation (column (3)), with the latter expressed
as a quarterly rate to facilitate comparison of coe¢ cients. Note that when
price in‡ation is not controlled for, the coe¢ cient on unemployment is very
23

close to zero and statistically insigni…cant. When lagged in‡ation is added as
a regressor its coe¢ cient is highly signi…cant, while the coe¢ cient on unemployment increases in absolute value and becomes signi…cant (though only at
the 10 percent level when quarter-to-quarter in‡ation is used as a regressor).
Columns (5) and (6) include the lagged unemployment rate, and are thus
consistent with the speci…cation implied by the model. In both cases the coe¢ cients on the unemployment rates have the sign predicted by the theory,
though they are only signi…cant when year-on-year price in‡ation is used as
the indexing variable. Also, as shown in the row labeled p

value, the cross-

equation restriction speci…ed above cannot be rejected when both equations
are estimated jointly. The …nal two rows report the implied estimates of
the Calvo wage rigidity parameter
and

since the three parameters are not separately identi…ed. Note that

' is the inverse Frisch labor supply elasticity, a controversial parameter. I

of values often assumed in the literature. Given ', I use (12) to set

w

to a

value consistent with a natural rate of unemployment of 5 percent, which is
roughly the average unemployment rate over the sample period considered.17
The point estimates range from 0:62 to 0:89, suggesting substantial wage
rigidities, with those associated with the ' = 5 calibration implying average
durations that may be viewed as implausibly long (though the non-negligible
size of the standard errors allow for more plausible underlying degrees of
wage rigidity).

ported in columns (5) and (6), suggests a poor …t during the recent recession.
The reason is simple: the rapid increase in the unemployment rate and the
very low levels of price in‡ation (which became de‡ation for some quarters),
lead the …tted wage equation to predict substantial nominal wage de‡ation.
While actual wage in‡ation was brought down by the recession, it has always
remained positive. The presence of downward nominal wage rigidities, which
are ignored in the standard wage setting model developed above, could in
principle account for that poor …t. Motivated by that observation, columns
(7) and (8) in Table 1 report estimates of the wage equation using data up to
2007Q4, thus avoiding any distortion resulting from the use of recent data.
Note that for both speci…cations, the coe¢ cients on current and lagged unemployment increase substantially and now become highly signi…cant even
when quarter-to-quarter price in‡ation is used as a regressor. Figure 6 displays actual and …tted wage in‡ation, using the estimates shown in column
(8). While the estimated model misses much of the high frequency variations,
it appears to capture well most movements at medium-term frequencies, with
the exception of the spikes in 1971-72 and 1976-77. The correlation between
the two series is 0:83.
Table 2 reports estimates of wage in‡ation equations using the measure
based on compensation, and with the sample period starting in 1948Q1. Most
of the …ndings in Table 1 appear to be robust to the use of the alternative
wage in‡ation measure, which is indeed surprising given the large discrepancies between the two in‡ation measures. Note however that the exclusion of
post-2007 data does not have much of an impact now, possibly because of
its reduced weight in the longer sample period. In particular, the coe¢ cients

25

on unemployment and its lagged value in column (5) are now signi…cant, in
addition of having the right pattern of signs and relative magnitude.

4.3

A Measure of Fundamental Wage In‡ation in the
Spirit of Campbell-Shiller

The previous subsection reported estimates of a reduced form wage in‡ation equation implied by the NKWPC, under the assumption that the unemployment rate follows an exogenous AR(2) process. While the previous
assumption provides a fairly good approximation to the dynamics of unemployment in the postwar period and leads to a reduced form speci…cation
which makes contact with that used in Phillips (1958) and in subsequent
applied work, one may legitimately wonder whether the favorable empirical assessment of the NKWPC hinges on that assumption. Relaxing that
assumption has an additional justi…cation: simple Granger-causality tests
reject the null of no-Granger causality from wage and price in‡ation to unemployment. Thus, in particular, the four lags of (earnings-based) wage
in‡ation and price in‡ation are signi…cant at the one percent level in a regression of the unemployment rate on its own four lags and the lags of the
two in‡ation measures over the 1964Q1-2009Q3 sample period. An analogous
test using the compensation-based measure of wage in‡ation and extended
over the sample period 1948Q1-2009Q3 only rejects the null of no-Granger
causality at the 7 percent signi…cance level.
Motivated by the previous observation, and in the spirit of Campbell
and Shiller’s (1987) proposed assessment of present value relations, I start
by de…ning the following measure of "fundamental" or "model-based" wage

Under the null hypothesis that model (19) is correct, it is easy to check that
ew
t ( ) =

for all t. In other words, given the structure of the conditioning

variable zt the use of a limited information set is not restrictive under the
null.

Next I estimate ew
t ( ) and plot it against actual wage in‡ation, to eval-

uate the extent to which the simple model developed here can explain observed ‡uctuations in that variable. I assume that the joint dynamics of

unemployment and wage in‡ation are well captured by the …rst order vector
autoregressive model
zt = A zt

where Ef"t j zt 1 g = 0 for all t. Thus, and letting ei denote the ith unit

and the OLS estimate

for matrix A (with q = 4). As in the empirical analysis above I use lagged
quarterly and annual in‡ation as an indexing variable, and both earningsbased and compensation-based measures of wage in‡ation.
Table 3 reports the main results for the exercise.18 The estimates of ,

the degree of indexation, are always highly signi…cant and lie between 0:52
and 0:83, depending on the speci…cation, values which are slightly higher
than those obtained in the previous subsection. The point estimates for the
Calvo parameter

w

are also highly signi…cant in all cases. Under the ' = 1

assumption they lie between 0:52 and 0:65, implying an average duration
between two and three quarters. When ' = 5 is assumed, the estimates are
substantially higher (between 0:75 and 0:82), but still within the range of
plausibility, given the evidence uncovered by micro studies.19 Interestingly,
my estimates for

and

w

are very close to those obtained by Smets and

Wouters (2007) using a very di¤erent approach (and one that does not use
information on the unemployment rate, among other di¤erences): 0:58 and
0:7, respectively.
The "multivariate" model analyzed here implies some restrictions that
can be subject to formal testing. In particular, note that if the model holds

Standard errors are obtained by drawing from the empirical distribution of A, and
re-estimating w and for each draw.

e01 = e02 A

Unfortunately the previous set of restrictions is rejected at very low signi…cance levels for our sample and baseline calibration. This may not be
surprising, given the simplicity of the model. But, following Campbell and
Shiller (1987), I seek a more informal evaluation of the model by comparing
actual and fundamental wage in‡ation. The last row of Table 3 displays
the correlation between the four-quarter centered moving averages of both
variables: the correlations are positive and high (above 0:75) in all cases,
suggesting a good …t of the model. This is also illustrated in Figure 7, which
displays actual (earnings-based) wage in‡ation and fundamental wage in‡ation, where the latter is based on the estimates using annual price in‡ation
as an indexing variable and ' = 1. While the …t is far from perfect, it is
clear that the model-based series captures pretty well the bulk of the low and
medium frequency ‡uctuations in actual wage in‡ation (with the exception of
some episodes, including the 2008-09 recession). The fact that such a good …t
is obtained using a model for wage in‡ation that assumes a constant natural
rate of unemployment makes that …nding perhaps even more surprising.
Given the large ‡uctuations in price in‡ation over the sample period
considered and the well known positive correlation between price and wage
in‡ation, one may wonder to what extent the high correlation between actual and fundamental in‡ation is largely a consequence of indexation to past
price in‡ation. In order to address that question I construct a measure of the
"cyclical" component of fundamental in‡ation, by subtracting from the latter
p
t 1.

the in‡ation indexation component,
29

The cyclical component is thus

driven exclusively by current and anticipated future unemployment rates.
Figure 8 displays the cyclical component of fundamental in‡ation thus constructed, together with actual wage in‡ation. It is clear from that evidence
that while the cyclical component did not have a dominant role in accounting
for the ‡uctuations in wage in‡ation in the Great In‡ation era, one can still
detect several episodes in which it shapes the shorter-term ‡uctuations in observed wage in‡ation, including the 1968-69 hump and the 1974-75 trough.
It is not until the advent of the Great Moderation period and the associated
stability in price in‡ation that the cyclical component of fundamental wage
in‡ation emerges as a central factor behind ‡uctuations in wage in‡ation, as
Figure 8 makes clear.

Concluding comments

In his seminal 1958 paper, A.W. Phillips uncovered a tight inverse relation
between unemployment and wage in‡ation in the U.K.. That relation was
largely abandoned on both theoretical and empirical grounds. From a theoretical viewpoint, it was not clear why the rate of change of the nominal
wage (as opposed to the level of the real wage) should be related to unemployment. From an empirical viewpoint, economists’attention shifted to the
relation between price in‡ation and unemployment, but hopes of establishing
a stable relationship between those variables faded with the stag‡ation of the
1970s.
The present paper has made two main contributions. First, it provides
some theoretical foundations to a Phillips-like relation between wage in‡ation
and unemployment. It does so not by developing a new model but, instead, by
30

showing that such a relation underlies a standard New Keynesian framework
with staggered wage setting, even though versions of the latter found in
the literature do not explicitly incorporate or even discuss unemployment.
Secondly, the implied wage equation is shown to account reasonably well for
the comovement of wage in‡ation and the unemployment rate in the U.S.
economy, even under the strong assumption of a constant natural rate of
unemployment. In particular, that equation can explain the strong negative
comovement between wage in‡ation and unemployment observed during the
past two decades of price stability.
It is far from the objective of the present paper to claim that the staggered wage setting model of Erceg, Henderson and Levin (2000) provides
an accurate description of U.S. labor markets. It is clear that some of its
underlying assumptions,–most noticeably, the unilateral setting of the wage
by a monopoly union–are at odds with arrangements prevailing in most sectors. Yet, as a matter of fact, the EHL structure underlies most of the
medium-scale DSGE models that have been developed in recent years, by
both academics and institutions. Identifying and testing further predictions
coming out of those models would seem a worthy undertaking and a source of
guidance in any e¤ort to improve the frameworks available for policy analysis.
This is, if nothing else, the spirit of the present paper.
