Collective Bargaining Laws and
Threat Effects of Unionism in the
Determination of Police Compensation
ABSTRACT

This study examines the effect of public sector unions on compensation

packages. The model of the compensation determination process incorporates

institutional aspects of public sector labor relations, particularly
the differences in collective bargaining laws across states. The model is estidistinctive

mated using

data on over 800 municipal police departments. Our results indicate

that the effect of public sector unions depend critically on these institutional

features of the public sector. First, unionism thrives only in those states
with protective legislation. Second, in states where unionism has flourished,
unionism exerts a strong upward pressure on both union and nonunion compensation

packages. Cross section estimates for 1978 indicate that salaries of union and
nonunion departments in highly unionized states are some 30% higher than are the

salaries in states with low levels of unionism. However, no significant difference between union and nonunion salaries within states is observed.

Before—after estimates of the "state—wide union effect" are more

modest (9.9% to 18.1%). Finally, this "state—wide union effect" on union and
nonunion departments appears to 'be even more pronounced on fringe benefits than

it is on salaries. The net result is that in highly unionized states, a greater
proportion

of the larger compensation packages is paid in fringe benefits.

In spite of well—known institutional differences between public sector
and private sector collective bargaining, many studies of the effect of unionization on public sector compensation have essentially followed the private sec-

tor model, estimating union effects by comparing the wages of organized and

unorganized workers or cities. For the most part these studies have found
rather modest union wage effects in the public sector. "The 'average' wage
effect of unionism in government... is roughly on the order of five per cent...
smaller than the average union wage impact in private industry."1 "The general
effects (of public sector unions) which have been measured are not huge."2
This study presents an alternative model of public sector union effects

on compensation which yields larger estimates of what unions do to compensation

in the public sector. The model incorporates two distinct aspects of public
sector labor relations that should affect unions' ability to raise wages.

First are differences in collective bargaining laws across states: the fact
that some states have duty—to—bargain laws that encourage unionism, while others
have legal environments that discourage or even outlaw bargaining among certain

groups of employees. Second, city managers, unlike private employers, are
charged with the responsibility of administering public policies. Where a state
has a duty—to—bargain policy then, municipal managers will not be in a position
to oppose unionism through aggressive anti—union campaigns of the type seen in

the private sector. We argue that because of these factors public sector
unionism proliferates in states with favorable bargaining laws, and that in
these states union wages 'spill over' to nonunion cities, leading standard union
wage equations to underestimate union wage effects.

We conduct our analysis using data on over 800 municipal police depart-

ments in 19T8 and a smaller sample in 1965 and l9T3. We find that differences

—2—

in laws regulating police collective bargaining produce two polar sets of states

—— those with high levels of bargaining between municipalities and their police
departments and those in which police bargaining is virtually nonexistent.

Furthermore, differences in the average police salaries (all else fixed) in

'bargaining' and 'non bargaining' states are on the order of 20 to 25%. By
contrast, comparisons of organized and unorganized departments within the
"bargaining"

and "nonbargaining" states reveal little or no difference between

salaries paid in organized departments and those paid in unorganized depart—
ments.

Our interpretation of these

bargaining

results is that in the absence of a

law virtually all departments will remain nonunion with wages

remaining at relatively low nonunion levels, but that in public sector environ-

ments where collective bargaining is the dominant mechanism for determining compensation, there are greater spillover effects than are usually found in the
private sector.3
Direct and Threat Effects of Public Sector Bargaining
In this section we present a simple model of the inter—relation among
legal regulations, public sector unionism, and direct and 'spillover' effects of

unionism on compensation. The key prediction of our model is that in states
where union organization is high (because of favorable laws) unionism will raise

police pay in nonunion as well as in union departments. In states where
unionism is weak (because of unfavorable laws), unionism will have only a modest
effect on salaries in organized departments and no effect on salaries in unorganized departments.

Consider first the situation in a state with laws favorable to collec-

tive bargaining among police. A city in such a state fa'es the three options
shown in Figure 1.

—3—

Path A: It accepts organization and raises wages through bargaining
with the amount of the wage increases dependent on the union's economic or
political power relative to that of the city government.

Path B: It seeks to remain non union by paying union wages to discourage
organization; unlike private firms, city managers who are charged with the
responsibility- of administering public policies, cannot engage in expensive,

often illegal campaigns against unions to remain nonunion.

Path C: It does not accept organization immediately but also does not
match the increased levels in union departments. In a state with favorable laws
the city runs a great risk of becoming organized over time, producing a transitory and unstable state.

Since in the long run only nonunion cities that match union wages remain
nonunion, the indirect spillover effects of unionism are as large as the direct
bargaining effects.

Consider next the effect of unionism in states which lack a law per-

mitting collective bargaining. In the absence of a law, there will be no mecha-

nism by which employees are able to become recogni.ed formally. If workers
organize

a

union, managers may ignore any requests or demands to bargain on the

grounds that no agent has the authority to participate in the compensation

determination process. In such a setting cities are unlikely to be organized.
Where a union does exist, the city government will have much greater bargaining
power than the union, while cities which are not organized need not copy union

wages to remain nonunion. In this environment, direct effects of unionism

should be small and there should be no indirect spillover effects.
The spillover or threat nxdel just described yields several hypotheses

will be tested in this study. First, formal collective bargaining should
be concentrated in states that have bargaining statutes or policies. Second, if
indirect "threat" effects of collective bargaining are equal in magnitude to the
that

direct effect of bargaining, salaries and wages in union and nonunion departments in the states with bargaining laws will be equivalent, but at levels of
compensation exceeding the levels observed in states without bargaining laws.

Third, the novement of a state from little unionization toconsiderable unionization should greatly raise the average pay for all police in the state.

Fourth, low wage nonunion municipalities in a state with a bargaining law should
be highly prone to unionization in the future. Fifth, unionism should, have only
modest direct and no indirect effects on pay in states where collective
bargaining is legally discouraged.
Data

To test these hypotheses we have gathered 1978 compensation and unionism

data for over 800 municipalities with populations over 10,000. So that we could
also examine changes over time, we collected data for a smaller sariple of

just under 200 cities with populations greater than 25,000 for the years 1965

and 1913. For each year, we have obtained patrolman's minimum and maximum
salary

and the average departmental salary.

In

1978 we have also obtained two

fringe benefit measures: per employee contributions to retirement systems, and
per employee contribution to health and life insurance programs.
To test how well the path model in the previous section describes the
effects of public sector unions on the compensation determination process,

—6—

several variables are needed to describe the collective bargaining environment

at the municipal and state levels. Previous research on the public sector indicates that a written labor contract is a better indicator of the presence of
the collective bargaining process than is a union local or association.5

To

collect contract data, we conducted a survey in which we asked the following two

questions: "Does your city have a written labor contract covering wages, hours
and conditions of employment for police personnel?", and "What year was the

first written labor contract signed?" It is assumed that cities responding
affirmatively to the first question have been party to a police contract con-

tinually since the date given in response to the second question. Collective
bargaining for police department I in year t is defined by the presence of a
written labor contract (Cit; c=i,o) based on this survey.

From the municipal—level variable C, we derive the state—level
variable, PCst: the percentage of all municipalities in state s that have writ-

ten labor contracts in year t. Responses from 985 municipalities that answered
the contract questions are used to calculate PC in any given year.
Also critical to the path model are state—level collective bargaining

policies or laws. In this study, LAW is a dummy variable which equals one if
there is a policy in the state (as defined by statute, court rulings, or state
attorney general's opinions) providing that collective bargaining for police is
permitted in the state.6
Control Variables

Since LAW and PC are defined along state boundaries, it is important to
control for other state—wide characteristics that might influence police compen—

—7-.

sation. Other state characteristics included in the analysis are: four
geographic region durnx variables (northeast, north central, south, and west),

the percentage of a state's nonagricultural workforce who are public employees
in 1970, and the percentage of a states' nonagricultural workforce who are union
members in 1970.

In addition to state controls, we include various municipal—

level characteristics: three government—type dummies (council—manager, mayor—
council, and commission), a central city dummy, population, per capita income,

total municipal revenue per capita. For a smaller sample of cities, information
was also available on: the salary paid to craft and kindred workers as a
measure of alternate salary available to police; serious crime rate; median education level in the municipality; percentage black in the population; and land

area.7 When these additional control variables are included in analyses for
1978, the sample excludes smaller towns with populations between 10,000 and
25,000 and is reduced from just over 800 observations to under 200.

At the municipal level, ability—to—pay measures, such as income per
capita and municipal revenue per capita, are expected to have a positive effect

on salaries. A number of variables, such as central city, median education,
percent black, land area and population, are included as controls for differen-

ces in needs or tastes (and therefore demand) for police services The salary
paid to craft—and—kindred workers should affect the supply of workers available
for police work and should therefore have a positive influence on police

salaries. Because independent and dependent variables come from different
sources, the data do not always pertain to identical years across variables,
but all independent variables are matched as closely as possible with the years
of the compensation data.

Because the dependent contract status variable (C15) is binary we esti-

mate equation (i) with a logistic fanction. From our model we expect that the
LAW will be the major determinant of contract status of a city and, therefore,

of the proportion of cities with contracts in a state. Since LAW is a state—
level variable, however, there is danger that its effects could 'be overstated

due to possible omission of unobserved state effects correlated with LAW and

with unionization. To deal with this problem, we also estimate first difference
equations, examining the change in contract status within a city or state over

time. Such differencing removes unobserved fixed state effects:

where some state and city variables change over time and others do not.

Figure

over time and the relation between contract status and state laws. It documents
the

sharp increase in the number of states with laws favorable to collective

bargaining and a concordant increase in the levels of unionization. What
stands out is the movement of the police labor market from one with essentially

(though not all) states with laws and little unionization in those without laws.

Logistic equation estimates of equations 1 and 2 are given in Table 1.
The coefficients on the LAW variable show that as hypothesized, passage of a
collective bargaining law does, indeed, lead to collective bargaining contracts

in police departments. Both the cross—section and longitudinal regressions find
significant positive effects on the law (change in law) variable. More detailed
analysis using panel data from 1955 to l9T8 on these cities reveals that much of
the growth in municipal police unionization occurs in the first few years after
the passage of state bargaining laws.8

Our model also suggests that in the frequent cases where state bargaining laws have encouraged municipal unionization, wages of union and nonunion

departments are both raised. Therefore, in equation (3), we expect b2 to be positive and significant. In the absence of state legislation, the rare department
that has unionized will have only limited ability to raise wages. In highly
unionized states with favorable bargaining legislation, nonunion departments have
wages comparable to the wages in union departments because of the importance of

threat effects in these environments. With and without state legislation, union
and nonunion departments will have comparable salaries, so that b1

0. In this

analysis, b2 measures how much an increase in the level of state unionization
will influence both union and nonunion departments and is therefore our first

estimate of the threat effect. b1 is the additional wage premium enjoyed

solely by union departments. The total effect of unionization on a union
department

is given by the sum of b1 and b2.

Estimates of how these different

kinds of union effects depend upon the presence of state legislation will be
obtained

by estimating equation (3) separately for the subsainpies of cities in

states with and without bargaining laws.

Table 2 presents estimated coefficients on key variables for the cross—

section equation (3)9 Entering the municipal—level contract variable (ci) as
the only union measure replicates the form of the equation most commonly esti-

mated to gauge the effect of public sector unions on compensation. In 1978 the
coefficient on C indicates that union departments receive 11% higher salaries
than do nonunion departments. When this equation is replicated for 1973 (column
6) and for 1965

public

(column 8),

one observes a result found in some other studies on

sector union wage effects: the simple cross—section union effect is

modest but becomes larger in later time periods.10 The 1965 cross—section estimate is in fact negative (—.029); in 1973, the contract effect is .OltO; and by
1978 it is .107.

In column 2 and 3, one observes that the PC and LAW

coefficients,

entered separately, are both significant and positive. The coefficient on PC is
nearly two and one—half the size of the CONTRACT coefficient in column 1. When
the three union measures are entered simultaneously (column )4), only the coef-

ficient on PC remains significant and positive. The PC coefficient from the
column )4 specification suggests that both union and nonunion police departments

in states that are almost entirely organized receive salaries some 30 higher
than those paid to police departments in states that are generally unorganized.

on Natural Logarithm of Average Police Department Salarya

— l4 —

Our interpretation of why the LAW coefficient in column

is negligible is that

a bargaining policy which, for whatever reason, does not produce an increase in
the number of negotiated contracts for municipal police departments (as in
Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, North Dakota, and Vermont) does not

itself raise salaries. An examination of regression diagnostics for multi—
collinearity for the equation in column I reveals, moreover, that the LAW and PC
(and therefore C) variables are highly collinear making It unlikely that we

would obtain well—defined estimates of both effects."
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the column 1 specification indicates that coefficient on C is no longer significantly different from zero once

PC is also entered. The simple contract (union) effect (column 1 specification)
usually estimated in studies of public sector union wage effects seems to be
entirely due to the greater representation of organized departments (those with

a contract) in highly organized states (those with high levels of nc). These
results indicate that salaries in nonunion departments are as high as those paid
in union departments.

Smaller samples, columns (5) through (9), give results for the smaller

sample of cities of 25,000 or more. The regression findings for 19T8 are not
changed appreciably when the more detailed set of municipal controls are added
that limit the sample to cities and towns with populations greater than 25,000
(column 5).

Similarly, for the cities in the 1973 sample, the results are much the

same. The modest positive contract coefficient (.o10) in column 6 is reduced to
zero once the state—level union measures are also entered in the equation

—15—

(column 7). However, in 1973 the LAW as well as the PC variable affects
salaries, which may be attributed to its representing a period of transition or
sorting period from an environment with very little unionization (1965) to an
environment of union states and nonunion states (1978).

To obtain an estimate of the difference between average salaries in states with and without laws in 1973, one can use the column 7 coefficients to
calculate:

In

1973 the average level of PC for the 27

with a law was .520; the average value of PC for the 23 states without a

law was .122. This calculation indicates that the difference in police salaries
between the average state with a law and the average state without a law would

be iO.I% [i.e., (.063) +

(.1o2)(.520)

—

(.1o2)(.122)].

Again, the 1973 results

indicate that even as cities and states were in this period of transition,
"union states" had significantly higher police salaries than "nonunion states",

but that within states there was no difference between the salaries of union an
nonunion departments.

For 1965, when the state-level unionization measures, LAW and PC, are
entered in the equation (column 9), LAW has a significant positive coefficient,

while the PC variable obtains a large negative coefficient. As Figure 2 indicated, police unionization by any state—level or municipal—level measure was not

yet an accepted practice. Only 4.8% of all departments had labor contracts.
Thirty five states had no police unionization (Pcro); and the maximum value of

PC in 1965 was only .375. The PC coefficient, while large and negative,

translates into very small inter—state differences in average police compen-

sation. The positive LAW coefficient is also misleading. Supplementary analysis which probe at the nature of the LAW

coefficient

reveals that of the four

states with any kind of bargaining policies in 1965 (California, North Dakota,
Rhode Island, and Wisconsin) only California has high police salaries.

Taking all of these results as a whole, the cross—section estimates reveal no
consistent evidence of positive effects of any of the municipal or state—level
collective bargaining variables in 1965 —— a. period in which police unionization
was virtually nonexistant.

Splitting the sample by LAW

The cross—section estimates so far support our model's predictions that
unionized states have higher average police salaries than nonunion states, but
that no differences exist between the pay of union and nonunion departments

within any state. Table 3 goes a step further in testing our model of spillover
effects by examining contract coefficients obtained in separate equations for

law and no law subsamples. For our 1918 large sample there are enough observations to split the sample into states with and without laws and still have

contract and noncontract cities in both subsamples. Among no law states, the
contract coefficient is modest but positive (.055). In the previous equations
that included both the C and PC variables, the point estimates of the contract
effect had 'been slightly negative. Among no law states, union departments

do appear to earn a very modest positive salary differential. However, smili
differences in the PC variable between states in the no law sample do no signi—

ficantly affect average state salaries. Among states with laws, the coef—

—18—

ficients on C (—.023) and PC (.295) are both similar to the coefficients from
the total sample reported in Table 2 (Column 1 specification).

In evaluating the coefficients from the no law sample, it should be
noted that only fourteen of the 206 municipalities (6.8%) in no law environments

in 1978 have contracts. In contrast, 130 of the 616 municipalities (21.1%) in
states with laws in 1978 do not have contracts. The rare occurrence of a municipality having a contract in a no law state may well indicate that without the
protection of a bargaining law and without some provision or mechanism for
becoming organized, managers need not respond to employee demands for collective

bargaining. This explanation is also supported by the fact that in nine of the
fourteen cities that have contracts in no—law states, local legislatures adopted
a local ordinance providing for collective bargaining the year before the

negotiation of the first written contract. Interviews with managers from the
other five municipalities indicated that those cities have a strong union
influence in private sector employment that has made collective bargaining a

widely accepted practice in the area. Weirton, West Virginia and Huntington,
West Virginia are communities with strong influences from the steel workers and

mine workers respectively. Pascagoula, Mississippi (the only municipality with
a contract in a state in which police collective bargaining is explicitly illegal by state statute) has a number of craft unions representing workers in its
dominant industry ——

shipbuilding.

Once these rare departments are able to

obtain formal recognition and a written contract, the power of the union to

raise wages would still appear to be quite limited. In these states, public
managers do not respond to any demands for collective bargaining; in the rare

—19—

cases when formal bargaining does exist (usually with the protection of local
ordinances), public managers do not appear to respond to any appreciable extent
to demands during collective bargaining.
Longitudinal

Analyses

While these initial cross—section results lend support to our model the

question naturally arises: to what extent is the significant coefficient on PC
evidence

of a powerful union threat effect and to what extent does it reflect

omitted state characteristics? Just as the unionization equations could suffer

problems of omitted variable bias, so too can equation 3. In particular,

from

if

0,

E(e5PC)

estimation of equation 3 will lead to an overstatement of the

coefficient on PC5. To deal with this problem we again hypothesize an omitted
city—specific effect (which may be the same for all cities in a given state) in
a cross—section equation for period 1.

reason is that the timing of unionization was selective with unions first orga-

nizing areas in which they could raise wages most. In both cases, the fact that
PC variable is positively correlated with salaries or salary growth suggests
that nonunion as well as unionized departments benefit from increased unionization in the state environment.

Union Threat Equation
According to the path model in Figure 1 of Section II, a city in a

unionized environment can remain nonunion only by raising wages. A nonunion
city that does not match union wage gains is in the unstable state depicted by
path C of Figure 1. These cities run a particularly high risk of becoming orga-

nized. It is the strength of this threat that leads to the similarity between
union and nonunion salaries in the "union states."

This additional hypothesis

of the path model suggests the following hazard function equation:

where the expression on the right hand side of the equation is a standardized
measure of the difference between the wage in nonunion city I and the average
wage in state s.

To estimate equation (i) we calculated the number of standard deviations

a particular departments salary is away from the mean salary in its own state
(DEvsAL),

then

estimated a logistic equation for the probability of negotiating

a first contract in 1978 (i.e., the hazard rate of unionization in 1978).12 The
independent variables include LAW, DEVSAL, and an interaction term LAW * DEVSAL.
The results from this analysis are shown in Table 5.

the law variable in line 1 reinforces the results from the unionization equation

in Table 1. A municipality that does not have a contract at the start of the
year is much more likely to get its first contract during the year if It is In a

state with a LAW. From the logit coefficient in line 2 It appears that within
states with laws, a municipality is more likely to become organized during the
year if the police salaries it is paying at the beginning of the year13 are low

relative to other police salaries in its state. From the logit coefficient on
DEVSAL in line 3 of Table 3, it appears that paying relatively low salaries does

not lead to any increased risk of unionization in no law sates. It would
therefore appear that if a municipality in the states with bargaining laws do
not continue to respond to the threat of unionization, the department is likely
to begin to bargain collectively- to raise salaries.

Interviews provided further evidence on the threat of unionization if

salaries in nonunion departments slip below the level of union—salaries. For
example, out of thirty—one municipalities from Minnesota in this sample, only

Fairmont, Minnesota does not have a contract with its police department. In
discussing the determination of police salaries in this town, a management
representative of Fairmont said he has to match the salaries and benefits of the

unionized departments, adding: "Any one of these years, if our police don't
like the [compensation] package..., we're going to have collective bargaining."

The threat effect also appears to operate when police unionization Is at

somewhat lower levels as well. A management representative from Centerville,
Ohio (PC = .60 In 19T8) wrote on our contract status survey-: "Of all the cities

with a population over 5,000 in the Dayton area, Centerville is the only one

—25--

without union representation for the police department. Management is
constantly striving to keep salary levels and work procedures current so as to

give no reason for the officers to seek formal representation." While this last
response indicates that the threat effect in Ohio operates within regions or

SMSAs (as suggested by Ehrenberg and Goldstein)1 the presence of a threat
effect is certainly supported by such comments.
Fringe Benefits
One additional aspect of how public sector unionization affects the corn—.

pensation determination process can be addressed with our data: the effect of
the various measures of public sector unionization on fringe benefits. For
1978, we also obtained data on employer contributions to retirement and

insurance programs. While detailed change—over—time analyses are not possible,
the cross—section compensation equations of Section IV can be replicated using
the natural logarithm of fringe benefits per employee as the dependent variable.

Table 6 presents the coefficients of the three measures of public sector

bargaining, C, pc, and LAW, in fringe benefit equations. The column 1 specification replicates the basic average salary equation (Table 2, column 14),

but

with a slightly reduced sample. The change in sample again does not affect the
basic result: states with high levels of unionization (PC9) have relatively
high salaries, but within states there is no significant difference between the

salaries in contract and non contract cities. Column 2 estimates an equation
for the determinants of total compensation (defined as salary plus fringe

benefits). The PC coefficient in the column 2 total compensation equation is
somewhat larger than the PC coefficient in the column 1 salary equation. This

would indicate a somewhat larger effect of state unionization on fringe benefits

than on salaries. The results from the fringe benefit equation in columns (3)
through (6) also support the hypothesis that state unionization measures have a

larger effect on fringe benefits than on salaries. Absent any state—level
measures of unionization, contract cities appear to pay significantly higher

fringe benefits than non contract cities. Once PC is also included (column 6),
one sees the same pattern observed in the salary equations in Table 2: uninici—
palities in states with high levels of unionization pay significantly higher
fringe benefits than do iminicipalities in generally 'nonunion' states but no

significant difference between fringe benefits paid in contract and noncontract
municipalities. Moreover, the PC effect on fringe benefits (column 6) is nearly

double the effect of PC on salaries. These results further suggest that cities
in states with high levels of police unionization have compensation packages

more heavily weighted toward fringe benefits than salaries. In column (T), the
ratio of fringe benefits to total compensation is used as a dependent variable

to illustrate this point more directly. The coefficient on PC is positive and
significant. The magnitude of the coefficient suggests that when a state is
entirely unionized (PC=l.O), municipal police departments in the state will have
2.3% more of their compensation package made up of fringe benefits than do
police departments in virtually nonunion states (pc=o.o).
Conclusion

The model developed in this paper and the various empirical equations
estimated to test that model suggest that the effect of unionization on compensation in the public sector depends on a number of environmental and institutional features:

—28—

1. In environments where unionization is rare in the public sector
(i.e. in states which do not have legal provisions permitting

bargaining), unionization has little impact on compensation. This
principle is illustrated by the absence of any sort of union
effect on compensation in 1965 in the United States when only 14.8%
of

all municipal police departments engaged in collective

bargaining and only four states had any legal provisions for

collective bargaining. This principle Is also illustrated by the
very modest Impact of collective bargaining in 1978 in states
without bargaining laws.
departments

In

these environments, only 6.8°

bargained (almost always with

of all

the protection of

municipal—level bargaining ordinances), and the "union effect" on
salaries here was 5.5%.

2. In environments where collective bargaining Is the dominant mecha-

nism by

which compensation is determined

protective

(usually in states with

legislation), unionization exerts a strong upward

pressure on salaries on both union and nonunion departments.
Because of the threat effect of unionization on salaries in nonunion departments, a simple comparison of salaries in union and
nonunion

departments does not reveal the full "union effect." Our

cross—section

estimate

estimates for 1978

provide an upper bound of the

of the effect of unionization on salaries in union and

nonunion departments (29.7). Our "before—after" estimates of
this "union effect" are somewhat more modest (9.9% to 18.1%).

—29—

While police departments in highly unionized states pay much
higher salaries than do departments in nonunion states, there
appears to be no salary differential enjoyed solely by unionized
departments in the highly organized states.

3. Finally, the "union effect" on fringe benefits appears to be even

greater than the effect on salaries. The net result is that in

packages is paid in fringe benefit contributions to health

and retirement plans.

The results here suggest the value of developing models specific to the
public sector for analysing union wage effect rather than simply replicating

models used in the private sector. They also point out certain interesting
puzzles, which merit further attention. In particular, while bargaining laws
almost always lead to increased municipal organIzation, there are still six sta—
tes where bargaining policies have not lead to a majority of the states' munici-

palities being organized. While these six states (Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana,
New Mexico, North Dakota, and Vermont) have "weaker" meet—and-confer sorts of
laws, other states with these weaker provisions have seen significant increases

in the proportion of police departments that harain. And finally, if' municipal
organization generally follows the passage of state laws, how do we conceptualize the kind of union strength in the state that may lead legislators to
enact such favorable statutes?

similar

to our cross—section

One method for assessing imilticollinearity is by assessing statistics in

the "variance decomposition matrix" and "condition indices" associated with

that matrix. These regression diagnostics were evaluated for the column
V4) specification for the 1978 equation. These diagnostics are developed
and described in David Beisley, Edwin Kithn, and Roy Welsch, Regression

Diagnostics: Identifying Influential Data and Sources of Collinearity,
(John Wiler and Sons: New York, 1980), pp. 85—191.

According

to this

discussion, the CONTRACT, LAW and PCT CONTRACT variables demonstrate a clear
case of "competing collinearity."

12. Ideally, we would have also liked to use the early period data to track
transitions into unionization for several years after paying relatively low

—33—

salaries. Unfortunately, the smaller samples for 1965 and 1973 contain

larger

cities (populations over 25,000) which according to our 1918 data

are relatively high—paying cities within their own states. Therefore, this
hazard function analysis is not performed with the data from the earlier
period.
