A Variance Bounds Test of the
Linear Quadratic Inventory Model

ABSTRACT

This paper develops and applies a novel test of the Holt, et al,

(1961) linear quadratic inventory model. It is shown that a central
property- of the model is that a certain weighted sum of variances and

covariances of production, sales and inventories must be nonnegative. The
weights are the basic structural parameters of the model. The model may be
tested by- seeing whether this sum

in

fact is nonnegative. When the test is

applied to some non—durables data aggregated to the two—digit SIC code
level, it almost always rejects the model, even though the model does well

by traditional criteria.

The linear quadratic inventory model, originated by Holt et al. (1961),
has been the basis of much theoretical and empirical work on manufacturers'

inventories of finished goods. The model argues that the basic reason firms
hold finished goods inventories is to smooth production in the face of
randomly fluctuating sales.

In some versions of the model a desire to avoid

sales backlogs provides an additional motive for holding inventories.1 That
firms might hold inventories for these reasons seems theoretically compelling
(Blinder (1983)), and much empirical work has been interpreted as being
supportive of the model (e.g., Blanchard (1983)).
Some basic facts about finished goods inventories, however, seem to

contradict the spirit if not the letter of this model. The model suggests
that firms will smooth production by building up inventory stocks when sales
are low and drawing down stocks when sales are high (Summers (1983)).
As is well known, however, manufacturers generally do precisely the opposite.
Stocks tend to be decuinulated in cyclical downturns and accumulated in cyclical

upturns (Blinder (l98la)). In addition, it has been suggested that the fact
that production has a larger variance than sales in many industries is
inconsistent with the model (Blanchard (1983), Blinder (198th)).

The

argument presumably is that firms could always make production exactly as
variable as sales by holding rio inventories. So if firms are holding

None of the authors cited

in the previous paragraph formally establish any implications of the production
smoothing model for variances and covariances of inventories, sales and

production. Still less do any try to quantify the economic or statistical
significance of the aspects of inventory behavior apparently inconsistent with

the production smoothing model. Whether these aspects provide no or considerable
evidence against the model therefore has not yet been established.
This paper formally establishes an inequality summarizing the implications

of the production smoothing model for the variances and covariances of inventories,
sales and production, and then uses some aggregate data to test the inequality

statistically. It turns out that the model is consistent both with accumulation
of inventories in cyclical upturns and with production being more variable

than sales, at least when a desire to avoid sales backlogs provides a motive for

holding inventories (Blanchard (1983)). But even the model that allows for such
a desire restricts the movements of inventories, sales and production, so that
only a certain amount of excess variability of production is consistent with

the model. The inequality that this paper derives summarizes these restrictions.
The inequality is derived by comparing how much better off the firm would
have expected to have been by ignoring random sales fluctuations and simply
letting inventories increase from period to period at their trend rate of growth.
This may be calculated as the difference between expected costs under this

static policy and the policy that is optimal according to the model. This
difference, which should be nonnegative if the model is correct, may be

expressed as a simple weighted sum of'certain variances and covariances of

inventories, sales and production. The weighted sum includes in particular the
excess of' production over sales variability. The weights are the basic structural
parameters of the model, obtainable in standard fashion from an Euler equation.
Even if all the estimates of parameters are right signed and significant, the
estimate of this difference in principle may be insignificantly positive, or even
negative.

If the difference is negative for a given set of data it seems unlikely that
inventories truly are chosen in accordance with the supposedly optimal policy and

therefore unlikely that the model is correct. The inequality quantifies the cost
savings produced by the optimal inventory policy——that is, it quantifies the
extent to which firms cut costs by adjusting inventories in response to random

sales fluctuations. If the model is correct, a violation of the inequality

indicates nonsensically that firms adjusted inventories to increase costs. Such
violation would therefore mean that there is no evidence that production smoothing
provided the motive for holding inventories.
And in fact, for almost all of the aggregate non—durables industries studied
here, the inequality is violated——that is, the allegedly optimal policy could for
almost all the industries have been expected to increase costs relative to the

static one. The increase is statistically significant about half the time.
Moreover, it is economically large, with expected deviations of costs from trend

that are up to 50 percent higher than under the static policy. This strongly
suggests that in these industries production smoothing does not provide the only
motive for holding inventories.
The conclusion that the model does not adequately explain the data considered
here seems particularly compelling since the test performed here requires

relatively few economic or statistical assumptions. The test, for example, is

—4—

consistent with but does not require ,the assumptions about market structure,

causality and demand made in the recent studies of Blanchard (1983) and Eichenbaum

(1982). Also, and again in contrast to Blanchard (1983) and Eichenbaum (1982),
it is computationally straightforward, requiring only linear estimatiQn. In fact,
in some cases, it could be concluded that the static inventory policy would be
expected to cost less than the supposedly optimal policy without even calculating

any of the model's parameters. All that was required was the calculation of
certain variances and covariances. Since the test easily extends to cover other
linear quadratic models, and perhaps some non—linear models as well, it may be
of general interest.

This is especially so since the test appears to be economically more
informative than the usual test of cross equation restrictions, at least in the

present case. The significance of a rejection or acceptance of the variance bounds
test can be measured not only in statistical but also in economic terms, by the

calculation of the increase in expected costs mentioned above. In addition, the
test itself suggests a reason for any rejection that occurs: some unexplained
factors are making production too volatile. This indicates that model needs to
be modified to account for such excess volatility, and the concluding section to

this paper briefly discusses some possible modifications. In contrast, statistical
rejections of tests of cross equation restrictions appear to be difficult to
interpret in economic terms (e.g., Blanchard (1983, p387)).

To prevent misunderstanding, it should be emphasized at the outset that the
innovation in the present paper is not in the model used but in the test performed.
Two general formulations of the model are studied, both drawn from the existing

literature on the linear quadratic inventory model. The two are motivated only
briefly and uncritically. A critical evaluation of the model may be found in

—5--

West (l983a) and Blinder (1983). The two were chosen because they are
representative of the many versions of the model that have been formulated.

Both are not only quite similar to most versions studied but are even identical to
or strictly more general than some (e.g., Holt at al. (1961), Beisley (1969)).

But the two of course do not incorporate all aspects of all formulations

of the model. It is worth mentioning in particular that both follow the
mainstream of work in the model and assume that inventories are held to cut
production and possibly backlog costs in the face of randomly fluctuating sales.

Some recent formulations of the model such as Blinder (1983) allow inventories
to also serve to cut production costs in the face of randomly varying production

costs. Extensions of the present paper to cover this and other major extensions
to the linear quadratic model are left for future work.

The paper is organized as follows. Part II develops the test, part III
contains empirical results, and part IV contains conclusions. An appendix
contains econometric details.

II. THE TEST
This section first describes the model arid then derives an inequality
that is central to the test.

A. The Model
The model under consideration is intended for finished goods inventories
in so—called "production to stock" industries (Abramowitz (1951), Rowley and

Trevedi (1975)). Its precise formulation varies from author to author, and
this paper's empirical work tests two versions. Both may be derived from the
following general model. Firms producing a single homogeneous good maximize
expected discounted real profits:

Two general comments on (1) will be made, before the individual terms

of the equation are briefly discussed. First, the firm's choice variables
have intentionally been left unspecified. The estimation here is consistent

with any of the standard ones: output only (Beisley (1969)) or inventories
only (Blanchard (1982)) in models in which sales are exogenous: output,
inventories and sales in models in which the firm is a perfect competitor
(Blanchard and Meljno (1981), Eichenbaum (1982)) -f-'; output, price and

inventories in models in which the firm is a monopolist (Blinder (1982)).
The firm's information set has been left unspecified for the same reason.
Second, for the present, all variables should be assumed to be deviations
from trend (where trend should be understood to encompass all deterministic

components, seasonal as well as secular). This assumption is made for
algebraic simplicity and will be relaxed shortly. What we wish to derive are
some restrictions that are implied for arbitrary trend, and the algebra is
less cluttered when trend terms are set to zero.
The first term in brackets in equation (1) is revenue, the second is

costs. Although the revenue function will play no role in the bulk of this
paper, it is worth pointing out some of the implications of its presence at
this initial state to emphasize the generality of the tests performed here.
The market may be perfect (Eichenbaum (1982))or imperfect (Blinder (1982)).
Price speculation on the supply side (Eichenbaum (1982)) or perhaps even on

the demand side may be present. Pricing and production decisions may be
made simultaneously (Eichenbaum (1982), Blinder (1982)) or separately (Holt,

et al., (1961)). In short, Summers' (1981) criticisms of inventory models that
ignore interactions between firms and their customers are not relevant here.

—8—

The second term in brackets is 'costs. These are the focus of the model,
and, here as elsewhere, are central. Total per period costs are the sum of
three terms.

The first is the cost of changing production, which is quadratic in the

period to period change in the number of units produced. This represents, for
example hiring and firing costs.

The second is the cost of production, which is quadratic in the number

of units produced. This approximates an arbitrary concave cost function
that results as usual from a decreasing returns to scale technology.
The third and final term embodies inventory and backlog costs, and is

quadratic in how far inventories are from a target level. A brief explanation
of its rationale is as follows (see West (1983a) for a lengthier discussion and
critique). Inventory holding costs (e.g., storage and handling charges), are

reflected in a2. The parameter a3 is the inventory to expected sales ratio that
would be set in the absence of both types of production costs (a0 =

=

a1

0).

all authors agree that this ratio should be anything but zero, and the two
major variations in (1) accommodated in the tests here turn on whether a3 is

allowed to be non—zero. Those who do so (Blanchard (1983), Eichenbaum (1982),
Holt, et al., (1961)) argue that sales sometimes exceed inventories on hand,

forcing firms to backlog orders. Firms face costs when such a backlog develops,

perhaps because of loss of future sales. Thus, ceteris paribus, when expected
sales are higher, inventories should be higher as well. The target level for

inventories, a3ES+1, trades off backlog and inventory costs. In this
model with a target level, inventories can serve two functions.-' They can

—9—

buffer production, allowing it to be smoothed in the presence of fluctuating

demand. And they can cut backlog costs. Optimal inventories balance production, holding arid backlog costs.

Some other authors, however, insist that in the absence of production
costs, the target level for inventories would be zero (Auerbach and Green

(1980), Belsley (1969), Blinder (1982)). They impose a3 = 0.

purely to smooth production. In this model without a target

optimal inventories balance savings in production costs against the

costs of carrying inventories.

The tests performed here will thus accommodate equation (1) both with
and without a target level for inventories.

B.

An Inequality
We now derive an inequality that compactly expresses the production

smoothing motive for holding inventories, by calculating the effect inventories

have on expected costs.—

circumstance under which the policy is not feasible is when production takes
place with a lag and inventories absorb sales expectatlonal errors, as in

considered approximately correct if those errors are small relative to the
size of the inventory stock, as seems reasonable.)

(Note that this alternative policy entails

varying inventories from period to period if inventories display a time trend

and/or seasonal variation.) For the remainder of the paper, (7.1) and
(7.2) wi.L! be understood to apply to Just such a model with deterministic
terms.

Lc should be noted again that for expositional convenience all such

terms will be referred to as "trend," even though the word "trend' is perhaps

somewhat misleading if deterministic seasonal fluctuations are present or if
secular growth is not.

In this light, let us interpret (7.1) and (7.2). The right—hand sides of
these two equations describe the cost savings that could be (unconditionally)

expected to result from setting inventories optimally rather than without

-13-

feedback. The first two terms express differences of production costs, the
third that of inventory costs, and the fourth, in (7.2), that of costs of

inventories that deviate from their target level. The expected difference

in inventory holding costs, .a2var(H), is always negative. Therefore,
according to the model, these expected cost increases are more than offset by
savings elsewhere (otherwise the optimal policy would not be optimal).
Inequality (7.l),.applicable when there is no target level, says that the

firm

must expect to save either on costs of changing production (var(Q) <

var(AS)),

or on costs of production (var(Q) <

var(S)),

or both, and the ex-

pected savings must be large enough that overall expected costs are lower,

i.e., (7.1) holds. Similarly, (7.2), applicable when there is a target
level, says that the optimal policy must be expected to more than offset
increases in expected inventory holding costs with expected savings in
production and/or target level costs.

Thus it would seem to be a minimal

economic requirement that (7.1) and

(7.2) be satisfied by data that are to be explained by the model. The
inequalities merely ask that the optimal policy be expected to cost less
than

the

static one. The static policy is the one that would be optimal in

the absence of any random fluctuations in sales. The inequalities therefore
summarize how production, sales and inventories are expected to interact as

they are dynamically adjusted in response to sales shocks. And this is precisely

what the model purports to explain. It is perhaps reasonable, therefore, to
ask that the data not only satisfy (7.1) and (7.2), but do so to an extent
that is significant in economic or statistical terms.

The next section sees how well some aggregate nondurables data satisfy

these inequalities. Given that (7.1) and (7.2) have been derived for a single

- 14—

firm,

however, it is appropriate t make a remark on aggregation before ex-

amining these empirical results. The inequalities do still hold at an aggregate
level, provided that all the parameters representing technology (e.g., the

a's) and the stochastic characteristics of forcing variables (i.e., their
ARNA parameters) are the same

for

each individual firm.

As is explained in

detail in West (1983a) under these sufficient though perhaps not necessary

nnditions each firm's

behavior

is summarized by a set of linear regressions

with identical coefficients on the regressors. As usual, therefore, the
model aggregates exactly, and aggregate behavior is characterized by the

same set of regressions. It is no surprise, then, that aggregate production,
sales and inventories satisfy (7.1) and (7.2), for arbitrary correlations of
production, sales and inventories across fir-ms.

LII.

Empirical

results

Data and estimation are described briefly before the basic and some
additional empirical results are presented.
A.

Data
The data were real (1972 dollars) and monthly. Both seasonally adjusted

and unadjusted data were used. Seasonally adjusted data were available for
1959 to 1980 for aggregate non—durables and for all six two—digit industries
that Belsley (1969) identified as operating in production to stock markets:
food (SIC 20), tobacco (SIC 21), apparel (SIC 23), chemicals (SIC 28), rubber

(SIC 30), and petroleum (SIC 29). Seasonally unadjusted data were available
for aggregate non—durables and three two digit industries (chemicals, petroleum,
and rubber).

(Again, durable goods and the remaining non—durable goods

industries were excluded because the model is intended to apply only to industries that produce to stock, and, according to Belsley (1969), none of these

-15-

other industries produce to stock.)
Sales were obtained by using the appropriate wholesale price index to

deflate the Bureau of the Census nominal figures for sales (all figures found
in the Citibank Economic Database, in the Bureau of the Census's (1978,1982)

Manufacturer's Shipments, Inventories and Orders or obtained directly from
the Bureau of the Census). The seasonally adjusted inventory figures were

obtained by converting the Bureau's receutly calculated constant dollar
seasonally-adjusted finished goods inventory series (Hinrichs and Eckman (1981))
from "cost" to "market" so that one dollar of inventories represented the same

physical units as one dollar of sales (see West (1983b) for a definition of
"cost" and "market" and an explanation of why a conversion was necessary). As in

Reagan and Sheehan (1982) the seasonally unadjusted constant dollar inventory
figures were obtained by multiplying the adjusted figures by the corresponding
unadjusted to adjusted ratio for book value (nominal) finished goods

inventories. (This procedure was adopted since no unadjusted constant dollar

data appear to be available. It makes the plausible assumption that the
"seasonal deflator" is the same for book value and constant dollar inventories.--")

Production was obtained from the identity Q

B. Estimation
The sample period covered 1959:5 to 1980:10, with 1980:11 and 1980:12

used for leads and 1959:2 to 1959:4 used for lags. All regressions included
deterministic terms: a constant and a time trend, and, for seasonally

unadjusted data, seasonal dummiesas well.-"
Three specific aspects of estimation will be briefly discussed. These
are estimation of the a, of the second moments of inventories, sales and

—16—

section. references to '(7)" should be understood to be shorthand for "(7.1)

(983a).
The a 's in the model with a target level were obtained as follows.

that 33=0 was imposed.) A necessary first order condition to solve (1)

The results here report d = .995 (corresponding annual discount rate is about six
per cent); results with d = .990 and d = .999 were virtually identical. The six
instruments used apart from the deterministic terms in (10) were three lags each t"t

-17-

inventories and sales. The estimation required two steps, as described in
[-iansen and Singleton (1982). The first step calculated the variance—covariance

matrix of the u1 and the second obtained the optimal instrumental variables

estimator. See the appendix and West (1983a) for further details. Since the
equation is overidentified ——

the model without a target level has four fewer

right—hand side variables than instruments, and that with has three —— Hansen!s
(1982) test of over—identifying restrictions was calculated.

Variances and covarjances were calculated from a bivariate (inventories,
sales) autoregression of order three:il"

The Yule—Walker equation using the estimated .. was then used in. the standard
way (Anderson (1971, p.

182)) to obtain the needed second monents of sales

and inventories. The second moments of production were derived
from

the

identity

e.g.

Q=St+H_H_j,

var(Q)=var(S)+2cov(S,H)—2cov(S,H1)+2var(H)—2cov(H,H1).
Finally, the standard error of the statistic (7) was derived as follows.
Let G be the parameter vector needed to calculate (7).

0 consists of the

coefficients on the right—hand side variables in the three equation system

consisting of (10) and (11) and the three elements of the covariance matrix
of the error terms in (11).

Thus, 0 is (1

data (24 = 15 RHS variables explicitly listed in (10) and (11) + 6 constant and

trend terms +3 elements of variarice—covariance matrix of the residuals in (11)).
Similarly,

asptoticallv noal with covariance matrix (dg/dO)V(dg/dO)'. The
standard error of (7) is the square root of (dg/dO)V(dg/d6)' .

The

derivatives dg/dO were calculated numerically.

It is to be noted that this procedure takes into account not only the
uncertainty in the estimates at the a. but also in the estimates of the

first and second moments. The procedure also accounts for the covariance
between the estimates of the a. and of moments. Again, for details see the

appendix and West (1983a).
C.

Results

We will shortly present estimates of the size and the standard errors of

the right hand sidesof (7.1) and (7.2) for the data described above. This
will require estimates not only of the appropriate variances and covariances
of inventories, sales and production, but of the a. parameters as well.

First, however, let us consider whether these data are qualitatively consistent

with the inequalities, by examining the appropriate second moments. Tables I
and II have these, for seasonally adjusted and unadjusted data respectively.
It follows inunediately from the trivial calculations underlying the

entries in Tables I and II that for both seasonally adjusted and unadjusted
data, the model without a target level violates (7.1) for almost all industries

(The only possible exception is chemicals.) Columns (5)—(7) indicate that

for all but the chemical industry, var(S)_var(Q)<O, and, of course,
var(H)>O. Since the a. are known a priori to be positive it follows that

for all but chemicals, O>a0(varXS)—var(Q)) + a1(var(S)—var(Q)) —

a2var(H).

In other words, according to the model itself, the static, no—feedback policy

of letting inventories grow at their trend rate would have ben expected to
be preferable to the optimal policy that the model claims actrually was followed:

—19—

lower costs of changing production, lower costs of production, and lower

inventory costs. From these simple calculations we can conclude that with
the possible exception of the chemical industry, the data studied here are

inconsistent with the model without a target level. This suggests that
backlog costs, whose existence is used to rationalize a non—zero target
level, are of crucial importance to this model.

It also follows from Tables I and II that even the model with a target

level is inconsistent with the seasonally unadjusted behavior of the petroleum
industry, since inventories here covary negatively with next period's sales.
Relative to the static policy, the optimal policy that supposedly was followed

would have been expected to increase all the costs just noted, and the cost

of being away from a target level as well. Thus, this data set is incompatible
with the model, with or without a target level. For the remaining industries,

(7.1) and (7.2) cannot be signed without the a.'s Let us therefore turn to
precise calculation of the inequalities.

In Tables III and IV are the a.'s for the models with and without a
1

target level, respectively. Almost all of the parameter estimates are indeed

positive. Consider the model without a target level first. With seasonally
adjusted data 11 of 14 free signs
the figure is 5 of 8.

on the a. are correct, and with unadjusted

(The number of free signs is 14 and 8 rather than 21

and 12 because the normalization rule a1+(l+d)a0=l constrains either

a0 or a1

to be positive in each equation.) The comparable figures for the model with
a target level are 19 of 21 and 9 of 12. Only two of the wrong—signed co—
efficients are significant at the .05 level (a0 in the model with a target
level, for both seasonally adjusted rubber and seasonally unadjusted aggregate

non—durabes). In most equations the production cost a1 and the cost of

—20—

changing production a0 are signifièant. Somewhat puzzling is the imprecision
of the estimates of the inventory holding cost a2 and the target level

parameter a3, which are rarely significant at the .05 level. They are,
however, almost always positive and stand here in about the same ratio to the
other a. and to each other as they did in Blanchard's (1983) estimates for
the automobile industry.

However, these parameters, though positive and often significant, are

not enough to make the model plausible. Results of the variance bounds test
for the model without a target level are shown in Table V, and for the model
with a target level in Table VI.

It was noted above what would result for all

data sets except possibly chemicals for the model without a target level, and
for the seasonally unadjusted petroleum industry in the model with a target

level. Thus it is no surprise that Tables V and VI indicate that (7.1) and
(7.2) were violated for all of these. However, the inequality for the model
without a target level was violated for seasonally unadjusted chemicals as well,
as was the inequality for the model with a target level for most of the data

sets. Thus, the inequalities were violated in seventeen out of twenty—two
instances, and nine of these were significant at the .05 level. The four
data sets that did satisfy (7.2) did so insignificantly, with standard errors

uniformly larger than the sizes of the inequality. Also, two of these four
produced the only significantly wrong—signed parameter (a0 for adjusted rubber

and unadjusted aggregate non—durables). It therefore appears that the model
does not well explain any of the data studied here.

Moreover, the increase in deviations of Costs from trend attributable
to the optimal policy would appear to be economically as well as statistically

noticeable. Column (2)

in

Tables V and VI contain total deviations of costs

—21—

from trend (again, in 'normalized" dbllars, a1+(1+d)a0=1):

(12)

(1—d) [a0var(Q)+a1var(Q)+a2var(H)
—

2a2a3cov(H,S1)+a2a3var(S)]

When (7.1) or (7.2) is divided by (12) (possibly with a3=0 imposed in (12))
the result is a dimensionless measure of the extent to which, the optimal

policy increases or decreases deviations of costs from trend relative to the

static policy. This is shown in column 3 of Tables V and VI. The optimal
policy increases expected cost deviations by up to 56 percent.

If this increase

were to be believed it would mean that deviations of profit margins from
trend, and therefore presumably profit margins themselves, are substantially
reduced.

It is of some interest to compare the results of the inequality tests
with those of a common test of specification, the Hansen (1982) test of over—
identifying restrictions that is reported in the columns labelled J.

This

was accepted at the .05 level for about two thirds of the data sets (food,
tobacco, apparel, petroleum, rubber) and was rejected at the .05 but accepted

at the .005 level for the two other data sets. This compares favorably
with the tests of the overidentifying restrictions in other recent studies

(Blanchard (1983), Ejchenbaum (1982)). Thus it is perhaps fair to say that
this traditional test is supportive of the model. It would appear, then,
that the variance bounds test was an essential element in assessing the
reasonableness of this model for these data.

Additional empirical results

The robustness of the conclusions of the previous subsection was checked

by calculating two additional sets of estimates. The first related to some

applies to a model without a target level, (13.2) to a model with

a target level. Loequality (13.1) in conjunction with inequality

(7.1) says

that when firms allow deterministic inventory seasonals to depart from their

-23-

mean level, this must not increase'costs to such an extent that the cost

savings detailed in (7.1) are more than offset. Further, these departures
will cut costs only insofar as they make var(QS) and var(2QS), the deterministic
seasonal costs of production and changing production, smaller than var (SS)
and var(ISS), the deterministic seasonal cost that obtains when there are no

departures of inventory seasonals from their mean levels. Inequality (13.2)
in conjunction with inequality(7.2) has a comparable interpretation.
It is of interest, then, to calculate the relevant "variances' and
"covariances," as well as to estimate the size and standard errors of (13.1)

and (13.2). The relevant second moments for the fou-r seasonally unadjusted

data sets are displayed in Table VII. For two of the four data sets (aggregate
non—durables and rubber), it can be concluded without calculating any parameter
estimates that (13.1) will be rejected.

(This follows since columns (5) and

(6) are negative for these two data sets in both Table VII and Table II.)
For the other two data sets, parameters do have to be estimated to sign (13.1),
and, for all four data sets, parameter estimates are needed to sign (13.2).

The model, then, seems to be qualitatively consistent with (13.1) to a slightly
greater degree than with (7.1), in that two data sets rather than one have
second moments that are consistent with one relevant inequality.
En a more formal, quantitative sense, however, the model performs as
poorly with respect to (13.1) and (13.2) as it did with respect to (7.1) and
121

(7.2).-—

Once again, almost all the inequalities are wrong signed, about

half of them significantly so (see Tables VIII and Ix).

The only exception,

once again, is chemicals (which does, however, satisfy (13.1) and (13.2)
in a statistically significan.t fashion).

—24—

For these data, as for the automobile data studied by Blanchard (1983),
then, the seasonals appear to contain little evidence to suggest that
manufacturers are selecting their inventories in accord with (1).

(II) Inequalities (7:1) and (7.2) were also tried for quarterly, seasonally

adjusted data. These were constructed from the monthly data sales by adding
the figures for the relevant three months, inventories by selecting the last

rf th ,iirl-r

mrinrh —-

Since the estimates were very

similar

to those for monthly data, only a

summary of the final results seems worth reporting. Inequality (7.1) was wrong
signed for six of seven data sets (the exception was tobacco, and resulted

from wrong—signed estimates of a0 and a2). Inequality (7.2) was wrong signed
for all seven data sets. Four of the fourteen wrong signs were significant
at the 5 percent level; the correct sign for tobacco was not.

These additional tests, then, support the results reported in the previous

subsection.-'

IV.

CONCLUSIONS

This summarizes the basic conclusions of this paper. It would seem that
the linear quadratic model does a poor job of rationalizing these inventory

data. In effect, a contradiction results when it is assumed that the actual
inventory path chosen is the one that is optimal according to the model. The
allegedly optimal path is dominated by a naive alternative path.
En the model without a target level, for inventories, this follows simply

because production is more variable than sales. Inventories therefore cannot

be chosen simply to perform their putative function, smoothing production.!
For the model with a target level, the matter is slightly more complicated.
Inventories do usually track their target level (except in the petroleum

-25-

industry) .

But this makes production and inventories so variable that inven—

tories cannot be chosen as hypothesized, to minimize quadratic inventory,
production and target-level costs.

The basic implication of this is that inventories appear to serve some

role other than production smoothing. The inventory literature suggests
two possible explanations of the excess volatility of production. The first

is backlog coss. Now, as we have seen, the typical formulation —— a simple
cost of having inventories deviate from a target level

is inadequate, at

least for these data. But this does not rule out more sophisticated formularion.
Some encouraging evidence from a model that includes such a formulation may be

found in 1est (1983a).
The second possible explanation relates to stochastic cost variability. It
is possible that inventories serve mainly not to smooth production in the face
of random varying demand, but to smooth it in the face of randomly varying costs.
In this case production may be more variable than sales (as noted by Topel

(1982)). Stochastic cost variability has been crudely allowed for in some recent
work by calling the unobservable disturbances "cost shocks" (Blarichard (1983)

Eichenbaum (l92)). But if cost variability is an important determinant of
optimal inventory stocks, it clearly is essential to model the cost variations

explicitly. Some encouraging evidence from a model that does such modelling
may be found in Blinder (1983).
It seems fair to say, however, that a convincing explanation of the
excess volatility of production has yet to be made (see Blinder (1983)).

FOOTNOTES

1.

Throughout this paper, the word "inventories" used without qualification

refers to manufacturers' inventories of finished goods.

2. Lictienbawn's (1982) model does riot fit precisely into this framework,

even in its simplified version (1982, pp 24—25). He includes the term
is the wage and a4 another

in the cost function, where

positive parameter. As will, become apparent, the inequality to be
derived here is approximately correct if a4(cov(w,Q)'-cov(w,S)) is small
compared to the other terms in the inequality.

3. That

is,

inventories

serve two functions apart from any they may

serve on the revenue side. In the

general

formulation of the model used

here, inventories may alsoaserve to, say, allow the price speculation by
producers that is emphasized in Eichenbaum (1982). The cosssent in this
footnote also applies the model without a target level.

4. I thank both R. Shiller and L. Suers for (independently) suggesting
to me the basic argument of this section.

5. Except if the

firm

has some market power and demand depends on actual

or expected production or inventories. As far as I know, this assumption
has never been made in this class of models.
6. See Bertsekas (1976, pp. 191—2) for a definition of an "open loop" policy.

Strictly

A *
speaking, setting HtHt is the open loop policy only if inventories

are the only control.

7.

An alternative method for calculating unadjusted constant dollar

inventories would be to deflate book value inventories by the appropriate
wholesale price inde.?c. Given the massive switch from FIFO to LIFO

accounting in the 1970's and Cyclical differences in output price versus
input cost (see Foss, et al. (n.d.fl, this is likely to lead to

estimates

substantially inferior than those derived as described in the text.

F2—

8.

It should be noted that in Reagan and Sheehan (1982) time series study of

precisely the unadjusted aggregate data used here, it was found that seasonal
dummies alone successfully accounted for the seasonal variation in inventories.
There appeared to be no need to allow for indeterministic seasonal components.

9.

This assumes dp .S+./dH=O. This is consistent with any linear

quadratic inventory model that I am aware of, including not only those in
which sales are exogenous (e.g. Belsley (1969)) but also those in which
they are jointly endogenous with inventories (Eichenbaum (1982), Blinder
(1982)).

10. uit

is MA(l)

if

production and sales decisions are made simultaneously.

But if production is decided before sales are known, as in Blinder (1982),
u

it

is MA(2).

It

seemed desirable to adopt

a procedure

that was consistent

under those circumstances, so the estimation procedure allowed for a MA(2)

disturbance.
This is not to say that the model (1) implies that inventories and
sales follow such an autoregression. In general, however, it does imply

11.

that they follow a bivariate ARMA process of some order (Hansen and
Sargent (1981)). The order cf the ARMA process can.not be tied down
without making auxiliary assumptions that we have been at pains to avoid

making. The AR process assumed in the text should be considered an
approximation to this ARMA process.

13. One further set of estimates was obtained, but results were so poor
that they do not appear to warrant reporting in the text. An independent
measure of production was obtained by using the Federal Reserve Board's

index of industrial production. This is an available seasonally
adjusted, and (7.1) and (7.2) were estimated for five of the seasonally
adjusted data sets (aggregate non—durables, chemicals, food, petroleum
and rubber). (Naturally, the inventory and sales figures were also
scaled• down to a base of 1967=100.) Parameter estimates, unfortunately
were uniformly nonsensical, with about three—fourths of them wrong

signed. The tests of (7.1) and (7.2) therefore do not seem worth

reporting. But it is perhaps worth noting that var Q<var S for all
five data sets.

Apparently, the FRB index of industrial production does not jibe
with the Department of Commerce figures on sales and inventories. Alan
Blinder has suggested to me that this is because the FRB measure includes
production that adds value to works in progress inventories.

14. This has been conjectured by Blinder (1981b) and Blanchard (1983)

Appendix
The appendix briefly outlines the procedure usc1

to

derive the

asymptotic covariance matrix of the parameters needed to calculate (7.1)

and (7.2). Much more detail may be found in West (1983a).
Write the three equation system consisting of (10) and (11) as:

y1 =

Xb

+

= Zb +

u2

y3Zb3+u3
y1 is the vector of observations of the left hand side of (10); y2 and y3
contain vectors of inventories and

sales.

X contains the right hand side

variables in (10) (including deterministic terms), Z the right hand side

variables in (11). The error U1

jfl

MA(2) (see footnote 10), u2 and u3 are lid.

b1 was estimated by two step, two stage least squares,

b1=(AZ'X)1AZ'y1.

A is Hansen's (1982) optimal weighting matrix (no

heteroscedasticity correction), A=X' Z(Z '2Z). ,

the variance—covariance

matrix of u1, was calculated from 2SLS estimates of u1.
The numerical simulations in West (1984) suggest that

is likely to be

estimated only slightly less efficiently than it would have been had it been
estimated by a "full information" technique that specified the demand side of
the market, solved for the equilibrium of the model, and imposed crass—equation
contraints.

b2 and b3 were estimated by OLS.

-A2-

Let 0 denote the parameter vector, S =

(b1,b2, b3,a22,a23,33).

and are needed to calculate (7.1) and (7.2) since they figure

into th variances and covariances in these inequalities. (These second
moments, again, were calculated as functions of b7,b3 and the a. as
described briefly in the text and in detail in West (1983a).) Now, the.

b. were calculated as just described, the a.. from the moments of the OLS
