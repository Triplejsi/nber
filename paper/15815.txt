This Time is Different Chartbook: Country Histories on Debt, Default, and Financial Crises
Carmen M. Reinhart
NBER Working Paper No. 15815
March 2010
JEL No. F3,H6,N50
ABSTRACT
This Chartbook provides a pictorial history, on a country-by-country basis, of public debt and economic
crises of various forms. It is a timeline of a country’s creditworthiness and financial turmoil. The analysis,
narrative, and illustrations in Reinhart and Rogoff (2009), This Time is Different: Eight Centuries
of Financial Folly, were primarily organized around themes (serial default, inflation, etc.), although
detailed tables in the book chronicled country-specific information on the dating, frequency, incidence,
etc. of specific crises episodes by country. The Chartbook compliments the thematic analysis with
individual country histories, and provides the grounds for a systematic analysis of the temporal patterns
of debt cycles, banking and sovereign debt crises, hyperinflation, and, for the post World War II period,
the reliance on IMF programs.

Chartbook 2010

I. Preamble
This Chartbook provides a pictorial history, on a country-by-country basis, of debt and
economic crises of various forms. The analysis, narrative, and illustrations in This Time is
Different, were primarily organized around themes (serial default, inflation, etc.), although
detailed tables in the book chronicled country-specific information on the dating, frequency,
incidence, etc. of specific crises episodes by country. 1 The Chartbook compliments the thematic
analysis—indeed, it fills in as documentation to its underpinnings. What follows systematically
illustrates for 70 countries the individual timeline of public and private debts, banking, sovereign
domestic and external debt crises, and hyperinflation, starting from a country’s independence
(and even prior to that in numerous cases) to the present. The dating of the largest output
declines and a country’s history with International Monetary Fund (IMF) programs since World
War II to deal with an assortment of economic ills contribute to the chronologies.
The individual country histories are often fascinating in their own right, highlighting that
virtually no country has escaped unscathed from economic crises of one form or another. In
effect, in a number of countries, financial crises are more “a way of life” affecting all, if not most
generations. Black swans are not that rare.
The prologue to this Chartbook is minimalist by design and is organized as follows. The
next section offers an essential guide to the country charts and the accompanying tables, clarifies
methodological issues, and delineates the approach followed to document the vast number of
sources referenced in this analysis.
Section III summarizes some of the main (common or recurrent) themes and patterns that
(collectively) the country histories reveal. Some of these are documented in the literature while
others merit considerable further study. These “big picture” themes include: The repeated-game
nature of sovereign debt crises and the fact serial default is commonplace among today’s

emerging markets just as it was among advanced economies in an earlier era needs little
commentary, as even a causal perusal of the charts display this historical pattern. The serial
nature of banking crises (particularly among the more developed economies prior to World War
II) is equally compelling. Nearly all of the 21 advanced economies in the sample record an
impressive crisis tally, especially from the 1880s to the 1930s. The episodes where there are
surges in private debt before the crisis and public debts after the crisis are not only numerous but
span across advanced and emerging economies in nearly all regions. And so on…
The last section discusses where there are gaps in the data and overall analysis of the
debt-crisis cycle. As such, it is a roadmap for future research,

II. Key to Charts and Methodology Notes
For working definitions of banking, currency, debt, and inflation crises, see the extensive
discussion in Reinhart and Rogoff (2009a and 2010). As to the crises highlighted in the country
profiles, our focus is on primarily external sovereign default (also its less common counterpart-domestic sovereign default) and banking crises. Many countries have a rich history of recurring
(and often chronic) exchange rate crashes and inflation crises, particularly (but not exclusively) in
post World War II Latin America. We only provide limited information on these recurring follies
in monetary history.2 We do include, highlight and date all hyperinflation episodes, as these have
been associated with the complete or near complete liquidation (through de facto default) of
domestic currency debts.
Key to charts
Besides the events discussed above, in a few charts we highlight “near- default” episodes,
which involve some form of international assistance to avoid a default or a restructuring. Their
dates are also listed in the first column of the accompanying table. Some examples of sub2

In the tables that accompany each country profile, we do provide, as summary statistic on inflation crises,
the share of years with annual inflation above 20 per cent per annum. This inflation performance also gives
a reasonable indication of the incidence of currency crashes,

7

C.M. Reinhart
Chartbook 2010

sovereign defaults (by states or provinces) are also flagged. In a few charts, historic currency
crashes (such as the collapse of an 80-year old peg) are highlighted as well. More mundane
episodes of inflation and currency crises are not shown. However, the full sample incidence
(share of years) in an inflation crisis, is reported in the table below the chart, so as to provide
information on chronic inflation problems. 3 The major output collapses shown in the tables that
accompany the charts and the numerous IMF progams since 1952 (listed as a memorandum item
at the bottom of the table) are not depicted in the figures, to avoid compromising clarity.

Insets of smaller tables and charts into the figures
Insets are used throughout to provide complementary information to that shown in the
main figure. For example, for many advanced economies, an inset plots for household credit to
GDP from the mid-1990s to the present to highlight trends in private debts ahead of the 20072008 crisis. In other cases, these insets provide information on the maturity composition of the
debt (public or private, as the case may be) on the eve of a banking crisis be it default or
hyperinflation. The distribution of public and private debt before and after a crisis also provide
documentation of the numerous crisis cases where the government assumed important quantities
of private debts.

and Rogoff (2010).

Descriptive statistics in the tables to each country
Descriptive statistics are mostly self-explanatory, but two particulars merit explanation.
The first year of banking crises are listed and those shown in italics indicate that the episode in
question was not deemed to be a systemic crisis. Near default episodes are also shown in italics
and not counted in the tally of default. The last column provides information on the largest annual
output declines, usually the top five, but more or less when relevant. Both the year and the
percent decline (in parentheses) are given. For full output collapse episodes, the interested reader
is referred to Barro and Ursua (2009).
The bottom portion of the table gives memorandum items on IMF programs with the
country over the period from 1952 to 2009. The first year of the program is listed as well as the
total number of programs. The relevant sources are discussed below.
Debt ratios
Debt is usually shown as a percent of GDP and in a few cases as a percent of exports. In a
handful of cases we have debt data for the earlier part of the 19th century but no GDP or trade
measure to scale the debt data by. In those few cases, we show changes in debt (often over three
years) to provide an indication of the debt cycle. The nominal GDP data comes from numerous
scholars as well as official statistical sources. For a number of developing countries we have
more data on exports than for GDP (in all cases we have post World War II nominal GDP data).
In these cases the charts show the actual debt/GDP ratio for the period during which GDP data is
available (say post 1920s) and use the debt/exports ratio times the average export to GDP ratio
(for the period during which both series overlap) to back-cast the series.
References and sources
Most charts list the main source as Reinhart and Rogoff (2009), which has an extensive data
appendices listing sources series-by-series and country-by-country over different subperiods.
Additional sources listed below each graph usually indicate that we came across these sources
subsequent to the publication. Prominent examples of the recent discoveries include: detailed

9

C.M. Reinhart
Chartbook 2010

recent historical studies of Italian, Greek, Dutch and Swedish public debts (Maura Francese and
Angelo Page for Italy, Sophia Lazaretou on Greek 19th century domestic debts, Frit Bos for the
Netherlands, and Klas Fregert and Roger Gustafsson for Sweden.) As the sample was extended
to include Bulgaria, Ghana, Iceland, Ireland, and Switzerland, pertinent sources for these are also
listed in the relevant country page. Finally, the sources for the IMF programs are Bird, Hussain
and Joyce (2004), Mody and Saravia (2009), and the IMF’s Annual Reports for several years to
update these studies through 2009.

III. Debt and Crises: Main Themes
This section highlights some of the issues where the collective evidence from the country
histories are particularly illuminating. Throughout, I use country examples or specific crises
episodes to illustrate particular points.
(i) Serial default is a widespread phenomenon across emerging markets and several
advanced economies. Figures 8a and 26 for Brazil and Greece, respectively (among many more
that are similar) call attention to this point by simply shading the years in default throughout the
sample; the summary table also lists the timing and duration of each default spell while the tally
entry (bottom of column 1) reports the default tally for 1800-2009. Countries such as France and
pain have a higher count if pre-1800 default episodes are counted.
(ii) Prior to World War II, serial banking crises in the advanced economies was the
norm; as the larger emerging markets developed a financial sector in the late 1800s—these
economies joined the “serial banking” crisis club. Country histories for Belgium (Figure 6),
Canada (Figure 10a) among others, illustrate this pattern. The world financial centers (the UK,
Figure 65a and the US Figure 66a) take the lead in serial banking crises. One can speculate that
the less-developed economies substitute foreign bankers for nonexistent domestic ones. As such,
when acute sovereign fiscal difficulties arise, these become manifest in serial external default
rather than serial domestic banking crises.

10

C.M. Reinhart
Chartbook 2010

(iii) In light of serial debt and banking crises (not to mention chronic currency and price
instability), it is not surprising to see a similar serial pattern in the incidence of IMF programs.
Peru and the Philippines set the record with 24 and 23 programs, respectively. However, IMF
programs were not always in the exclusive domain of emerging markets. During the 1950s1970s, the IMF was more like the discount window of a central bank and did not carry the stigma
it of the default or near default cases. Among the advanced economies, the U.K. holds the record
with 11 programs.4
(iv) Private debts typically surge prior to a banking crises. This pattern is evident in
total external debt (a stock), capital inflow bonanzas (a flow), domestic banking sector credit (a
stock), or any combination of these. 5 Public debts may or may not surge ahead of banking
crises. Indeed, especially in financial repression cases the governments efforts to stuff its debts in
“captive “ bank balance sheets Procyclical fiscal policies, where the government amplifies the
boom-bust cycle in total debt (as documented in Kaminsky, Reinhart and Vegh, 2003), all too
often re-enforce the boom in private indebtedness ahead of the banking crisis.
For external debts, see Figures 30b and 62a for Iceland and Thailand, respectively.
Surges in capital inflows do not last forever. When they end, countries often display the Calvotype sudden stop syndrome, even in crises of an earlier century in advanced economies. 6 The
U.S. experience during 1865-1913, shown in Figure 68b, exemplifies this behavior. Domestic
credit climbs sharply prior to the banking crisis an unwinds afterward—the examples form
banking in Colombia (Figure 12b) and Norway (Figure 47b) demonstrate this time profile. By
contrast, the famous (or infamous) lost decade and bank debt overhang in post 1992 crisis Japan
is evident from Figure 34b. The coverage on domestic credit boom in this Chartbook is not
intended to be as comprehensive as public and external debt—the primary focus. However, the

4

Bird et.al. (2004) aptly title their paper on IMF programs “Many Happy Returns?..”
The term “capital flow bonanza” is introduced in Reinhart and Reinhart(2008) and refers to a surge in
capital inflows (over and beyond their historoic norm).

5

11

C.M. Reinhart
Chartbook 2010

pattern alluded to here is strongly supported by the evidence from studies that have focused
primarily on the domestic credit cycle. The most comprehensive in terms of country coverage is
Mendoza and Terrones (2008), who find most booms are followed by currency crises, banking
crises or both. The smaller country set for the 1880-2008 period studied in Schularick and Taylor
(2010) presents similar findings.7
(v) Banking crises most often either precede or coincide with sovereign debt crises. To
be clear, we are referring to “domestic” banking crises, the issue of whether banking crises in the
financial centers precede domestic banking crises and or sovereign defaults or restructurings is
examined in some detail in Reinhart and Rogoff (2010). The reasons for this temporal sequence
may be the contingent liability story emphasized by Diaz Alejandro (1985) and formalized in
Velasco (1986), in which the government takes on massive debts from the private banks, thus
undermining its solvency.8 Even absent large scale bailouts (and without counting the post-crisis
new government guarantees) , Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) establish that, largely owing to
collapsing revenues, government debts typically rise by about 86 percent in the three years
following a systemic financial crisis, this sets the stage for rating downgrades and, in the worst
scenario, default.
The list of country examples of this sequencing is too long to enumerate, we would
highlight as illustrative, the Barings 1891 crisis in Argentina (Figure 3b), Austria’s banking crisis
in 1931 and subsequent default in 1932 (Figure 5a) and Indonesia’s 1997-1998 banking crisis and
1999-2000 default (Figure 32a).
(vi) Public debts follow a repeated boom-bust cycle; many (if not most) of the bust
phase involved a debt crisis in emerging markets. Public sector borrowing surges as the crisis
nears. Debts continue to rise after default, as arrears accumulate and GDP contracts markedly.9

7

Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) and Gourinchas et.al. (2001) also document for different samples this
boom-crisis-bust pattern.
8
See Arellano and Kocherlakota (2008) for a framework that is consistent with these dynamics.
9
See Reinhart and Rogoff (2008) on evidence on output behavior before during and after debt crises.

C.M. Reinhart
Chartbook 2010

If there is an exchange rate crash associated with default, as shown in Reinhart (2002), the
valuation effect on external debts also contributes to further increase in debt/GDP ratios.
The boom-bust episodes are very numerous cutting across regions and time. The crisis
episode in Figure 69 for Zambia illustrates the pre-crisis surge in public debt—as well as its
continued climb in the early stage of default.
(vii) As suggested in the Diamond and Dybvig’s famous framework of banking crises, shortterm debts (public and private) escalate on the eve of banking crisis and sovereign defaults. 10
This pattern is also consistent with He and Xiong’s (2010) setting, where creditors' incentives to
shorten debt maturity to protect themselves against runs by other creditors. Most famously,
Mexico ramped up its short-term debt issuance just in advance of its “Tesobonos” crisis in 1994
as in Figure 40b. In the march toward hyperinflation, long-term debts disappear altogether; the
German hyperinflation of 1923-1924 (Figure 22a) demonstrates these dynamics.
(viii) Private debts become public debts-after the crisis. Several examples from the debt
crisis that engulfed Latin America in the early 1980s and lasted a decade are documented in
various insets that document the rising share of private “hidden debts” carrying implicit
government guarantees (Figure 62a for Thailand, among others) (Figure 19a for Ecuador, for
example). 11

See Chang and Velasco (2000) for an open-economy treatment of Diamond and Dibvig (1983).

Notes: For the period 1973-1989 the data is for external public debt for general government, this
underestimates public indebtedness, as it does not include domestic (or internal) debts—at the same time
general government is more inclusive than our central government measure. These two effects are working
in opposite directions.

Notes: Prices are far more volatile during pre-World War II. For this reason, and owing to the fact that
deflation is about as likely as inflation prior to the rise of fiat money, we also examine the evolution of
(smoother) three year changes in the price level.
