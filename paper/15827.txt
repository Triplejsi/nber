ABSTRACT
This chapter seeks to set out what Economists have learned about the effects of early childhood influences
on later life outcomes, and about ameliorating the effects of negative influences. We begin with a brief
overview of the theory which illustrates that evidence of a causal relationship between a shock in early
childhood and a future outcome says little about whether the relationship in question biological or
immutable. We then survey recent work which shows that events before five years old can have large
long term impacts on adult outcomes. Child and family characteristics measured at school entry do
as much to explain future outcomes as factors that labor economists have more traditionally focused
on, such as years of education. Yet while children can be permanently damaged at this age, an important
message is that the damage can often be remediated. We provide a brief overview of evidence regarding
the effectiveness of different types of policies to provide remediation. We conclude with a list of some
of (the many) outstanding questions for future research.

Introduction

The last decade has seen a blossoming of research on the long term effects of early
childhood conditions across a range of disciplines. In economics, the focus is on how human capital accumulation responds to the early childhood environment. In 2000, there
were no articles on this topic in the Journal of Political Economy, Quarterly Journal of
Economics, or the American Economic Review (excluding the Papers and Proceedings),
but there have been five or six per year in these journals since 2005. This work has
been spurred by a growing realization that early life conditions can have persistent and
profound impacts on later life. Table 1 summarizes several longitudinal studies which
suggest that characteristics that are measured as of age 7 can explain a great deal of the
variation in educational attainment, earnings as of the early 30s, and the probability of
employment. For example, McLeod and Kaiser [2004] use data from the National Longitudinal Surveys and find that children’s test scores and background variables measured
as of ages 6 to 8 predict about 12% of the variation in the probability of high school
completion and about 11% of the variation in the probability of college completion.
Currie and Thomas [1999a] use data from the 1958 British Birth Cohort study and find
that 4 to 5% of the variation in employment at age 33 can be predicted, and as much
as 20% of the variation in wages. Cunha and Heckman [2008] and Cunha, Heckman,
and Schennach [forthcoming] estimate structural models in which initial endowments
and investments feed through to later outcomes; they arrive at estimates that are of a
similar order of magnitude for education and wages. To put these results in context,
labor economists generally feel that they are doing well if they can explain 30% of the
variation in wages in a human capital earnings function.
This chapter seeks to set out what economists have learned about the importance
of early childhood influences on later life outcomes, and about ameliorating the effects
of negative influences. We begin with a brief overview of the theory which illustrates
that evidence of a causal relationship between a shock in early childhood and a future
outcome says little about whether the relationship in question biological or immutable.
Parental and social responses are likely to be extremely important in either magnifying
or mitigating the effects of a shock. Given that this is the case, it can sometimes be
difficult to interpret the wealth of empirical evidence that is accumulating in terms of
an underlying structural framework.
The theoretical framework is laid out in Section 3 and followed by a brief discussion
of methods in Section 4. We do not attempt to cover issues such as identification and
instrumental variables methods which are covered in some depth elsewhere (cf Angrist
and Pischke [2009]). Instead, we focus on several issues that come up frequently in the
2

early influences literature, including estimation using small samples and the potentially
high return to better data.
The fifth section of the paper discusses the evidence for long term effects of early
life influences in greater detail, while the sixth focuses on the evidence regarding remediation programs.

The discussion of early life influences is divided into two sections

corresponding to in utero influences and after birth influences. The discussion of remediation programs starts from the most general sort of program, income transfers, and
goes on to discuss interventions that are increasingly targeted at specific domains. In
surveying the evidence we have attempted to focus on recent papers, and especially
those that propose a plausible strategy for identifying causal effects. We have focused
on papers that emphasize early childhood, but in instances in which only evidence regarding effects on older children is available, we have sometimes strayed from this rule.
A summary of most of the papers discussed in these sections is presented in Tables 4
through 13. A list of acronyms used in the tables appears in Appendix A. We conclude
with a summary and a discussion of outstanding questions for future research in Section
7.

Conceptual Framework

Grossman [1972] models health as a stock variable that varies over time in response to
investments and depreciation. Because some positive portion of the previous period’s
health stock vanishes in each period (e.g., age in years), the effect of the health stock and
health investments further removed in time from the current period tends to fade out.
As individuals age, the early childhood health stock and the prior health investments
that it embodies become progressively less important.
In contrast, the “early influences” literature asks whether health and investments
in early childhood have sustained effects on adult outcomes. The magnitude of these
effects may persist or even increase as individuals age because childhood development
occurs in distinct stages that are more or less influential of adult outcomes.
Defining h as health or human capital at the completion of childhood, we can retain
the linearity of h in investments and the prior health stock as in Grossman [1972], but
leave open whether there is indeed “fade out” (i.e. depreciation). For simplicity, we will
consider a simple two-period childhood.1 We can consider production of h:
h = A[γI1 + (1 − γ)I2 ],
1

See Zweifel, Breyer, and Kifmann [2009] for a two period version of the Grossman [1972] model.

where:

(

I1 ∼
= investments during childhood through age 5
I2 ∼
= investments during childhood after age 5.

For a given level of total investments I1 + I2 , the allocation of investments between
period 1 and 2 will also affect h for γ 6= .5. If γ > .5, then health at the end of period
1 is more important to h than investments in the second period, and if γA > 1, h may
respond more than one-for-one with I1 . Thus, (1) admits the possibility that certain
childhood periods may exert a disproportionate effect on adult outcomes that does not
necessarily decline monotonically with age. This functional form says more than “early
life” matters; it suggests that early-childhood events may be more influential than later
childhood events.

2.1

Complementarity

The assumption that inputs at different stages of childhood have linear effects is common
in economics. While it opens the door to “early origins”, perfect substitutability between
first and second period investments in (1) is a strong assumption. The absence of
complementarity implies that all investments should be concentrated in one period (up
to a discount factor) and no investments should be made during the low-return period.
In addition, with basic preference assumptions, perfect substitutability “hard-wires” the
optimal investment response to early-life shocks to be compensatory, as seen in Section
2.3.
As suggested by Heckman [2007], a more flexible “developmental” technology is the
constant elasticity of substitution (CES) function:
h
i1/φ
φ
φ
h = A γI1 + (1 − γ)I2
,

(2)

For a given total investment level I1 + I2 , how the allocation between period 1 and
2 will also affect h depends on the elasticity of substitution,1/(1 − φ),and the share
parameter,γ. For φ = 1 (perfect substitutability of investments), (2) reduces to (1).
Heckman [2007] highlights two features of “capacity formation” beyond those captured in (2). First, there may be “dynamic complementarities” which imply that investments in period t are more productive when there is a high level of capability in
period t − 1. For example, if the factor productivity term A in (2) were an increasing
function of h0 , the health endowment immediately prior to period 1, this would raise
the return to investments during childhood. Second, there may be “self-productivity”
which implies that higher levels of capacity in one period create higher levels of capacity
4

in future periods. This feature is especially noteworthy when h is multidimensional, as
it would imply that “cross-effects” are positive, e.g. health in period 1 leads to higher
cognitive ability in period 2. “Self-productivity” is more trivial in the unidimensional
case like Grossman [1972] – even though the effect of earlier health stocks tends to fade
out as the time passes, there is still memory as long as depreciation in each period is
less than total (i.e., when δ < 1 in Zweifel, Breyer, and Kifmann [2009]).
Here, we will use the basic framework in (2) to consider the effect of exogenous shocks
µg to health investments that occur during the first childhood period.2 We begin with
the simplest case, where investments do not respond to µg (and denote these investments
I¯1 and I¯2 ). Net investments in the first period are:
I¯1 + µg .
We assume that µg is independent of I¯1 . While µg can be positive or negative, we
assume I¯1 + µg > 0. We will then relax the assumption of fixed investments, and
consider endogenous responses to investments in the second period, i.e. δI2∗ /δµg , and
how this investment response may mediate the observed effect on h.

2.2

Fixed Investments

Conceptually, we can trace out the effect of µg while holding other inputs fixed, i.e., we
assume no investment response to this shock in either period. Albeit implicitly, most
biomedical and epidemiological studies in the “early origins” literature aim to inform us
about this ceteris paribus, “biological” relationship.
In this two-period CES production function adopted from Heckman [2007], the impact of an early-life shock on adult outcomes is:
h
i(1−φ)/φ
δh
φ
φ
¯
¯
= γA γ(I1 + µg ) + (1 − γ)I2
(I¯1 + µg )φ−1 .
δµg

(3)

The simplest production technology is the perfect substitutability case where φ = 1.
In this case:
δh
= γA.
δµg
Damage to adult human capital is proportional to the share parameter on period 1
investments, and is unrelated to the investment level I¯1 .
2

We include the subscript here because environmental influences at some aggregated geographic level
g may provide exogenous variation in early childhood investments.

5

For less than perfect substitutability between periods, there is diminishing marginal
productivity of the investment inputs. Thus, shocks experienced at different baseline
investment levels have heterogenous effects on h. Other things equal, those with higher
baseline levels of investment will experience more muted effects in h than those where
baseline investment is low. A recurring empirical finding is that long-term damage due
to shocks is more likely among poorer families [Currie and Hyson, 1999]. This is in part
due to the fact that children in poorer families are subject to more or larger early-life
shocks [Case, Lubotsky, and Paxson, 2002, Currie and Stabile, 2003].

However, it is

also possible that the same shock will have a greater impact among children in poorer
families if these children have lower period t investment levels to begin with. This occurs
because they are on a steeper portion of the production function. Ceteris paribus, this
would tend to accentuate the effect of an equivalent-sized µg shock on h among poor
families.3,4
2.2.1

Remediation

Is it possible to alter “bad” early trajectories? In other words, what is the effect of a
0

shock µg > 0 experienced during the second period on h? Remediation is of interest to
the extent that (3) is substantially less than zero. However, large damage to h from µg
per se says little about the potential effectiveness of remediation in the second period
as both initial damage and remediation are distinct functions of the three parameters
A, γ, and φ.
The effectiveness of remediation relative to initial damage is:
0

δh/δµg
1−γ
=
δh/δµg
γ

I¯1 + µg
I¯2 + µ0g

!1−φ
.

(4)

Thus, for I¯1 > I¯2 and a given value of γ, a unit of remediation will be more effective
at low elasticities of substitution – the lack of I¯2 was the more critical shortfall prior
to the shock. If I¯1 < I¯2 high elastiticites of substitution increase the effectiveness of
remediation – adding to the existing abundance of I¯2 remains effective.
Fortunately, it is not necessary to observe investments and estimate all three parameters in order to assess the scope for remediation. In some cases, we merely need
i.e. δ 2 h/δµg δI1 < 0. On the other hand, δ 2 h/δµg δI2 > 0 so lower period two investments would
tend to reduce damage to h from µg . The ratio of the former effect to the latter is proportional to
γ/(1 − γ) [Chiang, 1984]. Thus, damage from a period 1 shock is more likely to be concentrated among
poor families when the period-1 share parameter (γ) is high.
4
The cross-effect δ 2 h/δµg δI2 is similar to dynamic complementarity, but Heckman [2007] reserves
this term for the cross-partial between the stock and flow, i.e. δ 2 h/δh0 δIt for t=1, 2 in the example of
Section 2.1.

to observe how a shock in the second period, µg , affects h. Furthermore, this does not
necessarily require a distinct shock in addition to µg . In an overlapping generations
framework, the same shock, µg = µg 0 could affect one cohort in the first childhood period (but not the second) and an older cohort in the second period (but not the first).
For a small, “double-barrelled” shock, we would have a reduced form estimates of both
the damage in (3) and the potential to alter trajectories in (4).5 For example, in addition to observing how income during the prenatal period affects newborn health [Kehrer
and Wolin, 1979], we might also be able to see how parental income affects the health
of pre-school age children to gain a sense of what opportunities there are to remediate
negative income shocks experienced during pregnancy.

2.3

Responsive Investments

Most analyses of “early origins” focus on estimating the reduced form effect, δh/δµg .
Whether this empirical relationship represents a purely biological effect or also includes
the effect of responsive investments is an open question. In general, to the extent that
“early origins” are important, so too will any response of childhood investments to µg .
For expositional purposes, we will consider µg < 0 and responses that either magnify or
attenuate initial damage.
Unless the investment response is costless, damage estimates which monetize δh/δµg
alone will tend to understate total damage. In the extreme, investment responses could
fully offset the effect of early-life shocks on h but this would not mean that such shocks
were costless [Deschnes and Greenstone, 2007]. More generally, the damage from earlylife shocks will be understated if we focus only on long-term effects and there are compensatory investments (i.e. investments that are negatively correlated with the early-life
shock (δI2∗ /δµg < 0)). The cost of investments which help remediate damage should be
included. But even when the response is reinforcing (δI2∗ /δµg > 0), total costs can still
be understated by focussing on the reduced form damage to h alone (see below).
To consider correlated investment responses more formally, we assume parents observe µg at the end of the first period. The direction of the investment response –
whether reinforcing or compensatory – will be shaped by how substitutable period 2
investments are for those in period 1. If substitutability is high, the optimal response
will tend to be compensatory, and thereby help offset damage to h.
A compensatory response is readily seen in the case of perfect substitutability. Cunha
and Heckman [2007] observed that economic models commonly assume that production

at different stages of childhood are perfect substitutes. When φ = 1, (2) reduces to:


h = A γ(I1 + µg ) + (1 − γ)I2 .

(5)

This linear production technology is akin to that used in a previous Handbook chapter
on intergenerational mobility [Solon, 1999], which likewise considered parental investments in children’s human capital. Further, Solon [1999] assumed parent’s utility trades
off own consumption against the child’s human capital:
Up = U (C, h),

(6)

where p denotes parents and C their consumption. The budget constraint is:
Yp = C + I1 + I2 /(1 + r).

(7)

With standard preferences, changes to h through µg will “unbalance” the marginal
utilities in h versus C.6 If µg is negative, the marginal utility of h becomes too high
relative to that in consumption. The technology in (5) permits parents to convert
some consumption into h at a constant rate. This will cause I2∗ to increase, which
attenuates the effect of the µg damage. This attenuation comes at the cost of reduced
parental utility. Similarly, if µg is positive parents will “spend the bounty” (at least
in part), reduce I2∗ and increase consumption. Again, this will temper effects on h,
leading to an understatement of biological effects in analyses that ignore investments
(or parental utility). In either case, perfect substitutability hard-wires the response to
be compensatory.
The polar opposite technology is perfect complementarity between childhood stages,
i.e., a Leontieff production function. Here, a compensatory strategy would be completely
ineffective in mitigating changes to h. As h is determined by the minimum of period 1 and
period 2 investments, optimal period 2 investments should reinforce µg . If µg is negative,
parents would seek to reduce I2 and consume more. Despite higher consumption, parents’
utility is reduced on net due to the shock (or this bundle of lower h and higher C would
have been selected absent µg ). Again, the full-cost of a negative µg shock is understated
when parental utility is ignored.
The crossover between reinforcing and compensating responses of I2∗ will occur at
an intermediate parameter value of substitutability. (The fixed investments case of
Section 2.2 can be seen to reflect an optimized response at this point of balance between

factor, preference parameters, and prices of C versus I which have been ignored.

reinforcing and compensating responses). The value of φ at this point of balance will
depend on the functional form of parental preferences in (6), as shown for CES utility
in Appendix B.
To take a familiar example, assume a Cobb-Douglas utility function of the form:
Up = (1 − α)logC + αlogh.

(8)

If the production technology is also Cobb-Douglas (φ = 0), then no change to I2∗ is
warranted. If instead substitution between period 1 and period 2 is relatively easy
(φ > 0), compensating for the shock is optimal. If substitution is relatively difficult
(φ < 0), then parents should “go with the flow” and reinforce. For this reason, whether
conventional reduced form analyses under or over-state “biological” effects (effects with
I2 held fixed) depends on how easy it is to substitute the timing of investments across
childhood. If the elasticity of substitution across periods is low, then it may be optimal
for parents to reinforce the effect of a shock.
Tension between preferences and the production technology may also be relevant
for within-family investment decisions. For example, Behrman, Pollak, and Taubman
[1982] considered parental preferences that parameterize varying degrees of “inequality
aversion” among (multiple) children. Depending on the strength of parents’ inequality
aversion relative to the production technology (as reflected by φ), parents may reinforce or compensate exogenous within-family differences in early-life health and human
capital. If substitutability between periods of childhood is sufficiently difficult (low φ),
reinforcement of sibling differences will be optimal. This reinforcement may be optimal
even when the parents place a higher weight in their utility function on the accumulation
of human capital by the less able sibling (see Appendix C). Thus, empirical evidence that
some parents reinforce early-life shocks could reveal less about “human nature” than it
would reveal about the developmental nature of the childhood production technology.

3

Methods

As discussed above, we confine our discussion to methodological issues that seem particularly germane to the early influences literature.

One of these is the question of

when sibling fixed effects (or maternal fixed effects) estimation is appropriate. Fixed
effects can be a powerful way to eliminate confounding from shared family background
characteristics, even when these are not fully observed. This approach is particularly
effective when the direction of unobserved sibling-specific confounders can be signed.
9

For example, Currie and Thomas [1995] find that in the cross-section, children who were
in Head Start do worse than children who were not. However, compared to their own
siblings, Head Start children do better. Since there is little evidence that Head Start
children are “favored” by parents or otherwise (on the contrary, in families where one
child attends and the other does not, children who attended were more likely to have
spent their preschool years in poverty), these contrasting results suggest that unobserved family characteristics are correlated both with Head Start attendance and poor
child outcomes. When the effect of such characteristics is accounted for, the positive
effects of Head Start are apparent.
However, fixed effects can not control for sibling-specific factors. The theory discussed above suggests that it may be optimal for parents to either reinforce or compensate for the effects of early shocks by altering their own investment behaviors. Whether
parents do or do not reinforce/compensate obviously has implications for the interpretation of models estimated using family fixed effects. If on average, families compensate, then fixed effects estimates will understate the total effect of the shock (when the
compensation behavior is unobserved or otherwise not accounted for). In some circumstances, such a bias might be benign in the sense that any significant coefficient could
then be interpreted as a lower bound on the total effect. It is likely to be more problematic if parents systematically reinforce shocks, because then any effect that is observed
results from a combination of underlying effects and parental reactions rather than the
shock itself. In the extreme, if parents seized on a characteristic that was unrelated to
ability and systematically favored children who had that characteristic, then researchers
might wrongly conclude that the characteristic was in fact linked to success even in the
absence of parental responses.
The issue of how parents allocate resources between siblings has received a good deal
of attention in economics, starting with Becker and Tomes [1976] and Behrman, Pollak,
and Taubman [1982]. Some empirical studies from developing countries find evidence of
reinforcing behavior (see Rosenzweig and Schultz [1982], Rosenzweig and Wolpin [1988],
Pitt et al. [1990]). Empirical tests of these theories in developed countries such as the
United States and Britain generally use adult outcomes such as completed education
as a proxy for parental investments (see for example, Griliches [1979], Behrman et al.
[1994], Ashenfelter and Rouse [1998]).
Several recent studies have used birth weight as a measure of the child’s endowment
and asked whether explicit measures of parental investments during early childhood are
related to birth weight. For example, Datar, Kilburn, and Loughran [2010] use data
from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-Child and show that low birth weight

10

children are less likely to be breastfed, have fewer well-baby visits, are less likely to be
immunized, and are less likely to attend preschool than normal birth weight siblings.
However, all of these differences could be due to poorer health among the low birth
weight children. For example, if a child is receiving many visits for sick care, they may
receive fewer visits for well care and this will not say anything about parental investment
behaviors. Hence, Datar, Kilburn, and Loughran [2010] also look at how the presence
of low birth weight siblings in the household affects the investments received by normal
birth weight children.

They find no effect of having a low birth weight sibling on

breastfeeding, immunizations, or preschool. The only statistically significant interaction
is for well-baby care. This could however, be due to transactions costs. It may be the
case that if the low birth weight sibling is getting a lot of medical care, it is less costly
to bring the normal birth weight child in for care as well, for example.
Del Bono, Ermisch, and Francesconi [2008] estimate a model that allows endowments
of other children to affect parental investments in the index child. They find, however,
that the results from this dynamic model are remarkably similar to those of mother fixed
effects models in most cases.

Moreover, although they find a positive effect of birth

weight on breastfeeding, the effect is very small in magnitude.
We conducted our own investigation of this issue using data on twins from the Early
Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), using twin differences to control
for potential confounders. At the same time, twins routinely have large differences in
endowment in the form of birth weight. Table 2 presents estimates for all twins (with
and without controls for gender), same sex twins, and identical twins. Overall, there
are very few significant differences in the treatment of these twins: Parents seemed to
be more concerned about whether the low birth weight twin was ready for school, and
to delay introducing solid food (but this is only significant in the identical twin pairs).
We see no evidence that parents are more likely to praise, caress, spank or otherwise
treat children differently, and despite their worries about school readiness, parents have
similar expectations regarding college for both twins. This table largely replicates the
basic finding of Royer [2009], who also considered parental investments and birth weight
differences in the ECLS-B data. In particular, Royer [2009] focussed on investments soon
after birth, finding that breastfeeding, NICU admission, and other measures of neonatal
medical care did not vary with within twin pair birth weight differences.
The parental investment response has also been explored in the context of natural
experiments. Kelly [2009] asked whether observed parental investments (e.g., time spent
reading to child) were related to flu-induced damages to test scores in the 1958 British
birth cohort study but did not detect an investment response.

11

In an interesting contribution to this literature, Hsin [2009] looks at the relationship
between children’s endowments, measured using birth weight, and maternal time use
using data from the Child Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. She
finds that overall, there is little relationship between low birth weight and maternal time
investments.

However, she argues that this masks important differences by maternal

socioeconomic status. In particular, she finds that in models with maternal fixed effects,
less educated women spend less time with their low birth weight children, while more
educated women spend more time. This finding is based on only 65 sibling pairs who
had differences in the incidence of low birth weight, and so requires some corroboration.
Still, one interpretation of this result in the context of the Section 2 framework is that the
elasticity of substitution between C and h varies by socioeconomic status. In particular,
if ϕpoor > ϕrich , low income parents tend to view their consumption and children’s h
as relatively good substitutes. This would lead low-income parents to be more likely to
reinforce a negative shock than high-income parents (assuming that the developmental
technology, captured by γ and φ, does not vary by socioeconomic status). A second
possible interpretation of the finding is that parents’ responses may reflect their budget
constraint more than their preferences. If parents would like to invest in both children,
but have only enough resources to invest adequately in one, then they may be forced
to choose the more well endowed child.7 Interventions that relaxed resource constraints
would have quite different effects in this case than in the case in which parents preferred
to maximize the welfare of a favored child. More empirical work on this question seems
warranted. For example, the PSID-CDS in 1997 and 2002 has time diary data for several
thousand sibling pairs which have not been analyzed for this purpose.
Parent’s choices are determined in part by the technologies they face, and these
technologies may change over time, with implications for the potential biases in fixed
effects estimates.8 For example, Currie and Hyson [1999] asked whether the long term
effects of low birth weight differed by various measures of parental socioeconomic status
in the 1958 British birth cohort. They found little evidence that they did (except that
low birth weight women from higher SES backgrounds were less likely to suffer from
poor health as adults). But it is possible that this is because there were few effective
interventions for low birth weight infants in 1958. In contrast, Currie and Moretti [2007]
7

In the siblings model of Appendix C, this can be seen in the case of a Leontief production technology, where the second period investments generate increases in h only up to the level of first period
investments. If parental income Ȳ falls below the cost of maintaining the initial investment level 2I¯+ µg
∗
¯ but not in child a (i.e.,
in the second period, it may be optimal to invest fully in child b (i.e. I2b
= I),
∗
I2a < I¯ + µg ), who experiences the negative first-period shock.

For example, the effectiveness of remedial investments would change over time if γ varied with the
birth cohort. Remediation would be more effective for later cohorts if γ t > γ t+1 in equation (4).

looked at Californian mothers born in the late 1960s and 70s and find that women born
in low income zip codes were less educated and more likely to live in a low income zipcode
than sisters born in better circumstances. Moreover, women who were low birth weight
were more likely to transmit low birth weight to their own children if they were born in
low income zip codes, suggesting that early disadvantage compounded the initial effects
of low birth weight.
To the extent that behavioral responses to early-life shocks are important empirically,
they will affect estimates of long-term effects whether family fixed effects are employed
or not. Our conclusion is that users of fixed effects designs should consider any evidence
that may be available about individual child-level characteristics and whether parents
are reinforcing or compensating for the particular early childhood event at issue. This
information will inform the appropriate interpretation of the estimates. There is little evidence at present that parents in developed countries systematically reinforce or
compensate for early childhood events, but more research is needed on this question.

3.1

Power

Given that there are relatively few data sets with information about early childhood
influences and future outcomes, economists may be tempted to make use of relatively
small data sets that happen to have the requisite variables.

Power calculations can

be helpful in determining ex ante whether analysis of a particular data set is likely to
yield any interesting findings.

Table 3 provides two sample calculations.

The first

half of the table considers the relationship between birth weight and future educational
attainment as in Black et al. [2007]. Their key result was that a 1% increase in birth
weight increased high school completion by .09 percentage points. The example shows
that under reasonable assumptions about the distribution of birth weight and schooling
attainment, it requires a sample of about 4000 children to be able to detect this effect in
an OLS regression.

We can also turn the question around and ask, given a sample of a

certain size, how large would an effect have to be before we could be reasonably certain
of finding it in our data? The second half of the table shows that if we were looking
for an effect of birth weight on a particular outcome in a sample of 1,300 children, the
coefficient on (the log of ) birth weight would have to be at least .15 before we could
detect it with reasonable confidence.

If we have reason to believe that the effect is

smaller, then it is not likely to be useful to estimate the model without more data.

Data Constraints

The lack of large-scale longitudinal data (i.e. data that follows the same persons
over time) has been a frequent obstacle to evaluating the long-term impacts of early
life influences. Nevertheless, the answer may not always be to undertake collection of
new longitudinal data. Drawbacks include the high costs of data collection; the fact
that long term outcomes cannot be assessed for some time; and the fact that limiting
sample attrition is particularly costly.

Unchecked, attrition in longitudinal data can

pose challenges for inference.
3.2.1

Leveraging Existing Datasets

In many cases, existing cross-sectional microdata can serve as a platform for constructing
longitudinal datasets. First, it may be possible to add retrospective questions to ongoing
data collections. Second, it may be possible to merge new group-level information to
existing data sets. Third, it may be possible to merge administrative data sets by
individual in order to address previously unanswerable questions. The primary obstacle
to implementing each of these data strategies is frequently data security. Depending on
the approach adopted, there are different demands on data security, as described below.
Smith [2009] and Garces et al. [2002] are examples of adding retrospective questions
to existing data collections. Smith had retrospective questions about health in childhood
added to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). The PSID began in the 1960s with
a representative national sample, and has followed the original respondents and their
family members every since. Using these data, Smith [2009] is able to show that adult
respondents who were in poor health during childhood have lower earnings than their
own siblings who were not in poor health. Such comparisons are possible because the
PSID has data on large numbers of sibling pairs. Garces et al. [2002] added retrospective
questions about Head Start participation to the PSID, and were able to show that young
adults who had attended Head Start had higher educational attainment, and were less
likely to have been booked or charged with a crime than siblings who had not attended.
While these approaches may enable analyses of long-term impacts even in the absence of suitable “off the shelf” longitudinal data, they have their drawbacks. First,
retrospective data may be reported with error, although it may be possible to assess
the extent of reporting error using data from other sources. Second, only outcomes
that are already in the data can be assessed, so the need for serendipity remains. Still,
the method is promising enough to suggest that on-going, government funded data collections should build-in mechanisms whereby researchers can propose the addition of
14

questions to subsequent waves of the survey.
A second way to address long-term questions is to merge new information at the
group level to existing data sets. The merge generally requires the use of geocoded
data. For some purposes, such as exploring variations in policies across states, only a
state identifier is required. For other purposes, such as examining the effects of traffic
patterns on asthma, ideally the researcher would have access to exact latitude and
longitude.

There are many examples in which this approach has been successfully

employed. For example, Ludwig and Miller [2007] study the long term effects of Head
Start which exploits the fact that the Office of Economic Opportunity initially offered the
300 poorest counties in the country assistance in applying for Head Start. They show,
using data from the National Educational Longitudinal Surveys, that children who were
in counties just poor enough to be eligible for assistance were much more likely to have
attended Head Start than children in counties that were just ineligible. They go on to
show that child mortality rates in the relevant age ranges were lower in counties whose
Head Start enrollments were higher due to the OEO assistance. Using Census data
they find that education is higher for people living in areas with higher former Head
Start enrollment rates. Unfortunately, however, neither the decennial Census nor the
American Community Survey collect county of birth, so they cannot identify people who
were born in these counties (substantial measurement error is obviously introduced by
using county of residence or county where someone went to school as a proxy for county
of birth). An exciting crop of new research would be enabled by the addition of Census
survey questions on county of birth, as well as county of residence at key developmental
ages (e.g., ages 5 and 14).9
In addition to the observational approaches described above, an intriguing possibility
is that participants in a completed randomized trial could be followed up. For instance,
Rush, Stein, and Susser [1980] conducted a randomized intervention of a prenatal nutrition program in Harlem during the early 1970s. Following these children over time
would allow researchers to evaluate cognitive outcomes in secondary school, and it might
be possible to collect retrospective data on parental investments during childhood, and
to evaluate whether parental investments were affected by the randomization.
9

In another example, Currie and Gruber [1996b] were able to examine the effects of the Medicaid
expansions on the utilization of care among children by merging state-level information on Medicaid
policy to data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). At the time, this was only possible
because one of the authors had access to the NHIS state codes through his work at the Treasury Department. It has since become easier to access geocoded health data either by travelling to Washington
to work with the data, or by using it in one of the secure data centers that Census and the National
Centers for Healh Statistics (NHCS) support. However, it remains a source of frustration to health
researchers that NCHS does not make state codes and/or codes for large counties available on its public
use data sets.

15

A third approach to leveraging existing data merges administrative records from
multiple sources at the individual level, which obviously requires personal identifiers
such as names and birth dates or social security numbers. Access to such identifiers
is especially sensitive. Nevertheless, it constitutes a powerful way to address many
questions of interest. Several important studies have successfully exploited this approach
outside of the US. For example, Sandra E. Black and Salvanes [2005], Black et al. [2007]
use Norwegian data on all twins born over 30 years to look at long-term effects of
birth weight, birth order, and family size on educational attainment. Currie, Stabile,
Manivong, and Roos (forthcoming) use Canadian data on siblings to examine the effects
of health shocks in childhood on future educational attainment and welfare use. Almond,
Edlund, and Palme [2009] use Swedish data to look at the long term effects of low-level
radiation exposure from the Chernobyl disaster on children’s educational attainment.
In the U.S., Doyle [2008] uses administrative data from child protective services and
the criminal justice system in Illinois to examine the effects of foster care. He shows first
that there is considerable variation between foster care case workers in whether or not
a child will be sent to foster care. Moreover, whether a child is assigned to a particular
worker is random, depending on who is on duty at the time a call is received. Using this
variation, Doyle shows that the marginal child assigned to foster care is significantly
more likely to be incarcerated in future.

These examples exploit large sample sizes,

objective indicators of outcomes, sibling or cohort comparisons, as well as a long follow
up period. Some limitations of using existing data include the fact that administrative
data sets often contain relatively little background information, and that outcomes are
limited to those that are collected in the data bases. Finally, the application process to
obtain individual-matched data is often protracted.
Looking forward, the major challenge to research that involves either merging new
information to existing data sets, or merging administrative data sets to each other,
is that privacy concerns are making it increasingly difficult to obtain data just as it
is becoming more feasible to link them. In some cases, access to public use data has
deteriorated. For example, for many years, individual level Vital Statistics Natality data
from birth certificates included the state of birth, and the county (for counties with over
100,000 population). Since 2005, however, these data elements have been suppressed
and it is now necessary to get special permission to obtain U.S. Vital Statistics data
with geocodes.

16

3.2.2

Improvements in the Production of Administrative Data

There are several “first best” potential solutions to these problems. First, creators of
large data sets need to be sensitive to the fact that their data may well be useful for
addressing questions that they have not envisaged. In order to preserve the ability to use
data to answer future questions, it is essential to retain information that can be used for
linkage. At a minimum, this should include geographic identifiers at the smallest level of
disaggregation that is feasible (for example a Census tract). Ideally, personal identifiers
would also be preserved.
Second, more effort needs to be expended in order to make sensitive data available to
researchers. A range of mechanisms exist that protect privacy while enabling research:
1. Suppress small cells or merge small cells in public use data files. For example,
NCHS data sets such as NHIS could be released with state identifiers for large
states, and with identifiers for groups of smaller states.
2. Add small amounts of “noise” to public use data sets, or do data swapping in
order to prevent identification of outliers. For example, Cornell University is coordinating the NSF-Census Bureau Synthetic Data Project which seeks to develop
public-use “analytically valid synthetic data” from micro datasets customarily accessed at secure Census Research Data Centers.
3. Create model servers. In this approach, users login to estimate models using the
true data, but get back output that does not allow individuals to be identified.
4. Data use agreements. The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the National
Educational Longitudinal Survey have successfully employed data use agreements
with qualified users for many years, and without any documented instances of data
disclosure.
5. Creation of de-identified merged files. For example, Currie, Neidell, and Schmieder
[2009a] asked the state of New Jersey to merge birth records with information about
the location of pollution sources, and create a de-identified file. This allows them
to study the effect of air pollution on infant health.
6. Secure data facilities. The Census Research Data Centers have facilitated access
to much confidential data, although researchers who are not located close to the
facilities may still face large costs of accessing them.

17

These approaches to data dissemination have been explored in the statistics literature
for more than 20 years (see Dalenius and Reiss [1982], and have been much discussed at
Census (see for example, Reznek [2007]).
3.2.3

Additional Issues

We conclude with two new and relatively unexplored data issues.

First, how can

economists make effective use of the burgeoning literature on biomarkers? These measures have recently been added to existing health surveys, such as the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health data. Biomarkers include not only information about
genetic variations but also hormones such as cortisol (which is often interpreted as a
measure of stress). It is tempting to think of these markers as potential instrumental
variables [Fletcher and Lehrer, 2009]. For instance, if it was known that a particular gene
was linked to alcoholism, then one might think of using the gene as an instrument for
alcoholism. The potential pitfall in this approach is clear if we consider using something
like skin color as an instrument in a human capital earnings function–clearly, skin color
may predict educational attainment, but it may also have a direct effect on earnings.
Just because a variable is “biological” does not mean that it satisfies the criteria for a
valid instrument.
A second issue is the evolving nature of what constitutes a “birth cohort”. Improvements in neonatal medicine have meant that stillbirths and fetal deaths that would previously have been excluded from the census of live births may be increasingly important,
e.g. MacDorman, Martin, Mathews, Hoyert, and Ventura [2005]). Such a compositional
effect on live births may have first order-implications for program evaluation and the
long-term effects literature. Indeed, both the right and left tails of the birth weight
distribution have elongated over time – in 1970 there were many fewer live births with
birthweight either less than 1500 grams or over 4000 grams. To date there has been
little research exploring the implications of these compositional changes.
In summary, there are many secrets currently locked in existing data that researchers
do not have access to. Economists have been skillful in navigating the many data challenges inherent in the analysis of long-term (and sometimes latent) effects. Nevertheless,
we need to explore ways to make more of these data available, and to more researchers.
In many cases, this will be a more cost effective and timely way to answer important
questions than carrying out new data collections.

Empirical Literature: Evidence of Long Term Consequences
What is of importance is the year of birth of the generation or group of individuals under consideration. Each generation after the age of 5 years
seems to carry along with it the same relative mortality throughout adult life,
and even into extreme old age.
Kermack et al. [1934] in The Lancet (emphasis added).
In this section, we summarize recent empirical research findings that experiences

before five have persistent effects, shaping human capital in particular. A hallmark of this
work is the attention paid to identification strategies that seek to isolate causal effects
of the early childhood environment. An intriguing sub-current is the possibility that
some of these effects may remain latent during childhood (at least from the researcher’s
perspective) until manifested in either adolescence or adulthood. Recently, economists
have begun to ask how parents or other investors in human capital (e.g. school districts)
respond to early-life shocks, as suggested by the conceptual framework in Section 2.3.
As the excerpt from Kermack et al. [1934] indicates, the idea that early childhood
experiences may have important, persistent effects did not originate recently, nor did
it first appear in economics. An extensive epidemiological literature has focussed on
the early childhood environment, nutrition in particular, and its relationship to health
outcomes in adulthood. For a recent survey, see Gluckman and Hanson [2006]. This
literature has been criticized within epidemiology for credulous empirical comparisons
(see, e.g. Rasmussen [2001] or editorial in The Lancet [2001]). Absent clearly-articulated
identification strategies, health determinants that are difficult to observe and are therefore omitted from the analysis (e.g., parental concern) are presumably correlated with
the treatment and can thereby generate the semblance of “fetal origins” linkages, even
when such effects do not exist.

4.1

Prenatal Environment

In the 1990s, David J Barker popularized and developed the argument that disruptions
to the prenatal environment presage chronic health conditions in adulthood, including
heart disease and diabetes [Barker, 1992]. Growth is most rapid prenatally and in early
childhood. When growth is rapid, disruptions to development caused by the adverse
environmental conditions may exert life-long health effects. Barker’s “fetal origins”

19

perspective contrasted with the view that pregnant mothers functioned as an effective
buffer for the fetus against environmental insults.10
In Table 4, we categorize prenatal environmental exposures into three groups. Specifically, we differentiate among factors affecting maternal and thereby fetal health (e.g.
nutrition and infection), economic shocks (e.g. recessions), and pollution (e.g. ambient
lead).
4.1.1

Maternal Health

Currie and Hyson [1999] broke ground in economics by exploring whether “fetal origins”
(FO) effects were confined to chronic health conditions in adulthood, or might extend
to human capital measures. Using the British National Child Development Survey, low
birth weight children were more than 25% less likely to pass English and math O-level
tests, and were also less likely to be employed. The finding that test scores were substantially affected was surprising as epidemiologists routinely posited fetal “brain sparing”
mechanisms, whereby adverse in utero conditions were parried through a placental triage
that prioritized neural development over the body, see, e.g., Scherjon et al. [1996]. Furthermore, Stein et al. [1975]’s influential study found no effect of prenatal exposure to
the Dutch Hunger Winter on IQ.
Currie and Hyson [1999] were followed by a series of papers that exploited differences in birthweight among siblings and explored their relationship to sibling differences
in completed schooling. In relatively small samples (approximately 800 families), Conley
and Bennett [2001] found negative but imprecise effects of low birth weight on educational attainment. Statistically significant effects of low birth weight on educational
attainment were found when birth weight was interacted with being poor, but in general
sample size prevented detection of all but the largest effects (see Section 3.1). Using a
comparable sample size, Behrman and Rosenzweig [2004] found the schooling of identical
female twins was nearly one-third of a year longer for a pound increase in birth weight
(454 grams), with relatively imprecise effects on adult BMI or wages.
In light of the above power concerns, Currie and Moretti [2007] matched mothers to
their sisters in half a million birth records from California. Here, low birth weight was
found to have statistically significant negative impacts on educational attainment and
the likelihood of living in a wealthy neighborhood. However, the estimated magnitudes of
the main effects were more modest: low birth weight increased the likelihood of living in a
poor neighborhood by 3% and reduced educational attainment approximately one month
10

For example, it has been argued that nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy (morning sickness)
is an adaptive response to prevent maternal ingestion of foods that might be noxious to the fetus.

20

on average. Like Conley and Bennett [2001], the relationship was substantially stronger
for the interaction between low birth weight and being born in poor neighborhoods.
In a sample of Norwegian twins, Black, Devereux, and Salvanes [2007] also found
long-term effects of birth weight, but did not detect any heterogeneity in the strength
of this relationship by parental socioeconomic status.11 Oreopoulos et al. [2008] find
similar results for Canada and Lin and Liu [2009] find positive long term effects of birth
weight in Taiwan. Royer [2009] found long-term health and educational effects within
California twin pairs, with a weaker effect of birth weight than several other studies,
esp. Black, Devereux, and Salvanes [2007]. Responsive investments could account for
this discrepancy if they differed between California and elsewhere (within twin pairs).
Alternatively, there may be more homogeneity with respect to socioeconomic status in
Scandanavia than in California. As described in Section 3, Royer [2009] analyzed investment measures directly with the ECLS-B data, concluding that there was no evidence
of compensatory or reinforcing investments (see Section 2.2).
Following a literature in demography on seasonal health effects, Doblhammer and
Vaupel [2001] and Costa and Lahey [2005] focused on the potential long-term health
effects of birth season. A common finding is that in the northern hemisphere, people
born in the last quarter of the year have longer life expectancies than those born in
the second quarter. Both the availability of nutrients can vary seasonally (particularly
historically), as does the likelihood of common infections (e.g., pneumonia). Therefore,
either nutrition or infection could drive this observed pattern. Almond [2006] focused
on prenatal exposure to the 1918 Influenza Pandemic, estimating that children of infected mothers were 15% less likely to graduate high school and wages were between 5
and 9% lower. Kelly [2009] found negative effects of prenatal exposure to 1957 “Asian
flu” in Britain on test scores, though the estimated magnitudes were relatively modest.
Interestingly, while birth weight was reduced by flu exposure, this effect appears to be
independent of the test score effect. Finally, Field, Robles, and Torero [2009] found that
prenatal iodine supplementation raised educational attainment in Tanzania by half a
year of schooling, with larger impacts for girls.
4.1.2

Economic Shocks

A second set of papers considers economic shocks around the time of birth. Here, health
in adulthood tends to be the focus (not human capital), and findings are perhaps less
consistent than in the studies of nutrition and infection described above. Berg et al.
11

Royer [2009] notes that Black, Devereux, and Salvanes [2007] find a “negligible effect of birth weight
on high school completion for the 1967-1976 birth cohort, but for individuals born between 1977 and
1986, the estimate is nearly six times as large.”

21

[2006]’s basic result is that adult survival in the Netherlands is reduced for those born
during economic downturns. In contrast, Cutler et al. [2007] detected no long term
morbidity effects in the Health and Retirement Survey data for cohorts born during
the Dustbowl era of 1930s. Banerjee, Duflo, Postel-Vinay, and Watts [2009] found that
shocks to the productive capacity of French vineyards did not have detectable effects on
life expectancy or health outcomes, but did reduce height in adulthood. Baten, Crayen,
and Voth [2007] related variations in grain prices in the decade of birth to numeracy
using an ingenious measure based on “age heaping” in the British Censuses between
1851 and 1881.

Persons who are more numerate are less likely to round their ages to

multiples of 5 or 10.

They find that children born in decades with high grain prices

were less numerate by this index.
4.1.3

Air Pollution

The third strand of the literature examines the effect of pollution on fetal health. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated links between very severe pollution episodes and
mortality: one of the most famous focused on a “killer fog” in London, England and
found dramatic increases in cardiopulmonary mortality [Logan and Glasg, 1953]. Previous epidemiological research on the effects of moderate pollution levels on prenatal
health suggests negative effects but have produced inconsistent results. Cross-sectional
differences in ambient pollution are usually correlated with other determinants of fetal
health, perhaps more systematically than with nutritional or disease exposures considered above. Many of the pollution studies have minimal (if any) controls for these
potential confounders. Banzhaf and Walsh [2008] found that high-income families move
out of polluted areas, while poor people in-migrate. These two groups are also likely to
provide differing levels of (non-pollution) investments in their children, so that fetuses
and infants exposed to lower levels of pollution may tend to receive, e.g., better quality
prenatal care. If these factors are unaccounted for, this would lead to an upward bias in
estimates. Alternatively, certain pollution emissions tend to be concentrated in urban
areas, and individuals in urban areas may be more educated and have better access to
health care, factors that may improve health. Omitting these factors would lead to a
downward bias, suggesting the overall direction of bias from confounding is unclear.
Two studies by Chay and Greenstone [2003b,a] address the problem of omitted confounders by focusing on “natural experiments” provided by the implementation of the
Clean Air Act of 1970 and the recession of the early 1980s. Both the Clean Air Act and
the recession induced sharper reductions in particulates in some counties than in others,
and they use this exogenous variation in levels of pollution at the county-year level to
22

identify its effects. They estimate that a one unit decline in particulates caused by the
implementation of the Clean Air Act (recession) led to between five and eight (four and
seven) fewer infant deaths per 100,000 live births. They also find some evidence that
the decline in Total Suspended Particles (TSPs) led to reductions in the incidence of low
birth weight. However, only TSPs were measured at that time, so that they could not
study the effects of other pollutants. And the levels of particulates studied by Chay and
Greenstone are much higher than those prevalent today; for example, PM10 (particulate
matter of 10 microns or less) levels have fallen by nearly 50 percent from 1980 to 2000.
Several recent studies consider natural experiments at more recently-encountered
pollution levels. For example, Currie, Neidell, and Schmieder [2009a] use data from birth
certificates in New Jersey in which they know the exact location of the mothers residence,
and births to the same mother can be linked.

They focus on a sample of mothers

who live near pollution monitors and show that variations in pollution from carbon
monoxide (which comes largely from vehicle exhaust) reduces birth weight and gestation.
Currie and Walker [2009] exploit a natural experiment having to do with introduction
of electronic toll collection devices (E-ZPass) in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Since
much of the pollution produced by automobiles occurs when idling or accelerating back
to highway speed, electronic toll collection greatly reduces auto emissions in the vicinity
of a toll plaza. Currie and Walker [2009] compare mothers near toll plazas to those who
live near busy roadways but further from toll plazas and find that E-ZPass increased birth
weight and gestation. They show that they obtain similar estimates following mothers
over time and estimating mother fixed effects models. These papers are notable in part
because it has proven more difficult to demonstrate effects of pollution on fetal health
than on infant health, as discussed further below. Hence, it appears that being in utero
may be protective against at some forms of toxic exposure (such as particulates) but not
others.
This literature on the effects of air pollution is closely related to that on smoking.
Smoking is, afterall, the most important source of indoor air pollution. Medical research
has shown that nicotine constricts the oxygen supply to the fetus, so there is an obvious
mechanism for smoking to affect infant health. Indeed, there is near unanimity in the
medical literature that smoking is the most important preventable cause of low birth
weight. Economists have focussed on ways to address heterogeneity in other determinants of birth outcomes that is likely associated with smoking. Tominey [2007] found
that relative to a conventional multivariate control specification, roughly one-third of the
harm from smoking to birth weight is explained by unobservable traits of the mother.
Moreover, the reduction in birth weight from smoking was substantially larger for low-

23

SES mothers. In a much larger sample, Currie, Neidell, and Schmieder [2009a] showed
that smoking significantly reduced birth weight, even when comparisons are restricted to
within-sibling differences. Moreover, Currie, Neidell, and Schmieder [2009a] document a
significant interaction effect between exposure to carbon monoxide exposure and infant
health in the production of low birth weight, which may help explain the heterogeneity
in birth weight effects reported by Tominey [2007]. Aizer and Stroud [2009] note that
impacts of smoking on birth weight are generally much smaller in sibling comparisons
than in OLS and matching-based estimates. Positing that attenuation bias is accentuated in the sibling comparisons, Aizer and Stroud [2009] use serum cotinine levels as an
instrument for measurement error in smoking and find that sibling comparisons yield
similar birth weight impacts (around 150 grams). Lien and Evans [2005] use increases in
state excise taxes as an instrument for smoking and find large effects of smoking on birth
weight (182 grams) as a result. Using propensity score matching, Almond, Chay, and
Lee [2005] document a large decrease in birth weight from prenatal smoking (203 grams),
but argue that this weight decrease is weakly associated with alternative measures of
infant health, such as prematurity, APGAR score, ventilator use, and infant mortality.
Some recently-released data will enable new research on smoking’s short and longterm effects. In 2005, twelve states began using the new U.S. Standard Certificate of
Live Birth (2003 revision). Along with other new data elements (e.g., on surfactant
replacement therapy), smoking behavior is reported by trimester. It will be useful to
consider whether smoking’s impact on birth weight varies by trimester, and also whether
smoking is more closely tied to other measures of newborn health if it occurs early versus
late in pregnancy. Second, there is relatively little research by economists on the longterm effects of prenatal exposure to smoking. Between 1990 and 2003, there were 113
increases in state excise taxes on cigarettes [Lien and Evans, 2005].12 Since 2005, the
American Community Survey records both state and quarter of birth, permitting linkage
of these data to the changes in state excise taxes during pregnancy.
Almond, Edlund, and Palme [2009] examine the effect of pollution from the Chernobyl disaster on the Swedish cohort that was in utero at the time of the disaster. Since
the path of the radiation was very well measured, they can compare affected children
to those who were not affected as well as to those born in the affected areas just prior
to the disaster. They find that in the affected cohort those who suffered the greatest
radiation exposure were 3 percent less likely to qualify for high school, and had 6%
lower math grades (the measure closest to IQ). The estimated effects were much larger
12

Some states enacted earlier excise taxes: the “average state tax rate increased from 5.7 cents in 1964
to 15.5 cents in 1984” [Farrelly, Nimsch, and James, 2003]; high 1970s inflation can be an additional
potential source of identification as excise taxes were set nominally.

24

within families. A possible interpretation is that cognitive damage from Chernobyl was
reinforced by parents.
To summarize, the recent “fetal origins” literature in economics finds substantial
effects of prenatal health on subsequent human capital and health. As we discuss in
Section 5, this suggests a positive role for policies that improve human capital by affecting the birth endowment. That is, despite being congenital (i.e. present from birth),
this research indicates that the birth endowment is malleable in ways that shape human capital. This finding has potentially radical implications for public policy since it
suggests that one of the more effective ways to improve children’s long term outcomes
might be to target women of child bearing age in addition to focusing on children after
birth.

4.2

Early Childhood Environment

It would be surprising to find that a very severe shock in early childhood (e.g., a head
injury, or emotional trauma) had no effect on an individual. Therefore, a more interesting question from the point of view of research is how developmental linkages operating
at the individual level affect human capital formation in the aggregate. To answer this
question, we need to know how many children are affected by negative early childhood
experiences that could plausibly exert persistent effects? How big and long-lasting are
the effects of less severe early childhood shocks relative to more severe shocks? Taken
together, how much of the differences in adult attainments might be accounted for by
things that happen to children between birth and age five? Furthermore, how are these
linkages between shocks and outcomes mediated or moderated by third factors? For
example, is the effect of childhood lead exposure on subsequent test scores stronger for
families of lower socioeconomic status (i.e. is the interaction with SES an important
one) and if so why? Alternatively, is the effect of injury mediated by health status, or
is the causal pathway a direct one to cognition?
We might also wish to know how parents respond to early childhood shocks. To
date, there has been less focus on this question in the early childhood period than in
the prenatal period, perhaps because it seems less plausible to hope to uncover a “pure”
biological effect of a childhood shock given that children are embedded in families and in
society. However, this embeddedness opens the possibility that a richer set of behavioral
responses – of the kind considered by economists – might be at play. Furthermore, early
childhood admits a wider set of environmental influences than the prenatal period. For
example, abuse in early childhood can be distinguished from malnutrition, a distinction
more difficult for the in utero period, and these may have quite different effects.
25

We define early childhood as starting at birth and ending at age five. From an
empirical standpoint, early childhood so defined offers advantages and disadvantages
over analyses that focus on the prenatal period. Mortality is substantially lower during
early childhood than in utero, which reduces the scope for selective attrition caused by
environmental shocks to affect the composition of survivors. On the other hand, it is
unlikely that environmental sensitivity during early childhood tapers discontinuously at
any precise age (including age five). From a refutability perspective, we cannot make
sharp temporal comparisons of a cohort “just exposed” to a shock during early childhood
to a neighboring cohort “just unexposed” by virtue of its being too old to be sensitive.
Moreover, it will often be difficult to know a priori whether prenatal or postnatal exposure is more influential.13 Thus, studies of early childhood exposures tend to emphasize
cross-sectional sources of variation, including that at the geographic and individual level.
The studies reviewed in this section focus on tracing out the relationships between events
in early childhood and future outcomes, and are summarized in Table 5.
4.2.1

Infections

Insofar a specific health shocks are considered, infections are the most commonly studied.
In epidemiology, long-term health effects of infections – and the inflammation response
they trigger – has been explored extensively, e.g. Crimmins and Finch [2006]. Outcomes analyzed by economists include height, health status, educational attainment,
test scores, and labor market outcomes. The estimated impacts tend to be large. Using
geographic differences in hookworm infection rates across the US South, Bleakley [2007]
found that eradication after 1910 increased literacy rates but did not increase the amount
of completed schooling, except for Black children. The literacy improvement was much
larger among Blacks than Whites, and stronger among women then men. The return to
education increased substantially, and Bleakley [2007] estimated that hookworm infection throughout childhood reduced wages in adulthood by as much as 40%. Case and
Paxson [2009] focussed on reductions in U.S. childhood mortality from typhoid, malaria,
measles, influenza, and diarrhea during the first half of the 20th Century. They found
that improvements in the disease environment in one’s state of birth were mirrored by
improved cognitive performance at older ages, but like Bleakley [2007], this effect did not
seem to operate through increased years of schooling. However, the estimated cognitive
impacts in Case and Paxson [2009] were not robust to the inclusion of state-specific time
trends in their models.
13

For example, early postnatal exposure to Pandemic influenza apparently had a larger impact on
hearing than did prenatal flu exposure [Heider, 1934].

26

Chay, Guryan, and Mazumder [2009] found that reduced exposure to pneumonia
and diarrhea in early childhood among Blacks during the late 1960s raised subsequent
AFQT and NAEP scores towards those of Whites. Changes in postneonatal mortality
rates (dominated by infections) explained between 50 and 80 percent of the (large)
reduction in the Black-White AFQT gap. Finally, Bozzoli, Deaton, and QuintanaDomeque [2009] highlight that in developing countries, high average mortality rates
cause the selection effect of early childhood mortality to overwhelm the “scarring” effect.
Thus, the positive relationship between early childhood health and subsequent human
capital may be absent in analyses that do not account for selective attrition in high
mortality settings.
4.2.2

Health Status

Many of the studies reviewed in Table 5 investigate the link between health in childhood
and future cognitive or labor market outcomes. These studies can be viewed as a subset
of a broader literature asking whether income affects health, and how health affects
income? For example, using cross-sectional U.S. data, Case et al. [2002] find a striking
relationship between family income and a child’s reported health status, which becomes
stronger as children age.

Their motivation for looking at children is that the child’s

health is unlikely to have a large direct effect on family income, so that the direction
of causality is relatively clear. Currie and Stabile [2003] investigate this relationship
using Canadian panel data and argue that one reason the relationship between income
and child health increases over time is that poorer children are subject to many more
negative health shocks. In fact, in Canada, this is the dominant mechanism driving the
relationship (which is not surprising given that all Canadian children have public health
insurance so that gaps in treatment rates are small).14
The question we focus on here is how much poor health in childhood, in turn, affects
future outcomes.

One of the chief ambiguities in answering this question is what we

mean by health in childhood. While it has become conventional to measure fetal health
using birth weight (though there may be better measures, see Almond, Chay and Lee,
2005) there are a wide variety of different possible measures of child health, ranging
14

Condliffe and Link [2008] argue that in the U.S., differential access to care also plays a role in
the steepening of the relationship between income and child health with age. A number of studies
have investigated this relationship, dubbed “the gradient,” in other countries (c.f. Currie, Shields,
and Price [2007], Case, Lee, and Paxson [2008], Doyle, Walker, and Harmon [2005], Khanam, Nghiem,
and Connelly [2009]). Propper, Rigg, and Burgess [2007] and Khanam, Nghiem, and Connelly [2009]
are particularly interesting because they find that when maternal mental health is controlled, the
relationship between family income and child health disappears, suggesting that it is mediated largely
by factors that affect maternal mental health.

27

from maternal reports about the child’s general health status through questions about
diagnoses of specific chronic conditions, to the occurrence of “adverse events.”
Case and Paxson [2008a,b, 2010a,b] do not have a direct measure of child health, but
argue that adult height is a good proxy for early child health. This is a useful observation
given that most surveys of adults have no direct information on child health. Height
at age 5 is affected by a range of early health shocks including fetal conditions, poor
nutrition, and illness.

In turn, height at age 5 is strongly predictive of adult height.

And like birthweight, it is predictive of many shorter and longer range outcomes.
A second problem is that it is often unclear whether the ill health dates from a
particular period (e.g. an injury) or whether it might reflect a continuing, perhaps a
congenital, condition. For example, Smith [2009] uses data from the Panel Study of
Income Dynamics which asked young adults a retrospective question about their health
status before age 16.

In models with sibling fixed effects, he finds that the sib with

the worse health had significantly lower earnings, although educational attainment was
not significantly affected.

He also finds using data from the Health and Retirement

Survey that reports of general poor health in childhood do tend to be correlated in the
expected way with the presence of specific health conditions. However, it is not possible
to ascertain that the negative effects are due to poor health at any particular “critical”
window. Salm and Schunk [2008] attempt to deal with this problem using detailed health
information from a medical examination of young German children entering school. In
models with sibling fixed effects, they find a significant relationship between poor mental
health and asthma on the one hand, and measures of cognitive functioning on the other.
They control for the child’s birth weight in an effort to distinguish between the effects
of health at birth and health after birth (though to the extent that birth weight is an
imperfect measure of health at birth, it is possible that the other health measures partly
capture congenital conditions).
Currie et al. [2009b] use administrative data from the Canadian province of Manitoba’s public health insurance system to follow children from birth through young adulthood.

Using information about all contacts with medical providers, they construct

measures of whether children suffered injuries, asthma, mental health problems or other
health problems at ages 0 to 3, 4 to 8, 9 to 13, and 14 to 18. It is interesting that even
in a large sample, there were relatively few children with specific health problems other
than injuries, asthma, or mental health problems, so that it was necessary to group the
remaining problems together.

They then look at the relationship between health at

various ages, educational attainment, and use of social assistance as a young adult in
sibling fixed effects models that also control flexibly for birth weight and for the presence

28

of congenital anomalies.

The results are perhaps surprising in view of the conceptual

framework developed in Section 3. When entered by themselves, early childhood health
conditions (at age 0-3 and at age 4-8) are predictive of future outcomes, conditional on
health at birth. However, when early physical health conditions are entered along with
later ones, generally only the later ones matter.

This result suggests that physical

health in early childhood affects future outcomes largely because it affects future health
(i.e., subsequent health mediates the relationship), and not because there is a direct
link between early physical health status and cognition. In contrast, mental health conditions at early ages seem to have significant negative effects on future outcomes even
if there are no intermediate report of a mental health condition. This result suggests
that common mental health problems such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD, also called Attention Deficit Disorder or ADD) or Conduct Disorders (i.e. disorders usually involving abnormal aggression and anti-social behavior) may impair the
process of human capital accumulation even if they do not lead to diagnoses of mental
health disorders in adulthood.
Several recent papers focus specifically on measures of mental health conditions. Currie and Stabile [2006] use questions similar to those on mental health “screeners” which
were administered to large samples of children in the U.S. and Canada in two national
surveys. They find that children whose scores indicated mental health problems in 1994
had worse outcomes as of 2002-4 than siblings without such problems. They controlled
for birth weight (among other variables) and estimated models with and without including children with diagnosed learning disabilities. In all specifications, they found
negative effects of high ADHD scores on test scores on schooling attainment. Smith
and Smith [2008] report similar results using data from the PSID which includes retrospective questions about mental health problems before age 16.

Like Smith [2009]

and Currie et al. [2009b] they estimate models with sibling fixed effects, and find significant long term effects of mental health conditions which are much larger than those
of physical health conditions.

Vujic et al. [2008] focus on conduct disorders using a

panel of Australian twins and find that conduct disorder before age 18 has strong negative effects on the probability of high school graduation as well as positive effects on
the probability of criminal activity.

None of these three papers focus specifically on

measures of mental health conditions before age 5 but ”externalizing” mental health
conditions such as ADHD and Conduct Disorder typically manifest themselves at early
ages. Finally, although they are conceptually distinct, many survey measures of mental
health resemble measures of “non-cognitive skills.” Hence, one might interpret evidence
that non-cognitive skills in childhood are important determinants of future outcomes

29

as further evidence of the importance of early mental health conditions [Blanden et al.,
2006, Heckman and Rubinstein, 2001].

4.2.3

Home Environment

The home is one of the most important environments affecting a young child and there
is a vast literature in related disciplines investigating the relationship between different
aspects of the home environment and child outcomes.

We do not attempt to sum-

marize this literature here, but pick three aspects that may be most salient: Maternal
mental health and/or substance abuse, maternal employment, and child abuse/foster
care (which may be considered to be an extreme result of bad parenting). Given the
importance of child mental health and non-cognitive skills, it is interesting to ask how
maternal mental health affects child outcomes? Frank and Meara [2009] examine this
question using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. They include
a rich set of control variables (mother’s cognitive test score, grandparent’s substance
abuse, permanent income) and estimate models with mother fixed effects and models
with propensity scores.

Their estimates suggest large effects (relative to the effects

of income) of contemporaneous maternal depression on the quality of the home environment and on children’s behavioral problems, but little effect on math and reading
scores. Estimates of the effects of maternal substance abuse are mixed, which echoes
the findings of Chatterji and Markowitz [2000] using the same data. Unfortunately, the
authors are not able to look at the long term effects of maternal depression experienced
by children aged 0 to 5 because the depression questions in the NLSY have been added
only recently. As these panel data are extended in time, further investigation of this
issue is warranted.
There is also a large literature, including some papers by economists, examining the
effect of maternal employment at early ages on child outcomes. Much of this literature
suffers from the lack of an appropriate conceptual framework. If we think of child outcomes being produced via some combination of inputs, then the important question is
how maternal employment affects the inputs chosen? This will evidently depend on how
much her employment income relaxes the household budget constraint, and the price and
quality of the child care alternatives and other inputs that are available. Some of the
literature on maternal employment seems to implicitly assume that the mother’s time
is such an important and unique input that no purchased input can adequately replace
it. This may possibly be the case but is a strong assumption. If the mother’s time is
replaceable at some price, then one might expect maternal employment to have quite
30

different effects on women with different levels of household income (moreover, mother’s
time may not all be of equal quality, so that it is easier to replace some mother’s time
than others with the market). This argument suggests that it is extremely important to
consider explicitly the quality of the mother’s time inputs and the availability of potential substitute inputs in models of maternal employment, something that is difficult to
do in most available data sets. Studies that rely on regression methods and propensity
score matching (see Berger et al. [2005], Ruhm [2004] often find small negative effects of
maternal employment (especially in the first year) on children’s cognitive development.
However, two recent studies using variation in maternity leave provisions find that while
more generous maternity leave policies are associated with increased maternal employment, there is little effect on children’s outcomes [Baker and Milligan, 2009, Dustmann
and Schnberg, 2009]. Dustmann and Schnberg [2009] have data that permit cohorts
affected by expansions in German maternity leave laws to be followed for many years.
They see no effect of maternal employment on educational attainment or wages.
Finally, there are a few papers examining the effects of child abuse/foster care on
child outcomes. This is a difficult area to investigate because it is hard to imagine that
abuse (or neglect) can be divorced from other characteristics of the household. Currie
and Widom [2009] use data from a prospective longitudinal study in which abused children (the treatments) were matched to controls.

After following these children until

their mid 40s, they found that the abused children were less likely to be employed, had
lower earnings, and fewer assets, and that these patterns were particularly pronounced
among women.

It is possible that these results are driven by unobserved differences

between the treatments and controls although focusing on various subsets of the data
(e.g. children whose mothers were on welfare; children of single mothers) produced similar results. Currie and Tekin [2006] use data from the National Longitudinal Study
of Adolescent Health to examine the effect of having been abused before age 7 on the
propensity to commit crime. They find strong effects which are quite similar in OLS,
sibling, and twin fixed effects models. It is possible that these results reflect a characteristic of an individual child (such as difficult temperament) which makes it both more
likely that they will be abused and more likely that they will commit crime. However,
controlling directly for measures of temperament and genetic endowments does not alter
the results. The Doyle [2008] study of the effects of foster care on the marginal child is
also summarized in Table 5.

31

4.2.4

Toxic Exposures

Epidemiological studies of postnatal pollution exposure and infant mortality have yielded
mixed results and many are likely to suffer from omitted variables bias. Currie and
Neidell [2005] examine the effect of more recent (lower) levels of pollution on infant
health, along with the role of specific pollutants in addition to particulates (only TSPs
were measured during the time periods analyzed by Chay and Greenstone [2003b,a]).
Using within-zip code variation in pollution levels, they find that a one unit reduction
in carbon monoxide over the 1990s in California saved 18 infant lives per 100,000 live
births. However, unlike Currie, Neidell, and Schmieder [2009a] they were unable to find
any consistent evidence of pollution effects on health at birth, probably because of the
crudeness of their measure of maternal location.
Reyes [2007] found large effects of banning leaded gasoline on crime in the U.S., but
results were not robust to state-specific time trends despite a relatively long panel of
state-level lead measurements. Nilsson [2009] considered reductions in ambient lead levels in Sweden following the banning of lead in gasoline and measures possible exposures
using the concentrations of lead in 1,000 moss (bryophyte) collection sites that have
been maintained by the Swedish environmental protection agency since the early 1970s.
Nilsson [2009] found that early childhood exposure reduced human capital, as reflected
by both grades and graduation rates. These effects persisted when comparisons were
restricted within siblings, and were substantially larger for low-income families.
4.2.5

Summary re: Long Term Effects of Fetal and Early Childhood Environment

The last 10 years have seen an upsurge of empirical work on the long-term effects of
early childhood. As a result, much has been learned. We can state fairly definitively
that at least some things that happen before age five have long-term consequences for
health and human capital. Moreover, these effects are sufficiently large and general to
shape outcomes at the population level. On balance, effects of fetal exposure tend to
be somewhat larger than postnatal effects, but there are important exceptions. Mental
health is a prime example. Mental health conditions and non-cognitive skills seem to
have large, persistent effects independent of those captured by measures of child health
at birth.

Empirical Literature: Policy Responses

The evidence discussed above indicates that prenatal and early childhood often have a
critical influence on later life outcomes. However, by itself this evidence says little about
the effectiveness of remediation. Hence, this section discusses evidence about whether
remediation in the zero to five period can be effective in shaping future outcomes. In
so doing, we take a step away from explicit consideration of an early-childhood shock
ug as in Section 2. Instead, we focus on the specific public policies that may be able
to alter developmental trajectories, often in disadvantaged sub-populations. We begin
with programs that raise income, and then move on to programs that target specific
domains.

5.1

Income Enhancement

In the model sketched above, there are many ways for poverty to affect child outcomes.
Even with identical preferences, poorer parents will make different investment choices
than richer ones. In particular, poor families will optimize at lower investment (and consumption) levels and thereby have children with lower health and human capital, other
things equal. Further, poor parents may face different input prices for certain goods, or
have access to different production technologies. Providing cash transfers addresses the
budgetary problems without necessarily changing the production technology. Hence, it
is of interest to see whether cash transfers, in and of themselves, can improve outcomes.
It is however, remarkably difficult to find examples of policies that increase incomes
without potentially having a direct effect on outcomes. For example, many studies of
cash welfare programs have demonstrated that children who are or have been on welfare remain worse off on average than other children. This does not necessarily mean,
however, that welfare has failed them. Without welfare, their situation might have been
even worse. Berger, Paxson, and Waldfogel (in press) explore the relationship between
family income, home environments, child mental health outcomes, cognitive test scores
using data from the Fragile Families and Child Well-being Study which follows a cohort of five thousand children born in several large U.S. cities between 1998 and 2000.
They show that all of the measures of the home environment they examine (which include measures of parenting skills as well as physical aspects of the home) are highly
related to income and that controlling for these measures reduces the effects of income
on outcomes considerably.
Levine and Zimmerman [2000] showed that children who spent time on welfare scored
lower than other children on a range of tests, but that this difference disappeared when

33

the test scores of their mothers were controlled for, suggesting that welfare had little
effect either positive or negative. Similarly, Levine and Zimmerman [2000] argue that
children of welfare mothers were more likely to grow up to be welfare mothers, mainly
because of other characteristics of the household they grew up in.
Currie and Cole [1993] compare siblings in families where the mother received welfare
while one child was in utero, but not while they other child was in utero, and find no
difference in the birth weight of the siblings. Given that research has shown little evidence of positive effects of cash welfare on children, it is not surprising that the literature
evaluating welfare reform in the United States has produced similarly null findings. The
National Research Council [Smolensky and Gootman, 2003] concluded that “no strong
trends have emerged, either negative or positive, in indicators of parent well-being or
child development across the years just preceding and following the implementation of
[welfare reform].” However, U.S. welfare reform was a complex intervention that changed
many parameters of daily life by, for example, imposing work requirements on recipients.
Conditional tax credits represent an alternative approach to providing income to
poor families, and hence to poor children. The early years of the Clinton administration
in the United States saw a huge expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC),
while in the U.K., the Working Families Tax Credit approximately doubled in 1999.
These are tax credits available to poor working families. Their essential feature is that
they are “refundable”—in other words, a family whose credit exceeds its taxes receives
the difference in cash. The tax credits are like welfare in that they give cash payments
to poor families. But like welfare reform, the tax credits are a complex intervention in
that recipients need to work and file tax returns in order to be eligible, and a great deal
of research has shown that such tax credits affect maternal labor supply and marriage
patterns [Eissa and Liebman, 1996, Meyer and Rosenbaum, 2001, Blundell, 2006]. This
is because the size of the payment increases with earnings up to a maximum level before
being phased out, so that it creates an incentive to work among the poorest households
but a work disincentive for households in the phase-out range. In the U.S., the number
of recipients grew from 12.5 million families in 1990 to 19.8 million in 2003, and the
maximum credit grew from $953 to $4,204. The rapid expansion of this formerly obscure
program run through the tax system has resulted in cash transfers to low-income families
that were much larger than those that were available under welfare. Gundersen and
Ziliak [2004] estimate that the EITC accounted for half of the reduction in after-tax
poverty that occurred over the 1990s (the other half being mainly accounted for by
strong economic growth).
Table 6 provides an overview of some of the research on the effects of income on

34

children. Dahl and Lochner [2005] use variation in the amount of the EITC households
are eligible for over time and household type to identify the effects of household income
and find that each $1,000 of income improves childrens’ test scores by 2 to 4 percent of a
standard deviation. An attractive feature of the changes in the EITC is that households
may well have regarded them as permanent, so this experiment may approximate the
effects of changes in permanent rather than transitory income. Their result implies,
though, that it would take on the order of a $10,000 transfer to having an educationally
meaningful effect on test scores.
Milligan and Stabile [2008] take advantage of a natural experiment resulting from
changes in Canadian child benefits.
reformed at different times.

These benefits vary across provinces and were

An advantage of their research is that the changes in

income were not tied to other changes in family behavior, in contrast to programs like
the EITC. They find that an extra $1,000 of child benefits leads to an increase of about
0.07 of a standard deviation in the math scores and in the Peabody Picture Vocabulary
Test, a standardized test of language ability for four to six year old children.

If we

think of a change of a third or a half a standard deviation in test scores as a meaningful
educational effect, then these results suggest that an increase of as little as $5000 in
family income has a meaningful effect. Milligan and Stabile [2008] go beyond Dahl and
Lochner by examining effects on other indicators. They find that higher child benefits
lower aggression in children and decrease depression scores for mothers. They do not
find much impact on physical health measures, though they do find a decrease in families
reporting that their children went hungry. There is some evidence of gender differences,
with girls showing greater responsiveness to income on the mental health and behavioral
scores while boys show greater responsiveness on test scores.
These findings are extremely intriguing, but raise several questions. First, do the
effects of income vary depending on the child’s age?

Morris et al. [2004] argue that

income is more important at younger ages, though persistent poverty is worst of all.
Second, are there really gender effects in the impact of income, and if so why? Third,
the effects that Milligan and Stabile find are roughly twice those found by Dahl and
Lochner. Is this because the former study a pure income transfer while the later study
a tied transfer? Fourth, will the effects last, or will they be subject to “fade out” as
the children grow older?
Table 6 also includes examples from a growing literature analyzing ”conditional cash
transfer programs” (CCTs). These are programs that tie transfers to specific behavior
on the part of the family.

For example, the parents may be required to make sure

that the children attend school or get medical care in return for the transfer.
35

These

programs have become increasingly popular in developing countries, and have also been
implemented to a limited extent in rich countries (for example, there is a program in New
York City which is being evaluated by Manpower Development Research Corporation).
By their nature, CCTs are complex programs that cannot tell us about the pure impacts
of income. Still, these programs have attracted attention because randomized controlled
trials have shown at least short-term results. It is difficult however to compare across
programs, given that they all tend to focus on different outcomes.
Given this positive evidence about the effects of income, it is a puzzle why so much
aid to poor families is transferred in kind. Currie and Gahvari [2008] survey the many
reasons for this phenomena that have been offered in the economics literature and conclude that the most likely reasons aid is offered in kind are agency problems, paternalism,
and politics. In a nutshell, policy makers and the voters they represent may be more
concerned with ensuring that children have medical care than with maximizing their
parent’s utility, even if the parent’s utility is assumed to be affected by the children’s
access to health care. Politics come in because coherent lobby groups (such as doctors,
teachers, or farmers) may have incentives to advocate for various types of in kind programs.

In any case, in kind programs are an important feature of aid policies in all

Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development states, accounting for over
10% of GDP if health care and educational programs are included. In what follows, we
first discuss “near cash programs” and then programs whose benefits are less fungible
with cash.

5.2

Near-Cash Programs

Programs such as the U.S. Food Stamp Program (FSP, now renamed the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP) and housing assistance are often referred
to as “near cash” programs because they typically offer households benefits that are
worth less than what the household would have spent on food or housing in any case.
Hence, canonical microeconomic theory suggests that households should think of them
as equivalent to cash and that they should have the same impact as the equivalent cash
transfer would have.

In the case of food stamps, it has proven difficult to test this

prediction because the program parameters are set largely at the national level, so that
there is only time series variation.
Currie [2003] provides an overview of the program, and the research on its effects
that had been conducted up to that point. Schanzenbach [forthcoming] uses data from
36

a food stamp cash out experiment to examine the effect on food spending. She finds
that a minority of households actually received more in food stamps than they would
otherwise spend on food. In these constrained households, families did spend more on
food than they would have otherwise, while in other households, food stamps had the
same effect as cash. Unfortunately, there is little evidence that constrained households
bought foods that were likely to have beneficial effects; they seem, for example, to have
spent some of the “extra” food money on products such as soda.
Hoynes and Schanzenbach [2009] use variation from the introduction of the FSP
to identify its effects on food spending.

The FSP began as a small pilot program

in 1961, and gradually expanded over the next 13 years: In 1971, national eligibility
standards were established, and all states were required to inform eligible households
about the program. In 1974, states were required to extend the program statewide if
any areas of the state participated.

Using data from the PSID, the introduction of

the FSP was associated with an 18% increase in food expenditures in the full sample,
with somewhat larger effects in the most disadvantaged households. They find that the
marginal propensity to consume (MPC) food out of food stamp income was .16 compared
to .09 for cash income. Thus, it does seem that many households were constrained to
spend more on food than they otherwise would have (or alternatively, that the person
receiving the food stamps had a stronger preference for food than the person controlling
cash income in the household). From a policy makers point of view, this means that
the FSP has a bigger impact on food spending than an equivalent cash transfer. Still,
it is a leaky bucket if only 16 cents of every dollar transferred goes to food.
Bingley and Walker [2007] conduct an investigation of the Welfare Milk Program in
the U.K.. They identify the effect of the program on household milk expenditures using
a large change in eligibility for the program that had differential effects by household
type. They find that about 80% of a transfer of free milk is crowded out by reductions
in milk purchases by the household. This estimate is quite similar to that of Hoynes
and Schanzenbach, though it still suggests that the in kind transfer is having some effect
on the composition of spending. Details of these two studies are shown in Table 7.
Given that these programs appear to have some effect on food expenditures, it is
reasonable to ask what effect they have on child outcomes. There is a substantial older
literature examining this question (see Currie [2003] for a summary). The modal study
compares eligible participants to eligible non-participants using a multiple regression
model. The main problem with drawing inferences about the efficacy of the FSP from
this exercise is that participants are likely to differ from eligible non-participants in ways
that are not observed by the researcher. Thus, for example, Basiotis et al. [1998] and

37

Butler and Raymond [1996] both find that participation in the FSP reduces consumption
of some important nutrients. Since it is hard to imagine how giving people food coupons
could do this, one suspects that these results are driven by negative selection into the
FSP program.
Several recent papers examining the effects of the FSP on young children are summarized in Table 7.

Currie and Moretti [2008] were the first to try to use variation

in the timing of the introduction of the food stamp program to look at effects on birth
outcomes. Using Vital Statistics Natality data from California, they find that the introduction of the FSP increased the number of births, particularly in Los Angeles County.
They also find some evidence that the FSP increased the probability of fetal survival
among the lightest white infants, but the effect is very small, and only detectable in Los
Angeles. Notably, the FSP increased (rather than decreased) the probability of low birth
weight but the estimated effect is small, and concentrated among teenagers giving birth
for the first time. Thus, it appears that in California, the FSP increased fertility and
infant survival (in some groups) with overall zero or negative effects on the distribution
of birth weight.
Almond et al. [2010] examine the same question using national data, and focus on
receipt of the FSP during the third trimester, when the fetus typically puts on most
of the weight the baby will have at birth.

In contrast to Currie and Moretti, they

find that the introduction of the FSP increased birth weights for whites and had even
larger effects on blacks. The percentage reductions in the incidence of low birth weight
were greater than the percentage increases in mean birth weight, suggesting that the
FSP had its largest effects at the bottom of the birth weight distribution. Almond et
al. find no effect of food stamp receipt in the first trimester of pregnancy and much
weaker evidence for effects of receipt in the second. This suggests that one reason for
the contrast between their results and those of Currie and Moretti is that the latter
did not focus narrowly enough on the relevant part of pregnancy. Moreover, Almond
et al. find larger effects in the South than in other regions, raising the possibility that
overall effects were smaller in California than in other regions.

Finally, it is possible

that the effects in California are obscured by the substantial in-migration that the state
experienced over this period.
Baum [2008] examines the effects of the FSP on weight gain among pregnant women,
with particular attention to whether women gained either less than the recommended
amount or greater than the recommended amount given their pre-pregnancy body mass
index.

He estimates a simultaneous equations model in which weight gain and FSP

participation are jointly determined.

FSP participation is assumed to be affected by
38

various state-level rules about eligibility, outreach and so on.

One difficulty is that

these rules may be affected by other characteristics of states (such as overall generosity
of social programs) which have direct effects on weight gain (e.g. through superior
access to health care during pregnancy). Baum finds that FSP participation reduces
the probability that women experienced inadequate weight gain during pregnancy, but
has no effect on the probability that they gained too much weight. Since inadequate
maternal weight gain is an important risk factor for low birth weight, it is likely that
FSP had a positive effect on birth weights among affected mothers.
As discussed above, the other large category of “near cash” offer subsidized housing.
Many OECD countries have large housing assistance programs, but their effects on
families are understudied. In fact, we were able to find only one paper that examined
the effects of housing programs on the outcomes of children less than five, and only a
handful that examined effects on children at all. These studies are summarized in Table
8.
Since by design, families receiving housing assistance are among the poorest of the
poor, it is clearly important to address the endogeneity of program receipt. Currie
and Yelowitz [2000] look at the effects of living in a public housing project in families
with two children.

They combine information from the Census and from the Survey

of Income and Program Participation in a two-sample instrumental variables framework
where the instrument for receipt of housing assistance is the sex composition of the
siblings (families with a boy and a girl are entitled to larger apartments, and so are
more likely to take up housing benefits). They find that families living in projects are
less likely to be subject to overcrowding and that the children are much less likely to
have been held back in school. The latter effect is three times bigger for boys (who are
more likely to be held back in any case) than for girls. Since most “holding back” occurs
at younger ages (Kindergarten and grade 1), this suggests that this type of assistance is
in fact beneficial for young children.
Goux and Maurin [2005] focus on the effect of overcrowding in France using a similar
instrumental variables strategy:

They argue that children in families in which the

two eldest children are the same sex are more likely to live in crowded conditions in
childhood. They also propose an alternative strategy in which crowding is instrumented
with whether or not the parent was born in an urban area – parents who are from urban
areas are more likely to live in crowded conditions. They find evidence consistent with
Currie and Yelowitz in that crowding has a large and significant effect on the probability
that a child falls behind in school and eventually drops out.
Fertig and Reingold [2007] examine the effect of receipt of public housing assistance

39

using data from the Fragile Families Study and three instruments: The gender composition of children in the household, the supply of public housing in each location, and
the length of waiting lists in each location.

They find mixed estimates of effects on

maternal health and little evidence of an effect on child health, though their samples
are quite small. Newman and Harkness [2002] use data from the PSID to examine the
effect of living in public housing as a child on future earnings and employment. Living
in public housing is instrumented using the residual from a regression of local housing
supply on the demographic characteristics of the area. They find that public housing is
associated with increases in the probability of any employment (from 88 percent to about
95%) and increases in annual earnings (by $1,861 from a mean of $11,210). While all
of these instrumental variables strategies are subject to caveats (is gender composition
really uncorrelated with sibling’s outcomes? Are characteristics of local housing markets
associated with unobserved factors such as the quality of schools that might also affect
child outcomes?) they certainly all point in a similar direction.
An important question is whether public housing assistance benefits children more
than the equivalent cash transfer. It is difficult to answer this question given the available data. However, it is possible to eliminate some possible channels through which
public housing programs might have different effects. One is that public housing programs may constrain the recipient’s choice of neighborhoods, with either positive or
negative effects. Jacob [2004] studies students displaced by demolitions of the most notorious Chicago high-rise projects. The U.S. Congress passed a law in 1996 that required
local housing authorities to destroy units if the cost of renovating and maintaining them
was greater than the cost of providing a voucher for 20 years. Jacobs argues that the order in which doomed buildings were destroyed was approximately random. For example,
in January 1999, the pipes froze in some buildings in the Robert Taylor Homes, which
meant that those buildings were demolished before others in the same complex. By
comparing children who stayed in buildings scheduled to be demolished to others who
had already been displaced by demolitions, he obtains a measure of the effect of living
in high-rise public housing. Despite the fact that the high rises in Jacob’s study were
among the most notorious public housing projects in the country, he finds very little
effect of relocation on children’s educational outcomes. However, this may be because
for the most part, children stayed in the same neighborhoods and in the same schools.
The most exhaustive examination of the effects of giving vouchers to project residents
is an ongoing experiment called “Moving to Opportunity” (MTO). MTO was inspired
by the Gautreaux program in Chicago, which resulted from a consent decree designed
to desegregate Chicago’s public housing by relocating some black inner-city residents

40

to white suburbs. MTO is a large-scale social experiment that is being conducted in
Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Boston and Baltimore (see Orr et al. [2003], Kling
et al. [2005], Sanbonmatsu et al. [2006] ). Between 1994 and 1998, volunteers from
public housing projects were assigned by lottery to one of three groups. The first group
received a voucher that could only be used to rent housing in a low-poverty area (a
Census tract with a poverty rate less than 10 percent). This group also received help
locating a suitable apartment (referred to here as the “MTO group”). The second group
received a voucher which they could use to rent an apartment in any neighborhood.
The third group was the control and received no vouchers or assistance although they
were eligible to remain in their project apartment. Families in the first group did move
to lower poverty neighborhoods and the new neighborhoods of the MTO group were
considerably safer. The move to new neighborhoods had positive effects on the mental
health and schooling attainment of girls, and negative effects on the probability that
they were ever arrested. But surprisingly, MTO either had no effect, or negative effects,
on boys. Boys in the experimental group were 13 percent more likely than controls to
have ever been arrested. This increase was due largely to increases in property crimes.
These boys also report more risky behaviors such as drug and alcohol use. And boys
in the MTO and voucher groups were more likely to suffer injuries. These differences
between boys and girls are apparent even within families [Orr et al., 2003].
It remains to be seen how the long-term outcomes of the MTO children will differ
from controls. Oreopoulos [2003] uses data from Canadian income tax records to examine
the earnings of adults who lived in public housing projects in Toronto as children. There
are large differences between projects in Toronto, both in terms of the density of the
projects, and in terms of the poverty of the neighborhoods. Oreopoulos argues that the
type of project a family lives in is approximately randomly assigned because the family
is offered whatever happens to be available when they get to the top of the waiting
list. Oreopoulos finds that once the characteristics of the family are controlled, the
neighborhood has no effect on future earnings or on the likelihood that someone works.
The findings on near cash programs can be summarized as follows. There is credible
evidence that the FSP may improve birth weight. More work remains to be done to
determine whether it has positive effects on the nutrition of children after birth, whether
similar programs in other countries have positive effects, and whether this particular type
of in kind program has effects that are different than cash subsidies to poor households.
The evidence regarding housing programs also suggests that they can be beneficial to
families, but offers little guidance about the important question of whether housing
programs matter primarily because they subsidize family incomes or operate through

41

some other mechanism. It seems doubtful, given the available evidence, that housing
programs benefit child outcomes primarily by improving their neighborhoods (especially
since many housing projects are located in less desirable neighborhoods).

5.3

Early Intervention Programs

Many programs specifically seek to intervene in the lives of poor children in order to
improve their outcomes. Three interventions that have been shown to be effective are
nurse home visiting programs, nutritional supplementation for pregnant women, and
quality early childhood education programs. Table 9 summarizes some recent evidence
about home visiting programs.
5.3.1

Home Visiting

Unlike many social programs, home visiting has been subject to numerous evaluations
using randomized control trials.
[2009].

A recent survey appears in Howard and Brooks-Gunn

David Olds and collaborators have developed a particular model for home

visiting and conducted randomized controlled trials in a number of settings [Olds et al.,
1999, 2007] to evaluate it.

Olds’ programs focus on families that are at risk because

the mother is young, poor, uneducated and/or unmarried, and involve home visits by
trained public health nurses from the prenatal period up to two years post-partum.
The evaluations have shown many positive effects on maternal behavior, and on child
outcomes. As of two years of age, children in the Elmira New York were much less likely
to have been seen in a hospital emergency room for unintentional injuries or ingestion of
poisonous substances, although this finding was not replicated at other study sites. As
of age 15, children of visited mothers were less likely to have been arrested or to have run
away from home, had fewer sexual partners, and smoked and drank less. The children
were also less likely to have been involved in verified incidents of child maltreatment.
This finding is important given the high incidence of maltreatment among U.S. children
(and especially among poor children), and the negative outcomes of maltreated children
discussed above.

There was little evidence of effects on cognition at four years of

age (except among children of initially heavy smokers), though one might expect the
documented reduction in delinquent behavior among the teens to be associated with
improvements in eventual schooling attainment.
In Olds’ model, using nurses as home visitors is viewed as key to getting good results. This may be because nurse home visitors are more acceptable to parents than
social workers or community workers because families may want medical services.

A

randomized trial of nurses versus trained paraprofessionals [Olds et al., 2002] suggests
42

that the effects that can be obtained by paraprofessionals are smaller. Also, the Olds
programs are strongly targeted at families considered to be at risk and so they do not
shed light on the cost-effectiveness of the universal home visiting programs for pregnant
women and/or newborns that exist in many countries.
Olds’ positive results do not imply that all home visiting programs are equally effective. In fact, Table 9 suggests that the average home visiting program has relatively
small effects.

They often improve parenting in subtle ways and may result in some

improvements in specific health outcomes.

However, these may not be sufficient to

justify the cost of a large scale program (Aos et al. [2004] offers a cost benefit analysis of several programs). Home visiting programs can be viewed as a type of parenting
program—presumably the reason why Old’s home visitors improved outcomes is because
they taught mothers to be better parents. Since parents are so important to children,
programs that seek to improve parenting practices are perennially popular. Yet studies
of these programs suggest that it is remarkably difficult to change parent’s behavior and
that many attempted interventions are unsuccessful.

The most successful parenting

programs are those that combine parent education with some other intervention that
parents want, such as visits by nurses (as in Olds case) or child care [Brooks-Gunn and
Markham, 2005].
5.3.2

U.S. Supplemental Feeding Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)

A second type of early intervention program that has been extensively studied is the
U.S. Supplemental Feeding Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). As its
name implies, WIC is a program targeted at pregnant and lactating women, infants,
and children up to age 5.

Participants receive vouchers that can be redeemed for

particular types of food at participating retailers. Participants must generally go to the
WIC office to receive the vouchers, and generally receive nutrition education services at
that time.

Many WIC offices are run out of clinics and may also facilitate access to

medical care. Dozens of studies, (many of them reviewed in Currie [2003]) have shown
that participation in WIC during pregnancy is associated with longer gestations, higher
birth weights, and generally healthier infants, and that the effects tend to be largest
for children born to the most disadvantaged mothers. Economists have critiqued these
studies, on the grounds that there may be unobservable variables that are correlated with
WIC participation among eligibles and also with better birth outcomes.

Moreover, it

may be implausible to expect WIC to have an effect on preterm birth. A recent Institute
of Medicine report on the subject reviewed the evidence and concluded that randomized
43

trials of many different interventions with women at risk of preterm birth had failed
to find effects (Behrman, 2006). So it might be surprising to find an effect for WIC,
when more specific and intensive interventions aimed at preventing preterm birth have
generally failed.
A number of new studies have attempted to deal with various aspects of this critique,
as shown in Table 10.

Bitler and Currie [2005] look at data from the Pregnancy

Risk Monitoring System, which contains very detailed data from new mothers obtained
by combining data from birth records and survey data taken from women before and
after pregnancy.

They directly address the question of selection bias by examining

the population of mothers eligible for Medicaid (all of whom are adjunctively eligible
for WIC) and asking how participants differ from non-participants along observable
dimensions.

They find that the WIC women are more disadvantaged than the non-

participants along all observables. This finding does not prove that WIC women are also
negatively selected in terms of unobservable variables, but it does mean that women who
were very negatively selected in terms of education, health, family relationships and so
on would have to have other attributes that were systematically correlated with positive
outcomes. Like previous studies, Bitler and Currie also find that WIC participation is
associated with higher maternal weight gain, longer gestation, and higher birth weight,
particularly among women on public assistance, high school dropouts, teen mothers, and
single mothers.
Joyce et al. [2004] adopt a similar strategy with regard to selection, and focus on a
sample of first births to women who initiated prenatal care in the first four months of
pregnancy in order to ensure that participants and non-participants were more likely to
be similar in terms of unobservables.

In their sample of women giving birth in New

York City, they find positive effects of WIC among U.S. born black women, but not
in other groups. Joyce et al. [2007] use a national sample of women, compare women
who enrolled in WIC pre and post delivery, and focus on whether infants are small for
gestational age (SGA). If one does not believe that WIC can affect gestation, then
focusing on SGA is appropriate because it is not affected by gestational age. They find
that the incidence of SGA is lower for the prenatal enrollees than for the post-partum
enrollees. Gueorguieva et al. [2009] use a large sample of births from Florida and try
to deal with potential selection using propensity score matching.

They side step the

issue of whether WIC affects gestation by presenting separate analyses for pregnancies
of different length, and focusing on SGA. They find that longer participation in WIC is
associated with reductions in the incidence of SGA. Kowaleski-Jones and Duncan [2002]
examine sibling pairs from the NLSY and find that WIC participation is associated with

44

an increase of seven ounces in birth weight. However, the number of pairs in which one
child participated and one did not is quite small, so that it would be useful to try to
replicate this finding in a larger sample of siblings.
Figlio et al. [2009] present an innovative instrumental variables strategy using a
large sample of births from Florida that have been merged to school records of older
siblings.

While the characteristics of WIC programs vary across states, they do not

show a lot of variation over time, and previous analyses have demonstrated that these
characteristics are weak instruments [Bitler and Currie, 2005]. Figlio et al. [2009] first try
to select participant and non-participant groups who are very similar. They do this by
defining “marginally ineligible” families as those who participated in the National School
Lunch Program (NLSP) in the year before or after the birth, but did not participate
in the birth year. Thus, the study focuses on families whose incomes hover around the
eligibility threshold for NSLP, which is the same as the eligibility threshold for WIC.
The instrument is a change in income reporting requirements for WIC in Sept. 1999
which made it more difficult for eligible families to receive benefits. Figlio et al. [2009]
find that WIC participation reduces the probability of low birth weight, but find no
significant effect on gestational age or prematurity.
There has been much less study of the effects of WIC on other outcomes, or other
groups of participants. A couple of studies that make some attempt to deal with the
selection issue are summarized in Table 10. One problem with WIC is that it subsidizes
baby formula, which is likely to discourage breast-feeding. Chatterji and Brooks-Gunn
[2004] use the NLSY Mother-Child file and estimate both sibling fixed effects models
and instrumental variables models using characteristics of state programs as instruments.
They find that WIC reduces breast feeding initiation and the length of breastfeeding.
However, these results are subject to the caveats above (i.e. small samples and possibly
weak instruments).

Turning to the effects of WIC on older children, Black et al.

[2004] compare WIC eligible participants and those who did not participate due to
“access problems.” These problems were assessed based on the families own reports
about why they were not participating.

They found that infants who received WIC

were less likely to be underweight, short, or perceived by their parents to be in fair or
poor health. Lee and Mackey-Bilaver [2007] use a large data base from Illinois that
integrates administrative data from several sources. Using sibling fixed effects models,
they find that siblings who received WIC were less likely to be anemic, to have exhibited
failure-to-thrive, or other nutritional deficiencies, and that the infants were less likely
to be abused or neglected. As discussed above, one issue in the interpretation of these
findings is why one infant would receive WIC while the other did not?

45

In one of the most interesting recent studies, Hoynes et al. [2009] use the initial
roll-out of the WIC program in the 1970s to identify its effects.

They find that the

implementation of WIC increased average birth weight by 10 percent and decreased
the fraction of low birth weight births. They did not find any evidence of changes in
fertility.
In summary, the latest group of studies of WIC during pregnancy largely support
the findings of earlier studies which consistently found beneficial effects on infant health.
The finding is remarkable because WIC benefits are relatively modest (often amounting
to about $40 per month) and Americans are generally well fed (if not overfed at least
in terms of total calories). Research that attempted to peer into the “black box” and
shed light on why the program is effective would be extremely interesting.

Another

question that cries out for future research is whether WIC benefits infants and children
(i.e. children who participate after birth)?

While a few studies suggest that it does,

the effects of WIC in this population has been subject to much less scrutiny than the
effects on newborns.
5.3.3

Child Care

There have been many evaluations of early intervention programs delivered through
the provision of child care. One reason for focusing on early intervention through the
provision of quality child care is that the majority of young children are likely to be
placed in some form of care. In 2008, 64% of women with children under 3 worked
for pay (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2009). While the U.S. may be an outlier in
this respect, labor force participation among women with children is high and rising in
many other economies. Blau and Currie [2006] provide an overview of the literature on
early intervention through child care. Many studies concern experimental evaluations
of model programs that serve relatively small numbers of children and involve intensive
services delivered by well-trained and well-supervised staff.

These studies generally

find that early intervention has long-lasting effects on schooling attainment and other
outcomes such as teen pregnancy and crime, even if it does not result in any lasting
increase in cognitive test scores. These results point to the tremendous importance
of “non-cognitive skills” (c.f. Heckman and Rubinstein [2001]) or alternatively, to the
importance of mental as well as physical health in the production of good child outcomes
[Currie and Stabile, 2006].
A few of the most notable model programs are summarized in Table 11. Two studies of “model” early intervention child care programs stand out because they randomly
assigned children to treatment and control group, had low dropout rates, and followed
46

children over many years. They are the Carolina Abecedarian Project and the Perry
Preschool Project. Both found positive effects on schooling. A recent cost-benefit analysis of the Abcedarian data through age 21 found that each dollar spent on Abecedarian
saved tax payers four dollars. And by focusing only on cost savings, this calculation does
not even include the value of higher achievement to the individual children and society
[Masse and Barnett, 2002]. Each dollar spent on Perry Preschool has been estimated
to have saved up to seven dollars in social costs [Karoly et al., 1998], although this high
benefit-cost ratio is driven largely by the effect of the intervention on crime, which in
turn depends on a handful of individuals.
Anderson [2008] conducts a re-analysis of the Perry Preschool and Abcedarian data
(and the Early Training Project) and finds that as in the MTO experiment, the effects
of intervention were largely concentrated among girls. In addition to analysing the data
by gender, Anderson focuses most of his attention on a summary index of effects, in
order to avoid understating the importance of null results. Anderson study highlights
an interesting question, which is why effects might be different for boys and girls?
In a reanalysis of the Perry data, Heckman et al. [2010] argue that Anderson’s summary index is not meaningful, and that an important result of Perry is that there were
substantial negative effects on crime among males. Moreover, Heckman et al. note that
the randomization in Perry was imperfect, and that accounting for this imperfection
yields stronger results. They conclude that rates of return are 7 to 10% for males and
females, which are smaller than other estimates that have been reported, but economically significant.
The fact that special interventions like Perry Preschool or Abcedarian had an effect
on at least some target children, does not prove that the types of programs typically
available to poor inner-city children will do so.

Head Start is a preschool program

for disadvantaged 3, 4, and 5 year olds which currently serves about 800,000 children
each year. It is funded as a federal-local matching grant program and over time, federal
funding has increased from $96 million when the program began in 1965 about $7 billion
in 2009 (plus additional “stimulus” funds). Head Start is not of the same quality as the
model interventions, and the quality varies from center to center. But Head Start centers
have historically been of higher average quality than other preschool programs available
to low income people. This is because, in contrast to the private child care market,
there are few very low-quality Head Start programs (see Blau and Currie [2006] for an
overview of preschool quality issues).
An experimental evaluation of Head Start has recently been conducted [Puma et al.,
2010]. The evaluation compares Head Start children to peers who may or may not be

47

in some other form of preschool (including state-funded preschools modelled in Head
Start).

In fact, the majority of children who did not attend Head Start did end up

attending some other preschool program. Even relative to this baseline, initial results
show that Head Start children make gains, particularly in terms of language ability. But
children are followed only into the first grade, and so this evaluation did not address the
important issue of whether Head Start has longer term effects. This example illustrates
one of the limitations of experiments for the study of longer-term effects, which is that
one may have to wait a long time for evidence to accumulate. There has also been a
federal evaluation of Early Head Start (EHS), a version of the program geared to infants
and toddlers under three years old. As Table 11 shows, EHS has small positive effects on
cognitive test scores and some measures of behavior though Aos et al. [2004] concludes
that it does not pass a cost-benefit test.
Table 12 summarizes notable non-experimental evaluations of Head Start and other
public preschool programs.

In a series of studies Currie and Thomas use national

publicly-available survey data to try to measure the effect of Head Start. In most of
these studies, they compare the outcomes of children who attended Head Start to siblings
who did not attend. As discussed above, sibling fixed effects control for many shared
characteristics of children, but are not a panacea.

However, careful examination of

differences between participant and non-participant children within families suggested
that the Head Start sibling typically attends when the family is relatively disadvantaged.
For example, a young single mother might have her first child attend Head Start.

If

she then marries, her next child will enjoy higher income and be ineligible for Head
Start. Currie and Thomas found no within-family differences in birth weight or other
individual characteristics of the children. They also investigated spillover effects, which
as discussed above, can bias the estimated effect of Head Start.

They found some

evidence [Garces et al., 2002] that having an older sibling attend Head Start had positive
effects on younger siblings.

In all, it seems likely that sibling fixed effects models

understate the true effect of Head Start.
Nevertheless, they found significant positive effects of Head Start on educational
attainments among white youths, and reductions in the probabilities of being booked
or charged with a crime among black youths [Garces et al., 2002]. Test score gains
for blacks and whites were initially the same, but these gains tended to fade out more
quickly for black than white students, perhaps because black former Head Start students
typically attend worse schools than other students [Currie and Thomas, 1995]. Effects
were especially large for Hispanic children [Garces et al., 2002].
More recently, Deming [2009] replicates the results of Currie and Thomas [1995]
48

using the same cohort of NLSY children observed at older ages.

Like Anderson, he

focuses on an index of outcomes (although he also reports results for separate outcomes)
and finds that Head Start results in an increase of .23 standard deviations, which is
equivalent to about 1/3 of the gap between Head Start and other children. He notes that
projected gains in earnings are enough to offset the cost of the program, so that there is a
positive cost/benefit ratio. Carneiro and Ginja [2008] use the same data but a different
identification strategy: they focus on families around the cutoff for income eligibility for
the program and compare families who are just below (and therefore eligible) to those
who are just above (and therefore ineligible). A potential problem with this strategy
is that it implicitly assumes that families cannot game the system by reducing their
incomes in order to become eligible for the program.

Consistent with other studies,

they find positive effects of Head Start attendance on adolescents including reductions
in behavior problems, grade repetition, depression, and obesity.
Since its inception, Head Start has aimed to improve a broad range of child outcomes
(not only test scores). When the program was launched in 1965, the Office of Economic
Opportunity assisted the 300 poorest counties in applying for Head Start funds, and
these counties were significantly more likely than other counties to receive funds. Using
a regression discontinuity design, Ludwig and Miller [2007] show that mortality from
causes likely to be affected by Head Start fell among children 5 to 9 in the assisted
counties relative to the others. Mortality did not fall in slightly older cohorts who would
not have been affected by the introduction of the program.
Frisvold [2006] and Frisvold and Lumeng [2009] also focus on health effects by examining the effect of Head Start on obesity. The former instruments Head Start attendance
using the number of Head Start places available in the community, while the later takes
advantage of a cut in a Michigan Head Start program which resulted in the conversion
of a number of full-day Head Start places to half day places. Both studies find large
and significant effects of Head Start on the incidence of obesity. In defense of their estimates, which some might find implausibly large, Frisvold and Lumeng point out that
a reduction of only 75 calories per day (i.e. less than a slice of bread or an apple) would
be sufficient to yield their results.

In small children, even small changes in diet may

have large cumulative effects. Anderson et al. [2009] follow Garces et al. and use sibling
fixed effects and data from the PSID to estimate the effect of Head Start on smoking as
an adult. Again, they find large effects.
Head Start has served as a model for state preschools targeted to low-income children
in states such as California, and also for new (non-compulsory) universal preschool programs in Georgia, and Oklahoma. The best available evaluations of universal preschool

49

programs highlight the importance of providing a high quality program that is utilized
by the neediest children. Baker, Gruber, and Milligan [2008] examine the introduction
of a universal, $5 per day (later $7), preschool program in the Canadian province of Quebec. The authors find a strong response to the subsidy in terms of maternal labor supply
and the likelihood of using care, but they find negative effects on children for a range of
outcomes. Lefebvre et al. [2006] focus on the same natural experiment and examine the
effects on children’s vocabulary scores, which have been shown to be a good predictor
of schooling attainment in early grades. They find strong evidence of negative effects.
In interpreting this study, it is important to consider who was affected by the program.
Because poor children were already eligible for child care subsidies, the marginal child
affected by this program was a child who probably would have stayed home with his or
her middle-class, married, mother, and instead was put into child care. Moreover, the
marginal child care slot made available by the program was of low quality—the sudden
influx of children into care caused the province to place more emphasis on making slots
available than on regulating their quality. Hence, the study should be viewed as the
consequence of moving middle class children from home care to relatively poor quality
care. It is not possible to draw any conclusion from this study about the effect of drawing poor children into care of good quality, which is what model preschool programs and
Head Start aim to do.
Gormley and Gayer [2006] examine the effects of Oklahoma’s universal pre-K program which is run through the public schools and is thought to be of high quality. They
take advantage of strict age cutoffs for the program and compare children who had just
attended for a year to similar children who were ineligible to attend because they were
slightly younger. They find a 52 percent gain in pre-reading skills, a 27 percent gain
in pre-writing skills, and a 21 percent gain in pre-math skills. These results suggest
that a high quality universal pre-K program might well have positive effects, though one
would have to track children longer to determine whether these initial gains translate
into longer term gains in schooling attainment. Several other recent studies use a similar regression discontinuity design including Hustedt et al. [2008] and Wong et al. [2008]
who examine state pre-K programs in five states. These studies find uniformly positive
effects. It has been argued in fact, that the effects of quality state preschool programs
are larger than those of Head Start. However, it is difficult to control for pre-existing
differences between the Head Start children and children who attend other preschools.
For example in Magnuson et al. [2007], the preschool children had systematically higher
incomes than those who attended Head Start.
A handful of studies examine the long-term effects of public pre-school or Kinder-

50

garten programs. Cascio [2009] uses data from four decennial censuses to analyze the
impact of introducing Kindergarten into public schools in the U.S., where Kindergarten
was phased in on a state-by-state basis.

Using a cohort-based design, she finds that

white children born in adopting states after the reform were less likely to dropout of
highschool and less likely to be institutionalized as adults. However, she finds no significant effect for blacks, which may be due to significant crowd out of blacks from other
programs, such as Head Start.
for girls.

Like Anderson, she finds that the effects were larger

Havnes and Mogstad [2009] study a 1975 policy change in Norway which

increased the availability of regulated child care in some areas but not in others. They
find that children ”exposed” to more child care received more education and were more
likely to have earnings as adults.

Once again, much of the benefit was concentrated

among females, and children of less educated mothers were particularly likely to benefit.
In terms of mechanisms, they find that the increase in formal care largely displaced
informal care, without much net effect on the mother’s labor force participation.
Finally, it is worth mentioning the “Sure Start” program in England and Wales. This
program aimed to provide early intervention services in disadvantaged neighborhoods but
allowed a wide variety of program models, which obviously complicates an assessment
of the program.

An evaluation was conducted by comparing communities that were

early adopters to those that adopted later. A second evaluation compared Sure Start
children to children from similar neighborhoods who were drawn from the Millenium
Cohort study. This second study used propensity scores to balance the samples. The
first evaluation found that the most disadvantaged households were actually doing more
poorly in intervention areas than in other areas (NESS, 2005), while the second found
some evidence of positive effects (NESS, 2008).

Following the first evaluation, there

has been a move to standardize the intervention and most communities are now offering
Sure Start Children’s Centers.

This latest incarnation of the program remains to be

evaluated.
This discussion shows the value of using a framework for the production of child
quality as a lens for the interpretation of the program evaluation literature. As discussed
above, child human capital is produced using inputs that may come from either the
family or from other sources. A program that augments the resources available to the
child is likely to have positive effects (subject of course to diminishing returns), while a
program that reduces the resources available to the child is likely to have negative effects.
Hence, a program that causes poor quality group time to be substituted for relatively
high quality maternal time can have a negative effect and vice versa. The important
point is that it is possible to intervene effectively and to improve the trajectories of

51

young children.
5.3.4

Health Insurance

Health insurance is not an intervention program in the sense of the programs described
above. Yet, there is a good deal of evidence that access to health insurance improves
children’s health at birth and afterwards.

Much of the evidence comes from studies

of the introduction, or expansion, of health insurance benefits. Some of this literature
is summarized in Table 13. For example, Hanratty [1996] examined the introduction
of public health insurance in Canada, which was phased in on a province-by-province
basis. Using county-level panel data, she finds that the introduction of health insurance
was associated with a decline of four percent in the infant mortality rate, and that the
incidence of low birth weight also decreased by 1.3% for all parents and by 8.9% for single
parents. Currie and Gruber [1996a] conduct a similar exercise for the U.S., focusing on
an expansion of public health insurance to pregnant women and infants.

They find

that the effects vary depending on whether the expansion covered the poorest women, or
women somewhat higher in the income distribution. Narrowly targeted expansions that
increased the fraction of the poorest women eligible by 30%, reduced low birth weight
by 7.8%, and reduced infant mortality by 11.5%. Expansions of eligibility of a similar
magnitude to women of higher incomes had very small effects on the incidence of low
birth weight, but reduced infant mortality. This result suggests that among women of
somewhat higher income levels, the expansions did not improve health at birth, but may
have increased access to life-saving technologies after birth. Currie and Grogger [2002]
focus on bureaucratic obstacles to obtaining health insurance by looking at contractions
of welfare (women cut from the rolls lost automatic eligibility for Medicaid) as well as
outreach measures undertaken by different states. They find that changes that reduced
barriers to enrollment increased use of prenatal care and had positive effects on infant
health outcomes.
Baldwin et al. [1998] use individual-level data and compare expansions in Washington, which included enhanced prenatal care services, to expansions in Colorado which
did not in a difference-in-differences design. They find reductions in low birth weight
among medically high risk infants in Washington.

Dubay et al. [2001] conduct a

difference-in-difference investigation comparing the outcomes of high and low socioeconomic status women in the 1980-1986 period and in the 1986 to 1993 period.

They

find overall improvements in the use of prenatal care for low SES women, but find improvements in birth weight only for some groups of white women. However, this design
52

does not really focus on health insurance per se, since the estimates will be affected by
any other changes in health care markets between the two periods that had differential
effects by SES.
Studies of the effects of health insurance expansions on children often examine preventable hospitalizations (also called ambulatory care sensitive hospitalizations). The
idea is that certain conditions, such as childhood asthma, should not result in hospitalizations if they are properly treated on an outpatient basis. Hence, hospitalizations for
these conditions are inefficient and indicate that children are receiving inadequate preventive care. Kaestner et al. [2001] use a difference-in-differences design comparing low
income and other children before and after Medicaid expansions. They find reductions
in preventable hospitalizations of 10 to 20 percent.
Aizer [2003] examines a California outreach program that increased child enrollments
into Medicaid. She finds that an increase in enrollments of 1,000 reduces hospitalizations by 3.26. Dafny and Gruber [2005] use a design similar to Currie and Gruber in
which actual individual eligibility is instrumented using a “simulated eligibility measure”
which is an index of the generosity of the Medicaid program in the state. The reason for
adopting instrumental variables estimation is that eligibility for Medicaid is determined
by endogenous variables such as parental labor supply. They find that Medicaid eligibility increased hospitalizations overall. However, there was no statistically significant
increase in avoidable hospitalizations, suggesting that the increase was mainly due to
children with unavoidable conditions gaining greater access to care. They also found
increases in the probability of receiving a procedure and reductions in length of stay,
suggesting that children who were hospitalized were receiving more aggressive care and
that it may have improved their outcomes.
One difficulty with studying child health is that health today is affected by past
investments, including health insurance at younger ages. Janet Currie [2008] therefore
compare the health effects of contemporaneous eligibility for health insurance among
older children to the effect of having been eligible since birth. They find that contemporaneous health insurance coverage has little effect on health status but that eligibility
from birth is protective.

Levine and Schanzenbach [2009] link health insurance eligi-

bility at birth to 4th and 8th grade scores on the National Assessment of Educational
Progress. They find that a 50 percentage point increase in eligibility at birth is associated with a small but significant gain on reading scores at both grades, though there is
no effect on math scores. A difficulty with both studies is that neither income at birth
nor state of birth are directly observed in the cross sectional data sets that they use, so
they must be imputed using current income and state of birth.

53

Another area of research focuses on the quality of care provided by public health
insurance programs.

Analysis of this issue is complicated by the possibility that ex-

pansions of public insurance cause people to lose private health insurance coverage, a
phenomena dubbed “crowdout” (Cutler and Gruber, 1996; Dubay and Kenney, 1997;
Card and Shore-Shepard, 2004; Gruber and Simon, 2008). If the private insurance that
is lost (or dropped) in response to expansions of public insurance is of superior quality
to the private insurance, than people’s health may suffer. Koch [2009] concludes that
recent expansions of public health insurance to children at higher income levels have
reduced access to doctor’s office visits and increased reliance on emergency rooms. He
also shows some evidence consistent with the idea that this is because children are being
crowded out of superior (but obviously more expensive) coverage from private heath
insurance plans. In fact, it is quite possible that crowding out has increased over time
as the public has become familiar with public health insurance plans for children and
private health insurance costs have continued to escalate.
Medicaid managed care has also been shown (in at least some cases) to reduce the
quality of care. Christopher J. Conover [2001] conduct a difference-in-difference analysis of Tennessee and North Carolina before and after Tennessee switched its Medicaid
patients to managed care. They find that use of prenatal care and birth outcomes deteriorated in Tennessee after the switch. Aizer et al. [2007] examine data from California,
where Medicaid managed care was adopted on a county-by-county basis. They also find
that compulsory managed care had a negative impact on use of prenatal care and birth
outcomes. This may be because the California Medicaid managed care program “carved
out” care for sick newborns–that is, they were covered by a state fund rather than by
the managed care companies so that companies had little incentive to take actions to
improve newborn health.
In summary, health insurance matters for children’s outcomes. But quality of care
also matters. And it is important to remember that for most children threats to health
and well being come from sources such as injuries, poor nutrition, and toxins rather than
only from lack of access to medical care.

Discussion and Conclusions

There has been an explosion of research into the early determinants of human capital
development over the past 10 years.

The work surveyed in this chapter conclusively

shows that events before five years old can have large long term impacts on adult outcomes. It is striking that child and family characteristics measured at school entry do
54

as much to explain future outcomes as factors that labor economists have more traditionally focused on, such as years of education. Yet evidence for long term effects of
early insults should not be a cause of pessimism. While children can be permanently
damaged at this age, the damage can be remediated. The picture that emerges is one
of vulnerability but also of resilience.
Since early childhood is a new area of research for economists, there remain many
unanswered questions. One major question implicit in the structure of this chapter is
whether it will ever be possible to estimate human capital production functions. The
opening sections of this chapter showed that the production function paradigm provides an extremely useful way of thinking about the problem, and in particular, that
it highlights the importance of actions taken by parents and others in exacerbating or
mitigating the effects of random shocks.

However, to actually estimate the implied

production functions would place huge demands on the data, demands that are unlikely
to be met in practice.15 Hence, the evidence we have surveyed is largely reduced form.
A second major question is whether shocks at certain key ages matter more than
others?

Much has been written about “critical periods.” The idea is that certain

functionalities must be acquired at a particular point in life, and if they are not acquired
at that point, they will either not be acquired at all, or will not be acquired properly
There is to date little hard evidence of critical periods in humans. However, the evidence
discussed above certainly suggests that the period while children are in utero is one of
the most important to their later development. This has important implications for the
timing of social interventions designed to mitigate harms – it may be that interventions
should be targeted at pregnant women and/or women of child bearing age in addition
to young children. But there is insufficient evidence at present to be able to say that
insults or interventions at for example zero to one are likely to be more effective than
interventions at age three or four. Moreover, the cohort designs used to establish the
importance of the fetal period can tell us more about the comparison between the fetal
period and the early post natal period than they do about the comparison between the
fetal period and say exposures at age five.
A related question is whether some types of shocks matter more than others? This
chapter surveyed many different types of shocks including exposure to disease, inadequate nutrition, exposure to pollution, injuries, maternal mental health problems, maternal smoking, and maltreatment. However, given that studies of the effects of these
shocks rely on different populations, time periods, and methods, it is difficult to get any
sense of whether one type of shock is more of a threat to human capital development
15

See however Appendix D for one thought about how a production function might be estimated.

55

than any other. Similarly, while it is clear that shocks to health have longterm effects
on domains such as education and earnings, it is not clear whether health shocks have
direct effects on cognition or learning, or whether they act mainly by affecting future
health.
Several studies we reviewed suggested that both shocks and interventions can have
different long-term effects on males and females. But these findings are too new for us
to be able to predict when this difference will occur, and we have virtually no evidence
about why it occurs

One possibility is that gender differences are biological.

For

example, boys may be less robust than girls so that the same health shock can “cull”
boys while girls survive (e.g., see Kraemer [2000], Almond and Mazumder [2008]). In
this case, average health of male survivors might be better than that of female survivors.
Alternatively, gender differences could reflect differential parental or societal responses
to shocks inspired by son preferences or by beliefs about biological gender differences.16
Finally, given all of this evidence of long term effects of early life outcomes, what is the
least cost way to intervene to improve outcomes? This is still an open question and our
knowledge of the types of programs that are effective (and why) is evolving rapidly. For
example, until recently, there was little evidence that income transfers had much effect,
so it was easy to surmize that in-kind programs were a more effective way to improve
child outcomes. Recent evidence that cash transfers are indeed effective should cause
a re-evaluation of the received wisdom on this point, given the inefficiencies involved
in providing transfers in-kind. Similarly, the large literature about negative effects of
maternal employment in the early years is thrown into question by recent studies showing
that large changes in maternity leave policies affected maternal employment without
having any detectable impact on long-term child outcomes. This rapid development in
our knowledge makes the study of human capital development before five an exciting
frontier for research in labor economics.

16

For example, advances in ultrasound technology could have changed the average human capital
endowments of boys and girls by allowing parents who prefer sons to invest differentially prenatally
(and not only by allowing them to abort female fetuses). See Lhila and Simon [2008] for recent work
on this topic.

We consider three cases for the substitutability of period 1 and period 2 investments
(as captured by φ):
1. Good Substitutability Between Periods 1 and 2 When φ > 0, the optimal I2a
moves in the opposite direction from µg and parents should compensate a negative
shock to child a by reducing second period investments in child b. Intuitively, it
is easier to substitute though the production function for human capital than it is
through the Cobb-Douglas utility function.
2. Cobb-Douglas Substitutability Between Periods 1 and 2 For φ = 0, the
elasticity of substitution between periods is the same as the elasticity of substitution in preferences between the children (both Cobb-Douglas). Here, there is no
δI ∗
winning investment response to the shock to child a, i.e. δµ2a = 0, so period 2
g
investments should be left unchanged.
3. Poor Substitutability Between Periods 1 and 2 For φ < 0, it is difficult to
repair damage from a negative µg shock in the second period, so the return to
period 2 investments in sibling a is below that for sibling b. Therefore, parents
should reinforce the first peirod shock by allocating second period investments
away from sibling a.
Importantly, the direction of these investment responses did not depend on α, the
relative weight parents place in their utility function on the human capital of child a
versus child b. Favoring the human capital formation of a particular child – even the
child that experiences the negative endowment shock – does not affect the direction of
the optimal investment response. Nor do differences in the “overall” productivity of the
child, i.e. efficiency parameter A 6= B in equations (17) and (18), alter the direction
of the optimal investment response to µg . Thus, empirical evidence suggesting either
reinforcing or compensating investments within the family does not reveal information
on parental preferences absent additional information on the production function for
human capital.

Appendix D
In general, we need to observe the baseline investments I¯1 and I¯2 to estimate parameters
of the production function φ and γ. However, nearly all datasets with measures of
human capital h and an observable investment shock µg lack measures of human capital
investments I¯1 and I¯2 . We can still make progress in estimating parameters of the
production function despite not observing I¯1 and I¯2 , so long as we expect baseline
investment levels to be similar: I¯1 ∼
= I¯2 . For µg = µg 0 ,17 equation (4) reduces to:
1−γ
.
γ

(29)

The assumption that µg = µg 0 simplifies the algebra, but φ and γ can still be estimated for µg 6= µg 0
so long as µg and µg 0 are observed. We thank Christine Pal for pointing this out.

62

0

That is, we can observe damage to h from the shock µg in second period investments
relative to the damage from the first period shock µg , which isolates γ (while remaining
silent on the magnitude of φ).
With an estimate of γ in hand, we can then estimate φ by using the total derivative
in investment shocks, i.e. how human capital changes as we change both first and second
period investments (by an equal amount). In an overlapping generations framework,
this would require a shock lasting two childhood periods (or longer), and “half-exposed”
cohorts on either end of the shock. Damage to the fully exposed cohort relative to the
cohort exposed in period 1 alone is:

Notes: Standard errors clustered on the mother are shown in in brackets with sample sizes below. Twin pairs in
which a child had a congenital anomaly are omitted. Birth weight measured in kilograms. Each entry is from a
separate regression of the dependent variable on birth weight and a mother fixed effect. Models in column 1 also
control for child gender. Sample sizes are rounded to the nearest multiple of 50.

Given a true population effect size, what is the power of a size alpha = .05 test
against the null hypothesis that there is no effect for different sample sizes?
Basis Study
Black, Devereux, and
Salvanes (2007)

Assumptions
True model:
Prob(HSGRAD) = 0.7 + 0.1*ln(birthweight) + error

Key result: a 1% increase
in birth weight increases
the probabililty of high
school completion by
0.09 percentage points.

Calculation of error variance and SD:
Let y = Prob(HSGRAD), x = ln(birthweight), e = error
Var(y) = 0.44^2 = 0.19
Var(x) = 0.26^2 = 0.07 (where SD(x)=0.26, according
to the distribution of ln(birthweight))
If y = 0.7 + 0.1x + e, and x and e are independent,
Var(e) = Var(y) - (0.1^2)*Var(x)
= 0.19-(0.1^2)*(0.07) = 0.19

Twin fixed effects estimates compared to OLS. To explore
generalizability of findings from twins sample, weighted
the sample using the U.S. singleton distribution of fetal
growth rates.

Results from twins sample:
1 oz. per week of pregnancy increase in fetal growth leads to increases of 5%,
in schooling attainment; 2% in height; 8% hourly wages.
Results from twins sample weighted using singleton distribution:
1 oz. per week of pregnancy increase in fetal growth leads to increase of 5% in
schooling attainment; 1.7% in height; no significant effect on wages.
OLS underestimates effects of birth weight by 50%.

Twin fixed effects to estimate effect of low birth weight
(LBW) on hospital costs, health at birth, and infant
mortality. Also estimated impact of maternal smoking
during pregnancy on health among singleton births,
controlling for numerous background and demographic
characteristics using OLS and propensity score matching.

Results using twin fixed effects:
1 SD increase in birth weight leads to:
0.08 SD decrease in hospital costs for delivery and initial care
0.03 SD decrease in infant mortality rates
0.03 SD increase in Apgar scores
0.01 SD decrease in use of assisted ventilator after birth
(OLS estimates w/out twin fixed effects are 0.51 SD, 0.41 SD, 0.51 SD, 0.25
SD). Results from OLS on effects of maternal smoking:
Maternal smoking reduces birth weight by 200g (6%); increases likelihood that
infant is LBW (<2500g) by more than 100% (mean=.061)
No statistically significant effects on Apgar score, infant mortality rates, or use
of assisted ventilator at birth.

Estimated effects of in utero influenza exposure by
comparing cohorts born immeditely before, during, and
after the 1918 pandemic and by employing the
idiosyncratic geographic variation in intensity of
exposure to conduct within- cohort analysis. Exposed
cohort = those born in 1919. Surrounding cohorts = those
born in 1918 and 1920. Used multivarate regression with
dummy for birth cohort = 1919, and a quadratic cohort
trend to measure departures in the 1919 birth cohort
outcomes from the trend. For geographic comparison,
used data on virus strength by week as well as data on
epidemic timing by census division to yield a measure of
average pandemic virulence by division. Then estimated
multivariate regression including the virulence measure,
state and year of birth fixed effects, the infant mortality
rate in state and year of birth, and the attrition of birth
cohort in the census data.

Estimation results comparing birth cohorts:
The 1919 birth cohort, compared with the cohort trend:
was 4-5% (13-15% among treated) less likely to complete high school
received 0.6-1.6% fewer years of education
had 1-3% less total income (for males only, 2005 dollars)
had 1-2% lower socioeconomic status index (Duncan index)
was 1-2% more likely to have a disability that limits work (for males only)
had 12% higher average welfare payment (for women)
Estimates are slightly larger for nonwhite subgroup.
Estimation results using geographic variation and state fixed effects: (For
the 1919 birth cohort, used average maternal infection rate = 1/3)
Maternal infection:
reduces schooling by 2.2%
reduces probability of high school graduation by 0.05%
decreases annual income by 6%
reduces socioeconomic status index by 2-3%

Mother's low birth weight increases likelihood that child is low birth weight by
about 50%. The incidence of child low birth weight is 7% higher if mother was
born into high poverty zip code than into low poverty zip code.
Children born into poor households are 0.7% more likely to be low birth
weight if their mothers were low birth weight; children born into nonpoor
households are .0.4% more likely to be low birth weight if their mothers were
low birth weight (so, poverty raises the probability of transmission of low birth
weight by 88%).
Being low birth weight is associated with a loss of $110 in future income, on
average, on a baseline income of $10,096 (in 1970 dollars). Being low birth
weight increases the probability of living in a high-poverty neighborhood by
3% relative to the baseline.
Being low birth weight reduces future educational attainment by 0.1 years.

Effects on infant mortality: increase infant morality.
E.g. in Sibling Sample (infant mortality = 0.011)
Apgar score <6 increases probability of infant mortality by 31.9 pp
BW<1000g increases probability of infant mortality by 87.2 pp
gestation<36 weeks increases probability of infant mortality by 11.9 pp
Effect on Language Arts score (taken in grade 12):
Apgar score <6 decreases test score by 0.1 of SD (sig. at 10% level)
BW 2501-3000g decreases test score by 0.04 of SD
Effect on probability of reaching grade 12 by age 17:
Apgar score <6 decreases grade 12 probability by 4.1 pp (sig. at 10%)
BW 1001-1500g decreases grade 12 probability by 14.1 pp
gestation<36 weeks decreases grade 12 probability by 4.0 pp
Effect on social assistance take-up during ages 18-21.25:

Regression of test scores on year, age, and subject fixed
effects (separately for blacks and whites) using NAEPLTT and AFQT test score data. In AFQT test score data,
correct for selection bias using inverse probability
weighting from Natality and Census data. Estimated
regressions separately for blacks and whites and for the
North, the South, the Rustbelt, the deep South, and
individual states within the South and North. Also
estimated difference-in-difference-in-difference (DDD)
models, comparing black and white test scores between
cohorts born in 1960-62 and 1970-72 in the South relative
to the Rustbelt, controlling for region-specific, racespecific age-by-time effects and race-by-region-by-time
effects. Used post neonatal mortality rate (PNMR) as a
proxy for infant health environment to assess impact of
infant health on the test score gap.

NAEP-LTT data:
The black-white test score gap declined from 1 SD to 0.6 of SD between 1971
and 2004. The convergence was primarily due to large increases in black test
scores in the 1980s. Regression results indicate that the convergence was due
to cohort effects, rather than time effects.
AFQT data:
The black-white gap in AFQT test scores declined by about 19% between the
1962-63 and 1972 birth cohorts.
The decline in the gap is about 0.3SDs greater in the South relative to the
Rustbelt between 1960-62 and 1970-72 cohorts.
Convergence in PNMR explains 52% of the variation across states in AFQT
convergence.
Effects of access to hospitals:
A 30pp increase in black hospital birth rates from 1962-64 to 1968-70
increases cohort AFQT scores by 7.5 percentile points.
A black child who gained admission to a hospital before age 4 had a 0.7-1 SD
gain in AFQT score at age 17-18 relative to a black child who did not.

Results from nonparametric regression:
Residual life expectancy at age 50 is 3.1 years shorter for exposed men than for
men born after the famine; 1.4 years shorter than for men born before famine.
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test suggests that the survival curves after age 50 differ

Results from parametric survival models:
Exposure to famine at birth for men reduces residual life expectancy at age 50
by 4.2 years. No statistically significant results for women.

(Currie and Neidell (2005)). Data
on pollution from California EPA.
Individual-level infant mortality
data from California vital statistics
1989-2000. n=206,353.

1.1 unit reduction in postnatal exposure to CO (the actual reduction that
occurred in CA in the 1990s) saved 991 infant lives - 4.6% decrease in infant
mortality rate. No statistically significant effects of prenatal exposure to any of
the pollutants.

Estimated linear models that approximate hazard models,
where the risk of death is defined over weeks of life, and
length of life is controlled for with a flexible
nonparametric spline. Controlled for prenatal and
postnatal pollution exposure, weather, child's age, and
numerous other child and family characteristics, as well
as month, year, and zip code fixed effects. Examined
effects of ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), and
particulate matter (PM10) on infant mortality.

Prenatal exposure to radioactive
fallout (from Chernobyl) and
school outcomes in Sweden
(Almond, Edlund, and Palme
(2007)). All Swedes born 19831988, n=562,637. Data on
radiation from Swedish Geological
Survey at parish level.

Three empirical strategies:
1) Cohort comparisons - Compared cohorts in utero
before, during, and after Chernobyl with particular focus
on cohort 8-25 weekspost conception.
2) Within-cohort comparisons- Use geographic variation
in levelsof exposure. Define 4 regions, R0 (least
exposure), R1, R2, R3.
3) Diff-in-diff sibling comparison -Compared those
exposed to radiation in utero 8-25 to siblings who were
not.

Results from 1):
Probability of qualifying for high school reduced by 0.2% for cohort in utero
during radiation; by 0.6% for cohort in utero 8-25
Grades reduced by 0.4% for cohort in utero during radiation;by 0.6% for
cohort in utero 8-25.
Results from 2): (R3 relative to R0)
Probability of qualifying for high school reduced by 3.6% for cohort in utero
during radiation in R3; by 4% for cohort in utero 8-25 in R3.
Grades reduced by 3% for cohort in utero during radiation in R3; by 5.2% for
cohort in utero 8-25 in R3.

Air Pollution and Infant Health:
Lessons from New Jersey
(Currie, Neidell, and Schmieder
(2009)). Pollution data from EPA.
Individual-level data on infant
births and deaths from the New
Jersey Department of Health 19892003. n=283,393 for mother fixed
effects models.

Mother fixed effects to estimate impact of exposure to
pollution (during and after birth) on infant health
outcomes.Air pollution measured from air quality
monitors and assigned to each childbased on home
address of mother. Also included interactions b/n variable
for pollution exposure and maternal smoking as well as
other maternal characteristics. Controlled for weather,
pollution monitor locations, time trends, seasonal effects,
and other background characteristics.

1 unit change in mean CO exposure during last trimester ofpregnancy
decreases average birth weight by 0.5%, increases likelihood of low birth
weight by 8%, and decreases gestation by 0.2%.
1 unit change in mean CO exposure in first 2 weeks after birth increases
likelihood of infant mortality by 2.5%.
Estimated that a 1 unit decrease in mean CO exposure in first 2 weeks after
birth would save 17.6 per 100,000 lives.
Effects of CO exposure on infant health at birth are 2-6 times larger for
smokers and mothers who are over age 35. Effects of PM10 (particulate
matter) and ozone are not consistently significant across the specifications.

(Currie and Schmieder (2009)).
Toxic Release Inventory data at

Multivariate regression of infant health outcomes on
amount of toxic releases in each county and year,
controlling for demographic and socio-economic
characteristics, mother drinking or smoking during
pregnancy, county employment, and county and year fixed
effects. Compared effects of developmental toxins to other
toxins, and "fugitive" air releases to "stack" air releases
(since emissions that go up a smoke stack are more likely
to be treated in some way, and hence will affect those in

An additional thousand pounds per square mile of all toxic releases leads to:
0.02% decrease in length of gestation
0.04% decrease in birth weight
0.1% increase in probability of low birth weight
0.8% increase in probability of very low birth weight
1.3% increase in infant mortality
Larger effects for developmental toxins and for fugitive air releases than for
other toxins or for stack air releases.
A 2-SD increase in lead releases decreases gestation by 0.02% and decreases
birth weight by 0.05%. A 2-SD increase in cadmium releases decreases
gestation by 0.03%, decreases birth weight by 0.07%, increases probability of
low birth weight by 1.2%, increases probability of very low birth weight by
1.4%, and increases infant mortality by 5%. Similar results for toluene,
epichlorohydrin.
Reductions in releases over 1988-1999 can account for 3.9% of the reduction
in infant mortality over the same time period.

regressions for contemporaneous effects,
geographic units are state economic areas.
In regressions for long-term effects,
geographic units are states of birth.

Results
1 unit change in hyperactivity score:
increases probability of grade retention by 10-12% in both US and Canada
decreases math scores by 0.04-0.07 SD in both US and Canada
increases probability of being in special ed by 11% in US
decreases reading scores by 0.05 SD in US
1 unit change in conduct disorder score (in the US only):
increases probability of grade retention by 10%
decreases math scores by 0.02 SD
decreases reading scores by 0.03 SD
1 unit change in aggression score (in Canada only)
decreases probability that a youth aged 16-19 is in school by 4%
High depression scores increase probability of grade retention by 10% in both US
and Canada.
No significant effects of interaction between mental health scores and income or
maternal education.
Contemporaneous Effects of Infections on Children:
1 SD increase in lagged hookworm infection associated with:
0.18-0.25 SD decrease in school enrollment.
0.21-0.28 SD decrease in full-time school enrollment
0.1 SD decrease in literacy
Results robust to inclusion of state-year fixed effects, controlling for meanreversion in schooling, and using state-level infection rates. Larger effects for
blacks than for whites. No contemporaneous effects on adults.
Long-Term Effects of Infections in Childhood on Adults:
Being infected with hookworm in one's childhood leads to a reduction in wages of
43% and a decrease in returns to schooling by 5%. 80% reduction in wages due to
hookworm infections explained by reduced returns to schooling. Being infected
with hookworm in one's childhood leads to a reduction in occupational income
score by 23% and a decrease in Duncan's Socio-Economic Index by 42%.

Adult Health and Childhood Disease
(Bozzoli, Deaton,and Quintana-Domeque
(2009))
Data on height from the European
Community Household Panel, the Health
Survey of England, and the National Health
Interview Survey in the US for individiuals
born in 1950-1980. Data on post-neonatal
mortality from the World Health
Organization. n=316.
Also used data on women's heights from
the international system of Demographic
and Health Surveys on women aged 15-49
in more than 40 countries in the late 1990s2000s. Data on infant mortality from the
United Nations population division.
n=1514.

Analyzed relationship b/n postneonatalmortality (PNM, death after 28
days and before first birthday) and adult
height. PNM is a measure of childhood
health environment. OLS regression with
adult height as outcome variable,
controlling for country and year fixed
effects and a time trend. Also controlled
for neonatal mortality rates and GDP in
year and country of birth. Considered
mortality from pneumonia, intestinal
disease, congenital anomalies, and other
causes separately.

Survivors are expected to be positively selected relative to those who died, but
may still be stunted by illness. In poor countries, the selection effect dominates,
whereas in rich countries (with low mortality rates) the stunting effect dominates.
Overall correlation b/n PNM and average adult height of the same cohort in a
given country = -0.79. In the US, PNM was 3x larger than in Sweden in 1970.
This diff accounts for 20-30% of the 2-cm diff in average height b/n 30-yr-old
Americans and Swedes in 2000. After controlling for PNM, no relationship b/n
adult height and GDP in the year and country of birth. Biggest determinant of
differences in PNM rates across countries is mortality from intestinal disease,
followed by mortality from pneumonia. Out of the 4 determinants of PNM, only
mortality from pneumonia has a significant negative effect on adult height.

Stature and Status: Height, Ability and
Labor Market Outcomes
(Case and Paxson (2008a)). Data from
NCDS (on cohort of individuals born in
week of 3/3/1958 in Britain), BCS, NLSY
(on siblings in the US), and Fragile
Families and Child Well-Being Study (on
young children in the US). NCDS:
n=9155; BCS: n=9003; NLSY: n=13884
(total, not siblings); Fragile Families:
n=2150.

Analyzed relationship b/n adult height and
cognitive ability as a potential explanation
for the significant and positive relationship
b/n adult height and earnings that is
observed. Adult height is a proxy for early
childhood health conditions. OLS
regression of cognitive test scores on
height-for-age (HFA) z-scores,controlling
for background and demographic variables
(using NCDS, BCS and Fragile Families
data). Same regression with mother fixed
effects using NLSY79 data. OLS
regression of log hourly earnings on adult
height, controlling for cognitive test scores
at ages 7, 10, and 11, and other
background and demographic variables.

Child's height and cognitive test scores at age 3:
1 SD increase in HFA z-score linked to a 0.05-0.1 SD increase in PPVT score.
Child's height and cognitive test scores at ages 5-10: (reporting only mother
fixed effects results)
1 SD increase in HFA z-score linked to increased PIAT math score, PIAT reading
recognition score, and PIAT reading comprehension score by 0.03 SD. Height
does not explain differences in test scores across racial groups.
Adult height, earnings, and cognitive test scores:
Inclusion of cognitive test scores at ages 7, 10, and 11 makes the coefficient on
adult height insignificant for predicting hourly wages.
Height difference b/n men and women does not account for the
difference in earnings.

Height, Health and Cognitive Function at
Older Ages
(Case and Paxson (2008b)). Data from HRS
on men and women aged 50 and older from
1996 to 2004.
n=72,258.

OLS regression of health and cognition
measures on adult height, controlling for
age, survey wave, race and sex. Adult
height is a proxy for early childhood
health and nutrition.Also estimated
models including controls for childhood
health (self-reported), completed
education, and a dummy for employment
in a white-collar occupation.

1 in increase in height associated with:
0.9% increase in delayed word recall score
0.3% increase in probability of being able to count backwards
0.3% increase in probability of knowing the date
1.4% decrease in depression score
0.4% decrease in health status scale (1 = excellent, 5 = poor)
Childhood health, completed education, and employment in a white-collar
occupation all positively related to adult cognitive function and health. Inclusion
of these controls makes the coefficients on adult height insignificant except for
the cases of delayed word recall and depression.

The Role of Childhood Health for the
Intergenerational Transmission of Human
Capital: Evidence from Administrative
Data (Salm and Schunk (2008)).
Administrative data from the departmentof
health services in the city of Osnabrueck,
Germany, collected during official school
entrance medical examinations on children
aged 6 between 2002-2005. Sibling
sample: n=947. 321 children had at least
one parent w/ college degree.

Sibling fixed effects to estimate impact of
health conditions on cognitive and verbal
ability at school entrance. Controlled for
individual background characteristics.
Used the Oaxaca (1973) decomposition
and a nonparametric decomposition to
estimate how much of the gap b/n children
of college-educated parents and children of
less educated parents can be explained by
chronic childhood health conditions.

Mental health conditions reduce cognitive ability by 10% for the whole sample,
by 9% for college-educated sample, by 11% for less-educated sample. Asthma
reduces cognitive ability by 8% for less-educated sample only. Mental health
conditions reduce verbal ability by 11% for the whole sample, and by 13% for the
less-educated sample. Health conditions explain 18% of the gap in cognitive
ability and 65% of the gap in language ability b/n children of college-educatedand
less-educated parents.

Having had psychological problems during childhood leads to:
20% reduction in adult earnings ($10,400 less per year; $17,534 less family
assets)
reduction in number of weeks worked by 5.76 weeks per year
11pp reduction in likelihood of getting married
33.5pp reduction in educational attainment
(means not reported, so can't calculate relative effect sizes)
Costs of childhood psychological problems:
Lifetime cost: $300,000 loss in family income
$3.2 trillion cost for all those affected

Early Life Health and Cognitive Function
in Old Age (Case and Paxson (2009))
Region-level historical data on mortality
from infectious diseases, as well as total
infant mortality. Data for 1900-1936 from
Grant Miller's data archive on NBER
website. Data for 1937-1950 from Vital
Statistics documents. Data on later life
outcomes from Health and Retirement
Study for 1996-2004 on men and women
aged 50-90. n=60,000

Identification due to variation in mortality
rates across time and regions. OLS
regression of later life outcomes on log
mortality rates from various infectious
diseases in year of birth and in 2nd year of
life in region of birth. Controlled for age,
sex, race, and current census region of
residence.

Decrease in infant mortality by half during 2nd year of life associated w/ an
increase in delayed word recall score by 0.1 SD. Significant negative impacts of
typhoid, influenza, and diarrhea mortality in 2nd year of life on delayed word
recall score. (Means not reported so can't calculate relative effect sizes).
Weaker associations b/n disease mortality and ability to count backwards. No
significant impacts of disease mortality and overall mortality during year of birth,
once mortality in 2nd year of life is included, on either of the later life outcomes.
Results not robust to adding census region-specific time trends.

Child Health and Young Adult Outcomes
(Currie et al (2009))
Administrative data on public health
insurance records from the Canadian
province of Manitoba on children born b/n
1979 and 1987, followed until 2006.
n=50,000.

Sibling fixed effects of the long term
effects of health problems at various child
ages controlling for health at birth (with
birth weight and congenital anomalies).
Key explanatory variables examined are:
asthma, major injuries, ADHD, conduct
disorders, and other major health problems
at ages 0-3, 4-8, 9-13, and 14-18. Key
outcome variables: achievement on
standardized test on language arts in grade
12, whether child took college-preparatory
math courses in high school,whether child
is in grade 12 by age 17, and welfare
participation after becoming eligible at 18.

Results reported below are only those that control for health problems at all
age groups:
An additional major health condition at ages 0-3/4-8/14-18 increases the
probability of being on welfare by 10%/9%/31%.
Effects of major health conditions at younger ages on educational outcomes not
significant when controlling for health at ages 14-18.
ADHD/conduct disorders diagnosis: at ages 0-3/4-8/9-13/14-18 decreases
probability of being in grade 12 by age 17 by 4%/10%/17%/19%; at ages 4-8/913/14-18 increases probability of being on welfare by 38%/44%/109%; at ages 48/9-13/14-18 decreases probability of taking a college prep math class by
11%/25%/35%; at ages 4-8/9-13/14-18 decreases literacy score by 0.15 SD/0.23
SD/0.27 SD.
Effects of asthma at younger ages not statistically significant once health at ages
14-18 is controlled for.
Major injury: at ages 0-3/14-18 increases probability of being on welfare by
7%/9%; at ages 9-13/14-18 decreases probability of
being in grade 12 by age 17 by 2%/2%; at ages 9-13/14-18 decreases probability
of taking a college prep math class by
6%/8%; at ages 9-13/14-18 decreases literacy score by 0.03 SD/0.03 SD.
Children who have a major physical health condition and then recover do not
have significant adverse outcomes. Children with mental health conditions,
children with major health conditions at ages 14-18, and those with conditions
that persist for multiple age periods suffer worse outcomes.

The Impact of Childhood Health on Adult
Labor Market Outcomes
(Smith (2009))
Data on siblings from PSID. Childhood
health measured as a selfreportedretrospective health index
regardinghealth at ages younger than 17.
Adult outcomes measured in 1999.
n=2,248.

Sibling fixed effects to estimate impact of
self-reported retrospective childhood
health status (on a 5-point scale) before
age 16 on adult earnings, employment,
education, marital status, etc., controlling
for demographics and family background.

Better health during childhood increases adult family income by 24%, increases
adult family wealth by 200% (relative to mean=$2000), and increases adult
earnings by 25%.
Better health during childhood increases probability of having worked the year
before by 5.4pp (mean not reported).
About 2/3 of overall impact of poor childhood health on adult family income is
present at age 25; the remaining 1/3 is due to a slower growth path after age 25
due to poor childhood health. About 1/2 of overall impact of poor childhood
health on individual earnings is present at age 25; the remaining 1/2 is due to a
slower growth path after age 25 due to poor childhood health. No statistically
significant impacts of childhood health on educational attainment.

The Effect of Childhood Conduct Disorder
on Human Capital
(Vujic et al. (2009))
Data from the Australian Twin Register on
twins born between 1964 and 1971. Data
collected in 1989-1990 and 1996-2000
n=5322 twins; 2250 identical twins

Twin fixed effects to estimate impact of
childhood conduct disorder (measured by
various indicators based on diagnostic
criteria from psychiatry on educational
attainment and criminal behavior in
adulthood. Controlled for birth weight,
timing of the onset of conduct disorders,
and other family and individual
background characteristics. Conducted
separate analyses for all twins and
identical twins.

Childhood conduct disorders lead to:
5-16% decrease in likelihood of high school graduation
100-228% increase in likelihood of being arrested (mean=.07)
6-68% increase in likelihood of grade retention
20-60% increase in likelihood of having 3+ job quits (not significant in identical
twin sample)
50-325% increase in likelihood of telling lies (mean=.04)
37-526% increase in likelihood of going to jail (mean=.019)
Earlier occurrence of conduct disorder has larger negative effects than later
occurrence.

Causes and Consequences of Early Life
Health
(Case and Paxson (2010a))
Data from NCDS, BCS, PSID, Whitehall II
Study (longitudinal study of British civil
servants b/n ages 34 and 71, collected from
1985 to 2001), HRS, and NLSY79. See
Case and Paxson (2008a) and (2008b) for
more info on the data sets.
n=11,648 (NCDS), 11,181 (BCS), 63,995
(PSID), 29,774 (Whitehall II), 66,269
(HRS), n=3,200-46,000 (NLSY79)

Multivariate regression of educational
attainment, employment, log earnings, and
self-reported health status and cognitive
function on adult height in inches (proxy
for early childhood health) using 5
longitudinal data sets. Controlled for age,
ethnicity, sex, and survey wave. Used
sibling fixed effects in NLSY79 to
understand what aspects of early life
health adult height captures - regressed
children's test scores, grade level, selfperception in school, and childhood health
outcomes on children's HAZ.

Results from NCDS, BCS, PSID, Whitehall II, and HRS:
One inch of height is associated with: 0.05-0.16 more years of schooling; 0.2-0.6
pp increase in likelihood of employment; 0.012-0.028 increase in average hourly
earnings for men; 0.007-0.027 increase in average hourly earnings for women.
A 4-in increase in height leads to: 8% decrease in probability of long-standing
illness; 40% decrease in probability of disability; 4% of SD decrease in depression
score.
Results from NLSY79 (reporting sibling fixed effects only) indicate that 1 pt.
increase in HAZ leads to: 0.3% increase in PIAT math score; 0.1% increase in
PIAT reading recognition score; 0.2% increase in PIAT reading comprehension
score; 0.9% increase in digital span test score; 0.4% increase in PPVT score. 2%
decrease in likelihood that child is in appropriate grade level for age (ages 6-14).
1% increase in child doing school work quickly; 1% increase in child
remembering things easily; 0.9% increase in Total Scholastic Competence score.
8% decrease in likelihood that child has limiting emotional/neurological
condition; 0.105 increase in birth weight z-score (mean not reported).

The Long Reach of Childhood Health and
Circumstance: Evidence from the Whitehall
II Study
(Case and Paxson (2010b))
Data from the Whitehall II Study (see
above for description). n=10,308

HOME ENVIRONMENT
The Impact of Maternal Alcohol and Illicit
Drug Use on Children's Behavior Problems:
Evidence from the Children of the National
Longitudinal Survey of Youth (Chatterji
and Markowitz (2000)).
Data from the 1988, 1992, and 1994 waves
of NLSY-Child surveys on children who
were 4-14 yrs old during the survey years.
n=6194 children in total sample; n=2498
mothers who have siblings in sample;
n=7546 obs for children who have 2 or 3
observations in sample.
Parental Employment and Child Cognitive
Development (Ruhm (2004)).
Data from the Children of NLSY79 for
1986-1996 (mothers aged 29-38 at the end
of 1995). n=3,042.

Since most Whitehall II study participants
belong to the highest occupational classes,
estimated the selection effect using data
from NCDS and BCS for comparison.
OLS regressions of initial placement and
promotion in Whitehall on height, family
background characteristics, educational
attainment, and other individual
characteristics. Also estimated individual
fixed effects and first-differenced
regressions of future promotions on selfreported health, and of future health on
grade in Whitehall.

Selectivity of Whitehall II study attenuates the impact of father's social class on
various outcomes relative estimates that would be obtained in the full population.
OLS regressions indicate significant correlations between family background
(father's social class), initial placement and likelihood of promotion. Significant
relationship between initial placement and promotion, height, and self-reported
health. Although some of the effects of health on placement and promotion are
mediated by educational attainment, there is an independent effect of health.
Individual fixed effects estimates indicate that cohort members who report
"excellent" or "very good" health are 13% more likely to be promoted (relative to
lowest grade). No effect of grade in Whitehall on future health.

Estimated impact of maternal substance
abuse on children's behavior problems
using OLS, IV, child-specific & maternal
family fixed effects models. In IV, used
alcohol and illicit drug prices as
instruments for maternal substance abuse.
Controlled for numerous demographic and
background variables. Behavior problems
measured by the Behavior Problems Index
(higher BPI means more problems).

No statistically significant relationship between maternal substance abuse and
child behavior in IV regressions, but 1st stage relationship is weak. Fixed effects
suggest that 1 more drink consumed by mother in past month increases child BPI
by 1%.
Maternal marijuana use in past month increases child BPI by 7-8%. Maternal
cocaine use in past month increases child BPI by 19%.

OLS to estimate the impact of maternal
work in the year prior to child's birth, and
in the first 4 years of child's life on child
cognitive test scores at ages 3-4 and 5-6.
Used a rich set of controls for maternal
background, demographic, and socioeconomic characteristics, as well as
assessment year fixed effects. Maternal
work measured both by hours and weeks
worked during the year. Controlled for
family income.

20 more hrs worked each week by mother during child's 1st year:
decrease PPVT Score by 0.06-0.10 SD (ages 3-4)
20 more hrs worked each week by mother during child's age 2-3:
decrease PIAT-Reading score by 0.06-0.08 SD (ages 5-6)
decrease PIAT-Math score by 0.05-0.06 SD (ages 5-6)
Results robust to alternative specifications (measuring employment by weeks
worked or part-time vs. no employment). More negative effects on PPVT and
PIAT-Math scores for boys than girls. More negative effects on PIAT-Reading
scores for girls than boys. More negative effects on PPVT an PIAT-Reading
scores for whites than blacks. More negative effects on PIAT-Math scores for
blacks than whites.

Maternity Leave, Early Maternal
Employment and Child Health and
Development in the US
(Berger, Hill, and Waldfogel (2005))
Data from the Children of NLSY79 on
children born b/n 1988 and 1996. n=1,678.

OLS and propensity score matching to
estimate impact of maternal return to work
within 12 weeks of birth on child health
and developmental outcomes. Models
control for numerous background
characteristics as well as state and year of
birth fixed effects. Sample limited to
mothers who worked pre-birth.

Mother returning to work within 12 weeks of giving birth leads to:
2.5% decrease in likelihood of well-baby visit
12.8% decrease in likelihood of any breastfeeding
40.4% decrease in number of weeks breastfed
4.3% decrease in child getting all DPT/Polio immunizations
Results from OLS consistent with results from propensity score matching
methods. Larger negative effects of returning to work full-time within 12 weeks
of giving birth compared to any work at all.

Evidence from Maternity Leave Expansions
of the Impact of Maternal Care on Early
Child Development
(Baker and Milligan (2009))
Data from the NLSCY in Canada on
children up to age 29 months and their
mothers in 1998-2003.

Identification due to large expansions in
parental leave policies in Canada on Dec.
31, 2000 (from 25 to 50 weeks of leave).
OLS regression. Key explanatory variable
is a dummy for birth after Dec. 31, 2000.
Outcomes include child development
indicators, maternal employment, and use
of child care. Controlled for various
individual and family background
characteristics as well as labor market
variables. Observations from Quebec
omitted due to changes in childcare
policies over the same time period.
Observations from single-parent families
omitted b/c of expansions in benefits to
those families. Subsample analysis for
women who returned to work within 1
year of child's birth.

Expansions in parental leave policies led to a 48-58% increase in months of
maternal care during the 1st year of life and a 25-29pp decrease in non-parental
care. No statistically significant effects of parental leave expansions on child
development indicators (motor/social development, behavior, physical ability,
cognitive development).

The Effect of Expansions in Maternity
Leave Coverage on Children's Long-Term
Outcomes (Dustmann and Schonberg
(2009)).
Administrative data on students in
Germany attending public schools in Hesse,
Bavaria, and Schleswig-Holstein (3 states
in Germany) for 2002-03 to 2005-06.
n=101,257.
Administrative data on social
securityrecords for German individuals
born b/n July 1977 and June 1980.
n=140,387

Identification due to 3 policy reforms in
Germany that expanded unpaid and paid
maternity leave to estimate impact on
adult wages, employment, and educational
outcomes. First reform in 1979 increased
paid leave from 2 to 6 months. Second
reform in 1986 increased paid leave from
6 to 10 months.Third reform in 1992
increased unpaid leave from 18 to 36
months. OLS regression, comparing
children born one month before and after
each reform,controlling for background
variables and state fixed effects. Also
difference-in-difference, comparing
children born before and after leave
expansions with children born in the same
months the year before (hence not affected
by expansions).

Despite significant delays in maternal return to work due to policy reforms, there
are no statistically significant impacts of expansions in maternity leave policies
(paid or unpaid) on any long-run outcomes (wages, employment, selective high
school attendance, grade retention and grade attendance).

Child Protection and Adult Crime: Using
Investigator Assignment to Estimate Causal
Effects of Foster Care (Doyle (2008)).
Data from Computerized Criminal History
System from the Illinois State Police on
arrests and imprisonment up to age 31 for
2000-2005, linked with child abuse
investigation data on individuals who are
18-35 in 2005. n = 23,254.

IV models of the effect of foster care
placement on measures of criminal
activity. Identification due to the fact that
child protection cases are randomized to
investigators, and investigators influence
whether a child is placed in foster care or
remains at home. Model allows for
treatment effect heterogeneity -- used
random coefficient model. IV where the
instrument is the investigator's probability
of using foster placement relative to the
other investigators.

Children on the margin for placement into foster care are 1.5 times more likely to
be arrested, 2.68 times more likely to have a sentence of guilty/withheld, 3.41
times more likely to be sentenced to prison if they are placed into foster care.
Children on the margin are likely to include African-Americans, girls, and young
adolescents.

Long-term Consequences of Child Abuse
and Neglect on Adult Economic WellBeing (Currie and Widom (2009)).
Sample of abused/neglected children based
on court-substantiated cases of childhood
physical and sexual abuse in 1967-1971 in
one Midwestern metropolitan county.
Maltreated children matched to controls on
the basis of sex, race, and elementary
school class/hospital of birth. Cases
restricted to children 11 yrs or younger.
Adult outcomes measured at mean age 41.
Used info collected in 1989-95 and 2003-04
interviews. n=1195 in 1989-95; n=807 in
2003-04. Matched sample (both members
of matched pair interviewed during the 2
waves): n=358.

Multivariate regression with key
explanatory variable being a dummy for
having been maltreated. Controlled for
demographic and family background
characteristics, as well as quarter of year at
time of interview. Also estimated models
separately for males and females and for
the subsample of participants whose
families received food stamps or welfare
when they were children.

Individuals who were maltreated as children:
complete 4.3% less years of schooling (1989-95)
score 5.3% lower on IQ test (1989-95)
have 24% lower imputed earnings (2003-04)
are 0.52 times as likely to have a skilled job (1989-95)
are 0.46 times as likely to be employed (2003-04)
are 0.58 times as likely to own a vehicle (2003-04)
For males, the only significant effects of maltreatment are for years of schooling
and having a skilled job. For females, significant negative effects of maltreatment
on years of schooling, IQ testscores, imputed earnings, being employed, owning a
bank account,owning a stock, owning a vehicle, and
owning a home. Effects larger for females than for males.

Child Maltreatmentand Crime
(Currie and Tekin (2006))
Data from the National Longitudinal Study
of Adolescent Health (AddHealth). First
wave: 1994-95; last wave: 2001-2002.
n=13,509 (full sample), n=928 (twins
sample).

OLS, propensity score matching, and twin
fixed effects methods. Estimate the impact
of maltreatment on criminal activity.
Controlled for numerous demographic and
background characteristics as well as state
fixed effects. Also controlled for parental
reports of chlid being bad-tempered or
having a learning disability.

Only results that are significant in all 3 main specifications (OLS, propensity
scores, and twin fixed effects) are reported.
Children who experienced any maltreatment are:
99-134% more likely to commit any non-drug related crime (mean=0.109)
288-489% more likely to commit a burglary (mean=0.009)
113-181% more likely to damage property (mean=0.052)
106-131% more likely to commit an assault (mean=0.049)
183-222% more likely to commit a theft>$50 (mean=0.018)
76-101% more likely to commit any hard-drug related crime (mean=0.085)
96-103% more likely to be a crime victim (mean=0.077)
Probability of crime increases if a person suffers multiple forms of maltreatment.
Being a victim of maltreatment doubles the probability that an individual is
convicted as a juvenile.
Cost-Benefit: Estimated costs of crime induced by abuse=$8.8-68.6 billion/year
Estimated costs of home visiting programs (that have been shown to reduce cases
of maltreatment by 50%)=$14 billion/year

The Effect of Maternal Depression and
Substance Abuse on Child Human Capital
Development
(Frank and Meara (2009))
Data from Children of NLSY79 on children
aged 1-5 in 1987. n=1587.

ENVIRONMENTAL SHOCKS
Environmental Policy as Social Policy? The
Impact of Childhood Lead Exposure on
Crime (Reyes (2007)).
Data on lead in gasoline for 1950-1990 on
a state-by-state level from Yearly Report of
Gasoline Sales by State, Petroleum
Marketing Annual, and Petroleum Products
Survey. Data on air lead exposure from the
EPA's Aerometric Information Retrieval
System. Data on per capita crime rates from
the Uniform Crime Reports compiled by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation for 19852002. Data on Data on individual blood
lead levels from NHANES for 1976-1980
only.

OLS regression of the impact of maternal
depression and substance abuse on
maternal inputs and children's outcomes in
grades 1-5 and 6-9. Controlled for a rich
set of demographic and background
variables including family measures of
parent and sibling behavior and health.
For robustness, estimated models using
sibling fixed effects (comparing siblings
born to the same mother) and propensity
scores.

Effects on maternal inputs:
Maternal depression leads to a 0.2 SD decrease in emotional stimulation subcomponent of the HOME score (ages 7-10, 11-14)
Maternal substance abuse leads to a 0.23 SD decrease in emotional stimulation
sub-component of the HOME score (ages 11-14)
Effects on child outcomes:
Maternal depression leads to a 0.46 SD increase in behavioral problems index
(ages 7-10, 11-14).
Maternal alcohol abuse leads to a 0.31 SD decrease in child's PIAT math score
(ages 11-14); 0.29 SD increase in behavioral problems index (ages 7-10); 377%
decrease in likelihood of ever being suspended or expelled at any age
(mean=0.22).

Used state-by-state variation in the decline
of lead exposure from gasoline between
1975 and 1985 due to enforcement of the
Clean Air Act to identify the impacts of
childhood lead exposure on violent crime
in young adulthood. Also estimated the
impact of lead exposure on levels of lead
in blood during childhood for robustness.
Primary measure of lead exposure is the
grams of lead per gallon of gasoline in
automobile sources. Calculated air lead
exposure (measure of average
concentration of lead in the air in each
state and year). Calculated effective lead
exposure relative to each crime in each
state and year as the weighted average of
lead exposure b/n ages 0 and 3 for all
cohorts of arrestees. Regression of per
capita crime rate on effective lead
exposure, controlling for state and year
fixed effects and other state-year
characteristics that could affect crime
rates.

Elasticity of violent crime with respect to lead exposure = 0.8.
Changes in childhood lead exposure in the 1970s are responsible for a 56%
decrease in violent crime in the 1990s (while abortion is responsible for a 29%
drop in violent crime). Weak evidence for link b/n lead exposure and murder or
property crimes.
Cost-Benefit Analysis: Cumulative social cost of switching to unleaded gasoline:
$15-65 billion. Cumulative social benefit of reduced crime from reduced lead
exposure: $1.2 trillion. Note, due to data limitations, it is not possible to make a
direct connection between blood lead levels, lead in gasoline, and criminal
activity at the individual level.

The Long-Term Effects of Early Childhood
Lead Exposure: Evidence from Sharp
Changes in Local Air Lead Levels Induced
by the Phase-Out of Leaded Gasoline
(Nilsson (2009)).
Data on air lead exposure from Swedish
Environmental Protection Agency thatuses
a nationwide grid of moss samples collected
in 1000 locations evenly spread across
Sweden for average lead exposure levels for
1972-74, 1977-79, and 1982-84. Individual
outcome data from the Educational
database at the Institute for Labor Market
Policy Evaluation in Uppsala, Sweden on
those born in 1972-74, 1977-79, and 198284.
n=797,889

Identification due to geographical
variation in childhood lead exposure due
to a policy in Sweden that induced a phaseout of leaded gasoline between 1973 and
1981. Difference-in-difference comparing
children born in municipalities that
experienced large reductions in lead
exposure to those born in municipalities
with relatively no change, before and after
policy went into effect, to estimate impact
of childhood lead exposure on later life
outcomes. Also used mother fixed effect
methods, comparing siblings who
experienced different levels of lead
exposure in childhood. Controlled for
various background characteristics as well
as year of birth and municipality of birth
fixed effects.

A decrease in blood lead levels by 30 mg/Kg leads to:
3% decrease in likelihood of being in the lower end of the GPA distribution
0.6pp increase in average IQ for males
0.05 yr increase in schooling attainment
0.7pp increase in likelihood of graduating high school
0.5pp decrease in likelihood of receiving welfare in adulthood
Effects of lead are stronger at lower end of ability/skills distribution and for
children from poorer households. Effects of lead are stronger when exposure is at
ages 0-2 than when exposure is at ages 5-7. No statistically significant difference
in effects by gender. Nonlinear effects - significant and negative effects of lead
exposure above 75th percentile (>50mg/kg). No statistically significant effects of
exposure to lead below 75th percentile levels.
Estimated that there exists a blood lead threshold of 60 mg/L below which
reductions in lead exposure have no effect on outcomes. Similar results using
mother fixed effects.
Note: means not reported, so relative effect sizes can't be calculated.

Note: Unless otherwise noted, only results significant at the 5% level are reported. Percent changes reported relative to the mean.

High school as a proxy for EITC eligibility. Effect of
interest is interaction between <HS*treatment*after
EITC expansion.

Results
OLS results suggest that AFDC has negative effects. Sibling fixed
effects indicate no significant effects. IV results suggest that AFDC
during pregnancy causes large increases in mean birth weight among
poor whites only. Hence, evidence suggests that AFDC has neutral or
positive rather than negative effects. Negative estimates driven by
selection.
A $1000 increase in annual income raises cognitive achievement by
0.06 of SD for children aged 2-5. No statistically significant effects of
income on children aged 6-9 or 10-15.
A 3-SD increase in the proportion of quarters that welfare is received
leads to a 1.5 SD decrease in cognitive achievement among 10-15
year-olds.

Spending out of unanticipated vs. anticipated change in CB:
15x greater for alcohol in 2-parent households; 10x greater for adult
clothing in lone-parent households.
Results suggest that parents fully insure children against income
shocks so that unanticipated changes only affect spending on adult
goods.
Birth weight: Increased by 0.4% for all women
Incidence of low birth weight: Decreased by 3.7% for all
No statistically significant effects on # prenatal visits or maternal
smoking during pregnancy.

The Impact of Family Income on Child
Achievement: Evidence from the Earned
Income Tax Credit (Dahl and Lochner (2008)).
Data from NLSY on children and their mothers
for 1988-2000. n = 4720 children (2527
mothers).

Identification based on EITC expansions in 19871993 and 1993-1997 that increased benefits for lowand middle- income.Used simulated instrumental
variables (IV): IV is predicted change in EITC
income. Controlled for family background and
demographic variables and for time-varying statespecific policies that might affect child outcomes.
Examine contemporaneous and lagged income. Also
estimate OLS and child fixed effects models.

A $1000 increase in income raises combined math and reading scores
by .06 SD.
Larger gains from contemporaneous income for children aged 5 to 10
than for those aged 11-15.
Larger gains for children from disadvantaged families.

Do Child Tax Benefits Affect the Well-being
of Children? Evidence from Canadian Child
Benefit Expansions (Milligan and Stabile
(2008)). Data from Survey of Labor and
Income Dynamics on families with children for
1999-2004 for benefit simulation. Data from
Canadian National Longitudinal Study of
Children & Youth for 1994-2005 for children
10 and under. (n=56,000).

Instrumental variables. Used variation in child
benefits across time, provinces, and number of
children per family to develop a measure of benefit
income as IV for child benefits in regressions of the
effect of child benefits on child outcomes. Controlled
for province-year fixed effects. Also reduced forms
for simulated benefits' effect on child outcomes.

An increase in $1000 in simulated benefits leads to: 1.5% reduction
in likelihood of learning disability (if mom < HS);
3.6% decline conduct disorder/aggression score 4-10; 4.3% of SD
decline maternal depression;
11.6% SD decline in maternal depression (if mom < HS); 1.1%
decline in child ever experiencing hunger (if mom < HS)
Larger positive impacts on education and physical health for boys
than girls; larger positive impacts on mental health for girls. Effects
on math and vocabulary scores, behavioral outcomes, maternal
depression and likelihood of ever experiencing hunger persist at least
4 years.

South African Child Support Grant (CSG):
Unconditional cash transfer program with
payments made to child's primary caregiver.
Intended to cover the country's poorest 30% of
children. Study of effects on child nutrition
(Aguero et al. (2009)). Data from KwaZuluNatal Income Dynamics Study. Main outcome
measure: Height-for-Age z-score (HAZ).
T=245, C=886.

Exploit varying lengths of exposure to CSG among
children aged 0-3 due to the timing of the rollout of
CSG. Fit a quadratic OLS model to application
delay (number of days between program creation and
child's enrollment) using data for children born <=2
years prior to survey date. Calculated an expected
application delay variable for each child conditional
on birth date, location and family characteristics,
defined as % deviation in application delay from
expected delay. Conditional on family
characteristics, deviation in delay, and observables,
the extent of CSG treatment should be random.Use
generalized propensity scores, MLE.

No gains in HAZ for treatments covering <=20% of the 0-3 window.
HAZ 0.20 higher for treatment covering 2/3 of window than for a
child receiving treatment covering 1% of window. Benefit-cost ratio
of CSG: Between 1.06 and 1.48 (estimating lifetime earnings gains
from gains in HAZ, using annual 5% discount rate, and assuming
unemployed 33% of time).
Results robust to checking for age cohort effects and location/spacial
effects.

Conditional Cash Transfer Programs (CCT)

Mexican "Progresa" program (now

of 20-30% of household income every 2
months. Families must take young children to
health clinics, immunizations, get adequate
prenatal care, & receive nutrition supplement.
(Families also to keep older children in school)
(Gertler (2004)). Data from survey collected
from experimental villages. Sample sizes:
7,703 children underage 3 at baseline; 1,501
newborns; Height analysis: T=1,049, C=503;
Anemia analysis: T=1,404, C=608.

Program phased in. 320 treatment villages and 185
control villages randomly selected. Control villages
received benefits 2 years after start of program. They
did not know this would be the case. Investigate 0/1
treatment dummy as well as different lengths of
program exposure.

Treatment Effects:
Newborns 25.3% less likely to be ill in past month.
Children 0-3 22.3% less likely to be ill in past month.
Height (12-36 mos) 1.2% higher.
Probability of being anemic (12-48 mos) 25.5% less.

indicators for early childhood development.

Treatment Effects:
Developmental screener (DDST social-personal): increase by 0.13
SDs
DDST language: increase by 0.17 SDs
Receptive vocabulary (TVIP): increase by 0.22 SDs. (Children made

Effects by age: DDST language: up 0.06 SDs 0-35 mos., 0.20 SDs 6083 mos.
TVIP: up 0.05 SDs 36-59 mos., up 0.36 SDs 60-83 mos. (Oldest
children made up 2.4 months of delay on TVIP)
No statistically significant differences by gender.
Transmission mechanisms: Better diet; more likely to have books,
paper, pencils;more likely to be read to; more likely to have checkup,
vitamins,de-worming drugs; more likely to be enrolled; more likely to
see doctor when ill.

Results
Introduction of FSP is associated with: 18% increase in total food
expenditures (whole sample);
26-28% increase in total food expenditures for female-headed HHs; 613% increase in total food exp. for non-white female-headed HHs. No
significant effect on meals out and cash expenditures on food at home.
Elasticity of food spending with respect to income = 0.30. MPC for
food out of cash income = 0.09 (for whole sample);
MPC for food out of cash income = 0.111 ( <$25,000 income); MPC
for food out of FSP income = 0.16 (for whole sample);
MPC for food out of FSP income = 0.238 (<$25,000 income).
Decrease in whether the HH head reports any work by 21%.
Free school lunch reduces food expenditure by 15% of the purchase
price of the lunch.
Free pint of milk reduces milk expenditure by 80%.

IIntroduction of FSP in 3rd trimester led to: 0.06-0.08% (0.1-0.2%)
increase in birth weight for whites (blacks); a 1% (0.7-1.5%) decrease
in fraction of low birth weight for whites (blacks). Insignificant
impacts of exposure to FSP during earlier trimesters.
Results robust to adding fixed-effect and other controls, as well as
various time trends to the analysis. Results robust to conducting an

gestation, pre-pregnancy FSP, WIC.

Increasing average monthly FSP benefits from $0 to $100 decreases
probability of gaining too little weight by 11.8-13.7%. No effect on
probability of gaining too much weight. No statistically significant
difference in effects of FSP on weight gain between first-time and nonfirst-time mothers.

Results

Two-sample instrumental variable (TSIV) of the effects of
living in public housing projects on child's education, housing
conditions. Outcome variables are in SIPP and Census.
Endogenous regressor is in CPS. Instrument is a dummy for
siblings being of different sexes since families with different
sex children get larger apartments in public housing than
families with same sex children. Controlled for per-capita
availability of projects, vouchers, Section 8 subsidies, as well
as other neighborhood and family background characteristics.

First stage results: Having siblings of different sex increases likelihood
of family living inproject by 24%.
Second stage results: Families who live in projects are 16pp (mean =
.04)l ess likely to be overcrowded; and 12pp (mean =.02) less likely to
live in high-density housing. Children who live in projects are 111%
less likely to have been held back in school (larger effects for boys than
for girls). Black children who live in projects are 19% less likely to
have been held back in school. No statistically significant effect for
white children.

Amemiya generalized least squares regression where the
instrument was the vector of residuals from a regression for
the number of public housing units per eligible family in the
area on demographic characteristics of the area. Instrumented
for whether child lived in public housing to estimate impact
on various adult outcomes. Controlled for numerous
background characteristics and state and year fixed effects.

Living in public housing as a child leads to an increase in the
probability of any employment b/n ages 25 and 27 of 7.8%; an increase
in annual earnings b/n ages 20 and 27 of 14.3%; an increase in the
number of years not on welfare b/n ages 20 and 27 of 11.3%. No
statistically sigificant effect on household earnings relative to the
poverty line. Note: above results significant at 6% level.

Neighborhood Effects on Crime for
Female and MaleYouth: Evidence
from a Randomized Housing
Voucher Experiment
(Kling, Ludwig and Katz (2005))
Data from Moving to Opportunities
(MTO) experiment. Families living
in public housing projects in
Boston, Los Angeles, NewYork
City, Baltimore, and Chicago were
randomly chosen to stay in their
current home, to receive a section 8
housing voucher, or to receive a
section 8 housing voucher
restricted to use in neighborhoods
w/ poverty rate less than 10%.
Surveys conducted in 2002. Data
on youths aged 15-25. Data on
arrest records for MTO states.
n=4,475.

OLS regression of crime outcomes on dummy for whether
family used a voucher (instrumented by whether family was
assigned to treatment group) or on voucher type, and on an
age-treatment interaction variable. Instrument necessary since
not all families who were assigned a voucher chose to use it some remained in their initial housing.

Assignment to a restricted voucher leads to a 31% decrease in violent
crime arrests for female youths. Use of restricted voucher leads to a
76% reduction in violent crime arrests among female youths. No
statistically significant effects on males for violent crime arrests.
Assignment to a restricted voucher leads to a 33% decrease in property
crime arrests for female youths. Use of restricted voucher leads to a
85% decrease in property crime arrests forfemale youths. Assignment
to a restricted voucher leads to a 32% increase in property crime arrests
for male youths.
Use of restricted voucher leads to a 77% increase in property crime
arrests for male youths.

youths aged 6-20. n=5,074

Same regression as Kling, Ludwig, and Katz (2005) for
educational outcomes.

Children in families assigned to a restricted voucher attend better
quality schools: the mean rank of schools on state exams is 30% greater
than the control group mean, and the mean proportion of school-luncheligible children is 8% lower. No statistically significant effects of
either voucher on child educational outcomes (school attendance,
whether child does homework, child's behavior in class, whether child
attended class for gifted students or class for special help, and
Woodcock-Johnson Revised reading and math test scores).

15pp higher among those born at the end of the year relative
to those born at the beginning of the year). IV regression,
where first stages are: regression of being held back at age 15
on timing of birthday and regression of proportion of
neighborhood youths held back at age 15 on their birthdays.
Second stage is regression for being held back at age 16 on
having been held back at age 15 and proportion of
neighborhood youths held back at age 15. Controlled for year

Results

Compared WIC participants and non-participants in the
sample of women whose deliveries were paid by
Medicaid. Addressed selection bias by comparing a
broad range of observable characteristics between
eligible WIC participants and non-participants.

WIC mothers are negatively selected into the program relative to all
Medicaid recipients. WIC participants are 1.4-1.5 times more likely to
have had prenatal care in 1st trimester; 0.7 times as likely to give birth to
low birth weight infant; 0.9 times as likely to give birth to infants who are
below the 25th percentile of birth weight given gestational age; 0.9 times
as likely to have their infant admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. WIC
associated with increases in maternal weight gain, gestation, and birth
weight. Larger impact for more disadvantaged women (such as those who
received public assistance, high school drop-outs, teen mothers, single
mothers).
WIC participation reduces the likelihood of low birth weight by 12.9pp
(imprecise estimate). No statistically significant effect of WIC on
gestational age or likelihood of prematurity.

Instrumental variables comparing marginally eligible
and ineligible WIC women. Marginally ineligible for
WIC=families not participting in NLSP during
pregnancy, but participating during either the year
before or after. Marginally eligible=families that
received NSLP during the pregnancy, but did not
receive the lunches at least one adjacent year. A federal
policy change that increased income reporting
requirements for WIC eligibility in September 1999,
made it more difficult for eligibles to obtain WIC. The
instrument for WIC participation is an interaction
between an indicator for the policy change and
eligibility.

Data from birth certificate files in New

women who were on Medicaid and/or
WIC during pregnancy. (n=35,415 in
1988-1990; n=50,659 in 1994-1996;
n=52,608 in 1999-2001)

Multivariate regression with dummies for WIC
participation, interacted with year of birth. To address
selection bias, limited analysis to women with first
births who initiated prenatal care in first 4 months of
pregnancy. Estimated separate models by race,
ethnicity, nativity, and parity. Estimated same model
comparing twin births.

Among US-born blacks, WIC participants are 2.4pp less likely to
experience a low birth weight birth than non-WIC participants in 19881991. No statistically significant effects of WIC participation for foreignborn Hispanic women. In twin analysis, for US-born blacks, WIC
participation is associated with a 55 g increase in birthweight adjusted for
gestation, and a 3.9pp decrease in SGA rates. Effects biggest for US-born
black women under age 25. (Note, means for subgroups not reported, so
effect sizes can't be calculated).

Multivariate regression with dummies for WIC in each
trimester. To deal with selection bias, estimated
separate models by race/ethnicity. Also analyzed
subgroups whose pre-pregnancy characteristics put
women at high risk for anemia, low weight gain, and
intrauterine growth retardation. Finally, analyzed
subgroup of first-births.

Conditional on gestational age, mean birth weight is 40g greater among
prenatal enrollees than post-partum enrollees. Rates of SGA are 1.7pp
(14%) less, and rates of term low birth weight are 0.7pp (30%) less.
Difference between 1st and 3rd trimester enrollees in mean birth weight is

Difference-in-difference, using variation in the timing
of WIC implementation across different counties in
1972-1979, to estimate impact of WIC availability on
birth weight. Controlled for three measures of per
capita government transfers, an indicator for Food
Stamp program availability, other demographics, and
county and year fixed effects, and state-year fixed
effects. Scaled estimates by WIC participation rates.
Also conducted sub-group analysis in county-yearmaternal education level cells.

If WIC is available in a county by the third trimester, average birth weight
increases by 0.1% (estimate not scaled by participation rate). Among
women with low levels of education, WIC increases average birth weight
by 10% (esimate scaled by participation rate) and reduces the fraction of
births classified as low birth weight by 11% (estimate scaled by
participation rate). No effects of WIC on fertility - so results not driven by
selection into birth.

Investing in Health: The Long-Term
Impact of Head Start on Smoking
(Anderson, Foster, and Frisvold (2009)).
Data from the PSID. Used smoking data
from 1999 and 2003 on individuals aged
21-36 in 1999.
n = 922 in 1999; n = 1005 in 2003.

Compared smoking of siblings who did and did
not attend Head Start or any preschool using
sibling fixed effects. Controlled for family
background characteristics specific to the age
children were eligible for Head Start.
Examined sibling differences that might be
predictive of Head Start attendance. Examined
spillover effects by including interactions
between Head Start and birth order.

Results from 1999 data:
Head Start participants are 58% less likely to smoke than siblings
Results from 2003 data:
Head Start participants are 65% less likely to smoke than siblings.
Including control for educational attainment makes results statistically
insignificant.
Cost-Benefit: PV reduction in smoking is $9,967 per participant (using
3% discount rate, accounting for medical expenses and productivity
losses) Average cost per Head Start participant in 2003 is $7,092.
Depending on discount rate used, the value of reduction in smoking is
associated with 36-141% of program costs.

Expanding Exposure: Can Increasing the
Daily Exposure to Head Start Reduce
Childhood Obesity?
(Frisvold and Lumeng (2009))

Estimated the effect of full-day vs. half-day
Head Start on obesity at end of school year.
Identification via elimination of a grant which
led to a decrease in the # of full- day classes
from 16 classrooms in 2002 to 4 classrooms in
2003. (IV=% full-day funded slots). Controls
for observable family characteristics.

First Stage Results: 10pp increase in percentage of full-day slots
increases likelihood of full-day attendance by 85% (relative to
baseline=11% enrollment in full-day slots in 2003).
Second Stage Results: Full-day enrollment in Head Start decreases
likelihood of obesity by 143%. This implies that children who attended
full-day classes would have been almost 3 lbs heavier had they attended
half-day classes. Simulation results suggest that the 143% change in the
likelihood of obesity can be explained by a change in caloric intake of 75
calories per day with no change in physical activity.

than other children.

Does Prekindergarten Improve School
Preparation and Performance?
(Magnuson, Ruhm, and Waldfogel (2007))
Data from ECLS-K. n = 10,224.

Primary method is a multivariate regression to
estimate the impact of Pre-K attendance on
various outcomes. Robustness checks using
teacher fixed effects, propensity score
matching, and instrumental variables (IV). IV
is different measures of access to pre-K in a
given state. Dependent variables are measured
in the fall of kindergarten and in the spring of
first grade to assess any lasting impacts of PreK.

Pre-K attendance: increases reading scores at school entry by 0.86 SD
(IV); increases aggression at school entry by 0.69 SD (IV). No effect on
math scores or self control in IV. Effect sizes for all outcomes are larger
for Pre-K than for other forms of child care, but Pre-K children have
different characteristics than other children. Among children attending
Pre-K in the same public school as their kindergarten, higher reading
scores are not accompanied by increased behavioral problems. For
disadvantaged children, cognitive gains are more lasting than in the
whole sample. Effect sizes for cognitive outcomes much lower in spring
of 1st grade than at school entry. Effect sizes for behavioral outcomes are
the same.

Administrative data on child care
institutions and their locations for 19721996. Restricted sample to individuals
whose mothers were married at the end of
1975.
n = 499,026 children; 318,367 families.
Adult outcomes measured between ages 30
and 33.

Difference-in-differences. Exploited a child
care reform in 1975 in Norway, which assigned
responsibility for child care to local
governments, and thus resulted in great
variation in child care coverage for children
aged 3-6 both between cohorts and across
municipalities. T = municipalities where child
care expanded a lot; C = municipalities where
child care did not change much. Compared
changes in outcomes for treatment and control
adults who were 3-6 years old before and after
the reform. Also investigated heterogeneity of
effects. Controlled for various child and familyspecific characteristics, as well as municipality
fixed effects. Robustness checks: included a
time trend, checked for placebo effect by
comparing the two groups before the reform,
and used sibling fixed effects comparing
siblings exposed to the reform to those who
were not.

TT Effects (ITT effects in parentheses)
One more child care place: increases educational attainment by 2.7%
(0.4%)
decreases probability of dropping out of HS by 22.8% (3.8%)
increases probability of college enrollment by 17% (2.5%)
decreases probability of having little or no earnings by 23.3% (3.9%)
increases probability of having average earnings by 7.4% (1.3%)
decreases probability of being on welfare by 31.9% (5.6%)
decreases probability of parenthood by 10.4% (1.8%)
increases probability of being single with no children by 23.3% (4%)
Almost all of the reduction in probability of being a low earner is driven
by females. Women more likely to delay child bearing and family
formation than men as a result of increased child care. Most benefits of
universal child care are for children of low-educated mothers.
Subsidized formal child care crowds out informal child care with
almost no net increase in total child care use or maternal
employment. No impact of child care reform on maternal education.
Cost-Benefit Analysis: Cost: Annual budgetary cost per child care place
= $5400
Benefit: Increase in 0.35 yrs of education implies an increase in $27,000
in lifetime earnings.

The percentage of 15-44 yr old women eligible for Medicaid (had
they become pregnant) rose from 12.4% to 43.3% b/n 1979 and
1991.
A 30% increase in eligibility leads to a 1.9% decrease in
incidence of low birth weight (sig. at 10% level) and a 8.5%
decrease in infant mortality rate. For targeted program changes, a
30% increase in eligibility decreases low birth weight (infant
mortality) by 7.8% (11.5%). For broad program changes a 30%

in infant mortality rates; 1.3% in low birth weight (whole
sample); 8.9% in low birth weight (single parents). No impact on
birth weight among married women.

Changes in Prenatal Care Timing and Low Birth
Weight by Race and Socioeconomic Status:
Implications for the Medicaid Expansions for
Pregnant Women (Dubay et al. (2001)). Data on
births from the 1980, 1986, and 1993 Natality
Files. n = 8,100,000 births.

Difference-in-difference, subtracting difference in
obstetrical outcomes (rates of late initiation of prenatal
care and rates of low birth weight) b/n 1980 and 1986
from difference in outcomes b/n 1986 and 1990, within
socioeconomic (SES) groups. Also compared changes in
obstetrical outcomes in 1986-93 b/n women of low and
high SES (since high SES women were not affected by
Medicaid expansions). SES defined by marital status and
years of schooling. Medicaid expansions occurred in
1986-93. Controlled for year, age of mother, parity, and
age-parity interactions.

Results from Diff-in-Diff Within SES:
Medicaid expansions associated with decreases of:
12-21% prenatal care initiation after 1st trimester for white
women; 3-5% in low birth weight among white women w <12
years education;
10-13% in prenatal care initiation after 1st trimester for black
women w <12 years education;
13-27% in prenatal care initiation after 1st trimester for black
women w 12-15 years of education;
12-35% in prenatal care initiation after 1st trimester for black
women >15 years of education.
Association with a 3% increase in likelihood of low birth weight
for unmarried black women with <12 years education
Similar results using diff-in-diff across SES for 1986-93.

Data on birth outcomes from VSDN files 19901996. Data on fetal deaths from vital statistics

administrative reforms from National Governor's
Association Maternal and Child Health
newsletters. Data on welfare caseloads from the

n=3,985,968 whites; 4,014,935 blacks.

Logit regression that includes dummies for state-level
Medicaid administrative reforms; income eligibility
cutoffs; rates of welfare participation; unemployment
rates; and maternal observable characteristics. Also
estimated auxiliary regressions that examine the effect
of policy variables on aggregate Medicaid caseloads.

Medicaid caseload increases by 0.233 for each 1% increase in
welfare rate. Medicaid caseload increases by 0.664 for each
100% increase in income cut-off (for those not receiving cash
benefits). Increase in income cutoff from 100% to 200% of
poverty line increases probability of adequate prenatal care by
0.4% for whites. 2pp increase in welfare rate associated w/ 1.1%
increase in probability that prenatal care was initiated in 1st
trimester; 0.7% increase in probability of adequate care for
whites; 2% increase for both for blacks.
Increase in income cutoff from 100% to 200% of poverty line
associated w/ a decrease of 1720 fetal deaths per year among
blacks
2% increase in welfare associated w/ 10% decrease in fetal
deaths per year among blacks. Most administrative reforms have
no effect. But using mail-in forms (instead of in-person
interviews) increases probability that prenatal care was initiated
in 1st trimester by 0.7% for blacks and
horter forms increase probability that prenatal care was initiated
in 1st trimester by 3% for whites. Using mail-in forms decreases
probability of
low birth weight by 26%; of very low birth weight by 38% for
whites.

Using Discontinuous Eligibility Rules to Identify
the Effects of the Federal Medicaid Expansions
on Low-Income Children (Card and ShoreSheppard (2004)). Data from SIPP for 1990-93,
March CPS for 1990-96, and Health Interview
Survey for 1992-1996 on children under 18 years
old. n= 10,268 to 16,196 across the different
years in SIPP.

Two sources of identification: "The 133% expansion"
(children under age 6 living in families with incomes
below 133% of poverty line became covered in 1989) and
"the 100% expansion" (children born after September 30,
1983 in families with incomes below the poverty line
became covered). Difference-in-difference design
comparing age-6 and age-5 children in families with
incomes between 100% and 133% of the poverty line for
the 133% expansion, and comparing children born before
and after Sep. 30 , 1983 for the "100% expansion".
Regression of Medicaid enrollment on dummy for being
below poverty level, dummy for being born after
9/30/1983, their interaction, dummy for age <6 years old,
interaction between dummy for age <6 years old and
dummy for being between 100% and 133% of poverty

effects, as well as other observable characteristics.
Robustness checks: Estimating same model for married
women only (unlikely to be on welfare, hence unlikely to
be subject to MMC); controlling for mobility b/n
counties; regression discontinuity design to eliminate
time trend effects; adding interaction terms b/n time trend
and several dummies; "intent- to-treat" models to control
for the MMC adoption being not exogenous to counties.

The 100% expansion led to 7-11% take-up rates, while the 133%
expansion had <5% take-up rates. No evidence for other
insurance crowd-out in SIPP data. Results from CPS data
suggest that the 133% expansion led to decline in other health
insurance coverage by approximately the same amount as the
take-up in Medicaid. Similar results using Health Interview
Survey data.

Probability of starting prenatal care in 1st trimester: decreased by
9-10% in both COHS and 2-plan counties.
Use of induction/stimulation of labor: increased by 43.8% in
COHS counties. Use of fetal monitors: increased by 25.9% in
COHS counties.
Incidence of low birth weight: increased by 15% in both COHS
and 2-plan counties. Incidence of short gestation: increased by
15% in both
COHS and 2-plan counties. Incidence of neonatal death:
increased by 50% in 2-plan counties.

Low Take-Up in Medicaid: Does Outreach
Matter and for Whom? (Aizer (2003)).
Data on monthly Medicaid enrollment for
children aged 0-15 in CA from 1996 to 2000
linked with information on the number of
community-based application assistants in each
zip code in the month of application by age and
race. n = 324,331 for analysis of take-up. n =
121,806 for analysis of hospitalizations.

Examined effects of CA outreach campaign launched in
June 1998, which consisted of community-based
application assistants and a media campaign to raise
awareness about Medicaid, on Medicaid enrollment.
Multivariate regression with key explanatory variable
being the number of community-based application
assistants in each zip code in the month of application by
age and race. Included zip code and month fixed effects
as well as controls for changes in business cycle and the
demographic compositions of the state. Also examined
effect of early Medicaid enrollment on ACS
hospitalizations by instrumenting Medicaid enrollment
with outreach measures.

Access to bilingual application assistants increases new monthly
Medicaid enrollment by 4.6% among Hispanic children, and by
6% among Asian children (relative to other children in same
neighborhood). A 1,000-child increase in Medicaid enrollments
decreases ACS hospitalizations by 3.26 hospitalizations (mean
not reported, so can't calculate relative effect size).

Public Insurance and Child Hospitalizations:
Access and Efficiency Effects (Dafny and Gruber
(2005)).
Data from NHDS on child discharges for 1983 to
1996. Cells defined for 4 age categories (<1, 1-5,
6-10, 11-15) for each state and year.
n = 2308 cells. Used age-state-year populations
from the Census Bureau to calculate
hospitalization rates for each cell.

Investigated impact of Medicaid expansions on
hospitalizations using the variation in Medicaid eligibility
b/n states, over time, and by age. Key explanatory
variable is the eligibility rate measured by the fraction of
children eligible for Medicaid in each age- state-year cell.
Controlled for age, state, and year fixed effects as well as
state-year interactions. Used the fraction eligible
calculated using a fixed sample to instrument for actual
eligibility in each state, year, and age group. Also
examined effect of Medicaid eligibility on length of stay
in hospital and the number of procedures performed.

A 10pp increase in Medicaid eligibility leads to a 8.4% increase
in total hospitalizations, an 8.1% increase in unavoidable
hospitalizations, and no statistically significant impact on
avoidable hospitalizations. Assuming access to hospital care
increases the likelihood of all kinds of hospitalizations equally,
these results imply that increased use of primary care engendered
by Medicaid expansions mitigated the increase in total
hospitalizations by reducing the increase in avoidable
hospitalizations that would have otherwise occurred.
A 10pp increase in eligiblity leads to a 3.1% decrease in the
length of hospital stay, a 5% increase in the # of procedures
performed, and a 6.6% increase in the likelihood of having any
procedure performed, i.e. leads to more aggressive care.

Public Health Insurance, Program Take-Up and
Child Health (Aizer (2007)).
See Aizer (2003) entry for description of data.

See Aizer (2003) entry. Additional analysis: Examined
heterogeneity in effects on take-up by age. Examined
nonlinear effects on take-up. Examined effects of English
and Spanish language advertisements on take-up.

Proximity to an additional bilingual application assistant
increases new monthly Medicaid enrollment by 7-9% among
Hispanics and by 27-36% among Asians. Smallest effects for
infants who were already largely eligible; largest effects for ages
6-15. Effect is linear for Hispanics; slightly concave for Asians.
English language advertisements increase Medicaid enrollment
in the following month by 4.7% among all children, and Spanish
language advertisements increase Medicaid enrollment in the
following month by an additional 2.5% among Hispanic
children.
Increasing the # of children w/ Medicaid by 10% results in a 23% decline in avoidable hospitalizations.

Has Public Health Insurance for Older Children
Reduced Disparities in Access to Care and
Health Outcomes? (Currie, Decker, and Lin
(2008)).
Data from the National Health Interview Surveys
for 1986-2005. n = 474,164 children <18 yrs old.
Instrument data from the CPS.

Identification due to the fact that expansions in
Medicaid/SCHIP eligibility for older children relative to
younger children happened at different times in different
states. Instrumented for individual Medicaid/SCHIP
eligibility using an index of generosity of the state's
public health insurance programs calculated using a fixed
group of children. Then, estimated impact of public
health insurance eligibility on the relationship b/n family
income and child health status and on the relationship b/n
family income and doctor visits in the previous year. Also
tested whether the relationship b/n income and outcomes
changed over time within age groups by running separate
regressions for 4 age groups: 0-3, 4-8, 9-12, 13-17.
Finally, estimated relationship b/n health outcomes and
the fraction of children eligible in child's birth cohort in
the child's current state of residence for children aged 917. Controlled for family background variables and year
and state fixed effects.

For children aged 9-12, the coefficient on income in a model of
health status declined by 20% over 2000-2005. For children aged
13-17, it declined by 18% over 1996-2000 and by 25% over 200005.
For children 0-3/4-8/9-12 the coefficient on income in a model of
doctor visits declined by 64%/62%/50% between 2000-2005.
For children aged 13-17 there was no significant change in the
income coefficient. Significant declines in the income
coefficient over 1991-1995 and 1996-2000 for children aged 0-3
and 4-8 as well.
No statistically significant impact of contemporaneous health
insurance eligibility on child health status.
A 100 pp increase in the fraction eligible at age 3 would reduce
the probability that the average child aged 9-17 is in less than
excellent health by 11%. A 100 pp increase in the fraction
eligible at ages 1 and 2 would reduce the probability that the
average child aged 9-17 had no doctor
visit in the past year by 41%.

The Impact of Children's Public Health Insurance
Expansions on Educational Outcomes (Levine
and Schanzenbach (2009)).
Data on state-level average scaled test scores
from the National Assessment of Educational
Progress for 1990 to 2003. (n=431).
Data for simulated instruments from March CPS.

4th and 8th grade reading and math test scores.
Difference-in-difference-in-difference using cross-state
variation over time and across ages in children's health
insurance eligibility due to Medicaid and SCHIP
expansions. Instrumented for public health insurance
eligibility using the simulated fraction eligible (as in
Currie and Gruber (1996) see above). To test whether
changes in educational outcomes are due to
improvements in health status or to additional household
income generated if the availability of public health
insurance crowds out private health insurance, they
estimated the direct impact of health at birth on
educational outcomes. Controlled for state and year fixed
effects and state-specific time trends.

A 50 pp increase in eligibility at birth increased reading test
scores by 0.09 SD relative to 4th and 8th grade combined mean
scaled score. No effect on math test scores. Expansions to
public health insurance eligibility at birth associated w/ 1.6%
reduction in low birth weight rate for whole sample and 6.7%
reduction in infant mortality rates among women with at least a
high school degree. A 50% increase in low birth weight (infant
mortality) rate would decrease reading test scores by 0.12 SD
(.07SD).

Estimated impacts of public health insurance eligibility
on measures of care utilization (doctor's visits, etc.) as
well as on private insurance take-up. Also estimated the
differential effect of eligibility on those w/ and w/out
private health insurance by interacting the eligibility
variable with the "offer" variable. Controlled for
background characteristics as well as state and year fixed
effects. Also looked at impacts of differential
reimbursement rates across states and years on access to
care for the publicly insured.

Note: Percent changes (denoted by % instead of "pp") are reported relative to the mean.

Public insurance eligibility increases public insurance coverage
by 21% and decreases private insurance coverage by 24%. So
overall decrease in insurance coverage of about 4.8%. Eligibility
decreases the number of office visits/self-reported health
status/total expenditures by 12%/87%/23%. Increases the
number of ER visits by 18%.
Eligibility decreases the number of office visits by 18% for those
with outside private health insurance. No statistically significant
effects on ER visits, prescriptions, or refills.
Children just eligible for public health insurance are 4% less
likely to have a usual source of care and 4% more likely to go
without care. No statistically significant effects on hospital or ER
visits.
Eligibility increases children's BMI by 2%. Parents of just
eligible children are 5% less likely to be given advice about their
child's eating healthfully. No significant effects on asthma
diagnosis. Conditional on taking medication for asthma,
eligibility increases probability of taking inhaled steroids (gold
standard treatment) by 32%. A $4 increase in reimbursement for
office visits leads to a 5% increase in the number of office visits.
