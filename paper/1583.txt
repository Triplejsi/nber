On the Complementarity of Commercial
Policy, Capital Controls
and Inflation Tax
ABSTRACT

This paper studies the optimal use of distortive policies aimed at
raising a given real revenue, in a general equilibrium framework in which

lump—suni taxes are absent, The policies analyzed are an inflation tax,
commercial policy, and an implicit tax on capital inflows implemented by

capital controls. It is shown that we would tend to avoid activating an
inflation tax for small revenue needs. Furthermore, if the
allocative, we would tend to use only one policy instrument.

policy target were
Thus, each

policy has its own comparative advantage, and their combined use is justified

when the target is raising government revenue. As a by-product of the paper,
we study the determinants of exchange rates, prices, and quantities in an
economy subject to capital controls and commercial policy.

ON THE COMPLEMENTARITY OF COMMERCIAL POLICY, CAPITAL
CONTROLS, AND INFLATIOJ TAX

1. Introduction
Open economies frequently restrict trade in goods and assets, and

occasionally follow inflationary policies. As is well known, such policies
are inefficient for small economies, provided that they find lump—sum policies

feasible. Thus, the frequent application of distortive policies suggests that
lump-sum policies are not feasible. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate
the implications of the absence of lump-sum policies for the complementarity

of distortive policies used as a means of raising government revenue, In the

absence of lump-sum taxes the policy maker should attempt to use an optimal
mixture of other taxes in an attempt to raise a given revenue at the lowest

possible social cost. Identifying that mixture will generate predictions
regarding the optimal associations between distortive policies and the size of

government revenue. This paper solves this problem for a small open economy
in which commercial policies, capital controls, and an inflation tax are the

feasible means of raising revenue.1 It applies general equilibrium analysis
for the case in which cash balances are needed to facilitate the exchange of
goods, and capital controls introduce a wedge between domestic and foreign
rates of' return. The analysis proceeds by deriving a welfare measure for a

marginal change in the policies and in government revenue. Such a measure
implies that whenever the revenue requirements of the government are small, we

would not impose an inflation tax. This reflects the fact that equilibrium
with zero government revenue is distorted due to the lack of appropriate
interest payments in the money market, whereas all other markets are free from

distortions. Thus, at the margin, raising government revenue by tariffs or
capital controls would be associated with a small deadweight loss relative to

-2-

the use of an inflation tax. An increase

in revenue needs would be associated

with a greater use of restrictive trade and capital control policies,
consequently raising the marginal deadweight

loss At some stage, however,

the resultant distortion would equate the marginal deadweight losses caused by

using either tariffs or capital controls or an inflation tax as alternative

means of revenue sources. Thus, a further expansion in government demand
would be associated with the simultaneous use of an inflation tax and other

distortive policies. Although the discussion does not include such
alternative policies as a labor tax, it can be readily extended to cover a
broader policy spectrum without altering

the main results.

To focus on issues related to financing government activity, the paper

considers a perfect foresight model. Thus, it neglects the potential
motivation for applying restrictive policies in order to affect the degree of
exposure of domestic agents and domestic policies to foreign unanticipated
shocks. •To formulate the ipflation tax, we assume a flexible exchange rate

system (a similar analysis can be conducted for a gliding parities system).
Capital controls are modeled in the context of' a modified dual exchange rate,
under which the controls generate a wedge between the exchange rates applied
for current and capital account transactions.

An alternative interpretation

of capital controls would be as a policy of imposing a tax on purchases of

foreign assets. Commercial policy is modeled as a tariff. While the details
of the analysis are model-specific, its main

conclusion should be robust: the

absence of lump—sum taxes generates complementaritY

between the various

distortive policies applied to generate a given government

revenue at the

lowest welfare cost. The nature of this complementaritY will depend, however,
upon both the magnitude of government

revenue needs and the structure of the

economy.

The paper specializes the discussion by considering a specific utility

—3-.

function. This allows us to find the closed—form solution of all prices and
quantities and thus to assess the effects of capital controls and tariffs on
both the exchange rate and on the wedge between the exchange rates applied for

vrious transactions. One can use this framework to assess the desired
combination of policies to be implemented to achieve specific targets. The
paper demonstrates that if the target is to reduce consumption of imports
only, a tariff policy should be implemented, whereas if the target is to
change the intertemporal allocation of consumption, only capital controls

should be implemented. Thus, each policy has its own comparative advantege,
and their combined use is justified when the target is raising government
revenue.

The plan of the paper is to introduce in section 2 the problem for the
case of a general periods separable utility, deriving the welfare measure for

marginal policy and revenue changes. Section 3 specializes the discussion for
a specific utility, deriving closed-form solutions for all prices and all
quantities. Section 14 applies the model to derive optimal policies to be

implemented for the attainment of specific targets. Appendix A provides the
detailed derivation of some of the steps in section 2, and appendix B
summarizes the notation applied in the paper.

2. The Model
Let us consider the minimal framework needed to obtain a measure of the
welfare cost associated with raising government revenue using either tariffs,

capital controls, or an inflation tax. For a tariff, we consider a model with
two goods, exportables and importables. For capital controls, we assume the
existence of a traded bond, whose domestic trade might be subject to

restrictions. For intertemporal considerations needed to generate a demand
for the bond, and the opportunity cost of holding money, we should consider at

a minimum a two-period model. To simplify notation we take the case of

introduction of money into a general

equilibrium model is not a trivial matter. The presumption made in this paper
is that the money provides services by reducing

the cost of exchanging

goods. The use of real balances promotes more efficient exchange and in so

doing saves costly resources. Those

resources might include time and capital,

which would be used to coordinate various transactiofls2 To simplify
exposition, the paper studies the case in which the exchange activity is time

intensive. A possible way of capturing this notion is by assuming that

leisure is a decreasing function of the velocity

because a drop in the velocity of circulation is associated with a higher
intensity of money use per transction, allowing

one to save on the use of time

Our consumer finances consumption and the use of money balances from his

initial endowment in period one. This endowment includes money balances
carried over from period zero, endowment of good X,

and the income paid on

the traded bonds held from period zero. Equation 7 reflects the assumption
that all restrictive policies are applied in period zero.5 Because period 1
is the "end" of our consumer's horizon, he does not purchase new bonds to
carry wealth into the future.

The government has three revenue sources: an inflation tax, tariffs, and
revenue from sales of foreign bonds at a premium. The revenue is used to
finance governmental activities. We assume that the authorities effectively
control trade in bonds. Agents can trade those bonds among themselves freely,
but they can make transactions with foreign agents only via the financial
authorities, which control the quantity of traded bonds sold to domestic

agents.6 Thus, capital control takes the form of quantity control, which

manifests itself in the premium f - 1.

This premium is market determined,

corresponding to B. A net sale of B bonds by the authorities in period 0

will generate revenue of f P0B. The cost for the authorities of purchasing
the bonds is given by P,QB. The net income from the wedge

outcome would occur if the authorities imposed a tax at a rate of

on capital inflows, allowing quantities to be market determined.8

Thus, in the absence of uncertainty, one can view the capital controls defined

in the paper as a policy that sets a quota B, under which the government
collects the quota rents, or alternatively as a policy that sets a tax

on capital inflows. In the first case, prices are market determined;

in the second, quantities. As in the case of commercial policy, the
equivalence between the two policies would break down in the presence of
uncertainty.

consumption equals to the net present

value of the endowment, where both are evaluated using distortion—free,
international prices.

The private budget constraint is given by equation 9, which takes

government policies as given. Private agents maximize their utility subject
to this constraint. For the resultant optimal behavior of the private sector
the fundamental budget constraint, given by equation 18, implies the

corresponding government revenue. Government policy is summarized by the
vector CM0, H1, B, t). For a given goverment policy the corresponding

revenue g is a function of both the prices and quantities set by the private
agents' behavior. Let

(M0, H1, B, t) be the resultant revenue

corresponding to a utility level of private agents given by U(M0, M1, B, t).
The problem facing the government is to choose policies that will maximize
private sector welfare subject to a given real revenue target (g0):

Because our system is homogeneous, real revenue and real equilibrium will
not be affected by an anticipated equa-proportiofl

rise in (M1, M0). To fix

ideas, consider the case in which the value of M0 is given (M0= ) ,

and

the government sets H1. In such a case money balances will increase by
H1 - M

in period 1. The increase is implemented by financing part of

government purchases of goods and services by issuing new money. Thus, the
solution to the government's problem, as described in equation 19, is reduced

to a choice of (M1, B, t). For a given, known governemnt policy, private

agents maximize utility U subject to equation 9, resulting in the following

Equation 23 is the key step in our present discussion.

It describes the

net welfare effect of raising government revenue Ag by a corresponding

marginal change in policies A (H1, B, t). It can be decomposed in terms
involving the marginal deadweight loss in the three distorted activities
induced by the change in policies (the first three terms), minus a term that

corresponds to the direct income effect induced by transferring Ag

—13-

resources. The deadweight loss in each activity equals the change in the
relevant activity times the distortion (given in the bracket of the first

three terms). Those distortions are proportional to the tariff rate, the

premium in the assets market (f — 1)

induced by capital controls, and the

nominal interest rates, when the factors of proportionality convert the

various terms into real units (in terms of X0). Notice that the relevant
quantity change in the money market is the change in real balances Am,
which in our analysis is implemented by a change in the price level9 (F)

we start with no distortions related to trade in goods and assets, and with
initial distortion in the money market proportional to the money interest

rate. The source of this distortion is the absence of interest payments on
money, resulting in positive opportunity cost of using an asset whose

"production" is free. Thus, we expect a marginal deadweight loss associated
with raising revenue via small tariffs and the effective use of' tax on capital

inflows, because initial distortions are absent in those markets.° This does
not hold, however, if revenue is raised via an inflation tax, because of the

presence of the initial distortion. Any further increase in revenue needs

point at which the marginal deadweight loss of a tariff or a tax on capital

on, we will make use of all means of taxation. Consequently, for large enough
revenue needs, we expect to observe a positive correlation between government

revenue and all sources of taxation. For small revenue needs, we will not use

future consumption (p)

higher nominal interest rate increases the cost of present consumption,
because it increases the cost of using the money balances needed to support

that consumption. Consequently, a higher nominal interest rate encourages
future consumption.

The premium of the financial exchange rate is proportional to the degree
to which capital controls introduces a bias towards present consumption

(relative to the case of no capital controls). The factor of proportionality
rises with the weight attached to future consumption (q)

and with the

magnitude of the anticipated commercial liberalization which is equal to the

tariff rate at period zero (t). Notice that the effect of increasing capital

inflows (dB>o) is to reduce the premium, due to their positive effect on z

consequently depreciating the financial rate.

4. Commercial Policy and Capital Controls as Alternative Means of Achieving
Policy Targets.

In the previous sections we analyzed the case in which distortive

policies were used as a means of raising taxes. Consider now an environment
in which the only policy objective is to affect the allocation of

consumption. The purpose of this section is to assess the comparative
advantages of commercial policy versus capital controls in achieving the

allocative target. In order to focus on those issues, it is useful to proceed
by assuming that there is zero net government revenue, and that the government
distributes its revenue from the various policies in a lump-sum manner.

Contrasting this section to section 3 will provide useful insight into the

effect of non—lump-sum policies. As we shall show, prices and quantities are
affected considerably when we assume redistribution of government gross
proceeds.

-

-22-

We preserve the assumptions regarding preferences given by equation 25.

We should adjust, however, all the budget

constraints so as to reflect the

presence of lump-sum distribution. First, we should add to the private budget
constraints (equations 6 and 7) the proceeds from transfers, given for the
aggregate by:

By their nature, lump—sums transfers do not affect marginal behavior.

Thus, equations 27-30 still hold. The aggregate budget constraints, however,
change. Thus we add the net present value of transfers to equation 9:

Thus, the aggregate private budget constraint is free now from monetary

Comparison of the case of no revenue needs (33') to the case of revenue

needs (33) reveals that the main difference is that f is now free from terms

that relate to the demand for money (such as y and )
equation 33 collapses to 33' for y + o

Notice that

The reason is that once all

seigniorage is transferred back, inflation does not affect the goods endowment

of the private sector. In section 3 higher inflation was a tax that affected

net endowment. Those effects were responsible for the presence of y and
in equation 33.

In the absence of capital controls z is given by

z1= 1 -

Again eq. 314' can be obtained from eq. 314 when y ÷ o

Notice that the effect of the absence of net tax revenue is that prices

in period two are now independent of the inflation in period zero. In section

3, past inflation entered prices in period 1 via its negative effect on net
o

endowment. This effect is absent in the case where g

For a given set of policies, one can apply all the first-order conditions

and equation 33' to equation 25, yielding a measure of the welfare level of a

We can use U tp assess the optimal design of policies aimed at
achieving a given policy target. Without the presence of such policy targets,

welfare is optimized by f1, to. Thus, in the absence of revenue or other
policy objectives, free trade in assets and goods is optimal. We will

consider two types of policy targets. First let us suppose that the policy
maker wishes to restrict imports in period zero. Next, let us consider the
case in which the policy maker wishes to affect the intertemporal allocation
of consumption.

5. Concluding Remarks
This paper demonstrates the complementary of capital controls, commercial
policy, and inflation taxes as means of revenue collecting It demonstrates
that we would tend to avoid activating an inflation tax for small revenue

needs. Capital controls considered in the paper are in the form of' an
implicit tax on capital inflow, which is

consistent with either a version of a

two—tier exchange rate or a direct tax on capital inflow. It should be noted
that the practical application of the various distortive policies would depend
upon the spectrum of alternative revenue raising tools. In the absence of a
well-developed tax structure, (including, for instance, income and consumption
taxes) a country might make intensive use of commercial policy, capital
controls, and inflation taxes as revenue devices.

In an economy with a well

developed tax system, we would expect more extensive application of more
traditional taxes. 13

Alternative forms of complementarity between inflation taxes and capital
controls would occur in the presence of currency substitution, thus eroding
the inflation tax base.

In such a case, capital controls would also be

applied in an attempt to reduce the use of for2ign currency as a menas of
payment.

While the details of the analysis described in this paper are model
specific, the general point should be model-free:

The absence of lump-sum

taxes generates complementarity between various distortive policies applied to
generate a given revenue at the lowest welfare cost. This complementarity

would not hold, in general, if the purpose of the distortive policies were to
achieve a given allocative goal.

We assume that only domestic money is used in co-ordinating domestic

transactions. The underlying structure of the economy described here
is that of a centralized market only in the case of financial

transactions (bonds) and for the exchange of goods and bonds across

borders. There is no centralized exchange of goods among domestic
consumers. The asymmetry between financial transactions and the
domestic exchange of goods among consumers is reflected in the
specification of velocity of money, which is defined only for
transactions that involve consumption.

5. We consider the case of a temporary tariff to allow us evaluation of
the intertemporal substitution introduced by anticipation of a tariff

liberalization. Allowing for a uniform tariff in both periods would
eliminate this effect, without affecting the results of our analysis
regarding the nature of the complementarity of the various policies.

6. It should be noted that in the context of capital controls the forms
of the technology of exchange is of crucial importance. For example,
the work by Greenwood and Kimbrough (1981) assumes a Clower
constraint applied separately to domestic and foreign goods when

foreign currency is needed to purchase foreign goods. They show that
under these conditions foreign exchange controls act like quota on

imports. This result would not hold in our case. Here we assume
that capital controls are applied to purchases of traded bonds, and
that there is a centralized exchange of goods across borders, and
that domestic exchange is using only domestic money.

Our economy is a modified flexible two-tier regime, under which
authorities have the flexibility to alter the existing stock of

foreign assets available to the public. This process is similiar to
an open market operation in traded bonds.

not affect the results (assuming an internal solution).

12. Notice that v1 does not depend on the interest rate, because 1 is

the terminal period. In a general k-period model, a typical

velocity would have the form v v. (R1), -R.

13. This suggests that liberlization attempts should be approached in
the context of the capacity of the government to replace restrictive
trade policies used as means of collecting revenue with alternative

sources of funds (oralternatively, liberalization attempts should
accompany a drop in government activities). For a related discussion
see Frenkel (1983).

the analysis of distortive policies, See, for example Jones (1979)
and Bhagwati and Ramaswami (1963).
