Education, Knowledge and the Evolution of Disparities in Health

ABSTRACT
We study how advances in scientific knowledge affect the evolution of disparities in health. Our focus
is the 1964 Surgeon General Report on Smoking and Health – the first widely publicized report of
the negative effects of smoking on health. Using an historical dataset that includes the smoking habits
of pregnant women 1959-1966, we find that immediately after the 1964 Report, more educated mothers
immediately reduced their smoking as measured by both self-reports and serum cotinine levels, while
the less educated did not, and that the relative health of their newborns likewise increased. We also
find strong peer effects in the response to information: after the 1964 report, educated women surrounded
by other educated women were more likely to reduce smoking relative to those surrounded by less
educated women. Over time, the education gradient in both smoking and newborn health continued
to increase, peaking in the 1980s and then shrinking, eventually returning to initial levels. These results
can explain why in an era of great advancements in medical knowledge, health disparities may actually
increase, at least initially.

Introduction

Health disparities by education in the US are large. Males without a HS degree have a death
rate double those with a college degree (Elo and Preston, 1996). Not only are health disparities
large, they are persistent, often originating in childhood or even earlier, in the newborn period
(Case, Lubotsky and Paxson, 2002; Currie and Stabile, 2003). A number of theories have been
put forth to explain the observed education disparities in health. We focus on one: that education
is related to one’s ability to obtain, process and/or act upon medical knowledge, consistent with
the theory of the production of health developed by Grossman (1972). If true, one implication is
that advances in medical knowledge will lead to improvements in health among the most
educated first, followed by eventual improvements among the less educated as knowledge
diffuses. Thus advances in medical knowledge can lead to an initial increase in health inequality
that declines over time as the knowledge diffuses.
To examine this empirically, we focus on how the first major advance in medical
knowledge regarding the effects of smoking on health affected both the smoking decisions of
pregnant women and the health of their newborns. Our analysis is comprised of three parts.
First, using an historical dataset of pregnant women 1959-1966 that, to our knowledge, is the
only dataset containing prospective information on smoking habits prior to 1964, we estimate the
immediate impact of the first massive dissemination of information on the health effects of
smoking (the 1964 Surgeon General Report on Smoking and Health) on the decision to smoke
and newborn health. Previous work analyzing aggregate administrative data on cigarette sales
found no decline associated with the 1964 Report (Sloan, Smith and Taylor, 2002). We too find
that aggregate cigarette consumption remained constant after the 1964 Report, but that this
masked important heterogeneity as the most educated women reduced their smoking
2

immediately after the 1964 Report while the least educated actually increased their smoking.
Moreover, the differential declines in smoking by education do not simply reflect differences in
reporting, as serum cotinine levels follow the same pattern. Nor do they reflect differential
declines by income or cognitive ability. Consistent with a negative relationship between smoking
and newborn health, we find that the education gradient in newborn health, as measured by birth
weight and fetal death, also increases immediately after publication of the report.1
We also explore the possibility that peers serve as a ―social multiplier‖ - exacerbating the
impact of information on the education gradient in smoking. We hypothesize that the education
level of peers affects one’s own response to the 1964 Surgeon General’s Report via two potential
channels. First, more educated peers may serve as an additional, indirect source of information
about the health effects of smoking (an information channel). Second, if one’s ability to quit is a
function, in part, of the smoking behavior of one’s peers, as in the cue-theory of consumption,
having more educated peers who are themselves less likely to smoke after publication of the
report increases one’s own probability of quitting (a behavioral channel). We find that the
education gradient in smoking increases three times as quickly after the 1964 Surgeon General’s
report among those most segregated by education. In other words, educated women surrounded
by other educated women are more likely to reduce their smoking after the report relative to
educated women surrounded by less educated women.
We follow the analysis of the short term effect of the 1964 Surgeon General Report on
disparities in smoking and newborn health with an exploration of how these disparities evolve
over time. We find that over time information appears to ―diffuse‖ to the less educated, as
evidenced by an eventual convergence in both knowledge of the negative effect of smoking on

There is some debate over whether the relationship between smoking and birth weight is causal which we discuss
later (see, for example, Almond, Chay and Lee, 2005).

health (as measured in public opinion surveys) and smoking behavior. And when it does, the
education gradient in newborn health likewise declines. These two trends in the education
gradient in smoking and newborn health mirror each other closely: increasing until the mid
1980s when they both peak, and then declining to 1960s levels by 2006, the latest year for which
data are available. These results have important implications for our understanding of how future
advances in medical knowledge and technological innovation are likely to affect both health and
health disparities over time. Moreover, by focusing on prenatal smoking, our results show how
advances in medical knowledge can affect inequality in future generations.
Finally, to better understand the connection between the gradients in smoking and
newborn health, we provide new estimates of the impact of smoking on newborn health using
multiple identification strategies. In so doing, we make two contributions to the existing
literature on smoking and birth weight. First, because we have siblings for a fixed effect analysis
and an independent measure of smoking in the form of serum cotinine levels, we can quantify
the extent of bias due to selection and measurement error, separately. Second, based on these
results we can explain why existing estimates differ based on the estimation technique used. We
conclude that the causal effect of smoking on birth weight is moderate in size (and non-linear)
and lies between existing fixed effect and IV estimates.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in section II, we discuss the relevant
literature; in section III we present results of our analysis of the immediate impact of publication
of the 1964 surgeon general’s report on the education gradient in prenatal smoking and newborn
health and explore the role of peers in increasing the gradient; in section IV, we trace the
evolution of the education gradient in smoking and birth weight over time to the year 2006. In
section V we present the results of our analysis of the impact of prenatal smoking on newborn

4

health, shedding light on the extent of bias in OLS estimates due to negative selection into
smoking and measurement error separately. Section VI concludes.

II. Background Literature
A. The Education Gradient in Health
The first major study to document differences in mortality by education in the US was
conducted by Kitagwa and Hauser (1973) based on data from 1960. Since then, a number of
additional studies have documented significant educational differences in mortality and other
measures of health (Elo and Preston, 1996; Christenson and Johnson, 1995; Deaton and Paxson,
1999; Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2006). Even the health of children is highly correlated with the
educational attainment of their parents (Case, Lubotsky and Paxson, 2002). Moreover, it appears
that these inequalities have been increasing over time (Elo and Preston, 1996; Pappas et al,
1993).
More recent work has sought to establish whether the relationship between education and
health is causal. Using compulsory schooling laws to instrument for education, Lleras-Muney
(2003) finds lower mortality rates for the more educated. Currie and Moretti (2003) instrument
for female education using the opening and closing of nearby colleges to estimate a significant
and positive relationship between maternal education and infant health. Both studies find a
larger effect of education on health in IV estimation relative to OLS, suggesting that any bias in
OLS estimates is likely downward due, presumably, to measurement error.

5

There are multiple potential mechanisms behind the relationship between education and
health.2 We focus on one - that education is related to an individual’s ability to learn and make
decisions about his or her health. This is consistent with Grossman’s 1972 model of the demand
for health in which education improves the efficiency with which individuals produce health.
Specifically, education may increase the efficiency of health production by reducing the costs of
obtaining medical information and/or using it. There is some empirical evidence to support this.
Glied and Lleras-Muney (2008) find that for diseases with more innovation in medical treatment,
education gradients in mortality increase, suggesting that the more educated take advantage of
new medical innovation more quickly. Rosenzweig and Schultz (1989) show that more educated
women have greater success with ―complex‖ contraception methods (eg, the rhythm method).
Price and Simon (forthcoming) find that after publication of research on the riskiness of a
particular procedure (VBAC), more educated women received differentially fewer of these
procedures.3 These studies establish a static response to information. They do not exmine how
the response may evolve over time. Nor can they necessarily separate an individual’s response
to information from either selective sorting to providers or providers’ differential treatment of
patients based on their educational status.

2

First, education may lead to better health because it leads to greater income and access to health care. However, the
documented relationship between education and health often remains, though somewhat diminished, when controls
for income are included, suggesting that income does not explain the entire relationship between education and
health (Elo and Preston, 1996; Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2006). A second possible mechanism may be that the
better educated tend to have less risky jobs. Again, Lleras-Muney and Cutler (2006) find that this can explain very
little of observed education gradients in health. Third, education may improve health by affecting one’s social rank.
The Whitehall studies (Marmot, 2002) documented a strong and positive relationship between social rank and health
among British civil servants. This is consistent with evidence based on experimental manipulation of social status in
animals: Sapolsky (1993) finds that lower ranked animals suffer worse health. A fourth potential mechanism is that
the more educated have lower discount rates, thereby increasing their value of the future and increasing their
investments in health. However, Fuchs (1982) and Leigh (1990) find little empirical support for this.

B. The Education Gradient in Smoking
Another area where education is likely to matter is in obtaining and using information on
unhealthy behaviors such as smoking. The less educated are more likely to smoke and this
relationship holds regardless of racial background or nativity (Kimbro et al, 2008). A number of
papers have sought to establish a causal relationship between education and smoking. Sander
(1995), using parental education as an instrument for own education in an IV regression, finds
that the highly educated are more likely to quit smoking. De Walque (2004) using exposure to
the draft for the Vietnam war as an instrument for college attendance provides some suggestive
evidence that education reduces smoking. Finally, and most relevant to the present study, Currie
and Moretti (2003) use the opening and closings of nearby colleges to instrument for maternal
education and find that more educated mothers are less likely to smoke while pregnant.4
A second strand of this literature seeks to link the education gradient in smoking with
medical knowledge about the health effects of smoking. Based on retrospective smoking
histories collected in 1978-2000, de Walque (2004) finds no discontinuous break in 1964 with
publication of the first SG report on smoking and health. Meara (2001) and Kenkel (1991)
explore whether knowing about the health effects of smoking can explain the relationship
between education and smoking. Both find that controlling for knowledge does little to change
the gradient in smoking but that smoking knowledge and education have important interactive
effects: the smoking of the more educated is more responsive to knowledge than the smoking
behavior of the less educated. The authors conclude that the education gradient in smoking may

4

Farrell and Fuchs (1986) find that differences in smoking behavior between the more and less educated are present
at age 17, before schooling is completed. They argue that this constitutes evidence that the relationship between
education and smoking is not causal. However, as de Walque (2004) also argues, these results are insufficient to
draw this conclusion because they do not account for the fact that much of the education gradient in smoking is
attributable to differences in quitting behavior which often occurs much after schooling is completed.

7

be less attributable to the fact that the more educated have more knowledge and more to their
greater responsiveness to that knowledge.
A significant difference, however, between this study and that of Kenkel (1991) and Meara
(2001) is that the reference period for this study is earlier, during a time when information about
the health effects of smoking was not widespread, as we show later. Thus the differential
declines in smoking that we observe with publication of the 1964 report may reflect faster
diffusion of knowledge to the more educated or faster modification of behavior based on that
knowledge, or some combination of the two.

III. Impact of the 1964 Surgeon General’s Report on the Education Gradient in Smoking

A. Knowledge about Smoking and Health
Knowledge about the health effects of smoking was accumulating in the scientific literature
throughout the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950’s. However, it was not until the US Surgeon General
issued its first Report on Smoking and Health in 1964, that the information was made widely
accessible. The National Library of Medicine characterized the impact of the 1964 Report as
follows:
―[Surgeon General] Terry issued the commission's report on January 11, 1964, choosing
a Saturday to minimize the effect on the stock market and to maximize coverage in the
Sunday papers. As Terry remembered the event, two decades later, the report "hit the
country like a bombshell. It was front page news and a lead story on every radio and
television station in the United States and many abroad."5

The report focused on the link between smoking and diseases of the lung, heart disease and birth
weight. After the first report, additional information about the effects of smoking on health
followed, starting with warning labels on all cigarette packages in 1966.6
Historical public opinion data are consistent with the hypothesis that publication of the
first SG Report on Smoking and Health increased the education gradient in knowledge about
smoking and health. In Table 1 We show how the education gradient in knowledge of a causal
link between smoking and heart disease evolved from 1957 to 1990. To do so we regress an
indicator equal to one of the respondent believes smoking is a cause of heart disease on three
education dummies (less than HS, HS, some college with college plus the omitted category) and
controls for race, age and gender.
In 1957 there is no education gradient knowledge of the impact of smoking on heart disease
but by 1969 there is a strong gradient which grows until 1981.7 Between 1981 and 1990,
however, the gradient begins to decline. This trend in the education gradient in knowledge
(initially increasing but starting to decline sometime between 1980 and 1990) is very similar to
the trends in education gradient in smoking and birth weight presented later. These findings
suggest that the trends in the education gradient in smoking and birth weight that we observe are

In 1971, cigarette ads were banned from TV; in 1979 the SG report concluded nicotine was addictive; in 1986 the
SG issued a report on second hand smoke and in 1998 there was a settlement reached between 46 state attorney’s
office and tobacco manufacturers limiting marketing to youths. See Chaloupka and Warner (2000) for a full
description.

On June 12, 1957, Surgeon General Leroy E. Burney declared it the official position of the U.S. Public Health
Service that the evidence pointed to a causal relationship between smoking and lung cancer. Kenkel and Liu (2008)
examine the school-smoking gradient in knowledge about lung cancer and find that it appeared prior to the 1964,
consistent with knowledge about smoking and lung cancer disseminating in 1957. However, knowledge about the
negative effects of smoking on other health conditions and health more generally was not widely known until the
1964 report. But the 1957 statement of the SG can, potentially, explain the small gradient in smoking prior to the
1964 Report.

likely attributable to the slower diffusion of knowledge about the negative effects of smoking to
the less educated.
B. Data
For the analysis of the immediate impact of the 1964 Surgeon General’s (SG) Report on
Smoking and Health we use data from the National Collaborative Perinatal Project (NCPP), a
prospective survey of 59,391 pregnant women who sought care in one of 12 urban Academic
Medical Centers in the years 1959-1966. To our knowledge, this is the only data that contains
information on smoking habits prior 1964 that was collected prospectively. The women were
randomly recruited to participate in the study through public clinics and thus the pregnant
women included in the study are characterized by less education and lower income than the
general population at the time. This sample selection aids in our ability to compare the behavior
and birth outcomes of more and less educated pregnant women because they sought and received
the same medical care in terms of both quality and quantity, thereby reducing other potential
differences across education groups. This, for example, implicitly allows us to rule out the
possibility that the differential declines in smoking are due to either differential sorting to
medical providers or providers treating women differently based on their education as all
providers in the study were instructed to follow a standard protocol.8
Descriptive statistics for the sample are presented in Appendix Table 1. Women under the
age of 19 or over the age of 35 at delivery were dropped from the analysis sample in order to
separate the effects of education from age. In column 1 are sample means for the analysis sample
(n=50,142); column 2 contains sample means for a subset of the data that consists of siblings
8

Though the sample characteristics remain relatively stable throughout the period, we present the results of
weighted regressions in which the weights reflect the age, education and income distribution of the women in 1964
and applied to all other years. The results are very similar to un-weighted regressions.

10

(n=17,530). The average years of schooling is 11 and half of the women in the sample have not
completed high school. The sample is racially mixed: 50 percent white, 43 percent black and 7
percent Hispanic (all from Puerto Rico and thus US citizens). Perhaps most remarkable are the
rates of smoking among pregnant women as recorded in the third trimester: nearly half of the
women smoked and those who did smoked on average half a pack of cigarettes daily.
C. Results
Publication of the First SG Report on Smoking and Health on January 11, 1964 resulted in an
immediate decline in smoking among women with at least a high school degree relative to those
without a high school degree (Figures 1a and 1b).

Several observations can be made based on

these figures. First, prior to publication of the report in 1964, overall rates of smoking while
pregnant were very high (47 percent) and differences in smoking between HS drop outs and HS
graduates were relatively small (about a 5 percentage point difference, or ten percent). Second,
smoking is actually increasing over this period among the less educated, so much so that the
decline in cigarettes smoked by HS graduates after 1964 is compensated for by the increase in
smoking among HS drop outs. Figure 1C shows that the total number of cigarettes smoked per
day over this period remains constant, which is consistent with the constant trend in cigarettes
sales over this period documented by Sloan, Smith and Taylor (2002).9 Third, among the more
educated, smoking shows an immediate decline in 1964 that continues so that by 1966 the
difference in smoking rates between HS drop outs and HS graduates is closer to 10 percentage
points.

9

Warner (1977) using data on cigarette sales predicts that in the absence of the 1964 Report, cigarette sales would
have increased over this period. He interprets the fact that they remained constant as evidence of a negative effect of
the 1964 Report on smoking.

11

Given that education is correlated with other characteristics such as income and cognitive
ability, we explore whether the observed relationship between education and smoking simply
reflects trends in these other underlying characteristics. To do so we plot trends in smoking for
low and high income mothers and low and high IQ mothers, defined as below and above the
median levels in the sample (Figure 2). We observe no trend breaks in smoking around 1964
associated with either income or cognitive ability. Moreover, both income and cognitive ability
are positively correlated with smoking, reflecting the fact that cigarette smoking in the 1950s and
1960s was more prevalent among those of higher socio-economic status during this time period,
though that is no longer the case.10

Regression Results – OLS/ Regression Discontinuity Specification
To control for any changes in the composition of pregnant women before and after 1964 that
could explain the trends in Figures 1A and 1B, we present results of a regression discontinuity
analysis of the impact of the 1964 SG report on both prenatal smoking and newborn health. We
estimate two specifications: a change in intercept (means) and a change in slope (rates). For the
former, we estimate the following equation:
Y= β1education + β2 education*post SG + β3 education*year + β4 education*year2
+ β5 year + β6 year2 + β7 post SG + β8X + β9AMC + β10Tax +ε

In the above specification, Y is either smoking (smoker, cigarettes per day) or a measure of
newborn health (birth weight and fetal death). We include as regressors maternal education and

10

Cognitive ability is available for less than half the sample and only very few mothers in 1959 or 1966 have
information on cognitive ability so we combined observations for these years with 1960 and 1965, respectively.

12

its interaction with ―post SG‖ (an indicator equal to 1 for years 1964-1966, after publication of
the SG report, and 0 for years 1959-1963, before publication of the report). To allow for a time
trend in the education gradient in smoking (or health) we include maternal education interacted
with a quadratic time trend (education*year and education* year2). The main effects (year,
year2, post SG) and a vector of personal characteristics including maternal race, age, family
income, birth order, and offspring gender are also included as is a fixed effect for the academic
medical center (AMC) in which the woman delivered as well as the real tax rate on cigarettes.
The results suggest that the education gradients in smoking and birth weight increase
substantially after publication of the First SG Report on Smoking and Health (Table 2). Before
publication of the report, an additional year of education was associated with a 1.4 percentage
point decline in the probability of smoking. After 1964, this increases significantly by 50
percent from 1.4 to 2.0 (column 1). If we look at cigarettes per day, we see that before the 1964
report, an additional year of education was associated with smoking .3 fewer cigarettes per day,
after the report, it increases by one third to .4 fewer cigarettes per day (column 2). Finally in
column 3, we present estimates of the impact of the SG report on the gradient in newborn health
as measured by birth weight. Before publication of the report, an additional year of schooling is
associated with heavier birth weight (24 gram difference). After the report, this increases by 25
percent to 30 grams, though the difference is not significant. Likewise, the gradient in LBW and
fetal death increase after 1964, but not significantly. When the sample is expanded to include the
full sample (which includes women younger than 19 and older than 34), estimates of the impact
of the 1964 Report on the gradient in birth weight and fetal death become significant (columns 68). Specifically, the gradient in birth weight increases 32 percent after the 1964 Report and the
probability LBW by 25 percent. For fetal death, there is no significant education gradient prior

13

to 1964. After 1964, an additional year of schooling is associated with a .2 percentage point
reduction in fetal death (baseline rate of fetal death in this sample is 3 percentage points).
Though we include multiple maternal characteristics that might explain the relationship
between maternal education and smoking or birth weight in the above analysis, in Table 3 we
present the results of an analysis in which we allow the impact of all maternal characteristics (not
just education) to change after the report. Specifically, we present the results of separate
regressions of smoking/newborn health on maternal education and other characteristics from the
period just before (1962-1963) and just after (1964-1965) publication of the Report in the first
two columns of Table 3. The negative relationship between maternal education and smoking as
measured by whether she smokes at all (Panel A) and cigarettes smoked per day (Panel B)
increases by one third after publication of the report. Before publication of the report, a standard
deviation increase in years of schooling (2.5 years) was associated with a 4 percentage point
decrease in the probability of smoking, and with smoking .9 less cigarettes per day. Immediately
after the report, this increased to a 5.75 percentage points and 1.2 fewer cigarettes per day. We
observe a very similar increase with respect to education and birth weight (Panel C). However,
this trend does not extend to heavy smokers defined as those smoking at least one pack of
cigarettes a day (Panel D) whose smoking habits do not change appreciably with the publication
of information on the ill-effects of smoking on health.
While the evidence thus far shows that women with more education responded immediately
to advances in medical knowledge in contrast to the less educated who did not, two questions
remain. The first concerns potential omitted variable bias. A priori we thought that the two
omitted variables most likely to bias the results would be income and cognitive ability, but
including controls for these two did not change the results. Though we cannot rule out other
14

unobserved characteristics that that might bias these results, the fact that including these two
characteristics, which one could argue are likely the most important, does not alter our results
suggests that other unobservables may not bias the results much.
A second concern is that the observed relationship between maternal education and smoking
merely reflects differences in reported smoking. This would be the case if more educated
women perceive a stigma associated with smoking after publication of the first Surgeon
General’s Report that less educated women do not, thereby differentially affecting their reports
of smoking. In panel E of Table 3 we present results for a small subset of the sample for which
we have third trimester serum cotinine levels. Cotinine and reports of cigarettes smoked per day
are highly correlated in these data (ρ=0.72). Regression results suggest that maternal education
is strongly and negatively associated with serum cotinine levels and that this relationship
increases 40 percent after 1964. After 1964, an additional 2.5 years of schooling is associated
with a 20 percent standard deviation reduction in serum cotinine levels. The stronger results for
serum cotinine are consistent with less educated under-reporting after the 1964 SG Report or
smoking cigarettes more intensely after the Report (see Evans and Farrelly, 1998.)
Next we estimate whether the 1964 report resulted in a change in the rate at which the
education gradient increased over this period. We refer to this as a change in slope model which
is specified as follows:
Y= γ1education + γ2 education*year*post SG + γ3 education*year2*post SG +
γ4 education*year + γ5 education*year2 + γ6 year + γ7 year2 + γ8X + γ9AMC +ε

Y can be an indicator variable for smoking, a count of the number of cigarettes smoked per day
or a serum cotinine level. The results (Table 4) suggest that the time trend in the education
15

gradient in smoking does increase significantly after the 1964 report. Prior to the report there is
no significant time trend in the education gradient in smoking (γ4 small and insignificant in all
specifications) but after the report, the gradient appears to increase in a linear fashion (γ2=-.004
for smoking, -.064 for cigarettes per day and -3.35 for cotinine, all significant). Results for
newborn health were not significant.
Finally, we explore how the education gradient in smoking (defined as cigarettes per day)
changes after 1964 using count models (a zero-inflated poisson due to over-dispersion in
cigarettes per day). The predictions are nearly identical to those based on linear models.
Based on these results, we conclude that immediately after publication of the first widespread
report about the effects of smoking on health, the negative relationship between maternal
education and smoking increased by one third and that this was not driven by differences in
income or cognitive ability. Nor does it reflect differences in reporting by education level.
Rather, the evidence seems to suggest that schooling itself affects the decision to smoke
presumably by reducing the costs of learning and/or acting on new knowledge. Moreover, this
increase in the gradient in smoking after publication of the report is accompanied by an increase
in the gradient in newborn health as measured by birth weight and fetal death.

Regression Results – Maternal FE Specification
To control for potential differences in any unobserved characteristics of pregnant women
before and after publication of the 1964 SG report, we limit the sample to mothers who had
multiple children over this period and include maternal fixed effects (n=17,287), thereby limiting
our comparison to the same women before and after publication of the 1964 SG report. This
16

would, for example, control for any differences in female education that may have coincided
with the 1964 Report. This might include passage of the 1964 Higher Education Act which
increased financial aid for higher education and Title I (1965) which increased federal funding
for schools serving low income children. For these regressions we include a linear time trend, an
indicator for post 1964 and maternal fixed effects. Moreover, we stratify the sample multiple
ways to assess whether the smoking decisions of some mothers were more responsive to
advances in medical knowledge than others.
On average, we witness a decline in the probability of smoking of 3.5 percent after
publication of the report (Table 5A, column 1, Panel A) and half a cigarette less per day (Panel
B). The decline in heavy smoking is insignificant. In columns 2 and 3 we stratify the sample by
maternal education (HS drop out vs. HS graduate). While the change in the probability of
smoking is similar for both groups, the decline in cigarettes smoked per day is twice as great for
HS graduates relative to HS drop outs.
We also explore whether other maternal characteristics such as income, maternal health
and health of previous children affect the decision to smoke after 1964. Income does not appear
to affect decisions to smoke after the 1964 report (columns 4 and 5). There is some suggestive
evidence, however, that maternal health and the birth weight of the previous child affect how a
mother responds to the 1964 SG report, though the estimates are very imprecise. Mothers
defined as ―not sick‖ (having no reported medical condition) are slightly more likely to reduce
their smoking relative to those defined as ―sick‖ (at least one medical condition), as are mothers
whose previous child was born of normal weight relative to those whose previous child was born
low birth weight (LBW).

17

Alternatively, for the sample of women with at least one birth before 1964 and at least
one birth after 1964, one can characterize women who quit, women who start and women with
no change after the 1964 Report (Table 5B). Women who quit are less likely to be black, more
likely to be white, are more educated, and have higher income than those who start smoking over
this period. They are very similar, however, to those whose smoking behavior does not change
over this period. It is the women who start smoking over this period who are significantly more
disadvantaged.

The Role of Peers
We explore whether peers may act as a social multiplier in either the diffusion and/or
uptake of new medical knowledge. Specifically, we hypothesize that having more educated
peers increases the probability of quitting (or not starting) after publication of the 1964 SG report
via two potential channels. First, more educated peers can serve as an additional indirect source
of information about the health effects of smoking (an information channel). This assumes that
the probability of knowing about the effects of smoking directly from 1964 SG Report increases
in education but is less than 1 and that peers can also transmit this information indirectly to each
other. As such, the probability that one knows about the effects of smoking on health is higher
for the more educated not only because they are more likely to have direct knowledge from the
SG Report, but also, if there is sorting on education, because their peers are more likely to have
that knowledge and transmit it to them. We refer to this as the information channel. The second
mechanism assumes that the cost of quitting, conditional on having information about the ill
effects of smoking, is lower among those whose peers do not smoke.11 As such, having more
educated peers who are themselves less likely to smoke after publication of the report, increases
11

This is consistent with the cue theory of consumption (Laibson, 2001).

18

one’s own probability of quitting and/or not starting. We refer to this as the behavioral
channel.12
If peers do serve as a social multiplier in the diffusion and/or take-up of new medical
knowledge, then the education gradient in smoking should increase more after the 1964 Report
among those groups characterized by a high degree of residential segregation by education. 13 To
examine this empirically, we calculate a dissimilarity index for each of the 11 cities included in
the NCPP based on 1960 census data. The dissimilarity index measures the degree of residential
segregation in the city and is defined as follows:

Where dropouti refers to the number of HS drop outs in the census tract (i), DROPOUT refers to
the number of HS drop outs in the city, gradi the number of HS graduates in the census tract and
GRAD the number of HS graduates in the city. To identify education segregation separate from
racial segregation, we calculate a separate index for each racial/ethnic group in each city (white,
black, Hispanic). We then stratify the sample based on low vs. high dissimilarity index (cutoff at
the median in the sample) and estimate separate regressions of the impact of the 1964 SG Report
on the education gradient in smoking for those more vs. less segregated.
We specify both change in intercept (maternal education *post 1964) and change in slope
(maternal education*post 1964*year) empirical models. We consider that segregation could be
12

Lleras-Muney and Jensen (2010) find that a randomized intervention in the Dominican Republic that increases
schooling reduces smoking among 18 year olds and that the effectiveness was due, in part, to changes in peer
networks.
13
This assumes that the educated residing in segregated cities are more likely to interact with educated peers than
those in less segregated cities. Likewise, the less educated residing in segregated cities are less likely to interact with
educated peers than those in less segregated cities.

19

endogenous in this context because mothers who select to reside in more segregated cities may
differ in unobserved ways from those choosing less segregated cities. We argue, however, that
these regressions are identified for the following reasons. First, to address concerns that more
segregated cities differ in important ways that might also affect smoking, we include city fixed
effects. Second, we also allow the smoking behavior of the more (or less) educated to differ by
level of segregation. As such, identification in this model comes from the change in smoking
behavior by education by level of segregation over time. Any threat to identification would have
to come from an omitted variable that varies with the level of education, the level of segregation
and the timing of the 1964 Report.
We find that the education gradient in smoking increases much more quickly after the
1964 Surgeon General’s report among those most segregated by education (Table 6). For
example, those with four more years of schooling reduce their probability of smoking by nearly
four percentage points after the 1964 SG Report in segregated areas, while mothers with the
same level of education in less segregated areas reduce their smoking by less than one
percentage point and the coefficient on the latter is not statistically significant. We take this as
evidence that peers serve as a social multiplier in either the diffusion of new medical knowledge
and/or the ability to act on such knowledge.

Summary and Interpretation of the Short Run Effects of Information on the Gradient
We conclude based on the results presented thus far that 1) the education gradient in
smoking increased immediately after the 1964 SG report and that the gradient continued to
increase further still in the two years after for which we have data, 2) this increase did not simply
reflect changes in reports of smoking, but actual smoking as measured by serum cotinine levels,

20

3) the observed negative relationship between education and smoking does not reflect differences
in income or cognitive ability, 4) the trend in the education gradient in smoking is consistent
with observed changes in the education gradient in knowledge about the negative effects of
smoking on health between 1957 and 1969, 5) peers affect the response to new knowledge about
the health effects of smoking, and 6) the education gradient in newborn health, as measured by
birth weight and fetal death, likewise increased after the 1964 SG report.
How do we interpret these findings? Should we interpret them as causal? While we do
not instrument for education, we could argue that IV estimates would likely be similar to OLS
estimates for the following reasons. First, we are able to control for the two largest potential
sources of omitted variable bias: income and cognitive ability. Second, existing IV estimates of
the impact of education on smoking using various instruments are very similar, though slightly
larger, than OLS estimates (eg, Currie and Moretti, 2003).
Alternatively, we could argue that a causal interpretation of the relationship between
education and the response to information is not crucial. Rather, the objective of this research is
to explore how new medical knowledge affects disparities in health – over the short and long
term. We focus on education because the more educated are better able to process new
information. This may be because education improves this ability or because the more able
pursue more education. From the perspective of this research, the distinction is not crucial.

IV. The Evolution of the Education Gradient in Smoking and Health

21

Having shown that publication of the First SG Report on Smoking and Health in 1964
resulted in an immediate increase in the education gradient in smoking and newborn health, we
examine how the gradients in both smoking and health have evolved over time.
A. Data
For this analysis we use multiple sources of data. Vital statistics does not include
information on smoking during pregnancy until 1989, so for years prior to 1989 we use data
from the National Natality Surveys (NNS) of 1969 and 1980. The NNS were conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics which randomly sampled certificates of live birth and
mailed questionnaires to 3,611 new mothers with births in 1969 and 9,941 new mothers with
births in 1980. Data on demographic characteristics and birth weight came from birth certificates
and the maternal surveys solicited information on income smoking habits while pregnant. The
resulting sample, when weighted, is representative of the population of married mothers with US
citizenship. However, we conclude that the omission of single mothers and non-citizens from the
NNS data is unlikely to affect our results. 14

B. Results
Based on regressions of smoking on maternal education and additional controls (age,
race, marital status, birth order, child gender and state cigarette tax rates) for the period 1969 2006, we find that the education gradient increases until about 1990 when it begins to decline

14

In 1970 and 1980, approximately 88 and 73 percent of all births were to married US citizens, respectively,
suggesting small potential bias in estimates from 1969 but potentially more bias in 1980 as more women were
excluded. To address any potential bias caused by the omission of these two groups, we compare estimates of the
education gradient in birth weight from the NSS with estimates based on vital statistics data which is representative
of the entire population of births for 1970 and 1980. We find that they are very similar.

22

and continuities to do so until 2006, the most recent year for which we have data. Specifically, an
additional year of education is associated with smoking 0.21 fewer cigarettes per day in 1969,
0.48 fewer cigarettes per day in 1980, 0.45 fewer cigarettes in 1990, 0.22 fewer cigarettes by
2000 and returning to levels below initial 1969 levels by 2006 (.14 fewer cigarettes per day), the
most recent year for which we have data (columns 2,4,6,8,10 of Table 7). The education
gradient in any smoking is similar (columns 1,3,5,7,9 of Table 7). In the second panel we
examine the impact by HS degree and in the third we present the same results redefining
education as an indicator variable for being in the top 25 percent of the education distribution in
that year to account for the fact that the composition of women within education categories has
changed over time. Regardless of how we define education, we see the same pattern and
conclude that the education gradient in smoking which was relatively small prior to publication
of the 1964 SG report, widens over time until sometime between 1980 and 1990 when it begins
to fall, declining to levels below 1969 levels by 2006. This trend mimics trends in the education
gradient in knowledge about the negative effects of smoking on health presented earlier.15
Finally, we explore the implication of these results for the evolution of health disparities.
The results of regressions of birth weight on maternal education and other demographic
characteristics over time (Table 8) suggest that the education gradient in birth weight tracks the
education gradient in smoking quite closely. Visually, we can see this in Figure 3 where we
have plotted regression coefficients on maternal education from the birth weight and smoking
regressions from Tables 7 and 8. As the education gradient in smoking increases between 1969

15

To isolate the relationship between education and smoking separate from income, we can re-estimate the above
education gradient regressions conditioning on income for 1969 and 1980 (because the NNS data include income
that the vital statistics data do not). When we do, the education gradient in smoking increases slightly from -.21 to .28 in 1969 and from -.48 to -.54 in 1980, suggesting that the relationship between education and smoking while
pregnant is not operating through income, at least for this period.

23

and 1980, so too does the education gradient in birth weight. Likewise, as the gradient in
smoking declines between 1990 and 2006, so too does the gradient in birth weight.16
Yet many other things that likely affect the education gradient in birth weight (such as
expansions in Medicaid eligibility for pregnancy) are also changing over this period. As such,
any claim that the evolution of the education gradient in smoking can explain the evolution of the
education gradient in birth weight requires a negative causal impact of smoking on birth weight.
Though previous research has consistently produced estimates that are negative, the estimated
size of the effects has varied substantially with the estimation method used. Because of the
richness of our data and ability to estimate the impact of smoking on birth weight using multiple
identification strategies, we can 1) quantify the bias in OLS estimates due to selection and
measurement error, separately, 2) attempt to explain and reconcile the variation in existing
estimates, and 3) provide a new estimate of the impact of smoking on birth weight that corrects
for bias from both selection and measurement error.

V. Prenatal Smoking and Newborn Health
For this analysis we focus on birth weight as a measure of newborn health, not fetal death
which is too infrequent (0.03) to generate stable estimates, particularly with the reduced sample
for the fixed effect estimates. However, we acknowledge debate over the appropriateness of
birth weight as a measure of newborn health and the presence of evidence both for and against
it.17
16

This is consistent with Racine and Joyce (2004) who document a similar decline in the income gradient in birth
outcomes (LBW and mortality) in New York City over the period 1988 -2000.
17
For example, Almond, Chay and Lee (2005), using variation within twins for identification, find very small
negative effects of birth weight on short term health outcomes, with the exception of very low birth weights. Black,
Devereaux, and Salvanes (2007) and Oreopolis et al (2008) using the same identification strategy do find moderate
long term effects on IQ, income, education and welfare receipt.

24

Previous attempts to estimate a causal relationship between smoking and birth weight
have used multiple techniques to overcome potential bias from omitted variables and
measurement error in reports of smoking. These techniques have included maternal fixed
effects, propensity score matching, randomized controlled trials and IV, with the results varying
with the estimation method used.18 Studies using fixed effects (Rosenzweig and Wolpin, 1991;
Abrevaya, 2006) produce estimates that are smaller than OLS estimates. Those using propensity
score techniques produce estimates similar to OLS estimates (Almond, Chay and Lee, 2005) as
do those correcting for selection using the Heckman selection technique (Grossman and Joyce,
1990). Sexton and Hebel (1984) conduct a randomized controlled trial of a smoking cessation
program for pregnant women and find that women randomly assigned to the smoking cessation
program smoked less and delivered babies that weighed significantly (92 grams) more. The final
method, IV, produces estimates that are considerably larger than OLS estimates, with the highest
estimate nearly double that of OLS.19
Our contribution to the existing literature is to assess the bias in OLS estimates due to
selection and measurement error, separately. To do so, we exploit 1) the large number of
siblings in the data that allows us to include maternal fixed effects to address selection bias and
2) a subset of data with serum cotinine levels which allows us to address the issue of
measurement error in reports of smoking in an IV framework. We argue that a careful
comparison of the OLS, FE and IV estimates allows us to 1) determine the amount of bias due to

18

Another method used by Fertig (2009) is to compare OLS estimates of the impact of smoking on birth weight over
time to assess the degree of selection into smoking. This method assumes that negative selection into smoking has
grown over time and her finding that OLS estimates based on 1958 data from the UK are considerably smaller than
those based on 2000 data suggests that selection can explain a substantial portion of current OLS estimates.
19
Evans and Ringel (1999) use state cigarette taxes as instruments for smoking while pregnant, yielding IV
estimates of 350-600 grams. Lien and Evans (2005) using the same technique but a limited sample yields a smaller
IV estimate of 189 grams. Finally, Permutt and Hebel (1989) using data from the 1984 randomized control trial for
smoking cessation during pregnancy and instrumenting for smoking status using the randomization, estimate that
smoking reduces birth weight by 430 grams.

25

selection and measurement error, respectively, 2) produce an estimate that adequately accounts
for both and 3) explain the variation in existing estimates.

A. OLS Estimates
OLS estimates suggest that smoking is associated with a decline in birth weight of 187
grams, or 28 percent of a standard deviation (Table 9). Defining smoking as cigarettes smoked
per day, we find that each cigarette smoked per day is associated with a reduction in birth weight
of 20 grams, and the relationship is decreasing in the number of cigarettes smoked (Column 1,
Panel B). In panel C, we explore this non-linearity and categorize women as non-smokers
(omitted), light smokers (1-10 cigarettes per day), moderate smokers (11-20 cigarettes per day)
and heavy smokers (more than 20 cigarettes per day). Light smokers deliver babies that are on
average, 128 grams lighter, while moderate and heavy smokers deliver babies that are nearly 300
grams lighter (43 percent of a standard deviation).
We repeat the analysis defining the birth outcome as a LBW birth and find that smokers
are 6 percentage points more likely to have a LBW birth (column 4) which represents a 50
percent increase and that the relationship is again concave in cigarettes smoked per day: light
smokers face a 4 percentage point increase in the probability of a LBW birth, and moderate and
heavy smokers face between a 7.4 and 8.8 percentage point increase.
We also explore whether smoking is correlated with prematurity and find that it is,
though the relationship is much weaker than with birth weight. Smokers deliver on average 2
days earlier (Table 9 column 6) and like birth weight, there seems to be a concave relationship
between number of cigarettes smoked per day and gestation at birth. When we define the
outcome as premature (delivery before 36 weeks gestation), we find that smokers face a 2
26

percentage point increase in the probability of delivering prematurely (the average probability of
prematurity is 16 percent in this sample).

B. Fixed Effect Estimates
To assess the extent of selection bias in OLS estimates, we include maternal FE, thereby
reducing identifying variation in smoking to that between births to the same mother. The sibling
subsample (n=16,483) used for the FE analysis is very similar to the full sample along nearly
every dimension including income, education, race, smoking habits and birth outcomes
(Appendix Table 1). For purposes of comparison and to assess generalizability of the fixed
effect estimates that are based on a subset of the full sample, OLS estimates of the impact of
smoking on birth weight based on the sibling subsample are presented in column 2 of Table 9.
They are very similar to the OLS estimates based on the full sample, suggesting that the FE
estimates are likely generalizable to the full sample. It should be noted, however, that the
variation in smoking declines considerably when we limit our analysis to that within mothers.
For example, the standard deviation in the number of cigarettes smoked per day is 9.5, overall
(the mean number of cigarettes smoked per day is 6.5). Within mothers, there is still some
variation, but considerably less with the standard deviation falling to 3.0.
When we include maternal fixed effects, the coefficient on smoking declines by two
thirds from -175 to -58 (Table 9 column 3), suggesting that once we control for omitted
variables, smoking reduces birth weight by less than 60 grams or 9 percent of a standard
deviation. Smoking an additional cigarette per day reduces birth weight by 12 grams, relative to
the OLS estimate of 20 grams, with the effect decreasing in the number of cigarettes smoked
(Table 9 column 3, panel B). Women who smoke more than 10 cigarettes per day on average
27

can expect newborns weighing 125 grams fewer (19 percent of a standard deviation), which is
half the OLS estimate, but still represents a moderate effect. The decline in the estimated
impact of smoking on the probability of a LBW birth when fixed effects are included is similar
to the decline in the birth weight regressions but are not significant due, perhaps, to the low
probability of LBW and relatively small sample size.
Interestingly, when fixed effects are included in the regressions estimating the
relationship between smoking and gestation/prematurity, the point estimates do not decline at all,
and in some cases actually increase, though they become imprecise, suggesting that selection
bias may be less of an issue in estimates of the impact of smoking on gestation/prematurity. 20

C. Measurement Error in Smoking Reports
To assess potential measurement error in these data we instrument for maternal smoking
with a measure of serum cotinine from the third trimester of pregnancy. This measure is highly
correlated with reports of maternal smoking but it is also correlated with any unobservables that
may be correlated with both smoking and newborn health. As such, this instrument only
addresses bias due to measurement error in reports of smoking, it does not address bias due to
selection into smoking.
Comparison of results from OLS, FE and IV regressions enables us to assess the extent of
bias in the OLS estimate due to omitted variables and measurement error, respectively and to
adjust (upwards) our FE estimate to account for measurement error in smoking. OLS results in
Table 10 columns 1 and 2 based on the full and sibling subsample suggest that each additional
20

Without conditioning on gestation, a standard deviation increase in cigarettes smoked per day, 9, reduces birth
weight by 14 percent of a standard deviation, while the same increase in cigarettes smoked per day reduces birth
weight conditional on gestation by 8 percent of a standard deviation.

28

cigarette smoked per day reduces birth weight by 11.7 grams. 21 The fixed effect estimate in
column 3 is much smaller, -3.7. Columns 4 and 5 contain the first and second stages,
respectively, of an IV regression. Cotinine is a very strong predictor of reported smoking (t
statistic = 31). However, we do not interpret the cotinine measure as the ―true‖ measure as it is
also subject to measurement error. Specifically, it is a single spot measure that reflects only
relatively recent smoking which may or may not be the average level. Moreover, it can also
reflect second hand smoke.
When we do instrument for reports of smoking with cotinine, the resulting IV estimate is
much larger than the OLS estimate: -18.6 vs -11.7, yielding a reliability ratio of 0.63 in the
measure of smoking and suggesting that measurement error in smoking leads to a considerable
downward bias in the OLS estimate. As previously noted, attenuation bias due to classical
measurement error is exacerbated in a fixed effect setting (Grilliches, 1979) with this
―exacerbation‖ increasing in the degree of correlation in the smoking reports of siblings which in
this case is high (ρ=0.77). It should be noted that the greater impact of smoking instrumented
with cotinine does not reflect the fact that conditional on smoking, those with a higher cotinine
levels suffer worse birth outcomes. The estimated direct impact of cotinine on birth weight is in
fact slightly smaller than the estimated impact of reported smoking (Appendix Table 2A).22
Based on this, we conclude that OLS estimates are biased upward by 59 percent due to
negative selection into smoking and biased downward by 37 percent due to classical
measurement error. On net, the results suggest that OLS estimates are biased upward by 22
percent. Moreover, we can calculate a causal estimate that accounts for both selection and
21

We exclude the quadratic term because we have only one instrument.
We also regress birth weight on ln(cotinine) separately by maternal education, income and the Duncan SES index
as a means of exploring selection into smoking. If there’s no selection, the effect of cotinine should not vary by type
of mother. We find that the estimated effects do vary across these types, consistent with non-random selection into
smoking. We thank Ted Joyce for this suggestion.
22

29

measurement error by adjusting the fixed effect estimates for classical measurement error in
smoking. When we do, we find that smoking results in 9.6 fewer grams at birth per cigarette
smoked per day and -152 grams for smoking, representing a moderate effect.
As a final identification strategy, we instrument for maternal smoking using the
publication of the 1964 report interacted with maternal education as an instrument.23 This
instrument is designed to mitigate bias from both measurement error and selection. The results of
the first and second stages are presented in the last two columns of Table 10, respectively. The
first stage is strong (t statistics of 5 and 6). As expected, the point estimate for smoking in the
second stage (-15.6 for cigarettes smoked per day and -311 for smoking) falls between the fixed
effect and IV estimates based on cotinine, reflecting the fact that this second IV estimate corrects
for both measurement error and selection. However, the coefficient is imprecisely estimated and
the 95 percent confidence interval includes a wide range.
We draw four main conclusions based on these analyses. First, OLS estimates of the
impact of smoking on birth weight are biased upward due to negative selection into smoking and
biased downward due to classical measurement error in smoking reports; second, fixed effect
estimates which correct for selection bias are significantly attenuated by measurement error;
third, a comparison of OLS and IV estimates based on cotinine suggest a reliability ratio of .63 in
reports of prenatal smoking (cigarettes/day); fourth, the true causal estimate of smoking on birth
weight corrected for selection and measurement error represents a moderate effect: -152 grams
for smoking and -9.6 grams per cigarette/day.
This analysis can help to explain the substantial variation in existing estimates that are
based on different estimation methods. With respect to the existing fixed effect estimates, we

The two main effects, publication of the report and maternal education, are included in the first and second stages
of the IV regression (eg, they are not excluded as instruments but rather are allowed to affect birth weight directly).

30

conclude that they are too small because of exacerbated measurement error. This also explains
why estimates based on propensity score and selection correction, which are subject to less
measurement error (though still some), are larger than the FE estimates and why IV estimates
which correct for selection and measurement error are larger still.

VI. Conclusions
The goals of this paper were threefold. First, using the only dataset that, to our
knowledge, has information on smoking habits before and after the first wide-spread publication
of the effects of smoking on health in 1964, we explored the immediate impact of the 1964
Report on the education gradients in smoking and health. We found that more educated women
immediately reduced their smoking in response to the report while the least educated did not.
These differences are consistent with an increase in the education gradient in knowledge about
the effects of smoking on health also observed over this period and cannot be explained by
differences in income or cognitive ability, nor differences in reported smoking as differential
declines in serum cotinine levels were also observed. Moreover, we provide evidence of strong
peer effects in the response to information. The immediate increase in the gradient in smoking
after 1964 was accompanied by an immediate increase in the gradient in newborn health as
measured by increases in birth weight and reductions in fetal death.
Second, we examined the long-run effects of an advance in information on the gradient in
smoking and health. We showed that the education gradient in smoking which increased
immediately after 1964, continued to increase until the mid 1980s when it began to decline as the
smoking behavior of the less educated began to converge to that of the more educated. This
trend in the education gradient in smoking witnessed over the past half century was mirrored by

31

trends in the education gradient in birth weight which initially increased after the 1964 report,
and likewise, beginning in the mid 1980s, began to decline.
Finally, we provided new evidence on the impact of smoking on newborn health using
FE and IV techniques that allowed us to assess the degree of measurement error and selection in
smoking reports separately and provide a causal estimate that is moderate in size and adjusts for
both sources of bias.
We conclude based on these findings that increasing health disparities is a likely
byproduct of advances in medical knowledge, which the more educated are quicker to adopt.
Moreover, the increase in inequality can persist to the next generation. However, over time, the
disparities decline as the behavior and health of the less educated eventually converge to that of
the more educated. Obviously, this does not imply that scientific progress should be eliminated
even though it will, at least initially, increase health disparities. It can, however, explain why
despite efforts to reduce inequalities in health, they continue to persist in an era characterized by
continuous advancements in scientific knowledge.
