INTRODUCTION

Wage indexation offers one solution to stabilizing an economy with labor
contracts which fix wages on the basis of lagged information.

Beginning with

the contributions of Gray (1976) and Fischer (1977), a number of studies have
examined how wages might be adjusted to current information in such a way as
to replicate a full information, frictionless economy-—one without wage

contracts. The objective of the indexation scheme, in effect, is to undo the
rigidities due to the contracts. One of the main conclusions of this
literature is that indexation of wages to prices is in general incapable of

replicating a frictionless economy. Full wage indexation to the domestic
price level will stabilize the economy against monetary disturbances, but may

accentuate the destabilizing effects of real disturbances. The optimal degree
of indexation, which depends upon the relative importance of real and monetary
disturbances, can at best minimize but not eliminate undesirable variations of
output.

Recent studies, however, have shown how it is possible for more complex

forms of wage indexation to replicate exactly a frictionless economy. Karni
(1983), for example, demonstrates that if the wage is indexed not only to
current prices, but also to current aggregate output, then it is indeed
possible to stabilize the economy perfectly relative to the frictionless

economy.1 The scheme, however, requires that information on aggregate output,
the crucial variable to be stabilized, be available

virtually instantaneously,

or at least within the time interval envisaged by the model. Such an
assumption may be reasonable if every firm in the economy is subject to the
same productivity disturbances, since then each firm would be able to infer
the size of the aggregate disturbances from those occurring at the individual

firm level. But if the productivity disturbances are at least partially firm—

specific, then the observations of any one firm give only partial information

about the aggregate disturbances. Moreover, if labor is less than perfectly
mobile between firms during the current period, then information about firm—
specific disturbances, rather than just aggregate disturbances, must be
incorporated in the indexation rule since wages in a competitive economy will
vary from one firm to another.

In this paper we offer two alternative approaches to stabilizing an
economy subject to firm—specific disturbances.

One approach relies on

privately-negotiated wage contracts which tie wages in each firm to firm—
specific variables, as well as to the price level. This indexation rule is

to Karni 's rule, except that the wage rate is tied to the output of
the individual firm, or equivalently1 to firm-specific disturbances, rather

analogous

than

to the aggregate output level.

As an alternative, we propose a taxation scheme to accompany a wage

indexation rule tying wages to prices alone. Like the more complex indexation
scheme, this combination of taxation and indexation enables the contract
economy to replicate output in the competitive, full information economy. The

tax is a levy on the net revenue of the firm with a corresponding tax

credit

for the employment of labor. It is designed to reduce the response of the
firm's demand for labor to changes in prices or productivity disturbances,
thereby mimicking the firm's output behavior in a competitive benchmark

economy. The essential feature of the tax

is

that it makes use of firm—

specific information, by inducing firms to modify their labor use in response
to a productivity disturbance, but does not require that wages be tied to any
firm—specific information.

Both of these schemes are viable as long as the firm—specific disturbance
is known to all agents, including labor and the government, as well as

—2—

firms. There is no particular need for the tax scheme in this case of
symmetric information since the privately-negotiated wage contract described

above is able to replicate the competitive, full information economy. If the
firm alone observes the productivity disturbance, however, then the tax scheme
plays a role in making the privately—negotiated contract incentive-.
compatible.

With asymmetric information, the firm has an incentive to

misrepresent current economic conditions. By doing so, it can reduce its wage
bill in the case of the indexation scheme or reduce its tax liability in the

case of the tax scheme. But, as we show below, a combination of the tax
scheme with the privately-negotiated contract not only succeeds in replicating
output in the competitive, full information economy, but also eliminates the

incentive on the part of firms to misrepresent. This incentive—compatible
scheme involves wage indexation to both the price level and the firm—specific
disturbance coupled with an appropriate taxation scheme on the firm's revenue.
In the case where the productivity disturbance is known only to firms,

departures from Pareto optimality can occur due to the incompleteness of

private markets. It is this which creates the potential for welfare—improving
government intervention. While our analysis shows that a tax scheme can
improve welfare relative to an initial (incomplete) market situation, it sheds

no light on why markets are incomplete. Nor does our analysis explain why the
government has any advantage in improving welfare, since it does not explore
purely private contract schemes which might also restore the competitive
solution • 2

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes
a benchmark competitive economy, paying particular attention to the underlying

microeconomjc structure. The contract economy is discussed in Section 3. The
two partial schemes are discussed in Section 4, while the incentive-compatible

—3—

scheme is derived and discussed in Section 5. Our conclusions are given in
Section 6. The analysis can be thought of as applying either to a closed

economy or toa small open economy operating in a world in which domestic and
foreign goods are perfect substitutes. Only a modest modification is required
to extend the results to an open economy in which domestic and foreign goods
are imperfect substitutes.

2. A BENCHMARK COMPETITIVE BONOMY
We consider an economy consisting of K firms, each of which produces an

identical good by means of a Cobb-Douglas production function of the form

Y =

(L) e

(1)

and L represent the output and labor used by each firm, while v is a
productivity disturbance, which is assumed to be firm specific. We assume
that the firm can observe its own current output and can therefore observe the

value of the disturbance v when it occurs. Throughout Sections 2—4, v is
also assumed to be known to the labor employed by the firm and the government.
In Section 5 we assume that it is known only to the firm and discuss the moral

hazard problems this raises. In the absence of disturbances, the output of
the representative firm is

Y = (L1)10

(1')

where the subscript o denotes the stationary equilibrium. Linearizing the
production function (1) about the stationary level (1') we obtain an

expression for the percentage change in output as a function of the percentage
change in labor and the productivity disturbance3

—4—

y (1 —
where y (y — Y1)/Y1,

denote percentage changes.

We assume that workers are mobile between firms from one period to

another, so the wage paid in the stationary equilibriu (where disturbances

are absent) is the same across firms. We

assume, however, that because of the

significant costs of moving between firms, workers are immobile within the
period, so wages can vary from firm to firm ex post once the supply

disturbances are revealed to the firm. We believe this assumption is
preferable to the usual one of perfect

mobility between firms, which in the

presence of firm—specific disturbances requires an unrealistic degree of
interfjrm mobility within every period.4

In

an economy with spot labor markets, but with labor tied in the current

period to individual firms, each firm has an incentive to exercise monopsony
power over its labor. So the equilibriuni attained by such an economy will

not, in general, be Pareto optimal. The benchmark equilibrium to be used for
welfare comparisons, however, should be that of an economy where both firms

and labor behave competitively. So the equilibrium we describe below is one
in which each firm behaves as if it were competitive in the labor market.5

Later we shall describe indexationcum_taxatjon

schemes which achieve this

same Pareto optimal equilibriu.

economies is identical.

3. CONTRACT EXONOMY
The economy we wish to analyze differs from the benchmark economy

described in the previous section in one

crucial respect. The wage is set in

a contract at the beginning of the period, before any disturbances are

known. As

in other

contract models, this contract wage is chosen so as to

clear

the market at the price expected at the beginning of period t, on the

basis

of previous information.
Because of the existence of contract lags, the nominal wage rate is

assumed to be indexed to variables known

currently. To reduce (and perhaps

eliminate) variations in real wages, nominal wages are indexed to the price

level, p.. Since wages are firm—Specific,

however, they may be indexed to

firm—specific variables as well as economy—wide variables. For the wage paid
to workers in firm i, the obvious

candidate is the output of firm i or,

equivalentlY1 the productivity disturbance

of firm i, v, which is observable

to firm i. So the indexation rule will take the form:

t and Et_ipt denotes the expected price level based on information

in the previous period, t-1. The parameters b1, b2 describe the

As an alternative to this indexation rule, we offer a tax on
the firm
which makes use of firm-specific information.

Our choice of such a taxation

scheme is governed by the need to affect supply behavior directly so as to

modify the individual firms response to

productivity disturbances. Each firm

That is, the wage rate should be fully indexed to the price level, but only

partially to the productivity disturbance. It is easy to understand why this
rule replicates the behavior of the frictionless economy. It keeps the
indexed wage equal to the wage found in the benchmark economy; c.f. (21) and
(5c)

By making use of both price and production information, (21) is analogous
to the rule recently proposed by Karni. (1983) for a closed economy. In a

—12—

model with economy—wide disturbances, Karni proposed indexing the (economywide) wage to-the level of aggregate output, which is assumed to be publicly

known, as well as the price level. In his model, such an indexation rule
eliminates all variations of aggregate output relative to that of the

benchmark economy because it duplicates the wage in such an economy. The same
argument applies here, except that we must tie the firm—specific wage to the
firm—specific output, or equivalently, to the firm-specific disturbance as in
(21)

B. Stabilization Through Indexation and Taxation
The indexation rule (21) gives rise to wage rates which are firm—

specific. Yet in many economies where wage indexation is practiced, the wage
is tied to some common price index, so that the indexation is uniform across

industries. This is the case, for example, in Australia. Thus as an
alternative to indexation based on firm-specific disturbances, in this section
we consider a tax scheme which, when combined with iridexation of wages to

prices alone, induces firms to produce at the same levels as in the benchmark

economy. The tax specified in Section 3 is levied on the individual firm.
Each firm makes its production decision based on the tax rate and the wage

rate which is tied through indexation to the price level alone. The
indexation parameter, b2, is therefore set to zero, so that the wage rate is
identical for all firms.

The optimal taxation and indexation parameters are obtained from (20a)

and (20b) for the case where b2 = 0:

The expressions for the optimal pair of taxation and indexation

rises or falls by the same amount in both equations. Thus a monetary
disturbance, which affects the labor market only through prices, leaves

employment, and therefore output, unchanged. Observe that the real wage is
affected, a point to which we shall return below.

Productivity disturbances have two-fold effects on the labor market

facing individual firms. To the extent that an increase in productivity is
economy-wide (Vt

> 0),

the wage and labor demand equations must both shift in

proportion to the resulting change in the price level. (The price level
falls, although the magnitude of the price adjustment cannot be determined

without introducing a demand side of the economy.) To the extent that the
firm itself experiences an increase in productivity (v =

e > 0), in

contrast, the labor demand curve alone is affected, shifting horizontally by

5. INCENTIVE-COMPATIBLE SCHEMES
In the previous sections we have assumed that the firm—specific
productivity disturbances are observed by all the agents in the economy.

Under this assumption either of the two schemes we have been discussing will

succeed in replicating output in the benchmark economy perfectly. In this
section we consider what happens when the firm alone observes its productivity

disturbance. We first show that the firm has an incentive to misrepresent
current conditions, in order to reduce its wage bill in the case of the

indexation scheme,9 or to reduce its tax liability in the case of the tax

scheme. We then show how a combination of the two schemes is incentive—
compatible by which we mean that there is no incentive on the part of the firm
to misrepresent the true disturbance.1°

We begin by illustrating the incentive to misrepresent a firm-specific

rise in productivity in firm i (v =

e).

We do this by comparing the profits

to the firm obtained by revealing the truth (which we call 'full disclosure')

with those obtained by not revealing the disturbance (which we label

'cheating'), Let the firm's net (after—tax) profits be written as a
percentage change from their stationary value as
expression (A.6) for

Using the

that expression the wage indexation rule (11'), we obtain the following

If the firm announces its productivity disturbance, then it must pay a higher
tax,

or pay its workers a higher wage, b2v, depending upon whether the

tax or the firm—specific wage indexation scheme is in effect.

If, on the

other hand, the firm decides not to reveal the disturbance, it can avoid the

higher tax or the higher wage, so that its profits are given by

(30)

is clear that as long as the productivity disturbance is positive, there is

an incentive not to announce productivity gains, whether the

tax

(at the rate

or the firm-specific indexation scheme (with indexatiori parameter b2) is in
effect.11 By the same reasoning, if the rise in productivity is economy-wide
(v =

vt),

then the firm will have an incentive to claim that the resulting

fall in prices is due to disturbances elsewhere in the economy. A firm could
claim, for example, that prices have fallen because of productivity
disturbances confined to other firms.
Since labor should be aware of these incentives to misrepresent, it will
be reluctant to enter into an indexation scheme of this type unless there is

some provision for monitoring the firm's productivity. Monitoring, in fact,
is sometimes found in profit-sharing schemes in the United States, where labor
is allowed to bring in independent auditors to verify a firm's profit

figures. Similarly, the government is unlikely to establish a tax scheme

—17—

unless some monitoring of the firm is possible. In either case, even if
monitoring is-feasible, it is likely to be costly to the economy.

Thus as an

alternative to these schemes which require surveillance, we now propose a
modification of the tax and indexation rules which eliminates the incentive to

cheat on the part of the firm. The necessary modification is suggested by
(30) above. Specifically, we need to combine the tax and indexation schemes

and to convert the tax into a subsidy ( <

— —(1

)b2

so that

(31)

< 0 ,

in which case the gain from misrepresenting current conditions is eliminated
entirely.
Of

course we still require the indexation and taxation parameters to

replicate the benchmark economy. Thus the combination of b1, b2, and , which
satisfy (20a), (20b), as well as (31) will succeed both in achieving the
stabilization objective and in inducing firms to reveal the truth. The unique
set of indexation and tax parameters which satisfies all three conditions
(20a), (20b), and (31) is given by

Since (20a) and (20b) are satisfied, all deviations of output from that in the

benchmark economy are eliminated. And since (31) is satisfied, there is no
incentive on the part of firms to misrepresent current conditions.
There are two features of this combined taxation and indexation scheme

which require further discussion. First, the indexation parameter for prices

—18—

(b1) is greater than unity so that wages are indexed more than proportionally

to prices. Second, the combined scheme does not necessarily duplicate the
income distribution found in the benchmark economy. However, by the
appropriate choice of a lump sum tax to finance the subsidy to firms, we can
ensure that after-tax wage income is proportional to prices, rather than being

and that the after-tax income distribution is identical to that
the benchmark economy, at least at the aggregate level. The subsidy to

of

firms must be financed by a lump sum tax on labor and firms proportional to

their

shares in nominal output, (1 - e) and

respectively.

and K is the number of firms.12 So their total after-tax income,

denoted by N1, can be expressed as a deviation from its level in a stationary
economy, as follows

as long as output is identical in the two
economies, the after-

tax wage income in the

contract economy is identical to the tax-free

wage

income in the benchmark economy.

Although aggregate after-tax income matches that in the benchmark
economy, the labor force in each firm does not receive the same income,

inclusive of taxes, as in the benchmark economy. Likewise, the income of each
owner of a firm differs in the two economies. So in order to achieve the same
consumption pattern as in the benchmark economy, we must assume that total
consumption

within

by labor (or owners) is independent

of the distribution of income

that class.15 By designing the taxes in this way, the government

avoids affecting the incentives of the individual firms in responding to firm—
specific disturbances.

6. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we have analyzed wage contracts in an economy with firm—

specific productivity disturbances. In the case where the disturbance is
known to all relevant agents we have

considered two alternative schemes which

achieve the same equilibri as in the competitive frictionless economy. The
first is a privately negotiated

wage indexation rule which ties wages in each

—21—

firm to the overall price level, as well as the firm-specific productivity
disturbance. -The indexation rule, which is analogous to Karni'S rule for an
aggregate economy, involves full indexation to prices and partial indexation

to the productivity disturbance. Secondly, we

have proposed a taxation scheme

to accompany a simpler form of wage indexation tying wages to prices alone and
have shown how this too can achieve the same objective.

The tax, levied on a

firm's revenue with a tax credit for labor use, modifies the firm's response

to the productivity disturbance, inducing

and depends upon just two parameters:

the firm to produce the same output
indexatiorl scheme is a partial one

(i) the supply elasticity of labor, and

(ii) the elasticity of labor in the production function. The tax rate depends
upon the same two parameters.

In the case where the productivity disturbance

is known to the firm

alone, we have shown that the firm has an incentive to misrepresent current

conditions. When taxes are combined with firm—specific wage indexation,
however, the incentive for the firm to cheat is eliminated. The tax must take
the form of a revenue subsidy to firms financed by a lump sum tax shared by
labor and firms in proportion to their contribution to total output. As
stated at the outset, our analysis does not explain the absence of complete
markets or why the government through this tax scheme has an advantage in
making privately-negotiated contracts incentive—compatible.
the case that a purely private contract can fulfill

It may well be

the same role. We leave

such an investigation for future research.
As a final point we may note that the results we have obtained can be
interpreted as applying either to a closed economy or an open economy under

purchasing power parity. The results are virtually unchanged in the case of
an open economy in which domestic and foreign goods are distinct. In the

—22—

latter case the same degree of indexatiori is applied to the CPI, rather than
to the domestic price level.

August 1984. We would like to thank Joshua A.izenman, Matthew

and an anonymous referee for helpful comments and suggestions.

1. Aizenman (1983) and Aizenman and Frenkel (1983) follow a different course
by analyzing indexation in economies where prices are currently

observable, but output is not. They show that indexation can eliminate
all variations in output relative to the full information competitive
economy except those due to disturbances unforecastable on the basis of
current information.
2

Several studies have investigated implicit labor contracts for the case

where firms have an informational advantage. (See, for example,
Azariadis and Stiglitz, 1983, and the papers cited there).

3. Of course (2) holds exactly, rather than as only a first order
approximation, if all lower case letters are interpreted as logarithms.
Working with percentage changes makes aggregation simpler.
4.

It would be even more preferable to model explicitly the costs associated
with short-run mobility, although this would complicate the analysis
considerably.

5. A competitive equilibrium would be attainable in a frictionless economy
without contract lags if the disturbances were common to a subset of
firms within which labor was mobile even within the period (such as firms

within a particular geographic area), as long as that subset is large
enough to ensure competitive labor market behavior.

6. McCallum and Whitaker (1979) analyze the stabilizing effects of an income
tax

which acts as a built-in stabilizer for aggregate output. Although
—24—

our tax also acts as a built—in stabilizer, it is levied on the revenue
of firms-rather than on income, and therefore

modifies supply rather than

demand behavior. Because it affects the supply behavior of firms, it is
able to undo the distorting effects of the labor contracts on the output
of individual firms.

in countries such as Japan as well as in specific industries in the
United

States, such as investment banking. Bonus schemes, however, are

typically asymmetric in not penalizing workers in bad years.

8. The above argument establishes that the taxation—indexation scheme
succeeds in replicating output in the benchmark economy. Using the same
argument as that developed in Section 5 below we can show that by an
appropriate lump sum rebate of the tax we are able to restore

aggregate

wage income and profits to their respective levels in the benchmark
economy.

when fir are aware of real disturbances, but labor is not.
