Investor Overconfidence and the Forward Premium Puzzle

NBER Working Paper No. 15866
April 2010, Revised October 2010
JEL No. F31,G15
ABSTRACT
We offer an explanation for the forward premium puzzle in foreign exchange markets based upon
investor overconfidence. In the model, overconfident individuals overreact to their information about
future inflation, which causes greater overshooting in the forward rate than in the spot rate. Thus, when
agents observe a signal of higher future inflation, the consequent rise in the forward premium predicts
a subsequent downward correction of the spot rate. The model can explain the magnitude of the forward
premium bias and several other stylized facts related to the joint behavior of forward and spot exchange
rates. Our approach is also consistent with the availability of profitable carry trade strategies.

Introduction

Nominal interest rates re‡ect investor expectations about future in‡ation. If investors rationally forecast in‡ation, then (assuming perfect markets and risk-neutrality) currencies in
which bonds o¤er high nominal interest rates should on average depreciate relative to lownominal-interest-rate currencies.A strong empirical …nding, however, is that at times when
short-term nominal interest rates are high in one currency relative to another, that currency
subsequently appreciates on average (see, e.g., surveys of Hodrick 1987, Lewis 1995, and
Engel 1996). An equivalent …nding is that the forward premium (de…ned as the di¤erence
between the forward and spot exchange rates) negatively forecasts subsequent exchange rate
changes, a pattern known as the forward premium puzzle.1
The most extensively explored explanation for the forward premium puzzle is that it
re‡ects time-varying rational premia for systematic risk (e.g., Fama 1984). However, the
survey of Hodrick (1987) concludes that “we do not yet have a model of expected returns
that …ts the data”in foreign exchange markets; Engel (1996) similarly concludes that models
of equilibrium risk premia do not explain the strong negative relation between the forward
premium and the future exchange rate change for any degree of risk aversion, even when
nonstandard utility functions are employed.2 He therefore suggests that an approach based
upon imperfect rationality can potentially o¤er new insights into the puzzle.
We propose an explanation for the forward premium puzzle based upon investor overcon…dence about the precision of their information and beliefs. This form of overcon…dence (also
known as judgmental or calibration overcon…dence) has been documented in many studies
in the psychology of judgment and in experimental market studies (see, e.g., the surveys
of DeBondt and Thaler, 1995; Rabin, 1998; and Gri¢ n and Brenner, 2004).3 Empirically,
1

The average slope coe¢ cient in regressions of future changes in the log spot exchange rate on the forward
premium across some 75 published estimates surveyed by Froot and Thaler (1990) is 0:88.
2
For example, Bekaert (1996) …nds that his habit formation model would require unrealistically volatile
exchange rates to deliver exchange rate risk premia that are variable enough to explain the forward premium
puzzle. Verdelhan (2010) proposes a consumption-based model that can generate negative covariance between exchange rates and interest rate di¤erentials. Burnside et al. (2010), however, provide new evidence
suggesting that conventional models of time-varying exchange rate risk premia do not explain the forward
premium puzzle. Carlson, Dahl, and Osler (2008) and Burnside, Eichenbaum and Rebelo (2009) show that
a market microstructure approach can potentially shed light on the puzzle.
3
There is also evidence that individuals tend to display calibration undercon…dence about judgments in
easy knowledge domains, though this may be a mechanical e¤ect (Brenner et al., 1996). In any case, trying
to beat the market in speculative trading is a particularly di¢ cult task (according to the e¢ cient markets
hypothesis, an impossible one). The evidence for overcon…dence using other constructs, such as the ‘better
than average’ e¤ect, is more mixed (see, e.g., Moore and Healy 2008, Clark and Friesen, 2009). Recent

1

Biais et al. (2005) …nd that individuals who have greater judgmental overcon…dence experience poorer trading performance in an experimental …nancial market. Consistent with
the importance of judgmental overcon…dence, Froot and Frankel (1989) provide evidence of
overreaction in currency traders’expectations about future exchange rate depreciations. Furthermore, survey evidence indicates that currency market professionals tend to overestimate
the precision of their information signals (Oberlechner and Osler, 2008).
A growing analytical and empirical literature has argued that investor overcon…dence
explains puzzling patterns in stock markets of return predictability, return volatility, volume
of trading, and individual trading losses; Hirshleifer (2001) and Barberis and Thaler (2003)
provide recent reviews. If a systematic bias such as overcon…dence causes anomalies in
stock markets, it should also leave footprints in bond and foreign exchange markets. An
explanation for anomalies is more credible if it explains a wide range of patterns, rather
than being tailored to just one puzzle in one type of market.
In our model, overcon…dent individuals think that their information signal about the
future money growth di¤erential is more precise than it actually is. As a result, investor
expectations overreact to the signal. This causes both the forward and spot exchange rates to
overshoot their average long run levels in the same direction. The consumption price level and
the spot exchange rate are in‡uenced by a transactions demand for money, whereas forward
rates are additionally in‡uenced by speculative considerations, i.e., the expected return from
holding domestic or foreign bonds. In our monetary framework, which is conventional except
for the presence of overcon…dent investors, these considerations cause the forward rate to
overshoot more than the spot rate, which implies that the forward premium rises in response
to a positive signal. Later, the overreaction in the spot rate is, on average, reversed. The
rise in the forward premium is a predictor of this correction, and hence, on average (under
reasonable parameter values), is a negative predictor of future exchange rate changes.
Another feature of foreign exchange markets is that professional forecast errors, de…ned as
the di¤erence between the exchange rate realization and the exchange rate forecast, are negatively correlated with the forward premium (Froot and Frankel, 1989; Bacchetta, Mertens
and van Wincoop, 2009). Our model is consistent with this …nding if we interpret the professional forecasts as matching the expectations of investors in our model, because the forward
rate re‡ects investor expectations of the future spot exchange rate. Since these expectations
models have proposed rational explanations for why di¤erent overcon…dence measures vary di¤erently with
task di¢ culty (see, e.g., Moore and Healy, 2008; Benoit and Dubra, 2009).

2

and the forward rate overreact to information more strongly than the current spot rate, a
rise in the forward premium is associated with a negative forecast error.
The sign of the slope coe¢ cient in a regression of the future spot rate change on the
forward premium re‡ects two opposing e¤ects. Overreaction to signals, as described above,
favors a negative coe¢ cient. On the other hand, any foreseeable component in the money
growth di¤erential that is not subject to overreaction favors the forward premium positively
predicting future spot rate changes. This is the conventional e¤ect that makes the empirical
…ndings a puzzle.
Consistent with the data, we show that over short horizons the overreaction-correction
e¤ect dominates, but over long horizons the positive conventional e¤ect eventually dominates. Intuitively, over time mispricing in the spot exchange rate attenuates, whereas the
e¤ects of foreseeable di¤erences in expected money growth and in‡ation rates across countries accumulate. Thus, a distinctive feature of our model is that it explains evidence that
the forward premium regression coe¢ cients switch from negative to positive at very long
horizons (Chinn and Meredith, 2004).
There is a tendency for countries with high average interest rates relative to the U.S.
over long periods of time also to have high average depreciation relative to the dollar (e.g.,
Cochrane, 1999). Consequently, if average rates of depreciation against the dollar are regressed on average interest rate di¤erentials, the slope coe¢ cient in this cross-sectional regression is typically positive. Our model is consistent with this contrasting pattern in crosssectional versus time-series regressions. In our model, the long-run averages of the interest
rate di¤erentials and rates of currency depreciation between countries re‡ect average money
growth di¤erentials, and tend to average out the transitory e¤ects of mispricing. So the
cross-sectional regression behaves conventionally. In contrast, as we have discussed above,
mispricing plays a crucial role in the behavior of the time-series regression.
Our benchmark model assumes purchasing power parity (PPP), but the qualitative and
quantitative implications do not rely upon this assumption. In Section 5, we modify the
model to allow for deviations from PPP at the level of the aggregate consumer prices by
incorporating nontraded goods and sticky prices as in Calvo (1983). We …nd that the magnitude of the forward premium bias remains about the same for reasonable values of the
Calvo price stickiness parameter. The modi…ed model, however, has the desirable feature
that the price level does not overshoot its average long-run level in response to a signal about

3

future money growth di¤erentials.
Our benchmark model also assumes that monetary policy is characterized by exogenous
money growth. This allows us to capture the basic insight in closed-form. In reality, policy
makers adjust short-term interest rates in response to economic conditions. In Section 6, we
therefore characterize monetary policy as an interest rate rule. We show that if this rule is
incorporated in our sticky price model we still obtain downward forward premium bias so
long as there is overcon…dence, where the magnitude of the bias is increasing in the degree
of overcon…dence.
Several recent papers have provided insightful analyses of how investor irrationality can
potentially explain the forward premium puzzle.4 An early application of irrationality to
foreign exchange markets is provided by Frankel and Froot (1990a). In the model of Mark
and Wu (1998), distortion in investors’beliefs is exogenously speci…ed to occur in the …rst
moment of exchange returns: noise traders overweight the forward premium when predicting
future changes in the exchange rate. Gourinchas and Tornell (2004) o¤er an explanation of
the forward premium puzzle based upon a distortion in investors’beliefs about the dynamics
of the forward premium, but are agnostic as to the source of the distorted beliefs.5
Our paper di¤ers from past behavioral explanations for the forward premium puzzle
in possessing a combination of features: assumptions about belief formation based upon
evidence from psychology, explicit modeling of the belief formation process, and explicit
modeling of the equilibrium forward premium without making exogenous assumptions about
its dynamics.6 Furthermore, our approach provides a distinctive additional set of predictions
about the forward premium bias, and the psychological bias that we assume has been shown
to have realistic implications for security markets in general, not just the foreign exchange
market.
Speci…cally, we show that the average negative relationship between the forward premium
and future exchange rate changes is a natural consequence of a well-documented cognitive
4

Bacchetta and Wincoop (2007, 2009) propose a middle ground between behavioral and fully rational
risk-premium explanations for the forward discount puzzle. In their approach, the forward premium puzzle
can result from a combination of infrequent and partial information processing.
5
Gourinchas and Tornell (2004) assume that the forward premium follows a persistent process, but investors mistakenly perceive an additional transitory component in its dynamics. This distorted belief leads
the nominal exchange rate to underreact to interest rate innovations, which is opposite to the overcon…denceinduced overreaction in our model. Thus, the mechanism used by Gourinchas and Tornell (2004) to explain
the forward discount puzzle is di¤erent from that studied here.
6
McCallum (1994) also emphasizes the need for behavioral approaches to provide an underlying motivation
for their assumptions about the form of irrationality or noise trading.

bias— overcon…dence. We derive price relationships from investor beliefs, rather than directly making assumptions about trading behavior. Furthermore, we do not assume that
belief errors have a particular correlation with the forward premium, but rather derive this
correlation from the psychological premise.
Overcon…dence is not an ex post explanation chosen speci…cally to …t the forward premium puzzle. Investor overcon…dence has been used to explain a range of other crosssectional and time-series patterns of return predictability in securities markets as well as
patterns in volume, volatility, and investor trading pro…ts.7 Thus, our approach o¤ers a parsimonious explanation for a range of anomalies in asset markets, which helps avoid possible
concerns about over…tting the theoretical model to the anomaly being explained.
A common challenge to psychology-based approaches to securities markets anomalies is
to explain how irrational investors can have an important e¤ect on market prices if there are
smart arbitrageurs. In our setting, there is an opportunity for rational investors to pro…t from
the currency carry trade, a strategy that exploits the forward premium bias. This involves
borrowing money in a country with a low interest rate, and investing in another country with
a higher interest rate. However, the risk inherent in carry trades limits the extent to which
risk averse investors will engage in arbitrage.8 Uncertainty about a country’s in‡ation rate
is a systematic risk, so that even if the market prices re‡ect incorrect expectations, rational
investors are not presented with a risk-free arbitrage opportunity (on imperfect arbitrage of
systematic mispricing, see Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam, 2001).
Furthermore, the behavioral …nance literature o¤ers several reasons why irrational investors do not necessarily lose money competing with the rational ones, and why even if
irrational investors are prone to losing money, imperfect rationality can still in‡uence price.9
7

Individual investors trade actively and on average lose money on their trades, which is consistent with
overcon…dence (e.g., DeBondt and Thaler, 1985, Barber and Odean, 2000). Investor overcon…dence has been
proposed as an explanation for several patterns in stock markets, such as aggressive trading and high return
volatility (e.g., Odean 1998), price momentum, long-term reversals, and underreactions to corporate events
(e.g., Daniel, Hirshleifer and Subrahmanyam, 1998; 2001), return comovements (Peng and Xiong, 2006), and
speculative price bubbles (Scheinkman and Xiong, 2003).
8
Predictability in excess currency returns implied by the forward premium puzzle is low (with R2 typically less than 0:05) and largely overshadowed by uncertainty about future exchange rates (Bacchetta and
Wincoop, 2006). The carry trade entails substantial risk. For example, the carry trade of Goldman Sachs’
Global Alpha Fund between Japanese yen and Australian dollar led to major losses in August 2007.
9
Reasons why imperfectly rational investors may earn high expected pro…ts and/or remain important
include a possible greater willingness of overcon…dent investors to bear risk or to exploit information aggressively, limited investment horizons of the arbitrageurs, wealth reshu- ing across generations, and the
existence of market frictions. See Hirshleifer (2001) and Barberis and Thaler (2003) for discussions of these
issues.

5

For example, Biais and Shadur (2000) show that Darwinian selection does not eliminate
irrational traders.
In the foreign exchange context, even if less sophisticated currency users on average lose
relative to a set of smart speculators, less sophisticated individuals will still need to hold
money balances, so their money demands will still play a role in determining equilibrium
price levels and therefore spot and forward exchange rates. Hence, we do not expect complete
elimination of the forward premium bias. Froot and Thaler (1990) and Burnside et al. (2006)
provide evidence that market frictions and other practical constraints limit the pro…tability
of trading strategies designed to take advantage of the forward premium anomaly.

The Basic Idea

In foreign exchange markets, there is a need for subjective judgment in forecasting future
in‡ation, which creates scope for overcon…dence.10 To illustrate how overcon…dence a¤ects
the forward premium regression,

(1)

we now present a simple intuitive discussion that relies on risk neutrality and price dynamics that are typical in monetary models of the exchange rate. Figure 1 plots the path of
movement for the spot and forward exchange rates from date

1 to date 1, conditional on

a positive date-0 signal about the date-1 in‡ation di¤erential. For ease of presentation, we
assume that at date

1 the economy is in a steady state in which the expected future in-

‡ation di¤erential is zero, so that the spot exchange rate s coincides with the forward rate
f.
If there were no overreaction to the date-0 signal in the spot market, the spot exchange
rate would rise to sR
0 at date 0, and would be expected to rise further to the point labeled
E0R (s1 ) at date 1; the R superscript indicates values under rational beliefs. The two-step
increase in the exchange rate in response to news about future in‡ation is a standard feature
of rational-expectations-based monetary models. Under risk neutrality, if there were no
overreaction in the forward rate, it would be f0R = E0R (s1 ). The forward premium at

The existence of an active industry selling macroeconomic forecasts is consistent with our assumption
that at least some investors believe they can obtain high quality signals about future in‡ation. Previous
studies share our assumption that individuals believe they possess meaningful information signals about
aggregate macro-factors (e.g., Subrahmanyam, 1991).

f0R

R
sR
0 = E0 (s1 )

sR
0 > 0. In this environment the coe¢ cient in (1) would be one.

How can the coe¢ cient be negative? The answer lies in the fact that both the spot
and the forward exchange rates are market prices, each subject to its own misreaction.11
Overcon…dence causes investors to overreact to their date-0 signal about the future in‡ation
di¤erential, which drives the forward rate above the level predicted by rational expectations.
We illustrate this overreaction in Figure 1, by assuming that the date-0 forward rate rises
from f = s to f0 > E0R (s1 ). Meanwhile, such overreaction also causes the spot rate to
overshoot its rational level in the same direction, so that s0 > sR
0 . If investors are su¢ ciently
overcon…dent in the quality of their signals, the spot rate can overshoot its long-run average
level, s0 > E0R (s1 ), this being the case illustrated in Figure 1.12
In summary, there are two possibilities. In both cases, the monetary model predicts
that the forward rate overshoots more than the spot rate does in response to the positive
in‡ationary signal; i.e. f0

s0 > 0. In the …rst case, where investors have a modest degree

of overcon…dence, s0 overshoots the rational-expectations equilibrium price, sR
0 , but not the
long-run average level of the exchange rate, so that E0R (s1 )
coe¢ cient

1

s0 > 0. In this scenario the

in (1) is positive but less than one. In the second case, where investors have a

stronger degree of overcon…dence, s0 overshoots its average long-run level, E0R (s1 ), so that
E0R (s1 )

s0 < 0. In this case, the coe¢ cient

1

in (1) is negative. In the latter scenario, the

rise in the forward premium coincides with the overcon…dence-induced overreaction in the
spot exchange rate, but also predicts the subsequent correction in the spot rate. It is this
e¤ect that results in a negative slope coe¢ cient.

3

The Model

In the basic model we consider a general equilibrium setting in which representative individuals in two countries hold their respective national monies because domestic real money
11

The asset market approach to exchange rate determination has long recognized that exchange rate
movements are primarily driven by news that changes expectations (e.g., Obstfeld and Rogo¤, 1996, p. 529).
12
It is evident from this argument that if the spot rate did not overreact, the forward premium regression
coe¢ cient would be less than one, but could not be negative. This case can be likened to behavioral stock
market models in which the market-to-book ratio is a negative predictor of future returns. In this analogy,
the stock’s market price corresponds to the forward rate (which overreacts strongly), and its book value
corresponds to the spot rate (which does not overreact). This comparison indicates that we cannot fully
explain the forward premium puzzle unless we take into account a distinctive feature of the monetary setting,
the fact that the spot exchange rate (unlike book value) is a market price that itself can overreact.

The Individual’s Problem

We assume that the representative individual in the home country has additively separable
preferences over consumption and real balances, with instantaneous utility function

;

where ct is aggregate consumption, mt is the date t stock of real money balances, and % > 0
and

> 0 are constants.

We assume that a complete set of state contingent securities are available for sequential
trade. Let the individual’s net purchases of a claim to one unit of consumption at date t + 1
if state of the world zt+1 is realized be denoted at (zt+1 ), and let the date t price of this claim
be denoted qt (zt+1 ). Then the individual’s date t budget constraint is

history of events up to date t by z t

The stock of domestic money at date t is Mt . At date t, the domestic government creates
new money, Mt

this transfer is

it follows that

At each date t, the individual chooses ct , mt , a function at ( ), and contingency plans for

The foreign economy is symmetric to the domestic economy. In what follows, foreign

variables are denoted by an asterisk ( ). Individuals in the two economies have the same

probability distributions over events. First order conditions symmetric to (6) and (7) hold
in the foreign economy. We de…ne the growth rates of domestic and foreign money as

Empirical Predictions of the Model

We now explore several empirical predictions of the basic model. The central result is that
individuals’ overcon…dence causes the forward rate to overshoot more than the spot rate,
making the forward premium a measure of overreaction and a predictor of the subsequent
correction in the spot rate. We show that with su¢ cient overcon…dence, the model is consistent with a wide variety of empirical …ndings found in the literature.

4.1

forward premium regression, (1), are

Proof: See the appendix.
Proposition 1 shows that overcon…dence can explain the forward premium puzzle. When
there is no overcon…dence (i.e.,

= 0),

1

= 1,

0

(UIP) holds. When there is overcon…dence (i.e.,

= 0, and uncovered interest rate parity
> 0),

is less than unity and becomes

negative with a su¢ ciently high level of investor overcon…dence.
To understand the result, it is helpful to impose symmetry across the two money growth
processes. Assume, therefore, that

unity, which re‡ects the conventional force that drives the usual UIP result. The second term
re‡ects investor overcon…dence. The more overcon…dent investors are, the more negative the
relationship between the forward premium and the subsequent exchange rate depreciation.
If

1

13

To further understand Proposition 1 it is helpful to consider the responses of the domestic interest rate and the exchange rate to the arrival, at date 0, of a unit signal about
domestic money growth at date 1. We …rst consider the case where individuals have rational
expectations (

C

=

R

and

= 0). This is a case where UIP holds.

A unit signal shock at date 0 is any combination of u0 and

0

such that

0

= 1. Figure

2(a) illustrates the e¤ects of the signal shock for two such combinations.14 In the …rst
scenario, the signal is false (u0 = 0 and
is true (u0 = 1 and

0

0

= 1), whereas in the second scenario, the signal

= 0). Since individuals do not observe u0 and

0,

but know their

distributions, expectations can be calculated as if the two scenarios have probabilities 1
and

R 15

.

Thus, individuals expect domestic money growth at date 1 to rise by

R

R

. The

expectation of higher future money growth causes the demand for real money balances to
drop by

(1 + )

1

R

. Consequently, the domestic price level rises and, from (20), the

exchange rate depreciates by

(1 + )

1

R

.

At date 1, suppose the signal is revealed to be false. In this case, the price level and
exchange rate go back to their original levels by falling

(1 + )

1

R

. If, however, the

signal is revealed to be true, the price level and exchange rate go to their new long-run levels
(1 unit higher than their initial values) by rising a further 1

(1 + )

1

R

. Under rational

expectations, the expected change in the exchange rate from date 0 to date 1 is a weighted
average of these two possibilities:
R

E0R s1 = (1

R

By equation (18), the interest rate at date 0 rises by the same amount ^{0 =

:
R

=(1 + ): The

forward premium regression’s slope coe¢ cient is the ratio of these two expressions because
there are no expected deviations of the interest rate from its steady state value from date
1 forward, and no expected changes in the exchange rate from date 2 forward. The slope
coe¢ cient is, therefore, 1.
Now consider the case where individuals are overcon…dent, which is illustrated in Figure
2(b).16 In this case, we simply replace

R

with

C

in the above discussion. Thus, when

For the purposes of Figure 2(a), we set = 7 and R = 0:35.
Since u0 and 0 are normally distributed, the signal extraction problem faced by individuals implies that
when they see 0 = 1, they expect domestic money growth in the future to be higher by R = 2u =( 2u + 2 ).
This is equivalent to individuals believing that money growth will increase by 1 with probability R and by
R
0 with probability 1
.

coe¢ cient is negative.
The key factor driving the result in the overcon…dence case is that individuals’expectations put excessive weight on the quality of the signal. As Figures 2(a) and 2(b) illustrate,
the e¤ects of overcon…dence are twofold. First, the exchange rate overreacts to a signal at
date 0. Second, individuals put too little weight on the possibility that the exchange rate
will correct at date 1. The combination of these two e¤ects, when su¢ ciently strong, leads
to a negative slope coe¢ cient in the forward premium regression.
We illustrate the magnitude of the forward premium bias generated by the model using
realistic values for

and the overcon…dence parameter . The average

estimate for six

countries (Austria, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Poland, and Russia) in Table 3 of Cagan
(1956) is 5:36. Cagan’s estimate is relevant for our analysis, because, to …rst order, the
expression for money demand in our model, (18), is equivalent to Cagan’s. For the same six
countries, the average

estimate in Table 2 of Sargent (1977) and Table 1 of Goodfriend

(1982) are 4:1 and 3:7 respectively. Bailey (1956) uses

Barro (1970) theoretically argues and empirically supports the hypothesis that

estimates a money demand elasticity 0 = 0:05 using U.S. post-war data. Given a 5 percent steady state
interest rate, values of between 3 and 11 translate into values of 0 between 0:15 and 0:55.

15

For the overcon…dence parameter , we rely on Friesen and Weller (2006) who measure
the magnitude of analysts’ overcon…dence using earnings forecast data. They de…ne overcon…dence in the same manner as we do, and assume that analysts perceive the precision of

their private signals to be 1 + a times the true signal precision. That is,

vary considerably around this value. Figure 3 illustrates the magnitude

of the forward premium bias generated by our model. As Figure 3 shows, under realistic
parameter values (3 <

bias that closely matches the magnitudes observed in the data.

.

As in Froot and Frenkel (1989) we can decompose the change in the spot rate as
st+1 = EtC st+1 + st+1

EtC st+1 :

The …rst component, EtC st+1 , is individuals’forecast of the change in the spot rate. The
second component is individuals’ forecast error. By construction, the slope coe¢ cient obtained from the forward premium regression can therefore be interpreted as the sum of the
slope coe¢ cients obtained from regressing EtC st+1 and the forecast error separately on the
forward premium. This observation leads to the following proposition.
16

Proposition 2 When investors are overcon…dent, their prediction errors are negatively
correlated with the forward premium and account for all of the bias in the forward premium
regression.
Proof: The change of the exchange rate at date t + 1 is given by (21). It follows that
overcon…dent investors’forecast of the change in the exchange rate is
EtC st+1 =

The implication that forecast errors are negatively correlated with the forward premium

st+1

on the forward premium, where set+1 is the average investor forecast (based on survey data)
of the spot exchange rate at date t + 1. Froot and Frankel …nd that the slope coe¢ cient
in their pooled regressions is signi…cantly greater than zero; this …nding is robust across
surveys. Since the left-hand-side of Froot and Frankel’s regression equation is the negative
of forecasters’expectational error, this indicates that forecast errors are negatively correlated
with the forward premium.
st on the forward premium. Interpreting set+1

Froot and Frankel (1989) also regress set+1

as EtC st+1 , our model predicts that the slope coe¢ cient in this regression should be unity.
For seven out of the nine surveys reported by Froot and Frankel the slope coe¢ cient in this
regression is insigni…cantly di¤erent from one.18
4.2.2

Longer-Horizon Regressions

In Section 4.1, we show that there can be a negative relationship between the one-period
forward premium and the subsequent one-period change in the spot exchange rate. We now
examine the relation between the forward premium and the future spot rate change in a
longer-horizon regression. Speci…cally, we consider a regression of the n-period change in
the spot exchange rate st+n

st on the n-period forward premium fnt

18

st , where fnt is the

Frankel and Chinn (1993) …nd similar results using a broader set of individual currency pairs. For 24
out of 34 currency/time period pairs they report the slope coe¢ cient to be insigni…cantly di¤erent from one.

n-period forward exchange rate. We examine whether the slope coe¢ cient will be more or
less negative for n > 1 than for n = 1.
Proposition 3 In a regression of the n-period change in the spot exchange rate, st+n
on the n-period forward premium, fnt

the coe¢ cients in a regression of st+n

st

st .

Proposition 3 implies that when investors are overcon…dent, the n-period forward premium is still a biased predictor of the subsequent n-period exchange rate depreciation and
the degree of bias does not vary with the forward horizon.
This implication of Proposition 3 is consistent with empirical results obtained with n = 1,
3, 6 and 12 months. These are shown in Table 1. Although there is some variation in the
degree of bias, the average slope coe¢ cient in the regressions does not vary systematically
with the forward horizon. In fact, the typical slope coe¢ cient remains very close to

1 at

all forward horizons.
At much longer horizons of …ve and ten years, Chinn and Meredith (2004) …nd less
negative forward premium bias. Our model can easily accommodate Chinn and Meredith’s
…ndings if we generalize our assumptions about

t,

which is the di¤erence, across the two

countries, between the mean-zero unpredictable shocks to money growth. In particular, if
we assume that

t

is persistent, and has considerably less variability than

t,

we can easily

rationalize the stylized facts at both short and long horizons.
Proposition 4 If the shock to the money growth di¤erential,

t,

is a persistent AR(1)

process, with AR parameter , then the slope coe¢ cient in the n-period forward premium

We draw three main conclusions from Proposition 4. First, since $n > 0, as long as agents
are overcon…dent ( > 0) it follows that the slope coe¢ cient

n1

< 1 for all n. Second, if

> (1 + ) 1 , then, for any particular value of n, there is always a su¢ ciently small value of
var( t ), such that
that

n1

< 0. Third, when

> 0, $n is decreasing in n, implying, as asserted,

is increasing in n. Therefore, the amount of forward premium bias diminishes as

the investment horizon increases. In order for the value of

n1

to be negative and relatively

insensitive to n at short horizons, and yet be close to 1 at horizons of …ve to ten years, this
version of the model requires a value of

close to 1, and a very small value of var( t ) relative

to var( t ).
The reason that forward premium bias is less negative at longer horizons is that the
persistence in

t

produces a foreseeable component of money growth that strengthens over

time. This induces unbiased predictability in st+n

st that eventually dominates the short-

term (and biased) predictability that derives from the innovation

set of 11 developed country currencies over the period 1983–2008. As McCallum points out

Given that the variance of

for the currencies in our sample, it is not surprising that the coe¢ cient in the regression
approaches unity as n increases. For similar reasons, the R2 ends up being close to n=(n + 1).
In our model, the results for these regressions depend not only on the degree of overcon…dence, , and the interest elasticity parameter,
predictions we set

becomes closer to one, although in the model it approaches from below one while in the data
it approaches from above one for most currencies.
4.2.4

The Superiority of the Forward Premium Regression as a Predictor of
the Future Spot Rate

In our model, the forward premium predicts exchange rate changes both for the traditional
reason that it contains information about the future money growth di¤erential, and for
the reason that it contains information about spot rate mispricing. Therefore, the forward
premium regression provides one method of forecasting the future value of the spot exchange
rate. Similar reasoning implies that regressions based on the realized in‡ation di¤erential,
or the latest changes in the spot rate or forward rate, might also be useful for predicting
future exchange rates. We also consider whether the current forward rate, or the current
spot rate, is the best predictor of the future spot rate. We show that the forward premium
regression provides a better predictor of the subsequent spot rate, in terms of mean squared
error, than any of the alternatives.
Proposition 5 In the model, the forward premium regression provides a minimum mean
squared error predictor of the subsequent exchange rate. It dominates alternative predictors
suggested by our model (regressions based on the in‡ation di¤erential, or the latest changes
in the forward rate or spot rate, or the simple levels of the current forward or spot rates).
Proof: The proof of the …rst part of the proposition is straightforward. Given our results, we
20

can write

st+1 =

t+1

+ ut +

t+1 .

Since ut is not observed at time t, and EtR ut =

R

t,

we can write
st+1 = (
where wt+1 =

t+1

+

t+1

R

+ ut

t

is a variable xt , such that xt = ax
has slope coe¢ cient (

is orthogonal to time-t information. Suppose there

for some scalar ax 6= 0. A regression of

)=ax and the forecast of

st+1 generated by xt is (

st+1 on xt
R

) t.

Therefore, the forecast error associated with this forecasting rule is wt+1 . No other forecasting
rule can improve on this result given that (24) holds, and wt+1 is unpredictable. Since
ft

st = ( = ) t , the forecasts generated by the forward premium regression are minimum

mean squared error forecasts. The proof of the second part of the proposition is provided in
the appendix.
Intuitively, the only information that is useful in forecasting the exchange rate is
and the forward premium is linked one-to-one with

t.

t,

The reason for the second part

of the proposition is that the regression-based alternative forecasts contain noise from the
viewpoint of predicting exchange rate changes. These forecasts are linear combinations of
and extraneous noise, such as

t.

t

Using the current forward (spot) rate as the forecast of the

future exchange rate is suboptimal because it is equivalent to using the forward premium
regression to forecast, while imposing the false restrictions that

0

= 0 and

1

=1(

1

= 0).

The model’s predictions correspond reasonably closely to empirical …ndings based on
our 11-country sample. The calibrated version of the model described above predicts that
there are only modest di¤erences in the accuracy of the di¤erent forecasting methods, because
variability in

st+1 is dominated by unpredictable components. In particular, the calibration

of the model given in Section 4.2.3 implies that the forward premium regression has a root
mean squared error (RMSE) of 2:89 percent, while the regressions based on the change in
the forward and spot rates have RMSEs of 2:96 and 2:95 percent, respectively. Using the
current forward and spot rates as the forecasts of st+1 leads to RMSEs of 2:93 and 2:90
percent, respectively. These values are all close to their empirical counterparts in Table 3,
which shows the RMSE associated with each of the forecasting methods. Consistent with
the model, the forward premium regression typically provides the most accurate forecast.

Cross-Sectional Regressions

Suppose that

st+1 and ft

st are averaged over many time periods. When the steady state

money growth rates are di¤erent in countries i and j but the shock processes are identical
and independent of one another, it follows from (21) and (22), that in very large samples
sij = f

sij =

ij ,

where

ij

is the steady state money growth rate di¤erential between

the two economies. Hence, in a cross sectional regression where the individual observations
are pairs of

sij and f

sij for individual pairs of countries, i and j, the slope coe¢ cient

obtained will be one and the constant will be zero.
Thus, the model predicts that in contrast with time series regressions, in cross-sectional
regressions with a su¢ ciently long sample period there is no forward premium puzzle. Intuitively, over short time horizons forward and spot exchange rates are in‡uenced by misperceptions about future money growth rates, but over long time horizons the average rates of
exchange rate depreciation are determined by the average money growth di¤erentials between
pairs of countries. In general, such average e¤ects tend to be picked up in cross-sectional
regressions, while the short-term mispricing e¤ects tend to be muted. If the sample period
is su¢ ciently long, the e¤ects of investor overcon…dence will be eliminated in cross-sectional
regressions.

The Carry Trade: An Extension

The model implies that a rational investor could, on average, earn excess returns by holding
the short term debt of countries whose short term interest rates are temporarily higher
relative to the interest rates of other countries. In other words, there are pro…ts to be earned
through carry trade strategies. The Economist (2007) quotes the estimate of one market
analyst that as much as $1 trillion may be invested in the yen carry trade.
Since we have assumed that investors are identically overcon…dent, in equilibrium they
do not engage in the carry trade to exploit the forward premium bias. However, all results of
the model carry through identically if we introduce a set of risk averse rational investors with
measure zero. In such an extended model, the risk-bearing capacity of rational investors is
too small to allow them to a¤ect prices non-negligibly. However, they would engage in carry
trade activity to pro…t from the forward premium bias.19
19

If, instead, we were to introduce a set of rational investors with positive measure, we conjecture that
this would reduce but not eliminate the forward premium bias. In many behavioral models, prices re‡ect
the beliefs of both rational and irrational traders, with weights that depend on the risk bearing capacities

22

It is worth emphasizing that the model predicts that pro…ts are available by trading based
on transitory interest rate di¤erentials, not by holding the treasury bills of a country that
persistently has a higher average nominal interest rate. This is consistent with the empirical
…ndings that countries with steadily higher interest rates and in‡ation (than in the U.S.)
have had steady currency depreciations (against the U.S. dollar), as predicted by UIP (see,
for example, Cochrane, 1999).

A Model with Deviations from PPP

So far we have assumed that PPP holds for the aggregate consumption de‡ators in the two
economies. In this section we extend the model to allow for violations of PPP for aggregate
price de‡ators by introducing nontraded goods. We model nontraded goods producers as
monopolistic competitors and we introduce price stickiness. This lets us study the role of
overcon…dence in a more realistic setting in which prices adjust slowly to in‡ationary shocks.
Although introducing these new features in our model a¤ects the magnitude of the implied
forward premium bias, we …nd that the main implications of the model do not dependent
upon the PPP assumption we made in Section 3. For a wide range of plausible parameter
values, overcon…dence continues to imply substantial bias in the forward premium regression.
In the expanded model there are two goods, traded and nontraded. Traded goods are
modeled, as before, as an endowment. Each country produces its own nontraded good with
labor. We separately consider households, who make decisions about consumption, labor
e¤ort, and money and asset holdings, and monopolistically competitive …rms, who make
decisions about production, labor input and the pricing of goods.

ct = c!T t c1N t! ;

where cT t is the consumption of traded goods, cN t is the consumption of nontraded goods,

constant endowment. There are many di¤erentiated nontraded goods within each country.

The Firm’s Problem

The nontraded good is produced by monopolistic competitors. For simplicity we assume
that the output of variety i of the nontraded good is simply
(36)

xN it = nit ;
where nit is the amount of labor hired by the producer of variety i.

We assume that prices are sticky as in Calvo (1983) and Yun (1996), and follow Galí
(2008) in our description of the representative …rm’s problem. At each date …rms have a
probability 1

, of being able to change their prices, with drawings independent over time.

As in the Calvo-Yun framework, we assume that …rms choose their prices taking the demand
curve for their product as given. Once they set price they satisfy demand by hiring enough
labor to produce a su¢ cient quantity of their product. Suppose that a …rm last set its price
at time t, the price it set was PN t , and it satis…es demand at this price at all future dates
until able to change its price again.20 Then if it has not changed its price by date t + k, its
pro…t at date t + k is

Characterizing the Equilibrium

We continue to assume that there are no trade frictions, so PPP holds for traded goods,
P T t = S t PT t :

(41)

We continue to assume that the money growth rate is given by (13).
Given the laws of motion for domestic and foreign money growth, an equilibrium in our
model is a set of sequences of prices and quantities such that the households in the domestic
economy are maximizing utility subject to their budget constraints (i.e. equations (29)— (35)
are satis…ed), domestic …rms make choices consistent with (36) and (37), foreign households
21

For symmetry we assume that …rms are also overcon…dent. Under the alternative assumption that …rms
have rational expectations, nontraded goods prices would presumably adjust more slowly to in‡ationary
signals.

26

and …rms make choices consistent with the foreign analogs of (29)— (35), (36) and (37),
and markets clear (i.e. equations (38), (39), (40) and the foreign analogs of the latter two
equations are satis…ed).
Given the constant global endowment of traded goods, equilibrium consumption of traded
goods in each country is constant across time and states of the world, cT t = cT and cT t = cT
for all t. We linearize the equilibrium conditions to characterize an approximate solution
to the model. Unfortunately, the model does not have a simple closed form solution as in
the basic model of Section 3. In the appendix, however, we show that the equilibrium of
the model can be characterized by the solution of a …rst-order di¤erence equation in the
deviations of the variables mt , pN t

PN t =PT t ,

Tt

PT t+1 =PT t , and

Nt

PN t+1 =PN t from

their nonstochastic steady state values. For simplicity, we follow Galí (2008), by solving the
model in the neighborhood of a zero in‡ation steady state (in our case, in both countries).
So we set

=

= 0.

In the basic model the forward premium regression coe¢ cient depended on the semielasticity of money demand,

= 1=( i), and the degree of overcon…dence, . In the expanded

model it depends on these parameters as well as the “Calvo parameter,” , the discount
factor,

, the share of traded goods in utility, !, and the parameter that determines the

labor supply elasticity,

. To illustrate the response of the interest di¤erential and the

exchange rate to shocks, we set

= 7 and

= 0:3. To calibrate the rest of the parameters

we think of the natural length of a time interval as one quarter. Consistent with the basic
sticky price models illustrated in Galí (2008) we therefore set

= 2=3 and

= 1. We set

= 0:995, consistent with a two percent real interest rate. Finally, we set ! = 0:35.22
Figure 4 illustrates the responses of the domestic interest rate and the exchange rate
to the date-0 arrival of a unit signal about domestic money growth at date 1. As Figure
4 indicates, the behavior of the interest rate and the exchange rate in response to a signal
shock is very similar to that in the basic model. The exchange rate depreciates on impact
and overshoots. Overcon…dent agents expect the exchange rate to keep depreciating, and
this initially drives the domestic interest rate up.
Three di¤erences between the expanded model and the basic model are worthy of note.
First, domestic prices do not move one-for-one with the exchange rate. Because nontraded
22

This value is approximately consistent with the share of nontraded goods in GDP used by Burnside,
Eichenbaum and Rebelo (2006), and is similar to the CPI weight of tradables, 0:4, used by Burstein, Eichenbaum and Rebelo (2007).

27

goods prices are sticky, they initially rise by much less (0:21 percent) than the exchange rate
depreciates (0:47 percent). As time passes, more …rms adjust prices so that in the long run
nontraded goods prices on average rise by as much as the exchange rate depreciates. Second,
because of the slow adjustment of nontraded goods prices, the overall price level does not
overshoot its long-run level. Third, on average there is a very small and temporary decline
in the interest rate (relative to the initial steady state) after date 0. This decline in the
interest rate re‡ects the fact that agents foresee a very slight appreciation of the domestic
currency after date 1. This expected appreciation is driven by the real e¤ects of the shock.
Sticky prices cause an increase in the demand for nontraded goods, and after the impact
period this has the net e¤ect that the demand for real money balances rises, causing a slight
appreciation of the exchange rate.
In our calibrated example, the forward premium regression coe¢ cient is
somewhat higher than the value of

1:4 implied by the basic model when

Figure 5 illustrates the sensitivity of

to the Calvo price stickiness parameter, , and the

overcon…dence parameter . The basic model of Section 3 is equivalent to the expanded
model when

= 0.

As before, we …nd that the amount of bias in
overcon…dence. The amount of bias in

on the other hand, is not very sensitive to the value

0:5. Most calibrations of the Calvo parameter assume

lies in this range and 0:1 <

2=3. Assuming

< 0:4, we see that the expanded model’s quantitative

predictions for the forward premium regression are similar to those of the basic model.
Overall, we conclude that the conclusions we drew from the basic model are not dependent
on the assumption that PPP holds at the level of aggregate consumption.

Monetary Policy and Interest Rate Rules

It is arguable that in reality the quantity of money is endogenous, and that monetary policy
determines the nominal interest rate. We therefore modify the extended model of the previous section by characterizing monetary policy in each country as an interest rate rule.23
Since the money growth rate is endogenous in this setting, we abandon the exogenous law
of motion for money growth given by (13). Having done so, we need to modify the model to
See, for example, Benigno and Benigno (2003), Clarida, Ga´li and Gertler (2001), Gali and Monacelli
(2005), and McCallum and Nelson (2000).
23

28

incorporate an exogenous source of in‡ationary shocks that agents receive signals about.
There are many possibilities, but to keep our model as simple as possible we assume that
the production technology in the nontraded goods sector, previously given by (36), is instead
given by
(42)

xN it = e t nit :
Here,

is a shock to the production technology. In standard sticky price models, negative

t

shocks to technology lead to increases in in‡ation (see Galí, 2008). We assume that the law
of motion for

t

is given by
t

where

t

) and ut

N (0;

(43)

are i.i.d. processes. As we assumed before, at date

t individuals observe a noisy signal about ut ,

t

= ut + t , where

t

N (0;

2

) is an i.i.d.

process.
To close the model we assume that monetary policy in the domestic economy is given by
^{t =

{t 1
i^

+ (1

i)

EtC ^ t+1 + (1

^N t ;
i) y c

(44)

where, as before, ^{t , ^ t , and c^N t represent deviations of the interest rate, the in‡ation rate,
and the consumption of nontraded goods from their steady state values. Our interest rate
rule has two important features. First, policy makers smooth the path of the interest rate
if

i

> 0. Second, policy makers are forward looking and set the current interest rate by

responding to agents’expectations of future in‡ation and output.24 Our assumption that the
interest rate rule is forward-looking with respect to in‡ation is consistent with the evidence
provided by Clarida, Galí and Gertler (1998).
Apart from these changes the model remains the same as the model in the previous
section. We work through the details of the model’s solution in the appendix. Importantly, as
with the models studied earlier, without overcon…dence ( = 0) there is no forward premium
bias;

1

= 1 regardless of other parameters. In other words, in the model, overcon…dence is

required to explain the forward premium bias.
To illustrate that the model continues to imply forward premium bias for reasonable
parameterizations, we maintain the calibration of Section 5. We must also specify the parameters of the interest rate rule,

i,

and

y.

24

Here we present impulse response functions

Here, because the endowment of traded goods is assumed to be constant, deviations of output from the
steady state are proportional to deviations of nontraded consumption from the steady state.

29

for two calibrations. In the …rst calibration we set

i

= 0:95,

= 2, and

y

= 0:5, values

similar to those estimated by Clarida, Galí and Gertler (1998) for the Federal Reserve in the
post-1982 period. In the second calibration we set

i

= 0:95,

= 7:5, and

y

= 0. Here,

the monetary authority responds much more aggressively to in‡ation and has no concern
with the output gap.
We now illustrate what happens to the economy when agents receive a negative signal
about the level of technology at date 0. Impulse response functions for the …rst calibration
are illustrated in Figure 6. In terms of dynamics, this case is quite similar to the one studied
in the previous section (the expanded model with a money growth rule), but with two
exceptions: the interest rate rises persistently in response to the shock, re‡ecting interest
rate smoothing, and the price level slightly overshoots its long-run level. The model-implied
value of the slope coe¢ cient in the forward premium regression for this case is

1

=

3:1.

Impulse response functions for the second calibration are illustrated in Figure 7. When
the central bank responds more aggressively to in‡ationary expectations, as it does in this
case, the exchange rate actually appreciates upon the arrival of the signal. On average
the exchange rate continues to appreciate for one more period, overshooting its long-run
level. Additionally, consumer prices rise immediately in response to the signal. This implies
that in some parameterizations our model is consistent with evidence that in some cases
unanticipated but temporary increases in in‡ation are associated with short-term exchange
rate appreciation (see, for example, Andersen et. al., 2003 and Clarida and Waldman, 2008).
Intuitively, investors foresee that the central bank will respond to news of high in‡ation
with aggressive tightening. The model-implied value of the slope coe¢ cient in the forward
premium regression in this case is

1

=

0:6.

Given the results of the two calibrations, it is clear that the value of the slope coe¢ cient
in the forward premium regression is highly sensitive to the parameterization of the interest
rate rule. To investigate this further we computed
and
(

y.

for a wide range of values of

Our results are shown in Figure 8. When the interest rate rule is less aggressive

is smaller), there is more forward premium bias (

1

is more negative). This empirical

implication of the theory merits further empirical testing. The degree of forward premium
bias is relatively insensitive to

y

in the range we consider.

We conclude that as long as investors are su¢ ciently overcon…dent, quantitatively plausible forward premium bias emerges from our model even when monetary policy takes the

30

form of an interest rate rule. The model can, at the same time, capture the stylized fact
that unanticipated increases in in‡ation are associated with exchange rate appreciation in
the short run. In the model this occurs if monetary policy responds aggressively enough to
changes in expected in‡ation.

Concluding Remarks

Motivated by evidence from the psychology of individual judgment, we o¤er an explanation
for the forward premium puzzle in foreign exchange markets based upon investor overcon…dence. In the model, investors overreact to information about future in‡ation, which causes
greater overshooting in the forward rate than in the spot rate. Thus, the forward premium
re‡ects the overreaction in the spot rate and predicts its subsequent correction. The forward
premium bias results when this overreaction-correction e¤ect dominates the conventional
e¤ect implied by UIP. The model can explain the magnitude of the forward premium bias,
its greater strength at short time horizons than at long time horizons and in the time series
than in the cross section, and other stylized facts about forward and spot exchange rates
and professional forecasts. Our approach is also consistent with the availability of pro…table
carry trade strategies.
Our approach suggests some further directions for theoretical and empirical exploration.
First, an important stylized fact about foreign exchange markets is that carry trade returns
are negatively skewed (see, for example, Brunnermeier, Nagel and Pedersen, 2009). Recent
theoretical work on foreign exchange markets (Brunnermeier and Pedersen, 2009; and Plantin
and Shin, 2010) shows that liquidity constraints can explain such skewness and ‘currency
crashes’owing to the occasional occurrence of a ‘rush for the exit’by carry traders. However,
these papers take as given the existence of expected pro…t opportunities (i.e., the forward
bias) that cause rational investors to become carry traders in the …rst place.
Our approach is complementary to these studies in o¤ering an explanation for forward
bias based upon investor psychology, and therefore an explanation for the existence of the
pro…t opportunities for rational carry traders. We conjecture that a setting that includes both
rational liquidity-constrained speculators (as in these previous papers) and overcon…dent
investors (as in ours) can capture skewness as well as the other stylized facts explained by
our model.
There is also evidence that currency crashes are associated with periods of higher volatility
31

in foreign exchange markets (see, for example, Clarida, Davis and Pedersen, 2009; and
Menkho¤, Sarno, Schmeling, and Schrimpf, 2010). A possible explanation for periods of high
volatility is that investor con…dence shifts over time. During periods of high overcon…dence,
exchange rates should overreact more, thereby increasing the volatility of exchange rates
and carry trade pro…ts. If, in addition, there are liquidity constraints, this high volatility
can be associated with currency crashes, consistent with the evidence. We view this as an
interesting direction for future research.
Our model implies that the forward premium bias will be more pronounced in periods in
which investors are more overcon…dent. Previous behavioral …nance research suggests that
overcon…dence-induced overreaction is associated with greater trading volume, high return
volatility, large cross-…rm valuation dispersion, and strong return momentum and reversals
(at di¤erent time horizons). This suggests testing whether the forward premium bias is more
pronounced in periods where such variables are high.
Finally, it is interesting to consider whether overcon…dence explains the ability of the term
structure of domestic interest rates to predict bond returns. The bond pricing literature has
identi…ed that yield di¤erentials between long and short-term bonds predict bond returns
(e.g., Fama and Bliss 1987, Campbell and Shiller 1991, Cochrane and Piazzesi 2005). Our
…nding that overcon…dence can explain the forward premium puzzle, which also involves
return predictability based upon bond yield di¤erentials, suggests that overcon…dence may
o¤er an integrated explanation of return predictability anomalies in domestic bond markets
as well.

Notes: The table reports the root mean squared error (RMSE), in log-percent, of …ve forecasting rules for the logarithm of the exchange rate. For the simple forecasting rules, the
forecast set+1 is set equal to either the log of the one-month forward rate, ft , or the log of
the current spot rate, st . For the regression-based methods we use in-sample forecasts, in
the sense that the regression coe¢ cients used to generate the forecast are estimates based
on the full sample of data. In each case the regression is st+1 st = + xt + t+1 , and
the forecast is formed as set+1 = st + ^ + ^ xt , where ^ and ^ are the estimated coe¢ cients
and xt is the indicated right-hand-side variable. Data source: Datastream BBI end-of-month
exchange rates. The sample period for each currency is provided in Table 1.

Notes: This graph illustrates the average path of movement for the spot and forward exchange rates from date 1 to date 1 conditional on a date-0 signal about the date-1 money
growth (or in‡ation) di¤erential. The …gure depicts the case of a positive signal, that is a
rise in domestic money growth relative to foreign money growth at date 1. Paths for the
forward rate are indicated in red, for the spot rate in blue. Paths under rational expectations
are indicated by dashed lines, under overcon…dence by solid lines. In response to the signal,
under rational expectations, at date 0 the spot and forward exchange rates rise from s = f
R
R
R
to sR
0 and f0 , respectively, with f0 > s0 . At date 1, the average realizations of the two rates
are both E0R (s1 ). When agents are overcon…dent, at date 0 the spot and forward exchange
R
rates rise from s = f to s0 > sR
0 and f0 > f0 , with f0 > s0 . The graph illustrates the
case where the overcon…dence e¤ect is strong enough that s0 overshoots its long-run average
level, E0R (s1 ). Thus, a rise in the forward premium predicts a downward correction in the
spot exchange rate.

Notes: The graphs illustrate the paths of the interest rate and exchange rate in response
to the arrival, at time 0, of a positive unit signal of an increase in the money growth rate
di¤erential. Panel (a) illustrates the case where investors have rational expectations. The
paths are illustrated as deviations from the nonstochastic steady state. Panel (b) illustrates
the case where investors are overcon…dent. In the exchange rate graphs we illustrate up to
four paths for the exchange rate. The path labeled “true signal”is the path of the exchange
rate if the unit signal, = 1, corresponds to a realized shock to the money growth rate,
u = 1. The path labeled “false signal” is the path of the exchange rate if the unit signal,
= 1, corresponds to a realized noise shock, = 1. The path labeled “average signal”is the
average path taken by the exchange rate given the distributions of u and . The path labeled
“agents’expectations,”which is only relevant in the case where investors are overcon…dent,
is the path overcon…dent agents expect upon receiving the signal at time 0.

Linearization of the Model

We begin by …nding the nonstochastic steady state value of m. Setting mt = mt+1 = m and
t+1

in (10) we have
m = %c= 1

1=

e

(A1)

:

Taking a …rst order Taylor series approximation to (10) in the neighborhood of the nonstochastic steady state we have
%m c m

EtC ^ t+1 + e

m)=m and ^ t

. Collecting terms and dividing by e

(A2)
we obtain
(A3)

can rewrite (A3) as

EtC m

m
^ t = EtC ^ t+1 :

(A4)

We can rewrite (11) in terms of the interest rate:

%mt c:

(A5)

Taking a …rst order Taylor series approximation to (A5) in the neighborhood of the nonstochastic steady state we have
(1 + i)
where ^{t

^{t = %m c m
^t

dit =(1 + i). Multiplying through by

(1 + i) and using the fact that %m c =

i=(1 + i) we obtain
^{t =

im
^t =

m
^ t= :

(A6)

By (12) we have st = ln St = ln(mt =mt ) + ln(Mt =Mt ). Thus, to …rst order,
st = ln(m =m) + m
^t

m
^ t + ln(Mt =Mt ):

Using the solutions for m
^ t and m
^ t given by (16) and (17) gives equation (20). By covered
interest rate parity we have Ft =St = (1 + it )=(1 + it ). The log of the forward premium is
ft

st = ln(1 + it )

ln(1 + it ):

To get quantitative predictions from the model we proceed as follows. We assume that
the two countries have identical, independent money growth processes. We let

set var(u) =

C

var( ). Then we note that
var ( st+1 ) = 2

var( ) + var( ) + (1

var( ) + (2

We set var ( st+1 ) equal to the mean of the sample variances of

st+1 for our sample of 11

countries in the above formula to obtain var( ). This allows us to calculate

Mean Squared Error of Forecasting Rules

Solving the Expanded Model

Tt

Pt =PT t , wXt

Wt =PT t , pN t

PT t =PT t 1 . Using the fact that cT t = cT for all t, and these newly de…ned

To proceed further we now derive an expression for ~ N t using (27). Any …rm that is setting its price has price PN t because all …rms setting price at time t have the same …rst

Since wXt = (Wt =PT t ) it follows that wXt = (Wt =Pt ) (Pt =PT t ) = wt pXt and w^Xt = w^t + p^Xt .
Hence, using (A7) and (A12) we have w^Xt = w

solve the model using the method of King, Plosser and Rebelo (2002). The solution takes

Solving the Model with an Interest Rate Rule

The equilibrium conditions of the model, as in the previous case, reduce to four equations.
Equations (A14) and (A18) are unchanged. Equation (A16) is dropped because the money
growth rate is endogenous. It is replaced by (44). Finally, equation (A23) is modi…ed to
take into account the fact that the …rm’s marginal cost now depends on the stochastic level
of technology:

Equations (A14), (A18), (A27) and (A28), represent a …rst order linear di¤erence equation
in the variables ^ N t , p^N t , ^ T t and m
^ t , with

t

being exogenous. As in the previous section,

it is then straightforward to solve the model using the method of King, Plosser and Rebelo
(2002). Once again, the solution takes the form (A24) with the matrices

i

i = 1, 2, 3, being

di¤erent nonlinear functions of the deep parameters than in the previous model. Further
details of the solution procedure are available from the authors.
