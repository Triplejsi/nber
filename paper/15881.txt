ABSTRACT
This paper examines the determinants of intra-firm trade in U.S. imports using detailed country-product
data. We create a new measure of product contractibility based on the degree of intermediation in international
trade for the product. We find important roles for the interaction of country and product characteristics
in determining intra-firm trade shares. Intra-firm trade is high for products with low levels of contractability
sourced from countries with weak governance, for skill-intensive products from skill-scarce countries,
and for capital-intensive products from capital-abundant countries.

Introduction
Research on multinational …rms has recently been extended to incorporate elements

of contract theory. This literature addresses …rms’ decisions to source components inhouse versus at arm’s length and their choices over whether to locate production at home
or abroad. It di¤ers from earlier work on multinationals in its emphasis on the costs
associated with writing contracts for specialized inputs and on the importance of traded
intermediate goods.
This paper provides an empirical examination of the determinants of intra-…rm trade.
We use detailed U.S. import data to characterize the product and country attributes that
determine …rms’ decisions to import from related parties rather than at arm’s length.
Theoretical models addressing this issue focus on the ability of the …rm to write contracts
for the production of specialized inputs. We introduce a new measure of products’revealed
contractibility based on the idea that contracting is easier for products that are traded
by intermediaries such as wholesalers.
Forty-six percent of U.S. imports occur between related parties in 2000. This aggregate
statistic, however, obscures considerable variation in intra-…rm intensity across import
partners as well as products. Indeed, while 74 percent of U.S. imports from Japan are
intra-…rm, the …gure for Bangladesh is just 2 percent. Likewise, trade between related
parties accounts for 2 percent of U.S. imports of rubber and plastic footwear, but more
than 70 percent of U.S. imports of autos, medical equipment and instruments. There is
also signi…cant variation in intra-…rm intensity across countries within products.
These …gures highlight the importance of product and country characteristics – and
especially their interaction –in explaining intra-…rm trade. Such factors are emphasized
in recent theoretical models of multinational …rms that stress the role of contracting
in …rms’ decisions both to source components in-house versus at arm’s length and to
locate production at home versus abroad.1 These models di¤er from earlier theories
of multinationals in their emphasis on the costs associated with writing contracts for
specialized inputs and the attention they pay to traded intermediate goods. Guided by
these models, we examine the product and country determinants of intra-…rm trade.
Our …ndings are related to the large theoretical literature on international trade and
the boundaries of the …rm, including in particular Antràs (2003), Antràs and Helpman
(2004), and Grossman and Helpman (2002, 2005). Our …ndings are also related to the
recent empirical literature examining the predictions of these models, including Corcos

et al. (2008), Defever and Toubal (2007), Nunn and Tre‡er (2008) and Yeaple (2006).
More generally, our …ndings are related to the recent literature on institutions and trade,
including Levchenko (2007) and Nunn (2007).
We …nd that our measure of contractibility and countries’governance quality are associated with variation in intra-…rm trade in interesting and intuitive ways, and that factors
associated with engaging in related-party trade di¤er from those associated with the intensity of intra-…rm trade once a link is established. Higher-quality country governance,
for example, is associated with a higher probability of related-party trade taking place.
Further increases in quality, however, coincide with lower shares of related-party trade,
presumably due to the greater ease with which arm’s-length contracts can be written.
With respect to interactions of product and country attributes, improvements in country governance lead to the largest reductions in intra-…rm trade in low contractibility
products.
2.

Data

We use the U.S. Linked/Longitudinal Firm Trade Transaction Database (LFTTD),
which links individual U.S. trade transactions to U.S. …rms.2 For each import transaction,
we observe the U.S. …rm engaging in the transaction, the ten-digit Harmonized System
(HS) classi…cation of the product shipped, the (nominal) value shipped, the shipment
date, the source country, and whether the transaction takes place at “arm’s length”(AL)
or between “related parties” (RP). Import partners are “related” if either party owns,
directly or indirectly, 6 percent or more of the other party.3 To concord SIC production
and HS trade data, and to expand the sample of countries on which data on country
characteristics are available, we focus on the year 1997.
To explore the role of various country characteristics discussed below, we combine
these trade data with measures of physical capital abundance, human capital abundance,
and population from Robert E. Hall and Charles I. Jones (1999), a composite index
of countries’ governance quality from the World Bank, and measures of trade and FDI
protection from Heritage Foundation/WSJ (2006). We use factor analysis to create
a univariate measure of country governance for 1996 from the six World Bank measures
reported by Daniel Kaufman, Aart Kraay and Massimo Mastruzzi (2006). The …rst factor
accounts for around 90 percent of the variance of each of the six component measures and

education, public administration and several smaller sectors.

we use this factor as the indicator of governance in our empirical work.
We measure products’capital and skill intensity using data from the 1997 U.S. Census of Manufactures. We assign all ten-digit HS products within a particular four-digit
SIC industry the average physical capital or skill intensity of all plants whose output is
concentrated in that industry. Physical capital intensity is measured as the log of the
book value of plant and equipment per employee while skill is non-production workers
as a share of employment. Industry headquarters intensity is measured by the average
share of …rm employment at headquarters and auxiliary establishments.
3.

Intra-…rm imports
This section documents the extent of U.S. intra-…rm imports by trading partner and

industry. To maximize our ability to report results across countries and industries, we
use recently published, publicly available data on related-party trade from the Foreign
Trade Division of the U.S. Census Bureau.4

The industry data on related-party trade

is reported according to the North American Industry Classi…cation System (NAICS)
and, as a result, di¤ers from the more detailed Harmonized System codes available in the
LFFTD and employed in the subsequent regression analysis.
3.1. By Country
We begin by considering variation in related-party imports across countries in 2000.
The data are summarized in Table 1 which reports the level of imports and the share of
related-party imports by country. Over 46 percent of U.S. imports are intra-…rm and there
is wide range in intensity of intra-…rm trade across countries. For the average country,
23.8 percent of exports to the U.S. are intra-…rm and more than a quarter of countries
have intra-…rm shares less than 5 percent. On the low end, imports from Bangladesh are
almost entirely arms-length transactions, with just 2 percent of the total value of imports
taking place inside the …rm. In contrast, imports from Japan and Ireland are dominated
by intra-…rm transactions. In 2000, 76 percent of the value of imports from Ireland
and 74 percent of the imports from Japan were conducted by multinationals trading
with related foreign divisions. Anecdotal publicly-available evidence would suggest that
the intra-…rm imports of Ireland and Japan stem from di¤erent types of organizations.
Japanese intra-…rm shipments to the U.S. are likely trades between Japanese parents and
4
We choose 2000 as it is the year closest to the product-country import data used in our
empirical speci…cations below.

U.S. subsidiaries, while Irish intra-…rm shipments are more likely to be between Irish
subsidiaries and U.S. parents, or U.S. a¢ liates of European multinationals.
In general, countries that account for low shares of U.S. intra-…rm imports are less
developed and have lower overall import volumes, while high-income countries in the
OECD generally report above average intra-…rm imports to the United States. Imports
from China, the fourth largest source of U.S. imports in 2000, are still largely conducted
between unrelated parties with just 18 percent exchanged inside the …rm.
3.2. By Industry
As with the country-level data, industries vary widely in the extent to which their
trade takes place within …rms.5 Imports of leather, textiles and apparel are dominated by
arms-length transactions while more than half of imports in transportation equipment,
computers and electronics products and chemicals are conducted between related parties.
Table 2 reports the manufacturing industries with the 20 highest and 20 lowest shares
of related-party trade in 2000 using 6-digit NAICS industries. Footwear industries are
heavily represented in the low end of the distribution of intra-…rm trade shares. In rubber
and plastic footwear, for example, intra-…rm imports account for just 1.8 percent of total
imports. Imports of autos and related equipment, medical equipment and pharmaceuticals, and instruments, on the other hand, are dominated by intra-…rm transactions. In
each of these industries, more than 70 percent of all imports are between related parties.
These industry averages obscure important variation across countries within products.
Figure 1 shows the distribution of imports of Photo Films, Plates and Chemicals (NAICS
325992) across countries. This industry has …fth highest share of intra-…rm imports.
The …gure shows both the share of intra-…rm imports from each country (line - left axis)
and the level of overall imports (bar - log scale right axis). The countries are sorted by
the share of intra-…rm imports in total imports in 2000. While the industry as a whole
has a high level of intra-…rm trade, there is substantial variation across countries. Half
the countries, including most of the major exporters by volume, have intra-…rm shares
greater than 70 percent. Most of the remaining countries, including a number of middle
income and developing countries, have little or no related-party trade to the U.S..
This pattern of heterogeneous intra-…rm shares across countries within industries is
the norm rather than the exception. Figure 2 shows the same picture for imports of Other
5

In this section we use publicly available data from the foreign trade division of the Census Bureau.
As a consequence these table use the NAICS industry classi…cation system. In our regression results
below we use the much more disaggregated 10-digit products of the Harmonized System.

Footwear (NAICS 316219).6 This industry has sixth lowest share of intra-…rm imports
but again there is a wide variation in related party shares ranging from 100 percent
to zero.

This variation in intra-…rm imports shares within industries across countries

motivates our use of both country and product characteristics and their interaction in our
subsequent empirical work.
4.

"Revealed Contractibility"

We assume that products passing through intermediaries are the easiest over which
to contract. As a result, we measure products’“revealed”contractibility as the weighted
average wholesale employment share of …rms importing the product, using …rms’import
value as weights,
IM EDp =

X
f

Wf Mpf
:
EM Pf Mp

(1)

The …rst term in the intermediation measure is the share of wholesale employment (Wf )
in …rm f ’s total employment (EM Pf ).7 The second term is the import share of …rm
f in ten-digit HS product market p, with Mpf and Mp representing …rm f ’s imports
of product p and total U.S. imports of product p, respectively. Intermediation ranges
between zero and unity: if no …rms importing product p have any wholesale establishments,
IM EDp = 0. On the other hand, if product p is imported exclusively by …rms with 100
percent employment in wholesaling, IM EDp = 1.
Table 3 reports the intermediation measure for HS2 industries in 1997. Industries are
sorted according to intermediation, from low to high. Across industries, intermediation
averages 0.241, ranging from 0.012 in non-railway vehicles (HS 87) to 0.631 in lead (HS
78), with an interquartile range of 0.123 to 0.345. Agricultural goods and relatively labor
intensive industries such as apparel and footwear generally have the highest measured
intermediation, while more “sophisticated” products such as vehicles, pharmaceuticals,
chemicals and photographic goods have the lowest measures of intermediation.
Intermediation and intra-…rm import shares are inversely related across two-digit HS
categories, as shown in Figure 1. There is however substantial independent variation in
the two variables, as industries with similar levels of intermediation span a wide range of
intra-…rm intensity. Footwear (HS 64) and Organic Chemicals (HS 29), for example, have
6

Only countries with more than $100,000 of of U.S. imports are shown.
We observe employment at the establishment level and therefore assign all employees in an establishment to the major industry of the establishment. Firms with a single establishment necessarily have 100
percent employment in a single industry. Wholesale is NAICS sector 42.

comparable levels of intermediation, 0.135 and 0.136 respectively. However, more than
half of Organic Chemicals imports are conducted by related parties while the intra-…rm
trade share for Footwear is less than 10 percent.
5.

Determinants of intra-…rm trade
Our empirical analysis uses cross-sectional data on intra-…rm and total U.S. imports

of product p from county c in 1997. Our empirical speci…cation regresses measures of
intra-…rm trade (IFpc ) on product characteristics (Xp ), country characteristics (Zc ) and
interactions between product and country characteristics (Xp Zc ):
IFpc = + Xp + Zc + (Xp Zc ) +

pc ;

(2)

We consider two measures of intra-…rm trade: the share of intra-…rm imports in U.S.
imports, which we refer to as the “intensive”margin, and a dummy variable which is equal
to one if there are positive intra-…rm imports for a product from a country, which we call
the “extensive” margin. In constructing the interaction terms, we subtract the sample
mean from each variable entering the interaction term. This normalization ensures that
the main e¤ects of each variable can be interpreted as the e¤ect at the sample mean.
Our choice of product and country characteristics is motivated by the recent theoretical literature on contractual frictions and international trade. This literature emphasizes
the relative importance of relationship-speci…c investments by headquarters and supplier
…rms and the degree of veri…ability of these investments. In Antràs (2003), capital intensity captures the relative importance of headquarters’investments, and hence we include
industry capital intensity and country capital abundance. To allow for the possibility that
other factor intensities matter, we also include industry skill intensity and country skill
abundance. In Antràs and Helpman (2004), headquarters investments are interpreted
more broadly, and hence we include the direct measure of headquarters intensity noted
above. In Grossman and Helpman (2005), the degree of veri…ability of relationship-speci…c
investments can vary with product and country characteristics, and hence we include revealed product contractibility and country governance as further independent variables.
Finally, we explore the impact of policy-based barriers by including measures of trade and
FDI protection as country characteristics.
Table 4 reports the results of estimating speci…cation (2). Columns (1) and (3) use the
extensive margin as the dependent variable, so the sample comprises all product-country
cells with positive imports, including those with zero intra-…rm trade. Columns (2) and

Intra-Firm Trade and Product Contractibility

8

(4) focus on the intensive margin, and the sample is all observations with positive intra…rm trade. Columns (3) and (4) control for the non-random selection of observations
with positive intra-…rm imports using the Heckman two-stage estimation procedure. The
two stages are separately identi…ed by functional form and the excluded variable from
the second-stage regression. For the excluded variable, we choose the cost of phone calls
to the US, which arguably a¤ects the …xed costs of establishing an a¢ liate but not the
relative variable costs of intra-…rm versus arms-length trade.8
We …nd an important role for revealed contractibility on both the intensive and extensive margins of intra-…rm trade. Consistent with the recent theoretical literature
on contractual frictions in international trade, columns (1) and (2) show that higher revealed product contractibility is associated with less intra-…rm trade. The role of the
contracting environment varies across the intensive and extensive margins.

Increases

in governance quality raise the probability that foreign a¢ liates are present (column 1),
but are associated with lower shares of intra-…rm trade (column 2). This result suggests
good governance promotes the establishment of related-party trade but not its intensity
once established, which is consistent with the idea that arm’s-length contracting is easier
in countries with good governance. This non-linearity in the role of the country contracting environment is not formally developed in existing theoretical models. Similar
di¤erences between the intensive and extensive margins are present for population and
FDI protection.
Results in Table 4 also indicate the signi…cance of interactions of product and country
characteristics in determining intra-…rm trade. While the main e¤ects for intermediation
and country governance are both negative in column (4), the interaction term has a
positive coe¢ cient. That is, improved governance is associated with less intra-…rm trade,
especially for goods with lower revealed contractibility.
In contrast to previous work, we also …nd a role for industry skill intensity and country skill abundance. The main e¤ects of industry skill intensity on intra-…rm trade are
positive for both the intensive and extensive margins; the main e¤ects of country human
capital abundance are negative; and the estimated coe¢ cients on the skill interaction
terms are negative. Therefore, greater industry skill intensity increases the share of intra…rm trade, and leads to larger increases in more skill-scarce countries. In contrast, greater
country skill abundance reduces the share of intra-…rm trade, and leads to larger reductions in more skill-intensive products.
8

As in Antràs (2003), industry capital intensity

and country capital abundance play a role in determining the share of intra-…rm trade.
The positive coe¢ cient on the interaction between industry capital intensity and country
capital abundance implies that intra-…rm trade shares are high for capital-intensive products coming from capital-abundant countries. Both FDI and trade protection in‡uence
intra-…rm trade; headquarters intensity is not statistically signi…cantly associated with
intra-…rm trade shares.
In Table 5, we repeat the OLS speci…cation from column (2) in Table 4 with a complete
set of country and product …xed e¤ects to examine the robustness of the results on the
interaction terms. The contractibility-governance and human capital interactions retain
their sign and signi…cance while the interaction on physical capital is insigni…cant.
5.1. Robustness
In this section we explore the robustness of the results to alternative speci…cations.
Column 1 of Table 6 repeats the preferred speci…cation from column 4 in Table 4.

In

columns 2-4, we drop sectors that contain …rms that do not conform strictly to the existing theoretical models. The literature on multinationals and contracting envisions a
producing …rm headquartered in an advanced country importing intermediate goods, potentially from its a¢ liates. Our results in column 1 include all imports, including imports
of …nal goods and imports by U.S. a¢ liates of foreign multinationals. Column 2 excludes
sectors that are intensive in foreign-owned …rms, column 3 drops …nal goods products and
column 4 drops both at once.9 None of the coe¢ cients change sign or signi…cance and
all the main conclusions are robust to these sample changes.
In the …nal three columns of Table 6, we include additional regressors considered in
related empirical work. Column 5 adds a measure of industry R&D intensity, the R&D
to sales ratio which is only available for a subset of industries.10 The R&D coe¢ cient
is positive and signi…cant, con…rming results in Antràs (2003), Yeaple (2006) and others.
Adding industry R&D intensity eliminates the signi…cance of the physical capital interaction as well as that of human capital intensity. Finally in columns 6 and 7, we add
the measure of contractibility suggested by Nunn (2007) based on the proportion of each
9

To identify sectors that are intensive in foreign a¢ liate imports, we use the Bureau of Economic
Analysis measure of US imports shipped to a¢ liates by the foreign parent group by sector. We construct a measure foreign input intensity by dividing the imports shipped to a¢ liates by employment
in an industry. High foreign a¢ liate industries are those above the mean.
Data is available at
http://www.bea.gov/scb/account_articles/international/iidguide.htm#FDIUS. We follow the classi…cation of Sitchinava (2007) to identify product categories that are …nal good imports. All columns of Table
6 report the second stage of a Heckman speci…cation with the cost of phone calls as the excluded variable
in the second stage.

industry’s intermediate inputs that are relationship-speci…c and therefore susceptible to
potential contracting problems.11 Column 7 includes an interaction of the Nunn measure
with the country governance measure. The Nunn measure is positive and signi…cant, as
found by Nunn and Tre‡er (2008), but does not a¤ect the revealed contractibility measure or its interaction. The interaction term is negative and signi…cant, which combined
with the negative main e¤ect of country governance implies that improvements in country
governance are associated with the largest reductions in intra-…rm trade in sectors with
more relationship-speci…c inputs. These results suggest that the Nunn measure of input
sophistication and our measure of intermediation may be capturing di¤erent aspects of
product contractibility both of which interact with country governance in shaping whether
trade occurs within the boundary of the …rm.
6.

Conclusions
The literature on …rms and international trade has focused attention on issues of con-

tracting and the boundaries of the …rm. This research speaks to policy issues surrounding
the growth of outsourcing, o¤shoring and international production networks.
Our results provide evidence on the role of country governance and product contractibility in determining intra-…rm trade. We …nd evidence of selection: the decision
to establish a foreign a¢ liate in a country di¤ers from the choice of how much to source
from the a¢ liate once it is established. While a¢ liates are more likely to be situated in
countries that are larger and have better governance, once a¢ liates exist, the share of
intra-…rm trade is negatively related to both country size and country governance quality.
Our …ndings both complement and extend the existing empirical literature on intra…rm trade. Our results con…rm the role of industry capital intensity and country capital
abundance in in‡uencing intra-…rm trade. Our results also point to the role of other
interactions between country and product characteristics and their interactions.

11

According to Nunn (2007), relationship speci…c inputs are those that are not traded on organized
exchanges as measured by Rauch (1999).

Note: In constructing the interaction terms, we subtract the sample mean from
each variable entering the interaction term, so that the main effects of each
variable can be interpreted as the effect at the sample mean. Columns 1 and 3

adjusted for clustering at the four-digit SIC level are reported below coefficient
estimates. ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels

Note: Column (1) replicates the baseline results from column (4) in Table 5. In constructing the interaction terms, we subtract the
sample mean from each variable entering the interaction term, so that the main effects of each variable can be interpreted as the effect
at the sample mean. Robust standard errors adjusted for clustering at the four-digit SIC level are reported below coefficient estimates.
***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels respectively.
