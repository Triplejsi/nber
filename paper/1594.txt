Introduction

The idea that there is a systematic relationship between yield and
term to maturity on debt instruments is a persuasive one aria accounts for

one of the largest literatures in monetary economics, that of the term to

On a purely descriptive level? the

maturity structure of interest rates.

scatter of points recording observed yield and term to maturity for
securities within a particular class at a given time strongly suggests the

existence of an underlying smooth function relating yield to maturity.
Such a function is called a yield curve.
The fitting of yield curves to yield/maturity data goes back at least

to the pioneering efforts of David Durand (1942) whose method of fitting
was to position a French curve on the scatter of points in such a way

the resulting curve appeared subjectively reasonable.

that

Yield •may be

transformed to present value and 3. Huston PicCulloch (1971, 1975) has
proposed approximating the present value function by a piecewise polynomial

spline fitted to price data. 6ary Shea (1982, 1984) has shown that the

resulting yield function tends to bend sharply towards the end of the
maturity range observed In the sample.

This would seem to be a most

unlikely property of a true yield curve relationship and also suggests that
these models would not be useful for prediction outside the sample• maturity
range.

Other researchers have fitted a variety of parametric models to

yield curves, including Cohen, Kramer, and Waugh (1966); Fisher (1966);

Echols and Elliott (1976); Dobson (1978); and Chambers, Carleton and
Waldman (1984).

Some of these are based on polynomial regression; and all

Extrapolation of

yields outside the maturity range of bills allows us to predict the price

and directions for further research.

2.

Motivation for the Model

A U.S. Treasury bill is a promise to pay the amount of its face value

on a stated maturity date. Since there are no interim coupon payments on a

bill
on

the market price Is necessarily less than its face value.

The yield

the bill is defined to be that rate of return which produces the face

value from an investment equal to the market price in the time remaining

until maturity.

Arbitrage assures that all bills with a given maturity

date sell at the same price, and therefore have the same yield, at any

instant in time.

Bills of different maturities may of course sell at

prices which imply different yields to maturity at the same point in time.

The yields on any two bills of different maturities imply a forward yield
or rate for the time Interval between the maturities of the two bills.

If

the laturities are, say, m1 days and m2 days (m2 > m1) then an investor can

secure the forward rate of return for an (m2—m1) day period to begin m1
days hence by selling bills of m1 days to maturity and replacing them with
S

bills of m2 days to maturity.

The incentive to do this will vary directly

with the difference between the forward rate available in the market and

the investor1s assessment of the rates of return which are ljkely to be
available In the market on bills of (m2—m1) days to maturity m1 days from

considerations cf this sort lead

us

to

posit

that a satisfactory model

for the iel curve must imply forward rates that are smooth as a function
of horizon and that oscillations in the function, if any must damp down.
These will also be properties of the yield curve because yield to maturity

can be expressed as a sTioothinQ of the intervenino forward rates.

This second

equation points out that any wrinkles in the yield curve, giving rise to
large

values of the slope, have a maqnified effect on forward rates as we

consider laroer maturities.

IF

our hypothesis that the forward rate

function becomes smoother with increasing a is correct, then the relation
between R(m) and m must be even smoother.

Do actual yields on bills, plotted against maturity, display the
smoothness we expect to find?

To form a preliminary impression, consider

the plot of U.S. Treasury bill yields displayed in Figure 1.

These are

continuously compounded yields at an annual rate computed from closing
asked discount yields •on the New York Federal Reserve quote sheet for

January 22, 1981.

The yields rise as a function of maturity untjl about

100 days maturity and then decline generally until about 300 days maturity
where they appear to level off.

To be an acceptable candidate to fit this

data a function needs to have the capability of rising to a maximum and
then falling monotonically towards an asymptotic value.
Polynomials are clearly not acceptable by this criterion.

Whilt they

readily form hump shapes, they do not settle down to an asymptotic value but

instead head off towards plus or minus infinity.

Of course, by choosing a

polynomial of sufficiently high degree we can pet a very close fit to the

data In the senseof generating a curve which comes close to the data
points. .A polynomial of degree equal to the number of data points less one

can be constructed that coincides exactly with each data point.

The

function Itself will fluctuate wildly between the data points and one would
have to be willing to believe that yields on bills ar'e coincidentally close

to one another only at the specific maturities which the Treasury happens

diverge even more rapidly.

Extensive analysis of spline results by Shea

(1982, 1984) shows that even when the fitted yield curve appears reasonable

within much of the maturity range of the data, the implied forward rates
display erratic bhavlor at the high end of the range.

A. class of models which does possess the properties we seek is that

humped shapes as well as monotonic shapes.

Some theories of the term structure of interest rates imply forward
rate equations of this form.

The classical expectations theory equates

forecasts of short rates, which might be represented by a stochastic
difference equation, to forward rates.

Richard (1978) studied a model in

which the term structure depends on two state variables: the real rate and

the rate of inflation.

Under certainty the forward rate function in

Richard's model has precisely the above form if the two state variables
each obey a first order differential equation.

Under uncertainty the

forward rate is a more complex function of exponentials.

While we do not

these considerations add to the presumption that this is a class of models
worth investigating.

Implementation of this model presents some practical difficulties
because of the interchangeability of (81,t1) and iD2I2); if the numerical

values of those pairs of parameters are switched around we have the same

function, a potential source of computer confusion.

implemented model with similar shape characteristics has the form

This function arises as the solution to the second order difference
equation in the case of equal roots, or alternatively may be derived as an
approximation to the solution in the unequal roots case by replacing one of

the two exponential terms by its Taylor's series expansion (Appendix A).
The parameters of this model are more easily estimated because the model is

linear in B,

and 2 for any provisional value of 1..

Model (2.1) may also be viewed as a constant plus a Laguerre Eunction,
which

suggests a method for generalization to higher—order models.

Laguerre Functions consist of a polynomial, times an exponential decay term

and are a mathematical class of approximating functions; details may be
found (for example) in Courant and Hilbert (1953, pp..

While

higher order models could generate more complex shapes, it is

not hard to show that even the second order model given above has
considerable shape flexibility and is therefore parsimoneous.

Note that

r(0)is (B0+Bi) and the limiting value of r(m) as m gets large is simply B0

Shapes produced by vertically

one integrates r(*) in (2.1) from zero to m and divides by m.

as m gets large is B and as m gets small is (So+Bj) which are necessarily
the same as for the forward rate function since Rim) is just an averaging
of r(*).

The range of shapes available for Rim) depends again on a single

Allowing a to take on valuès'from —6 to 12 in equal increments generates

the shapes displayed In Figure 3 which include humps, 9—ihapes, and
monotonic curves.

On the basis of the range of shapes available to us in

the second order model our operating hypothesis is that we will be able to

capture the underlying relationship between yield and term to maturity
without resorting to more complex models involving more parameters.

points.

In some cases the standard deviation is reduced slightly because

the constrained model fits about as well and uses one less parameter.

The

ability to fit humps seems to have been quite important until the twenty—

fourth data set (from January 1981 until October 1982) after which point

the shape of the yield curve seems to have become simpler and monotonic.
Thus there appears to be a persistence of shape over time.

Note that this

change in shape also seems to be associated with less dispersion in
residuals. Did the Federal Reserve start to stabilize interest rates again

in late 1982?

A casual inspection of the behavior of the federal funds

rate over this period certainly suggests that it did.

4.

Analysis of Residuals: Maturity and Issue Effects

Plots of fitted yield curves against the data have suggested some
dependence of residuals along the maturity axis.

We would like to try to

determine whether this is due to a systematic influence of maturity on
yield which our model is unable to capture.

If such an effect persists

through time then we should be able to detect it in the average of the
thirty—seven residuals corresponding to a specific maturity.

Figure 12 is

a vertical stack of residual plots for the thirty—seven data sets with
averaged

the

separated by intervals of 200 basis points and the scale for the averaged

residuals is lagnified by ten. The last data set appears at
stack.

Note that the first averaged

the top of the

residual, corresponding to 17 days

maturity, is positive, the second negative, followed by a rising pattern to

Just under ninety days, a sharp drop, then a rising pattern again to just
under 180 days and another sharp drop. This is seen more clearly in Figure

13 where the magnified scale shows that these maturity effects are in the

range —5 to +5 basis points which is large relative to a rough standard
deviation of 1.2 basis points.

We surmise that the positive yield effect

at 17 days is due.to higher tranmaction costs per unit time for shorter

17

term bills.

Ihe fitted curve is pulled upward by this data point, leaving

the next point below the curve.

We also surmise that the peak at 87 aays

maturity and sharp drop following is due to the fact that 90 days is the
maturity of a substantial portion of the bills issued by the Treasury and
will therefore bulk large in the inventory on dealers shelves.

Similarly,

the Treasury tssues 180 day bills and 360 day bills and indeed we observe
the averaged residual rising to a peak at each of these maturities. To our

knowledge, these supply effects have not been previously documented nor

would they be apparent if our models did not impose quite a bit of
smoothness on the yield curve.

A purchaser of bills may or may not find

these maturity premiums sufficiently attractive to influence maturity
choice, but at least they are now visible.

Issue effects are distinguished from maturity effects in •that they
pertain to the bills which mature on a particular date rather than to bills

with a pirticular term to maturity.

The issue of bills maturing on

December 31, 1981 were 339—day bills on our first quote sheet (January 22,

1981); became 311—day bills on our second quote sheet (February 19, 1981)

28 days later, and lo on through the months until they appear as 29—day
bills on the November 27, 1981 quote sheet. This gives us twelve residuals

for this particular issue of bills.

Other issues will appear initially

with only 178—days to maturity which gives us six residuals until the issue
matures and disappears.

The plots of residuals are lined up in Figure 14

so that each issue may be followed through time.

Averages are plotted at

the bottom with the scale enlarged by a factor of three; these averages are

shown on a larger scale In Figure 13.

There is some evidence in these

plots that issue effects exist since large residuals for a particular issue

do.

The particular bond chosen is the 12—3/4 percent coupon U.S. Treasury

bond maturing in 2010 (callable in 2O0) since this was the longest bond

appearing on all our quote sheets. A bond can of course be viewed as a
bundle of bills with maturities spaced at six month intervals until the
