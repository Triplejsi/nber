Who Pays Cigarette Taxes? The Impact of Consumer Price Search
Philip DeCicca, Donald S. Kenkel, and Feng Liu
NBER Working Paper No. 15942
April 2010
JEL No. H22,I18
ABSTRACT
We conduct an empirical study of the impact of consumer price-search on the shifting of cigarette
excise taxes to consumer prices. We use novel data on the prices smokers report actually paying for
cigarettes. We document substantial price dispersion. We find that cigarette taxes are shifted at lower
rates to the prices paid by consumers who undertake more price search – carton buyers, and especially,
smokers who buy cartons of cigarettes in a state other than their state of residence. We also find suggestive
evidence that taxes are shifted at slightly higher rates to the prices paid by non-daily smokers, less
addicted smokers, and smokers of light cigarettes.

1. Introduction
Economists emphasize that the behavior of buyers and sellers in market, not
statutes, determines who really pays a tax (Fullerton and Metcalf 2002). For excise
and sales taxes, one of the most basic questions is whether taxes are shifted forwards
to consumers, or backwards to suppliers and factors of production. A general
principle is that taxes tend to be shifted away from the economic agents most able to
change their behavior in response to the tax. For example, in a competitive industry
with free entry and exit and perfectly elastic supply, in equilibrium the tax is shifted
away from suppliers, towards consumers. Empirical studies of the most common
excise taxes in the U.S. – taxes on alcohol, cigarettes, and gasoline – usually conclude
that they are fully shifted to consumers. In fact, most studies of alcohol and cigarette
taxes find that they are over-shifted, i.e passed through to consumer prices at a rate
higher than one-for-one.1 Empirical studies also conclude that general sales taxes are
fully shifted to consumer prices, with evidence of over-shifting in some markets.2

1

Cook (1981), Young and Bielinska-Kwapisz (2002), and Kenkel (2005) find
evidence that alcohol excise taxes are over-shifted. Similarly, Barzel (1976), Johnson
(1978), Sumner and Ward (1981), Keeler et al. (1996), Delipalla and O’Donnell
(2001) and Hanson and Sullivan (2009) find evidence that cigarette excise taxes are
over-shifted. In contrast to previous research, Harding, Leibtag, and Lovenheim
(2010) use unique transaction-level data and find under-shifting for both alcohol and
cigarette taxes. Alm, Senoga, and Skidmore (2009) find evidence that in urban states
gasoline taxes are fully passed through to prices, but their estimates suggest that in
rural states gasoline taxes are under-shifted.
2

Poterba (1996) finds that sales taxes are shifted to retail prices of clothing
and personal care items at a rate of about one-for-one. Besley and Rosen (1999) find
evidence of tax over-shifting in about half of the 12 goods markets they study.
1

The observed over-shifting in many goods markets is consistent with theoretical
analyses of tax shifting under oligopoly and imperfect competition.3
The standard approach in empirical studies of the shifting of excise and sales
taxes is to compare prices across markets with different tax rates, observing a single
price (e.g. the average price) in each market.4 However, there can be substantial
within-market dispersion in the prices paid by consumers. In a review of research on
the extent of price dispersion in various markets, including on-line markets, Baye,
Morgan, and Scholten (2006, pp.44-45) conclude that: “price dispersion is ubiquitous
and persistent....[and] is still the rule rather than the exception....” Search-theoretic
models help explain why price differences are not completely arbitraged away. Like
equilibrium tax shifting, the behavior of buyers and sellers in markets, including
buyers’ search behavior, determines equilibrium price dispersion.
In this paper we conduct an empirical study of the impact of price-search
behaviors on the shifting of cigarette excise taxes to consumer prices. Theoretical
models and empirical research suggest that consumer price search is especially
common for frequently purchased items like cigarettes. In addition to the price search
common in many markets, cigarette consumers can shop for volume discounts by
buying cartons instead of packs, and they can even cross state borders to avoid excise
3

In market conditions other than perfect competition, theory predicts a number
of possible outcomes, including both over- or under-shifting of taxes to consumer
prices (Katz and Rosen 1985, Stern 1987, Besley 1989).
4

Of the 13 studies cited in footnotes 1 and 2, 10 use data with a single price
per market. Kenkel (2005) and Hanson and Sullivan (2009) use data with multiple
prices, collected from surveys of retailers. Harding, Leibtag, and Lovenheim (2010)
use transaction-level prices from scanner data.

taxes (Lovenheim 2008, DeCicca, Kenkel and Liu 2010). If more price-sensitive
consumers engage in more search, the general principle of tax shifting implies that
cigarette excise taxes will be shifted at a lower rate to the prices paid by consumers
who engage in more search. However, to the best of our knowledge, previous public
finance and health economics research has not explored the impact of price-search
behavior on tax shifting, either in general or for the cigarette market in particular.
We use novel data from the 2003 and 2006-07 cycles of the Tobacco Use
Supplements to the Consumer Population Survey (TUS-CPS). The TUS-CPS
contains data on the prices paid for cigarettes by a national pooled sample of about
60,000 smokers. As described in more detail in section 2, our first contribution is
simply to document that cigarette prices show substantial dispersion that is not
entirely due to differences in state- or local-taxes. The TUS-CPS also contains data
on some behaviors consumers adopt to lower the prices they pay for cigarettes,
including buying by the carton instead of the pack and buying cigarettes across state
borders. Consumers who adopt these behaviors report paying substantially lower
prices for cigarettes.
In section 3 we use the TUS-CPS data to examine the degree to which state
cigarette excise taxes are shifted to consumers who engage in different search
behaviors. Consistent with previous estimates, for the full sample we find evidence
that taxes are fully shifted to consumer prices. However, the average rate of shifting
masks substantial differences by search behavior. We estimate that the rate at which

3

taxes are shifted to consumer prices is only 0.79 for the prices paid by home-state
carton buyers, and only 0.26 for the prices paid by away-state carton buyers.
In section 4, we take a different cut at the data and explore whether tax
shifting is related to smoking behavior. We find that taxes are shifted to consumer
prices at about the same rates across most groups of smokers, but there is some
evidence of slight over-shifting to non-daily and less-addicted smokers and smokers
of light cigarettes. Combined with the results of the Section 3 model, the empirical
evidence suggests that for tax shifting, search behavior appears to be more important
than smoking behavior.
Section 5 concludes and discusses directions for future work.
2. Cigarette Price Dispersion
The 2003 and 2006-2007 cycles of the TUS-CPS provide novel data on the
prices consumers report actually paying for the cigarettes they purchased, and on
some price-search behaviors. The Tobacco Use Supplements (TUS) have been
sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and administered as part of the Current
Population Survey (CPS), the U.S. Census Bureau's continuing labor force survey
(Hartman et al. 2002, US Department of Commerce, Census Bureau 2006). Questions
about cigarette prices were included in the 2003 cycle (conducted in February, June,
and November 2003) and the 2006 - 2007 cycle (conducted in May and August 2006
and January 2007). Smokers were asked to report how much they paid for their last
pack or carton of cigarettes, after using discounts or coupons. Smokers were also
asked whether they usually buy their cigarettes by the pack or by the carton, whether

4

their last purchase was in their state of residence or some other state, and whether they
bought cigarettes over the internet or by other means. We use these responses to
create four mutually exclusive categories of smokers: pack buyers; home-state carton
buyers; away-state carton buyers; and buyers over the internet or other means.5 Our
analysis samples consist of about 32,000 smokers from the 2003 TUS-CPS and about
28,000 from the 2006-2007 TUS-CPS.
Table 1 describes the TUS-CPS data on cigarette prices. Cigarette prices are
standardized as price per pack.6 In addition to average prices paid, Table 1 also
reports the coefficient of variation (the mean divided by the standard deviation),
which is a common measure of price dispersion (Baye, Morgan and Scholten 2006).
For the full sample of reported prices paid, the coefficient of variation is about 33
percent in 2003 and 36 percent in 2006 - 2007. This degree of price dispersion is
roughly comparable to that seen for other goods (Baye, Morgan and Scholten 2006,
Table 1a). For example, Lach (2002) find coefficients of variation from 11 to 20
percent for coffee prices in Israel, and Scholten and Smith (2002) find coefficients of
5

About five percent of smokers report that they usually buy both packs and
cartons; we categorize them as pack buyers. We pool home-state and away-state pack
buyers together, because of relatively small samples of away-state pack buyers (about
450 smokers in each TUS cycle). About 2.5 percent of smokers, mainly non-daily
smokers, report that they usually do not buy their own cigarettes, so they do not report
prices and are not included in our analysis.
6

We also imposed consistent top-coding across the 2003 and 2006-2007 TUSCPS data. In the 2003 survey coding, the highest possible prices were $9.99 per pack
and $99.99 per carton. In the 2006 - 2007 survey coding, the highest possible prices
were $99.99 per pack and $999.99 per carton. Imposing the 2003 top codes involved
less than one percent of the 2006 - 2007 sample (226 observations) and did not change
most empirical results. However, if we do not impose the 2003 top codes, the
calculated coefficient of variation is much higher in 2006 - 2007.

variation from 2 to 42 percent for the prices of consumer sundries in Bloomington,
Indiana retail markets.
Looking across price-shopping behaviors, in round numbers about 65 percent
of smokers report buying packs, about 30 percent report buying cartons of cigarettes
in their home state, another 3 percent report buying cartons of cigarettes in another
state, and less than one percent report buying cigarettes over the internet or by other
means. Compared to consumers who buy cigarettes by the pack, consumers who buy
cartons in their home state report paying about $1.00 less per pack, or about 25
percent less. Consumers who travel across state borders to purchase their cartons of
cigarettes report paying even lower prices. The small number of consumers who
report that they buy their cigarettes over the internet or by other means report the
lowest prices paid.7 Measured price dispersion is not too different across pack
buyers, home-state carton buyers, and non-home state carton buyers. There is greater
dispersion in the prices paid by consumers who report buying their cigarettes over the
internet or by other means. This is not surprising, because by definition this category
appears inherently more heterogeneous.

7

The low prevalence of internet purchases might seem surprising, and could
reflect TUS-CPS respondents’ reluctance to report actions of questionable legality.
As Goolsbee, Lovenheim, and Slemrod (2007) point out, there is very little systematic
evidence about the volume of internet cigarette sales. Goolsbee, Lovenheim and
Slemrod estimate a model of state taxable cigarette sales that includes a measure of
internet penetration in the state. Their model implies that, compared to a counterfactual with no internet sales, in 2000 internet sales reduced home-state cigarette sales
by 3.3 percent.
6

Part of the observed price dispersion in the TUS-CPS data reflects variation in
state excise taxes on cigarettes. In a simple descriptive regression (not reported but
available upon request), variation in state excise taxes explains 33 percent of the
variation in prices paid (i.e. the R2 = 0.33). Of the remaining variation, an additional
11 percent is explained by adding to the descriptive regression indicator variables for
home-state and away-state carton buyers. The improvement in the R2 to 0.44 is
substantial in the context of a large microdata set.
Because the TUS-CPS is representative by state, we can also examine the
average price and coefficient of variation by state (Appendix Table). The coefficients
of variation for cigarette price paid across states are in a fairly narrow range from
around 20 to 40 percent. The price dispersion within most states is only slightly less
than the price dispersion in the entire sample, again suggesting that excise tax
differences do not drive all of the measured price dispersion.8
We can also compare the TUS-CPS state-average prices to the average price
by state reported in the Tax Burden on Tobacco [TBOT] (Orzechowski and Walker
2008). TBOT is the standard source of cigarette price data used in virtually every
study of U.S. cigarette demand. The two state-average price series are highly
correlated ( r = 0.94), but the TBOT state-average prices are systematically higher.9
8

In some states, localities impose additional excise taxes. Some of the withinIllinois price dispersion is due to sizeable taxes imposed by Chicago and Cook
County. Some of the within-New York price dispersion is due to the sizeable tax in
New York City. A number of other cities and counties, mainly in Alabama, Missouri,
and Virginia, also impose local taxes, but these are very small.
9

The methodology of the TBOT price series is not reported, so we can only
speculate why the prices are systematically higher. Possible reasons the TBOT prices
7

We only observe some of the sources of the observed dispersion in the TUSCPS cigarette price data. While the TUS-CPS instructed consumers to report the
price paid after using discounts or coupons, it did not collect information on who used
discounts and coupons. The TUS-CPS also did not collect information on brand
preferences. The cigarette market includes standard-priced brands such as Marlboro
and Camel and discount and deep discount brands (Bulow and Klemperer 1998).
From several sources, we estimate that discounted sales and sales of discount brands
account for about 30 percent of total sales. The price differences due to discounts and
brand choice are about $1.00 per pack, the same size difference as we report in Table
2 for pack- versus- carton buyers. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that
these unobserved factors alone would lead to a coefficient of variation in prices of
about 12 percent, substantially below the 33 - 36 percent we observe in the TUS-CPS
price data.10 Finally, we note that consumers may pay different prices for the exact
might be higher include: they do not include the volume discounts for carton
purchases; they do not reflect other price discounts and coupons; or they come from
an unrepresentative sample of retailers. Even after we restrict the TUS - CPS sample
to include only pack prices, the TBOT prices are still about $0.30 per pack higher than
the TUS-CPS state average prices. As discussed below and in footnote 10, price
discounts and coupons are probably not common enough and large enough to explain
the differences between the state-average prices. Future work could explore the
implications of measurement error in the TBOT price series for previous estimates of
the price-elasticity of cigarette demand.
10

In supermarket scanner data from 49 geographic markets from 1997 - 2005,
Lillard and Sfekas (2010) report that discounted sales make up just under two percent
of total sales, with the average discount offer being worth about $1.00 per pack. The
price difference between standard and discount brands also appears to be about $1.00
per pack (authors’ calculations from Euromonitor 2003). For the back-of-theenvelope calculation, based on Euromonitor’s (2003) market report we assume that 72
percent of smokers buy standard brands at an average price of about $4.00 per pack
and 28 percent buy discount brands at an average price of about $3.00 per pack.

same brand, and there may be idiosyncratic differences in self-reports of the price
paid for cigarettes. Although we can not observe these other sources, the results in
Table 2 demonstrate important price differences associated with the search behaviors
we observe.
3. Tax Shifting and Price-Shopping Behaviors
To describe tax shifting, we follow Poterba (1996) and Belsey and Rosen
(1999) and estimate reduced-form equations that show the price paid by consumer i in
state s as a function of the tax rate T and a vector X of demand- and supply-shifters, to
which we add a vector S of search-cost shifters:
(1)

Pis = β0 + β1 Ts + β2 Xis + β3 Sis + εis

The main focus of our analysis is on our estimates of β1. In our linear specification,
full shifting of taxes to consumer prices implies β1 = 1.
Table 2 contains the definitions and means of the explanatory variables, and
the sources for the state-level variables. The tax T is measured as the tax rate in the
state of purchase. The vector X includes individual characteristics such as age,
schooling, and income, indicators for size of the metropolitan area, region of

Based on Lillard and Sfekas (2010), we assume that two percent of all purchases
involve a discount of about $1.00 per pack, and that only standard brand purchases are
discounted. Assuming that 70 percent of the sample pays $4.00 per pack and 30
percent of the sample pays $3.00 per pack yields a coefficient of variation of 0.12. Of
course, there is additional dispersion from several sources. Interestingly, the market
report claims that: “Standard cigarettes in the US display little or no price variation
between brands....Price variation is instead determined by what state the consumer
lives in, and what channel is being used for the purchase. Therefore, a pack of
Marlboros is likely to be the same price as a pack of Camels within the same store”
(Euromonitor 2003, p. 3).
9

residence, and survey year. 11 The vector S includes state-level variables that may shift
price search-costs: an indicator for whether the state has a minimum price law for
cigarettes; and the per capita density of retail outlets that sell cigarettes. However,
our reduced-form approach does not allow us to give purely structural interpretation
to the elements of the estimated vectors β2 and β3.
To describe the extent to which excise taxes are shifted to consumer cigarette
prices on average, we first estimate equation (1) for the full sample, where we have
pooled together the 2003 and 2006 - 2007 data. To describe the impact of price
search on tax shifting, we next estimate equation (1) over different sub-samples: pack
buyers; home-state carton buyers; and away-state carton buyers.12 Like standard
empirical tax incidence studies, our approach is, in a sense, descriptive. We take
observed search behaviors as given (exogenous), and describe the rates at which taxes
are shifted to the prices paid in equilibrium by different groups of consumers.
Table 3 contains estimates of equation (1) for the full sample and different
sub-samples. Our point estimate of 1.02 implies that on average, state cigarette excise
taxes are very slightly over-shifted to consumer prices; we can not reject the
hypothesis that the rate of shifting is 1. We find that cigarette taxes are under-shifted
11

In additional specifications (not reported but available upon request) we add
state fixed effects to X, or alternatively a measure of state anti-smoking sentiment
(DeCicca et al. 2008). The patterns of results are similar to those reported in Table 3,
with somewhat lower estimated pass-through rates.
12

Table 2 includes another group who report buying their cigarettes over the
internet or by other means. We do not estimate equation (1) for this sub-sample
because even pooling together the 2003 and 2006 - 2007 data provides a sample of
less than 300 observations.
10

to the prices paid by consumers who engage in more price search. For consumers
who buy cartons in their home state, taxes are shifted to prices at an estimate rate of
0.79. For consumers who buy cartons in a state other than their state of residence, the
estimated rate of shifting rate is 0.26. Because we measure tax in the purchase tax,
this result means that not only do these consumers avoid their higher home-state
cigarette tax, but that the lower away-state tax is not fully shifted to the price they
paid. For both groups of carton buyers, we can reject the hypothesis that the rates of
shifting equal 1.0. These patterns are consistent with the general principle of tax
shifting, that taxes are shifted away from economic agents who are most able to
change their behavior.
We do not find evidence that the search-cost shifters – state minimum price
laws and cigarette retail outlet density – are statistically significantly related to the
prices consumers report paying. In addition to their possible effect on the conditional
mean prices in the regression, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the search costshifters might also increase price dispersion (variance). In other words,
heteroskedasticity is a prediction, not just a potential problem. We report
heteroskedastic-consistent standard errors (from Stata’s robust command), so it is not
a problem for the results reported in Table 3. When we test for heteroskedasticity, our
results support the prediction that higher cigarette retail outlet density reduces
cigarette price dispersion.13
13

Although the relationship between the number of sellers and price dispersion
is “model specific” in theory, Baye, Morgan and Scholten (2006, p. 40) review several
empirical studies that find that more competition reduces dispersion.
11

Although they can not be given structural interpretations, the estimated effects
of the other explanatory variables in equation (1) are also interesting. Compared to
white smokers, Black and Hispanic smokers on average pay about $0.30 more (almost
ten percent more) per pack. Residents of the largest cities (with populations over 2.5
million) pay an additional $0.34 more per pack. The price paid also tends to decrease
with age and increases with schooling and income. The patterns for age, schooling,
and income might mainly reflect brand preferences rather than differences in price
search; for example, younger smokers are more likely to smoke the higher-priced
premium brands (Cummings et al. 1997). Perhaps reflecting economies of scale in
price search, smokers who live in households with other smokers report paying lower
prices.
4. Tax Shifting and Smoking Behavior
Instead of categorizing smokers by their search behavior, in this section we
take several different cuts at the data, based on smoking behaviors. The priceelasticity of demand might tend to vary with smoking behavior. At the same time, the
benefits and costs of consumer price search might also tend to vary with smoking
behavior. As in section 3, our approach is to describe the rates at which taxes are
shifted to the prices paid in equilibrium by different groups of consumers, now
defined by their smoking behaviors.
Table 4 reports the estimated pass-through rates (i.e., the estimated coefficient
β1 on the tax variable) from our re-estimates of equation (1) for the new sub-samples
defined by smoking behaviors. Complete results are available upon request. In the

12

first panel of Table 4, smokers are categorized as: non-daily smokers; daily light
smokers; daily moderate smokers; and daily heavy smokers. In the second panel, we
categorize smokers based on whether they report attempting to quit smoking within
the past year, and whether they report seriously planning to quit smoking within the
next six months. In the third panel of Table 4, we take a slightly different cut and
categorize smokers by a proxy for their degree of addiction. To measure the degree of
addiction to smoking, the TUS-CPS and other health surveys ask smokers: “How
soon after you wake up do you typically smoke your first cigarette of the day?” In the
fourth and fifth panels of Table 4, we categorize smokers by their choices of light
cigarettes versus regular cigarettes, and menthol versus non-menthol cigarettes.
The point estimates tend to suggest that taxes are somewhat over-shifted to
non-daily smokers, less addicted smokers, and smokers of light cigarettes: the
estimated rates of pass-through to prices paid are 1.12, 1.11, and 1.13 respectively.
Similarly, there appears to be a slight gradient with quitting behavior and intents:
taxes are passed through at a slightly higher rate (1.04) to smokers who report quit
attempts and intents. However, none of these estimates in Table 4 is statistically
significantly different than 1. For the other groups of smokers, the estimated passthrough rates are always about 1. The suggestive pattern is a little surprising, because
it might be expected that heavier and more addicted smokers are less able to adjust
their behavior in response to taxes. However, this might be offset by more price
search, so that in equilibrium we observe some tendency for cigarette taxes to be
shifted more towards lighter smokers.

13

5. Conclusion
Using novel data on reported prices paid for cigarettes, we find that cigarette
excise taxes are shifted at lower rates to the prices paid by consumers who undertake
more price search behavior – carton buyers, and especially, smokers who buy cartons
of cigarettes in a state other than their state of residence. Although generally search
behavior seems to matter more than smoking behavior for tax shifting, we also find
suggestive evidence that taxes are shifted at slightly higher rates to the prices paid by
non-daily smokers, less addicted smokers, and smokers of light cigarettes. Echoing
the basic economic insight that taxes do not necessarily stay where legislatures place
them, our results sound some cautions for cigarette tax policy. In equilibrium,
cigarette excise taxes may be differentially shifted towards groups of consumers
whose smoking is of less concern for policy (e.g. non-daily and less addicted
smokers).
Future work could take several directions, depending upon data availability.
Our descriptive analysis of tax shifting in equilibrium could be extended by
embedding the analysis in a structural model of the jointly endogenous choices of
price search and smoking on the demand side, as well as modeling the supply side of
the retail cigarette market. A structural approach would provide predictions about
consumer behavior under new tax policies and environments and allow a more
complete policy analysis (Heckman and Vytlacil 2005). For example, because we
estimate that cigarette taxes are under-shifted to the prices paid by cigarette cartonbuyers, some policy advocates might be tempted to consider a special tax on cartons.

14

However, the endogenous sorting of pack- versus carton-buying means that it might
not be possible to exploit the observed equilibrium relationship between price search
and tax shifting. The same market forces could keep the new tax from being fully
shifted too. Although structural estimation addresses this limitation in principle, in
practice identification would be challenging. In particular, it would be difficult to find
suitable instrumental variables to separately identify search behaviors and smoking
behavior and to identify behavior on the supply-side of the market.
Another direction for future work is to explore the implications of price search
for the incidence of cigarette taxes across income groups. Standard analyses conclude
that because smokers have lower incomes in the U.S., cigarette taxes are regressive
(Lyon and Schwab 1995, Colman and Remler 2008). These standard analyses are
incomplete if taxes are differentially passed through to the prices paid by consumers
with different incomes. Indeed, Heiding, Leibtag and Lovenheim (2010) find that
cigarette taxes are fully shifted to the prices middle-income consumers pay, but less
than fully shifted to the prices paid by both low- and high-income consumers. Future
work could further explore the role of consumer price search in these patterns of tax
incidence and income.
