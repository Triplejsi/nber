The Economics of International Differences in Educational Achievement

ABSTRACT
An emerging economic literature over the past decade has made use of international tests of educational
achievement to analyze the determinants and impacts of cognitive skills. The cross-country comparative
approach provides a number of unique advantages over national studies: It can exploit institutional
variation that does not exist within countries; draw on much larger variation than usually available
within any country; reveal whether any result is country-specific or more general; test whether effects
are systematically heterogeneous in different settings; circumvent selection issues that plague within-country
identification by using system-level aggregated measures; and uncover general-equilibrium effects
that often elude studies in a single country. The advantages come at the price of concerns about the
limited number of country observations, the mostly cross-sectional character of available achievement
data, and possible bias from unobserved country factors such as culture.
This chapter reviews the economic literature on international differences in educational achievement,
restricting itself to comparative analyses that are not possible within single countries and placing particular
emphasis on studies trying to address key issues of empirical identification. While quantitative input
measures show little impact, several measures of institutional structures and of the quality of the teaching
force can account for significant portions of the immense international differences in the level and
equity of student achievement. Variations in skills measured by the international achievement tests
are in turn strongly related to individual labor-market outcomes and, perhaps more importantly, to
cross-country variations in economic growth.

“If custom and law define what is educationally allowable within a nation,
the educational systems beyond one’s national boundaries
suggest what is educationally possible.”
Arthur W. Foshay (1962) on the first pilot study
of international student achievement

1. Introduction
Virtually all nations of the world today realize the research and policy value of student
performance data that come from testing the cognitive skills of students. While there is wide
variation across nations in testing – differing by subject matter, grade level, purpose, and quality
of testing – the idea of assessing what students know as opposed to how long they have been in
school has diffused around the world, in part at the instigation of international development and
aid agencies. Somewhat less known is that comparative cross-national testing has been going on
for a long time. Nations participated in common international assessments of mathematics and
science long before they instituted national testing programs. These common international
assessments provide unique data for understanding both the importance of various factors
determining achievement and the impact of skills on economic and social outcomes.
International consortia were formed in the mid-1960s to develop and implement
comparisons of educational achievement across nations. Since then, the math, science, and
reading performance of students in many countries have been tested on multiple occasions using
(at each occasion) a common set of test questions in all participating countries. By 2010, three
major international testing programs are surveying student performance on a regular basis: the
Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) testing math, science, and reading
performance of 15-year-olds on a three-year cycle since 2000, the Trends in International
Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) testing math and science performance (mostly) of
eighth-graders on a four-year cycle since 1995, and the Progress in International Reading
Literacy Study (PIRLS) testing primary-school reading performance on a five-year cycle since
2001. In addition, regional testing programs have produced comparable performance
information for many countries in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, and international adult
literacy surveys have produced internationally comparable data on the educational achievement
of adults.
In a variety of cases, these international assessments actually substitute for national testing.
The international testing provides information on educational outcomes where otherwise only
small, unrepresentative samples of outcome data are available. Indeed, the simplest of
international comparisons has spurred not only governmental attention but also immense public
interest as is vividly documented by the regular vigorous news coverage and public debate of the
outcomes of the international achievement tests in many of the participating countries. For
example, the results of the first PISA study made headlines on the front pages of tabloids and
more serious newspapers alike: the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (Dec. 4, 2001) in Germany
titled “Abysmal marks for German students”, Le Monde (Dec. 5, 2001) in France titled “France,
the mediocre student of the OECD class”, and The Times (Dec. 6, 2001) in England titled “Are
we not such dunces after all?”

These international assessments, which are generally embedded within a larger survey of
individual and school attributes, are ultimately valuable in providing direct measures of human
capital. The idea that individual skills are important in a wide variety of economic and social
circumstances is generally captured under the blanket term of human capital. Since the
influential work of Schultz (1961), Becker (1964), and Mincer (1970), the concept of human
capital has pervaded many economic analyses.1 But the challenge has consistently been to find
explicit measures that could be used in empirical analysis. Simply identifying, for example,
differences in the labor-market outcomes for individuals as human capital does not provide a
useful empirical structure. The invention of Mincer (1970, 1974) was to pursue the empirical
power of defining human capital in terms of school attainment, an easily measured factor that
almost certainly related to skill development and human capital. This idea has subsequently
dominated most thinking about human capital such that school attainment is often taken virtually
as a synonym for human capital.
The fundamental problem with this development is that it very frequently ignores other
elements of skill development that will generally be related to school attainment. For example, a
large body of work, generally under the rubric of educational production functions, focuses on
the concomitant influence of families in the skill development of children. Moreover, much of
the concern about governmental investments in schooling, particularly in developed countries,
focuses on issues of differential quality. Both of these factors and other omitted elements are
very likely to be related to the school attainment of individuals.2 While there has been
considerable research aimed at getting consistent estimates of the rate of return to school
attainment, little of this has addressed issues of systematic omitted determinants of human
capital.3
Much of our motivation for the analysis described in this paper comes from the conclusion
that cognitive skills, identified by test scores such as those incorporated into the international
assessments, are good measures of relevant skills for human capital. Thus, in looking at the
impacts of human capital on economic outcomes, instead of attempting to identify all of the
relevant determinants of differences in individual or aggregate skills, we simply begin with
measures of cognitive skills as our indication of human capital. Along the way, however, we
also discuss the alternatives to this along with providing evidence about the appropriateness of
different measures.
The research based on the international assessments goes in two different directions:
research designed to understand the underlying determinants of cognitive skills and research
focused on the consequences of skill differences. Our purpose here is to review and evaluate
both lines of research employing international assessments.

1

As traced by Kiker (1968), the antecedents of human capital analysis go much farther back including Petty (1676
[1899]) and Smith (1979), but the idea went dormant with the arguments against it at the beginning of the 20th
Century by Alfred Marshall (1898).
2
For general discussions of these issues, see Hanushek (2002) and Hanushek and Woessmann (2008). For the
quality-attainment relationship, see Hanushek, Lavy, and Hitomi (2008).
3
For an evaluation of alternative approaches to estimation of returns to schooling, see Card (1999, 2001). The
interpretation of such estimates as an internal rate of return is discussed in Heckman, Lochner, and Todd (2006,
2008). The more general interpretation of the determinants of human capital is found in Hanushek and Woessmann
(2008) and Hanushek and Zhang (2009) along with the discussion below.

1.1 Unique Advantages of Cross-Country Data on Cognitive Skills
International achievement data, developed and refined over the past half century, were not
collected to support any specific economic research agenda. But, as we shall discuss below,
there are a number of research and policy agendas that are uniquely amenable to analysis
because of the existence of such data. Indeed, it is somewhat peculiar to have a handbook
chapter focus on specific data as opposed to issues of economic methodology or substantive
research and policy areas. We argue, however, that such data have made it possible for
economists to address a range of fundamental questions that previously resisted satisfactory
analysis. And, because the extent and nature of international achievement data still remain
largely unknown, it is important to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of these data in
understanding a variety of significant research and policy questions.
In terms of understanding the determinants of educational achievement, the international
data have at least six unique advantages over research restricted to single countries or states.
First, the data permit exploitation of variation that only exists across countries. For example,
systematic institutional variation between countries as found with differences in the
competitiveness and flexibility of teacher labor markets, forms of accountability systems, the
extent of a private school sector, or the structure of student tracking simply does not exist within
most countries. Or, the existence of central exit exams is a national characteristic in nearly all
countries, so that the effect of central exams cannot be estimated using national data in these
countries unless their status changes over time. The lack of within-country institutional variation
makes an empirical identification of the impact of many institutional features of school systems
impossible when using national datasets.
Second, even where within-country variation exists, variations across countries in key
institutional factors and in characteristics of the schools and population are frequently much
larger than those found within any country. From an analytical viewpoint, using such
international variation generally implies increased statistical power to detect the impact of
specific factors on student outcomes.
Third, the international achievement data based on the same data collection process provides
an opportunity to examine comparable estimates of the determinants and consequences of
educational achievement for a diverse set of countries. Such research can thus throw light on
whether a result is truly country-specific, applies more generally, or is simply a spurious result
from a particular within-country sample.
Fourth, and related to the previous point, international evidence can identify systematic
heterogeneity in effects that differ across countries. For example, such comparative research can
delve into why class-size effects on achievement are heterogeneous across countries, perhaps
leading to deeper insights about, say, the interaction between curriculum or teacher training and
classroom processes.
Fifth, even where within-country variation exists, for example, in the case of public and
private schools operating within the same system, comparisons of student achievement are often
subject to severe selection problems. Students who choose to attend a private school may differ
along both observable and unobservable dimensions from students taught in neighborhood public
schools. While it is possible to control for some differences in student, family, and school
characteristics when estimating the effects of institutional structures, thereby comparing students
who are observationally equivalent, such estimates may still suffer from selection on unobserved
3

characteristics. By aggregating the institutional variables to the country level, it is possible to
circumvent these selection problems – in effect measuring the impact of, for example, the share
of students in a country attending private schools on student achievement in the country as a
whole. Such cross-country evidence will not be biased by standard issues of selection at the
individual level.
Sixth, uncovering general equilibrium effects is often impossible in a single country but
sometimes feasible across countries. For example, the presence of private schools may influence
the behavior of nearby public schools with which they compete for students. As a result, simple
comparisons of private and public schools may miss an important part of the effects of greater
private involvement in education. Aggregated measures of the institutional feature can solve the
problem: By comparing the average performance of systems with larger and smaller shares of
private schools, the cross-country approach captures any systemic effect of competition from
private schools.
Research into the consequences of differences in cognitive skills has similar advantages.
For example, while the implications of human capital development for macroeconomic outcomes
– including, importantly, economic growth – can potentially be investigated with time-series data
for individual countries, historical data are effectively limited to school attainment with no
information on the cognitive skills that we emphasize here. On the other hand, variations in
cognitive skills across different economies can, as we describe below, effectively get at such
fundamental questions. Similarly, investigating whether features of the structure of economic
activity affect the individual returns to skills is very difficult within a single economy with
interlocking labor and product markets.
1.2 Concerns with the Use of Cross-Country Data on Cognitive Skills
With these research advantages also come concerns and disadvantages. Three stand out.
First, the relevant variations are frequently limited by the number of countries with both
assessment and other common data. Second, even though each of the assessments collects
substantial amounts of ancillary survey information at the individual level, virtually all are single
cross-sectional designs with no ability to track individuals.4 Third, there is frequently a concern
that unmeasured “cultural” factors are important in various processes of interest. Each of these
make the identification and estimation of cross-country models difficult and limit the range of
analyses currently possible.
Further, while not specific to this cross-country work, some inherently difficult data and
modeling problems also remain. The focus of this chapter is measures of educational
achievement – skills that are expressed in test scores – rather than quantitative measures of
educational attainment. For reasons of availability, the focus of our skill measurement is just on
cognitive skills, opening up possible concerns about other skills such as non-cognitive skills.
The systematic measurement of such skills has yet to be possible in international comparisons.
Furthermore, the research covered refers to basic general skills that are generally learned through
the end of secondary school, leaving aside programs of higher education and specific vocational
skills. Apart from data availability, this focus is also dictated by a need for international

comparability where measures of any quality aspects of higher education are generally
unavailable.5
1.3 Scope of this Analysis
The standards of evidence throughout empirical economics have changed in recent years,
sometimes dramatically. The character of change also enters directly into our consideration of
cross-country analyses. The analytical designs employed in the cross-country analyses we
discuss have developed over time in a way that parallels much of the related micro-econometric
work within individual countries. The initial publications of comparative tests across nations by
the organizations that conducted the different studies tended to report bivariate associations.
Subsequent analyses performed multiple regressions in the form of educational production
functions and cross-country growth regressions that tried to address the most obvious perils of
bias from intervening factors by adding corresponding control variables. While initial studies
estimated international educational production functions at the aggregate country level,
subsequent studies exploited the full variation of the international micro data.
More recently, several studies have started to employ econometric techniques such as
instrumental-variable, regression-discontinuity, differences-in-differences, and different sorts of
fixed-effects specifications in order to come closer to identification of causal relationships in the
international data on educational achievement. This applies both to the identification of causal
effects within countries and to the challenge of overcoming possible bias from unobserved
country heterogeneity – e.g., in terms of cultural differences – in cross-country estimation.
While these developments are far from complete at this time, we emphasize the issues of
identification and interpretation in much of the discussion below.
We limit the coverage of this chapter to studies that make cross-country comparisons.
Based on this criterion, we cover only studies that estimate the same specification for different
countries or estimate a cross-country specification. Studies that use the international survey data
for analysis within a single country will be referenced only insofar as they are directly relevant
for the internationally comparative approach.
The next section provides a brief economic motivation to frame the subsequent discussions.
Section 3 gives an overview and critical assessment of the different available international
datasets on educational achievement. Section 4 surveys the literature on the determinants of
international educational achievement, covering both evidence within different countries and
evidence across countries and covering family background, school resources, and institutional
structures as three groups of possible determinants. Section 5 surveys the literature on the
economic consequences of international educational achievement, covering both individual

A couple of attempts have been made to analyze differences among universities, but these are generally limited.
There are academic rankings of the world’s research universities by the Institute of Higher Education, Shanghai Jiao
Tong University, based on measures of university research (for 2007, see
http://ed.sjtu.edu.cn/rank/2007/ARWU2007TOP500list.htm accessed January 12, 2008). A 2007 professional
ranking by the Ecole des mines de Paris considered graduates who were CEOs at Global Fortune 500 countries (see
http://www.ensmp.fr/Actualites/PR/EMP-ranking.html accessed January 12, 2008). Neither would appear to
provide very general measures of higher education outcomes in different countries, and each also is subject to the
same concerns that human capital is developed in more places than just schools.

labor-market outcomes and macroeconomic growth. The final section presents some overall
conclusions along with a discussion of how the data and research could be improved.

2. Economic Motivation
A wide variety of analyses motivate the discussions here. They are most easily described as
models falling under the rubric of human capital, although that nomenclature has become so
widely used that it does not provide any clear description.
In general terms, the literature reviewed in Section 5 thinks of economic outcomes as
determined by human capital – or relevant skills – and a variety of other factors. The canonical
case, which we deal with extensively here, is where the economic outcome is individual labormarket earnings. (More generally, relying on some underlying models of markets, earnings
might reflect the productivity of individuals in that labor market). This simple view is expressed
by:
(1)

O = γ H + Xβ +ε

where O is the outcome of interest, H is human capital, X is a vector of other determinants of the
outcome, and ε is a stochastic term. In the standard labor-market view of earnings determination,
everything is measured at the individual worker level, O is simply individual earnings, and X
includes such things as labor-market experience of the worker, gender, and health status.
The empirical issue is how to measure human capital, or H. Almost without comment, it is
now commonplace simply to substitute school attainment, S, for human capital and to proceed
with estimation of the underlying model. This approach is reinforced by the ubiquitous
availability of measures of school attainment, a common addition to population censuses,
household surveys, and other specialized data collections in nations around the world.
Assuming that school attainment is a measure of human capital, however, requires a series
of strong assumptions, ones that conflict with other well-developed lines of research. Most
relevant, analyses of educational production functions have considered the outcomes of schools
within a broader model of production. Specifically, these models identify skills as being affected
by a range of factors including family inputs (F), the quality and quantity of inputs provided by
schools (qS), individual ability (A), and other relevant factors (Z) which include labor-market
experience, health, and so forth as in:
(2)

H = λ F + φ (qS ) + η A + α Z +ν

The schooling term combines both school attainment (S) and its quality (q).
Human capital is, however, not directly observed. To be verifiable, it is necessary to specify
the measurement of H. Estimating versions of equation (2), the literature reviewed in Section 4
concentrates on the cognitive-skills component of human capital and considers measuring H with
test-score measures of mathematics, science, and reading achievement. The use of measures of
cognitive skills has a number of potential advantages. First, achievement captures variations in
the knowledge and ability that schools strive to produce and thus relate the putative outputs of
schooling to subsequent economic success. Second, by emphasizing total outcomes of
education, these models incorporate skills from any source – families, schools, and ability.
6

Third, by allowing for differences in performance among students with differing quality of
schooling (but possibly the same quantity of schooling), they open the investigation of the
importance of different policies designed to affect the quality aspects of schools.
The implications of this perspective for the estimation of equation (1) are immediately
obvious. Estimation that incorporated just school attainment (S) would yield biased estimates of
the impact of human capital except in the most unlikely event that S is actually uncorrelated with
the other determinants of skills.
The issues are perhaps most relevant when considering aggregate outcomes. In considering
the impact of human capital on aggregate output or on economic growth, comparing a year of
schooling across countries implies assuming that the learning per year is equivalent, say, from
Hong Kong to South Africa. Few people would think that is a reasonable assumption.
We investigate the value of international measures of achievement for the analysis of both
equations (1) and (2). For some estimation and analysis, international data are clearly not
needed. For example, the extensive study of educational production functions has for the most
part been conducted entirely within countries. Our focus here is very specific. We wish to
consider analyses that are not possible within single countries or that provide extended analytical
possibilities when put in an international framework. For example, as we discuss later, a variety
of educational institutions are constant within individual countries – such as the use of early
tracking systems – and thus are not susceptible to analysis within individual countries.
Alternatively, understanding differences in economic growth across countries requires reliable
cross-country data.

3. International Tests of Educational Achievement
The beginning of international testing was a series of meetings in the late 1950s and early
1960s when a group of academics met to design an international testing program.6 An
exploratory study in testing mathematics, reading comprehension, geography, science, and nonverbal ability was conducted in 1959-1962 (cf. Foshay (1962)). This led to the first major
international test in 1964 when twelve countries participated in the First International
Mathematics Study (FIMS). This and a series of subsequent assessments were conducted in a set
of nations voluntarily participating in a cooperative venture developed by the International
Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA). The continuing IEA efforts
have been more recently matched by an on-going testing program from the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
3.1 Overview of Available International Testing and Participation
These international testing programs, and related ones that we discuss below, are marked by
some common elements. They involve a group of voluntarily participating countries that each
pay for their participation and administer their own assessments (according to agreed-upon
protocols and sampling schemes). Since they involve individual country policy decisions to
participate, the set of participating countries has differed across time and even across subparts of
6

specific testing occasions. Additionally, the different tests differ somewhat in their focus and
intended subject matter. For example, the IEA tests, of which the most recent version is the
Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), are developed by international
panels but are related to common elements of primary and secondary school curriculum, while
the OECD tests (Programme in International Student Assessment, or PISA) are designed to
measure more applied knowledge and skills.7 The range of subject matters tested varies across
time, with assessments in math and science being supplemented by reading tests.8 Third, until
recent testing, little effort has been made to equate scores across time. Finally, the testing has
been almost exclusively cross-sectional in nature, not following individual students’ change in
achievement.9
Along with the assessments of cognitive skills, extensive contextual information and student
background data have been provided by related surveys. The motivation for this is using the
international databases to address a variety of policy issues relevant to the participating
countries.
The IEA and OECD tests have the broadest coverage and have also adapted regular testing
cycles. Table 1 provides an account of their major international tests with an indication of age
(or grade level) of testing, subject matter, and participating countries. By 2007, there were 15
testing occasions, most of which include subparts based upon subject and grade level.10
The major IEA and OECD testing programs have expanded dramatically in terms of
participating countries. While only 29 countries participated in these testing programs through
1990, a total of 96 countries have participated by 2007. Three additional countries participated
in 2009, and another three additional countries plan to participate in 2011, raising the total
number of countries ever participating in one of these international tests to 102. Only the United
States participated in all 15 testing occasions, but an additional 17 countries participated in ten or
more different assessments. Figure 1 shows the histogram of participation on the IEA or OECD
tests between 1964-2007, divided by OECD and other countries. From this figure, it is clear that
the depth of coverage is much greater for developed than for developing countries. Further,
much of the participation in one or two different test administrations occurs after 2000. On the
other hand, those countries participating eight or more times have now accumulated some
information on intertemporal patterns of performance with testing going back to the early 1990s
or before.
At the same time, a number of more idiosyncratic tests, some on a regional basis, have also
been developed. These tests have been more varied in their focus, development, and quality.
And they have in general been used much less frequently in analytical work. Table 2 provides
7

A separate analysis of coverage and testing can be found in Neidorf, Binkley, Gattis, and Nohara (2006).
There have also been some other studies of foreign languages, civic education, and information technology. These
have involved smaller samples of countries and in general have not been repeated over time. We do not include
these in our discussions, in part because they have not been analyzed very much.
9
The Second International Mathematics Study (SIMS) of the IEA did have a one-year follow-up of individual
students that permitted some longitudinal, panel information, but this design was not repeated. Recent innovations
have permitted development of panel data by individual countries.

basic information on these additional assessments, although most of the remaining portion of this
chapter concentrates on the information from tests in Table 1. Of the ten additional testing
occasions, six are regional tests for Latin America (ECIEL, LLECE, SERCE) or Africa
SACMEQ I and II, PASEC). As discussed below, the IEA and OECD tests may be too difficult
for many students in the developing countries of Latin America and Africa, thus providing
unreliable information about performance variations. These regional examinations use tests that
are more appropriate to the countries of the region.
The remaining assessments and surveys cover a broader set of countries but are somewhat
different in focus from those in Table 1. The International Assessment of Educational Progress
(IAEP) I and II are tests constructed to mirror the National Assessment of Educational Progress
(NAEP) that has been used in the United States since 1970 and that aligns to the United States
school curriculum, which may limit international comparability. The International Adult
Literacy Survey (IALS) and the Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey (ALLS) have a very
different structure involving sampling of adults in the workforce.11 The IALS survey data in
particular have been used in a variety of studies about the consequences of education and
cognitive skills (and will be discussed below in that context).
Given the different test designs, can results be compared across countries? And can the
different tests be aggregated? Interestingly, the TIMSS tests with their curricular focus and the
PISA tests with their real-world application focus are highly correlated at the country level. For
example, the correlation coefficients between the TIMSS 2003 tests of 8th graders and the PISA
2003 tests of 15-year-olds across the 19 countries participating in both are 0.87 in math and 0.97
in science, and they are 0.86 in both math and science across the 21 countries participating both
in the TIMSS 1999 tests and the PISA 2000/02 tests. There is also a high correlation at the
country level between the curriculum-based student tests of TIMSS and the practical literacy
adult examinations of IALS (Hanushek and Zhang (2009)). Tests with very different foci and
perspectives tend to be highly related, suggesting that they are measuring a common dimension
of skills. As discussed below, the consistency lends support to aggregating different student tests
for each country in order to develop comparable achievement measures. It is also encouraging
when thinking of these tests as identifying fundamental skills included in “human capital.”
As an example of the different international tests, Table 3 provides comparative information
on country performance on the major worldwide tests of math at the lower secondary level. The
more recent tests have been normed to have a mean of 500 and standard deviation of 100. But,
because the group of countries going into the norm differs and because there is no attempt to
equate scores across time, it is not possible to say that a country with an average of 510 in one
year and 515 in another has improved or not. We return to this issue below.
3.2 Validity of International Sampling and Testing
The available international tests of educational achievement are not without criticism. In
particular, despite the stringent technical standards and extensive efforts of quality assurance by
the international testing organizations (e.g., Organisation for Economic Co-operation and

11

The OECD has currently also embarked on a new endeavor, the Programme for the International Assessment of
Adult Competencies (PIAAC), which will update and expand the adult testing, in terms of both the scope of the test
and the number of participating countries. This assessment is scheduled to be administered in 2011.

Development (2009)), in principle differences in sample selectivity across countries clearly have
the potential to undermine the validity of specific country rankings on the tests. While critics of
international educational comparisons argue that results may be influenced by differences in the
extent to which countries adequately sample their entire student populations (e.g., Rotberg
(1995); Prais (2003)), others disagree with the view that sample selection is a major source of
bias in international achievement comparisons (e.g., Baker (1997); Adams (2003)).
In any case, the extent to which such sample selection affects results of econometric
analyses that use the international test score data (rather than just leading to mismeasurement of
country mean performance) depends on whether it is idiosyncratic or systematic and on the
extent to which it is correlated both with (conditional) outcomes and determinants of the
analyses. If sample selectivity is idiosyncratic, it simply introduces classical measurement error
that works against finding statistically significant associations.12 The same is true if sample
selectivity is persistent across time but orthogonal to the (conditional) variable whose association
with test scores is of interest. Only if it is correlated with the error term of the estimation
equation does systematic sample selectivity introduce bias to econometric analyses.13
In order to test the extent to which this is true, Hanushek and Woessmann (2010b) draw on
detailed information on sampling quality provided in the more recent international tests and
estimate whether international differences in sample selection affect the outcomes of typical
economic analyses. They show that countries having more schools and students excluded from
the targeted sample (e.g., because of intellectual or functional disabilities or limited proficiency
in the test language), having schools and students who are less likely to participate in the test
(e.g., because of unwillingness to participate or absence on the testing day), and having higher
overall school enrollment at the relevant age level indeed tend to perform better on the
international tests. However, accounting for this sample selectivity does not affect the results of
standard growth regressions and education production functions. This finding implies that the
international variation in selectivity of student samples is not systematically related to the
associations of interest in the economic analyses reviewed in this chapter.
The tests included in our analyses have been devised in an international cooperative process
between all participating countries with the intent of making the assessments independent of the
culture or curriculum in any particular country. Yet, another criticism that is sometimes raised
against international comparisons of student achievement is that test items may be culturally
biased or inappropriate for specific participating countries (e.g., Hopmann, Brinek, and Retzl
(2007)). Adams, Berezner, and Jakubowski (2010) show that overall country rankings are
remarkably consistent when countries are compared using just those PISA-2006 items that

12

The importance of this will be lessened in applications that use averages of performance across several tests, since
the error variance is reduced by averaging.
13
Studies such as Hanushek and Woessmann (2009a) that include country fixed effects deal with possible bias from
systematic sampling errors by removing time-invariant factors for each country. They also show that changes in
enrollment rates over time are uncorrelated with trends in test scores, diluting worries that differential changes in
enrollment bias the results of economic analyses using test scores.

10

representatives of each specific country had initially expressed to be of highest priority for
inclusion, and presumably most appropriate for their own school system.14
The summary is that international testing is now well-established and broadly accepted. The
assessments, particularly in Table 1, plus their corresponding survey information form the basis
for the cross-country analyses discussed here.

4. Determinants of International Educational Achievement
In reviewing the economic literature on international educational achievement, this section
focuses on its determinants and the next section on its consequences. After a brief introduction
to the estimation of international education production functions, this section covers student
background, school inputs, and institutional structures of the education system as three groups of
factors determining achievement. Note that the analysis is weighted toward developed countries,
largely mirroring the time pattern of participation where developing countries have until very
recently participated infrequently. At the same time, since most international analyses of the
determination of achievement rely just on the cross-sectional data, it might be expected that this
balance will change in the near future.
4.1 International Evidence on Education Production Functions
As is the case in the majority of the literature on educational production, the basic model
underlying the literature on determinants of international educational achievement resembles
some form of the education production function:
(3)

T = a 0 + a1 F + a 2 R + a3 I + a 4 A + e

which basically is a version of our equation (2) applied to students currently in school. Here, T is
the outcome of the educational production process as measured, e.g., by test scores of
mathematics, science, and reading achievement. The vector F captures facets of student and
family background characteristics, R is a vector of measures of school resources, I are
institutional features of schools and education systems, and A is individual ability.
When estimating equation (3) within different countries, studies based on international data
face the same methodological challenges as studies restricted to a specific country (see Hanushek
(1979, 2002) and Todd and Wolpin (2003) for key issues in empirical identification of education
production functions). The fundamental challenge is that most inputs in the education
production function are likely not to be exogenous in a statistical sense. Leading concerns derive
from omitted variables, selection, and reverse causation. A key candidate of an omitted variable
is student ability A, most dimensions of which tend to go unmeasured and are likely correlated
with other inputs in important ways. An additional concern for research on most of the
international tests is their cross-sectional structure which does not allow for panel or value-added
estimations, so that temporally prior inputs are usually unobserved. School inputs will often be

14

From the opposite perspective, the IAEP comparisons (not employed here) were built on tests directly taken from
the assessments used in the United States, but the results from these comparisons did not alter the low ranking of
U.S. students (see Lapointe, Mead, and Phillips (1989)).

11

the outcome of choices of parents, administrators, and schools that are correlated with the error
term of the production function. The same is true for some institutional characteristics. Given
this substantial scope for endogeneity bias, least-squares estimates of equation (3) need to be
interpreted with great care, even when they control for a large set of observable input factors.
This has led to the development of more elaborate techniques that try to draw on exogenous
variation in the variables of interest.
In the following review of the literature, we will refer to the more descriptive studies only
briefly and mostly focus on studies trying to address the key identification issues. There is,
however, one specific aspect about making cross-country comparisons of estimates obtained
from performing the same estimation in different countries, though: If one is willing to make the
assumption that any bias is constant across countries, then a cross-country comparison of
estimates is feasible, even if interpretation of the size of each estimate is not.
The main challenges change when it comes to studies estimating cross-country associations.
As discussed in the introduction to this chapter, there are both unique advantages and specific
concerns with using cross-country data to estimate the determinants of educational achievement.
At the most general level, cross-country estimation is able to get around the most pressing
concerns of bias from selection but introduces new kinds of omitted variable concerns. Withincountry variation is often subject to severe selection problems: For example, students who
choose to attend a private school may differ along both observable and unobservable dimensions
from students taught in neighborhood public schools. While many observable characteristics are
often controlled for in econometric analyses, thereby comparing students who are
observationally equivalent, within-country estimates may still suffer from selection on
unobserved characteristics.15 In cross-country analyses, one can aggregate the institutional
variable of interest up to the country level, thereby circumventing the selection problem. In
effect, the cross-country analysis then measures the impact of, for example, the share of students
in a country attending private schools on student achievement in the country as a whole. Such
cross-country analysis cannot be biased by standard issues of selection at the individual level, as
patterns of sorting cancel out at the system level.
The main cost to this – apart from the limited degrees of freedom at the country level – is
that unobserved heterogeneity at the country level may introduce new forms of omitted variable
bias. For example, cultural factors such as “Asian values” may remain unobserved in the
econometric model and correlate both with student outcomes and relevant inputs in the education
production function. Education systems – and societies more generally – may also differ in other
important dimensions unobserved by the researcher. To address such concerns, the main results
of cross-country studies should be checked for robustness to including obvious correlates of the
cultural factors as control variables at the country level. Another robustness check is to draw
only on variation within major world regions by including regional (continental) fixed effects.
More fundamentally, some cross-country studies have started to adopt new techniques directly
developed to address such issues of identification in particular contexts, and these studies will be
the main focus of the following review.

15

There is, for example, an extensive literature within the U.S. on private school choice and the potential problems
with student selection (see, for example, Coleman and Hoffer (1987); Coleman, Hoffer, and Kilgore (1981); Neal
(1997); Altonji, Elder, and Taber (2005)).

12

Early studies that employ the international student achievement tests to estimate similar
education production function within different countries include Heyneman and Loxley (1983)
and Toma (1996). Early studies using the cross-country variation of international tests to
estimate international education productions on country-level observations include Bishop
(1997), Hanushek and Kimko (2000), and Lee and Barro (2001). The first economic study to
make use of the vast potential of the international micro data on students’ achievement, family
background, and school inputs and of the broad array of institutional differences that exists
across countries to estimate extensive multivariate cross-country education production functions
is Woessmann (2003b). While still subject to the prior issues of cross-country identification,
employing the rich student-level data on background factors allows to hold constant a large set of
observable factors usually unavailable in national datasets.
Table 4 presents an example estimation of an international education production function.16
Using student-level data for 29 OECD countries from the 2003 cycle of the PISA test of 15-yearolds, the model expresses individual student achievement in math as a function of large set of
input factors. While this is a basic model that does not fully exploit the potential of the
international data, the model specification already documents the rich set of background factors
available from the student and school background questionnaires. Moreover, the international
data display wide variation in many of the potential inputs to achievement, thus allowing for
more precise estimation of any effects. At the individual level, the factors include student
characteristics such as age, gender, immigration, and preprimary educational attendance and
family-background measures such as socio-economic status, parental occupation, family status,
and the number of books in the home. At the school level, the model includes resource measures
such as class size and shortage of materials, instruction time, teacher education, community
location, and institutional factors such as a set of measures of teacher monitoring and student
assessment, different dimensions of school autonomy, and their interaction with accountability
measures. At the country level, this basic model includes a country’s GDP per capita,
educational expenditure per student, and the institutional factors of external exit exams, share of
privately operated schools, and average government funding of schools.
While the cross-sectional nature of this estimation allows for a descriptive interpretation
only, it is worth noting that many measures of students’ individual and family background are
systematically related to their achievement, as are several measures of the institutional structure
of the school system. By contrast, the point estimate on class size, the classical measure of
quantitative school inputs, is counterintuitive,17 and the estimates on the more qualitative school
inputs, while positive, are more limited than the background and institutional estimates. The
model accounts for 39 percent of the achievement variation at the student level and for 87
percent at the country level. That is, while unobserved factors such as ability differences are
important at the individual level, the model is able to account statistically for most of the
between-country variation in academic achievement. These basic result patterns are broadly
common to all studies of international education production functions estimated on the different

16

See Woessmann, Luedemann, Schuetz, and West (2009) for additional background and robustness analyses.
The coefficient on country-level spending is very small. While it is statistically significant, identification here
comes from a very particular margin, as the correlation between spending and per-capita GDP (whose coefficient is
negative here) in this model is as high as 0.93. Other studies tend to find a significant positive coefficient on GDP
per capita, but not on spending. See below for more extensive discussion.

international student achievement tests.18 We will now discuss the literature on each of the three
groups of determinants – student and family background, school inputs, and institutions – in
greater detail.
4.2 Student and Family Background
The results of the international education production function just presented show strong
associations of educational achievement with many measures of student and family background.
Given the importance of learning and child development outside school, family inputs have long
been viewed as a leading input in educational production. As a consequence, consideration of
measures of family background is generally taken as the most rudimentary quality standard when
analyzing effects of school inputs (cf. Hanushek (2002)). But the effects of different measures of
student and family background are generally seen as having important interest in their own right,
not least because they provide an indication of the equality of opportunity of children with
different backgrounds (see the chapter by Björklund and Salvanes (2010)). When using
international student achievement data to estimate the same basic specification in different
countries, measures of equality of opportunity can be compared across countries for several
dimensions such as social background, ethnicity and immigrant status, and gender. Moreover,
estimates of how strongly student achievement depends on family background provide an
indication of intergenerational mobility of a society. We first discuss evidence derived from
estimation within different countries and follow with evidence across countries.
Figure 2 depicts an example, based on Schuetz, Ursprung, and Woessmann (2008), of using
international data to generate comparable estimates of the association between family
background and educational achievement in different countries. By combining the 1995 TIMSS
test with its 1999 repeat study, the study can draw on micro data for over 325,000 students from
a total of 54 countries. For the OECD countries, the figure depicts the coefficient on books
available in the student’s household in a student-level regression predicting the average 8th-grade
test score in math and science disaggregated by country. By controlling for the immigration
status of student, mother, and father interacted with family background (as well as age, gender,
and family status), the multivariate analysis ensures that the estimates are not driven by crosscountry differences in the immigrant population, but reflect socio-economic differences in the
non-migrant population of each country.
The number of books in the students’ home is used as a proxy for socio-economic
background not only because cross-country comparability and data coverage are superior to such
indicators as parental education, but also because books at home are the single most important
predictor of student performance in most countries (Woessmann (2003b, 2008)). The
sociological literature suggests books at home as a powerful proxy for the educational, social,
and economic background of the students’ families. Furthermore, Schuetz, Ursprung, and
Woessmann (2008) corroborate the cross-country validity of the books-at-home variable by
showing that the association between household income and books at home does not vary
significantly between the six countries for which both income and books measures are available
in the PIRLS dataset. At the same time, it is important to be clear about the interpretation. The
consistency of the estimates across studies is not meant to imply that books in the home per se
18

See Aghion et al. (2007) and Aghion (2008) for an example of an international education production function in
higher education, using university rankings based on the Shanghai research ranking (see above).

14

are causally related to achievement and that providing more books to families would raise
student performance. Books in the home proxy systematic differences in parenting, home
education, and home resources that are presumed to be causally related to performance. In other
words, the specific measures are not causally related to achievement even if the underlying
concept is.19
The association between the family-background measure and student achievement is
statistically significant at the 1 percent level in every country in Figure 2. The size of the
estimates indicates how much students’ test scores, measured in percentage points of an
international standard deviation, increase when raising the number of books at home by one
category. For example, in England the difference in educational achievement between children
of families with more than two bookcases of books and children of families with only very few
books at home (the two extremes of the five available categories) is 1.15 standard deviations, or
more than three times what students on average learn during a whole school year.20 While the
estimated family-background effect differs substantially across countries, the socio-economic
difference equals roughly one grade-level equivalent even in France, the OECD country with the
lowest estimate. The United States falls in the top quarter of the most unequal OECD countries,
whereas Canada belongs to the group of most equal countries. By estimating the same
association in 54 countries, the study provides an index of inequality of educational opportunity
that permits comparisons of the intergenerational educational mobility across countries.
Obviously, specific country results may be sensitive to the specific background measure and
TIMSS dataset. On the other hand, analytical results on the cross-country association of
education policies with equality of opportunity are consistent when using an index of socioeconomic status as an alternative background measure and when estimated with the PISA dataset
(Woessmann, Luedemann, Schuetz, and West (2009)).
Table 5 provides a detailed overview of studies using international tests to estimate the
association between several student background measures and educational achievement in
different countries. Education production functions that include several measures of student and
family background in a way comparable across countries have been estimated for groups of
countries in East Europe (Ammermueller, Heijke, and Woessmann (2005)), East Asia
(Woessmann (2005a)), West Europe and the United States (Woessmann (2008) using TIMSS,
Peterson and Woessmann (2007) using PISA), and Latin America (Woessmann (2010a)).
Special attention to the relative performance of students with immigration background in
different countries is given in Entorf and Minoiu (2005) and Schnepf (2007). Zimmer and Toma
(2000) and Ammermueller and Pischke (2009) focus on effects of peers’ background on student
achievement in different countries. Bedard and Dhuey (2006) and Sprietsma (2010) analyze the
effect of relative school starting age. Wolter and Coradi Vellacott (2003) look at sibling rivalry
in different countries. Jenkins, Micklewright, and Schnepf (2008) calculate measures of
between-school social segregation in different countries. In each case, these studies make use of
the cross-country structure of the data to compare the size of the association of the specific
background measure with student achievement across countries. In general, the studies find that
19

A similar interpretation but in a different context can be seen from the use of family income to proxy behavior and
family outcomes (cf. Mayer (1997)). A similar point about the causal impact of parental education is made by
Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2005).
20
On these tests, one grade-level equivalent equals roughly 35 percent of a standard deviation (see Schuetz,
Ursprung, and Woessmann (2008)).

15

educational achievement differs substantially by student and family background within the
separate countries, but also that there is substantial variation in the influence of families across
countries. Section 4.4 below will review studies that relate such measures of equity of
educational achievement to institutional differences in the education systems across countries.
When estimating the association between socio-economic background and economic
achievement, the literature has been generally interested in overall associations, irrespective of
their origin. Methodologically, most of the cross-country literature on background effects so far
is thus descriptive in nature. At the same time, not much headway has been made on the
underlying causal mechanisms, such as the relative roles of nature and nurture in these
associations. However, lacking obvious reasons to assume that natural transmission differs
across countries, cross-country comparisons can be interpreted in terms of differences in the
extent to which societies achieve more or less equal educational opportunities. Differences in
the estimates across countries can thus still be correlated with different national features to
estimate relevant policy parameters (see below).
As the studies covered in Table 6 testify, the strong association between students’ socioeconomic background and their educational achievement is also confirmed in cross-country
studies, estimated both at the country level (Lee and Barro (2001)) and at the student level
(Woessmann (2003b) using TIMSS, Fuchs and Woessmann (2007) using PISA).21 (Table 6
reports results on family backgrounds and school inputs together because most studies estimating
cross-country associations deal with both at the same time.) On more particular subjects,
Gunnarsson, Orazem, and Sánchez (2006) use variation across Latin American countries in the
LLECE test to estimate the effect of child labor on student achievement. They exploit crosscountry variation in truancy regulations to identify exogenous variation in the opportunity cost of
children’s time in a cross-country instrumental variable model. McEwan and Marshall (2004)
and Ammermueller (2007) perform decomposition analyses of the variation between two
countries to estimate the extent that family-background measures can account for achievement
difference between Cuba and Mexico and between Finland and Germany, respectively.
For questions of specific background factors, the literature has also used more elaborate
identification techniques. For example, Bedard and Dhuey (2006) use the variation created by
national cutoff dates for school enrollment to derive exogenous variation in relative school
starting ages. The relative school starting age assigned by national cutoff date is consequently
used as an instrument for the actual relative school starting age of the students.22 Zimmer and
Toma (2000) make use of the specific structure of the SIMS study that included a one-year
follow-up to estimate value-added models when analyzing peer effects. More rudimentarily,
Woessmann (2010a) draws on retrospective reports on pre-school performance by parents in the
PIRLS study to estimate quasi-value-added models. In estimating peer effects, Ammermueller
and Pischke (2009) assume that classes within primary schools are randomly formed and

21

Jürges and Schneider (2004) employ a two-step approach to first estimate country fixed effects and then relate
them to country-level measures in TIMSS.
22
This strategy identifies effects of relative maturity at school entry. Leuven, Lindahl, Oosterbeek, and Webbink
(2010) is a study of the effect of absolute age at starting school. Bedard and Dhuey (2006) also indicate that the
cross-country pattern of results suggests that relative age effects may be less persistent in countries with limited
ability-differentiated learning groups during the primary grades. We will discuss the topic of tracking below.

16

accordingly employ school fixed effects estimation. They also address measurement error issues
by instrumenting the parent-reported variable by the same variable reported by the student.
In sum, measures of student and family background prove to be key factors in international
education production functions. A significant association of students’ academic achievement
with the socio-economic background of their families is evident in all countries around the
world. The variation in this association across countries, however, suggests that differences in
education policies might be an important element in differences in equality of opportunity, a
topic to which we return below.23
4.3 School Inputs
When moving from family to school determinants of educational achievement, the topic
most intensively researched are the inputs available in schools (Hanushek (2006)). As
exemplified in the international education production function shown in Table 4, measures of
school inputs include expenditure per student, class size, availability of instructional material,
and teacher characteristics. The studies reviewed in Table 6 reveal that in general, the crosscountry association of student achievement with resources tends to be much weaker than with
socio-economic backgrounds.
4.3.1 Evidence across Countries
When looking across countries, the most straightforward starting point is the simple
association between the aggregate financial measure of average expenditure per student and
average achievement. Figure 3 presents the international association between cumulative
spending per student from age 6 to 15 and the average math achievement of 15-year-olds on the
2003 PISA test. Without considering the strong outliers of Mexico and Greece, there is no
association between spending levels and average achievement across countries.24 At the most
basic level, countries with high educational spending appear to perform at the same level as
countries with low expenditures.
This picture has been evident in many other waves of the different international achievement
tests (e.g., Woessmann (2002), Section 3.2, for the 1995 TIMSS test). Furthermore, in most
cases the lack of a significant positive cross-country association between expenditure per student
and educational achievement holds up when numerous other determining factors such as family
background and school features (including instruction time) are accounted for in a regression
framework. Hanushek and Kimko (2000) and Lee and Barro (2001) perform country-level
regressions using different tests and Woessmann (2003b) and Fuchs and Woessmann (2007)
23

While our focus is on the effects of cognitive skills, other related work has delved into cross-country differences
in participation in higher education and its relationship to family background (see, for example, Orr, Schnitzer, and
Frackmann (2008)). The transition into higher education has at the same time been shown to be closely related to
student achievement.
24
With the two outliers, there is a weak positive association as long as other effects are ignored. Taken literally, the
full-sample association suggests that $60,000 per student in additional expenditure (a quadrupling of spending in the
low spending countries) is associated with about a half standard deviation improvement in scores. However, once a
country’s GDP per capita is controlled for, the cross-country association between student achievement and
expenditure loses statistical significance and even turns negative, suggesting that the bivariate association is driven
by the omitted factor of average socio-economic status.

17

perform student-level microeconometric regressions using TIMSS 1995 and PISA 2000,
respectively.
As discussed above, such cross-sectional analysis has to be interpreted cautiously, even
when controlling for a large set of factors. There may be reverse causality, and unobserved
country differences – e.g., cultural traits or institutional and political factors – may be correlated
with both inputs and outcomes. As a first step to address such worries, one can look at withincountry variation over time (Table 7). By looking at changes in inputs and outcomes, one can
rule out unobserved level effects. Thus, Gundlach, Woessmann, and Gmelin (2001) calculate
changes in expenditure and achievement for individual OECD countries from 1970-1994, and
Gundlach and Woessmann (2001) for individual East Asian countries from 1980-1994.25
The results, depicted in Figure 4, suggest that educational expenditure per student has
increased substantially in real terms in all considered OECD countries between the early 1970s
and the mid-1990s, and in all considered East Asian countries except the Philippines between the
early 1980s and the mid-1990s.26 Yet, comparing test scores over the same time intervals
suggests that no substantial improvement in average student achievement has occurred in any of
these countries. Combining the time-series evidence on resources and achievement, it is fair to
conclude that substantial increases in real school expenditure per student did not lead to
improvements in student outcomes in most of the sampled OECD and East Asian countries. In
fact, the experience of many countries is much bleaker than what had been termed the
“productivity collapse in schools” in the United States (Hanushek (1997)).27
Apart from the aggregate expenditure measure, the cross-country variation has also been
used to analyze specific resource inputs in cross-sectional analysis (see Table 6 for details).
Expenditure per student is an encompassing measure of school inputs which considers not only
personnel costs but also material costs. But international comparisons of expenditure may be
hampered by the problem of choosing an appropriate exchange rate (Figure 3 uses conversion by
purchasing power parities). Because personnel costs make up more than three quarters of total
expenditure in nearly all countries, class size lends itself particularly well as a non-monetary
input measure for international comparisons which determines a large part of total expenditure.
However, using class size instead of expenditure per student yields the same general picture as in
Figure 3. Regression analyses that control for family background measures come to similar
results. At the country level, Lee and Barro (2001) find a positive effect of smaller student25

Achievement data from the international tests at the two respective points in time are linked using U.S.
longitudinal achievement data. Increases in educational expenditure are adjusted not only for average inflation, but
also for the so-called “Baumol effect” of increasing costs in service sectors with constant productivity. Three
different approaches of calculating price deflators for the schooling sector that account for this effect are averaged in
the depiction of Figure 4. For details, see Gundlach, Woessmann, and Gmelin (2001), Gundlach and Woessmann
(2001), and Woessmann (2002), Section 3.3.
26
Gundlach and Woessmann (2001) show that the resource expansion in the East Asian countries mostly results
from government decisions to raise the number of teachers per student.
27
One potential explanation for this bivariate longitudinal pattern might of course be that students’ family
background might have deteriorated on average. Students may increasingly be lacking many of the basic
capabilities required for a successful education and may thus be increasingly expensive to educate. Such effects
may play a significant role in countries with a large inflow of immigrant students or with rising levels of poverty.
But on average, parents in the considered countries have been enjoying higher incomes and better education over
time, and the number of children per family has declined. Hence by the later periods, children may actually start
schooling with better basic capabilities than before. These issues, however, await thorough econometric analysis.

18

teacher ratios, but Hanushek and Kimko (2000) find no such relationship.28 However, countrylevel analysis may suffer from aggregation bias (Hanushek, Rivkin, and Taylor (1996)), as Fertig
and Wright (2005) show that the probability of finding statistically significant and correctly
signed class-size effects increases with the level of aggregation. Student-level analyses that use
data on the actual size of the class of the tested students, rather than ratios of teachers to students
at some level, tend to find counterintuitive signs of the coefficient on class size that are often
statistically significant (e.g., Woessmann (2003b); Fuchs and Woessmann (2007); Table 4
above).
The latter studies also take indicators of the shortage of instructional material, usually
reported by school principals, into account. Shortage of material tends to be negatively
associated with student outcomes. Measures of instruction time also tend to be significantly
related to achievement. By contrast, in multivariate analyses the availability of computers at
school is not related to student outcomes, and intensive computer use is negatively related to test
scores (Fuchs and Woessmann (2004)).
In the student-level studies, measures of teacher education tend to show positive associations
with student achievement in cross-country analyses. Drawing on information from teacher
background questionnaires in TIMSS, Woessmann (2003b) finds positive associations of student
achievement with teacher experience and female gender and a negative one with teacher age. In
their country-level analysis, Lee and Barro (2001) find a positive effect of teacher salary levels.
Similarly, Woessmann (2005b) reports a significant positive coefficient on a country-level
measure of teacher salary when added to an international student-level regression. Dolton and
Marcenaro-Gutierrez (2010) pool country-level data from international tests in 1995-2006 to
show that teacher salaries – both when measured in absolute terms and relative to wages in each
country – are positively associated with student achievement, even after controlling for country
fixed effects.
In sum, the general pattern of the cross-country analyses suggests that quantitative measures
of school inputs such as expenditure and class size cannot account for the cross-country variation
in educational achievement. By contrast, several studies tend to find positive associations of
student achievement with the quality of instructional material and the quality of the teaching
force. While these cross-country associations reveal to what extent different input factors can
descriptively account for international differences in student achievement, studies that focus
more closely on the identification of causal effects have reverted to using the within-country
variation in resources and achievement. This literature is most advanced for the estimation of
class-size effects. In the following, we discuss three approaches that have been suggested to
estimate causal class-size effects on international data: a combination of school fixed effects
with instrumental variables, a regression discontinuity approach that makes use of variation
stemming from maximum class-size rules, and a subject fixed effects approach.
4.3.2 Evidence within Different Countries
The initial within-country studies, reviewed in Table 7, have used conventional least-squares
techniques to focus on developing countries and their comparison to developed countries, a

particular advantage of using international data. Relying on data from early international tests,
Heyneman and Loxley (1983) suggested that school resources tend to be more closely related to
student achievement in developing countries than in developed countries. Hanushek and Luque
(2003) did not corroborate this conclusion using the more recent TIMSS data. Michaelowa
(2001) uses the regional PASEC data to provide conventional evidence for five countries in
Francophone Sub-Saharan Africa.29
The problem with such conventional estimates is that resources in general, and class sizes in
particular, are not only a cause but also a consequence of student achievement or of unobserved
factors related to student achievement. Many features may lead to the joint and simultaneous
determination of class size and student achievement, making class size endogenous to student
achievement. For example, schools may reduce class sizes for poorly performing students and
policymakers may design compensatory funding schemes for schools with large shares of
students from poor backgrounds (see West and Woessmann (2006) for international evidence).
In both cases, class sizes are allocated in a compensatory manner, biasing the class-size
coefficient upwards. In contrast, policymakers may also have high-performing students taught in
special small classes to support elite performance. Likewise, parents who particularly care for
the education of their children may both make residential choices to ensure that their children are
taught in schools with relatively small classes and support their children in many other ways,
leading them to be relatively high performers. In these cases, class sizes are allocated in a
reinforcing manner, biasing the class-size coefficient downwards. In short, parents, teachers,
schools, and administrators all make choices that might give rise to a non-causal association
between class size and student achievement even after controlling extensively for family
background. Conventional estimates of class-size effects may thus suffer from endogeneity bias,
the direction of which is ambiguous a priori.
To identify causal class-size effects, two quasi-experimental strategies have been applied to
the international test data (cf. Woessmann (2005b)). The first quasi-experimental approach
draws on exogenous variation in class size caused by natural fluctuations in the size of
subsequent student cohorts of a school (similar to Hoxby (2000)). In this case, the quasiexperiment results from the idea that natural fluctuations in student enrollment lead to variations
in average class size in two adjacent grades in the same school. Natural birth fluctuations around
the cut-off date that splits students into different grade levels occur randomly. Therefore, they
lead to variation in class size that is driven neither by students’ educational achievement nor by
other features that might jointly affect class size and student achievement.
Woessmann and West (2006) develop a variant of this identification strategy that exploits
specific features of the TIMSS database. The sampling design of the first TIMSS study, which
tested a complete 7th-grade class and a complete 8th-grade class in each school, enables them to
use only the variation between two adjacent grades in individual schools. This strategy aims to
exclude biases from nonrandom between-school and within-school sorting through a
combination of school fixed effects and instrumental variables using grade-average class sizes as
instruments. The rationale of this approach is as follows. Any between-school sorting is
eliminated in a first step by controlling for school fixed effects, restricting the analysis solely to

Using PIRLS data, Woessmann (2010a) estimates a quasi-value-added model, controlling for retrospective
information on pre-school performance, for primary-school students in two Latin American and several comparison
countries.

20

variation within individual schools. Within schools, the allocation of students to different classes
in a grade may also be non-random. Within-school sorting is filtered out in a second step by
instrumenting actual class size by the average class size in the relevant grade in each school.
Within-school variation in class size is thus used only insofar as it is related to variation in
average class size between the 7th and 8th grade of a school. The identifying assumption is that
such variation is not affected by student sorting but reflects random fluctuations in birth-cohort
size between the two grades in the catchment area of each school. Thus, causal class-size effects
are identified by relating differences in the relative achievement of students in 7th and 8th grade
within individual schools to that part of the between-grade difference in class size in the school
that reflects between-grade differences in average class size.
Figure 5 illustrates the basic intuition behind this identification strategy for the example of
math achievement in Singapore. The top panel indicates that class-average test scores are
positively associated with class size, as is the case in most countries – likely reflecting ability
sorting of students between and within schools. The middle panel plots the achievement
difference between the 7th-grade and 8th-grade class in each school against the same grade
difference in class size, which is equivalent to including school fixed effects in a regression
framework. Overcoming effects of between-school sorting by removing any difference in
overall achievement levels between schools, the size of the positive correlation is reduced
substantially, but remains statistically significant. The reduction suggests that poorly performing
students tend to be sorted into schools with smaller classes in Singapore. The final step of the
identification strategy, illustrated in the bottom panel, additionally eliminates any effects of
within-school sorting by using only that part of the between-grade variation in actual class sizes
that can be predicted by variation in grade-average class sizes. The picture suggests that class
size has no causal effect on student achievement in math in Singapore. Rather, weaker students
seem to be consistently placed in smaller classes, both between and within schools.
Woessmann and West (2006) implement this identification strategy in microeconometric
estimations of education production functions for 11 countries around the world.30 In line with
Figure 5, their results suggest that conventional estimates of class-size effects tend to be severely
biased. They find sizable beneficial effects of smaller classes in Greece and Iceland, but reject
the possibility of even small effects in four countries and of large beneficial effects in an
additional four countries. Additional specification tests support the identifying assumption that
students and teachers are not systematically sorted between grades within individual schools.
There are no systematic differences at all in the observable characteristics of students or teachers
between the two grades in schools in which one of the two adjacent grades has substantially
larger average class sizes than the other; there are no systematic differences in the estimated
class-size effects between expanding, stable, and contracting schools; and there are no systematic
differences in the estimated class-size effects between countries where 7th grade is the first grade
of a particular school and countries where it is not so that grade-average class sizes might have
been adjusted based on schools’ experience with the particular students.
The basic pattern of results is corroborated by a second quasi-experimental identification
strategy based on rule-induced discontinuities. Following the study by Angrist and Lavy (1999)
30

Additional evidence based on the same identification strategy for countries in West Europe, East Europe, and East
Asia is presented in Woessmann (2005b), Ammermueller, Heijke, and Woessmann (2005), and Woessmann
(2005a), respectively.

21

for Israel, Woessmann (2005b) exploits the fact that many countries have maximum class-size
rules that induce a nonlinear association between the number of students in a grade of a school
and average class size. In particular, the association has sharp discontinuities at multiples of the
maximum class size that can be exploited to identify variation in class sizes that is exogenous to
student achievement. The TIMSS data suggest that 10 West European school systems
implement national maximum class-size rules reasonably strictly and with enough sharpness to
enable an empirical implementation of this instrumental variable strategy.31 In all 10 countries,
results from identification by rule-induced discontinuities rule out the possibility of large causal
class-size effects in lower secondary school. The only statistically significant, but small
estimates are, again, in Iceland and, marginally, in Norway.
Woessmann (2005b) shows that these results are robust to several specification tests. Some
models control for peer effects, in terms of the mean achievement and family background of each
student’s classmates, to exclude bias from peer sorting. Controlling for any continuous
association between grade enrollment and student achievement by adding enrollment in the
specific grade and its squared term as additional controls does not lead to substantive changes in
results. When applying the specification to a discontinuity sample of students whose grade
enrollment is within a margin of plus or minus 5 or 6 students of the rule-based discontinuities,
so that identification does not come from observations far off the discontinuities, the instrument
gets weak in about half the countries, while results remain robust in the other half. Excluding
especially large schools in each country (of a size three or four times the maximum class size)
does not lead to a substantive change in results.32
However, as discussed by Woessmann (2005b), some reservations remain with this
regression-discontinuity identification strategy (cf. also Urquiola and Verhoogen (2009)). In
particular, intentional exploitations of the rule by systematic between- and within-school choices
might lead to remaining endogeneity in the rule discontinuity approach. Thus, it is possible that
parents and schools “play the system”: parents particularly keen to ensure low class sizes for
their children may make their enrollment decisions – and school principals their acceptance
decisions – on the basis of expected class size, and those decisions may be related to student
achievement. Still, in the end both quasi-experimental identification strategies come to a very
similar pattern of results. Moreover, the source of the potentially remaining biases differs in the
two cases, adding confidence that any remaining bias in each strategy is of second-order
magnitude.
Both identification strategies reach the conclusion that class size is not a major force in
shaping achievement in lower secondary school in any of the countries considered. There is no
single country for which any of the specifications showed a statistically significant and large
class-size effect. In every case where one of the methods leads to a reasonably precise estimate,
a large effect size can be ruled out with considerable statistical confidence. There is only one
country, Iceland, where results create confidence that a causal class-size effects exists. However,
in both specifications the estimates are relatively small and estimated precisely enough to reject
the possibility of a large effect.

31

The ten West European school systems that employ maximum class-size rules are: Denmark, France, Germany,
Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.
32
The size of the induced discontinuity in class size is smaller when grade enrollment is larger.

22

The unique value of cross-country research, however, lies in analyses of whether the crosscountry differences in estimated class-size effects are systematically related to underlying
features of the school systems. Such analyses can improve our understanding of the particular
circumstances under which class sizes matter or not. Although causal class-size effects are small
at best in all the countries considered, there are still differences across countries. The
international evidence shows that the estimated effect size does not vary systematically for
children from differing family backgrounds or for countries with different levels of average
achievement, economic development, average class size, or educational spending (Woessmann
and West (2006); Woessmann (2005b)). But the existence of class-size effects is systematically
associated with the salary and education level of the teaching force. In both studies, class-size
effects were detected only in countries with relatively low teacher salaries and education. The
pattern is similar within countries in which the education level of teachers varies. In these
countries, the estimated class-size effect tends to be larger in classes that are taught by teachers
with lower education. Interpreting average teacher salary and teacher education as proxies for
average teacher quality, the results suggest that relatively capable teachers do as well when
teaching large classes as when teaching small classes. By contrast, less capable teachers do not
seem to be up to the job of teaching large classes, while doing reasonably well in small classes.
Consequently, the pattern of international effect heterogeneity suggests that class-size effects
occur only when the quality of the teaching force is relatively low.
A third approach to the identification of causal class-size effects tries to avoid bias from
non-random sorting of students by using variation within individual students. If the same student
is taught two different academic subjects in differently sized classes, the within-student betweensubject variation can be used for identification (cf. Dee (2005); Dee and West (2008)). The
inclusion of student fixed effects, implemented by differencing across subjects, effectively
excludes bias from subject-invariant student, family, and school characteristics, observable and
unobservable. Unobserved characteristics that vary by subject and are correlated with class size,
such as subject-specific fast-track or enrichment classes or teacher characteristics, could,
however, still bias this research design. Altinok and Kingdon (2009) implement this
identification strategy to estimate class-size effects in up to 45 countries using TIMSS 2003 data,
which provide test scores in math and science for each student. Their results provide little
support for class-size effects, with only few countries showing significant and sizeable positive
effects of smaller classes. Analyzing the cross-country variation in class-size effects, they
confirm that class-size effects are larger where teacher qualifications are lower, and also find
indication of larger class-size effects in developing countries.
Beyond class-size effects, Ammermueller and Dolton (2006) use the same cross-subject
identification strategy to estimate the effect of teacher-student gender interaction in England and
the United States using TIMSS and PIRLS data. In most specifications (with the exception of
one in England), they find little evidence of a significant effect of the interaction between student
and teacher gender on student achievement. Schwerdt and Wuppermann (2009) use the same
cross-subject identification with student fixed effects to identify the effects of teaching practices
on TIMSS data in the United States. At a more descriptive level, Bratti, Checchi, and Filippin
(2008) use the PISA data to estimate the association of student achievement with cooperative and
competitive attitudes towards learning at the individual and school level.
All in all, the international evidence on the role of school inputs in educational production
provides little confidence that quantitative measures of expenditure and class size are a major

23

driver of student achievement, across and within countries. Studies using different methods to
identify causal class-size effects consistently find no strong effects of class size in most
countries. The cross-country pattern suggests that class size is a relevant variable only in settings
with low teacher quality. Descriptive evidence suggests that measures of the quality of inputs
and, in particular, teachers are more closely related to student outcomes. However, research in
this area awaits more work to identify the underlying causal links.
4.4 Institutions
Motivated by the poor results on school inputs, research has increasingly focused on
whether non-resource institutional features of school systems affect student outcomes. In this
topic, the particular opportunity of cross-country research comes into play: The chief advantage
of the international comparative approach stems from its ability to exploit the substantial
variation in national education policies across countries (cf. Woessmann (2007b)). By contrast,
within-country studies are usually restricted to analysis of much more limited variation in
institutional structure. Moreover, by drawing on wider and long-established institutional
variation between countries, the international approach can capture general-equilibrium effects
of institutional settings, which will not necessarily be the case when a specific educational
reform is introduced only on a small scale, or only very recently. Such long-term generalequilibrium effects are usually the ones that economic theory stresses as being particularly
important, because persistent institutional changes will alter incentives and thus behavior. By
changing prices, available alternatives and competitive pressures for other market participants
will have effects on market outcomes beyond the people specifically treated.
Since cross-country studies can address the most obvious issues of selection into treatment
by using average measures of institutions at the systemic level, the main challenge for the
identification of causal effects lies in unobserved country heterogeneity. Institutions may be
correlated with other, unobserved country characteristics that are related to student achievement.
While still in its infancy, several methods have been developed to address this problem, tailored
to specific worries related to each specific institution. As will be discussed below, the range
includes fixed effects for world regions to eliminate the most basic cultural differences; withincountry identification where different education systems exist within one country (holding
constant differences in language, legal structures, and cultures); differences-in-differences
models that identify effects from changes between grades within each country; and the use of
historical instruments that gave rise to arguably exogenous variation in institutional structures
today.
The following review is structured around five institutional features that have attracted the
most attention in the international literature so far: accountability measures, school autonomy,
competition and private involvement, school tracking, and the pre-primary education system. It
closes with more explorative studies into education beyond the school level and less formal,
cultural features of societies. Table 8-10 provide details on the individual studies analyzing
institutional features. Table 8 reports evidence within different countries and the other two
tables report cross-country evidence. Given that different institutional features tend to be related
both to the level and to the equity of outcomes, Table 9 focuses on achievement levels, and Table
10 on the equity of achievement.

24

4.4.1 Accountability
Analyses of the impact of curriculum-based external exit exam (CBEEE) systems illustrates
the unique power of international production function estimates to address important policyrelevant issues.33 By signaling student achievement to potential employers on the labor market
and institutions of higher education, external school-leaving exams increase students’ rewards
for learning as well as parents’ scope for monitoring the education process, so that they can be
understood as an accountability devise. (See Bishop (2006) for a discussion of the underlying
theoretical concepts).
Students in countries that have external exit-exam systems very consistently perform
significantly and substantially better on the international student achievement tests than students
in countries without external exit-exam systems (see Table 9). Using country-level data, John
Bishop has shown this for the 1991 IAEP math, science, and geography tests (Bishop (1995),
section 4), the 1991 SIRS reading test (Bishop (1999)), the 1995 TIMSS math and science tests
(Bishop (1997)), and the PISA 2000 reading, math, and science tests (Bishop (2006), section 3).
Microeconometric cross-country analyses that extensively control for family-background and
school-input factors at the student level have confirmed this result for the 1995 TIMSS tests
(Woessmann (2001, 2003b)), the 1999 TIMSS-Repeat tests (Woessmann (2003a)), the 2000
PISA tests (Woessmann (2005c); Fuchs and Woessmann (2007)), and the 2003 PISA tests
(Woessmann, Luedemann, Schuetz, and West (2009); see Table 4). Taken as a whole, the
existing cross-country evidence suggests that the effect of external exit exams on student
achievement may well be larger than a whole grade-level equivalent, or between 20 and 40
percent of a standard deviation of the respective international tests.34
Beyond external exit exams, student achievement in PISA 2000 is also positively associated
with teachers’ monitoring of student progress by regular standardized tests (Fuchs and
Woessmann (2007)). Richer data on additional accountability mechanisms available in PISA
2003 (documented in Table 4) reveal positive associations of student achievement with
accountability measures aimed at teachers, such as internal and external monitoring of teacher
lessons, and with accountability measures aimed at schools, such as assessments used to compare
them to district or national achievement (Woessmann, Luedemann, Schuetz, and West (2009)).
Given the cross-sectional nature of identification, possible unobserved country heterogeneity
related to the existence of external exit exams is a concern. To exclude the possibility that
external exit exams just capture general cultural features of different world regions, Woessmann
(2003a) shows that results are robust to a regional fixed effects specification that controls for
indicators of nine world regions. To ensure that the results do not capture other features of
centralization, results also prove robust to including controls for the centralization of school
curricula and textbook approval, the share of central government financing, and ethno-linguistic
fractionalization as a proxy for the homogeneity of a country’s population.

33

We concentrate on accountability for achievement that comes through exit exams, because understanding this
topic requires analyses spanning jurisdictions with and without such institutions, making it a natural topic for use of
international assessments. Of course, many analyses of accountability systems in general have proceeded within
individual countries; see Hanushek and Raymond (2004) and Figlio and Loeb (2010).
34
Schneeweis (2010) finds that across countries, central exit exams are negatively related to the achievement gap
between migrants and natives.

25

Substantial cultural biases are also ruled out by the fact that the same positive association
between central exams and student achievement is found within countries where some regions
have external exam systems and other not. Such cross-regional studies exist for Canadian
provinces (Bishop (1997)), German states (Jürges, Schneider, and Büchel (2005); Woessmann
(2010b)), and U.S. states (Bishop, Moriarty, and Mane (2000). Woessmann (2010b) even shows
that the estimated size of the effect of external exit exams does not differ significantly between
the sample of German states and the sample of OECD countries. To probe causality further,
Jürges, Schneider, and Büchel (2005) apply a differences-in-differences approach to the German
TIMSS 1995 data that exploits the fact that in some secondary-school tracks, the states with
central exit exams have them in math but not in science, finding smaller but still substantial
effects.35
Woessmann (2005c) exploits the student-level variation within each country to analyze
whether external-exam effects are heterogeneous along several dimensions in quantile
regressions and interacted specifications. Results using the TIMSS, TIMSS-Repeat, and PISA
tests suggest that the effect tends to increase with student ability but does not differ with most
family-background measures. It increases during the course of secondary education and with
regular standardized examination. Furthermore, as discussed below, the effects of external
exams are complementary to several dimensions of school autonomy.
4.4.2 Autonomy
Another institutional feature that is sometimes argued to exert positive effects on student
outcomes is school autonomy, because local decision-makers tend to have superior information.
On the other hand, in decision-making areas where their interests are not strictly aligned with
improving student achievement, local decision-makers may act opportunistically unless they are
held accountable for the achievement of their students (see Woessmann (2005c) for a discussion
in a principal-agent framework).
The school background questionnaires of the international tests allow deriving measures of
school autonomy in several different decision-making areas. The general pattern of results (cf.
Table 9) is that students perform significantly better in schools that have autonomy in process
and personnel decisions (Woessmann (2003b); Fuchs and Woessmann (2007); Woessmann,
Luedemann, Schuetz, and West (2009)). These decisions include such areas as deciding on the
purchase of supplies and on budget allocations within schools, hiring and rewarding teachers
(within a given budget), and choosing textbooks, instructional methods, and the like. Similarly,
students perform better if their teachers have both incentives and the possibility to select
appropriate teaching methods. By contrast, school autonomy in budget formation and teacher
autonomy over the subject matter to be covered in class – two decision-making areas that are
likely subject to substantial opportunism but little superior local knowledge – are negatively
associated with student achievement.
The international evidence also points to a significant interaction of the effect of school
autonomy with the extent of accountability in the school system (as previously found in Table 4).

35

This approach assumes that there are no spillovers between achievement in math and in science. Jürges and
Schneider (2010) find positive effects of central exit exams on student achievement, but negative effects on selfreported student attitudes toward math, across German states.

26

In some areas, autonomy is negatively associated with student achievement in systems that do
not have external exit exams, but the association turns positive when combined with externalexam systems. Reflecting coefficient estimates from a student-level international education
production function using the combined TIMSS and TIMSS-Repeat data, Figure 6 depicts school
autonomy over teacher salaries as one such example. School autonomy over teacher salaries is
negatively associated with student achievement in systems without external exams. However, in
line with the arguments above, the average level of student achievement is higher in systems
with external exams. But what is more, the association between school autonomy and student
achievement turns completely around in systems with external exams: Salary autonomy of
schools is positively associated with student achievement in external-exam systems. The
estimates in Figure 6 are expressed in percentages of a standard deviation on the international
test scores, suggesting that the achievement difference between the best and worst institutional
setting amounts to three quarters of a standard deviation, a huge effect compared to other
educational interventions. Evidence from PISA 2000 corroborates this interaction pattern (Fuchs
and Woessmann (2007)). Similar positive interactions between external exams and school
autonomy have also been found for such decision-making areas as school autonomy in
determining course content and teacher influence on resource funding, among others (see
Woessmann (2005c) for details).
In light of economic theory, this pattern of results is intuitively appealing. It indicates that
local autonomy can lead to worse student outcomes if schools do not face incentives to focus
attention on these outcomes. By contrast, when external exams hold schools accountable for
student achievement, school autonomy leads to better outcomes. However, methodologically the
existing empirical evidence on school autonomy is descriptive and awaits additional work that
tries to more explicitly identify exogenous variation in school autonomy.36
4.4.3 Competition from Private Schools
A third institutional feature that has been researched using international data is the relative
performance of publicly and privately operated schools and the competition introduced by the
latter. (For a general overview of school competition, see Hoxby (2003) and Rouse and Barrow
(2009)).
A first approach is to estimate differences in student achievement between public and
private schools in each country, after controlling extensively for student and school background
information. The PISA school background questionnaire provides specific school-level
information on public versus private management and financing. Public school management is
defined as schools managed directly or indirectly by a public education authority or governing
board appointed by government or elected by public franchise, whereas private school
management is defined as schools managed directly or indirectly by a non-government
organization, for example churches, trade unions, or businesses. The share of public funding of
each school is reported as the percentage of total school funding coming from government
sources (at different levels), as opposed to such private contributions as fees and donations.

36

At the level of higher education, Aghion et al. (2007) and Aghion (2008) provide descriptive evidence that
university autonomy is associated with better outcomes in terms of research rakings.

27

Looking across all countries (Table 8), private school management tends to be positively
associated with student achievement, with a difference to publicly operated schools of 16-20
percent of an international standard deviation in the three subjects in PISA 2000 (Fuchs and
Woessmann (2007)). A similar result is found in PISA 2003 (Woessmann, Luedemann, Schuetz,
and West (2009)). The pattern is not uniform across countries, however, as revealed when
estimating the effect within countries (Woessmann (2009b)). Toma (1996) (see also Toma
(2005)) similarly estimates the effect of private school operation in five countries using the 1981
SIMS, noting that the positive effect of private provision is independent of whether the countries
tend to finance the schools publicly or not. Estimating the effect of private school operation in
eight countries in PISA 2000, Vandenberghe and Robin (2004) find positive effects only in some
countries, but they do not account for differences in the source of school funding. Using the
same database and distinguishing between privately operated schools that do and do not depend
on government funding, Corten and Dronkers (2006) find a positive association of the
achievement of students with low socio-economic status with private government-dependent
schools, but no significant differences between public and private-independent schools.
Dronkers and Robert (2008) find that the better performance of government-dependent private
schools can be accounted for by a better school climate.
Using school-level variation of public-private operation in a pooled sample of countries,
Woessmann, Luedemann, Schuetz, and West (2009) find positive interactions between private
school operation and the average extent of autonomy that schools have in a country. Privately
operated schools perform better if schools in the system are autonomous in formulating the
budget and in staffing decisions, suggesting that the incentives created by parental choice of
private schools work particularly well if (private and public) schools in the system have
autonomy to respond to the parental demands. Furthermore, they show that the association of
student achievement with two measures of external accountability – the monitoring of teacher
lessons by external inspectors and assessment-based comparisons of schools to national
performance – is stronger in privately operated schools than in publicly operated schools.
Private schools may thus benefit particularly from the accountability created by external
inspection and performance comparisons with other schools.
Given the problem of non-random selection into private versus public schools within a
country, these results based on micro-level variations within countries should be interpreted with
caution. While many features of self-selection will be held constant by the extensive familybackground controls that most of the studies contain, possible unobserved student heterogeneity
may still raise concerns of selection bias. Because issues of self-selection cancel out at the
country level, the cross-country estimation approach provides the possibility to address selection
concerns by measuring private schooling as a share at the country level. In addition, in contrast
to most within-country studies, studies that measure private-school shares at the country level are
able to capture general-equilibrium effects that may arise from private competition. If the
existence of private alternatives exerts competitive pressure on nearby public schools, both
private and public schools may perform at a higher level due to larger private shares.
Consequently, there may be important effects of private schools at the system level even if there
is no performance difference between private and public schools at the school level.
Studies that include country-level measures of private school operation (Table 9)
consistently find a strong positive association with student achievement (see Woessmann
(2003b) for TIMSS 1995; Woessmann (2009b) for PISA 2000; and Woessmann, Luedemann,

28

Schuetz, and West (2009) for PISA 2003). At the same time, the measure of private funding
shares available in PISA is negatively associated with student achievement. This pattern is
depicted in Figure 7 and Table 4, which show that students in countries that combine relatively
high shares of private operation with relatively high shares of public funding perform highest
among the different operation-funding combinations, while students in countries that combine
public operation with private funding perform lowest. On average, the difference between the
countries at the first and ninth decile on the international distribution – 60 percentage points in
terms of private operation and 45 percentage points in terms of government funding – can
account for roughly 0.35 standard deviations in educational achievement each.
The results point towards the importance of distinguishing between the operation and
funding dimensions of private involvement. Without public funding, poor families may be
constrained in their choices because they do not have the financial means to opt for private
schooling. In this case, public funding may help families to exert their choices in terms of
privately managed schools. The fact that public funding is positively associated with student
achievement may thus also point to positive performance effects of school choice and
competition. This line of reasoning is consistent with evidence in Woessmann (2009b) showing
that at the school level, the advantage of privately operated schools over publicly operated
schools is particularly strong in countries with large shares of public funding. It is also in line
with the finding of Woessmann, Luedemann, Schuetz, and West (2009), who show that students
in countries where public funding is equalized between privately and publicly operated schools
perform significantly better than students in countries where privately operated schools receive
less government funding than publicly operated schools. Thus, a level playing field between
public and private schools in terms of government funding may be an important ingredient for
the competitive effects of private schools to emerge.
Beyond choice created by private schools, Woessmann, Luedemann, Schuetz, and West
(2009) do not find significant associations on average of student achievement with proxies for
choice among public schools, such as the share of students in a country who do not attend their
school because it is the local school and who report that they attend their school because it is
better than alternatives. But within urban areas where there are schools to choose from, reduced
local attendance and increased choice of better schools are associated with better student
achievement. Using sub-national regional variation in PISA 2003, Sprietsma (2008) finds a
positive association of student achievement with the regional average of students reporting to
attend their school because it is known to be a good school, which is interpreted as a measure of
quality-based school choice.
Combining German state-level data with data for OECD countries, Woessmann (2010b)
shows that the association of private school shares with student achievement is not statistically
different between the sample of German states and the sample of OECD countries. The result
suggests that the international finding is not driven by major cultural differences between
countries.
But there are additional challenges to causal identification of the effect of private
competition. Omitted variables may be correlated with both the extent of private schooling and
student achievement, such as factors related to the demand for private schooling or institutional
or policy factors that affect its supply. Moreover, even well-controlled comparisons of countries
or regions with small and large private sectors will be biased to the extent that low-quality public
schools increase demand for private schooling as a substitute. To address these concerns, West
29

and Woessmann (forthcoming) develop an instrumental variable identification that exploits the
fact that resistance of the Catholic Church to the state schooling emerging in the 19th century has
repercussions for the size of the private school sector today. This historical source of variation
can be used as a natural experiment to identify exogenous variation in private school
competition. The instrumental-variable specification uses the share of Catholics in 1900 –
interacted with an indicator for Catholicism not being the state religion, as Catholics had no need
to opt out of the state school system if the Church could control it – as an instrument for current
private-school shares. The historical nature of the instrument allows controlling directly for any
effect that the current Catholic share has on student achievement.
Estimating richly controlled student-level international education production functions on
the PISA 2003 data, West and Woessmann (forthcoming) confirm a significant positive effect of
the share of privately operated schools on student achievement in math, science, and reading.
The fact that the current share of Catholics, a control in some of their model, is negatively related
to student achievement suggests that distinctive cultural features of traditionally Catholic
countries are unlikely to be driving the results. The validity of the identification is additionally
corroborated by the fact that Catholic shares are historically related to lower literacy and lower
GDP per capita. To account for other possible channels through which the historical prevalence
of Catholicism might be related to student outcomes today, the models also control for current
GDP per capita and educational spending per student. Additional specification tests show that
other current outcomes that might be conceived to be related to historical Catholicism, such as
the decentralization of school policy decision-making, public social spending, and income
inequality, are in fact uncorrelated with historical Catholic shares. West and Woessmann
(forthcoming) also show that much of the positive effect of private school shares accrues to
students in public schools. This suggests that the overall effect is not simply due to privately
operated schools being more effective, but rather reflects general-equilibrium effects of private
competition. Finally, private competition is also found to reduce educational expenditure per
student in the system, so that the better educational outcomes are obtained at lower cost.
As the overview in Table 10 shows, a topic that emerged only relatively recently in the
international literature is the question to which extent institutional features of the school systems
can account for differences in the equity (rather than level) of student achievement across
countries. A consistent pattern in this literature is that shares of privately operated schools and
shares of public funding are not only associated with higher levels of student achievement, but
also with a reduced dependence of student achievement on socio-economic background. This
has been shown both for the books-at-home indicator of family background in TIMSS and
TIMSS-Repeat (Schuetz, Ursprung, and Woessmann (2008)) and for an index of socio-economic
background in PISA 2003 (Woessmann, Luedemann, Schuetz, and West (2009), chapter 7).37 In
addition, Woessmann, Luedemann, Schuetz, and West (2009) find that a higher difference
between private and public schools in the share of government funding is negatively associated
not only with average student achievement, but also with equality of educational opportunity.

37

Ammermueller (2005) finds a negative association of the share of private schools with his measure of equality of
opportunity, but this may be due to the fact that the model does not control for public versus private funding of
schools.

30

4.4.4 Tracking
Another institutional feature of school systems that has been discussed mostly in terms of
the equity of student outcomes is tracking. Here, tracking is meant to refer to the placement of
students into different school types, hierarchically structured by performance. Such school
placement policies are variously called tracking, streaming, ability grouping, or selective (as
opposed to comprehensive) schooling. From a theoretical viewpoint, the effects of educational
tracking are controversial: Depending on the nature of peer effects assumed, homogeneous
classes may contribute to optimal learning situations for all students through focused curricula
and adequate progress, or weaker groups may be systematically disadvantaged if they are
separated early on.38 Countries differ widely in the age at which they first track children into
different types of schools. In the majority of OECD countries, tracking takes place at the age of
15 or 16, with no tracking until grade 9 or 10. In contrast, some countries undertake the first
tracking at the age of 10. Again, this international variation lends itself particularly well to
analyze the effects of the institutional feature of tracking (cf. Woessmann (2009a)).
Hanushek and Woessmann (2006) develop an international differences-in-differences
approach to identify the causal effect of early tracking in a cross-country setting (cf. Table 10).
The basic idea starts with the fact that in all countries, students are taught in a uniform school
type for the first four years of schooling. Therefore, a comparison of the change in educational
inequality between 4th grade and the end of lower-secondary school between countries with and
without early tracking can provide information on possible impacts of tracking. The analysis
takes out the general level of inequality and considers only the change in inequality that occurs
after 4th grade to determine the effect of early tracking. This method basically involves an
investigation of the relationship depicted in Figure 8. The figure shows the inequality in reading
achievement in 4th grade (in PIRLS) and at age 15 (in PISA 2003) for all countries that
participated in both studies, measuring educational inequality by the standard deviation in
student test scores. The essence of the analysis is to compare the change in inequality that
occurs from primary to lower-secondary school between countries with and without educational
tracking during this period. When looking at the change between the achievement dispersion in
PIRLS and PISA, that part of the inequality measured at the end of lower-secondary school that
already existed in 4th grade is eliminated. The change is indicated by the lines that connect the
two points of each country. For countries with early tracking, solid connecting lines are used,
while dashed lines indicate countries without early tracking. It is clearly visible that nearly all
black solid lines point upwards whereas nearly all red dashed lines point downwards: In
countries with early tracking, inequality increases systematically, whereas it decreases in
countries without tracking.
Hanushek and Woessmann (2006) confirm this graphic depiction in country-level
econometric estimates based on a differences-in-differences approach: The difference between
countries with and without early tracking is investigated in terms of the difference in inequality
between primary and lower-secondary school. The results show that early tracking
systematically increases the inequality of student achievement. In total, their analyses take into
account eight pairs of tests in primary and secondary schools, combining a total of 176 country
38

Here we concentrate entirely on tracking that occurs between schools, i.e., where children are sorted into separate
schools. Many countries of the world, including the U.S., pursue tracking within schools but not generally across
schools. For more on within-school tracking, see Betts (2010).

31

observations. In contrast to the results on inequality, the results on achievement levels are less
clear. But there is little evidence that early tracking increases the achievement level. To the
contrary, in the most comprehensive model there is a marginally significant negative effect of
early tracking on the average achievement level. When evaluating achievement at different
percentiles of the performance distribution, not even for the best 5 percent of students is there a
positive effect of early tracking.
While this investigation considers the dispersion of student achievement, Schuetz, Ursprung,
and Woessmann (2008) investigate the more direct measure of inequality of opportunity outlined
above: the extent to which individual student achievement depends on the family background of
the student. At a more descriptive level, the effect of early tracking on equity is identified by the
interaction of the country-level measure of early tracking with the student-level measure of
family background in a student-level model with country fixed effects. The measure of
inequality of opportunity familiar from Figure 2 above is found to be significantly smaller, the
later the tracking age of students. If tracking is postponed by four years, for example, the impact
of family background on student achievement is smaller by one quarter of the entire impact of
the family background averaged across the OECD countries. In a model without country fixed
effects, the association between early tracking and the average achievement level is statistically
insignificant and negative.
The same association between tracking and equality of opportunity is found in a related
study using PISA 2003 data (Woessmann, Luedemann, Schuetz, and West (2009), chapter 7).
Using the Index of Economic, Social, and Cultural Status (ESCS) provided by the PISA study as
an alternative measure for family background, the qualitative results are the same: The
association between test scores and family background is significantly smaller, the higher the age
of first tracking. This association is depicted in Figure 9: In countries with earlier tracking, the
achievement difference between children with different socio-economic backgrounds is
considerably larger. As the figure reveals, this effect arises primarily from the fact that children
with low socio-economic status in countries without early tracking perform considerably better.
At the same time, children from families with a relatively high socio-economic status perform at
approximately the same level. Accordingly, the effect of later tracking on the average
achievement level is again positive, albeit not statistically significant.
In terms of the equity effects, Ammermueller (2005) reports similar results for the number
of school types (rather than the age of first tracking) based on the international PIRLS and PISA
data. Waldinger (2006) uses a combination of the approach of Hanushek and Woessmann
(2006) and Schuetz, Ursprung, and Woessmann (2008) and tends to find statistically
insignificant results, but this may be largely due to limited degrees of freedom in samples of only
8-14 countries and a less informative tracking measure. Brunello and Checchi (2007) use the
international approach described here for results beyond school age, finding that tracking
increases the effect of family background on earnings in the labor market. Using a similar
approach, Schneeweis (2010) finds some indication that an index of between-school social
segregation, presumably partly caused by early tracking, is positively associated with the
achievement gap between migrants and natives across countries.
Using system-level data, Woessmann (2010b) pools German states (most of which track
after 4th grade, but some of which track after 6th grade) with OECD countries in a sample of 4254 observations. Results indicate that the negative association between early tracking and the
measure of inequality of educational opportunity (the slope of the socio-economic gradient) is
32

statistically indistinguishable between the sample of German states and the sample of OECD
countries. This shows that the cross-country association cannot be accounted for by such
country-level omitted factors as differences in culture, language, or legal background.
4.4.5 Pre-primary Education System
The fact, discussed above, that student achievement is strongly associated with family
background is suggestive of the idea that learning in the formative years before formal schooling
is important for ultimate academic achievement. Consequently, student achievement towards the
end of compulsory school is not only related to features of the school system, but also to preschool education (see the conceptual discussion in Cunha, Heckman, Lochner, and Masterov
(2006) and Blau and Currie (2006) for a general review of the empirical literature). In line with
this reasoning, Schuetz, Ursprung, and Woessmann (2008) find a positive association of student
achievement in 8th grade (in TIMSS and TIMSS-Repeat) with the usual duration of the preschool cycle in a country.
Schuetz (2009) uses the individual-level information on pre-primary attendance available in
PISA 2003 to show that pre-primary attendance is positively associated with achievement at age
15 in most countries. She goes on to exploit the fact that the size of this association varies
substantially across countries. Estimating a cross-country student-level specification with
country fixed effects and interactions between individual pre-primary attendance and countrylevel indicators of the quality of pre-primary education, she finds that the achievement gap
between students who did and did not attend pre-primary education is positively associated with
country-level measures of per-student spending in pre-primary education, of the share of preprimary institutions being privately operated, and of the training level and relative pay of preprimary teachers. Thus, indicators of institutions and structural quality of pre-primary education
systems can account for variation in the estimated coefficients on pre-primary attendance across
countries. While the study is descriptive in the sense that individual pre-primary attendance may
not be conditionally random, the estimators of interest are unbiased by selection decisions as
long as the selection process is the same in all countries. In this sense, under the assumption that
that enrollment in pre-primary education follows the same rules in all countries, interacted
specification can be interpreted as an international differences-indifferences approach.
In terms of equity, using the interacted specification described above, Schuetz, Ursprung,
and Woessmann (2008) show that the association between socio-economic background and 8thgrade student achievement is negatively related to the duration of pre-primary education in a
country. Furthermore, the thus measured equality of educational opportunity follows an inverted
U-shaped relationship with pre-school enrollment: The association between the books-at-home
measure of socio-economic background and TIMSS student achievement increases up to a preprimary enrollment rate of 60 percent in a country and decrease beyond that threshold. This
result pattern may indicate that initially, children who are otherwise advantaged attend preprimary education. Only once most of a country’s children attend pre-primary institutions does
pre-primary attendance increase equality of educational opportunity for children from lower
socio-economic backgrounds. Using a similar approach to focus on equality of educational
opportunity between native and migrant children, Schneeweis (2010) finds that the migrant
achievement gap is negatively associated with pre-primary enrollment across countries.

33

4.4.6 Additional Results
Apart from the five institutions discussed so far – accountability, autonomy, competition,
tracking, and pre-primary system – descriptive studies have also looked beyond school age and
into less formal institutional settings of societies. Cascio, Clark, and Gordon (2008) focus on the
education system beyond the school level by observing age profiles of literacy into adulthood
using the IALS adult achievement test. They show that countries with higher university
graduation rates have larger literacy gains into adulthood. Guiso, Monte, Sapienza, and Zingales
(2008) show a negative country-level association of the achievement gap between boys and girls
in PISA 2003 with several indicators of a gender-equal culture such as indices of cultural
attitudes towards women, female economic activity, and women’s political empowerment.
These suggestive findings warrant further rigorous testing.
4.5 Conclusions on the Determinants of International Educational Achievement
The economic literature on determinants of international differences in educational
achievement has applied two main approaches. The first approach exploits the cross-country
variation for identification of cross-country associations. The second approach estimates the
same association within different countries in order to enhance understanding of whether a
factor’s importance differs systematically in different settings. Part of the existing work is
descriptive in nature, estimating the association of student achievement with certain factors after
controlling for the rich set of possible inputs into educational production available in the
international background data. But quasi-experimental work has been developed to identify
some of the underlying causal mechanisms both in the cross-country and in the within-country
approach.
On family background and school inputs, the international results tend to mirror the existing
national evidence on educational production. Many dimensions of students’ family background
are important factors for their educational achievement. At the same time, it is hard to find
evidence of substantial positive effects of most resource inputs, in particular class sizes and
expenditure levels. Among school inputs, there is somewhat more indication of positive effects
of measures capturing teacher quality, such as (in an international setting) teacher education. A
particular opportunity of the international research is that it can unveil whether certain effects
differ systematically across countries, such as class-size effects or the equality of educational
achievement for students with different family or migration backgrounds. For example, the
international pattern suggests that significant class-size effects are only present in systems with
relatively low teacher quality. This result raises the cost-effectiveness question of whether
student achievement is best served by reducing class size or by increasing the low teacher quality
even in the countries where class-size effects are present.
The second particular opportunity of the international research is the substantial institutional
variation that exists across countries. The international evidence on education production
functions suggests that schools matter for student outcomes, but not so much in terms of
traditional inputs. Instead the impact of schools comes through teacher quality and institutional
structures that determine incentives. Institutional features of school systems can account for a
substantial part of the cross-country variation in student achievement. In the school system,
institutions that tend to be associated with higher achievement levels include accountability
measures like external exit exams, school autonomy in process and personnel decisions (if

34

combined with accountability), private-school competition, and public financing. Later tracking,
public funding, and private operation are systematically related to the equality of student
outcomes. While some of the evidence is descriptive, convincing causal identification has been
developed that support the results on external exit exams, private-school competition, and
tracking. Also beyond the school system, institutions of the pre-school and post-school
education systems are related to international differences in educational achievement. In
particular, more extensive pre-primary education systems relate to more equalized student
achievement for children from different family and migration backgrounds, and measures of preprimary quality tend to be related to the size of the pre-primary effect.
As more and more countries participate in the international tests, the opportunities grow for
future research on the determinants of international educational achievement. With the
additional variation, the international research will be able to draw on more experience with
different institutions and start to analyze additional specific features beyond the broad concepts
of institutional structures analyzed so for. There is also considerable scope for future research to
advance identification in quasi-experimental research settings. Furthermore, as more regular
tests with reasonable comparability over time become available, a panel structure of international
tests emerges that provides longitudinal information within countries. This will allow future
research to exploit educational reforms in different countries over time. A limiting factor
remains the lack of individual-level panel data in the international tests.

5. Economic Consequences of International Educational Achievement
Turning to the economic consequences of educational achievement, the international
achievement data permit several types of studies that are impossible when relying on skill
information for a single country. First, at the individual level it is possible to investigate whether
the translation of skills into earnings differs across a range of countries. While there are many
studies of schooling and earnings within individual countries, it is impossible to make reliable
comparisons across countries without common skill measures for the different countries. And
without such comparisons, it is not possible to understand how economic institutions and market
forces affect the returns to skills. Second, it is impossible to understand fully how these same
forces enter into the determination of earnings distributions of countries. While it is possible to
trace the evolution of the income and earnings distributions over time within a country, it is very
difficult to understand how differences in the structure of the country’s economy enter into the
observed distributional outcomes. Finally, effects of labor-force skills on aggregate economic
outcomes essentially demand cross-country data so that outcomes can be related to varying
structures. Work on each of these areas is evaluated in the subsequent sections.
5.1 Cognitive Skills and Individual Labor-Market Outcomes
Evaluating the impact of cognitive skills on individual earnings has always been difficult
because of data availability issues. Most work in earnings determination has relied just on
school attainment – in large part because individual earnings and school attainment are
frequently collected together in population censuses. Thus, for example, the world survey of
Psacharopoulos and Patrinos (2004) provides estimates of basic Mincer earnings functions for 98

35

separate countries.39 But it is much less common to measure both cognitive skills and labormarket outcomes within the same survey.40 Cognitive skills are typically measured for students
in school, and thus generally before any labor-market outcomes can be observed. The most
common joint measurement of skills and wages comes from panel data that covers both
schooling periods and subsequent labor-market experiences, and these are invariably available
for just individual countries.41
One innovation in international surveys is to sample adults of different ages instead of using
a school-based or cohort-based design. The first international survey of this type was the
International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS), a set of surveys and tests given to 20 countries
between 1994 and 1998. This focus was very different than the school-based international tests
because it considered a labor force centered survey that covered adults (age 16-65). The tests
employed were also unique, covering several functional areas including: Prose Literacy – the
knowledge and skills needed to understand and use information from texts including editorials,
news stories, poems, and fiction; Document Literacy – the knowledge and skills required to
locate and use information contained in various formats, including job applications, payroll
forms, transportation schedules, maps, tables, and graphics; and Quantitative Literacy – the
knowledge and skills required to apply arithmetic operations, either alone or sequentially, to
numbers embedded in printed materials, such as balancing a checkbook, calculating a tip,
completing an order form, or determining the amount of interest on a loan from an
advertisement. They were designed to be very practical.42
All of the existing comparative analyses rely on data from the IALS survey (Table 11).43 By
linking labor-market outcomes to comparably measured cognitive skills, direct international
comparisons and analyses are possible.44
39

The model of earnings determination by Mincer (1970, 1974) relates the logarithm of earnings to years of
schooling, potential experience, potential experience squared, and possibly other control variables; see equation (4)
below. The coefficient on school attainment is frequently interpreted as the rate of return to a year of schooling,
although this interpretation is challenged by Heckman, Lochner, and Todd (2006, 2008). In our analysis below, we
do not interpret the common estimates as a rate of return but instead simply think of them as the earnings gradient
that is associated with schooling or higher cognitive skills.
40
We focus exclusively on cognitive skills, although others have pointed to the role of non-cognitive skills. Noncognitive skills, while seldom precisely defined, include a variety of interpersonal dimensions including
communications ability, team work skills, acceptance of social norms, and the like. Along such a line, Samuel
Bowles and Herbert Gintis and more recently James Heckman and his co-authors have argued that non-cognitive
skills are very important for earnings differences. The early work along these lines includes Bowles and Gintis
(1976) and Bowles, Gintis, and Osborne (2001). This is extended in a variety of ways in Cunha, Heckman, Lochner,
and Masterov (2006) and Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua (2006). Nonetheless, no consistent international data have
been available on non-cognitive skills.
41
Because of our focus on international comparative analyses, we do not review the work related to individual
countries. For a review of the role of cognitive skills on earnings determination within individual countries, see
Hanushek and Woessmann (2008).
42
The tests on the IALS surveys are identified as being very practical, but they have been shown to be closely
related to the PISA scores for individuals. For individual performance on the prose literacy scale, the correlation
with PISA is 0.85 (Yamamoto (2002)).
43
The follow-on Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey (ALLS), conducted in 2002-06, has not been used, in part
because only five countries participated. A second follow-up by the OECD, the Programme for the International
Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), promises an expansion of participating countries when it is initially
administered in 2011.

36

The clearest example of the possibilities can be found in Leuven, Oosterbeek, and Ophem
(2004). They consider a simple question of whether underlying supply and demand for skills
could explain the pattern of observed wage differentials in countries. This work was partly
motivated by an earlier study by Blau and Kahn (1996), which suggested that returns to school
attainment across countries did not reflect supply and demand conditions. Leuven, Oosterbeek,
and Ophem (2004) use the skill measures from the IALS survey for 14 countries. By comparing
the relative demand for skill categories across industries in each country to the aggregate supply
of these skill groups, they find that wage patterns are indeed consistent with a simple supplydemand model, at least for lower and intermediate skill categories. This analysis highlights the
necessity of having cross-country information to address questions about overall economic
structures.
The typical international study of individual earnings emulates wage determination models
employed in studies of individual economies, although here the interpretation becomes more
difficult because of concerns about quality differentials. By far the most common model of
individual earnings is the “Mincer earnings model”, which can be thought of as a specialized
form of equation (1). In this, the standard estimation model takes the form:
(4)

y = b0 + b1S + b2 Exp + b3 Exp 2 + b4W + υ

where Exp is labor-market experience, W is a vector of other measured factors affecting incomes,
and y is labor-market earnings, typically measured in logarithms. One can think of this as
estimating equation (1) where S is simply substituted as the measure of human capital (H). But,
according to equation (2), the estimated return to a year of schooling (b1) is biased through the
correlation of S with F, A, and any omitted elements of Z; examples of such correlation would be
predicted in standard optimizing models of the choice of years of schooling (e.g., Card (1999);
Glewwe (2002)). Recognizing this, significant attention has concentrated on ability bias arising
from the correlation of school attainment with A and from other selection effects having to do
with families and ability (see Card (1999)).
One set of typical estimates of earnings models adds test-score measures to the Mincer
model in equation (4) explicitly to control for ability differences. The international versions of
these can be found in Denny, Harmon, and Redmond (2000) and Denny, Harmon, and
O’Sullivan (2004). Their focus is largely on how inclusion of IALS test scores in equation (4)
alters the estimates of b1.
The second issue beyond general concerns about omitted variables bias in equation (4) is
that most formulations of Mincer models assume that school quality is either constant or can be
captured by addition of direct measures of school quality such as school resources in equation
(4). One extended version is to assume that cognitive skills is a measure of school quality –
leading to estimating models that either add cognitive skills to equation (4) or interact cognitive
skills with school attainment.
But both approaches neglect the importance of non-school influences on cognitive skills,
particularly from the family. These factors have been well documented within the literature on
44

Other researchers have used single-country samples from IALS to investigate labor-market issues, but we do not
include them in our evaluation of the cross-country uses of the data. See, for example, Oosterbeek (1998), McIntosh
and Vignoles (2001), and Edin and Gustavsson (2008).

37

education production functions, and recognition of them provides the backdrop for the
formulation in equation (2).45 If the vector of other factors, W, in the earnings model includes
the relevant other influences on human capital from equation (2), the estimate of b1 would be
simply φγ (as long as school quality is constant).46 Unfortunately, rich information about other
determinants of skills outside of school attainment is seldom available, because this requires data
about factors contemporaneous with schooling and long before observed labor-market data are
available. While a number of ingenious approaches have been used, including for example
exploiting the common experiences of twins, it is seldom plausible to conclude that the other
factors in equation (2) have been adequately controlled, leading to the interpretation of b1 as the
combined influence of school and correlated but omitted other influences.47 As such, b1 is a
reduced-form coefficient that will give biased estimates of the potential impact from a policy
designed to change school attainment alone.
An alternative conceptual approach is simply to take the measure of cognitive skills as a
direct measure of human capital. While this appears similar in some ways to the classic
estimation of Mincer equations except that cognitive skills (C) are employed instead of school
attainment (S), it has some potential advantages, because it implicitly subsumes the various
(unmeasured) determinants of human capital in equation (2).
This suggests the following modification of equation (4), which is a reduced-form equation
that combines influences of cognitive factors through the channels of C and S:
(5)

y = b0' + b1' S + b2' Exp + b3' Exp 2 + b4' W + b5' C + υ '

In this formulation, estimation of equation (5) with the inclusion of C yields an implication
that the coefficient on S (i.e., b1' ) would reflect the impact of human capital differences that are
not captured by C.48 Yet, for the same reasons discussed previously, b1' would not be simply φγ .
It is still biased by other omitted determinants of C, such as the family, described in equation (2).
It is important to note, nonetheless, that finding a direct effect of schooling on earnings to be
zero ( b1' = 0 ) after conditioning on cognitive skills is not the same as saying that school
attainment does not matter. It merely says that the impact of school comes entirely through the
45

See, for example, the discussion in Hanushek (1979).
While equation (2) highlights measurement error and its sources, the historical treatment has concentrated almost
exclusively on simple misreporting of years of schooling, as opposed to potential omitted variables bias from
neglecting (correlated) components of the true skill differences contained in H. See, for example, Ashenfelter and
Krueger (1994). In our context, simple survey errors in S are a relatively small part of the measurement errors and
omissions in specifying human capital.
47
In terms of equation (2), studies using schooling and income differences of twins (see Card (1999)) assume that
school quality differences are relatively unimportant or unsystematic so that quantity of schooling, S, is the central
object. Then, if ability, family circumstances, and other factors affecting skills are relatively constant across twins,
differences in schooling can be related to differences in earnings to obtain an unbiased estimate of γ. Of course, the
key question remaining is why S differs across otherwise identical twins who presumably face identical investment
payoffs. Other instrumental variable approaches have also been introduced to deal with the endogeneity of
schooling, but they frequently will suffer if human capital evolves from non-school factors as in equation (2).
48
Heckman and Vytlacil (2001) go further to argue that it is not possible to separate school attainment and
achievement because they are so highly correlated. The importance of this depends, however, on the specific data
samples and questions being investigated.
46

38

impact on cognitive skills, so that schooling that does not raise cognitive skills is not productive.
In general, the impact of school attainment is:
(6)

∂y / ∂S = b1' + b5' (∂C / ∂S )

What does this mean in an international context? First, as discussed previously, it does not
make much sense to combine the estimates of earnings models across countries, because it is
inappropriate to assume that the rate of learning during a year of school is the same across
countries. It also implies that it is difficult to compare international returns to school attainment,
since the estimated returns are dependent on country-specific elements including school quality,
the importance of other determinants of skills, and the rewards for differing levels of schooling.
The pattern of returns to cognitive skills across countries can be seen from estimating
equation (5) for the sample of countries in the IALS survey. Hanushek and Zhang (2009)
provide estimates of b5' for 13 separate countries, which exhibit wide variation, as shown in
Figure 10. Each standard deviation of test performance is associated with almost 20 percent
higher annual earnings in the U.S. but less than 5 percent in Sweden and is actually
insignificantly different from zero in Poland. (Note, however, that the Polish survey was
conducted in 1994, and its economy had yet to adjust completely from the fall of communism).
The IALS survey permits direct investigation of the importance of omitted factors from
equation (2) when estimating Mincer models. Obtaining unbiased estimates of the return to
school attainment within different countries has consumed considerable attention, but little work
has actually combined the determinants of achievement with the estimation of equation (4).
Figure 11 illustrates the impact on estimated schooling parameters from including information
about an individual’s family background and cohort-specific measures of health and ability.49
From this figure, it is apparent that the average returns to attainment fall significantly (from
0.071 to 0.044) while the variation across countries is also lessened considerably. These
adjustments are also more significant than is typical in the literature concerned with the
estimation of returns to schooling (Card (1999)).
The study of substantive economic policy issues is also aided by having international data
for individuals with comparable skills. In work consistent with the discussion here, Kahn (2004)
takes cognitive skills measured by IALS test scores as a consistent measure of human capital and
focuses directly on inter-country differences in immigrants. His comparison of the labor-market
employment rates of immigrants in four different developed countries shows variations in labormarket assimilation (that largely remain unexplained). In a second international study, Kahn
(2007) defines skill categories of workers by the IALS cognitive-skills tests in order to look at
the distributional impacts of varying employment protection laws across countries – a subject
that cannot be easily researched within countries because of the uniformity of the laws within a
country. He finds that low-skill workers are pushed from permanent jobs to temporary jobs by
more stringent employment protection laws.50
49

One element of the analysis in Hanushek and Zhang (2009) is the adjustment of school attainment for variations in
school quality over time (for each country separately). They find that many countries have had significant changes
in quality (generally improvements in quality) over time, but the U.S. is an exception to this.
50
Similar impacts are also seen for youth and for immigrants in the seven countries analyzed (Canada, Finland,
Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States).

39

Finally, while it is too early to see the full range of possibilities, some individual countries
have followed earlier PISA test takers or have merged data from PISA with other existing data
such as that from country registers. These studies, because they build on either the PISA-2000 or
the PISA-2003 data and have relatively short transitions since age 15 when the students were
tested, have looked largely at school transitions and movements into first jobs.51 A common
finding of these studies is that performance on the international tests is predictive of entry into
higher education. Nevertheless, since these have been the uncoordinated work of individual
countries, there is neither consistent data outside of PISA nor any commitments to continue these
datasets into the future. Thus, these uses appear to be idiosyncratic to individual countries and
do not easily support cross-country analyses.
5.2 Cognitive Skills and the Distribution of Economic Outcomes

One implication of the impact of cognitive skills on individual earnings is that the
distribution of those skills in the economy will have a direct effect on the distribution of income.
Cognitive skills by themselves do not of course determine the full distribution, because other
factors such as labor-market institutions, taxes, and the like enter. But the importance of skills is
becoming increasingly evident.
Very suggestive evidence on the impact of skills on the income distribution comes from
Nickell (2004). Nickell, using the IALS data, considers how differences in the distribution of
incomes across countries are affected by the distribution of skills and by institutional factors
including unionization and minimum wages. While union coverage is statistically significant, he
concludes that “the bulk of the variation in earnings dispersion is generated by skill dispersion”
(page C11).52
The impact of the skill distribution across countries is shown dramatically in Figure 12
which is derived from a simple comparison of the dispersion of wages and the dispersion of
prose literacy scores (each measured as the ratio of the 90th to the 10th percentile). The tight
pattern around the regression line reflects a simple correlation of 0.85 (which is not affected by
including the other institutional factors).
There are of course many reasons to be concerned about this aggregate descriptive
comparison, and other authors have pursued more systematic analysis of the variation in earnings
using the micro data. Table 12 lists three existing studies that contrast the distribution of
earnings in the U.S. with that in one or more other countries and that employ IALS data to define
the underlying distribution of skills. Blau and Kahn (2005) provide the most comprehensive
study where the U.S. is compared to nine other countries, and earnings are decomposed
following the general approach of Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1993). They reach two general

51

See, for example, studies in Canada (Knighton and Bussière (2006); Bushnik, Barr-Telford, and Bussière (2004)),
Denmark (Jensen and Andersen (2006); Humlum, Kleinjans, and Nielsen (2010)), and Switzerland (Bertschy,
Cattaneo, and Wolter (2009)). Follow-up data collection is also being developed in Australia and in the Czech
Republic, although analyses using these data are currently unavailable. See also the summary of databases and
analyses in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2007), p. 300.
52
De Gregorio and Lee (2002) find a (somewhat weaker) positive association between inequality in years of
schooling and income inequality.

40

conclusions that provide a useful link to the previous analyses of earnings determination.53 First,
variations in cognitive skills are indeed a component of the observed earnings distribution,
explaining 3-13 percent of variations in earnings depending on gender and the specific
distributional measure, but they are not the dominant determinant. Second, differences in prices,
i.e., the rewards to differences in skills, explain a considerably larger part of the observed
variation: 28-55 percent.
The results of the decomposition into skills and prices by Blau and Kahn (2005) are
consistent with the relatively small explanatory power of skills in the more restricted analyses of
Freeman and Schettkat (2001) and Devroye and Freeman (2001) and lead to questions about how
to interpret Figure 12. The argument of Nickell (2004) is that skill distributions and not labormarket institutions are the dominant determinant of earnings variations, but this conflicts with
the analyses of micro data from the same survey.
The reconciliation of Figure 12 with the micro analyses is straightforward at one level. The
results from the previous section described differences in returns to cognitive skills and school
attainment (Figures 10 and 11). These prior results show vividly that the prices of skills vary
widely across countries. Moreover, there is a strong positive association of the estimated returns
for cognitive skills in Figure 10 and the magnitude of test-score inequalities in Figure 12. Thus,
the skill differences and the price differences reinforce each other to yield that almost linear
relationship of skill variations and earnings variations in Figure 12.
The deeper question revolves around what aspects of labor markets lead to these price
differences, which in turn appear so important in explaining earnings distributions. The analysis
of Leuven, Oosterbeek, and Ophem (2004) focused on how the relative supplies and demands for
skills were key, while Blau and Kahn (2005) suggest that other institutional features of the labor
markets may be as important if not more important.54 Moreover, the variations in skills
themselves may feed back into the character of the labor market and the observed skill prices.
These analyses underscore the value of expanding the international component of various
investigations of labor markets. The role of supply and demand conditions, of market
institutions, and of governmental policy in determining skill prices and distributional issues
remains a rather open and fertile ground for further investigation – and it has obvious
ramifications for a variety of actively discussed governmental policies.
5.3 Cognitive Skills and Macroeconomic Growth

Macroeconomists have long been interested in the factors that contribute to the growth of
nations. Economists have considered the process of economic growth for much of the last 100

53

A third conclusion of Blau and Kahn (2005) is the suggestion that a significant effect of school attainment (while
also conditioning on cognitive skills) in their statistical analysis introduces some question about the use of cognitive
skills as the only index of human capital as done by Leuven, Oosterbeek, and Ophem (2004).
54
Note that Nickell (2004) attempted to address the issue of other institutional features with simple cross-country
regressions that added unionization and minimum-wage restrictions and concluded that it was just the skill
distribution that was important. In the formulation of Leuven, Oosterbeek, and Ophem (2004) or of Blau and Kahn
(2005), however, the linear model would be inappropriate since the returns to skills are themselves a function of
features of the labor market, including possibly the employment restrictions.

41

years, but most studies remained as theory with little empirical work.55 Over the past two
decades, economists linked analysis much more closely to empirical observations and in the
process rediscovered the importance of growth.
Human capital has been a central focus of much of the recent growth modeling, and it is a
standard element of any empirical work. The empirical macroeconomic literature focusing on
cross-country differences in economic growth has overwhelmingly employed measures related to
school attainment, or years of schooling, to test the predictions of growth models.56 Initial
analyses employed school enrollment ratios (e.g., Barro (1991); Mankiw, Romer, and Weil
(1992); Levine and Renelt (1992)) as proxies for the human capital of an economy. An
important extension by Barro and Lee (1993, 2001) was the development of internationally
comparable data on average years of schooling for a large sample of countries and years, based
on a combination of census and survey data.
The vast literature of cross-country growth regressions has tended to find a significant
positive association between quantitative measures of schooling and economic growth.57 But,
average years of schooling are a particularly incomplete and potentially misleading measure of
education for comparing the impacts of human capital on the economies of different countries. It
implicitly assumes that a year of schooling delivers the same increase in knowledge and skills
regardless of the education system. For example, a year of schooling in Peru is assumed to
create the same increase in productive human capital as a year of schooling in Japan.
Additionally, this measure assumes that formal schooling is the primary (sole) source of
education and, again, that variations in non-school factors – such as included in equation (2) –
have a negligible effect on education outcomes and human capital. This neglect of cross-country
differences in the quality of education and in the strength of family, health, and other influences
is probably the major drawback to employing such attainment measures of schooling. It also
highlights the potential role for using the international data on cognitive skills described in
section 3 above.
The empirical inconsistencies arising from explaining growth with school attainment are
well-described in Pritchett (2004, 2006). In simplest terms, positive trends in schooling
attainment around the world and especially in developing countries have not been matched by
changes in growth rates, suggesting problems with either the underlying conceptual model or
with the measurement of human capital.

5.3.1 Aggregate Measures of Cognitive Skills
A clear way to deal with the human capital measurement issues is to introduce information
from the international achievement tests, paralleling the use of the cognitive-skills measures in
the IALS surveys in analyzing patterns of earnings determination. There are two issues that are
55

For an account of the historical development, see Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2004). The associated empirical work
concentrated on within-country analyses such as Solow (1957), Jorgenson and Griliches (1967), or Denison (1985).
A concise review of alternative models and the associated empirical testing can be found in Hanushek and
Woessmann (2008).
56
The earliest studies used adult literacy rates (e.g., Azariadis and Drazen (1990); Romer (1990)) but these data
cover a limited number of countries and are error prone.
57
For extensive reviews of the literature, see, e.g., Topel (1999), Temple (2001), Krueger and Lindahl (2001),
Sianesi and Van Reenen (2003), and Pritchett (2006).

important in developing suitable data for macroeconomic analyses. First, each of the testing
situations is a separate activity with no general attempt to provide common scaling. Second, the
relevant feature for considering growth is clearly the skills of the labor force of a nation, but the
international tests described previously provide data on the current school population.
The aggregation of prior test information to create a composite for each country involves
empirical calibration.58 To understand the basic approach, we sketch the approach in Hanushek
and Woessmann (2009a) that was used to produce the score aggregates in the final column of
Table 3 and that enters into several of the recent cross-country analyses.59
As shown in Table 1, there are data from international student achievement tests on twelve
major international testing occasions before 2005. The individual testing situations contain
separate tests in different subjects and at different age groups. These testing occasions yield 36
separate test-subject-age observations, each providing internationally comparable performance
data for between 11 and 45 participating countries. Most of the tests were conducted by the IEA,
with the exception of the OECD-conducted PISA tests. Hanushek and Woessmann (2009a)
describe in detail a methodology for making the separate testing data comparable, which we
sketch here.
The methodology involves adjusting both the level of test performance and the variation of
test performance through two data transformations. Because the United States has both
participated in all of the international tests and has maintained its own longitudinal testing (the
National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP), the U.S. international performance
over time can be calibrated to this external standard – thus benchmarking each of the separate
international tests to a comparable level. This provides a relative comparison of countries taking
each test over time, but it is also necessary to establish the variance on the tests so that direct
compatibility of countries taking different tests can be established. The calibration of the
dispersion of the tests relies on holding the score variance constant within a group of countries
with stable education systems (defined in terms of secondary school attendance rates) over time.
For this, Hanushek and Woessmann (2009a) use the thirteen OECD countries who had half or
more students completing upper secondary education around the beginning of international
testing in the 1970s as the “stable” country group, and standardize variances to their group
performance on the 2000 PISA tests.
These two normalizations of the separate test data provide the basis for comparing and
aggregating the available test data. The simple average of the transformed mathematics and
science scores over all the available international tests in which a country participated provides
the most straightforward combination of the data. The test instruments yield a total of 77
countries, indicated in the final column of Table 3, that have ever participated in any of the

58

Empirical scaling as described here relies upon information about the overall distribution of scores on each test to
compare national responses. This contrasts with the psychometric approach to scaling that calls for calibrating tests
through use of common elements on each test. More recent testing, such as the PISA tests by the OECD, are
constructed so that they can be consistent over time through using common questions to link tests in different years.
A few of the available studies use data from a single testing occasion and thus do not have to aggregate scores; see
Lee and Lee (1995), Coulombe, Tremblay, and Marchand (2004), and Coulombe and Tremblay (2006).
59
This construction builds on earlier attempts to develop consistent aggregates as found in Hanushek and Kimko
(2000) and Barro (2001). Altinok and Murseli (2007) present a different approach but the details are unclear.

43

twelve international student achievement tests in mathematics and science through 2003.60 We
scale scores to a mean of 500 with a student-level standard deviation of 100 among the OECD
countries (the same scale currently used by PISA).
This procedure of averaging performance over a forty year period is meant to provide a
consistently measured proxy for the educational performance of the whole labor force, because
the basic objective is not to measure the skills of students but to obtain an index of the skills of
the workers in a country. If the quality of schools and skills of graduates are roughly constant
over time, this averaging is appropriate and uses the available information to obtain the most
reliable estimate of skills. If on the other hand there is changing performance, this averaging will
introduce measurement error of varying degrees over the sample of economic data. (The analysis
in Hanushek and Woessmann (2009a) shows some variation over time, but its importance will
clearly depend on the analytical approach and questions – a subject discussed below).
The precise scaling on the transformed metric is of course subject to considerable noise, in
particular for the early tests and for countries performing far below the international mean. The
tests are usually not developed to provide reliable estimates of performance in the tails of the
achievement distribution, which would be relevant for very poorly performing countries.
However, the rough pattern across countries of overall performance should not be severely
affected by the re-scaling.

5.3.2 Evidence on the Role of Cognitive Skills in Economic Growth
Empirical analyses building on aggregate measures of cognitive skills have reached
dramatically different conclusions than most of the prior growth analysis built on school
attainment measures of human capital. Table 13 displays the range of studies that have
considered the impacts of cognitive skills. On the whole, these contributions to empirical growth
research demonstrate that better measures of human capital alter the assessment of the role of
education and knowledge in the process of economic development dramatically.
Using the data from the international student achievement tests through 1991 to build a
measure of labor force quality, Hanushek and Kimko (2000) – first released as Hanushek and
Kim (1995) – find a statistically and economically significant positive effect of the cognitive
skills on economic growth in 1960-1990 that dwarfs the association between quantity of
schooling and growth.61 Thus, even more than in the case of education and individual earnings,
60

The latest rounds of PISA results, conducted in 2006 and released in December 2007 and in 2009 for release in
December 2010, are not contained in our aggregations which were developed to analyze growth over the 1960-2000
period. There are five countries participating in PISA 2006 that had never participated on a previous international
test. Likewise, the 2006 round of the PIRLS primary-school reading test includes three additional participants
without prior international achievement data.
61
Their estimates employ a statistical model that relates annual growth rates of real GDP per capita to the measure
of cognitive skills, years of schooling, the initial level of income, and a wide variety of other control variables
(including in different specifications the population growth rates, political measures, openness of the economies, and
the like). Hanushek and Kimko (2000) find that adding the international achievement test measures to a base
specification including only initial income and educational quantity boosts the variance in GDP per capita among
the 31 countries in their sample that can be explained by the model from 33 to 73 percent. The effect of years of
schooling is greatly reduced by including cognitive skills, leaving it mostly insignificant in alternative
specifications. At the same time, adding the other factors leaves the effects of cognitive skills basically unchanged.
Their basic formulation is also applied in much of the work described below.

44

ignoring differences in cognitive skills very significantly misses the true importance of education
for economic growth. Their estimates suggest that one country-level standard deviation higher
test performance would yield around one percentage point higher annual growth rates. (The
country-level standard deviation is roughly equivalent to half of the individual-level standard
deviation on the PISA scale).
Table 13 provides short descriptions of the array of currently available models of cognitive
skills and economic growth. This area is rapidly expanding, but it is valuable to assess where it
currently stands.
The most current picture in Hanushek and Woessmann (2008, 2009a) expands the
international student achievement tests from 31 countries in Hanushek and Kimko (2000) to 50
countries and uses more recent data on economic growth that extends the modeling to the longer
time period (1960-2000).62 The basic result is reported in column (2) of Table 14 and depicted
graphically in Figure 13. After controlling for the initial level of GDP per capita and for years of
schooling, the test-score measure of math and science skills features a statistically significant
effect on the growth in real GDP per capita for 1960-2000.63 According to this specification, test
scores that are larger by one standard deviation (measured at the student level across all OECD
countries in PISA) are associated with an average annual growth rate in GDP per capita that is
two percentage points higher over the whole 40-year period. This quantitative result is virtually
identical to that in Hanushek and Kimko (2000).
When cognitive skills are added to a model that just includes initial income and years of
schooling (column (1) of Table 14), the share of variation in economic growth explained by the
model (the adjusted R2) jumps from 0.25 to 0.73. As shown in the top of Figure 14, quantity of
schooling is statistically significantly related to economic growth in a specification that does not
include the measure of cognitive skills, but the association between years of schooling and
growth turns insignificant and its marginal effect is reduced to close to zero once cognitive skills
are included in the model (see the bottom of Figure 14). In other words, school attainment has
no independent effect over and above its impact on cognitive skills. The result remains the same
when the measure of years of schooling refers to the average between 1960 and 2000, rather than
the initial 1960 value (column (3) of Table 14). In the different specifications, there is evidence
for conditional convergence in the sense that countries with higher initial income tend to grow
more slowly over the subsequent period.
Several intervening studies have since found very similar results (see Table 13). Another
early contribution, by Lee and Lee (1995), found an effect size similar to Hanushek and Kimko
62

While more countries have test data, fifty are included in the analyses of economic growth. Twenty-five countries
are not included in the growth database due to lack of data on economic output or because they drop out of the
sample for a standard exclusion criterion in growth analyses (fifteen former communist countries, three countries for
which oil production is the dominant industry, two small countries, three newly created countries, and two further
countries lacking early output data). Two further countries (Nigeria and Botswana) turn out to be strong outliers in
the growth regressions and are therefore dropped from the sample (see Hanushek and Woessmann (2009a)). The
source of the income data is version 6.1 of the Penn World Tables (cf. Heston, Summers, and Aten (2002)), and the
data on years of schooling is an extended version of the Cohen and Soto (2007) data which is developed from Barro
and Lee (1993, 2001).
63
Another recent set of international tests has focused on reading. While the reliability of these measures is an
issue, consideration of them in addition to or instead of the math and science tests does not change the basic results
(see Hanushek and Woessmann (2009a)).

45

(2000) using data from the 1970-71 First International Science Study on the participating 17
countries, also leaving quantitative measures of education with no significant effect on growth.
Using a more encompassing set of international tests, Barro (2001) also finds that, while both the
quantity of schooling and test scores matter for economic growth, measured cognitive skills are
much more important. Employing the measure of cognitive skills developed by Hanushek and
Kimko (2000) in a development accounting framework, Woessmann (2002, 2003c) finds that the
share of cross-country variation in levels of economic development attributable to international
differences in human capital rises dramatically when cognitive skills are taken into account.
Building on Gundlach, Rudman, and Woessmann (2002), this work analyzes output per worker
in 132 countries in 1990. The variation that can be attributed to international differences in
human capital rises from 21 percent to 45 percent once the international achievement measures
are taken into account, and to over 60 percent in samples with reasonable data quality.
Extensions of the measure of Hanushek and Kimko (2000) and its imputation in Woessmann
(2003c) are also used in the cross-country growth regressions by Bosworth and Collins (2003)
and in the cross-country industry-level analysis by Ciccone and Papaioannou (2009). Both also
find that measured cognitive skills strongly dominate any effect of schooling quantity on
growth.64 Coulombe and Tremblay (2006) use test-score data from the International Adult
Literacy Survey (see Section 5.1 above) in a panel of 14 OECD countries, confirming the result
that the test-score measure outperforms quantitative measures of education.65 Jamison, Jamison,
and Hanushek (2007) extend the Hanushek and Kimko (2000) analysis by using the mathematics
component of the transformed and extended tests in Hanushek and Woessmann (2009a),
replicating and strengthening the previous results by using test data from a larger number of
countries, controlling for a larger number of potentially confounding variables, and extending the
time period of the analysis. Using the panel structure of their growth data, they suggest that
cognitive skills seem to improve income levels mainly though speeding up technological
progress, rather than shifting the level of the production function or increasing the impact of an
additional year of schooling.66
The collection of existing studies strongly suggests that cognitive skills are closely related to
the long-run growth rates for countries. While there is some variation, the existing studies also
indicate a consistency in the quantitative magnitude of effects. Simulation exercises show that
this magnitude means that relatively small improvements in the skills of a nation’s labor force
can have very large effects on long-run economic well-being (Hanushek and Woessmann
(2010a)).

64

Note that Bosworth and Collins (2003) cannot distinguish the effect of cognitive skills from the effect of quality
of government institutions. The analysis in Hanushek and Woessmann (2008) shows, however, that they can be
separated when we use our new measure of cognitive skills that also extends the country sample by several
additional data points on international test scores.
65
Additional details of this study can be found in Coulombe, Tremblay, and Marchand (2004).
66
A novel element of the work by Jamison, Jamison, and Hanushek (2007) is investigation of the impact of
cognitive skills on changes in health outcomes across countries, which can be taken as another indicator of the
welfare on nations. They find that cognitive skills have a strong impact on the decline of infant mortality rates.

46

5.3.3 Causation in a Cross-Country Framework
Work on cross-country growth analysis has been plagued by legitimate questions about
whether any truly causal effects have been identified, or alternatively whether the estimated
statistical analyses simply pick up a correlation without causal meaning. Perhaps the easiest way
to see the problems is early discussion of how sensitive estimated growth relationships were to
the precise factors that were included in the statistical work and to the country samples and time
periods of the analyses (Levine and Renelt (1992); Levine and Zervos (1993)). The sensitivity of
the estimated models provided prima facie evidence that various factors were omitted from many
of the analyses.
Whether or not the impact of cognitive skills is a causal relationship is indeed a very
important issue from a policy standpoint. It is essential to know that, if a country managed to
improve its achievement in some manner, it would see a commensurate improvement in its longrun growth rate. Said differently, if the estimates simply reflect other factors that are correlated
with test scores, a change in test scores may have little or no impact on the economy (unless the
other factors also changed). Indeed, analysis of prior estimates of school attainment have been
identified as possibly reflecting reverse causality; i.e., improved growth leads to more schooling
rather than the reverse (Bils and Klenow (2000)).
It is difficult to develop conclusive tests of causality issues within the limited sample of
countries included in the analysis. Nonetheless, Hanushek and Woessmann (2009a) provide
initial analyses of the issue of causality between cognitive skills and growth. That study pursues
a number of different approaches to ruling out major factors that could confound the results and
that could lead to incorrect conclusions about the potential impact. While none of the
approaches addresses all of the important issues and while each approach fails to be conclusive
for easily recognized reasons, the combination of approaches eliminates a number of common
concerns about the identification of a causal relationship.
First, in an extensive investigation of alternative model specifications, different measures of
cognitive skills, various groupings of countries, and specific sub-periods of economic growth,
the consistency of the alternative estimates – both in terms of quantitative impacts and statistical
significance – indicate a robustness of estimates that is uncommon to most cross-country growth
modeling. These specifications consider the timing of tests and growth in detail.67 To tackle the
most obvious reverse-causality issues, one specification separates the timing of the analysis by
estimating the effect of scores on tests conducted until the early 1980s on economic growth in
1980-2000. In this analysis, available for a smaller sample of countries only, test scores pre-date
the growth period. Results are even stronger than using the measure based on all tests.68 In
addition, reverse causality from growth to test scores is also unlikely because of the results of
education production functions, discussed above, that indicate additional resource in the school
67

For example, Ramirez, Luo, Schofer, and Meyer (2006) suggest that if one looks at the recent period (1980-2000)
and also drops the East Asian countries, math and science is no longer significant. However, Hanushek and
Woessmann (2009a) show that the coefficient on test scores is virtually the same in their basic results as when the
sample is restricted to 1980-2000 and dropping East Asian countries. Their study, which relies on the cognitive
skills measures from Hanushek and Kimko (2000), is likely to suffer from a combination of measurement issues and
small sample problems.
68
Similarly, the studies by Altinok (2007) and Appleton, Atherton, and Bleaney (2008) use initial test scores to
predict subsequent growth in a panel framework, confirming significant growth effects of cognitive skills.

47

system (which might become affordable with increased growth) do not relate systematically to
improved test scores.
The only substantial effect on the estimates is the inclusion of various measures of economic
institutions (security of property rights and openness of the economy). Including measures of
economic institutions, suggested for example by Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2005), does
lead to a reduction in the estimated impact of cognitive skills by about one third. However, as
Glaeser, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (2004) argue, there is a good case that human
capital causes better institutions as opposed to the opposite. Thus, one could consider the
estimate with institutional measures as a lower bound on any achievement effects. This estimate
remains highly significant and very substantial. Furthermore, in the sample of OECD countries,
where there is more limited variation in these broad institutions, the reduction is much smaller at
15 percent, and the institutional measures do not enter significantly.69
Second, an instrumental variable specification traces the impact on growth of just the
variations in achievement that arise from the previously identified institutional characteristics of
each country’s school system (exit examinations, autonomy, and private schooling).70 This
estimated impact is essentially the same as reported in the OLS regressions, lending support both
to the causal impact of more cognitive skills and to the conclusion that schooling policies can
have direct economic returns.
Third, one major concern is that countries with good economies also have good school
systems – implying that those that grow faster because of the basic economic factors also have
high achievement. To deal with this, immigrants to the U.S. who have been educated in their
home countries are compared to those educated just in the U.S. Since it is the single labor
market of the United States, any differences in labor-market returns associated with cognitive
skills cannot arise because of differences in the economies of their home country. Looking at
labor-market returns, the cognitive skills seen in the immigrant’s home country lead to higher
incomes – but only if the immigrant was educated at home. Immigrants from the same home
country schooled in the U.S. receive no return to home-country quality. This difference-indifferences approach rules out the possibility that test scores simply reflect cultural factors or
economic institutions of the home country.71 It also provides further support to the potential role
of schools to change the cognitive skills of citizens in economically meaningful ways.
Finally, perhaps the toughest test of causality is reliance on how changes in test scores over
time lead to changes in growth rates, thereby eliminating possible bias from any time-invariant
country-specific economic and cultural factors. Figure 15 relates the gains in test scores over

69

Hanushek and Woessmann (2008) also find a positive interaction between cognitive skills and institutional
measures, suggesting that good institutional quality and good cognitive skills can reinforce each other in advancing
economic development.
70
The statistical analysis employs an instrumental variable strategy that relies upon changes in achievement induced
by school structure. Its major limitation is that the instruments tend to be weak, given the small number of countries
that is included.
71
Two potential problems arise in this analysis. First, it just looks at labor-market returns for individuals and not the
aggregate impact on the economy of achievement differences. Second, those who migrate at a young enough age to
be educated in the U.S. might differ from those who migrate at later ages; while effects of the migration age that are
the same across countries are held constant in the regression, cross-country differences in age-migration patterns that
are related to the quality of the home-country education system would affect the results.

time to the gains in growth rates over time, revealing a consistent and strong positive
association.72 As with the other approaches, this analysis must presume that the pattern of
achievement changes has been occurring over a long time, because it is not the achievement of
school children but the skills of workers that count. Nonetheless, the consistency of the patterns
and the similarities of magnitudes of the estimates to the basic growth models is striking (see
Hanushek and Woessmann (2009a)).
Again, each approach to providing a deeper look at the issue of causation is subject to some
real uncertainty. The simple conclusion from the combined evidence is that differences in
cognitive skills lead to economically significant differences in economic growth. Nonetheless,
further investigations of the causal structure of growth relationships provide an obvious field for
further research. The approach in Hanushek and Woessmann (2009a) is to employ standard
microeconomic approaches to the investigation of causation in the context of cross-country
models. Alternative approaches could provide additional information. Similarly, expanded data
samples or different model specifications may prove useful.

5.3.4 Expanding Country Samples by Regional Tests from Developing Countries
A limiting factor in some of the prior analyses is the size of the samples, which in turn is
dictated by past participation in the international testing programs. This issue is especially
important when looking at developing countries and at different economic regions of the world.
Latin America, for example, has been a perennial concern because of its low growth and its
inability to show continued development, but Latin American countries are very lightly
represented in the prior testing programs.
While progress has been made, disappointment has been growing with Latin American
development strategies built on schooling because expansion of school attainment has not
guaranteed improved economic conditions (Easterly (2001)). In 1960, adult school attainment in
Latin America was surpassed only by OECD countries and was significantly ahead of East Asia,
Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Still, economic
growth in Latin America since 1960 has lagged so much behind growth in East Asia and MENA
that Latin American income per capita, which was considerably above the other three regions in
1960, has by now been overtaken by East Asia and MENA, leaving only Sub-Saharan Africa
behind.
The poor growth performance of Latin America despite its relatively high initial schooling
level remains a puzzle by conventional thinking. While economic research on Latin American
growth has given much attention to institutional and financial factors (e.g., Edwards, Esquivel,
and Márquez (2007) or Fernández-Arias, Manuelli, and Blyde (2005)), the basic puzzle remains
unresolved.

72

Only 12 OECD countries have participated in international tests over a long enough period to provide the
possibility of looking at trends in test performance over more than 30 years. The analysis simply considers a
regression of test scores on time for countries with multiple observations (allowing for student age and subject of
tests). The trends in growth rates are determined in a similar manner: annual growth rates are regressed on a time
trend. The plot provides the pattern of slopes in the test regression to slopes in the growth-rate regression.
Hanushek and Woessmann (2009a) consider more complicated statistical relationships, but the overall results hold
up.

49

To compare countries within the region, Hanushek and Woessmann (2009b) make use of
regional measures of cognitive skills that were designed specifically for Latin American
countries. Regional achievement tests from the Laboratorio Latinoamericano de Evaluación de
la Calidad de la Educación (LLECE) were conducted in 1997 and in 2006 (see Table 2).
Together, the two tests cover all sixteen Latin American countries usable in analyses of national
growth, which is an important expansion compared to the seven Latin American countries that
ever participated in a worldwide test. Neither of the two tests is perfect for such analyses,
because they measure performance just in early grades and because both are very recent.
Nonetheless, these regional tests offer the possibility of explaining the large differences in
growth among the countries of Latin America.
Their results using the regional test data support the important role of cognitive skills in
understanding Latin American growth. These test scores are statistically and quantitatively
significant in predicting economic growth differences in intra-regional growth regressions. They
increase the explanatory power of standard growth models considerably and render the effect of
years of schooling insignificant. Also in Latin America, schooling appears relevant for
economic growth only insofar as it actually raises the knowledge that students gain as depicted in
tests of cognitive skills.
Hanushek and Woessmann (2009b) also splice the regional test information into the
worldwide tests discussed above. Results of the worldwide regressions extended to 59 countries
confirm the consistent effect of cognitive skills. They can even resolve the Latin American
growth puzzle: The poor growth performance of Latin American countries can be fully
accounted for by their poor performance on student achievement tests.
This analysis suggests that an even wider set of student assessments – those included in
Table 2 – can be usefully employed to understand fundamentals of the aggregate economies.
The expansion of sampling, in this case to regional economies with limited participation in past
tests, permits more detailed analysis than previously possible.
While part of the sampling problem is automatically being dealt with through the continued
expansion from new countries added to the PISA and TIMSS programs, other issues of the
appropriateness of those tests and of the ancillary survey data suggest that these other data sets
should not be neglected. For example, sub-Saharan Africa is only minimally included in prior
testing. Furthermore, the worldwide tests may simply be too difficult for the typical student in
many countries in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. Because test efficiency requires the
international assessments to focus testing time on discriminating performance in the vicinity of
the international mean, there may not be sufficient test questions that reliably distinguish
performance at the level of many developing countries. This limits the power of these tests in
discriminating performance at low levels and makes intra-regional comparisons in these regions
unreliable. Splicing regional tests into the worldwide tests therefore provides a viable option to
expand international analysis to countries far below the mean of OECD countries.73

73

The value of regional testing programs could also be expanded substantially by ensuring that the assessments
included specific linking questions with PISA and/or TIMSS. This practice would permit each country to ascertain
where it stands in the world achievement rankings.

50

5.3.5 Basic Skills, Top Performance, and Growth
The modeling efforts to date have concentrated most attention on mean achievement and on
the implications of overall differences in human capital. However, this sidesteps important
questions facing education officials in many countries. Some argue in favor of elitist school
systems which focus on the top performers as potential future managers of the economy and
drivers of innovation. This approach, for example, appears to match the historic policies of
India, with a set of premier engineering schools coexisting with a large illiterate population.
Others favor more egalitarian school systems to ensure well-educated masses that will be capable
of implementing established technologies. This approach would coincide with development
policies such as the Education for All initiative (UNESCO (2005)) that concentrate on raising the
skills of all to minimal levels. Do these choices have a discernible effect on aggregate economic
performance?
To capture these differences in the distributional patterns of the test-score performance in
different countries, Hanushek and Woessmann (2009a) use the micro data from each of the
international assessments to calculate measures of the share of students in each country who
reach at least basic skills as well as those who reach superior performance levels. Specifically,
they use performance of at least 400 test-score points on the PISA international scale – one
standard deviation below the OECD mean – as the threshold of basic literacy and numeracy and
one standard deviation above the OECD as the measure of superior performance. They then
employ these alternative measures of skill distribution instead of mean performance in their
cross-country growth models.
Their analysis suggests that both measures of the test-score distribution are significantly
related to economic growth, either when entered individually or jointly. Both the basic-skill and
the top-performing dimensions of educational performance appear separately important for
growth.
These early results, however, still leave open a series of analytical and policy questions. For
example, while these models indicate the relative impacts of improving the different levels of
performance, policies built upon these would have to use other information about the costs or
feasibility of changing people at the different skill levels.

5.3.6 IQ Models
An alternative perspective is that IQ differences among nations are driving the results
described previously. The potential difference from the preceding analysis is the common view
that IQs are fixed and not subject to schooling or environmental influences. If true, this would
suggest both that IQ measures might more accurately represent the relevant cognitive skills and
the analytics of them might be less prone to the types of identification issues discussed. This
fixed-factor view, often related to ideas of the high degree of heritability of IQs, of course is not
the uniform view of researchers in the area. Indeed, in the economics literature, Goldberger and
Manski (1995) and Heckman (1995) have clear analyses showing that families and schools have

51

strong effects on measured IQ.74 Thus, the most reasonable interpretation of IQ studies is that
they apply an alternative measure of cognitive skills to the international assessments previously
described.
All studies of the economic impacts of IQ are based on the international IQ scores compiled
by Lynn and Vanhanen (2002, 2006).75 They have assembled data from specific national
samples using a variety of measurement instruments. The earliest work by Weede and Kämpf
(2002) mimics that of the work described previously (see Table 15). Similar to the analyses of
cognitive skills, IQ differences have a strong and significant effect on growth rates even allowing
for differences in school attainment. Jones and Schneider (2006) provide a series of robustness
analyses, similar to Sala-i-Martin, Doppelhofer, and Miller (2004) with the addition of the Lynn
and Vanhanen (2002) measures of IQ. They demonstrate that the IQ has a strong predictive
power with economic growth. They also show that the measures are very strongly correlated
with the labor-force quality measures of Hanushek and Kimko (2000). Ram (2007) estimates
models similar to the augmented neoclassical production functions of Mankiw, Romer, and Weil
(1992). The general conclusion is that school attainment appears less relevant when IQ measures
(again from Lynn and Vanhanen (2002)) are included in the analysis. Finally, Jones and
Schneider (2010) use IQ measures of skills to account for variations in immigrant wages, similar
to the analyses of Hanushek and Kimko (2000) and Hanushek and Woessmann (2009a). They
conclude that IQ is a powerful predictor of wages and, relatedly, that it explains a significant
portion of earnings differences across countries.
The real question with these analyses is what exactly is being measured. The underlying IQ
scores by country come from an idiosyncratic collection of national data that relies on
specialized samples for specific cohorts and subsets of the population.76 Thus, the question that
arises is how much measurement error there is in an underlying skill dimension. Hunt and
Wittmann (2008) provide a direct analysis (albeit in terms of the level of GDP per capita) of the
empirical value of IQ scores versus PISA scores. They conclude that PISA scores are better
predictors of GDP per capita than the Lynn and Vanhanen (2002) measures of IQ. Lynn and
Mikk (2007, 2009) confirm the very high correlations between IQ scores and either TIMSS or

74

Much of this recent discussion in the economics literature came in response to Herrnstein and Murray (1994), who
argued that the labor-market relationships to relatively fixed IQ measures had strong implications for social policy.
Much of the discussion is, of course, outside of economics. While there is ongoing controversy to how genetics and
environment are seen as influencing IQ (see, for example, the exchange by Rose (2009) and Ceci and Williams
(2009)), it is clear that environment can have substantial impact on measured IQ (e.g., Turkheimer et al. (2003)).
Another source of discussion is the so-called “Flynn effect” where political scientist James Flynn noted that IQ
scores had been rapidly rising in many nations around the world over the 20th Century. For discussions of this, see
Dickens and Flynn (2001) and Flynn (2007), both of which argue that aggregate societal factors can affect the
measured national data.
75
Their analyses of economic outcomes relate the level of GDP per capita to IQ scores. It is difficult to see these
analyses in level form as identifying the impact of skills. Their data series, however, have been used extensively in
other analyses.
76
As Hunt and Wittmann (2008) point out, concerns with the data include that values for the majority of countries
are derived from an unclearly specified method drawing on data from nearby countries and that most data points are
not derived from representative samples. For example, the value for Ethiopia is based on the IQ scores of a highly
selected group that had emigrated to Israel, and the value for Equatorial Guinea, the lowest IQ estimate in the data,
refers to a group of children in a home for the developmentally disabled in Spain.

52

PISA scores. More importantly, this analysis questions whether the simple relationships
estimated in Lynn and Vanhanen (2002) are causal (as Lynn and Vanhanen (2002) assert).
The conclusion from the various models of the impact of national IQ scores on economic
outcomes is that IQ provides another potential measure of cognitive skills. If accurate, the Lynn
and Vanhanen IQ data provide for a considerable expansion of the sample sizes, reaching 113
nations (Lynn and Vanhanen (2006), Appendix 1). Nonetheless, most of the analyses would
suggest that this measure is noticeably more error prone than the international test data stressed
here. Additionally, rather than capturing innate differences, they are amenable to family and
school influences – opening a similar set of identification issues as discussed here (but not
addressed in these analyses).
5.4 Conclusions on the Economic Impact of Differences in Cognitive Skills

The international data on the individual returns to cognitive skills begin to paint an
interesting picture of the value of human capital in the labor market – a picture going beyond the
common but misleading view that only schooling attainment matters. First, while labor markets
in a broad set of countries clearly reward individuals with higher skill as measured by
assessments of math and science, the rewards do appear to vary significantly across countries.
The underlying determinants of these differential rewards remain an important but unanswered
question. Second, variations in skills within countries have clear impacts on the distribution of
incomes. Here again, while the facts are relatively clear, the interaction of skills and rewards –
which is a fundamental determinant of the distributional outcomes – is much less understood.
The results of growth modeling that employ measures of national cognitive skills strongly
suggest that the basic human capital model is very relevant for aggregate outcomes. Variations
in skills measured by international math and science tests are strongly related to variations in
economic growth, and they solve many of the difficult measurement problems with the more
traditional school attainment measures.
At the same time, there are many issues to be addressed in future work. Clearly the
limitations of having just cross-country variations for a limited number of countries raise
uncertainties with the results. Most importantly, given the myriad of differences among nations,
confirming any causal impact is difficult. Each of these issues is high on the research agenda,
particularly given the rapid expansion of test information from expanded new testing
opportunities.

6. Conclusion and Outlook
The economic literature on international educational achievement has expanded our
understanding of the determinants and economic consequences of international educational
achievement tremendously. Considering that, with few antecedents, this literature is only a
decade old, it has clearly covered a lot of ground and made remarkable progress. In doing so, it
has exploited the possibilities opened up by the international data to raise fundamental questions,
ones not amenable to any simple within-country analysis. For example, this work highlights the
crucial role of educational achievement in understanding the vast international differences in
economic well-being. It also begins to suggest some key factors that account for the immense
international differences in educational achievement.
53

At the same time, by the very nature of the limited degrees of freedom in cross-country
identification, it can mostly reveal broad patterns. At the very least, a lot of the details of
specific implementation issues related to any policy application obviously must be left for
national approaches.
Given its infancy, there is obviously still considerable scope for future advances in the
economic literature on international evidence on educational achievement. Clear directions
forward include exploring further the institutional variation and making more use of regional
information, yielding larger numbers of independent observations. Interesting extensions could
also go beyond general schooling to cover topics in vocational and higher education.
A topic unexplored by economists is also the international tests in non-traditional subjects,
such as foreign languages, civic education, and information technology. More generally, some
of the rich background information contained in the international studies could be explored
further, and part of it may provide information on relevant non-cognitive skills. For example,
recent work by Falck and Woessmann (2010) attempts to derive measures of entrepreneurial
intentions from the international background data, and chapter 6 in Woessmann, Luedemann,
Schuetz, and West (2009) explores such measures of non-cognitive outcomes as student morale
and commitment, non-disruptive behavior, disciplinary climate, and tardiness. Further
information on non-cognitive skills may be derived from the international background
questionnaires. As a more distant outlook, international testing of non-cognitive skills would be
an obvious challenge.
Methodologically, further exploration of quasi-experimental settings in the international data
should be high on the agenda. When analyzing determinants of educational achievement,
building panel datasets from the more extensively emerging international tests could help in this
regard and allow the evaluation of educational reforms in different countries.
In the more distant future, it is tempting to envision what research will be able to do with the
sort of achievement data that will be available in 20 to 30 years from now. The number of
participating countries is as high as 57 in both PISA 2006 and TIMSS 2007, and more than 60
countries are currently planning to participate in the next PISA and TIMSS cycles. With these
sets of comparable achievement data for extensive samples of countries being linked to
subsequent economic growth, and with the emerging long panels of regular achievement data for
large samples of countries, the outlook for future research in the economics of international
differences in educational achievement is clearly bright.

Notes: Coefficient estimates from a student-level regression within each country of the mean of math and science
performance in the TIMSS-95 and TIMSS-Repeat international tests on books at home, which is a categorical
variable with five categories. Regressions control for age, gender, family status, student born in country, mother
born in country, father born in country, interactions between the three immigration variables and books, and a
dummy for the second test cycle. All estimates are statistically significantly different from zero at the 1 percent
level.

in comparison to lower-secondary school (PISA 2003), in both cases measured as difference to the international
mean of national standard deviations in each test. The lines indicate the change in performance dispersion from
primary to lower-secondary school. The black solid lines indicate school systems that track their students into
different school types before the age of 16, while the red dashed lines refer to those school systems that do not track
their students by this age.

Notes: Dependent variable: PISA 2003 international mathematics test score. Least-squares regressions weighted
by students’ sampling probability. The models additionally control for imputation dummies and interaction terms
between imputation dummies and the variables. Robust standard errors adjusted for clustering at the school level in
parentheses (clustering at country level for all country-level variables, which are private operation, government
funding, external exit exams, GDP per capita, and expenditure per student). Significance level (based on clusteringrobust standard errors): *** 1 percent, ** 5 percent, * 10 percent.
