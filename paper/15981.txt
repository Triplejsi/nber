Commercial Imperialism? Political Influence and Trade During the Cold War

ABSTRACT
We exploit the recent declassification of CIA documents and examine whether there is evidence of
US power being used to influence countries' decisions regarding international trade. We measure US
influence using a newly constructed annual panel of CIA interventions aimed at installing and supporting
leaders during the Cold War. Our presumption is that the US had greater influence over foreign leaders
that were installed and backed by the CIA. We show that following CIA interventions there was an
increase in foreign-country imports from the US, but there was no similar increase in foreign-country
exports to the US. Further, the increase in US exports was concentrated in industries in which the US
had a comparative disadvantage in producing, not a comparative advantage. This is consistent with
US influence being used to create a larger foreign market for American products. Our analysis is able
to rule out decreased bilateral trade costs, changing political ideology, and an increased supply of US
loans and grants as explanations for the increase in US exports to the intervened country. We provide
evidence that the increase in US exports arose through direct purchases of US products by foreign
governments.

1. Introduction
The possibility that political influence and power play an important role in international trade has
long been recognized.1 However, despite its importance, empirical evidence identifying the effects
of influence on trade remains rare.2 In this study, we provide evidence that during the Cold War,
US influence over leaders installed and supported by the CIA was used to create a larger foreign
market for US products.
Our analysis relies on the use of recently declassified CIA documents to generate a timeand country-specific measure of US political influence. We identify instances where US covert
services engaged in interventions to install and/or support political leaders in other countries.
Our presumption is that the US had greater influence over foreign leaders that were installed
and supported by the CIA. Examining the relationship between US influence and annual bilateral
trade, we find that US influence raised the share of total imports that the intervened country
purchased from the US. We find no change in the total value of goods imported from the world,
i.e. of trade creation. Instead, interventions caused a shift away from the purchase of products
from non-US foreign countries and towards products from the US. Despite the robust finding of
increased imports of goods from the US, intervened-country exports to the US did not increase.
This finding is consistent with US political influence being used to create a larger market for US
products in the intervened country.
As a further test of the political influence hypothesis, we examine differences in the effect of
interventions on autocratic and democratic regimes. Existing theory and evidence (e.g., Grossman
and Helpman, 1994, Mitra, Thomakos, and Ulubasoglu, 2002) suggests that US influence should
have been greater in autocratic regimes, where leaders are less accountable to the general population and have greater freedom to choose policies. We find that, consistent with the political
influence hypothesis, CIA interventions only increased the share of imports from the US in autocratic regimes, and had no effect in democratic regimes.
Although our baseline difference-in-difference estimating equations control for country-specific
time-invariant factors (with country fixed effects) and time-specific country-invariant factors (with
1 See for example Hirschman (1945), Galtung (1971) and Antràs and Padro-i-Miquel (2008). As well, the recent
book by Findlay and O’Rourke (2007), Power and Plenty, uses historical evidence to show that power, influence, and
coercion are central to understanding the history of international trade. Also from a historical perspective, Mitchener
and Weidenmier (2008) document the important role that colonial empires played in international trade during the late
19th and early 20th centuries, and Head, Mayer, and Ries (2010) examine how trade evolved following independence.
2 One exception is Yeats (1990), which we discuss below.

time-period fixed effects), there is still concern that omitted time- and country-varying factors may
bias the estimates. A primary concern is that interventions may have been more likely following a
temporary decline in imports from the US. This form of selection will result in inflated estimates of
the effect of interventions on imports from the US. We undertake a number of strategies to control
for this. We include controls for pre-trends in the dependent variable and for pre-intervention fixed
effects. We also control for observable factors that are likely determinants of pre-intervention dips
in imports and correlated with the onset of CIA interventions. Specifically, we control for indicator
variables for the existence of US sanctions placed against the foreign country and for the existence
of conflict between the country and the US. The results remain robust to these measures taken to
address the selection of CIA interventions.
Even taking the correlations as causal, there are many alternative interpretations for the estimated effects. In addition to the political influence explanation, there are three leading alternative
interpretations. The first is that interventions decreased the bilateral trading costs between the US
and the intervened country, and this caused an asymmetric increase in trade flows. The second is
that the newly installed and/or supported leaders were ideologically more aligned with Western
capitalist countries. This caused the foreign country to import more from all Western countries, not
just the US. The third explanation is that following an intervention, US foreign grants and loans
increased, and this caused purchases of US products to rise.
We test for the trade costs explanation by examining the effects of interventions on imports
from the US in different industries. We show that the increase in imports from the US was
greatest for goods in which the US had a relative comparative disadvantage in producing. That
is, following interventions, the new goods that were shipped from the US to the intervened
country were products that US firms were relatively uncompetitive in producing. This pattern
is inconsistent with decreasing trade costs being the source of increased imports from the US.
Increased integration between two countries should cause each country to specialize more in their
comparative advantage products and export these to the foreign country. Standard models of
international trade do not predict greater specialization in comparative disadvantage industries.
The finding is consistent with US influence being used to create a larger market for US products
that producers would otherwise have difficulty selling internationally.
We then turn to the political ideology explanation. The increase in imports from the US may
have arisen because the newly installed leaders were more pro-Western and pro-capitalist and

2

therefore they imported more from all Western countries, including the US. To test this explanation,
we examine the effects of interventions on imports from all countries, not just from the US. We
find no evidence that US interventions caused an increase in imports from countries that were
ideologically aligned with the US.
Last, we turn to the increased US loans and grants explanation. We test directly whether US economic aid, military aid, food aid, or Export-Import Bank loans increased following an intervention.
We find that interventions were followed by a significant increase in economic aid, food aid, and
Export-Import Bank loans. However, we also find that these only account for approximately 20%
of the total effect of interventions on increased imports from the US.
Having examined alternative explanations, we then turn to mechanisms. We provide evidence
that the increased imports of US products arose through direct government purchases. We find that
the effect of interventions on the purchase of US products is increasing in the government’s share
of GDP. For the countries in the sample with the smallest government share, we find that the effect
of interventions on US imports is close to zero. This suggests that essentially all of the effect can
be explained by government purchases of US products. As well, for a typical country, government
purchases of tradeables is large enough to account for the estimated increase in trade following
an intervention. We also find that interventions immediately led to a surge in imports. This
provides further evidence for government purchases, which could have responded very quickly
to US influence. We also check for additional channels, such as tariff changes or foreign direct
investment, but find no evidence that these play an important role.
Our use of CIA interventions to measure changes in US political influence links our study to
a small literature that examines other aspects of CIA activities. Most closely related is Berger,
Corvalan, Easterly, and Satyanath (2010), who use lower frequency data at five year intervals to
examine the effect of interventions on democracy. They find that CIA and KGB interventions have
a negative and long-lasting effect on subsequent democracy, a result that dovetails nicely with our
finding that US influence was strongest in autocratic regimes. Following an intervention, the US
would have had little incentive to promote democracy, since this would have made influence less
effective.
Dube, Kaplan, and Naidu (2008) examine the stock prices of US companies in Iran, Guatemala,
Cuba, and Chile before and after the CIA-authorized plans for covert coups. They find that the
stock returns of companies that were exposed in the foreign-country and well-connected to the

3

CIA increased immediately after the authorizations, which provides evidence that top-secret plans
were leaked to investors. The focus of their paper complements our analysis here. Since Dube et al.
(2008) are interested in the effects of top-secret information flows (and not of the interventions
themselves), they do not include the period of the actual intervention in their analysis. In contrast,
our analysis looks at the consequences of the interventions being successfully carried out.
Our analysis also extends previous theoretical analyses of the interplay between political influence and international trade. The hypothesis that influence and power plays a role in international
trade dates back to at least Hirschman (1945). More recently, the theoretical contribution of Antràs
and Padro-i-Miquel (2008) examines the welfare impacts when political influence can affect trade
and trade policies. Our findings also complement the few existing studies that attempt to empirically estimate the effects of political influence on trade flows. An example is Alexander Yeats’
(1990) analysis, showing that among African countries, former colonies pay a 20 to 30% premium
on the price of imported steel when importing from their former colonizer.3
The next section of the paper describes our data and their sources. Section 3 reports our baseline
estimating equations and results. We document that CIA interventions were followed by increased
imports of US goods, no increase in exports to the US, and no increase in total trade. We further
show that the increase in imports from the US is found among autocracies only. Sections 4 and 5
then turn to the issues of causality and robustness. In section 6, we test for alternative explanations. We show that the findings cannot be explained by decreased trade costs, changing political
ideology, or an increase in US loans and grants. In section 7 we turn to specific mechanisms and
provide evidence that government purchases play a central role. Section 8 concludes.

2. CIA Intervention Data
As a source of variation in US influence over a country, we rely on historic episodes where the CIA
intervened in a foreign country to either install a new leader or to provide support to an existing
leader to help maintain the power of the regime. To identify these episodes, we rely on a number
of studies examining the history of the Cold War, much of which is based on recently declassified
documents. Using these sources, we have constructed an annual data set of interventions un3 Also

related are existing studies that provide evidence for power and influence playing a role in the international
arena. For example, Dreher and Jensen (2007) show that IMF conditionality is correlated with whether countries vote inline with the US in the UN General Assembly. Similarly, Kilby (2009) shows that the World Bank’s structural adjustment
conditions are less stringent for countries whose voting in the UN is more aligned with the US. Kuziemko and Werker
(2006) show that when countries have a seat on the UN security council they receive more foreign aid from the US.

dertaken by the CIA. We also construct analogous measures for Soviet KGB interventions, which
we use as a control in the analysis. The most heavily used sources include Blum (2004), Weiner
(2007), Westad (2005), Yergin (1991), and the Library of Congress’ Country Studies Series for the CIA
interventions, and Andrew and Mitrokhin (2000, 2005) for KGB interventions. Full details of the
data construction and sources are reported in a data appendix that will be posted on the authors’
web page upon publication.
Our baseline measure of CIA interventions is an indicator variable that equals one, in a country
and year, if the CIA either installed a foreign leader or provided covert support for the regime
once in power. We label this variable US influencet,c . The activities used by the CIA to install
and help maintain the power of specific regimes are many and varied. They include the creation
and dissemination of (often false) propaganda, usually through radio, television, newspapers and
pamphlets. They also included covert political operations, which typically consisted of the provision of funds and expertise for political campaigns. More invasive tactics included the destruction
of physical infrastructure and capital, as well as covert paramilitary operations, that included the
supply of arms and military equipment, direct involvement in insurgency and counterinsurgency
operations, and the coordination of coups and assassinations (Johnson, 1989, 1992).
There are many instances in which the CIA set out to remove an existing leader and install a new
leader in power. The CIA-organized coups in Iran in 1953, Guatemala in 1954, and Chile in 1973
are the most well-known examples of such cases. For these interventions, the indicator variable
US influencet,c takes on the value of one. In other cases, the CIA began to provide support for
leaders currently in power. In these cases, the CIA did not engage in activities to install the leader
into power, but once in power, at some point, the CIA began to engage in activities to help maintain
the power of the regime. Typically, these were covert counter-insurgency operations undertaken
by the CIA. We code as one cases in which the leader maintains power with the help of the CIA.
A good example of this is the CIA’s involvement in Haiti. Paul Magloire, Papa Doc Duvalier,
and Baby Doc Duvalier, were not installed by the US, but they were reliant on CIA support to
help maintain their power. As a robustness check, we also create a second more narrowly defined
measure that codes as zero interventions where the CIA engaged in activities that propped-up a
leader it did not originally install. As we show in section 5, the results are robust to using this
alternative measure.

To illustrate the construction of our variable, consider the history of the CIA in Chile. The
sequence of CIA interventions is reported in table 1. During the 1964 Chilean elections, the CIA
provided covert funding and support for the Christian Democratic Party candidate Eduardo Frei
Montalvo. Eduardo Frei won the presidential election in 1964, and continued to receive CIA
support while he was in power. In the 1970 election, Salvador Allende, a candidate of a coalition of
leftist parties, was elected, and remained in power until the CIA orchestrated coup of 1973. After
the coup, Augusto Pinochet took power and was backed by the CIA. Since US influencet,c equals
one in all periods in which a leader is installed or supported by the CIA, for Chile the variable
equals one from 1964 to 1970 when Eduardo Frei was in power. It equals zero in 1971 and 1972, the
years when Salvador Allende was in office (since he was not supported or installed by the CIA).
It then equals one from 1973 to 1988, the years when Augusto Pinochet, who was installed and

6

supported by the CIA, was in power.4
Our sample of 156 countries includes all countries except the United States and countries that
were part of the former Soviet Union.5 We also exclude from the sample countries whose borders
change significantly during the period. This includes Bangladesh, Pakistan, Germany, Vietnam,
and Yemen. Among the 156 countries, 50 were subject to at least one CIA intervention between
1947 and 1989.6
Figure 1 shows the total number of interventions among all countries in each year between 1947
and 1989. That is, the figure reports the number of countries for which US influencet,c = 1 in each
year. The figure illustrates a number of patterns present in the data. The first is that interventions
were common. In an average year between 1947 and 1989, 24 countries were experiencing a CIA
intervention. Among the group of countries that experienced an intervention between 1947 and
1989, the typical country experienced 21 years of interventions.
The figure also shows that the total number of interventions increased after 1947, peaked around
the 1970s, and then fell until 1989. This is consistent with the history of the CIA. Between 1953 and
1961 covert action increased significantly, with attention focused on political action, particularly
support to political figures and political parties. The 1960s witnessed a continued presence of CIA
covert activities, although there was a shift towards greater paramilitary activities. The period
from 1964 to 1967 is known to have been the high point of CIA covert activities. The post-1967
slow-down was brought about, in part, by the 1967 Ramparts magazine article that exposed the
CIA’s funding of national student groups and other private organizations (Leary, 1984). Consistent
with this history, figure 1 shows a leveling off of convert interventions in the late 1960s until the
mid-1970s, after which the number falls. The lagged decline after 1967 results from the persistence
of interventions. Typically, newly installed or newly supported leaders remained in power, and
continued to be supported by the CIA, for their remaining tenure.
An alternative to looking at interventions over time, is to examine the pattern of interventions
across countries. The map shown in figure 2 reports, for each country, the fraction of years
4 The

onset and offset years of CIA intervention episodes could potentially be coded as zero or one, since these are
transition years. We have chosen to code these as one throughout. As we discuss in section 5, none of our results depend
on the decision.
5 Our panel is unbalanced, since countries do not enter the sample until they gain independence. In 1947, the sample
includes 66 countries. In 1989, the number is 156.
6 Similarly, 23 countries were subject to at least one KGB intervention. KGB interventions are defined in the analogous
manner as for CIA interventions.

between 1947 and 1989 for which there was a CIA intervention.7 The cross-country distribution of
interventions is consistent with the descriptive history of the CIA during the Cold War era. The
CIA intervened most heavily in Latin America, but also in a few European countries - namely, Italy
and Greece - as well as in a number of countries in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.8
The map also helps to illustrate exactly what our intervention variable captures and what it does
not capture. For example, our intervention variable is zero for Angola throughout the period. This
is the case despite the heavy and well-known involvement of the CIA in Angola’s civil war (see
e.g. Weissman, 1979). The CIA provided covert support for the anticommunist group Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). However, the group was never successful at gaining
power from the Movimento Popular de Libertação de Angola (MPLA). Because the US-backed
UNITA forces never gained control of the government, our variable is not coded as one for Angola,
despite clear intervention by the CIA in the country. The example illustrates that our intervention
measure is not a measure of all CIA meddling or activities in a country. Rather, it is an indicator of

CIA activities that were successful at either installing a new leader or in maintaining the power of
an existing leader.
Using CIA covert activities to measure changes in US influence over foreign countries has a
number of particularly attractive characteristics. First, because these interventions were covert
at the time, they were largely unaffected by US public opinion, and from the opinion of other
countries in the international arena. This reduces one source of endogeneity for our measure.
Further, because the interventions affect the leader in power, they are significant and plausibly
have a significant impact on US influence over the regime.
Our measure of covert CIA interventions that install and/or support foreign regimes can be
interpreted as a measure of US “client states” or “puppet leaders”, which are well-established
subjects of analysis in the qualitative political science literature (e.g., Sylvan and Majeski, 2009).
Therefore, an alternative interpretation of our analysis is of the effects of US influence on client
states and puppet leaders on bilateral trade flows.

3. Baseline Results
A. Estimating Equations
We now turn to our baseline estimates of the economic consequences of US interventions. Our first
estimating equation looks at the effects of US interventions on the share of total imports from the
US:

t,c denotes country c’s imports from the US in year t, mt,c denotes country c’s aggregate imports

from all countries.9 Since the time period being considered is the Cold War, t ranges from 1947 to
1989.
The dependent variable, ln

mUS
t,c
,
mW
t,c

is the natural log of the share of country c’s total imports

from the US in year t. As we show in Appendix A, the appropriate dependent variable for the
theoretically derived estimating equation is the natural log of the import share, rather than the
import share itself.10
9 World imports include imports from all countries, even those that are not observations in the estimating equation
e.g., Soviet Union, United States, and countries that experienced significant border changes.
10 One consequence of this is that a small number of observations, with zero trade flows, are dropped from the sample
in our baseline specifications. As we discuss in section 5, alternative estimation techniques that do not omit the zerotrade observations provide qualitatively identical results.

10

The coefficient of interest is β, the estimated impact of CIA interventions on the log share of
imports that are from the US. Because equation (1) includes year fixed effects and country fixed
effects, αt and αc , our estimating equation takes the form of a difference-in-difference estimation.
Because our sample only includes US trade shares (and not a country’s trade shares with other
countries), country fixed effects are equivalent to country-pair fixed effects. They therefore capture
many of the standard country-pair specific measures that are standard in bilateral gravity regressions, such as the geographic distance between trading partners, a common language, a common
legal/colonial origins, contiguous borders, etc.
The equation also controls for lags of the dependent variable.11 This is done to capture the
persistence of past trade, which may occur because of the existence of fixed trade costs as in Roberts
and Tybout (1997) or through temporally-persistant determinants of trade. Because equation (1)
includes time-period fixed effects, country fixed effects, as well as lags of the dependent variable,
it suffers from the well-known Nickell (1981) bias. In section 5A, we show that our results are not
affected by the bias. This is not surprising given that the Nickell bias converges to zero as the time
dimension of the panel increases. Since we have a large number of time periods in our panel (43
years), the actual bias can be shown to be small.
The vector Xt,c includes a set of controls that vary across countries and years. We control for
Soviet/KGB interventions, measured in the same manner as CIA interventions. We also include
two indicator variables that capture a country’s openness to foreign trade, since trade openness
may affect trade with the US differentially relative to other countries of the world. The first is
an indicator variable that equals one if country c is a member of GATT in year t. The second is an
indicator variable that equals one if country c had signed the New York Convention by t.12 We also
include controls for the natural log of per capita income, and the natural log of aggregate income.
These controls, which are typically included in gravity regressions, may influence the share of
imports from the US through scale and/or income effects. They would also have an effect if, for
example, the US trades disproportionately more with higher income or larger countries. Given the
recent studies by Jones and Olken (2005, 2009) and Duflo and Chattopadhyay (2004) that show that
leaders matter, we are also careful to control for leadership turnover and leader tenure. We control

Arbitral Awards. The agreement ensures that among signatory countries, in cases involving parties from two countries,
court rulings and arbitration awards made in one country must be recognized in the other country.

of the tenure of the current leader. Our final control variable is motivated by the findings from
Berger et al. (2010), showing that interventions had an adverse effect on democracy. We control for
the combined Polity measure from the Polity IV Database, which is a variable that takes on integer
values ranging from −10 (strong autocracy) to +10 (strong democracy). We include fixed effects,
one for each value of the polity measure.
The unit of observation in equation (1) is a country and year. An alternative estimation strategy
is to estimate a standard bilateral gravity model, where the unit of observation is a directional
country-pair in a year, and the dependent variable is the volume of imports from one country
to another country. One could then examine whether a US intervention increases the flow of
imports from the US to the intervened country. Our equation (1) is constructed to capture this
same variation, but the advantage of equation (1) is that it does not include a large number of
observations in which the US is not a trading partner. This alternative strategy, even with clustered
standard errors, runs the risk of producing downward-biased standard errors (see Bertrand, Duflo,
and Mullainathan, 2004). Our estimation strategy aggregates all trade between non-US trade
partners to be part of aggregate World trade, which we use to normalize trade flows with the
US. The result is that we only have N × T observations rather than N ( N − 1) T observations in our
sample (where N is the number of countries and T is the number of time periods). As we show
in section 5, our results are qualitatively identical if we estimate a bilateral gravity model with all
country-pairs.
Our analysis also examines the effect of CIA interventions on the share of the foreign-country’s
exports that are shipped to the US:

US influence. In the top graph one can see that the US import share stayed stable from 1964 to
1970, when Eduardo Frei was in power and was being supported by the CIA (US influence = 1).
The bottom graph shows that, unlike imports, exports to the US declined steadily during this
period. After 1970, when Salvador Allende took power (US influence = 0), imports fell dramatically
(top graph), while there is no dramatic change in exports (bottom graph). After Pinochet took
power (US influence = 1), one observes a larger and more immediate increase for imports than for
exports. Overall, figure 3 illustrates that imports from the US tend to be more responsive to CIA
interventions than exports to the US.
We now document this pattern more formally by estimating equations (1) and (2). Column 1 of
table 2 reports estimates of equation (1) for the full sample. The coefficient on the US intervention
measure, US influence, is positive and statistically significant. The estimated coefficient indicates

Observations

Notes : The unit of observation is a country c in year t, where t ranges from 1947 to 1989. All regressions include year fixed effects, country fixed effects, a Soviet intervention
control, two lags of the dependent variable, ln per capita income, ln total income, an indicator for leader turnover, current leader tenure, an indicator variable for GATT
membership, an indicator variable for signing the NY convention, and Polity fixed effects. Coefficients are reported with robust standard errors in brackets. ***, **, and *

that an intervention increased the share of imports from the US by 10.5 percent. We also examine
the effects of CIA interventions on the share of a foreign country’s exports shipped to the US
by estimating equation (2). The estimates are reported in column 4 of table 2. The coefficient
for US influence is very small in magnitude and not statistically different from zero. Overall, the
estimates from columns 1 and 4 show that although interventions significantly increased the share
of a country’s imports that are from the US, they had no effects on the share of a country’s exports
that go to the US. As we will see, this asymmetry is extremely robust.
As an initial test for whether the surge in intervened-country imports from the US arose because
of an increase in US influence, we examine the effect of interventions separately for autocracies and
democracies. The motivation behind this distinction derives from a straightforward logic that is at
the core of a number of models in economics and political science. The best example is Grossman
and Helpman’s (1994) “Protection for Sale” model. In their model, governments set the level of a
socially suboptimal policy, namely trade tariffs. In making their decisions governments trade off
the effects of the policy on aggregate welfare against the private benefits that are received from

14

groups that have political influence. The key parameter affecting the equilibrium policy is a, the
weight the government places on aggregate welfare relative to the private benefits the government
receives from setting a distortionary policy. In reality the parameter a is determined, in part, by
the accountability of the leader to the welfare of its citizens. All else equal, we expect a to be
much higher in democracies than autocracies. Empirical estimates of Grossman and Helpman’s
a parameter across autocracies and democracies provide strong empirical support for this (e.g.,
Mitra et al., 2002).
Grossman and Helpman’s model provides a testable prediction in our setting. We are interested
in empirically identifying whether CIA interventions allowed the US to exert greater influence over
intervened countries, and whether this was used to persuade foreign leaders to choose policies that
benefited the US. This setting is exactly analogous to the Grossman and Helpman scenario, except
that the US government takes the place of the private lobbies. In their model, those with the ability
to influence policy will be more successful in autocracies where a is low, since the government
is less accountable to its citizens. Therefore, if interventions increased the imports of US goods
because of US influence, we expect to find larger effects of interventions in autocracies than in
democracies.
To test this, we first group our observations (i.e., country-year pairs) into two categories: autocracies and democracies. A country c in year t is defined as being an autocracy if in both year t
and year t − 1 its Polity scores are zero or less. Estimates of equations (1) and (2), with the sample
restricted to autocracies only, are reported in columns 2 and 5 of table 2. Column 2 shows that
among the sample of autocracies, like the full sample, the estimated effect of US interventions on
the share of imports from the US is positive and statistically significant. Further, the estimated
magnitude is large. An intervention increases the share of imports that are from the US by 17.8
percent. This is much larger than the average increase for the full sample, which is 10.5 percent.
The effect of interventions on the share of exports to the US continues to be close to zero.
Democracies are defined as observations with a Polity score greater than zero in year t and
t − 1.13 Estimates of equations (1) and (2), with the sample restricted to democracies, are reported
in columns 3 and 6 of table 2. The results show that unlike our full sample of observations and our
subsample of autocracies, we cannot reject a zero relationship between US interventions and the

in year t and autocratic in t − 1, or vice versa. These observations are not included in either sample.

15

share of imports from the US.14 Therefore, consistent with the influence hypothesis, interventions
only have an effect on the share of imports from the US in regimes where the leader is less
accountable to its citizens and has more ability to choose policies freely.
To gain a better understanding of the increased share of imports from the US, we separately
examine the effect of interventions on imports from the US, and on total imports from all countries.
We re-estimate equations (1) and (2) with either log imports (from the US or the world), or log
exports (to the US or the world) as the dependent variable. Estimates are reported in table 3.
Columns 1–2 report estimates when the dependent variable is the natural log of imports from
the US, while in columns 3–4, the dependent variable is the natural log of total imports from all
countries. The results show that following an intervention there is an increase in the volume of
imports from the US and no change in total imports. Therefore, the increased share of imports
from the US arose from a shift away from imports from other countries’ towards imports from the
US. In other words, the increased share of imports from the US was a result of trade diversion, and
not trade creation. According to the estimates from columns 1–2, a US intervention increased the
volume of US imports in that year by 12.9% for the full sample, and 18.6% for autocracies. These
increases are similar to the shares estimates from table 2. Columns 5–8 report the estimated effects
of interventions on exports. The estimates provide no evidence that CIA interventions affected
exports to the US or to the world. These results are consistent with the findings from table 2.
To provide the reader with a better sense of the implied magnitudes of the estimates, we undertake two counterfactual exercises.15 For intervened countries, we can ask how different imports
from the US would have been absent any covert CIA interventions.16 Figure 4a reports, for Chile,
the actual and counterfactual value of log imports from the US in each year using the estimates
from column 1 of table 3.17 Following the CIA interventions, which began in 1964, counterfactual
and actual imports diverge significantly. By 1988, the final period of the CIA intervention episode,
actual imports from the US totaled 1.0 billion US dollars, while the counterfactual value of imports
is estimated to be only 574 million US dollars, just over half of the actual value.
14 This finding parallels the finding from Jones and Olken (2005) that leader deaths have larger macroeconomic effects

in autocracies than in democracies. As well, MacGillivray and Smith (2004) provide empirical evidence showing that
leadership turnover has little effect in democracies, but has a strong adverse effect on the volume of trade in autocracies.
15 Since we have not yet addressed the issue of causality, we take these counterfactuals as illustrative only. We consider
potential omitted factors and the selection of CIA interventions in the following section.
16 See Appendix B for the details behind the counterfactual calculations.
17 The vertical axis reports the natural log of Chilean imports from the US (measured in millions of nominal US
dollars).

Our second calculation quantifies the impact of CIA interventions from the US perspective. For
each intervened country, we first calculate its counterfactual imports from the US. We then construct a counterfactual measure of total US exports to all countries by aggregating each country’s
counterfactual imports from the US. The counterfactual measure of aggregate US exports, as well
as actual US exports, are reported in figure 4b. Although CIA interventions had a large impact on
trade flows from the perspective of intervened countries, the impact of interventions on US total
exports was not particularly large. In 1965, at the height of CIA activity, US exports totalled 25.1
billion dollars. According to the counterfactual calculations, without any covert CIA activities,
total US exports would have been 22.8 billion dollars.18

4. Causality: The Selection of Interventions
There are a number of reasons why one cannot take our estimates of β from equations (1) and (2)
as causal estimates of the effects of US influence on trade. Although our difference-in-difference
estimating equations, which include both country fixed effects and time period fixed effects,
control for country-specific time-invariant factors and time-specific country-invariant factors that
18 The 25.1 billion dollar figure for 1965 is slightly lower than the official figure reported by the U.S. Census Bureau
which is 26.5 billion. The difference can be explained by the fact that our total does not include trade with the Soviet
Union. It also omits trade with countries that are not included in the sample because of significant border changes. This
includes Bangladesh, Pakistan, Germany, Yugoslavia, Yemen, and Vietnam.

Notes : The unit of observation is a country c in year t, where t ranges from 1947 to 1989. All regressions include year fixed effects, country fixed effects, a Soviet intervention control,
two lags of the dependent variable, ln per capita income, ln total income, an indicator for leader turnover, current leader tenure, an indicator variable for GATT membership, an indicator

may potentially bias our estimates of interest, there remains the possibility of bias resulting from
omitted country- and time-varying factors. In our setting, the primary concern is that there may be
selection in the targeting of CIA interventions (e.g., Aidt and Albornoz, 2010). Of particular concern is the possibility that interventions may have been more likely when a country had recently
experienced a decline in its imports of US products. This is an example of the famous “Ashenfelter
dip”(Ashenfelter, 1978, Ashenfelter and Card, 1985). The presence of pre-intervention dips in US
imports will bias our estimated effects of interventions on US trade upwards.
We undertake a number of strategies to reduce potential bias that may arise from the endogeneity of interventions. Our first strategy controls for pre-trends in the dependent variable. By
doing this, we are hoping to capture the ‘dips’ in imports, which are a source of bias. Estimates
US
controlling for five-year pre-trends (i.e., ln mUS
t−1,c − ln mt−6,c ) are reported in the odd numbered

columns of table 4. In all specifications, the coefficients for US influence are statistically significant,
and the point estimates change little. The results are also similar if we use alternative intervals to
measure the pre-trends e.g., three-years windows. They are also similar whether or not we control
for the lagged dependent variables, which are correlated with the pre-trends.
Our second strategy is to include a pre-intervention fixed effect in the estimating equation.

Notes : The unit of observation is a country c in year t, where t ranges from 1947 to 1989. All regressions include year fixed effects, country fixed effects, a Soviet intervention control, two
lags of the dependent variable, ln per capita income, ln total income, an indicator for leader turnover, current leader tenure, an indicator variable for GATT membership, an indicator for signing
the NY convention, and Polity fixed effects. The odd numbered columns control for an indicator variable that equals one if period t is within 5 years before the onset of an intervention episode.
The even numbered columns include indicator variables that equals one if country c is at war with the US in period t , and if the US has placed a sanction against US exports to country c in
year t . Coefficients are reported with robust standard errors in brackets. ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1, 5 and 10% levels.

Specifically, we control for an indicator variable that equals one if the observation (country c in
period t) is between 1 and 5 years prior to an intervention. The fixed effects capture average differences (which may affect the dependent variable) that exist in the periods prior to an intervention.
Results controlling for a 5-year pre-intervention fixed effect are reported in the even numbered
columns of table 4. The results remain robust to this control.19
Our third strategy controls for the selection-bias that arises from the endogeneity of the onset of
interventions, rather than the endogeneity of all intervention periods. It may be that the beginning
of an intervention episode is the only decision that is affected by selection. To account for this
possibility, we control for an indicator variable that equals one if the observation is between 1 and
5 years prior to the onset of an intervention episode. This specification assumes that there was
selection in the decision to begin an intervention episode, but not in subsequent periods of an
intervention episode. Estimation results are reported in the odd numbered columns of table 5. The
results remain robust to this alternative control.
The final strategy we undertake is to control for variables that measure poor foreign relations
with the US. This is the most likely factor, affecting both affecting imports from the US and the

onset of CIA interventions. We measure poor relations using two indicator variables that capture
the existence of US sanctions and US warfare against foreign countries. The sanctions indicator
variable equals one if in period t, the US has placed an sanction against US exports to country c.
The war indicator variable equals one if the US is at war with country c in year t.20 As reported in
the even numbered columns of table 5, the results remain robust to these controls.

5. Robustness and Sensitivity Analysis
A. Robustness to Alternative Specifications
In the analysis, we have chosen to use a stringent and demanding specification that includes
country fixed effects, time period fixed effects, and lags of the dependent variable. It is well-known
that in specifications with fixed effects and lagged dependent variables, there is the potential for
a Nickell (1981) bias to affect the coefficients of interest. It is importance to recognize, however,
that this is a bias (not an inconsistency) that converges to zero as the total number of time periods
increases. The number of years included in our panel is much greater than the environments
that have typically been associated with the Nickel bias. To obtain a more concrete sense of the
magnitude of the bias in our panel, consider the formula for the bias originally derived by Nickell
(1981). For an equation without covariates the formula is given by plim N →∞ (γ̂ − γ) '

−(1+γ)
T −1 ,

where γ is the relationship between the dependent varable in period t and the dependent variable
in period t − 1. In our setting, T = 43 and γ̂ ≈ 0.56. Assume that γ = .60. Then, the bias is equal to
−(1+.60)
42

= −0.038. In addition, this is an upper bound, since the bias is strictly lower when there

are covariates.
We also test for the potential importance of the Nickell bias in our results by estimating alternative specifications that do not suffer from the bias. We estimate a specification that does not control
for country and time-period fixed effects, and only controls for lags of the dependent variable. We
also estimate standard difference-in-difference estimating equations without lags of the dependent
variable.21 We also estimate these regressions controlling for linear and non-linear country-specific
20 The

sanctions data are from Hufbauer, Schott, Elliott, and Oegg (2009), and the conflict data are from Barbieri,
Keshk, and Pollins (2008).
21 Angrist and Pischke (2009, p. 246) suggest that these two alternatives give bounds on the treatment effect, since the
lagged dependent variable specification estimates a treatment effect that is too small if the true model is fixed effects,
while fixed effect specification estimates a treatment effect that is too large if the true model is the lagged dependent
variable.

21

time trends. The results using these alternative specifications, which we do not report here for
brevity, are qualitatively identical to the estimates from our baseline equations.22
Our baseline estimating equations are derived from a log-linearization of the theoretically derived gravity model.23 One consequence of the log-linearization is that zero trade observations are
dropped from the sample. Although, the number of observations dropped for this reason is very
small (only 306 of 4,170 potential observations), we check that our omission of these observations
is not significantly affecting our results. We pursue two strategies to assess the importance of the
omission of zero trade flows from our analysis. The first is to re-estimate equation (1) with the share
of imports from the US, rather than the log share of imports from the US, as the dependent variable.
The second is to use the Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood (PPML) estimator suggested by
Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006). Because PPML does not use a log-linearized estimating equation,
all observations are used, even ones with zero trade. We find that these alternative specifications
yield results that are very similar to the baseline estimates.

B. Robustness to Alternative Intervention Measures
A potential concern is measurement error in our CIA intervention variable. One source of error
arises from the fact that our data are measured at annual frequencies, while in reality CIA activities
occurred in continuous time. This results in some imprecision when coding US influencet,c . For
example, in the case of Chile, since Salvador Allende won the election on September 4, 1970, it
is unclear whether to code US influencet,c as one or zero for Chile in 1970. The rule we follow in
constructing our baseline measure is to include the years of the onset and offset of interventions as
being an intervention year. Therefore, since 1970 is an offset year of the CIA’s support of Eduardo
Frei, it is coded as one. We have checked that none of our results depend on this decision. Choosing
instead to code onset- and offset-intervention years as zero yields results that are virtually identical
to what we report here.
We have also conducted a number of robustness checks for alternative plausible codings of our
intervention variable. For eleven interventions, a case could be made for coding the intervention
as a non-intervention, and for two non-interventions a case could be made for coding the nonintervention as an intervention. A full description of these observations is provided in the online

of this are provided in Appendix A.

data appendix. We test the robustness of our findings to these observations and find that our
results are robust to all plausible and internally consistent alternative codings.
We also test the robustness of our estimates to an alternative, more narrow measure of CIA
interventions. Unlike our baseline variable US influencet,c , the alternative measure only takes on the
value of one if at the beginning of the CIA intervention episode, a new leader was installed by the
CIA. This definition excludes interventions where the CIA began to support a leader that was not
installed by the CIA. Using this alternative measure yields estimates that are qualitatively identical
to the results using the baseline intervention measure. We continue to find that interventions
increase the share of imports from the US, the effect is larger for autocracies, and interventions
have no effect on the share of a country’s exports to the US. The magnitudes of the coefficient
estimates are also similar to the baseline estimates.

C. Estimates using all Bilateral Country-Pairs
In our baseline estimating equations, the unit of observation is a country in a year, and the
dependent variable is a measure of the country’s trade with the US – either the log of the share
of imports from the US or the log of the value of imports from the US. An alternative strategy is to
examine trade between all countries, not just trade between all countries and the US. Testing for
the importance of CIA interventions in this setting results in the following estimating equation:
ln mt,c,e = αt + αc,e + β 1 US influencet,c + β 2 US influencet,c × IeUS
N

+ γn

∑ ln mt−n,c,e + Xt,c Γ + Xt,e Ω + ε t,c,e

(3)

n =1

where, as before, t indexes years, c now indexes importers, and e indexes exporters. The dependent
variable is the natural log of imports shipped by country e into country c in year t. The equation
controls for time period fixed effects αt , and country-pair fixed effects αc,e , which absorb standard
gravity controls, like bilateral distance, common language, a common legal origin, a contiguous
border, etc. As before, the equation also includes lags of the dependent variable, and importer
covariates, Xt,c . It also includes exporter covariates, Xt,e .
As in equation (1), we include US influencet,c , which equals one if the importing country c
experienced a CIA intervention in year t. Because we now include all country-pairs in the sample,
we allow the effect of an interventions on imports to differ depending on whether the imports are
from the US or not. We allow for this differential effect by also including US influencet,c × IeUS in

Estimation results are reported in table 6. Columns 1–4 report estimates of equation (3) and
columns 5–8 report estimates of (4). The odd numbered columns include all countries in the
sample, while the even numbered columns only include autocratic importers (in columns 2 and 4)
or autocratic exporters (in columns 6 and 8). In columns 1, 2, 5 and 6 the dependent variable is the
natural log of the value of trade, while in 3, 4, 7 and 8, the dependent variable is the natural log
of the world trade share. Estimates of equations (3) and (4) provide results that are qualitatively
identical to the baseline estimates. Although US interventions did not increase in imports from
non-US countries, they did cause a significant increase in imports from the US. The effects are

24

more pronounced if we restrict the sample to autocratic importers. The estimates also show that
interventions did not have an effect on exports to the US or other countries.

6. Testing Alternative Explanations
A. Trade Costs Explanation
To this point, we have documented a robust relationship between CIA interventions and increased
imports from the US. We have interpreted this as evidence of the effect of US influence, gained
through covert CIA interventions, on the sale of US products in the intervened country. An
alternative explanation for the increase in foreign-country imports from the US is a decrease in
bilateral trading costs between the US and the intervened country. To distinguish between these
two mechanisms, we move to the industry level and examine which industries experienced the
greatest surge in imports from the US following an intervention. If the increase in imports from
the US arose because of a decrease in trading costs between the foreign country and the US, then
the increase in shipments from the US should have been in industries in which the US had a
comparative advantage. With a movement towards free trade, countries increasingly export the
goods that they have a relative cost advantage in producing and import the goods they have a
relative disadvantage in producing. This logic of comparative advantage is central to standard
models of international trade ranging from the textbook Ricardian or Heckscher-Ohlin models
of trade to more recent models of comparative advantage with firm heterogeneity (e.g., Bernard,
Redding, and Schott, 2007).
Testing this prediction of the trade costs explanation requires a measure of US competitiveness
across industries and time periods. For this we use Balassa’s (1965) measure of revealed comparative advantage (RCA). The measure, which captures the degree of specialization of a country in a
particular industry, is given by:
RCAt,c,i =

xt,c,i . ∑i xt,c,i
∑c xt,c,i ∑i ∑c xt,c,i

where xt,c,i denotes the aggregate exports of country c in industry i and year t. The RCA measure is
a ratio of two ratios. The first ratio, the numerator, is country c’s share of world exports in industry
i. The second ratio, the denominator, is country c’s share of world exports in all industries. That is,
RCA compares the country’s share of global exports in industry i to the share for all industries. If
the ratio is above one, then the country captures a greater share of global exports in industry i than

it does on average. This is then taken as an indicator that the country has a comparative advantage
in producing in industry i. If the ratio is less than one, then the country captures less of the world
export share in industry i than it does on average.
To provide a reader with a sense of the constructed RCA measures, table 7 reports the RCA
measure for the US in 1962 for all 2-digit SITC (Standard International Trade Classification) industries. Overall, the measures are consistent with intuition. The US has low relative export shares in
low-end manufacturing industries like beverages, footwear, and textiles, and high export shares in
high-end industries like transport equipment, scientific equipment, chemicals, and firearms.
We use the RCA measures to test whether following an intervention the increase in imports
was greatest in the industries in which the US had a comparative advantage. We test this with the
following estimating equation:
ln mUS
t,c,i = αt + αc + αi + β 1 US influencet,c + β 2 US influencet,c × US RCAt,i
26

+ β 3 US influencet,c × Importer RCAt,c,i + β 4 US RCAt,i + β 5 Importer RCAt,c,i

+

∑ γn ln mUS
t−n,c,i + Xt,c Γ + ε t,c,i

(5)

n =1

In equation (5) the unit of observation is a year t, a country c, and an industry i. The dependent
variable is the natural log of imports into country c in industry i from the United States. The
regression includes year fixed effects, country fixed effects, and industry fixed effects, as well
as the full set of covariates. As before, US influencet,c is our measure of CIA interventions. We
now allow the effect of an intervention to differ across industries depending on whether the
importing country has a comparative advantage in industry i and depending on whether the US
has a comparative advantage in industry i. The variables Importer RCAt,c,i and US RCAt,i measure
each country’s comparative advantage in the production of good i in year t.24 If the increase in
imports is from a decrease in transactions costs, then we expect β 2 > 0. The increase in US imports
should have been greater in industries in which the US had a comparative advantage. As predicted
by standard models of international trade, increased integration should have caused countries to
specialize in (and export more of) the products that they were relatively good at producing.
If the increase in trade did not arise because of comparative advantage, then we no longer
expect β 2 > 0. There is no reason to expect the increase to necessarily be greater in industries in
which the US had a comparative advantage. Instead, the US may have pushed to sell goods which
it was only marginally competitive in producing, and otherwise would have had difficulty selling.
In this case we expect β 2 ≤ 0. Therefore, the estimated coefficient for β 2 provides a test between
the trade costs and influence explanations.
Estimates of equation (5) are reported in table 8. Columns 1–6 report estimates for the full
sample, while columns 7–12 report estimates for autocracies only. To be as conservative as possible,
we cluster all standard errors at the country-year level. We also report estimates with industries
defined by the 2-digit, 3-digit and 4-digit SITC classifications. In all specifications, the estimated
coefficients for US influence × US RCA is negative and statistically significant, indicating that interventions increased imports more in industries in which the US had a comparative disadvantage,
not comparative advantage in producing. This finding is in contrast to what is expected if the
24 To allow an easy interpretation of the magnitudes of the estimated effects, we have normalized US RCA and
t,i
Importer RCAt,c,i to lie between zero and one by subtracting the minimum value of the variable and then dividing by the
maximum value.

increase in trade were from a decrease in bilateral trading costs between the US and the intervened
country.25
A potential criticism of the RCA measure is that it does not distinguish between a country’s
exports to developed countries (DCs) and its exports to less developed countries (LDCs). If the
two groups of countries represent different markets, then the US may specialize either in products
to serve the LDC markets or products to serve DCs. Since the market size of LDCs is much smaller
than of DCs, when the US serves the LDC market, its share of total world exports may be low, and
therefore its measure of RCA is also low. If interventions decreased bilateral trade costs between
the US and the intervened LDC, then this may have caused greater specialization in the export of
LDC products, and as a result, imports from the US increased most in industries with low measures
of US RCA.
According to this explanation, the failure of the test results because we are incorrectly measuring RCA. Rather than measuring US RCA for exports to the entire world, we should be constructing a measure of RCA based on US exports to LDCs only. We check for this possibility by
25 The

total effect of US influence on imports from the US is given by β 1 + β 2 US RCAt,i + β 3 Importer RCAt,c,i . Examining this, we find that for nearly all observations (countries, years, and industries), the total effect of US influence is
greater than or equal to zero. That is, CIA interventions had a non-negative effect on the purchase of US products in
nearly every industry, and the effects were greatest in industries in which the US was globally least competitive.

28

constructing alternative measures of RCA that are calculated using only the share of exports to
LDCs rather than the share of exports globally.26 Because of space constraints we do not report
the estimates here. However, we find that the results are nearly identical using this alternative
measure of RCA. In all specifications the coefficient for US influencet,c × US RCAt,i is negative and
statistically significant, and the magnitudes are close to those reported in table 8.
Overall, the results provide evidence against the hypothesis that the increase in US imports
following an intervention was the result of a decrease in trade costs between the US and the
intervened country.
B. Political Ideology Explanation
It is possible that countries prefer to import goods from countries with political ideologies more
aligned to their own.27 If this is the case, then the increase in imports from the US may be explained
by a change in the ideology of the intervened country following an intervention. Under this
explanation, the increase in imports from the US arises not because of US influence, but because
the new regime has an ideology that is more aligned with the US. Imports from all ideologically
similar countries increased, and the US just happens to be one of these countries.
To test this possibility, we use voting information from the UN general assembly to construct
a measure of the similarity of countries’ ideologies and preferences. We take the voting position
of the US as a references point. Define dt,c to be the sum of the vote distance between country c
and the US for all votes in year t, where a vote in opposition to the US is given a distance of 1,
and a vote with the US is given a distance of 0.28 Also define dmax

increased following CIA interventions. If the ideology explanation is correct, then we expect β 3 to
be positive and significant. We are also interested in how the estimated impact of interventions on

imports from the US, β 2 , is affected when we control for US influencet,c × Vt,e

Estimation results are reported in the first four columns of table 9. The estimates of β 2 remain
robust to the inclusion of the new interaction term. They remain positive and significant, and their
magnitudes barely change.29 The estimates also show that following an intervention, imports from
countries ideologically close to the US did not increase.
The remaining columns of table 9 report results using an alternative measure of country e’s
US with an indicator
alignment with the US. Rather than using UN voting data, we measure Vt,e

variable that equals one if country e was an original 1949 member of NATO. The results are similar
using the alternative measure. There is no increase in imports from non-US NATO countries
following CIA interventions, and the estimated effect of CIA interventions on foreign-country
imports from the US remains robust.
Overall, the data do not support the hypothesis that the increase in US imports arose because
the newly installed leaders were more pro-Western or pro-Capitalist. The increase in imports was
US specific, and there was no increase in imports from countries that were ideologically similar to
the US.
29 The coefficients in columns 1–4 of table 9 can be compared to columns 1–4 of table 6. The only difference between
US and US influence × V US , is a slightly different number of observations

C. US Loans and Grants Explanation
If interventions were followed by an increase in US foreign aid, particularly tied or conditional aid,
then this may be an alternative explanation for why interventions increased imports from the US.30
To examine this empirically, we use data on the value of US foreign aid received by each country.31
The aid data are disaggregated into economic aid (which includes grants and concessional loans),
military aid (which includes grants, concessional loans, and training), and food aid. As a test of
whether the increase in US imports is explained by an increase in US foreign aid, we check whether
US foreign aid increased following CIA interventions, and if the changes in aid are able to account
for the increase in US imports that followed CIA interventions.
The results are reported in table 10, which reports estimates of our baseline estimating equation
(1), but with measures of US loans and grants as the dependent variable. Columns 1 and 5 report
estimates when the dependent variable is the natural log of the dollar value of US economic aid
30 The fact that US imports increased most in low US RCA industries suggests that if this explanation is correct, then
the provision of grants and loans were used to promote US sales in industries in which US firms were less competitive.
This would also be an interesting and important finding.
31 The data are from the U.S. Agency for International Development’s (USAID) U.S. Overseas Loans and Grants, Obligations and Loan Authorizations annual report, also known simply as the “Green Book”.

provided to country c in year t. Columns 2 and 6 report results for military aid, and columns 3 and
7 report results for food aid. The results show that all forms of US aid tended to increase following
CIA interventions. We also examine loans given by the US Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank). The
mandate of the Bank is to provide loans to foreign firms wanting to import US products. Because
the Bank only provides loans that would not be provided by private lenders, they enable foreign
customers to purchase US goods, thereby increasing US exports. Columns 4 and 8 of table 10 show
that Ex-Im Bank loans also increased following CIA interventions.
Table 11 reports estimates that test whether the increase in foreign aid is able to account for the
increase in US imports following an intervention. We do this by estimating (1) while controlling
for the amount of US loans and grants received by a country in a year. Our baseline estimates
without additional controls are reported in columns 1 and 6. In columns 2 and 7, we include
the measures of economic and military aid. Economic aid enters with positive and significant
coefficients, while military aid enters with positive, but insignificant coefficients. This suggests
that part of US economic aid is used to purchase US products, which is unsurprising considering
that US economic aid is often tied to purchases from US producers. The insignificant coefficient for
military aid is not surprising, since much of military aid goes to supporting overseas US personnel,
and these goods are not included in IMF DOT statistics (International Monetary Fund, 1993).
Columns 3 and 8 control for food aid, and columns 4 and 9 control for Ex-Im Bank loans. Both

variables enter with positive and significant coefficients.
Lastly, in the columns 5 and 9, we simultaneously control for all measures of US loans and
grants. Controlling for the variables together has the largest impact on the estimated coefficient for
US influence. However, the size of the declines is modest. The coefficient magnitudes are reduced
by about 20% for both the full sample and the subsample of autocracies. The results suggest that
although increases in US loans and grants are able to explain some of the effect of interventions
on imports from the US, it is a modest proportion of the total. This is consistent with the fact
that foreign aid flows are not large enough to account for the observed increase in imports from
the US. The ratio of US total aid to US imports is 0.15 for the median observation in the sample.
Therefore, even if an intervention-induced increase in US aid was transformed one-for-one into
imports (which in reality is far from true), a CIA intervention would need to increase aid by 127%
to increase imports by 19% (127% × 0.15 = 19%), which is the estimated impact of an intervention
from column 2 of table 3. The estimated effects of interventions on US aid found in columns 5–8 of

33

table 10 are much lower than this, ranging instead from 40 to 65%.32

7. Underlying Mechanisms
In this section, we examine evidence for the mechanisms underlying the increase in imports from
the US following CIA interventions. There are a number of ways in which US influence could be
used to increase the foreign sale of US products. First, the foreign government could be influenced
to directly purchase US products. Second, the government could be influenced to alter domestic
policies, which create an incentive for individuals to purchase more US products. One such
policy is regulations against foreign direct investment (FDI). If US influence was used to allow
greater foreign investment in the intervened country, particularly US investment, then this may
have translated into greater imports of US products, since US-owned firms tend to import more
from the US. The other policy is tariffs and other trade barriers. If following an intervention,
tariffs were reduced, particularly tariffs that protected against competition from US producers,
then this could have resulted in increased imports from the US. We consider each of these three
mechanisms. As we show below, we find evidence that the full effect can be explained by an
increase in foreign-government purchases of US products. We do not find evidence that US FDI or
tariffs play a role.
It is well-established that government purchases are highly discriminatory, with producers chosen based on a number of other criterion besides lowest costs (see e.g., Baldwin, 1970, Lowinger,
1976, Audet, 2002). As a share of GDP, government purchases have typically been around 20
percent of GDP for industrialized nations and 15 percent for developing nations (Baldwin, 1970,
p. 58, Audet, 2002). Included in these purchases are compensation to employees. Removing these,
and focusing only on purchases of goods, the figures become 10.3 and 8.8 percent, respectively
(Audet, 2002). These figures can be compared to the predicted intervention-induced increase in
imports based on our estimates. According to the estimates from column 1 of table 3, the average
observation in the sample experienced an increase in US imports equal to 8.5 percent of GDP. (For
the median observation, the figure is 7.7 percent.) Therefore, from a purely quantitative standpoint,
32 An explanation, similar to the US loans and grants explanation, is that the US may have sold goods at a discount to
intervened countries. If the demand for US products was sufficiently elastic, then this could explain the increase in the
total value of US imports. Using unit value data from Feenstra (1997), we have examined the prices of imports from the
US, and find that they are not affected by CIA interventions.

Notes: The unit of observation is a country c in year t , where t ranges from 1947 to 1989. All regressions include year fixed effects, country fixed effects, a Soviet intervention control,
two lags of the dependent variable, ln per capita income, ln total income, government expenditure share, an indicator for leader turnover, current leader tenure, an indicator variable for
GATT membership, an indicator variable for signing the NY convention, and Polity fixed effects. Coefficients are reported with robust standard errors in brackets. ***, **, and * indicate

the purchase of goods by governments is large enough to potentially account for the observed
increase in imports from the US following a CIA intervention.
We explicitly test for this mechanism by examining whether the estimated impact of CIA interventions on imports from the US is stronger in countries where the government controls a greater
share of the economy, which we measure using the share of government expenditures in GDP,
taken from the Penn World Tables Mark 6.2. Estimation results are reported in table 12. Because
data on government expenditure share are unavailable for all countries, and are only available
from 1950 onwards, the sample size is reduced to 3,339 observations in the full sample, and 1,919
observations in the subsample of autocracies. The odd numbered columns of the table reproduce
the baseline estimates with the smaller sample sizes. The even numbered columns report estimates
that allow the effect of CIA interventions to differ depending on the government’s share of GDP.
As shown, the interaction between US influence and the government expenditure share is positive
and statistically significant in every specification.
To get a sense of the magnitude of the heterogeneity, first note that the government expenditure
share ranges from .03 (i.e., 3%) to .73, and has a mean value of .21. Consider the estimation results
for the full sample with the log of the US import share as the dependent variable (reported in
columns 1 and 2). For the mean observation in the sample, the estimated effect of CIA interventions
on the share of imports from the US is −.067 + .21 × .971 = .137. This is very close to the
35

estimated coefficient of .128 from column 1, where the effect is constrained to be the same for
all observations. For the observation with the lowest government share, the estimated effect is

−.067 + .03 × .971 = −.038, which is not statistically different from zero. For the observation with
the highest government share, the estimated effect is −.067 + .73 × .971 = .642. Therefore, there is
substantial heterogeneity in the effects of CIA interventions. The effect of an intervention ranges
from essentially zero to an increase of 64 percent.
The coefficient for US influence is also of interest. It provides the estimated effect of US interventions for a hypothetical country with zero government expenditure. The coefficient reports the
estimated effect of interventions after shutting down the channel that works through the government. Although this interpretation relies strongly on the structural form of the estimating equation,
it is still informative. In all four estimates, the estimated coefficient is not statistically different from
zero, suggesting that there is no additional effects of interventions other than through government
expenditures.
Overall, the estimates of table 12 indicate that a large portion, and possibly all, of the effect of
CIA interventions worked through foreign government purchases. We now turn to the possibility
that the effects of US interventions worked through tariffs or FDI. Using data from the BEA we
examine whether interventions were followed by increases in US FDI in the intervened country.
The estimates, using a number of different measures of outward US FDI, are reported in table 13.
Although five of the six specifications report a positive coefficient for US interventions, none of the
coefficients are statistically significant. This provides weak or no support for the notion that CIA
interventions result in a subsequent increase in US FDI.
An ideal test of the tariff channel would rely on annual industry-level ad valorem tariffs for
all countries. Unfortunately, these data are decades from being constructed. Instead, we pursue
an alternative strategy using information from the International Customs Journal published by the
International Customs Tariff Bureau (BITD). The BITD, which was established in 1890, translates
and publishes countries’ tariff schedules on a continuous basis. When a country significantly
changes its tariff structure, a new ‘volume’ is published for the country. If minor changes to the
tariff structure are made, then a ‘supplement’ to the most recent volume is published. We take the
publication of a new volume as an indicator of a significant change in a country’s tariff structure.
Using this information, we examine whether US interventions had a greater impact on US

imports after a revision to the intervened-country’s tariff schedule. If interventions affected US
imports through tariff changes, then we should observe that during an intervention episode, the
greatest effects occur in the years after the tariffs were altered. We check for this by constructing
a variable that equals one for intervention years that follow a change in the tariff structure that
occurred during the intervention episode, where an intervention episode is defined as continuous
years of intervention.
The variable can be illustrated by returning to the example of Chile. Consider the intervention
episode, lasting from 1964 to 1970, when Eduardo Frei was backed by the CIA. The first change
in the tariff structure during this period was in 1967. Therefore, the new variable takes on the
value of one from 1967 to 1970. These are the years during the intervention episode that followed
a restructuring of industry tariffs.
The estimates are reported in table 14. Columns 1 and 4 first estimate whether US interventions
increased the probability of a change in the tariff structure.33 The estimates provide no evidence
of this. The remaining columns in the table report estimates of our baseline estimating equations
including the new post-tariff change intervention variable. The estimates show no evidence that
within intervention episodes, the periods after a tariff change experienced a greater increase in US
33 We

estimate a linear probability model. Logit and Probit models provide qualitatively identical estimates.

imports. In none of the specifications is the post-tariff change intervention variable positive.

A. Additional Evidence from Timing
The evidence reported to this point suggests that most, if not all, of the increase in foreign-country
imports from the US arose through government purchases, and not through government policies
that affected tariffs or FDI. In this section, we undertake an additional test, based on the timing of
the effects of interventions, which allows us to further assess these findings. Among the channels
we have considered, government procurement of foreign products can respond most quickly to
US influence. Foreign governments can immediately switch to the purchase of US products. Other
mechanisms, like tariffs and FDI, require a change in government policies, and this takes time.
Further, these mechanisms also require that private actors in the economy respond to the changed
policies, which also takes time. Therefore, the speed at which interventions cause an increase in
imports from the US provides evidence about the underlying causal mechanism. If US influence
immediately increased imports from the US, then this is added evidence for the government
procurement channel.
We undertake two strategies to examine timing. The first is to disaggregate US influence into

Notes : The unit of observation is a country c in year t, where t ranges from 1947 to 1989. All regressions include year fixed effects, country fixed effects, a Soviet intervention
control, two lags of the dependent variable, ln per capita income, ln total income, an indicator for leader turnover, current leader tenure, an indicator variable for GATT
membership, an indicator for signing the NY convention, and Polity fixed effects. The odd numbered columns control for an indicator variable that equals one if period t is within
5 years before the onset of an intervention episode. The even numbered columns include indicator variables that equals one if country c is at war with the US in period t , and if the
US has placed a sanction against US exports to country c in year t . Coefficients are reported with robust standard errors in brackets. ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1, 5

three variables. The first is an indicator variable that equals one in the first year of an intervention
episode, US influence (onset year). The second is an indicator for the last year of the episode,
US influence (offset year). The third is an indicator for interventions in the years between the onset
and offset years, US influence (intermediate year). We include the three variables in the estimating
equations rather than US influence. By doing this, we are able to identify which interventions have
the largest effects on trade. The results are reported in the odd numbered columns of table 15. The
estimates suggest that interventions, even in their first year, have large effects. In other words, US
influence immediately causes an increased purchase of US products. Moreover, the effect of the
interventions does not appear to change over the tenure of the intervention episode. In all four
specifications, standard F-tests cannot reject the null hypothesis that the coefficients for the three
intervention variables are equal.
The second strategy we employ allows the effect of US influence to differ depending on the
number of previous consecutive periods of intervention years experienced by the country. This
tests explicitly whether, during an intervention episode, a year of intervention begins to have a
39

stronger or weaker impact on trade over time. In practice, we interact US influence with how many
years into the intervention episode period t is, and with this measure squared (this allows the
differential effect to be non-linear).34 The results are reported in the even numbered columns of
table 15. Again, there is no evidence of a differential effect of an intervention depending on the
number of previous intervention years.

8. Conclusions
Our analysis has provided evidence that increased political influence, arising from CIA interventions during the Cold War, was used by the US to create a larger foreign market for its products. We
show that following CIA interventions, foreign-country imports from the US increased dramatically. Further, the increase was greatest in industries in which the US was the least competitive in
producing, and there was no similar increase in US purchases of intervened-country exports.
The empirical analysis first addressed the issue of causality by explicitly correcting for the
potential endogeneity of CIA interventions. We did this by controlling for pre-trends in the
dependent variable, pre-intervention fixed effects, and for observable factors potentially correlated
with the onset of CIA interventions and trade flows.
We then turned to alternative explanations for the increase in imports from the US. We showed
that the surge in US imports cannot be explained by decreased trade costs. A testable implication
of the trade costs explanation is that the increase in US imports should have been concentrated in
industries in which the US had a comparative advantage. We showed that instead, the increase
was greatest in industries in which the US had a comparative disadvantage. We then tested the
hypothesis that the increase in US imports arose because the newly installed leaders were more ideologically aligned with the US, being more pro-capitalist and more pro-Western. The US-specific
increase in imports that we identify may have been part of a more general increase in imports from
all countries that were more ideologically aligned with the new regime. We showed that the data
do not support this explanation. We observe no increase in imports from non-US countries with
similar ideologies, measured using either voting behavior in the UN general assembly or NATO
membership. The last alternative explanation we considered was that the increase in US imports
arose because the US provided more loans and grants to the new regime. This would have enabled,
and encouraged, intervened countries to import more US products. We tested for this and found
34 We

reach the same conclusion if we restrict the interaction to be linear.

40

that although loans and grants, measured by economic aid, military aid, food aid, and Ex-Im Bank
loans, did increase following an intervention, they 4are only able to account for, at most, 20% of
the observed increase in imports from the US.
We then turned to the channels underlying the relationship between CIA interventions and
imports from the US. We provided evidence that most, and possibly all, of the effect arose through
government purchases. Following CIA interventions, the government was influenced to directly
purchase US products, and this influence was greatest for products in which US producers were
uncompetitive in producing.

Appendix A. Relationship Between the Theoretically Derived Gravity Model and the
Estimating Equations
This section explicitly derives the relationship between our estimating equations and the theoretically derived gravity model from Anderson and van Wincoop (2003). Consider the equation for the
theoretically derived gravity model with symmetric trade costs (e.g., Anderson and van Wincoop,
2003):
mt,c,e



Yt,c Yt,e
=
YtW

τt,c,e
Pt,c Pt,e

1− σ
(A 1)

where mt,c,e denotes imports into country c from exporter e in year t. Yt,c is total GDP of the
importing country c in year t, Yt,e is total GDP of the exporting country e in year t, and YtW is world
GDP in year t. The parameter σ is the elasticity of substitution between all goods. τt,c,e measures
bilateral trade related costs when shipping goods from e to c, and Pt,c and Pt,e are multilateral
resistance terms for countries c and e, respectively. These are complex non-linear functions of the
full set of bilateral cost terms {τt,c,e }. See equation (12) of Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) for
derivation and a general discussion.
Our estimating equations can be derived from equation (A 1). First consider equation (1) where
the dependent variable is imports from the US into country c in year t. Let YtUS denote US income,
US denote trade frictions between the

US and country c. Then country c’s imports in year t that are from the US is given by:

affects trade frictions between c and the US, but also frictions between country c and other (nonUS) exporters e. US interventions, for example, affected the “costs” of a country’s trade with the
Soviet Union, communist or socialist countries, and even neutral countries. As a result, we are not

Given that we are not interested in estimating the structural parameter τt,c

to worry about separately identifying the parameter from the multilateral resistance term as in
Anderson and van Wincoop (2003). Therefore, our estimating equation does not control explicitly
for the multilateral resistance term.
Next consider equation (1) (where the dependent variable is the natural log of the share of total
imports that are from the US). To see the relationship with equation (A 1), first note that world
imports are given by:

Again, because we are uninterested in identifying the effect of

CIA interventions on the structural parameters, {τt,c,e }, our estimating equations do not separately
control for the multilateral resistance terms of Anderson and van Wincoop (2003). Instead, we
estimate the full reduced form effect of CIA interventions on trade with the US.

Appendix B. Calculating Counterfactual Trade Flows
Recall that γ1 and γ2 are coefficients for the one- and two-year lags of the dependent variables, and
β is the coefficient for US influence. Counterfactual measures are denoted by an overline. We use
the following to construct counterfactual imports from the US had no interventions taken place,
ln mUS
t,c :
US
US
US
US
US
ln mUS
t,c = ln mt,c − β US influence − γ1 (ln mt−1,c − ln mt−1,c ) − γ2 (ln mt−2,c − ln mt−2,c )

(A 5)

The first term subtracted from ln mUS
t,c is the adjusted to actual trade flows for the direct effect of an
intervention in period t on imports from the US in the same period. The second term adjusts for
the persistent effect of an intervention in period t − 1 on imports in period t. This works through
the impact that lagged trade has on current trade. The third term is the adjustment for the effect of
intervention in period t − 2 on trade in period t.
The calculations are made recursively beginning in 1947, the first period of the sample. For
these observations the last two terms of (A 5) are equal to zero. The calculations are then made for
1948, which use the calculated counterfactual trade flows from 1947. In 1948 the second term in
(A 5) is non-zero, while the third term is zero. The 1949 calculation uses the counterfactual trade
flows from 1947 and 1948. The procedure is continued until the final year 1989.

Appendix C. Data Appendix
We use trade data from two different sources. When we are only concerned with total value of
annual bilateral trade across all industries, we use trade data from the Correlates of War (COW)
Project (Barbieri et al., 2008), which reports aggregate bilateral trade flows (measured in millions
of nominal US dollars) annually between 1870 and 2006. The data are originally from the International Monetary Fund’s Direction of Trade Statistics. Data on trade flows at the industry level
are taken from the United Nations’ Comtrade Database. Unlike the aggregate-level COW trade
data, the Comtrade data only begin in 1962. Our industry-level analysis therefore only examines
interventions between 1962 to 1989.
Data on real per capita income and aggregate GDP are from Maddison (2003). The figures are
given in 1990 International Geary-Khamis dollars. The controls for leadership turnover and leadership tenure are from Bueno de Mesquita, Smith, Siverson, and Morrow (2004). Our democracy
fixed effects are constructed from the revised Polity2 measure from the Polity IV Database. The
variable is a composite measure that is increasing in the extent of institutionalized democracy in a
regime. The measure ranges from −10 (strongly autocratic) to +10 (strongly democratic).
