Some Ristorical Evidence 1370—1933
on the Impact and International
Transmission of Financial Crises

ABSTRACT

This study presents historical evidence for six countries (the U.S.
U.K., Germany, France, Canada, Sweden) in the period 1870—1933 on the impact
of financial crises on economic activity and on the international
transmission of financial crises. The paper examines two approaches in the
literature to the role and importance of financial crises as disturbances to
domestic and international economic activity, that of the
monetarists——Friedman and Schwartz and Cagan, and that of Fisher—Minsky and
Kindleberger.
In a comparison of reference cycle contractions for the six
countries over the period 1870—1933 severe contractions in economic activity
were in all cases accompanied by monetary contraction, in most cases with
stock market crashes, bat not with the exception of the U.S., by banking
crises. The unique performance of the U.S. can be attributed to the absence
of a nationwide branch banking system compared to the five other countries
examined, and the less effective role played by the U.S. monetary authorities
in acting as a lender of last resort.
Our principal findings on the international transmission of financial crises are two. First, consistent with the monetarist approach, that
under the Classical gold standard, in periods containing financial crises,
nations' money supplies were linked by gold flows and changes in high powered
money, while under periods of flexible exchange rates there is evidence of
insulation of domestic monetary and real variables from foreign shocks.
Second, in sympathy with the Kindleberger—Minsky approach, the
similarity between countries of turning points in stock market prices, the
common incidence of stock market crises, and the similar importance of the
deposit reserve ratio as the key determinant of monetary contraction in all
countries (except the u.s.) suggests that arbitrage in stock prices was a
channel for the international transmission of crises.

Some Historical Evidence (1870-1933) on the Impact and International
Transmission of Financial Crises*

1 .

INTRODUCTION

Recent fears of insolvency of major U.S. banks and the threat posed to
world economic stability has raised considerable interest in the topic of

financial crises and in financial crises of the past.1 This study presents
historical evidence for six countries in the period 1870—1933 on the impact
of financial crises on economic activity and on the international transmission
of financial crises.

Two approaches to financial crises predominate in the literature.2 The
nonetarist approach of Friedman and Schwartz (1963), Cagan (1965) and Schwartz
(1985) identifies financial crises with banking panics viewing them as either

producing or aggravating the effects of monetary contraction. The second
approach identified with the work of Minsky and Kindleberger, following the
seminal work of Fisher (1932), views financial crises as a key element of
the upper turning point in the business cycle and as the inevitable consequence
of the boom.

Many financial crises in the past two hundred years have occurred world
wide (see Kindleberger, 1978) although they have differed markedly in degree

of severity. Monetary and real channels have been emphasized in the two approaches
to international transmission.

According to the monetarist approach, financial crises (and also business
fluctuations) are transmitted internationally primarily through the monetary

standard.3 Under a fixed exchange rate, such as the classical gold standard,
a financial crisis in one count'y by reducing the money supply or velocity

in that country will attract gold flows from other countries. These countries

2

will in turn suffer a contraction in their money supplies and a reduction

in economic activity. Transmission can also occur through short—tern capital
flows, changes in real income, and commodity arbitrage, but the way in which

these channels affect activity is primarily through monetary change. By contrast,
under flexible exchange rates, according to the monetarist approach, one would
expect the transmission of financial disturbances to be considerably muted.

According to the Kindleberger-Minsky approach financial crises are
transmitted primarily through nonmonetary channels such as link portfolios
of financial institutions, capital flows, commodity arbitrage, and changes
in the balance of trade. Monetary factors are treated as of secondary importance.
In some detail Section 2 examines these two approaches to the role and
importance of financial crises as disturbances to domestic and international

economic activity. The two approaches can in some sense be treated as complements
rather than substitutes. Both emphasize the role of monetary and nonmonetary
factors in precipitating and transmitting crises, with different weights placed.

by each approaches on each set of factors. In what follows we do not run
a race between the two views but rather ascertain the extent to which historical
evidence is compatible with elements of each of them.

Section 3 examines the evidence for six countries: the United States,
Great Britain, France, Germany, Sweden and Canada on the relationship between
monetary contraction, the sources of monetary change, declines in economic activity
and the incidence of financial crises.

In a comparison of reference cycle

contractions for the six countries over the period 1870-1933 severe contractions
in economic activity were in all cases accompanied by monetary contraction,

3

in most cases with stock market crashes, but not with the exception of the

U. S., by banking crises. The unique performance of the U.S. can be attributed
to the absence of a nationwide branch banking system compared to the five
other countries examined, and the less effective role played by the U.S. monetary
authorities in acting as a lender of last resort.
Section 4 examines the evidence for the six countries on the international

transmission of financial crises. Our principal findings are two. First,
consistent with the rnonetarist approach, that under the Classical gold standard,

in periods containing financial crises, nations' money supplies were linked
by gold flows and changes in high powered money, while under periods of flexible
exchange rates there is evidence of insulation of domestic monetary and real
variables from foreign shocks.
Second in sympathy with the Kindleberger—Minsky approach, the similarity
between countries of turning points in stock market prices, the common incidence

of stock market crises, and the similar importance of the deposit reserve
ratio as the key determinant of monetary contraction in all countries (except
the U.S.) suggests that arbitrage in stock prices was a channel for the international
trZansmission of crises.

Finally section 5 contains a conclusion and discusses some implications
of the historical record for the present situation.

2. THEORETICAL APPROACHES TO FINANCIAL CRISES
Of two main approaches to understanding the role and importance of financial
crises, the approach of Friedman and Schwartz (l963a) and Cagan (1965) identifies

financial crises with banking panics. Banking panics in turn may be a source
of monetary contraction or may aggravate the effects of monetary contraction

4

on economic activity.4 The second approach following the seminal work of
Fisher (1932), views financial crises as a part of the normal functioning
of the business cycle, and explains them as a natural consequence of "financial

fragility" and "overindebtedness."
The Monetarist Approach to Financial Crises
In their monumental A Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960,
Friedman and Schwartz devote considerable attention to the role of banking
panics in producing monetary instability in the United States.

For Friedman

and Schwartz, banking panics are important because of their effects on the

money supply and hence on economic activity. Over the approximate one—hundred-year
span studied, the United States had six severe contractions, of which four
were marked by major banking or monetary disturbances (Friedman and Schwartz,

l963a, p. 677). Indeed banking panics "have greatly intensified (severe)
contractions if indeed they have not been the primary factor converting what
would otherwise have been mild contractions into severe ones" (1963a, pp. 441-442).
According to Friedman and Schwartz, banking panics arise out of the loss
of confidence by the public in the ability of banks to convert deposits into

currency. A loss of confidence is typically precipitated by the failure of
some important financial institution (e.g. as in 1873, 1893). Attempts by
the public to increase the fraction of its money holdings held in currency
in a fractional reserve banking system can only be met by a multiple contraction

of deposits. A banking panic in turn, if not allayed by the suspension of
convertibility of deposits into currency and the issuance of clearing house
certificates (as was often the case before the establishment of the Federal

S

Reserve in 1914) or by early intervention by the monetary authorities, will

produce massive bank failures. Such failures will be the consequence of otherwise
Sound banks being forced into insolvency by a fail in the value of their assets
induced by a mass scramble for liquidity.

Banking panics leading to widespread bank failures, such as occurred
in the 1929—33 period, primarily by reducing the money stock through a decline
in both the deposit—currency and deposit—reserve ratios, have deleterious
effects on economic activity.
Friedman and Schwartz make an important distinction between the arithmetic
and the economic aspects of a banking panic.

In their discussion of the panic

of 1893 they state "the panic had important effects on the banking structure,...;
and it undoubtedly affected the detailed timing, form, and impact of the economic
adjustment.

At the same time, it was at bottom simply the way in which an

adjustment, forced by other considerations, worked itself out. The price
declines abroad and the distrust of the maintenance of the gold standard by
the United States meant that there were only two alternatives:

(1) a sizable

decline in U.S. prices and a decline or a reduced rate of rise in money income;
or (2) the abandonment of the gold standard and the depreciation of the dollar

relative to other currencies. Given the maintenance of the gold standard,
the adjustments in prices and income were unavoidable. If they had not occurred
through the banking panic and the accompanying deepening of the recession
underway, they would have taken place in some other way" (Friedman and Schwartz,
1963, pp. 110—11 ).

Indeed the peculiarities of the U.S. banking system as it developed in
the nineteenth century with its unit fractional reserve banking system and

6

reserves pyramided in New York made it highly susceptible to banking panics.
This vulnerability was finally ended by the introduction of federal deposit

insurance in 1934 which served to remove the public's fear for its ability
to convert deposits into currency.
Friedman and Schwartz highlight the importance in the pre FDIC system

of strong and responsible leadership exercising timely judgment in intervening

to allay the public's fears. Before the advent of the Fed, such intervention
by the New York clearing banks in suspending convertibility and issuing clearing
house certificates and, on occasion, in conducting open market purchases by

the Treasury was generally successful, although not sufficient to prevent

severe monetary contraction. The Federal Reserve System established in part
to provide such leadership failed dismally in the 1929—33 contraction.

According to Friedman and Schwartz, had the Fed conducted open market
operations in 1930 and 1931 to provide the reserves needed by the banking
system, the series of bank failures producing the massive unprecedented declineS
in the money stock would have been prevented.

Finally according to Friedman and Schwartz, economic disturbances are

spread internationally by the monetary standard. U.S. monetary disturbances
during the 1929-33 contraction quickly spread abroad to other gold countries

through the gold exchange standard. Only countries on flexible exchange rates
with the U.S., such as China, and Spain, escaped its ravages.5
Cagan (1965) in Determinants and Effects of Changes in the Stock of Money,

1875—1960, carefully analyzed the role of banking panics in the cyclical behavior
of the [1.5. morLey supply. Cagan, like Friedman and Schwartz, explained the

7

incidence of panics by events such as the failure of prominent financial institutions

or railroads. The resulting decline in the public's confidence in the banks,
by raising both the public's currency-money ratio and the banking system's

reserve-deposit ratio, led to a contraction in the money supply.6 Cagan attributed
the high incidence of banking panics in the U.S. experience "to the pre—World
War I banking system with its inverted pyramid of credit resting on New York
City banks and the absence of emergency reserves provided by a central bank.
and to "sharp outflows of gold which sometimes forced banks to contract credit
too fast" (Cagan, 1965, pp. 226—227).

Finally, Cagan presented strong evidence that panics in the U.S. experience
did not precipitate cyclical downturns since they all followed peaks in economic

activity. Moreover, though panics were important in several cycles in reducing

money growth more than would otherwise have happened and in converting mild
contractions into severe contractions, he concluded based on the evidence
of two severe cyclical downturns not associated with banking panics——l920—21
and 1937-38—-and two mild cyclical downturns that were associated with panics—-1890

and 1914-—that panics were neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for
producing a severe contraction.
Huffrnan and Lothian (1984) focus on the international transmission of

business cycles under the pre—1933 gold standard. They view monetary shocks
as the key sources of cyclical fluctuations, with the fixed—exchange—rate

gold standard the primary mechanism for transmission of shocks abroad. An
unexpected decline in the money supply in one country (say, the United States)

will reduce income and prices and raise interest rates in that country leading
to a balance of payments surplus and a gold and capital inflow from another

-

(say Great Britain).

8

In Great Britain, the gold outflow will reduce the money

supply, prices and real output and raise interest rates, leading to a new

equilibrium. Empirical evidence based on Granger—Sims causality tests provides
support for the paramount role of specie flows and money supplies in the pre—1933
gold standard transmission mechanism.

Since financial crises are important only to the extent that they affect
the money supply, they should not be a crucial part of the transmission mechanism.
In a comparison of coninon cycles in the United States and Great Britain, 1830-1933,

Huffman and Lothian found panics in only three of twelve common cycles. This
leads them to conclude that little importance should be attached to panics
as a direct channel of international transmission of cyclical fluctuations.

The Fisher—Minsky—Kindleberger Approach
In contrast to the monetarist approach which regards financial crises

as important via their influence on monetary aggregates, a tradition going
back to the nineteenth century regards financial crises as an essential part
of the upper turning point of the business cycle——as a necessary consequence

of the "excesses" of the previous boom. The modern proponents, Minsky and
Kindleberger, basically extend the views Irving Fisher expressed in Booms
and Depressions (1982).

According to Fisher (1932) and (1933) the business cycle is explained

by two key factors: overindebtedness and deflation.
"Disturbances in these two factors——debt and the purchasing power of
the monetary unit-—will set up serious disturbances in all, or nearly all,

other economic variables. On the other hand, if debt and deflation are absent,
other disturbances are powerless to bring on crises comparable in severity
to those of 1837, 1873, or 1929—33" (Fisher, 1933, p. 341).

9

The upsiing in the cycle is precipitated by some exogenous event that
provides new, profitable opportunities for investment in key sectors of the

economy. Such 'starters" can be new inventions, gold discoveries or wars.
The exogenous shock encourages new investment in those sectors that increase

output and prices. Rising prices by raising profits encourages more investment

but also encourages speculation for capital gain. The whole process is debt
financed, primarily by bank loans, which in turn by increasing deposits and

the money supply raises the price level. An overall sense of optimism will
raise velocity, fueling the expansion even further. Moreover the rising price
level by reducing the real value of outstanding debt more than the increase
in nominal debt encourages further borrowing.

The process continues until

a general state of "overindebtedness"——defjned as 'whatever degree of indebtedness
multiplies unduly the chances of becoming insolvent"—— is reached (Fisher,

1932, p. 9). A state of overindebtedness exists when individuals, firms,
and banks have insufficient liquid assets to meet their liabilities.

In such

a situation a crisis can be triggered by •errors in judgment by debtors or

creditors. Debtors unable to pay debts when due and unable to refinance their
positions may be forced by creditors to liquidate their assets
Such "distress selling" if widespread then triggers a "liquidity crisis"
that could in turn lead to a "debt crisis," a "banking crisis," and a deep
depression unless the process is averted by intervention by the monetary authorities..

Distress selling if engaged in by the whole community produces a decline in
the price level because, as loans are extinguished and not renewed, bank deposits

decline. As the price level falls the real value of outstanding debt rises
and, according to Fjsher, based on the assumption of money illusion both by

10

debtors and creditors, it rises faster than nominal debt is extinguished. Thus
creditors see the nominal value of their collateral declining with the price
level and hence continue to call their loans, while the real debt burden of

debtors rises so they continue to liquidate. A fallacy of composition takes
over, each individual joining the liquidation to avoid being worse off, while
the community as a whole by reducing the price level actually becomes worse

off. The process can proceed to involve bank runs as fears for their solvency
rise, and to raise the demand for money as a sense of pessimism spreads.

Real economic activity is affected by falling prices that reduce net

worth and profits leading to bankruptcy. Both factors contribute to a decline
in output and employment.

In addition, while nominal interest rates fall

with deflation, real rates are increased, worsening the situation. The process
can continue until either widespread bankruptcy has eliminated the overindebtedness,

or at any state a reflationary monetary policy is adopted. However, once
recovery begins, the whole process will repeat itself. Finally, depressions
are transmitted from country to country by the monetary standard.7
Minsky in a series of articles since 1957 has elaborated and extended

Fisher's theory.8 Basically Minsky has extended the notion of overindebtedness
and the processes which produce it by his concept of fragility.
According to Minsky, as the economy proceeds through the upwsing of the

business cycle, the financial structure becomes more fragile. A crisis occurs
when a fragile financial structure is shocked by some event that triggers
a sell-off of assets in a thin market producing a sharp decline in asset prices

(Minsky, 1977, 140). The fragility or robustness of a financial structure
is determined by three factors: a) the mix of hedge, speculative, and Ponzi

11

finance; b) the liquidity of the portfolio; c) the extent to which ongoing
investment is debt financed.

Minsky's terms are defined as follows: "if a unit's cash flow commitments
on debts are such that over each significant period the cash receipts are
expected to exceed the cash payments by a significant margin, the unit is

said to be engaged in hedge financing." Speculative financing is defined
as "cash flow payments over some period——typically near term-—that exceed

the cash flows expected over this period." A Ponzi finance unit "is a speculative
unit for which the interest portion of its cash payment conirnitrnents exceeds

its net income cash receipts. A Ponzi unit has to increase its debt in order
to meet its commitments on outstanding instruments" (1977, p. 143). The importance
of speculative and Ponzi finance is that a rise in the interest rate can convert
a positive into a negative present value, precipitating insolvency.
According to Minsky's approach, in the upswing of the cycle, the demand
for new investment in response to improved profit opportunities leads to a

demand for finance. Part of the new investment is directly financed by short-term
bank loans, part by equity, and part by long-term debt. As the economy expands

it geneates an excess demand for finance, raising interest rates. However,
the excess demand is partially and temporarily offset by financial innovation,

which in turn fuels the finance of further investment.9 Thus, the investment
boom is fueled both by an endogenous (elastic) money supply and elastic velocity.
As interest rates rise, four factors work to create a fragile financial
envi ronment:

10

12

a)
b)
c)
d)

an increase in debt finance
a shift from long term to short term debt
a shift from hedge to speculative to Ponzi finance
a reduction in financial institutions' margin of safety

Once a fragile environment is in place, a further rise in interest rates
by shifting hedge to speculative to Ponzi financing can precipitate a refinancing

crisis where firms are unable to "rollover" their debt. In that situation
Fisher's "distress selling" process can be generated with all the attendant

consequences. The crisis can be aborted however by the central bank acting

as a lender of last resort to the money marketsit
Finally, Minsky's thesis can also explain the international transmission

of crises. Commercial banks lending abroad face additional risks. The risks
include reater economic and political uncertainty that increase the likelihood
of default and capital losses from unexpected changes in exchange rates.]tt

13

Kindleberger (1978) follows Minsky and Fisher, embellishing the story

with pages of anecdotes from history. Basically some displacement which improves
profit opportunities leads to an investment boom, fueled by bank money and

rising velocity. This in turn produces a "speculative mania" involving a
shift from money to goods, "overtrading" and then "distress". At that point
some event triggers a massive shift from goods to money and a "panic" results
(Kindleberger, 1978, p. 5).

Kindleberger expands on the international transmission mechanism. In
addition to the traditional links of gold flows, the balance of trade, and
capital flows, he stresses the importance of psychological factors, commodity
arbitrage, and interest arbitrage which, by linking the banking systems of
different countries directly, can offset the normal operations of the classical
price—specie—flow mechanism.

13

Although Minsky's model is limited to a single country, over—
trading has historically tended to spread from one country to another.
The conduits are many. Commodity prices may rise and so may the
prices of securities that are traded internationally. Speculation
in exports, imports, or foreign securities furnishes direct links
between markets of countries. By these means euphoria and overtrading
in one country can be fed by capital inflows from foreign purchases
of particular goods and assets. And if these capital flows lead
to inflows of gold or silver, monetary expansion in the original
country is enhanced as the boom is fueled by additional supplies
of money on which higher pryamids of credit can be supported.
In
an ideal world, of course, a gain of specie for one country would
be matched by a corresponding loss for another, and the resulting
expansion in the first case would be offset by the contraction in
the second.
In the real world, however, while the boom in the first
country might gain speed from the increase in the supply of reserves,
or "high-powered money", it might also rise in the second despite
the loss in monetary reserves, as investors respond to rising prices
and profits abroad by joining in the speculative chase.
In other
words, the potential contraction from the shrinkage on the monetary
side might be overwhelmed by the increase in speculative interest
and the rise in demand. For the two countries together, in any
event, the credit system is stretched tighter.
Kindleberger views a flexible exchange rate as an important conduit for

the international transmission of financial crises-—exchange appreciation
and deflation, or exchange depreciation and inflation.. .can be connected with

bankruptcies, bank suspensions and changes in the money supply" (p. 119).
Finally, as do Fisher and Minsky, Kindleberger assumes a role to a lender
of last resort to abort the crisis but, with his additional emphasis on the
international nature of financial crisis, he stresses the need for an international

lender of last resort)4
A Comparison of the Two Approaches
The two main approaches to the role and importance of financial crises

differ in two ways. The first is over the importance of monetary change as
the primary conduit through which financial crises affect economic activity.
According to the monetarist approach, it is primarily by reducing money growth

14

more than otherwise that the banking system when affected by a crisis, has

an impact on the economy. By contrast, the Kindleberger—Minsky approach sees
financial crises as being important largely independent of effects on the
money supply.

A second difference is the importance of monetary factors in the international
transmission of financial crises. According to the rnonetarist approach, transmission
should occur primarily via the monetary standard by precipitating gold flows
(or changes in international reserves) between countries that affect monetary

bases and hence money supplies. Under flexible exchange rates, transmission
would be muted. By contrast, in the Kindleberger—Fiinsky approach, transmission
can occur through a wide variety of channels including the monetary channel.

One key channel stressed by Kindleberger and Minsky is the direct link between

the banking systems of different countries. Moreover, flexible exchange rates
may serve to accelerate transmission.

In what follows we examine the extent to which historical evidence for
six countries in the period 1870—1933 conforms to each of these theories.

MONEY, ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND FINANCIAL CRISES: THE INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE
In this section is presented evidence in Table 1 for six countries in

the period 1870—1933 on the behavior of real and monetary variables during

cyclical contractions marked by financial crises. Because of data limitations
for the majority of countries much of the focus is on annual data. The use
of annual data, though the best available, makes it more difficult to discuss
the influence of a phenomenon such as a banking panic or a stock market crash
than would be possible with monthly or weekly data.

15

Six countries are included. The United States, Great Britain, Germany
and France were the "core" countries in the

period, with virtually all of

the "crises' either originating in them or greatly amplified by them.

The

four countries were linked over much of the period by the gold standard and
gold exchange standards as well as by close real trade and financial links.
Unfortunately, reliable monetary data are available over the entire period
for only two of the countries——the United States and Great Britain. For Germany
coverage is limited to the pre World War I period and for France to the

post

World War I period, and even then the data are spotty. Two "peripheral" but
important countries with reliable data were chosen in addition to the four
•core countries——canada (for the period 1900—1933) and Sweden (over the whole

period). The two were closely linked to the "core" countries—-canada to the
U.S., and Great Britain; Sweden to Great Britain and Germany.
Real Variables
Twelve "common international" reference cycles are isolated by picking
turning points in the NBER reference cycle chronology for each country that
corresponded as closely as possible to the British reference cycle pattern.
Thus for example, the second cycle for Great Britain has a peak in 1883 and
a trough in 1886, the comparable cycle for the United States has a peak in

1882 and a trough in 1885. Moreover the five other countries (in fact) had
more (the U.S. had 16) or fewer reference cycles (Germany had 11), than Great
Britain, but all these deviations in dating occurred within or very close

to the British cycle. These deviations are characterized as subcycles to
the common international cycle and the dates are presented in parentheses under

the common international cycle dates.15 Thus e.g., in the third cycle Great

16

Britain has a peak in 1890, a trough in 1894, the comparable "common" U.S.

cycle is designated as having a peak in 1890 and a trough in 1894. This dating
involved combining for the U.S. three NBER reference cycles designated here
as subcycles—-taking the peak from the second NBER reference cycle and the
trough frohi the third.

In addition, following Burns and Mitchell (1946), six cyclical contractions
are designated as severe denoted by (S)——cycles (1), (2), (3), (7), (9), and

(12). Column (1) of Table 1 presents the annual, and the monthly, displayed
in [], "common international" reference cycle chronology, for the peaks and

troughs in business cycle contractions. Both annual and monthly data exist
for all countries except Sweden, for which only annual data is available. Cyclical
contractions are focused on since most financial, banking and stock market
crises have occurred at or shortly after the reference peak and have been
associated with the severity of the ensuing cyclical contraction.
Column (2) presents a measure of the severity of decline in real economic
activity during cyclical contractions in each country——the deviation of the
average annual percentage change in real output from the long-run trend growth
rate.

In general the severity of contractions differed considerably across

countries in the "common cycles" although the six NBER designated severe cyclical
contractions had the greatest declines in real activity in all the countries.
Financial Variables

Columns (3), (4) and (5) show the incidence for the core countries based

on various sources, of crises. Three definitions reflecting the literature
are used. For the two peripheral countries, only minimal comparable evidence
was available, shown in two columns for Canada, one for Sweden.

17

Column (3) cites the presence of "financial crises"

according to Kindleberger's

(1978) chronology of international financial crisesH6' 11
the presence of stock market crises

Column (4) cites

according to Morgenstern's (1959) chronology.

In addition, following Morgenstern, superscripts indicate whether a crisis

was a major or minor, and international or local in scope. Finally, column (5)
cites, based on Thorp (1926), Friedman and Schwartz (1963a) and other sources,
the presence of banking crises, classified by superscripts as banking panics
(runs, failures, and suspension of payments) and banking crises (runs and

or failures). Most banking crises and virtually all banking panics were confined
to the U.S. in thi's period.

The qualitative evidence on the incidence of crises is supported by the
timing of turning points in two key financial variables——the long—term—short—term
interest rate differential, and Morgenstern's index of stock prices. Columns (6)
and (7) show the peaks and troughs on a monthly basis of these two financial
variables.

In column (6) the interest differential chronology is reversed, reflecting

financial pressure at the specific cycle trough and ease at the peak.

In

general the troughs in this series are very close to the corresponding reference

cycle peaks, tending to follow them by only a few months. At the same time
peaks in the stock price index (column 6) tend to precede reference cycle

peaks, reflecting the stock markets role as a frequent leading indicator
of economic activity.

Monetary Variables
Columns (8) to (13) for the three core countries except France, and column (14)

for the U.S. and Great Britain display monetary variables. Monetary variables
for Canada appear in columns (5) to (10) and for Sweden in columns (4) to (8).

18

Column (8) for the care countries, columns (5) and (4) far Canada and
Sweden, respectively, present a chronology of peaks and troughs of specific

cycles in monetary growth corresponding to the reference cycle chronology
-

of

column (1). Annual or monthly (depending on the frequency of the available

data) turrtfng points were derived following procedures developed by Friedman
and Schwartz (1963b).

For the U.S., turning points in money growth generally precede those

in business by a calendar year. However, as can be seen from the monthly
series in brackets, the use of annual averaged data greatly distorts the true

measure of the lead. Nevertheless since monthly data are available only for
Canada besides the U.S. ,

the annual data is used as a crude measure of timing.

For the other countries, the turning points in money growth generally
precede but in numerous cases coincide with the turning points in business.18
Column (9) shows the deviations from long—run trend of the average rate
of money growth between peaks and troughs as a measure of the severity of
monetary contraction.

In virtually every case, with the principal exception

of World War I in Great Britain, declines in money growth below trend are
associated with declines in economic activity in the corresponding reference

cycle contraction. Indeed the greater is the deviation of money growth from
trend, the greater the decline in economic activitiy. The most severe declines
in both money and real output occur in severe cycles characterized in many

instances by financial and stock market crises. However, the greatest declines
of all the countries examined here (with the exception of the 1920—21 episode)
occurred in the U.S. in contractions associated with banking crises.

19

Columns (10) to (12) for the three core countries

(excluding France),

column (7) to (9) for Canada and (6) to (8) for Sweden show the contributions
to the specific cycle contractions in monetary growth for the three determinants

of the money supply: high-powered money; the deposit-currency ratio; and
the deposit—reserve ratio.

Cagan (1965), in his pioneering study for the U.S., found the currency-money
ratio to be the key determinant of cyclical movements in the noney supply

with high—powered money and the reserve ratio each having about one half of

the influence of the currency ratio. For severe cycles, the order of magnitude
remained the same but the influence of the currency ratio increased)9 Both
Cagan and Friedman and Schwartz present evidence for the U.S. that in severe

cycles characterized by banking panics, declines in the deposit—currency ratio
and hence in the deposit reserve ratio on several occasions led to declines
in money growth sufficient to produce a severe contraction in economic activity.
Such results for the U.S. can be clearly seen in column (12) for the banking
panics of 1893, and the great contraction of 1929—33.
For Great Britain, in contrast to the U.S., high-powered money was
the key determinant of cyclical contractions in money, followed by the deposit—

currency ratio and the deposit—reserve ratio.2° For Great Britain, again
in contrast to the U.S., there were no banking crises in the period under
consideration, yet the two ratios acting along or jointly produced significant

declines in money in several severe contractions associated with major stock

market crises: 1872-78; 1890—93; 1900-01; 1902—03; 1907-08; and 1928—31.
However, none of the declines of the ratios, with the exception of 1930-31,
were comparable to those observed in the U.S. case.

20

For Germany, the deposit—currency ratio was the most important determinant

of cyclical changes in money in specific cycle contractions. However, in
contrast to other countries, money only declined in one specific cycle contraction——

1906—07. With the exception of that episode where a decline in D/C produced
a decline in M, the Reichsbank caused H to vary countercyclically to offset

the procyclical behavior of the ratios.21 Similar to Great Britain, German
experience was characterized by the absence of banking crises (with the exception

of a mild crisis associated with several bank failures in 1901). Yet the
decline in the ratios, especially the DIR, seemed to coincide with major stock
market crises.

In both Canada and Sweden H and DIR were the key determinants of changes

in M in cyclical contractions,22 with D/C playing a minor role. Also both
countries were characterized by stable banking systems and the absence of

panics. In the Canadian case, the banking system's DIR declined significantly
in three severe contractions associated with financial crises abroad: 1877—78;
1894—95; and 1927_31.23
Column (14) for the U.S. and G.B. presents the loan—earning asset ratio.

This ratio reflects, in periods of financial stringency, the banking system's

desire for liquidity. Thus in a severe contraction in an effort to increase
liquidity, banks will convert loans into (primarily) government securities

in order to reduce the ratio. As can be seen in the table, in both countries
the ratio declined during several severe cycles characterized by crises.
The evidence in Table 1 suggests a number of conclusions on the relationships
of money, financial crises, and real activity in the different countries.

21

First, severe declines in economic activity in all countries are associated

with (prior) declines in money growth. Second, most severe cyclical contractions
in all the countries examined are associated with stock market crises but

not, with the exception of the U.S., with banking crises. Third, the junior
partners to high—powered money as determinants of change in money——the D/R
and D/C ratios——played an important role in reducing money growth in all countries
but not to the extent they displayed in U.S. experience, especially the role
played by the deposit—currency ratio in reducing the money supply during contractions
involving banking panics.

Why was monetary contraction associated with financial crises more severe

in the U.S. experience than in other countries? One explanation is the greater
instability, compared to that of the five other countries, of the U.S. banking
system--a system composed largely of unit fractional reserve banks with reserves

pyramided in the New York money market. Though numerous institutional reforms
were devised to strengthen the system in the period 1862—1934, none, until
the advent of federal deposit insurance in 1934, removed the basic instability

associated with potential threats to convertibility. Bank runs and panics
occurred whenever a shock threatened the solvency of a few key banks or other
financial institutions.

In contrast with the U.S. experience, the five other countries in the
sane period all developed nationwide branch banking systems consolidated into

a few very large banks. The system of bank branching, first successfully
developed in Scotland in the eighteenth century and emulated by other countries
including Canada and Sweden,24 represented a method of pooling risks which

22

proved quite effective in guarding against the type of "house of cards" effects
common to the U.S. (and early nineteenth century British) banking system.

A second explanation for the relatively poor performance of the U.S.—stemming from the massive literature on the development of central banking
and especially of the Bank of England25——is the absence of an effective "lender

of last resort." Four of the six countries in our sample had central banks,
which by the beginning of period had (in various degrees) learned in the face
of a crisis to follow Bagehot's rule "to lend freely but at a penalty rate,"
and to a certain extent to cooperate amongst themselves in times of severe

international crisis, such as the Baring crisis of 1890.26 One exception,
Canada, did not have a central bank until 1936, but the chartered banks had,
by 1890, with the compliance of the government, established an effective self—
policing agency, the Canadian Bankers Association, which acting in "locus
parentis" successfully helped insulate the Canadian banks from the deleterious

effects of U.S. banking panics in 1893 and 1907.27 The existence of such
a mechanism, whether provided by the government or by the private market,
once it proved effective would educate and instill a sense of confidence in
the public sufficient to prevent incipient crises.28
In sum the stark comparison of the U.S. with the other five countries

suggests, consistent with the monetarist approach, that financial crises involving
banking crises, had strong effects in aggravating (if not producing) the effects
of monetary contraction on the real economy.

4. THE INTERNATIONAL TRANSMISSION OF FINANCIAL CRISES
In this section we present evidence on the international transmission

of financial crises. According to the monetarist approach, financial crises
(and also business cycles) are transmitted internationally primarily through

23

the monetary standard. Under the gold standard which characterized much of
the period for all the countries (see the last column of each table for a
chronology of monetary standards by cycle,) one would expect changes in the

monetary gold stock to be the key source of change in high powered money over
the cycle unless significant sterilization is occurring. Under perfectly

flexible exchange rates no such link should prevail. Column (13) of Table 1
for the Ii. S., Great Britain, and Germany and column (10) for Canada show

the percentage change in the monetary gold stock between the specific cycle
peaks and troughs.

For the U.S., for every specific cycle contraction, except that of 1871-78
under flexible exchange rates, there is a close correlation between changes

in the monetary gold stock and changes in high—powered money; however, the

link is far from one-to—one, reflecting priodic sterilization especially
of gold outflows during contractions.
For Great Britain the association though positive is much weaker, in
accordance with the evidence of Bloomfield (1959) and others that the Bank
of England engaged in active sterilization.

For Germany, the association, though positive, is also weak. According
to McGouldrick (1984), this reflects the deliberate policy of the Reichsbank
to shield the domestic money market from external influence.
For Canada, for the few observations we have, the association is positive

and quite strong. During this period, Canada did not have a central bank
and with the exception of the operation of the Finance Act in in the interwar
period (see Shearer and Clark, 1984) did not engage in extensive intervention.

24

Such evidence, though rough, shows, in agreement with I-luffman and Lothian

(1984) linkages between the money supplies of the different countries through
gold flows and high—powered money.29
Finally, the last column in each table distinguishes between periods

of fixed and flexible exchange rates. There are too few degrees of freedom
to make other than very casual comparisons. The two significant periods of
floating: 1862—78 for the U.S. and the early 1920's for all countries except
the U.S. provide some ground for comparison of the insulation properties of

fixed and flexible rates. Thus, for example, in the 1873—79 contraction we
observe both the interest differential and stock price index cycles for the
U.S. to be more out of phase with those of the European countries than in
the rest of the period, and the U.S. contraction to be considerably milder

than its European counterpart. However, the U.S. was affected by various
European crises. Similarly in the 1920's when both France and Germany floated
over much of the period, we can observe more cycles for France and fewer for

Germany than for other countries. Also France in 1926 experienced a major
financial crisis that was not transmitted abroad.
According to the Kindleberger—Minsky approach financial crises are transmitted
primarily through nonmonetary channels such as link portfolios of financial

institutions. Evidence for this approach can be seen in an international
comparison of the peaks and troughs of the interest differential (column (6))

and the stock price index (column (7)) for the four core countries. First,
troughs in the interest differential series are more closely related between
countries than are the peaks (as discussed in detail in Morgenstern (1959),
and closer links are found between the three European countries than between
any of them and the U.S.

In addition, Morgenstern demonstrates that movements

25

in the differential are largely explained by movements in short—term interest

rates. The behavior of this series according to Morgenstern is evidence for
a tightly linked European short—tern capital market.

Morgenstern's evidence,

as well as that of Lindert (1969) on the relative pulling power of the discount
rate in different financial centers, suggests that in time of financial pressure,
securities markets were especially closely linked.

Second, turning points in the stock price index are very closely related
between the four countries, although the links between the European countries

are closer than those between the U.S. and Europe.3° A comparison of the
peaks in this series and Morgenstern's chronology of stock market crises,
shown in column (4) shows a remarkable coincidence for major crises, that

are international in scope. Such crises often originated in the U.S. and
then spread quickly to Europe.
Third, a comparison of the turning points in the two financial variables
in columns (6) and (7) with the chronology of financial, banking, and stock
market crises in columns (3), (4), and (5) suggests that crises in the gold
standard era often tended to be international in scope but, the way in which
they manifested themselves in different countries differed considerably, especially
comparing the response of the banking system in the U.S. to that of the other
countries.

A final piece of evidence consistent with the Kindleberger—Minsky view
of transmission is based on the behavior of the deposit reserve ratio in a

number of countries and the incidence of stock market crises. In four countries,
Great Britain, Germany, Canada and Sweden, declines in the deposit reserve
were key determinants of cyclical contractions in the money supply and such
contractions often occurred at the same time as stock market crises. The apparent

2€

association between declines in the DIR ratio and the incidence of stock market
crises suggests a possible additional channel of influence whereby financial

crises link money supplies between countries. The evidence indicates a link
between turning points in moneygrowth and stock price indexes (seen for the

U.S. monthly data in Table l.A by comparing columns (8) and (7))3l The link
in turn may reflect early signs of the effects of changes in money growth

on real economic activity. In combination with the evidence on the DIR, the
link suggests the following hypothetical scenario:

A sharp decline in the money stock in one country, e.g. the U.S., produced
initially by say a gold outflow, leads to a sharp decline in stock prices

(a 'crash'). The stock market crash in turn could produce, as described in
sections 1 and 2 above, in the absence of intervention, both a liquidity crisis
and a banking panic, resulting in declines in the deposit—currency and deposit—

reserve ratios. Concurrently, reflecting the tight linkage between stock
exchanges in different centers shown by Morgenstern, e.g. through a decline
in the prices of U.S. securities traded in foreign markets, the decline in
securities prices of the initiating country are transmitted to the stock market

of other countries. The decline in securities prices in these countries could
impact quickly on commercial banks that have extended call loans and brokers'

loans to the stock market and attempt to strengthen their liquidity by calling

these loans and thus reducing the loan earning asset ratio. At the same time
they increase their precautionary reserves, hence lowering the deposit—reserve
ratio.

In other words, arbitrage in stock market securities may link national

money supplies directly via their effects on commercial bank reserve ratios.
Such effects may occur before the monetary shock has had time to spread its
32

influence abroad via the traditional price specie flow mechanism.

CONCLUSION

This paper has examined two main theoretical approaches to financial
crises and provided some historical evidence sympathetic to each of them based

on the relationship of financial crises to the money supply, the financial
system, and real activity over the period 1870—1933 in six countries. The
evidence though highly suggestive yields the following conclusions.
The first is the important role of monetary institutions, particularly
the banking system, in explaining why some countries had more serious monetary

and real contractions in the face of crises. The absence of a nationwide
branch banking system in the United States compared to five other countries
examined, and the less effective role played by the U.S. monetary authorities
in acting as a lender of last resort may explain why the U.S. experienced

banking panics in a period when they were an historical curiosity in other
countries.

The second is an apparent connection in all the countries examined between

crises in the stock market and a decline in the commercial banking systems
deposit reserve ratio. Such a relationship may provide an alternative link
between the money supplies of different countries in addition to the traditional

linkages through gold flows and the balance of payments. A possible avenue
for fruitful further research might be to examine, using monthly data and
time series analysis, the timing of the relationship between different international

monetary linkages——on the one hand, between the stock market and other asset
markets and commercial bank portfolios, and on the other hand between gold
and international reserve flows and the monetary base.
In sun we can ask what lessons does the record of financial crises from

1870 to 1933 have for the present day situation? Key differences in institutional

28

arrangements suggest that most of the factors conducive to financial crises,
especially banking crises, and their international propagation have declined
in importance.

First

-

the domestic banking systems of most major countries are more stable——

less likely to be subject to runs and panics——than they were before 1933.

This is especially the case of the United States following the adoption of
FDIC in 1934 and acknowledgement by the Federal Reserve System of its role

as lender of last resort. Second, we are no longer part of the fixed exchange
rate gold standard which tended to transmit economic disturbances from country
to country (although there is increasing evidence that flexible exchange rates
may not be as effective insulators as were believed).
This is not to say that financial crises can no longer occur but that
the likelihood of events such as the recent near failure of the Continental
Illinois bank producing a worldwide series of financial crises (as often occurred
before 1933) is less likely.

1lndeed this interest has in the last three years spawned three conference
volumes (Kindleberger and Laffargue (1983), Wachtel (19.82), and Capie and

Wood (1985)) and a number of important journal articles.
2A third recent approach is that of rational expectations that views

financial crises as a consequence of rational behaviour. According to this
approach, "manias" are viewed as examples of speculative bubbles. (Flood
and Garber, 1982, Blanchard and Watson, 1982), 'runs" are defined as a speculative
attack on an asset price fixing scheme (Garber, 1981) and 'panics' characterize
a run whose timing was not perfectly foreseen. (Garber, 1981).
3See Fisher (1935) and Huffman and Lothian (1984).
4A recent approach taken by Bernanke (1983) and Diamond and Dybvig (1983)
argues that financial crises including bankruptcies have direct effects on

economic activity over and above their effects on the money supply. To the
extent that financial crises produce losses in the financial sector of the

economy, this raises the cost of financial intermediation and hence reduces
the efficiency of resource allocation.

6According to Gorton (1982) banking panics are not a unique event but
represent a rational response by depositors wishing to smooth out their consumption

flows over time. Rational depositors wish to dissave in periods of expected
low consumption such as business cycle troughs but, since the likelihood of
suspensions of convertibility also would be highest at the trough, depositors
will rush to convert their deposits to currency when they expect a trough
to occur.

in the great depression.

13Minsky's thesis has been criticized by Sinai (1979) for not yielding
any testable hypotheses, and by Goldsmith (1979) on the ground that the evidence
of history is against a key implication of Minsky's view——that financial development

and financial fragility are positively correlated. Melitz (1979) argues that
Minsky's thesis is inconsistent with evidence on the behavior of the term
structure of interest rates and the experience of countries with universal
lenders of last resort such as Sweden.

Finally, Fleming (1979) argues that

one implication of Minsky's thesis——that the boom lulls economic agents into
taking a risky financial position conducive to a crisis——leads to the implausible
suggestion that central banks should increase the amount of risk in the economic
system.

141n his discussion of the 1873, 1920—21 and 1931 crises, Kindleberger
(1978) and (1973) argues that the crises could have been aborted by the effective
operation of a supernationa] monetary authority.
effectively argues that in the case of 1920-21

,

However, Moggridge (1982)

there was no crisis hence

no need for the lender of last resort and in 1931 that though there was a
considerable amount of international cooperation, the fundamental disequilibrium
of the international monetary system could not have been alleviated by an
international lender of last resort.
15The use of the common international

cycle is purely descriptive to

facilitate international comparisons. The discussion which follows for each
country alone is based on the NBER reference cycle chronology.

16Also included are a number of extra "financial crises" based on Thorp
(1926), Veager (1972), and others.

17This demarcation of crises begs the question of whether all these events

really were crises. On this point, see Schwartz (1985)
18The observed lead from the turning points in money growth to the reference
cycle for the U.S. has been widely cited as an important piece of evidence

for "causality" from money to business. See Friedman and Schwartz (l963b),
Poole (1975). For a counter view, see Tobin (1970) and Friedman's (1970) reply.
Recent advances in the methodology of testing "for causality" Sims (1972)
confirm Friedman and Schwartz's evidence for a U.S. monetary cycle (the traditional

quantity theory approach) but the case is mixed for other countries. Mills
and Wood (1979) and Williams, Goodhart & Gowland (1976) provide evidence
for the U.K. of "causality" running from business to money in both the gold

standard and subsequent Bretton Woods era. These authors explain reverse

32

causality by arguing that the U.K. under fixed exchange rates operated as
a small open economy, according to the monetary approach to the balance of
payments, with changes in its money supply via reserve flows caused by changes

in money demand which in turn effect changes in economic activity. This is
compared to the U.S., viewed essentially as a closed economy in this period,
in which changes in the money supply, interact with a stable money demand
to produce changes in activity according to the traditional quantity theory

approach. However, Cassese and Lothian (1982) present convincing evidence
for a number of countries under fixed exchange rates consistent both with
a dynamic stock adjustment version of the monetary approach to the balance
of payments and a monetary theory of the cycle.
19For the 16 reference cycles displayed here, the relative contributions

of the determinants to cyclical contractions were: H, 67.6; DIR, 3.9; and
0/c, 30.1. For six severe cycles, it was H, 38.7; DIR, 16.2; and DIG, 47.6.
20Over the 12 British cycles the relative contributions of the determinants
to cyclical contractions were:
contractions, they were:

H,

H, 79.3; D/C, 18.9; and DIR, 9.1. For severe

109.0; OR, 19.7; and 0/C, —28.7.

21See McGouldrick (1983).
22See Hay (1968) and Jonung (1976).

231n the gold standard period, the Canadian chartered banks kept a large
proportion of their gold reserves in the New York, and to a lesser extent,

London money markets. These outside reserves provided a direct link between
financial conditions in these countries and Canada through the D/R ratio. See
Hay (1967, 1968) and Rich (1983).

33

24For the Scottish banking experience, see Cameron (1967) and White (1983);
for Canada, see Jamieson (1959); for Sweden see Jonung (1977). For a comparison
between the U.S. and Canadian experiences, see White (1982).
25See e.g. Sayers (1957).
26See Sayers (1936) and Presnell (1967).

27This was done by quickly arranging mergers between sound and failing
banks, by encouraging cooperation between strong and weaker banks in times
of stringency, and by establishing a reserve fund to be used to compensate

deposit holders in the event of failure. Friedman and Schwartz (1963) argue
that the New York Clearing House performed a somewhat similar role in stemming
incipient crises before 1914 through the issue of clearing house certificates
and by arranging for syndicates of strong banks to assist those in trouble.
As Schwartz (1985) argues, in most cases the system worked but in two important

exceptions, 1893 and 1907, it did not. These may be explained, she argues,
by bad timing of relief in 1907 and public misinformation in 1893.
28See Schwartz (1985).

29Additional evidence is provided by significant correlations between
five successive pairs of countries, in periods characterized by severe cyclical
declines in economic activity, of the year to year rates of change of high

powered money. The correlations are: U.S.- G.B. .45; U.S.-Germany .53; U.S.-Sweden
.49; and Germany—Sweden .79.

30Morgensterns indices include many securities which today would be
called bonds. Also a significant fraction of the securities in the samples
underlying the indexes for the European exchanges were foreign securities

(both government and private). See Morgenstern (1959), pp. 507-528 for an
extensive discussion of the several direct linkages between stock exchanges
in the gold standard era.

34

31See Sprinkel (1971) for additional U.S. evidence.

320r even possibly before raising short—term interest rates and causing

short—term capital to flow. This would be consistent with Morgenstern's finding
that peaks in the short—term interest rates cycle tended to follow peaks in
business whenever the stock market index would precede it.
