Conventional Valuation and
the Term Structure
of Interest Rates

ABSTRACT

There does not appear to be a general tendency for

long—term interest rates either to overreact or to underreact to
short—term interest rates relative to a rational expectations

model of the term structure. Rather, there appears to be some
tendency -f or markets to set long—term interest rates in terms of

a convention or rule of thumb that makes long rates behave as a
distributed lag, with gradually declining coefficients, o-f

short—term interest rates. People seem to remember the recent

past but blur the mare distant. In some monetary policy regimes
this convention implies overreaction, in others underreaction.

Introduction

It

is

plausible that prices of long—term bonds and other

long—term assets would be heavily influenced by social

conventions or "rules of thumb". Investors may assume that
markets price long—term bonds roughly according to the convention
that their yield to maturity

will

be equal to their recent

memories of the level of short—term interest rates plus a

constant "risk premium." Such an assumption might be largely
self—fulfilling,, since people who believe the convention

characterizes market prices may act to make it do approximately
so -

It

is also plausible that prices of long—term bonds are

influenced by changing perceptions unrelated to any such

mechanistic rule of thumb. Changing attitudes fashions,, public
confidence or beliefs would plausibly account also -f or some

unpredictable drift in long—term interest rates.

Togetherc the conventional valuation rule and the
unpredictable drift notions might be regarded as Keynesian.
K:eynes said at one point that the long—term interest rate is "a

highly psychological phenomenon" and at another that it is
"highly conventional... .its actual value is largely governed by

—-:—

the prevailing view as to what its value is expected to be.''

The literature on efficient markets is widely interpreted as
providing evidence contrary to this conventional—psychological

view. If people are guided exclusively by convention or by
changing fashions or attitudes, then it seems likely that they
should create "profit opportunities" for others not blinded by

convention. The general impression in the profession from the
large literature testing + or market efficiency is that such

profit opportunities do not exist. Ironically, this general
impression persists even though there is no agreement about whic!2

efficient markets model is supported by the data.
The Rational Expectations theory of the term structure of
interest rates with constant risk premium is the form of the

efficient markets models most widely cited with regard to

interest rates. The theory is a useful starting point from which

to describe the behavior of interest rates.2 Departures from the
theory are usually referred to in terms o-f time—variation a-F risk

premia. and showing how the expectations theory fails might also
be described as describing the behavior through time of the risk

premium. The expectations theory with constant risk premium has
had its ups and downs when tested with data. Sutch [1968].

mind the literature on multiple rational expectations
equilibrium, as for example in Cass and Shell [1983]. But here
it will not be assumed that rules of thumb are strictly rational.
2. There are actually a number o-f variants a-f this theory with
similar implications for data. They will be unified in a
linearized model below.

Modigliani and Shiller [1973] and Sargent [1979] have claimed

evidence supportive of the theory. Later. however, it was
claimed that the theory could be rejected: Shiller [1979], Hansen
and Sargent [1981]..

I then claimed that long—term interest rates

appear to be too volatile to be in accordance with such simple

expectations theories. Vet the evidence for the claimed excess
volatility of long—term interest rates was itself criticized by
Flavin [1983]

[1984)

and others.. Moreover, it was claimed by

Campbell and Shiller [1984] and Mankiw and Summers [1984) that

recent U. S. long—term interest rates do not seem to overreact to
short—term interest rates.

This paper will attempt to straighten out some of these
apparently conflicting claims, as well as to point to directions

for alternatives to rational expectations models. The simple
linearized expectations model will be described and compared with

the data. New in this paper are estimates of Modigliani—Sutch
equations, characterizing in simple terms how long and short
rates are related, -for

a

number of sample periods and two

countries. This gives us a better picture o-f

the

robustness of

the relation, and enables us to view it under different monetary

policy regimes. Some notions of uoverreactionu of long—term
interest rates to short rates will be studied, and estimates and
standard deviations of the extent of overreaction or
underreaction will be presented for the various sample periods..

This puts on a surer footing some comparisons made by Sutch
[1967) and Modigliani and Shiller [1973].

Finally,

an attempt

will be made here to determine whether the reliance on a
conventional valuation formula or the component of long rate
unrelated to lagged shDrt rates might be considered the reason
that the slope of the term structure gives wrong signals as to
the course of future interest rates,

It is important first to clarify in what sense the long rate
is actually described by the sort of convention mentioned above.

Modigliani and Butch (1966] were the first to show that the
long—term interest rate might well be described as a simple
distributed lag on short—term interest rates, or, in terms of the
annual data used in this paper:':

distributed lags that include the current and four lagged values,
approximately the same total lag length as Modigliani and Butch
(1966] used with their quarterly data. Throughout this paper the
term "short rate" and "one—period rate" will be used
interchangeably, though in the data sets the short rates are not
exactly one—year rates.

lag coefficients after (was hump shaped, with comparatively
small values for interest rates corresponding to lags of less
than a year or more than three years, and the largest values for
lags of about two years.

Modigliani and Sutch interpreted this distributed lag as

representing the combined effect of two different expectations

mechanisms for future short—term interest rates. A regressive
expectations mechanism would make expected future short rates a
moving average (with positive weights that decline exponentially

with increasing lag) of current and lagged short rates. An

extrapolative

expectations mechanism would make the expected

change in short—term interest rates a moving average with
positive weights (that decline with lag) o-f current and lagged

changes in short—term interest rates. The combination of both

that they found in their estimates. They

did

not refer to "rational expectations" (actually they referred to
Keynes 11936]) in motivating these mechanisms, so it seems that
they were at that time referring to habits of thought or
conventions people use to formulate expectations.

by Modigliani and Shiller [1973] to allow for a separate effect

Estimates of equation (1) for data sets other than those

sample periods used here were chosen with the idea of looking
separately at various monetary policy regimes (see Appendix) in

two countries, the U.S. and the UK. There is a

and -For two different countries there is some consistency in the

distributed lag has an exponential appearance, gradually tailing

than the rest, suggesting that the last coefficient is proxying

There are, however, some differences in response patterns
across sample periods.. The more recent data sets show a much
higher R—squared than do the pre—depression data sets, that

One might note that the Durbin—Watson statistic in these
regressions is uniformly low, meaning that we ought not to trust

the t—statistics from the regression. Phillips and Pippenger
[1979] siezed upon this fact to criticize Modigliani and Butch
[1964] and Modigliani and Shiller £19733.. They found that with
their quarterly U. S. data from 1955 to 1971 i-f one

They reported that the lagged interest rates were not significant

The original Modigliani—Sutch relation can also be
interpreted in terms of the spread between the long interest rate

and the short rate. Subtracting the current short rate from both
sides of the Modigliani—Sutch equation, one finds that the spread
depends negatively on the current short rate and positively on a

distributed lag of short rates The R squared in this
transformed regression is usually quite high (see the R' squared
shown in Table 1..) Thus, the spread shows a distinct tendency to

be negative when the current short rate is below a sort of

average of lagged short rates and to be positive when the current

short rate is above the average of lagged short rates. The sum
of the coefficients in the trans-formed regression is often about
zero,, indicating that the level of short interest rates has

little effect on the spread. If we added a constant to all of
the short rates over the last 5 years. the prediction for the
spread would be nearly unchanged..

The changes across sample periods in the relation of long
rates to short rates documented in Table 1 might be justified in
terms of the rational expectations theory o-F the term structure

if the time series properties of short rates had changed

appropriately across sample periods. Whether the distributed lag
coefficients like those in table 1 are consistent with the

rational expectations theory of the term structure has been the
subject of discussion for some time, starting with Richard
Sutch's Ph.D. dissertation [1967]. and my own Ph.D..
dissertation [1972]. and then with Modigliani and Shiller [1973].

these authors did not investigate whether broad changes in the

time series properties of the short rate across sample periods
could account for the changes in the relation between the long
rate and the short

rate..

Structure of Interest Rates

linearized version of the expectations theory a-f the term
structure of interest rates -for

coupon bonds was presented

in

Shiller f 1972] and Modigliani and Shiller [1973] and developed

further in Shiller [1979] Shiller Campbell and Schoenholtz
[1983] and Campbell and Shiller [1984). The underlying
assumption of this linearized expectations theory is that

long—term interest rates (yields to maturity) on coupon bonds not
far from par can be written as a weighted average of expected
future short—term interest rates with more weight on the interest
rates less far in the future.

In the extreme case of a consol.,

whose maturity is infinite., the long rate is a weighted average

of all future short—term rates! with weights which decline

geometrically into the future. The conventional assumption in
the literature testing the expectations theory of the term
structure had been that the long—rate is an unweighted average of

expected future short rates. This conventional assumption is
really appropriate as an approximation only for relatively

short—term bonds and could of course not be used to study
cansols which are part of the data for this paper.

It is helpful to write the expectations theory of the term

structure with the

help of

the concept of duration (Macaulay

— ij-) —

E1938]).. The duration o-f

a

bond is a

discount—factor—times--payment—weighted average of all the times

to payments of a bond. It is supposed to give a better measure
of how long—term a bond is than does the time to maturity.. The
formula gives less weight to the coupons and principal which
occur far into the future because these contribute relatively

less to price today, as they are heavily discounted. For par
coupon bonds whose yield to maturity in percent is r. Macaulay's
duration is:

(2)

(ig")/(ig)

Dn =

Where g=1/(1+r) and where n is the number of periods to maturity
o-F the bond.7 Thus, the duration of a consol (nap) is not

infinite but equals (1+r)/r. The duration of very long—term
bonds is just less than (1+r)/r. For example, i-f r = 57. then a

has a duration of

of

2(1 years and a 25 year bond has a

to resemble somewhat those of consols.

is a risk or liquidity premium

which is assumed constant through time.8 In this formula, each
future one—period rate is given weight corresponding to the
contribution to total duration o-f the time period to which it

applies. Since time periods further into the future have less
contribution to duration, the short rates corrsponding to these

time periods will be given less weight. Equation 3 can be
motivated in a number o-f ways. One is by linearizing the present
value formula for coupons and principal (discounted by

around r.

ccompanying the model are various expressions for
linearized holding period yields and forward rates, so that

(except for the constants ) all expected linearized holding
period yields equal the spot rate of the corresponding maturity
and all linearized forward rates equal the corresponding expected
spot rates (see Shiller, Campbell and Schoenholtz E1983] where
the accuracy o-f the linearizations was also studied). These
linearizations allow us to interpret the expectations model in

various ways without encountering the "Jensen's inequality"

0+ course, the assumption that market forecasts of future
interest rates equal autoregressive forecasts is quite

restrictive, and could easily be rejected since long—term
interest rates cannot be explained perfectly by a distributed lag
on short—term interest rates.. However, if long rates are set in

the history of short rates, then it Follows

We may say that

except for the very recent data sets, data set number one when
estimated through 1983 and data set number 2, the long—term
interest rate appear to overreact to short—term interest rates,
i.e.., p. tends to be less than the corresponding (1, i0... .,4.

There is however reason to suspect that this procedure may
be biassed toward finding overreaction, at least in some o-f the
sample periods.. In both the recent U.. S. and U. K. regressions

dealt with

this problem generally by imposing a unit root and estimating the
forecasting equation for short—term interest rates in
first—di-Fferenced form. The unit root was assumed in Modigliani

and Shiller [1973] and Campbell and Shiller [19833.10 Sutch
[1967] did not assume a unit root, but he proceeded the other

way, computing .

to have an effect on these comparisons similar to that o-f

The problem of assuming the unit root is that it forces the

p. to sum to one. Imposing the unit root thus assumes the
conclusion that there is no overreaction as defined here. It

similar point was raised by Mankiw and Shapiro [1985]
9.
regarding Flavin's [1981] observation that consumption appears to
overreact to income

unit root in their rather different procedures..

remains possible, however, that some other sort of overreaction
might be revealed with this procedure.. In Campbell and Shiller

[1983] overreaction was defined as that the L showed relatively
too much weight on the current short rate relative to short rates
lagged mare periods.

As a way of exploring this possibility, the autoregressive
equations for the short rate in Table 2 were reestimated subject

to the constraint that E. = 1,

e., a fourth order

autoregressive model + or the first difference of the short rate
was estimated.. Using (7) with p..' in place of p... the

coefficients p..' iO,4 were computed, and these also appear in
Table 3. 0+ course, we no longer find that there is overreaction
as defined above since the Ep..' =

by construction. It probably

makes sense to look at these estimated p..' only for the twentieth
century data, where short rates seem to show evidence o-f

nonstationarity. Here, the long rate appears to underreact to
the current short rate (confirming results in Campbell and
Shiller [1984]) and to put relatively too much weight or-i the
past.

None of these methods readily allows f or any formal testing

of the model. We can look to see whether the estimated
coefficients (L are similar in appearance to the implied

coefficients p i0...,4. in Table 3. but we cannot tell directly
whether the difference is statistically significant. This
shortcoming of the procedure was rectified by Sargent [1979] who

These tests may be regarded as "forward—filtered

described as involving complicated nonlinear cross—equation

the sum of the lagged coefficients is positive. This pattern of
coefficients is crudely consistent (given the estimates of

by the spread between the long rate and the short rate, as will
be discussed below.

terms of an overreaction or underreaction a-F long rates to short

absence of evidence for it in Table 1 here stands in
contradiction of the rational expectations model.

implication a-f the rational expectations theory of the term

is that relatively upward sloping term structures

(whern the long rate is greater than the short rate by more than
the usual term premium) ought to portend a subsequent increase in

rates. Relatively downward sloping term structures

(where the long rate is less than the short rate plus the usual
term premium) ought to portend subsequent decreases in interest

rates. The expectations model (3) allows us

correct

formulation must look

like this. Let us suppose to

simplify the argument that the term premium

in the model (3)

is zero, so that expected returns on both long and short debt

must be the same, and suppose that the bond is a consol. If the
long rate is above the short rate, there must be a capital loss
to offset the higher current yield an long bonds, if the high
yield is not to indicate a relatively higher expected return on

the long bond. A capital loss of course means a rise in

was Franca Modigliani who -first pointed out to me that

the -fact is just the opposite: when long—term interest rates are

above short rates the long—term interest rate shows a tendency to

decline subsequently rather than rise. Thus, when long rates are
relatively high there tends to be a subseqent capital gain on
long bonds which further augments their higher current yield.. As
far as I can tell, this fact had not been documented before.14
I showed evidence for this fact for a number of sample

periods (Shiller [1979]) and the fact was further confirmed in
Shiller, Campbell and Schoenholtz (1983], Campbell and Shiller

[1984], and Mankiw and Summers [1984]. Table 6 shows the
regressions for the data sets used in this paper.. The

t—statistics presented in Table 6 are not the usual t—statistics
but are for the null hypothesis that the coefficient of the
spread is 1/(D n—1)
This perverse behavior of the term structure relative to the

expectations hypothesis could be due to the way the long rate
responds to the short rate, as estimated in Table 1, or it could
be due to noise in the long rate series that is unrelated to the
history of short rates.. To decide which, the spread

—

was decomposed into two components: that corresponding to

the fitted value in the regressions of Table 1 and the residuals
of Table 1. Regressions of excess returns on these two variables
appear in Table 7. We see that both variables play some role.

The coefficients of the fitted spread greater than one indicate
that the pattern of reaction of long rates to short rates is part
of the reason the shape of the term structure gives wrong signals

14. This observation was made by Macaulay [1938] p. 33, who,
however, did not document it or emphasize it.

as to the future course o-f interest rates

Mankiw and Summers [19841 looked at regressions of changes
in long rates on the long—short spread f or evidence for a

different notion of overreaction.. For them., overreaction occurs

if long—term bounds are priced in accordance with (3) but with

too short a duration, i e., with a duration less than implied by
the actual maturities and average levels o-f interest rates. They
pointed out that this sort o-f overreaction could never explain
the wrong sign of coefficient o-f the spread variable in

regressions like those in Table 6 herein contrast, the wrong sign o-f the coefficient of the spread

variable could in the recent sample periods instead be due to the
sort of underreaction defined above in that the long rate reacts
relatively too much to the past and too little to the current
short rate. In those cases where Zf3. z 1 the spread variable
tends to be high when short rates are low relative to their

average level over the preceding few years. If long rates were
to tend to increase subsequently, as the expectations model would
predict, then given the fact that long rates tend to behave like
a moving average of short rates, it would have to be the case
that the short rate tends to increase substantially at such a
time..

In fact it does riot..

An extreme caricature for the U.. S. data would be that the

long—term interest rate is a moving average of the short rate
with exponentially decaying weights that sum to one:

is the case, then the change in the long rate

equals (1—h)(R+1'> —

For this to be positively

correlated with the yield spread

it would have to be

the case that when the short rate is below the long rate (or-

equivalently below its recent average value as defined by the
moving average) it would have to tend to be above it the
following year

in factq the short rate is more persistent than

that and tends to stay on the same side of the long rate

The

caricature would be more realistic i-f we added a transient error

term (representing an exogenous drift of long rates unrelated to
short rates) to the above equation, another factor which would

tend to make for a wrong sign in the regression of the change in
the long rate on the spread_

It was shown in Shiller [1979] that the model (3) for n=w
implies that, for a given variance of ht there is a lower bound

be violated for g in the relevant range as is verified for all
of the data sets of this paper. Table 8.. Rejection a-f the

expectations model for violation o-F this inequality was

criticised by Flavin [1983] [1984] and others on the grounds that

small sample properties of the estimates of these variances may

be unreliable. This criticism of the use of this inequality is
certainly valid, especially with regard to more recent interest

rate data that seem mare likely to show nonstationarity.. The
violation of the variance equalities only show., as I originally

noted that the variability of changes in long—term interest
rates can only be reconciled with the expectations theory o-f

Conclusion

This paper began with the plausible notion that a
conventional valuation rule -for long term bands causes their
yields to behave as a sort a-f moving average of lagged short

rates. If people are relying on their memories to price bonds,.

then it is plausible that they would blur the pastq and that the
distributed lag would have a simple form, as the roughly
e>ponential decay form estimated here.. Whether this is an
overreaction or underreactian depends on the stochastic
properties of the shart—-term interest rate..

The sharpest contrasts are between the old historical data

and the most recent data. For the British data 1G28-193O
short rate seems to be quickly mean—reverting..

the

In this periods

it appears that the long—term interest rate overreacted somewhat
to short rates, and this caused excess volatility in long—term
interest rates.. With the recent U.. S.. data on the other hand

(whether the sample ends in 1979 or 194). there is not such
evidence a-F quick mean reversion in the short rate. One cannot

rule out either that there is substantial mean reversion or
alternatively that the aLltoreqressive forecasting equation has a

unjt root1 should be estimated in first—differenced form, that
short rates are unstationary and have no mean to revert to.

one

If

assumes that short rates are mean reverting, as many a-f the

estimated equations without the imposition a-f the unit root
suggest, then the long—rate appears to have overreacted to short
rates in all but the most recent sample period. If one makes the
it root assumptiort it appears that the long rate was not

excessivly volatile

relative to the expectations theory of the

term structure and in fact underreacted to short rates. There
was

underreactian in

the sense that the long rate should have

reacted relatively more to the current short rate than the past
short rates.

The tendency of lonq rates to rely too heavily on the past
rather

than current short rates accounts partly for the dramatic

failure of the slope o-F

the

term structure to predict changes in

ionQ—-term interest rates. ThLtS, for example, the term structure
tends to be
its

upward sloping when the short rate has dropped below

average value for the past -five or so years. Since the short

rate does not revert quickly above its average value over the
last five

or

years, the result

is that the long rate will be

The dramatic failure in U S. data of the slope of the term
structure to predict the direction o-f future interest rates is
not due only to the underreaction noted above. The failure is
also

due to a component n-f the long--term interest rate (one might

suppose it a "fads" or "Fashions"
"time—varying

The expectations theory.

however, is not completely without

value. The reaction of long—term interest

rates to

short term

interest rates appears to show some relation to the stochastic
properties o-f short rates. With the pre—depression British
series, the short rate appeared quickly mean—reverting and the

duration of the consol was much longer than with the other series

studied. Indeed the consol yield showed much less reaction to
short rates than did long yields in other periods. The notion
that bonds yields are determined strictly by some conventional

valuation formula without regard for the stochastic properties of
short rates is contradicted by these data

Instead, conventional

valuation seems to account for a bias in the behavior of long

rates relative to the expectations model, and does not alone
amount to a theory of the term structure.
