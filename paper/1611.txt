Aspects of Investor
Behavior Under Risk

ABSTRACT

The three sections of this paper support three related conclusions.

First, asset demands with the familiar properties of wealth homogeneity
and linearity in expected returns follow as close approximations from
expected utility maximizing behavior under the assumptions of constant
relative risk aversion and joint normally distributed asset returns.

Second, although such asset demands exhibit a symmetric coefficient matrix
with respect to the relevant vector of expected asset returns, symmetry is
not a general property, and the available empirical evidence warrants
rejecting it for both institutional and individual investors in the United

States. Finally, in a manner analogous to the finite maximum exhibited by
quadratic utility, a broad class of mean—variance utility functions also

exhibits a form of wealth satiation which necessarily restricts it

range

of applicability.

ASPECTS OF INVESTOR BEHAVIOR UNDER RISK

Benjamin

M. Friedman and V.

Vance Roley*

A greatly enhanced understanding of the nature of economic

uncertainty, and with it substantial insight into economic behavior in
circumstances under which uncertainty is central to necessary decisions, stand

as one of Kenneth Arrow's most significant contributions. His classic
lectures on zspects of the Theory of Risk-Bearing clarified key elements

of

the theory of choice under uncertainty, formalized crucial aspects of

risk—averse behavior, and explored the implications of the relevant theory

for such important economic activities as resource allocation and insurance.
These lectures, together with many of Arrow's other papers on risk
uncertainty,

and

and

have provided a foundation that is now standard in monetary

financial economics.

object of this paper is to analyze several aspects of the asset
demands characterizing investors' portfolio behavior under risk. Section I

especially in the monetary economics literature. The main result here is
that,

among the numerous familiar sets of specific assumptions sufficient

to derive mean—variance portfolio behavior from the more general theory

of expected utility maximization, the assumptions of constant relative risk
aversion and joint normally distributed asset return assessments are also

Section

II, however, provides empirical evidence that contradicts the

plausibility of these assumptions — and, for that matter, a variety of
others as well. In particular, a standard feature of asset demands, also
often simply assumed in applied research, is that the responses of these
demands

to expected asset returns are symmetric. The evidence summarized

here, based on the observed portfolio behavior of both institutional
and individual investors in the United States, casts doubt on the hypothesis
of symmetry and therefore also casts doubt on the set of more fundamental
assumptions that imply symmetry in this sense.
Section

III considers another aspect of investors' portfolio

behavior implied by a familiar group of utility functions. It is well known
that the quadratic utility function implies, a wealth satiation level, or

"bliss point." The analysis here shows that a number

of

other familiar

utility functions similarly exhibit wealth satiation when investors' behavior

is restricted only by the distribution of asset returns. This property
imposes still another important caveat in applications to the study of
investors' behavior based on such functions.
Section IV briefly summarizes the paper's principal conclusions.

I.

The Derivation

of Linear Homogeneous Asset

Demand Functions

The asset demand functions used for both analytical and empirical
research, especially in the monetary economics literature, are often assumed
to exhibit the two convenient properties of wealth homogeneity and linearity

in espected asset returns.' The convenience afforded by the tractability of
the linear form is apparent enough, and

the

wealth homogeneity property in

particular is often especially important in empirical applications to
aggregate

data.2 Despite the frequent use of such return—linear and wealth—

homogeneous asset demand functions, however, there exists (to the authors'

knowledge) no readily available source setting forth sufficient conditions
for the derivation, from underlying principles of expected utility maximization,
of asset demands simultaneously exhibiting both of these properties.3
The purpose of this section is to show that, among the numerous
familiar

sets of specific assumptions sufficient to derive mean—variance

portfolio behavior from more general expected utility maximization in

continuous time, the assumptions of (a) constant relative risk aversion
and (b)

joint normally distributed asset return assessments are also jointly

sufficient to derive as approximations, asset demand functions with the two

desirable

(and frequently simply assumed) properties of wealth homogeneity

and linearity in expected

returns. Constant relative risk aversion and

joint normally distributed asset return assessments are also sufficient
to yield such asset demands as approximations in discrete time if the time

unit is small.4

II. Evidence on the Symmetry

Imposition

10

Hypothesis

of symmetry restrictions on coefficients describing

responses to expected asset returns is a frequent practice in the empirical

estimation of systems of asset demands. Whoily apart from the theoretical
considerations laid out in Section I, a typical motive for imposing

in

symmetry

such applied research is simply to reduce the number of

independent coefficients to be estimated. In large systems of asset demands,
the corresponding gain in degrees of freedom is substantial. As is true
in the standard consumer demand paradigm, however, the coefficient matrix
applicable to the vector of expected asset returns consists of a combination
of

symmetric Slutsky substitution effects and (in general) asymmetric

Slutsky wealth effects.11

The analysis in Section I shows that in some specific cases the
relevant wealth terms do exhibit symmetry. The linear homogeneous asset

demands derived in Section I under constant relative risk aversion and

joint normal asset return distributions provide a clear

in terms of

example. Mare

expected utility functions that reduce to exact

mean—variance preference orderings, the symmetry

restriction

per se has

corresponding behavioral implications. In particular, when such a mean—
variance expected utility function has wealth as its

both cases the symmetry restriction implies that the Slutsky expected

wealth (or portfolio rate of return) effects are identically equal to zero,
leaving only a symmetric substitution matrix. By contrast, the symmetry

—11 —

property

does not follow from (for example) the quadratic utility function,

a form frequently encountered in the applied literature.
The symmetry property is therefore an empirically testable restriction.
It does not necessarily hold for any reasonable but arbitrarily chosen form

of expected utility maximizing behavior. Hence evidence indicating whether
investors' behavior does or does not exhibit symmetry provides potentially
useful information.

Evidence from Institutional Investors
Evidence based on the demands for two

maturity

classes of U.S.

Treasury securities by institutional investors in the United States

suggests that these investors' portfolio behavior does not exhibit symmetric

responses to nvements of asset returns. Table 1 summarizes this evidence
for six major categories of institutional investors in the U.S. markets,

including life insurance companies, other insurance companies, mutual savings
banks, savings and

loan

associations, private pension funds, and state and

local government retirement funds. The equations summarized in the table
are estimated using quarterly Federal Reserve data (seasonally adjusted)

for 1960-75. The data disaggregate the total financial asset holdings of
each investor group into asset classes such as corporate bonds, U.S.
Treasury securities, equities, commercial paper, mortgages, and currency
and demand deposits. The data further disaggregate each group's holding of

securities

U.S. Treasury

into four weighted maturity classes. The evidence

in the table focuses on each of the six investor groups' demands for two

1istinct

classes of Treasury securities: those with maturities ranging from

1/2 to

5 years

(S), and those with maturities over 10

years

(L).13

As is typical in empirical nxdels of financial asset demands, the
specific form of asset demand functions estimated here rest on the assumption

For each of the six investor groups, only two asset demands are

with or without the symmetry constraint. The subset of parameters relevant

precludes

such alternatives as full—information maximum likelihood or

three—stage least squares, a full—information technique is nevertheless

requircd to allow for contemporaneous error covariances in tests involving

Because there is substantial evidence that individual investors
do

not fully rebalance their portfolios within a time span as short as one

embed it within some model of portfolio adjustment out of equilibrium.

of applying nonlinear maximum likelihood estimation to (23), using data
for re as described above and Federal Reserve data on actual household

sector asset holdings for A (and hence W).24 These data are constructed
for each of the three assets by decrementing backward from the reported 1980
yearend value using the corresponding seasonally adjusted quarterly flows.25
In addition, for equities (the only one of the three assets for which the
asset stock data are at market value), quarterly valuation changes are

included without seasonal adjustment. The data for W include the three
financial assets only, in part to avoid inadequacies in the available data
describing holdings of and returns on nonfinancial assets, and in part simply

to limit the scope of the analysis. The data for W also omit the
household sector's outstanding liabilities, since the great bulk of
26

household borrowing is tied to the ownership of nonfinancial assets.
Because each term in (23) has the dimension of nominal dollars, care
is necessary to avoid spurious correlations due to cosunon time trends.

For purposes of estimation, therefore, the data for A (and hence W) are
rendered in real per capita values, using the consumer price index and

the total u.s. population series. In addition, both AA and W. exclude the

is x23) = 8.0, which warrants rejecting the restrictions at the .05 level.
Because the after—tax real returns on all three classes of financial

assets were serially correlated during the 1960-80

variation

of the observed returns used for re in

presumably

sample, tt unconditional

the estimation of these results

overstates the uncertainty that investors actually associated with

their expectations of asset returns, over each coming calendar quarter,
throughout this period.28 An alternative (and presumarly superior) way of

conducting such an analysis, therefore, is to construct some representation of

investors' perceptions of these asset returns and risks that takes more careful
account of what information investors did or did not have at any particular time.
As of the beginning of each calendar quarter, investors presumably

know the stated interest rates on short—term debt instruments, the current
prices and the coupon rates on long—term debt instruments, the current

prices and (approximately) the dividends on equities, and the relevant tax

rates. The three uncertain elements that they must
expectations

for the coming quarter of the after—tax real returns on the

three broad classes of
the

forecast in order to form

assets considered here are therefore inflation,

capital gain or loss on long-term debt, and the capital gain or

loss on equity.
Table 3

presents an alternative set of results based on a procedure

that infers investors' risk perceptions by representing investors as
forming expectations of these three uncertain return elements, at each

point

in time, by estimating a linear

vector autoregression model giving

the best linear projection of these elements from past values. In other
words, at the beginning of each period investors estimate the three—
variable vector autoregression using all then—available data (through the
immediately preceding period), and then use the estimated model to project
inflation and the respective capital gains on long-term debt and equity for

the period immediately ahead. After that period elapses, investors incorporate
into

the sample the new observation on the three random variables,

re—estimate the vector autoregression, and use the updated model to project
the relevant unknowns for the subsequent period.
This inherently backward—looking forecast procedure enjoys the
advantages

and suffers the shortcomings of expecting the immediate future

to be like the immediate past, so that the degree of success achieved by
the resulting one—period—ahead forecasts naturally varies according to the

extent of the serial correlation in the series being forecast. The first—
order serial correlation coefficients of the realizations of the three
random variables (again based on quarterly movements during 1960-80) are .90
for price inflation, .44 for long-term debt capital gains, and .31 for
equity

capital gains. The simple correlation coefficients between the

realizations and the corresponding forecasts derived from this continual updating
procedure

are .88 for inflation, .42 for long—term debt capital gains,

and .23 for equity capital gains.29 The simple correlation coefficients
between the realizations of after—tax real returns and the corresponding
forecasts are .83 for short—term debt, .51 for long—term debt, and .30
for equity.

Table

2,

continually updated return forecasts for r0. Here too, the resu

—19—

a

hardly

satihactory

in theoretical terms. The unconstrained estimates,

shown in the top panel of the table, still indicate a negative estimated
response of the demand for equity to the estimated return on equity.
More to the point here, two of the three pairs of off-diagonal estimated
responses have opposite signs.
The lower panel of Table 3 reports the corresponding results for

the same estimation subject to the further constraint that matrix B be
symmetric. Although imposition of the synutetry restriction is not strictly
inconsistent with the data in a statistical sense (the test statistic value

is x2()

= 2.65),

the constrained estimates are even less plausible than their

unconstrained counterparts. Here the estimated responses of all three asset
demands to their respective "own" expected returns are negative as they were
in Table 2. Moreover, all three asset pairs are now not substitutes but
complements. Although asset coinpiementarity is plausible enough in general,
in

this context there is nothing in the unconditional variance—covariance

structure of the three assets' returns, or in the conditional variance—covarjance

structure that results from the continually updated forecast procedure, to
suggest

complementarity among any of these three asset pairs.

For individual as well as institutional investors, therefore, the
available evidence suggests that asset demands exhibiting symmetry do not

describe the observed portfolio behavior. Given the connection between
symmetric asset demands and the specific assumptions underlying the

maximization of expected utility, these results therefore cast doubt on

the validity of standard assumptions often used —
implicitly

— to

either

explicitly or

characterize the behavior of risk averse investors.

—20—

III.

The "Bliss Point" problem
In both theoretical and empirical analyses of investor behavior under

risk, specific utility functions are

frequently

assumed to represent investors'

preferences. The most -analytically tractable and therefore most widely
used utility functions are those that reduce to preference orderings
over the mean and

variance

of wealth (or portfolio rate of return) under

uncertainty. Because quadratic utility reduces in a straightforward manner
to

such a mean-variance function for all probability distributions of

end-of-period wealth, it in particular is often applied to represent
investors' utility.30 The existence of a "bliss" (or wealth satiation)
point

in quadratic utility is widely acknowledged. In this case utility

has a finite maximum with a corresponding satiation level of end—of—period
wealth.

The possible existence of a different bliss point has also been

shown in mean—variance models. A sufficient condition for this other bliss
point to exist is that a riskless asset is not available and indifference

curves are convex in variance—mean space.31 The untenable implication of
this second bliss point is that a satiation level of beginning-of-period

wealth exists. In other words, there exist levels of initial wealth such
that an investor maximizes utility by disposing some of his wealth before
selecting his portfolio.

The existence and implications of initial wealth satiation have been

frequently misinterpreted. In particular, initial wealth satiation is
usually

interpreted as being the same as end—of—period wealth satiation in

quadratic utility.32 These bliss points are in fact distinct, however.
Indeed, in the quadratic utility case, initial wealth satiation occurs at
a lower level of expected utility than end-of-period wealth satiation.

—21--

Hence those researchers who have placed importance on restricting the range
of application of quadratic utility because of end-of-period wealth
satiation should logically have restricted its application still further

because of initial wealth satiation. Moreover, initial wealth satiation
limits the usefulness not only of quadratic utility but also of many other
common mean—variance utility functions.
I.io specific examples serve both to show the existence of initial

wealth satiation and to examine its consequences.33 These examples
involve quadratic utility and negative exponential utility with joint

normally distributed asset returns. Before considering these two

cases,

however, it is useful to define initial wealth satiation in more precise

terms. Initial wealth satiation is attained at initial wealth W if all
levels of initial wealth
if, given W. >

W,

<

W

yield lower mean-variance utility, and

an investor will maximize utility by disposing of

an amount of initial wealth equal to
sufficiently

is

-

W.

In other words, at

high levels of initial wealth, marginal mean-variance utility

negative with respect to increments of initial wealth. The implication

of this bliss point is therefore highly untenable, in that it is inconsistent
with a generally accepted norm of rational behavior.

Quadratic Utility

Perhaps the most interesting example of initial wealth satiation
involves quadratic utility

U(w+i) =

- bW1

(24)

where b is a positive scalar. while this utility function has been severely
criticized for displaying increasing absolute risk aversion, it nevertheless

—22—

is

the only von Neuinann—Morgenstern utility function that

exact

reduces to

an

mean—variance preference ordering for all probability distributions

of end-of—period wealth.34 The quadratic utility function also possesses
a global maximum

thereby implying the existence of a satiation level of end—of-period wealth.

wealth and on the parameters of the joint probability distribution of asset

equal to W. The well—known result that investors with convex indifference
curves

will always select efficient portfolios is readily apparent from

the parabolic curvature of the efficiency locus. With quadratic utility,

maximum mean-variance utility is obtained at [E(Wtl)*,var(Wt+i)*], with
expected utility U2, as illustrated in the figure.

To find the conditions that lead to initial wealth satiation,
the

level of invested wealth is then varied to form a family of efficiency

loci representing sets of feasible portfolios. The boundary of the set

of all possible portfolios, denoted as ctW] in Figure 1,
the

is given by

envelope of the efficiency loci, expressed as36

var(Wi) = E(W+1)2?(.2tr).

(29)

Each point on this boundary corresponds to a unique level of invested wealth.

To demonstrate that expected quadratic utility has
initial

a point of

wealth satiation, a finite solution to the maximization of (26)

subject to (29) must be found. The first- and second-order conditions

Consequently, a satiation level of initial wealth exists at W, and all

the quadratic utility case. The maximum possible level of expected utility
is

utility. Moreover, restrictions insuring W÷1 <

do not necessarily

Initial wealth must instead be restricted to be less

than W in order to circumvent the effective bliss point problem in the
quadratic utility model.

Negative

Exponential Utility with Joint-Normally Distributed Asset Returns

An expected utility model that also enjoys widespread use is derived
from the combined assunption of negative exponential utility
U(W1)

and joint normally distributed asset returns. One of the attractive
features of this specification is that absolute risk aversion is nondecreasing.
This model also exhibits increasing relative risk aversion.37
The

expected utility model consistent with these assumptions can be

shown to be maximized when the form

Figure 2 illustrates the initial wealth satiation point inherent in

this expected-utility model. The envelope of the efficiency loci and
indifference curves are labled as in Figure 1. This further example serves
to highlight the important fact that initial wealth satiation is an issue

unrelated to whether the utility function possesses an
unconstrained maximum, since U(+i) in (35) is inonotonically increasing in

These results suggest that other mean—variance utility models with

convex indifference curves in variance-mean space are also consistent with

initial wealth satiation. Inalogous satiation points also occur when
utility is specified over portfolio rate of return instead of end-of-period

wealth. Initial wealth satiation does not, however, occur either when the
utility

function is

logarithmic with lognormally distributed end-of-period

wealth, or when mean—variance utility is viewed as an arbitrarily close
approximation to expected utility with constant relative risk aversion.38
The presence of initial wealth satiation points in irany

utility functions does nevertheless limit the usefulness of these specific
sodels.

IV. Summary of Conclusions
Following the lead of Kenneth Arrow's significant contribution to
the theory of behavior under uncertainty, the development of the theory

of portfolio behavior has led to a greater understanding of the combined
effects of uncertainty and risk aversion on many aspects of individual
and institut-ional financial behavior. The focus of this paper is on aspects

of this theory involving the properties of investors' asset demands,
including in particular specific characteristics of asset demands that
in the monetary economics literature are often simply assumed and in the
financial literature are often ignored altogether in the consideration of
equilibrium asset returns.
The

three

sections of this paper support three related conclusions.

First, asset demands with the familiar properties of wealth homogeneity
and linearity in expected returns follow as close approximations from
expected utility maximizing behavior under the assumptions of constant
relative risk aversion and joint normally distributed asset returns.

Second, although such asset demands exhibit a symmetric coefficient matrix
with respect to the relevant vector of expected asset returns, symmetry is
not a general property, and the available empirical evidence warrants

rejecting it for both institutional and individual investors in the United

States. Finally, in a manner analogous to the finite maximum exhibited by
quadratic utility, a broad class of mean—variance utility functions also
exhibits a form of wealth satiation which necessarily restricts its range
of applicability.

alternative

view, however, see Goldfeld (1966, 1969).

3. Cass and Stiglitz (1970) showed that constant relative risk aversion
implies wealth homogeneity (and vice versa), but they did not consider

the form of dependence on expected returns in this context. A large
literature has investigated the conditions under which, in the presence
of a risk—free asset, the ex post demands for risky assets that emerge
from the market clearing process are linear in expected returns and
linear homogeneous with respect to the total amount invested in risky

only; see,for example, Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965), Hakansson
(1970), Cass and Stiglitz (1970) and Merton (1971). Nevertheless,

assets

these results do not apply to the ex ante demand relations that are
usually the focus of analysis in the monetary economics literature,
as exemplified by Tobin (1958). Moreover, these results dQ not
carry over in general to cases in which there is no risk—free asset;

and even when there is a risk—free asset the homogeneity is not with
respect to total wealth (as is usually assumed in the monetary economics
literature) and does not apply to the demand for the risk—free asset.

The rationale for mean—variance analysis provided by Samuelson (1970)
and Tsiang (1972) suggests that mean—variance analysis per se is only
an approximation that depends on (among other factors) a small time
unit.

Friend and Blume (1975)
(as

lines followed here

assumption

of constant relative risk aversion. See also, more

in conjunction with a given vector of asset supplies, will be capable
of determining all relative yields and all absolute yields but one.
See Brainard and Tobin (1968) and Smith (1975) for discussions of
empirical implementation of such asset demand systems in the specific
context of this singularity.

utility as a function of portfolio rate of return, with constant

"definite" areas and three "borderline" areas. The definite areas

corresponding to the two maturity classes examined here are 2 to 4
years and over 12 years to maturity. Securities with maturities in
the borderline areas — in this case securities with 1 to 2 years
and 8 to 12 years to maturity — are allocated to the definite
classifications according to a weighting scheme.

14. The basic notion behind the optimal marginal adjustment model is
that investors can allocate new investable flows AW less expensively
than

they can re—allocate assets already in their portfolios, and
that such flows will be allocated according to desired asset
proportions; see Friedman (1977).

Mditional asset demands are included in expanded versions of the
model; see Foley (1982).

Fair and Parke (1980). Under this procedure, the covariances of the

general nonzero, but the error covariances between equations of
different categories are constrained to equal zero.

The simple first-order serial correlation coefficients are
.86 for short—term debt, .51 for long-term debt, and .33 for
equity.

29. In comparing these "fit" correlations to the corresponding serial

correlations, it is helpful to recall that investors

did not

the 1960—80 serial correlation properties of these variables
until after this period had ended. The forecasting procedure
applied here uses only information that investors had at the
know

time they needed to make each quarter's forecast.

30. In fact, Borch (1969) proved that quathatic utility function is,
the only von Neumann-Morgenstern (1944) utility function that
induces nan—variance preferences for all probability distributions

of

end-of-period wealth.

31. Bierwag and Grove (1966) demonstrated that convexity of the

indifference curves is a sufficient condition. Jones and Poley
(1981) generalized this result and showed that some utility

functions with concave mean—variance indifference curves also have

bliss points,

32. Borch (1969) and Hakansson (1972), for example, interpreted the
result of Bierwag and Grove (1966) as implying that indifference
curves in standard deviation—mean space are concentric circles

with the point of highest utility represented by a single point at
the center. This bliss point corresponds to end-of-period wealth
satiation in quadratic utility. Bierwag and Grove (1966), however,

did not examine the case in which indifference curves in standard
deviation—mean space have this representation. Instead, they assumed
convex indifference curves in variance—mean space, and showed that this

assumption implies a preference ordering in asset space represented

by concentric circles. The center of these circles represents
the point of initial wealth satiation.
