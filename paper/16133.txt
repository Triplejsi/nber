Inequality and Infant and Childhood Mortality in the United States in the Twentieth Century
Michael R. Haines
NBER Working Paper No. 16133
June 2010
JEL No. I1,N12
ABSTRACT
This paper deals with the issue of using infant and childhood mortality as an indicator of inequality.
The case is that of the United States in the 20th century. Using microdata from the 1900 and 1910
Integrated Public Use Microsamples (IPUMS), published data from the Birth Registration Area in
the 1920s, results from a number of surveys, and the Linked Birth & Infant Death Files from the National
Center for Health Statistics for 1991, infant and child mortality can be related to such other variables
as occupation of father or mother, education of father or mother, family income, race, ethnicity, and
residence. The evidence shows that, although there have been large absolute reductions in the levelRI
infant and child mortality rates and also a reduction in the absolute levels of differences across socioeconomic
groups, relative inequality has not diminished over the 20th century.

INTRODUCTION
The issue of inequality has been, and remains, a central concern for social
science and public policy.

For instance, despite dramatic increases in income,

wealth, and standard of living in developed, industrial nations, segments of the
populations in those nations have remained disadvantaged.

In the United States, the

real consumption wage remained relatively stagnant from the mid 1980s to the mid
1990s.

Real median family and individual incomes were stagnant or declining over that

period [Council of Economic Advisers, 1996, pp. 61, 314].

Tha share of money income

going to the top 5% of households increased from 15.8% in 180 to 21.4% in 1998.
[Carter, et al., 2006, Table Be 1-18].

Some nations and regions in the developing

world have stagnated or even experienced deterioration of living standards [United
Nations, 1999, pp. 37-41].

In the study of inequality and distribution, the focus has

often been on inputs, such as income, although the historical statistics on income
distribution are considered quite deficient [Kuznets, 1966, ch. 4].

Nevertheless, it

is often better to focus rather on outcomes, such as health and mortality.

This is

the essence of the World Bank’s Basic Needs Indicators [Hicks and Streeten, 1975],
which include such things as nutrition, health, housing, sanitation, and education.1
The expectation of life at birth and the infant mortality rate are among the measures
used.

Some of the more frequently used development indicators include similar outcome

variables, notably demographic ones.

The Physical Quality of Life Index [Overseas

Development Council, 1979] uses the expectation of life at age one, the infant
mortality rate, and the literacy rate.

The Human Development Index of the United

Nations Development Program [United Nations, 1994, ch. 5] includes the expectation of
life at birth (which is heavily influenced by the infant mortality rate), adult
literacy, mean years of schooling, and real GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing
power parity.
The infant mortality rate has frequently been used as a social indicator.

Sor,

for example, Sir Arthur Newsholme in Britain wrote in 1910: “Infant Mortality is the
most sensitive index we possess of social welfare and of sanitary administration,
especially under urban conditions” [cited in Titmuss, 1943, p. 12].
Quality of Life Index uses the IMR explicitly.

The Physical

In the United States, early efforts by

the Children’s Bureau focused on collection of demographic statistics and studies of

productivity.

infant mortality [Lindenmeyer, 1997, ch. 3; Woodbury, 1926; Bremner, 1971, pp. 958965; Meckel, 1990, ch. 4].
In this paper an effort is made to trace trends in inequality over the 20th century
in the United States using infant and childhood mortality as a social indicator of an
important outcome.2

At various points, appeal is made to social class.

This complex

concept can be made measurable in a variety of ways: by occupation, by income, by
wealth and property, by education (human capital), by residence.

Some use is made of

all these dimensions, although, at basis, the issue is really one of “life chances”.
[Weber, 1963 [1920]; Dahrendorf, 1979].
TRENDS IN INEQUALITY IN INFANT MORTALITY IN THE UNITED STATES: the 1890S to the 1990s
The starting point for this study is the United States Census of 1900, which asked
questions on the number of children ever born, the number of children surviving, and
the duration of current marriage of married, adult women.3

Nothing was ever tabulated

from those questions, but a public use microsample (of about 100,000 individuals) has
been created which permits use of these data.

This census has been used by Preston

and Haines [Preston and Haines, 1991; Haines and Preston, 1997] to make estimates of
childhood mortality.

The methodology of indirect estimation is described in detail

elsewhere [United Nations, 1983, ch. III; Preston and Haines, 1991, ch. 2; Haines and
Preston, 1997].

The same techniques were also applied to the microsample of the 1910

United States Census (of about 366,000 individuals) which also asked the same
questions [Preston, Ewbank, and Hereward, 1994; Haines and Preston, 1997].

The

fundamental intuition is that the proportion of children dead for a certain age group
or marriage duration group of women can be adjusted with a model to yield a life table
parameter, namely q(x), which is the proportion of children dying before reaching
exact age “x”.

The “x” depends on the age or duration group of women.

Each of these

estimated q(x) values can also be dated to a specific point in time prior to the
census date.

A great advantage of this method is that it allows tabulation of

mortality differentials by characteristics of the parents – in this case occupation of
father.
The starting point is the federal censuses of 1900 and 1910 (Tables 1 and 2).
Child mortality is summarized in these tables as a mortality index.

The index is

States, see Williamson and Lindert [1980].

These questions had been asked before in 1890, but nothing was tabulated
using these questions and the manuscripts of that census were largely destroyed.

approximately 1.0 for all women in the sample at each date.

An index value below one

indicates lower than average childhood mortality of that group of women, while an
index value above one points to the opposite.

In both tables the sample is restricted

to women aged 14 to 49 who were married 0-24 years, once married with husband present,
and for whom children ever born and children surviving were known.4

This resulted in a

total sample of 12,624 women with 23,073 children ever born in 1900 and 39,305 women
with 61,636 children ever born in 1910.

The mortality index itself is calculated at

the ratio of actual children dead (computed as the difference of children ever born
and children surviving) to expected children dead for each group of women.

Expected

children dead is calculated by multiplying the children ever born in each marriage
duration group (0-4 years, 5-9 years,...,20-24 years) by the expected proportion dead
for that marriage duration group using the Trussell/United Nations model and the Coale
and Demeny [1966] Model West life tables [see United Nations, 1983, ch. III; Haines
and Preston, 1997, Table A1].

For 1900, the West Model life table chosen for the

standard was level 13 for both sexes combined, and for 1910 it was level 13.5.

The

results for 1900 apply approximately to the year 1895 and those for 1910 to
approximately to the year 1904.
Husband’s occupation is used as an indicator of social status for the 1900 and
1910 census estimates.

The detailed occupations were organized into the tenfold

classification of the 1950 United States Census.5

For the black population, relatively

few cases were found in the higher socioeconomic status groups, so that Professional
and Technical; Managers, Officials, and Proprietors; Clerical; and Sales were combined
together.

In general, the least well of groups (usually non-farm laborers) had

childhood mortality 40-100% higher than the most favored groups.

The baseline in the

last three columns was set at 100 for the Professional and Technical group, but
farmers (agricultural except laborers), clerical and sales often did better in 1900.
This was usually not true in 1910.

Inequality across occupational groups in childhood

mortality was mostly great among foreign-born whites and among blacks than among
native-born whites.

A rural-urban breakdown is also provided in Tables 1 and 2.

In

1900, inequality was usually worse in urban areas than in rural places, but the effect
was not pronounced.

This had changed a bit by 1910 – urban areas were still worse off

for foreign-born whites and blacks but not for native-white women.
The next point in the twentieth century for which national level data are
available is the 1920s.

During that period, the United States Bureau of the Census,

which had the responsibility for collecting vital statistics from state and local
governments and for published them, was tabulating statistics on births, children ever
born, children surviving, and number of women by age of woman and detailed occupation
of husband for the Birth Registration Area.
vital statistics reporting until 1933.

The entire nation was not covered by

Prior to that, a Death Registration Area

(1900-1932) and a Birth Registration Area (1915-1932) were gradually built up to the
national system by incorporating only those states and cities which had vital
statistics collection which met certain minimum standards.

These birth data are

reported for 1924 in Table 3 and for 1929 in Table 4 [U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1926,
Table 10; 1932, Table 10].6
the American population.
Table Ab1-37].

In 1924, the Birth Registration area covered about 76% of

The coverage was at about 95% in 1929 [Carter, et al., 2006,

The detailed occupations of husband from the birth and infant

mortality statistics volumes were re-aggregated into the same 1950 U.S. Census
groupings as used for 1900 and 1910.

While the published tables did not cover all

occupations of husband, they did encompass 90.9% of all registered births in 1924 and
91.6% in 1929.

The Trussell/United Nations age model of indirect child mortality

estimation was applied to calculate q(2) (the probability of dying before reaching
exact age 2) based on women aged 20-24 years and q(5) (the probability of dying before
reaching exact age 5) based on women aged 30-34 years [United Nations, 1983, pp. 7681].

The estimates for 1924 apply to about the year 1919 for q(2) and to

approximately 1916-1917 for q(5).

Similarly, the dating was approximately 1924 for

the q(2) calculated from the 1929 data and about 1921-1922 for the q(5) from the 1929
information.

No breakdown by nativity, race, or residence was available.

Looking at the results in Tables 3 and 4, inequality in the 1920s was, if
anything, worse than it had been in 1900 and 1910.

Interestingly, farmers and

agricultural laborers no longer enjoyed a favorable situation with respect to child
mortality.

The health advantage of rural residence was disappearing as the urban

mortality penalty was being eliminated [see Haines, 1999].

By the 1920s many cities

were healthier than surrounding rural areas, especially because of more rapid and
extensive improvements in urban water supplies, sewerage disposal, food and milk

protection, and other aspects of public health.

The 1920s were also a decade of

worsening income and wealth distribution in general [Williamson and Lindert, 1980, pp.
75-82].

The mortality gradients in the 1920s were now more regular with Professional

and Technical have the lowest child mortality, passing up through Clerical, Sales, and
Managers-Officials-Proprietors and finally up through skilled manual workers,
operatives, and both farm and non-farm laborers.

By 1929, non-farm laborers now had a

q(5) level two to three times as high as that for women with husbands having
professional or technical occupations.
During that same era, the Children’s Bureau came into existence (1912)
[Lindenmeyer, 1997].
mortality.

One of its first efforts was to undertake studies of infant

Over the period 1912 to 1915, eight cities were studied (Johnstown, PA;

Manchester, NH; New Bedford, MA; Waterbury, CT; Akron, OH; Saginaw, MI; Brockton, MA;
and Baltimore, MD) and samples were taken totaling 22,967 live births and 2,555 infant
deaths.

The infant deaths were matched to the birth certificates, and the birth

certificates were traced to the families who were, in turn, interviewed.
were summarized later by Woodbury [1926].

The results

These were extraordinary studies in that

elicited information on breast feeding, income, and birth intervals, as well as the
standard demographic information (e.g., age, race, nativity, family relationships).
Selected results are given in Table 5.

There was a clear gradient from low to high

incomes with the highest infant mortality rate occurring in families with the husband
reporting no earnings.

The penalty for having a male family head without work was

tragic – it raised the infant mortality rate by 357% over the highest income group
($1,250 and over).

The risk of having a child death was decreased by 26% by just

moving into the lowest income category ($450 and below).

This accords with the

finding of Preston and Haines [1991, chs. 3 and 4, especially tables 3.1 and 4.1] for
the 1900 census that unemployment of the husband had a consistent and considerable
negative impact on child survival.

If the husband reported some unemployment in the

year prior to the census, it raised the mortality index by about 26% (and by about 16%
when controlling for a number of other variables).

In the 1912-15 surveys, at any

given income level, native white women usually did better than foreign-born white
women, but not consistently so and not by too much.

Tabulations by income show that

both blacks and foreign-born whites had higher infant mortality rates because they
were, on average, poorer than native whites.

Nevertheless, the lower panels of Table

5 show that breast feeding could make a difference for some groups.

Ethnic groups

with a higher incidence of breast feeding (e.g., Italian, Polish, and Jewish women)
5

but with a higher proportion of lower income families (percent with incomes below
$650) did better in terms of child survival than did similar groups with a low
incidence of breast feeding (e.g., Portuguese women).

Even groups with higher income

but a lower incidence of breast feeding (e.g., German, French Canadian, and native
white women) did not fare as well as income would suggest.
Two additional tables (7 and 8) provide results for the 1950s and 1960s.

Table 6

presents data for single births to white mothers in New York State in 1950-1952.

They

are organized by the standard 1950 U.S. Census categories of husband’s occupation.
The results are both unadjusted and adjusted for birth weight and age of mother.

They

are also tabulated for different ages at death fetal, infant (0-365 days), neonatal
(0-27 days), and post-neonatal (28-365 days).

The gradients for the infant mortality

rate by socioeconomic group are now smaller than previously, and they are also quite
regular.

The differences between the highest and the lowest groups are considerably

smaller – about 60% for infant mortality and 33% for neonatal mortality.

The

differences are largest for the post-neonatal period when the influence of
environmental circumstances is much more likely to affect the outcome.
Table 7 gives some data from the large matched birth and infant death study
undertaken for the period 1964-1966 by the National Center for Health Statistics [see
MacMahon, Kovar, and Feldman, 1972].

In this case, education of the father is used as

the indicator of socioeconomic status., since birth and death certificates did not
report occupation of the father.

They still do not report that useful piece of

information [NCHS, 1995, Section 4, pp. 1-3; NCHS, 1996a, Section 7, pp. 2-5].

By the

1960s, infant mortality rates had fallen considerably – from about 100 infant deaths
per 1,000 live births for the Birth Registration Area in 1915, to about 72 for the
Birth Registration Area in 1925, to about 56 in 1935, 34 in 1945, 26 in 1955 and 25 in
1965 (and 21 for the white population) [Carter, et al. 2006, Table Ab912-927].

But

differentials by education and socioeconomic status were still considerable: a 78%
penalty for women with husband’s with 8 or fewer years of education relative to women
with husbands with a college education or more.

The penalty was 49% for neonatal

mortality and 303% for post-neonatal mortality.
A similar study can be undertaken for the United states for a later period.

The

National Center for Health Statistics has been releasing the data from the “Linked
Birth/Infant Death Studies” for birth cohorts from 1985 onwards.

The results are

reported by race (using the 1990 Office of Management and Budget categories) and for
infant, neonatal, and post-neonatal mortality rates.

The gradients are still present,

despite the drop in the overall infant mortality rate to 8.6 per 1,000 live births
(7.0 for whites and 16.6 for blacks).

Those with no formal education had infant

mortality rates over twice as high as those who had some graduate education.

The

differences were also again larger for post neonatal mortality, though not
dramatically so.

It is unrealistic, however, to look at those results.

Couples with

a husband having no formal education contributed only .7% of all births in the United
States in 1991.

The results are less dramatic for husband’s with 1-7 years and with

completed primary education (8 years of schooling).

Quite large differences appear

across racial and ethnic categories: Whites and Asian/Pacific Islanders do well.
Blacks and American Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts do poorly.
gradients within groups remain and look similar.

The socioeconomic status

It is the concentration of blacks

and Amerindians in low educational categories that relegates them to this harsh
mortality penalty.
CONCLUDING COMMENTS
The studies and data sets surveyed in this paper are summarized in Table 9.
Several additional studies (taken from Antonovsky and Bernstein [1977]) are also
reported.

The mortality ratios are the common measure, which give the ratio of the

mortality rate for infants or children for the lowest socioeconomic status group to
the mortality rate for the highest socioeconomic status group.

The table shows some

tendency for inequality to worsen from the 1890s to the 1920s.

There was likely some

improvement from the 1930s to the 1950s, in parallel with a general improvement in
income distribution [Williamson and Lindert, 1980, pp. 82-94].

But differentials seem

to have opened again, despite the overall decline in infant and child mortality.
Social status gradients in infant mortality continue to exist and to be relatively
large in relative terms (though now much smaller in absolute terms).

There is

currently a 50% to 150% penalty in infant mortality for being in the lowest

This is

It also holds for

the Hispanic population (both white and nonwhite), although that group is not analyzed
here.

The Asian/Pacific Islander population as a whole does not suffer from this

mortality penalty.

On two counts, the U.S. lags many other developed nations -- the

level of health and medical care provided to the poor, and the standard of living of
the poor.

In 2005, the United States ranked 42nd in the world in infant mortality.

But even if all Americans has the same infant mortality rate as the white population
(5.7), the United States would still only be tied for 38th place [U.S. Bureau of the
Census, 2008, Table 1295].

A wealthy and technologically advanced society surely can

As Antonovsky and Bernstein [1977, p. 459] note: “Low social

class per se does not cause high infant mortality...however,...social class does
subsume a large set of more directly causative biological and behavioral variables.”
Some of those causative variables may be amenable to direct policy intervention (e.g.,
universal child immunization programs), but some may be address by more general
improvements in the living standards of the society, particularly among its poor.
