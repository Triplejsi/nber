The Construction of Life Tables for the American Indian Population at the Turn of the Twentieth
Century

JEL No. I1,I3,N11
ABSTRACT
This paper constructs new life tables for the American Indian population in the late nineteenth and
early nineteenth centuries, thus pushing back the availability of age-specific mortality and life expectancy
estimates nearly half a century. Because of the lack of reliable vital registration data for the American
Indian population in this period, the life tables are constructed using indirect census-based estimation
methods. Infant and child mortality rates are estimated from the number of children ever born and
children surviving reported by women in the 1900 and 1910 Indian censuses. Adult mortality rates
are inferred from the infant and child mortality estimates using model life tables. Adult mortality rates
are also estimated by applying the Preston-Bennett two-census method (1983) to the 1900-1910 intercensal
period.

“The Construction of Life Tables for the American Indian Population at the Turn of the
Twentieth Century”
Substantial qualitative evidence indicates that the American Indian population of the
United States suffered high mortality in the five centuries after contact with European
populations (Thornton 2000). Comprehensive and reliable age-specific mortality data, however,
are not available until after 1955, when the U.S. Public Health Services assumed responsibility
for Indian healthcare (Shoemaker 1999: 8). Rough estimates of life expectancy before that date
suggest very high mortality. In 1940, American Indian life expectancy at birth for both sexes
combined is estimated to have been 51.6 years, 12.6 years lower than that of the white
population and 1.5 years lower than that the black population. Infant mortality rates in 1944 are
estimated to have been 135 per thousand, approximately three times higher than that of other
races (Snipp 2006: 1-746; 1-744).
This paper constructs new life tables for the American Indian population in the late
nineteenth and early nineteenth centuries, thus pushing back the availability of age-specific
mortality and life expectancy estimates nearly half a century. Because of the lack of reliable vital
registration data for the American Indian population in this period, the life tables are constructed
using indirect census-based estimation methods. Infant and child mortality rates are estimated
from the number of children ever born and children surviving reported by women in the 1900
and 1910 Indian censuses. Adult mortality rates are inferred from the infant and child mortality
estimates using model life tables. Adult mortality rates are also estimated by applying the
Preston-Bennett two-census method (1983) to the 1900-1910 intercensal period.
As other papers in this collection have emphasized, there is a complex relationship
between aboriginal identity, its measurement in demographic sources, and demographic

1

analyses. Although no other source on the American Indian population at the turn of twentieth
century approaches the richness and comprehensiveness of the American Indian censuses,
potential problems in the enumeration likely bias the estimation of mortality. As discussed
below, age and marital duration reporting errors in the American Indian census likely imparts
substantial bias in mortality estimates derived from both surviving children and two census
methods. In addition, the difficulties in defining individuals as belonging to an American Indian
“race” presents a major challenge to the estimation of mortality with two census methods, which
assumes that the American Indian population was closed to migration. Federal assimilation
policy strongly encouraged American Indians to assimilate in the general population, where they
were less likely to be identified as Indian. Thus individuals descended in whole or part from the
pre-contact Indian populations of North America may have “migrated” across racial categories
between the two censuses.
The 1890, 1900, and 1910 Indian Censuses
The enumeration of American Indians on special forms in the 1890, 1900, and 1910 censuses
grew out of aspirations of the U.S. federal government to better manage the nation’s Indian
population and to measure the impact of its assimilation policies (Jobe 2004). Neither a
complete count of American Indians nor an enumeration of their social, economic, nor
demographic characteristics was required. Although the U.S. Constitution mandated a census
every ten years to apportion representatives in Congress, it specifically noted that only “Taxed”
Indians (i.e., Indians severing tribal relations and living among the general population) counted
towards congressional representation. As a result, the vast majority of Indians living in the

2

United States before 1890 were not enumerated by a census.1 It was not until the 1940s that all
Indians were considered “taxed” and routinely enumerated (U.S. Bureau of the Census, p. 1).
The first attempt to truly count and collect demographic information for all Indians of the
United States was made with the 1890 census. Of the total 248,253 Indians enumerated, 58,806
were “Indians taxed” and 189,447 were “Indians not taxed.” As in earlier censuses,
distinguishing between “tax” and “non-tax” Indians proved difficult. According to the census
report:
Indians taxed and Indians not taxed are terms that cannot be rigidly interpreted, as Indian
citizens, like white citizens, frequently have nothing to tax. Indians subject to tax and
Indians not subject to tax might more clearly express the distinction. Indians taxed have
so far become assimilated in the general population that they are not exempt from tax by
reason of being Indians. Indians not taxed are remnants of uncivilized tribes or bodies of
Indians untaxed by reason of specific treaties or laws controlling their relation to the
national government, as the Six Nations of New York and the Five Civilized Tribes of
Indian Territory (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1894, p. 131).2
A more difficult problem for the Census Bureau and other federal agencies was defining
who was an “Indian” and what defined membership in a tribe. Prior to the nineteenth century,
most tribes adhered to a kinship model in which biological children and individuals marrying or
adopted by a member of the tribe were considered members or citizens of the tribe. During the
nineteenth century, however, the federal government increasingly relied on a race-based
1

The Bureau of Indian Affairs collected various data on the Indian population in the nineteenth century, but the
coverage and quality of these data varies enormously (Jones, 2004). Various attempts to count the number of Indians
were made in earlier censuses, but relied on a large number of estimates. Of the 383,712 Indians reported by the
1870 Census to be living in the United States, for example, more than 68% were estimated (Thornton, 1987: 212-3).
2
See also the comments of Francis A. Walker, Superintendent of the Census of 1870, who complained about “the
absence of any constitutional, legal, or judicial definition of the phrase ‘Indians not taxed’ within the Constitution or
the census law of 1850. (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1872, p. xvi).

definition that focused on individual’s degree of “Indian blood.” In United States v. Rogers
(1846), for example, the U. S. Supreme Court ruled that a white person living in the Cherokee
territory and married to a Cherokee tribal member—though considered a citizen of the Cherokee
Nation by tribal law—was not an Indian for jurisdictional purposes. Passage of the General
Allotment Act (1887) furthered the move towards a blood quantum definition of Indian identity.
To implement the policy, Congress passed an Act in 1894 that gave Indians denied an allotment
the ability to file a federal lawsuit, provided that the person was “in whole or in part of Indian
blood or descent.” Federally-imposed racial definitions eventually were adopted by Indian tribes.
Today, most tribe memberships have an explicit blood quantum standard (Spruhan 2006).
The 1890, 1900, and 1910 censuses were thus taken during a period of changing
definition of “Indian.” In practice, the census definition was based on enumerator observation
and respondent answer, leading to problems of identification. As the 1890 census report noted,
“Enumeration would be likely to pass by many who had been identified all their lives with the
localities where found, and who lived like the adjacent whites without any inquiry as to their
race, entering them as native born whites” (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1894, p. 131). According
to the same report, some non-Indians were likely to be counted as Indians: “One the other hand,
certain legal and proprietary claims lead persons of very slight Indian blood connections, or even
pure whites by birth, to call themselves Indians by heredity or acquired right, and there are those
of pure white blood who wish to be called Indians, in order to share in pecuniary advantages,
who are not acknowledged by any tribes” (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1894, p. 131).
The inclusion of a special census question in the 1900 and 1910 censuses on individual’s
proportion of “Indian blood” reflects the growing emphasis on blood quantum by the federal
government and an attempt to avoid some of the ambiguity of defining an Indian. The 1910

4

census report on American Indians, for example, noted that “all persons of mixed white and
Indian blood who have any appreciable amount of Indian blood are counted as Indians, even
though that proportion of white blood may exceed that of Indian blood” (U.S. Census Bureau,
1915: 10). Figure 1, which plots the mean per centage of Indian blood by birth cohort in the 1900
and 1910 Indian Census IPUMS samples, suggests that the new emphasis led to a greater number
of individuals of mixed decent being counted as Indian in the 1910 census.3
<Place Figure 1 about here>
In addition to the Census Office’s acknowledged difficulties measuring race and tax
status, Nancy Shoemaker contends that cultural differences between enumerators and Indians
created special challenges for the 1890, 1900, and 1910 census enumerations. Family structure
varied tremendously among tribes and was often at odds with the patriarchal family structure
dominant among enumerators. In many Indian societies, “fathers,” “mothers,” and other
indentified kin were equivalent to what Euro Americans would call aunts, uncles, unrelated
individuals, or “fictive kin.” Although Shoemaker suspects that most Indians and enumerators
recognized these cultural differences and accounted for them on the census forms, we cannot be
entirely certain. Indians may have also been reticent to share some information with the federal
government. Indian parents concerned about the possibility of losing their children to
government-run boarding schools had a potential incentive to hide children. Parents whose
children were eligible for allotments, on the other hand, might have counted deceased children
and pregnancies in the hope of acquiring additional acreage (Shoemaker 1992). In addition to
challenges noted by Shoemaker, we should also note that the Census Bureau took a dim view of
the quality of many of the questions unique to the 1910 Indian enumeration. “Inquires were also
3

A greater tendency to report non-Indian ancestors and differential mortality among the population counted as
Indian in 1900 may also play some role. Hacker and Haines (2006) document much lower infant and childhood
mortality among Indians reporting higher per centages of white blood in 1900.

made on the special Indian schedule as to graduation from educational institutions, allotments,
residence on own lands, and whether living in civilized or aboriginal dwellings,” noted the
Bureau’s report on the 1910 enumeration, “but the answers were so deficient or manifestly
inaccurate as to render the results of little or no value” (U.S. Census Bureau, 1915: 9).
Despite these problems, we have no other source on the American Indian population
comparable in coverage and scope to the 1900 and 1910 censuses. For the most part,
enumerators were chosen for their familiarity with particular tribes and appear to have been
diligent in their effort (Johansson and Preston 1978, Shoemaker 1992). In her study of five
Indian tribes in 1900, Shoemaker noted that enumerators were usually mixed-blood Indians,
white men married to Indian women, or employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs who were
familiar with the language and the culture of the groups they enumerated, thus minimizing the
potential for misunderstandings and error (1999: 108).
The 1900 and 1910 American Indian IPUMS Samples
Although the Census Bureau collected data in 1890, 1900, and 1910, it lacked the necessary
funds to analyze the 1900 data. The Bureau was able to publish brief analyses of the 1890 and
1910 data, but like other census publications of the era included only a few dozen cross
tabulations. The creation of microdata samples from the original returns allows the analysis of
data in a much more sophisticated way. Unfortunately, the original manuscript returns of the
1890 census were destroyed in a fire. The 1900 and 1910 censuses are thus the first surviving
census to enumerate all American Indians in a systematic manner. These returns were sampled
and transcribed at the Minnesota Population Center, coded, and released to the public on the
IPUMS website between 2005 and 2007 (Ruggles et al. 2004).

The 1900 and 1910 Indian IPUMS samples are 1-in-5 samples of all households in the
Indian Census. Indians living outside of reservations among the general population—
approximately 6 per cent of the total number of Indians in 1900 and 7 per cent in 1910—were
enumerated in the regular census schedules and are not included in the high density Indian
sample.4 Indians enumerated in the general census can be found in the regular 1900 and 1910
IPUMS samples, which are one per cent density samples. (These individuals can be weighted
appropriately and added to the high density sample to conduct analyses requiring the complete
population, such as two-census mortality estimation.) The 1900 high-density Indian sample
includes 45,651 individuals identified as members of 226 unique tribal groups. The 1910 sample
includes 48,724 individuals in 225 unique tribes.
The diversity of the American Indian population is not easily summarized. Table 1
tabulates the samples by sex, year, and major tribal group, a classification scheme used by the
1990 Census and the IPUMS project.5 The Cherokee and Sioux Nations had the most members
in both census years, each representing about 11 per cent of sampled population in 1900. There
was a noticeable drop in the number of Sioux in 1910 relative to other groups, however, perhaps
reflecting sampling variability, changes in census coverage, or differential fertility and mortality.

Constructing Life Tables Using Information on Child Survivorship
Demographers have developed indirect methods of fertility and mortality estimation for
populations with poor or nonexistent vital registration systems. One of the most commonly used

Indians enumerated in the general census can be found in the regular 1900 and 1910 IPUMS samples, which are
one per cent density samples. Unfortunately, at this density there are too few Indians for most analyses.

For example, the classification scheme considers individuals identified as “Apache,” “Jicarilla Apache,” “Lipan
Apache,” “Mescalero Apache,” “Payson Apache,” and “White Mountain Apache” as members of the general group
“Apache.”Although culturally related and all located in the American Southwest, the various Apache groups speak
different, though related languages.

indirect methods is the Brass method (1975) for estimating child mortality from census or survey
data on child survivorship (United Nations 1983: ch. 3; Preston, Heuveline and Guillot 2001:
224-255). The method requires questions on the number of live births that an ever-married
woman had in her life (i.e. parity or children ever born) and how many of those children were
still living (i.e. children surviving). Fortunately, these questions were included in the 1900 and
1910 censuses (Preston and Haines, 1991; Haines and Preston, 1997).
The Brass method transforms the proportion of children dead among women of different
age or marriage duration categories into a standard life table parameter, qx, the proportion of
children dying before reaching age “x.” The exposure of children to the risk of dying can be
proxied with three different approaches. The “age model” uses women’s age, the “duration
model” uses women’s marriage duration, and the “surviving children” method uses ages of the
surviving children Very roughly, for example, the proportion of children dead among women age
20-24 and women married 10-15 years corresponds to the proportion of children dying before
age 5. Adjustments are made for the age-specific marital duration specific fertility schedules.
Unfortunately, the estimating procedure for the child surviving method would not converge on a
solution in the computer program designed for the approach for the American Indian population.
The cause is likely age misstatement among children. Results are thus reported only for the age
and marital duration models.
Age misstatement appears to have been common in the American Indian census among
adults as well. Figures 2 and 3 suggest a much higher level of age and marital duration “heaping”
problems in the Indian population than in the nation’s native-born white population. Ages and
marriage durations for the American Indian population ending in a 5 or 0 (e.g., ages 40, 45, 50,
etc.) are clearly over-reported, while ages and marital durations ending in other digits are under-

8

reported. There are, for example, approximately 3 times as many American Indians age 40 as
there are at age 39 or 40. If age heaping errors are small random rounding errors (i.e.., true ages
are normally and tightly distributed about the reported age), the resulting bias in indirect
mortality estimates will be modest. Nancy Shoemaker has estimated life expectancy of five
selected Indian tribes in 1900 with alternative age categories (e.g., age 38-42, 43-47, etc.) and
found very small differences in the results (Shoemaker 1999). If the rounding is systematic (e.g.,
an increasing tendency to round true ages up with increasing age), however, the bias will be
more severe.

The results from indirect child mortality estimation methods applied to the original 1900
and 1910 IPUMS samples and to the new 1900 and 1910 American Indian IPUMS samples are
given in Tables 2 and 3. The sample universe includes currently married women in the 1900 and
1910 Indian censuses with spouse present and valid age, martial duration, children ever born, and
children surviving data. The 1910 sample is further restricted to women in their first marriage (a
question on the number of times each married individual had been married was added in the
1910 census). The tables show the corresponding qx value for each age and marriage duration
category, the number of children ever born used to make the estimate, the relevant date in the
past to which the estimate applies and the expectation of life at birth, e0, indicated by that level of
child mortality in the West Model life table system. The West Model was chosen because it fit
the American experience in 1900 very well (Preston and Haines, 1991, ch. 2).

Figure 4 plots the implied model west life expectancies by method of construction,
census sample, and date to which each estimate applies. Most estimates are between 35 and 45
years. Estimates made with the 1910 census sample using the age and duration methods closely
correspond. Those made with the 1900 sample, however, do not. The likely reason is the lack of
information on remarriage in 1900. When mortality is high, as it was in the American Indian
population, there is a good deal of widowhood and potential remarriage of widows. Thus older
women who have had more children and a longer period of exposure to risk of child death would
be included in the shorter marriage durations. This problem was largely eliminated in 1910 by
limiting the sample to women in their first marriage. A partial solution for the problem in the
1900 duration model was to select women who were younger than age 35 at the estimated time
of marriage (age minus duration of current marriage), which is why estimates of the longer
marriage durations are not included in Table 2.6
<Place Figure 4 about here>
The 1900 age model and the 1910 age and marital duration models suggest rapid trends
towards higher life expectancies in the years preceding the census. Although mortality was
falling for the white population (Preston and Haines, 1991), there are several reasons to be
skeptical of the American Indian results. First, the estimates rise very rapidly, approximately 10
years in the then years prior to each census. Given the lack of modern medicine and public health
measures for the American Indian population, the increase is too rapid to be accepted
uncritically. Second, the estimates derived from the 1900 and 1910 samples do not agree with
each other in years in which they overlap. The age model, for example, suggests a life

6

There are other potential problems in using the duration approach. The use of marriage duration as a proxy for the
exposure to risk of childbearing assumes, first, that marriage is the appropriate situation in which almost all
childbearing occurs and, second, that remarriage is not common. The first assumption is reasonable for the white
population of United States in 1900 but may not be true for the American Indian population.

10

expectancy at birth of approximately 45 years centred about 1896 using the 1900 census data and
an estimate of 36 centred about 1897 using the 1910 census data. Third, the similar pattern of
rapidly increasing life expectancy using both the 1900 and 1910 samples suggests that a similar
bias was at work in each census. It is impossible to be specific about the causes of the bias, but
misstatement of mother’s age, misstatement of martial duration, misstatement of times married,
identification of mother’s sociological instead of biological children, children ever born and
children surviving recall errors, or even deliberate misstatement of children ever born and
children information are all possible sources of bias.
Given the problem of unknown remarriage in the 1900 duration model and the potential
problem of defining marriage and its duration in the American Indian population, it is probably
best to focus on results for the age model. But given the wide range of implied life expectancies
and the potential for age misstatement and other forms of bias, which estimates are best? The
value of q1, estimated from the child survivorship data reported by mother’s age 15-19, is clearly
too high to be believed. Implied life expectancy at birth estimated in with the 1900 sample is
almost 63 years, 20 years greater than that for the white population. In addition to the many
possible biases listed above, the estimate of q1 also suffers from a relatively short exposure of
children to the risk of dying and a corresponding small number of child deaths. At the other
extreme, the value of q20, estimated from the child survivorship data reported by mother’s age
45-49, may be biased by the increasing tendency of older Indian women to misreport their age
and children survival data.
The value of q5, estimated from data reported by women 30-34, is probably a good
compromise between avoiding the fewer cases of child mortality reported by younger women
and the potential of age misstatement and memory recall errors associated with elderly mothers.

11

The q5 estimate applies on average to about 1893- 1894 in the 1900 sample and about 1903-1904
in the 1910 sample. These results imply an expectation of life at birth for the American Indian
population overall of 39.1 years in the early 1890s and 38.4 years in early 1900s. In contrast, the
data implies an e0 of 50-51 years for the white population and of about 42 years for the black
population in 1893-94 and an e0 52-53 years for the white population and of about 43 years for
the black population in 1903-04. Thus the American Indian population was at a very serious
mortality disadvantage to the majority white population and even a slight disadvantage to the
black population.
Although valuable, the child mortality data reported in tables 2 and 3 apply to a limited
part of the life span. A life table, which summarizes the algebraic relationships between all age
groups and mortality, survivorship, and life expectancy, is more valuable. Life tables have
numerous applications in the study of mortality, fertility, migration, and population growth and
are especially useful tools for the study of populations covered by a census but lacking a vital
registration system, such as the American Indian population. When combined with indirect
methods, for example, life tables can be used to estimate vital rates or project populations from
census age distributions and estimate age-specific fertility rates from census microdata samples.
Table 4 is a life table for the male and female American Indian population circa 1894 and
table 5 is a life table for the American Indian population circa 1904. Both tables were
constructed by fitting the implied life expectancy at birth from the age model for Indian women
age 30-34 years to the Model West life table system. At a given level of mortality, the model
assumes that female mortality is lower than that for males. Thus, life expectancy is circa 1894 is
estimated to be 37.9 years at birth for Indian males and 40.6 years for Indian females. The
implied infant mortality rates are very high, about 203 infant deaths in the first 12 months per

12

thousand live births for Indian males and 174 per thousand for Indian females. The survivorship
column, lx, indicates that for less than half of all Indian males survive to be age 45 and half of all
Indian females to age 50.

Constructing Life Tables Using Two-Census Methods
Availability of the IPUMS samples of the American Indian population also allows the use
of two-census methods to evaluate adult survival of the American Indian population in the
intercensal period.7 Two-census methods have been a standard tool of demographers since the
nineteenth century. Although there are well-known pitfalls in using two censuses to estimate
mortality—including the problems created by differential enumeration, migration, age-reporting
errors, and lack of population stability—newer methods help minimize bias from these sources.
Preston and Bennett’s census-based method for estimating adult mortality does not depend on a
model life table system, the survival of kin, or assumptions of population stability (1983). The
method relates the number of individuals at any two ages through age-specific growth rates and
age-specific mortality rates and requires only age distributions in two census years and an
assumption of a closed population.
The extent to which the American Indian population was not a closed population is
probably the largest source of error. Despite some movements of individuals across the Canadian
and Mexican borders, international migration appears to have been negligible relative to the total
size of the population. The larger problem appears to be individuals who moved across racial
categories in the two censuses. Although we cannot be sure of the size and direction of this

Two-census methods often rely on published age distribution methods. Because the 1900 results were never
published, the 1900 IPUMS sample is needed to provide the necessary age distribution.

“migration,” there is good reason to believe that it ran it both directions. During the four decades
surrounding the turn of the twentieth century, the federal government’s “campaign to assimilate
American Indians” forced American Indians to learn English, shift from traditional subsistence
strategies to farming, wear “citizen’s clothing,” and become U.S. citizens (Hoxie, 1984).
Continuing intermarriage of the American Indian population with whites and blacks furthered the
trend towards assimilation and produced children of mixed ancestry (see Figure 1). These
pressures no doubt caused some individuals of full or partial Indian ancestry who were
enumerated as Indians in the 1900 census to be enumerated as non-Indians in the 1910. If there
were substantial numbers of such individuals, estimates of mortality based on two-census
methods would be biased upwards. The revised 1910 census instructions strongly encouraging
enumerators to record the race of individuals having full or partial American Indian ancestry as
Indians, however, probably resulted in racial migration in the opposite direction (citations) and
biased estimates of mortality downwards.
Table 6 presents the application of the Preston-Bennett census-based procedure to the
combined age distribution of American Indians in the general 1900 IPUMS and 1900 Indian
IPUMS samples and the age distribution of the American Indian population published by the
U.S. Census Bureau for the 1910 census (1915).8 Life expectancy estimates for both sexes are
provided for ages 10 and over. At age 10, American Indian males could expect to live an
additional 37.3 years. The corresponding figure for American Indian females is 34.9 years.
Higher male life expectancy, which reaches a peak differential of almost 4 years at age 30, is
unusual. The vast majority of modern populations have a sex mortality differential in favour of
females at all ages. It is nonetheless possible that American Indian females in the early twentieth

The 1900 census samples were weighted to reflect a national population of 237,196 American Indians. Each
individual in the general 1900 IPUMS sample indentified as an Indian received a weight of 102.224 while those in
the American Indian oversample received a weight of 5.111.

century suffered higher mortality than American Indian males. The American Indian population
suffered from endemic tuberculosis, which historically took a higher toll among females,
especially women in their childbearing years. High fertility in the American Indian population
was also associated with high maternal mortality rates. Alternatively, sex differentials in the age
reporting errors, race reporting errors, and census coverage may have led to the unusual results.
<Place Table 6 about here>
The Preston-Bennett results indicate much lower life expectancies at younger ages than
implied by the child surviving method (the difference at age 10 is -7.5 years for males and -11.9
for females). If the Preston Bennett results are fitted to model West, the age 10 estimates suggest
an e0 in the low 20s. At higher ages, however, estimated life expectancy improves rapidly
relative to the model. At age 25, the corresponding Model West life expectancy for American
Indian males is 35 years, at age 45 it is 48 years, and at age 65 almost 70 years. The internal
inconsistencies in the age pattern of mortality strongly suggest census coverage errors, age
reporting errors (especially at older ages), the lack of a closed population, or some combination
of these factors. Preston and Bennett hypothesize a scenario in which the second census is less
complete, with coverage errors constant by age (Preston and Bennett 1983: 94-98). Under such a
scenario, the set of intercensal growth rates are too low and the estimated life expectancy will be
too low, with proportionally greater bias at lower ages. Such a scenario is consistent with the
results, but not with the emphasis by the Census Bureau in 1910 to count all individuals of partial
Indian ancestry as Indians. It is also possible that errors in coverage—whether from migration,
race reporting errors, or under-enumeration—will be concentrated at younger ages. Mixed race
American Indians, for example, may be more likely to be reported as Indians when living as a

15

child in the household of an Indian parent than when living in their own household.9 Under a
scenario in which a mixed-race individual is more assimilated than their American Indian
parent—perhaps speaking English, practicing a non-traditionally Indian occupation, and having a
non-Indian spouse—race reporting errors were probably common.

Conclusions
This paper has been an attempt to practice demography with the 1900 and 1910 American Indian
censuses: the first surviving censuses that attempted at a comprehensive enumeration of all
American Indians living in the United States. Several life tables were constructed, which should
prove useful in future analyses. Confidence in the accuracy of the results, however, is low. Age
reporting errors are clearly present in the data and internal inconsistencies in the results suggest
the presence of various types of bias.
Difficulties census enumerators faced in assigning “race” is especially problematic,
especially in estimation of mortality with two-census methods, which assumes that the American
Indian population was closed to migration. The early twentieth century was a period of great
change for the American Indian population, with coercive federal assimilation policies
encouraging the division of collective tribal lands, its allotment to individuals and families, the
education of Indian children in specialized boarding schools, and the granting of citizenship to
the majority of Indians living in the nation’s borders. American Indians were increasingly
intermarrying with the nation’s white population and census evidence suggests that individuals
identified as Indians were increasingly of mixed-race decent. Given these challenges,
consistently assigning individuals to the same race in each census would be a major challenge.

See M. Giovanna Merli’s application of the Preston-Bennett method to two successive censuses in Vietnam for
analysis of similar types of age-specific errors and their analysis (Merli 1998).

16

Internal age inconsistencies in the mortality estimates reported above strongly suggests that
substantial numbers of individuals indentified as an American Indian in one census “migrated”
across racial categories in earlier or subsequent censuses.
Despite these difficulties, the demographic evidence indicates that the American Indian
population suffered from substantial mortality in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries. Life expectancy at birth was probably about 40 years, substantially lower than the
white population and even lower than the black population. With proper care, the American
Indian censuses can be used for a great variety of demographic analyses. They thus represent a
valuable contribution of the study of American Indian demography.
