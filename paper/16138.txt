Has ICT Polarized Skill Demand? Evidence from Eleven Countries over 25 years

NBER Working Paper No. 16138
June 2010
JEL No. J23,J24,O33
ABSTRACT
OECD labor markets have become more "polarized" with employment in the middle of the skill distribution
falling relative to the top and (in recent years) also the bottom of the skill distribution. We test the
hypothesis of Autor, Levy, and Murnane (2003) that this is partly due to information and communication
technologies (ICT) complementing the analytical tasks primarily performed by highly educated workers
and substituting for routine tasks generally performed by middle educated workers (with little effect
on low educated workers performing manual non-routine tasks). Using industry level data on the US,
Japan, and nine European countries 1980-2004 we find evidence consistent with ICT-based polarization.
Industries with faster growth of ICT had greater increases in relative demand for high educated workers
and bigger falls in relative demand for middle educated workers. Trade openness is also associated
with polarization, but this is not robust to controls for technology (like R&D). Technologies can account
for up to a quarter of the growth in demand for the college educated in the quarter century since 1980.

1. Introduction
The demand for more highly educated workers appears to have risen for many
decades across OECD countries. Despite a large increase in the supply of such
workers, the return to college education has not fallen. Instead, it has risen
significantly since the early 1980s in the US, UK, and many other nations (see
Machin and Van Reenen, 2008). The consensus view is that this increase in skill
demand is linked to technological progress (e.g. Goldin and Katz, 2008) rather
than increased trade with low wage countries (although see Krugman, 2008, for a
more revisionist view).
Recent analyses of data through the 2000s, however, suggest a more nuanced
view of the change in demand for skills. Autor, Katz, and Kearney (2007, 2008)
use US data to show that although “upper tail” inequality (between the 90th and
50th percentiles of the wage distribution) has continued to rise in an almost secular
way over the last thirty years, “lower tail” inequality (between the 50th and 10th
percentiles of the distribution) increased during the 1980s but has stayed relatively
flat from around 1990. They also show a related pattern for diﬀerent education
groups, with the hourly wages of college graduates’ rising relative to high school
graduates since 1980, and high school graduates gaining relative to high school
dropouts during the 1980s but not since then. When considering occupations,
rather than education groups, Goos and Manning (2007) describe a polarization
of the workforce. In the UK middle skilled occupations have declined relative to
both the highly skilled and low skilled occupations. Spietz-Oener (2006) finds
related results for Germany and Goos, Manning and Salomons (2009) find similar
results for several OECD countries1 .
What could account for these trends? One explanation is that new technolo1

gies, such as information and communication technologies (ICT), are complementary with human capital and rapid falls in quality-adjusted ICT prices have therefore increased skill demand. There is a large body of literature broadly consistent
with this notion2 . A more sophisticated view has been oﬀered by Autor, Levy
and Murnane (2003) who emphasize that ICT substitutes for routine tasks but
complements non-routine analytical tasks. Many routine tasks were traditionally
performed by less educated workers, such as assembly workers in a car factory, and
many of the analytical non-routine tasks are performed by more educated workers
such as consultants, advertising executives and physicians. However, many routine tasks are also performed in occupations employing middle educated workers,
such as bank clerks, and these groups may find demand for their services falling as
a result of computerization. Similarly many less educated workers are employed in
non-routine manual tasks such as janitors or cab drivers, and these tasks are much
less aﬀected by ICT. Since the numbers of routine jobs in the traditional manufacturing sectors (like car assembly) declined substantially in the 1970s, subsequent
ICT growth may have primarily increased demand for highly educated workers
at the expense of those in the middle of the educational distribution and left the
least educated (mainly working in non-routine manual jobs) largely unaﬀected.
Although this theory is attractive there is currently little direct international
evidence that ICT causes a substitution from middle-skilled workers to high-skilled
workers. Autor, Levy and Murnane (2003) show some consistent trends for the
US and Autor and Dorn (2009) exploit spatial variation across the US to show
that the growth in low skilled services has been faster in areas where initially there
were high proportions of routine jobs.3

See Bond and Van Reenen (2007) for a survey. Industry level data are used by Berman,
Bound and Griliches (1994), Autor, Katz and Krueger (1998) and Machin and Van Reenen
(1998). Krueger (1993), DiNardo and Pischke (1997) and Lang (2002) use individual data.

The closest antecedent of our paper is perhaps Autor, Katz and Krueger (1998, Table V)
who found that in the US the industry level growth of demand for US high school graduates

In this paper we test the hypothesis that ICT may be behind the polarization
of the labor market by implementing a simple test using 25 years of international
cross-industry data. If the ICT-based explanation for polarization is correct, then
we would expect that industries and countries that had a faster growth in ICT
also experienced an increase in demand for college educated workers, relative to
workers with intermediate levels of education. In this paper we show that this is
indeed a robust feature of the international data.
We exploit the new EUKLEMS database, which provides data on college graduates and disaggregates non-college workers into two groups: those with low education and those with “middle level” education. For example, in the US the
middle education group includes those with some college and high school graduates, but excludes high school drop-outs and GEDs (see Timmer et al, 2007, Table
5.3 for the country specific breakdown). The EUKLEMS database covers eleven
developed economies (US, Japan, and nine countries in Western Europe) from
1980-2004 and also contains data on ICT capital. In analyzing the data we consider not only the potential role of ICT, but also several alternative explanations.
In particular, we examine whether the role of trade in changing skill demand could
have become more important in recent years (most of the early studies pre-dated
the growth of China and India as major players).
The idea behind our empirical strategy is that the rapid fall in quality-adjusted
ICT prices will have a greater eﬀect in some country-industry pairs that are more
reliant on ICT. This is because some industries are for technological reasons inherently more reliant on ICT than others. We have no compelling natural experiment,
however, so our results should be seen as conditional correlations. We do, howbetween 1993 and 1979 was negatively correlated with the growth of computer use between 1993
and 1984. We find this is a robust feature of 11 OECD countries over a much longer time period.

ever, implement some instrumental variable strategies using the industry-specific
base year levels of US ICT intensity and/or routine tasks as an instrument for
subsequent ICT increases in other countries. These support the OLS results.
We conclude that technology - both ICT and Research and Development
(R&D) - has raised relative demand for college educated workers and, consistent
with the ICT-based polarization hypothesis, this increase has come mainly from
reducing the relative demand for middle skilled workers rather than low skilled
workers.
The paper is laid out as follows. Section II describes the empirical model,
Section III the data and Section IV the empirical results. Section V oﬀers some
concluding comments.

2. Empirical Model
Consider the short-run variable cost function, CV (.):
CV (W H , W M , W L ; C, K, Q)

(2.1)

where W indicates hourly wages and superscripts denote education/skill group
S (H = highly educated workers, M = middle educated workers and L = low
educated workers), K = non-ICT capital services, C = ICT capital services and
Q = value added. If we assume that the capital stocks are quasi-fixed, factor prices
are exogenous and that the cost function can be approximated by a second order
flexible functional form such as translog then cost minimization (using Shephard’s
Lemma) implies the following three skill share equations:

SHARE H = φHH ln(W H /W L )+φMH ln(W M /W L )+αCH ln(C/Q)+αKH ln(K/Q)+αQH ln Q
(2.2)

5

SHARE M = φHM ln(W H /W L )+φMM ln(W M /W L )+αCM ln(C/Q)+αKM ln(K/Q)+αQM ln Q
(2.3)

SHARE L = φHL ln(W H /W L )+φML ln(W M /W L )+αCL ln(C/Q)+αCL ln(K/Q)+αCM ln Q,
(2.4)
W SNS

where SHARE S = W H N H +W S N M +W L N L is the wage bill share of skill group S =
{H, M, L} and N S is the number of hours worked by skill group S. Our hypothesis
of the ICT-based polarization theory is that αH > 0 and αM < 0 4 .

Our empirical specifications are based on these equations. We assume that
labor markets are national in scope and include country by time eﬀects to capture relative wages (φjt ). We also assume that there is unobserved heterogeneity
between industry by country pairs (η ij ) and include fixed eﬀects to account for
these, giving the following three equations:

SHARE S = φjt + η ij + αCS ln(C/Q)ijt + αKS ln(K/Q)ijt + αQS ln Qijt ,

(2.5)

where i = industry, j =country and t = year. We estimate in long (25 year)
diﬀerences, ∆,to look at the historical trends and smooth out measurement error.
We substitute levels rather than logarithms (i.e. ∆(C/Q) instead of ∆ ln(C/Q))
because of the very large changes in ICT intensity over this time period. Some
industry by country pairs had close to zero IT intensity in 1980 so their change
is astronomical in logarithmic terms5 . Consequently our three key estimating
equations are:
4

The exact correspondence between the coeﬃcients on the capital inputs and the Hicks-Allen
elasticity of complementarity is more complex (see Brown and Christensen, 1981).
5
The range of ∆ ln(C/Q) lies between -1 and 23.5. We report some robustness checks using
∆(C/Q)
as an approximation.

(2.6)

In the robustness tests we also consider augmenting equation (2.6) in various
ways. Since ICT is only one aspect of technical change we also consider using Research and Development expenditures. Additionally, we consider trade variables
(such as imports plus exports over value added) to test whether industries that
were exposed to more trade upgraded the skills of their workforce at a more rapid
rate than those who did not. This is a pragmatic empirical approach to examining
trade eﬀects. Under a strict Heckscher-Ohlin approach trade is a general equilibrium eﬀect increasing wage inequality throughout the economy so looking at the
variation by industry would be uninformative. However, since trade costs have
declined more rapidly in some sectors than others (e.g. due to trade liberalization)
we would expect the actual flows of trade to proxy this change and there to be
a larger eﬀect on workers in these sectors than in others who were less aﬀected
(Krugman, 2008, makes this argument).
Appendix A considers a theoretical model with parameter restrictions over
equation (2.1) that implies that ICT is a substitute for middle skilled labor and a
complement with highly skilled labor. Comparative static results from the model
suggest that as ICT increases (caused by a fall in the quality-adjusted price of
ICT) the wage bill share of skilled workers rises and the share of middle skilled
workers falls. It also shows that all else equal an exogenous increase in the supply
of middle skilled workers will cause their wage bill share to rise. Thus, although
ICT could reduce the demand for the middle skilled group their share could still
rise because of the long-run increase in supply.

3. Data
3.1. Data Construction
The main source of data for this paper is the EUKLEMS dataset, which contains data on value added, labor, capital, skills and ICT for various industries in
many developed countries (see Timmer et al, 2007). The EUKLEMS data are
constructed using data from each country’s National Statistical Oﬃce (e.g. the
US Census Bureau) and harmonized with each country’s national accounts. EUKLEMS contains some data on most OECD countries. But since we require data
on skill composition, investment and value added between 1980 and 2004, our
sample of countries is restricted to eleven: Austria, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK and the USA6 .
Another choice we had to make regards the set of industries we analyze. Since
our baseline year (1980) was close to the peak of the oil boom, we have dropped
energy-related sectors - mining and quarrying, coke manufactures and the supply of natural gas - from the sample (we report results that are very robust to
the inclusion of these sectors). The remaining sample includes 27 industries in
each country (see Appendix Table A1). But wage data by skill category are only
reported separately by industry in some countries. We therefore aggregate industries to the lowest possible level of aggregation for which all the variables we
use could be constructed — the precise level of disaggregation varied by country
(see Appendix Table A2)7 . Our final sample has 208 observations on countryindustry cells for each of the years between 1980 and 2004. We also have data for
6

In order to increase the number of countries we would need to considerably shorten the
period we analyze. For example, limiting our analysis to 1992-2004 (12 years instead of 25) only
adds Belgium. To further add Czech Republic, Slovenia and Sweden we would need to restrict
the sample to 1995-2004. In order to preserve the longer time series we focused on the 11 core
OECD countries.

Results are robust to throwing away information and harmonizing all countries at the same
level of industry aggregation.

intervening years, which we use in some of the robustness checks.
For each country-industry-year cell in our dataset we construct a number of
variables. Our main outcome is the wage bill share of workers of diﬀerent educational groups, which is a standard indicator for skill demand. In 9 of the 11
countries, the high skilled group indicates whether an employee has attained a
college degree8 . A novel feature of our analysis is that we also consider the wage
bill of middle skill workers. The precise composition of this group varies across
countries, since educational systems diﬀer considerably. But typically, this group
consists of high school graduates, people with some college education, and people
with non-academic professional degrees.
Our main measure for use of new technology is Information and Communication Technology (ICT) capital divided by value added. Similarly, we also use
the measure of non-ICT capital divided by value added. EUKLEMS builds these
variables using the perpetual inventory method from the underlying investment
flow data for several types of capital (see Data Appendix). For the tradable industries (Agriculture and Manufacturing) we construct measures of trade flows
using UN COMTRADE data (21st March 2008 updates)9 . Details are contained
in the Data Appendix.
3.2. Descriptive statistics
3.2.1. Cross Country Trends
Panel A of Table 1 shows summary statistics for the levels of the key variables in
1980 across each country and Panel B presents the same for the changes through

In two countries the classification of high skilled workers is diﬀerent: in Denmark it includes
people in “long cycle” higher education and in Finland it includes people with tertiary education
or higher.

Using a crosswalk (available from the authors upon request) we calculate the value of total
trade, imports and exports with the rest of the world and separately with OECD and non-OECD
countries. We identify all 30 countries that were OECD members in 2007 as part of the OECD.

2004. The levels have to be interpreted with care as exact comparison of qualifications between countries is diﬃcult, which is why wage bill shares are useful
summary measures as each qualification is weighted by its price (the wage)10 .
The ranking of countries looks sensible with the US having the highest share of
high-skilled (29 percent), followed by Finland (27 percent). All countries have experienced significant skill upgrading as indicated by the growth in the high skilled
wage bill share in column (1) of Panel B, on average the share increased form 14.3
percent in 1980 to 24.3 in 2004.
The UK had the fastest absolute increase in the high-skilled wage bill share
(16.5 percentage points) and is also the country with the largest increase in ICT
intensity. The US had the second largest growth of ICT and the third largest
increase in the high-skilled wage bill share (13.9 percentage points), but all countries have experienced rapid increases in ICT intensity, which doubled its 1980
share of value added.
The change of the middle education share in column (2) is more uneven. Although the mean growth is positive, it is relatively small compared to the highly
educated (8.7 percentage points on a base of 51.1 percent), with several countries
experiencing no growth or a decrease (the US and the Netherlands). The model
in Appendix A shows how the wage bill share of the middle skilled could rise as
the supply of this type of skill increases, so this supply increase can oﬀset the fall
in relative demand caused by technical change. Moreover, as Figure 2A shows,
although the wage bill share of the middle group rose more rapidly (in percentage
point terms) between 1980 and 1986, it subsequently decelerated. Indeed, in the
last six year sub-period, 1998-2004, the wage bill share of middle skilled workers
actually fell. At the same time, the wage bill share of low skilled workers continued

10

to decline throughout the period 1980-2004, but at an increasingly slower rate.
Figure 2B shows the US, the technology leader that is often a future indicator
for other nations. From 1998-2004 the wage bill share of the middle educated
declined more rapidly than that of the low skilled workers. Figure 2B is in line
with the finding that while college educated US workers continued to gain relative to high-school graduates, high-school graduates gained relatively to college
dropouts in the 1980s but not in the 1990s (see Autor, Katz and Kearney, 2008,
Figure 5).
3.2.2. Cross Industry Trends
Table 2 breaks down the data by industry. In levels (column (1)) the highly educated were disproportionately clustered into services both in the public sector
(especially education) and private sector (e.g. real estate and business services).
The industries that upgraded rapidly (column (8)) were also mainly services (e.g.
finance, telecoms and business services), but also in manufacturing (e.g. chemicals and electrical equipment). At the other end of the skill distribution, the
textile industry, which initially had the lowest wage bill share of skilled workers,
upgraded somewhat more than other low skill industries (transport and storage,
construction, hotels and restaurants, and agriculture). This raises the issue of
mean reversion, so we are careful to later show robustness tests to conditioning
on the initial levels of the skill shares in our regressions. In fact, the ranking of
industries in terms of skill intensity in 1980 and their skill upgrading over the next
25 years was quite similar across countries. This is striking, because the countries
we analyze had diﬀerent labor market institutions and diﬀerent institutional experiences over the period we analyze. This suggests something fundamental is at
play that cuts across diﬀerent sets of institutions.
ICT grew dramatically from 1980-2004, accounting for more than 42 percent

11

of the average increase in capital services. The increased ICT diﬀusion was also
quite uneven: financial intermediation and telecoms experienced rapid increases
in ICT intensity, while in other industries, such as agriculture, there was almost
no increase.
Figures 3, 4, and 5 plot changes by industry in the wage bill shares of high,
medium, and low skilled workers respectively against changes in ICT intensity.
The top panel of each figure includes all industries with fitted regression lines
(solid line for all industry and dashed line for non-traded sectors only). The
bottom panel (Figure 3B) restricts attention to the traded sectors. Figure 3A
shows that the industries with the fastest ICT upgrading had the largest increase
in the high skilled wage bill share. One might be worried that two service sectors,
Post and Telecoms and Finance, are driving this result, which is one reason Figure
3B drops all the non-traded sectors. In fact, the relationship between high skill
and ICT growth is actually stronger in these “well measured” sectors.
Figure 4 repeats this analysis for the middle educated groups. We observe
the exact opposite relationship to Figure 3: the industries with the faster ICT
growth had the largest fall in the middle skilled share whether we look at the
whole economy (Figure 4A) or just the traded sectors (Figure 4B). Finally, Figure
5 shows that there is essentially no relationship (Figure 5A) or a mildly positive
one (Figure 5B) between the change of the share of the least educated and ICT
growth.
These figures are highly suggestive of empirical support for the hypothesis that
ICT polarizes the skill structure: increasing demand at the top, reducing demand
in the middle and having little eﬀect at the bottom. To examine this link more
rigorously, we now turn to the econometric analysis.

12

4. Econometric Results
4.1. Basic Results
Our first set of results for the skill share regressions at the industry by country pair
level is contained in Table 3. The dependent variable is the change of the wage bill
share of the college-educated in Panel A, the share of the middle educated group
in Panel B and the share of the least educated group in Panel C. All equations are
estimated in 24 year long diﬀerences. The first four columns look across the entire
economy and the last four columns condition on the sub-sample of “tradable”
sectors where we have information on imports and exports.
Column (1) of Panel A simply reports the coeﬃcient on the constant that indicates that, on average there was a ten percentage point increase in the college
wage bill share. This is a very large increase, considering the average skill share
in 1980 (across our sample of countries) was only 14%. Column (2) includes the
growth in ICT capital intensity. The technology variable has a large, positive and
significant coeﬃcient and reduces the regression constant to 8.7. The importance
of technology for skill upgrading is consistent with other work, which has found
technology-skill complementarity. Column (3) includes the growth of non-ICT
capital intensity and value added. The coeﬃcient on non-ICT capital is negative
and insignificant, suggesting that there is no sign of capital-skill complementarity. Some studies have found capital-skill complementarity (e.g. Griliches, 1969)
but few of these studies have disaggregated capital into its ICT and non-ICT
components, so the evidence for capital-skill complementarity may be due to aggregating over high-tech capital that is complementary with skills and lower tech
capital that is not. Similarly few studies have looked over such a long time span as
we do in this paper. The coeﬃcient on value added growth is positive and significant suggesting that skill upgrading has been occurring more rapidly in the fastest

13

growing sectors (this is consistent with Berman, Rohini and Tan, 2005). Column
(4) includes country fixed eﬀects. This is a demanding specification because the
specification is already in diﬀerences so this specification essentially allows for
country specific trends. The coeﬃcient on ICT falls (from 65 to 47) but remains
significant at conventional levels11 .
We repeat these specifications for the tradeable industries in the next four
columns. Column (5) shows that the overall increase in the college wage-bill share
from 1980-2004 was 9 percentage points - similar to that in the whole sample.
Columns (6) - (8) add in our measure of ICT and other controls. The coeﬃcient
on ICT in the tradeable sector is positive, highly significant and larger than in
the overall sample (e.g. 129 in column (8)).
Panel B of Table 3 repeats these specifications for middle-skilled workers. Column (1) shows that overall, the growth of the wage bill share of middle skilled
workers has been 8.7 percentage points over this time period. But as the rest
of the panel shows, the association between the change in middle-skilled workers
and ICT is strongly negative. In column (4), for example, a one percentage point
increase in ICT intensity is associated with a 0.8 percentage point fall in the proportion of middle skilled workers. The absolute magnitudes of the coeﬃcients for
the sample that includes all industries is quite similar to those for college educated
workers.
Panel C holds the low-skilled worker results - the coeﬃcients can all be deduced
from the rest of Table 3, but the standard errors are useful to see. Importantly,
the technology measures appear to be insignificant for this group of workers illustrating the point that the main role of ICT appears to be in changing demand
11

Including the mineral extraction sectors caused the ICT coeﬃcient to fall from 47 to 45.
We also tried including a set of industry dummies in column (4). All the variables became
insignificant in this specification. This suggests that it is the same industries that are upgrading
across countries.

14

between the top and the middle skill groups12 . Since the adding up requirement
means that the coeﬃcients for the least skilled group can be deduced from the
other two skill groups we save space by omitting Panel C in the rest of the Tables.
4.2. Robustness and Extensions
4.2.1. Initial conditions
Table 4 examines some robustness checks using the results in our preferred specification of column (4) of Table 3 (reproduced in the first column). Since there may
be mean reversion we include the level of initial share of skills in 1980 in column
(2). This does not qualitatively alter the results, although coeﬃcient on ICT for
the middle skilled does fall somewhat.
4.2.2. Heterogeneity in the coeﬃcients across countries
Wage inequality rose less in Continental Europe than elsewhere, so it is interesting
to explore whether technological change induced polarization even there. Columns
(3) and (4) restrict the sample to the eight Continental European countries (i.e.
Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands and Spain) and
show qualitatively similar results to the pooled sample. Unfortunately, the sample
size for most individual countries is rather small preventing a full country by
country analysis13 . For example, column (5) shows that the correlation between
ICT and polarization is larger for the US than for the full sample, though column
(5) shows that the estimates become imprecise when we control for baseline levels
of skill composition.
12

The diﬀerence in the importance of ICT for the middle and lowest skill groups implies that
high school graduates are not perfect substitutes for college graduates as Card (2009) argues
in the US context. The majority of our data is from outside the US, however, where there are
relatively fewer high school graduates.
13
Due to the above-mentioned restriction that wage bill data is aggregated for some industries
in most countries.

15

4.2.3. Instrumental variables
One concern is that measurement error in the right hand side variables, especially
ICT, causes attenuation bias14 . To mitigate this concern, we use the industry-level
measures of ICT in the US in 1980 as an instrument for ICT upgrading over the
whole sample. The intuition behind this instrument is that the dramatic global
fall in quality-adjusted ICT prices since 1980 (some 15-30% per annum) will disproportionately benefit those industries that (for exogenous technological reasons)
have a greater potential for using ICT inputs. An indicator of this potential is the
initial ICT intensity in the technological leader, the US. In the 2SLS estimates of
column (7) the coeﬃcient on ICT is roughly twice as large as the OLS coeﬃcients
for the college educated group (and significant at the 5 percent level), and a little
bigger for the middle skill group. Column (8) report estimates the same specification but this time excluding the US itself, and the results are very similar. We also
considered using the proportion of routine manual tasks in the industry (in the US
in the base year) as an instrument for future ICT growth as these industries were
most likely to be aﬀected by falling ICT prices (see Autor and Dorn, 2009). The
results of using this instrument are shown in columns (9) and (10). Although the
first stages are weaker with this instrument15 , these columns again suggest that
we may be under-estimating the importance of ICT by just using OLS - there is
certainly no evidence of downward bias.
14

Estimates of the ICT coeﬃcient for the two 12-year sub-periods of our data are typically
about half of the absolute magnitude of those for the full period. In general, our estimates for
shorter time periods are smaller and less precise, consistent with the importance of measurement
error in the ICT data. For example, in the specification of column (4) of Panel A in Table 3, the
coeﬃcient (standard error) on ICT was 18.30 (10.30) in a pooled 12 year regression. We could
not reject the hypothesis that the ICT coeﬃcient was stable over time (p-value=0.35).
15
The signs of the instruments in the first stage are correct. The F-tests is 6.5 in column (7)
compared to 10.5 in column (10).

4.2.4. Disaggregating the wage bill into wages and hours
The wage bill share of each skill group reflects its hourly wage and hours worked,
and those of the other skill groups. We now discuss estimates of specifications
that are identical to those in Table 3, except that they allow for a disaggregation
of the dependent variable into the growth of relative skill prices and quantities.
In the first two columns of Appendix Table A3 we reproduce the baseline specifications using the log relative wage bill (which can be exactly decomposed) as the
dependent variable16 . Columns (1) - (4) confirm what we have already seem using
a slightly diﬀerent functional form: ICT growth is associated with a significant
increase in the demand for high skilled workers relative to middle skilled workers
(first two columns) and with a significant (but smaller) increase for low skilled
workers relative to middle skilled workers (third and fourth column).
For the high vs. middle skill group, ICT growth is significantly associated with
increases in relative wages and relative hours (columns (5), (6), (9) and (10)). In
comparing the middle vs. low groups, the coeﬃcients are also all correctly signed,
but not significant at conventional levels. Overall this suggests that our results
are robust to functional form and the shifting pattern of demand operates both
through wages and hours worked17 .
4.3. Trade, R&D and skill upgrading
Having found that technology upgrading is associated with substitution of collegeeducated workers for middle-skilled workers, we now examine whether changes in
16

Another functional form check was using the growth rate of ICT intensity. For the specification in column (3) of Panel A in Table 3 we replaced ∆(C/Q) with ∆(C/Q)
C/Q . The coeﬃcient
(standard error) on ICT growth was 2.586 (1.020). The marginal eﬀect of a one standard deviation increase (0.581) is 1.50 (=0.581*2.586), compared with 1.55 (=0.024*64.6) in Table 3.
17
In examining these results across countries there was some evidence that the adjustment in
wages was stronger in the US and the adjustment in hours was stronger in Continental Europe.
This is consistent with the idea of great wage flexibility in the US than in Europe.

17

trade exhibit similar patterns. The first two columns of Table 5 suggest that more
trade openness (measured as the ratio of imports plus exports to value added) is
associated with increases in the wage bill share of college educated workers, at
least once we control for country time trends in column (2). Adding our measures
of ICT, value added and non-ICT capital weakens this result in column (3), but
the trade measure remains significant. However, the last two columns of Table 5
suggests that when we control for initial R&D intensity the association between
trade and skill upgrading becomes much smaller and ceases to be statistically
significant. Column (4) repeats the specification of column (3) for the sub-sample
where we have R&D data and shows that the trade coeﬃcient is robust. Column
(5) includes R&D intensity in a simple specification and shows that the coeﬃcient
on trade halves (from 0.5 to 0.24) and is insignificant, whereas the coeﬃcient on
R&D is positive and significant at the 10 percent level. In column (6) we include
the ICT and non-ICT capital stocks and the coeﬃcient on trade is now 0.11 with
a standard error of 0.25. The final column drops the insignificant trade variable
and shows that ICT and R&D and individually (and jointly) significant.
These findings are consistent with most of the literature that finds that technology variables have more explanatory power than trade in these kinds of skill
demand equations18 . Of course, trade could be influencing skill demand through
aﬀecting the incentives to innovate and adopt new technologies, which is why trade
ceases to be important after we condition on technology (e.g. Draca, Bloom and
Van Reenen, 2009, argue in favor of this trade-induced technical change hypothesis)19 . Furthermore, there could be many general equilibrium eﬀects of trade that
18

These are simple industry-level correlations and not general equilibrium calculations, so we
may be missing out the role of trade through other routes.
19
We further test whether the association between trade and skill upgrading remains similar
when we examine diﬀerent components of trade separately. Appendix Table A4 suggests that
when we examine imports and exports separately, the picture is quite similar. Greater trade
is associated with an increase in the college wage bill share until we control for initial R&D

18

we have not accounted for (these are controlled for by the country time eﬀects).
4.4. Magnitudes
We perform some “back of the envelope” calculations in Table 6 to gauge the
magnitude of the eﬀect of technology on the demand for highly skilled workers.
Column (1) estimates that ICT accounts for 13.2 percent of the increase in the
college share in the whole sample without controls and column (2) reduces this to
8.5 percent with controls. Many authors (e.g. Jorgenson, Ho and Stiroh, 2008)
have argued that value added growth has been strongly aﬀected by ICT growth,
especially in the later period, so column (2) probably underestimates the eﬀect of
ICT. Column (3) reports equivalent calculations for the tradeable sectors. Here,
ICT accounts for 16.5 percent of the change and R&D a further 16.1 percent,
suggesting that observable technology measures by account for almost a third of
the increase in demand for highly skilled workers. If we include controls in column
(4) this falls to 23.1 percent. Finally, columns (5) and (6) reports results for the
IV specification for the whole sample, showing an ICT contribution of ICT of
between 22.1 percent and 27.7 percent20 .
We have no general equilibrium model, so these are only “back of the envelope” calculations to give an idea of magnitudes. Furthermore, measurement error
probably means that we are probably underestimating the importance of the variables. Nevertheless, it seems that our measures of technology are important in
intensity, in which case the coeﬃcient on trade falls and becomes insignificant. Results are
similar when we analyze separately imports to (or exports from) OECD countries. For nonOECD countries the results are again the same, except for exports to non-OECD countries,
which remains positively associated with changes in the college wage-bill share even after we
add all the controls, including R&D. However, it should be noted that the change in exports to
developing countries is on average very small.
20
The IV specifications for tradeables show an even larger magnitude. For example in a
specification with full controls, R&D and ICT combined account for over half of all the change
in the college wage bill share. The first stage for the IV is weak, however, with an F-statistic of
6, these cannot be relied on.

explaining a significant proportion of the increase in demand for college educated
workers at the expense of the middle skilled.

5. Conclusions
Recent investigations into the changing demand for skills in OECD countries have
found some evidence for “polarization” in the labour market in the sense that
workers in the middle of the wage and skills distribution appear to have fared
more poorly than those at the bottom and the top. One explanation that has
been advanced for this is that ICT has complemented non-routine analytic tasks
but substituted for routine tasks whilst not aﬀecting non-routine manual tasks
(like cleaning, gardening, childcare, etc.). This implies that many middle-skilled
groups like bank clerks and para-legals performing routine tasks have suﬀered a
fall in demand. To test this we have estimated industry-level skill share equations
distinguishing three education groups and related this to ICT (and R&D) investments in eleven countries over 25 years using newly available data. Our findings
are supportive of the ICT-based polarization hypothesis as industries that experienced the fastest growth in ICT also experienced the fastest growth in the demand
for the most educated workers and the fastest falls in demand for workers with
intermediate levels of education. The eﬀects are nontrivial: technical change (as
proxied by ICT and R&D) can account for up to a quarter of the growth of the
college wage bill share in the economy as a whole (and more in the tradeable
sectors).
Although our method is simple and transparent, there are many extensions
that need to be made. First, alternative instrumental variables for ICT would
help identify the causal impact of ICT. As with the existing literature, we do
not have strong instruments for ICT. Second, although we find no direct role
for trade variables, there may be other ways in which globalization influences the

20

labour market, for example by causing firms to “defensively innovate” (Acemoglu,
2003). Third, there are alternative explanations for the improved performance of
the least skilled group through for example, greater demand from richer skilled
workers for the services they provide as market production substitutes for household production (e.g. childcare, eating out in restaurants, domestic work, etc.)21 .
These explanations may complement the mechanism we address here. Finally, we
have not used richer occupational data that would focus on the skill content of
tasks due to the need to have international comparability across countries. The
work of Autor and Dorn (2009) is an important contribution here.

A. Theory Appendix: A simple model of the eﬀect of ICT
on demand for three skill groups.
We present a simple model that illustrates how we could derive the relationships
we observe in the data. The exogenous variable is an increase in ICT capital
generated by a large fall in ICT prices. The prediction is that we can observe an
increase in the share of the high skilled and a decline in the share of the middle

24

skilled. Note that an increase in the supply of the middle skilled will also generate
an increase in their wage bill share.
The model below considers an aggregate (sectoral) production function using
three labor inputs: low skilled (L), middle skilled (M), and high skilled (H)
workers and ICT capital (C). The model also assumes a constant elasticity of
1
substitution σ = 1−ρ
> 1 between the three types of (ICT-augmented) labor
inputs, so ρ ∈ (0, 1). We assume that output, Q, is produced using the following
production function:
i ρ1
h
Q = αL Lρ + (αM M + βC)ρ + (αH H μ + γC μ )ρ/μ ,

where αj denotes the eﬀectiveness of each type of labor, j ∈ {L, M, H}. β measures the eﬀectiveness of ICT in substituting middle skilled labor and γ measures
ICT eﬀectiveness in complementing high skilled labor. The model assumes that
ICT capital (C) is a substitute for middle skilled workers, and a complement to
1
high skilled labor, where η = 1−μ
∈ (0, 1), so μ < 0. Note that the model only
treats the relationship between C and H in exactly the opposite way from the
relationship between C and M if η −→ 0 (or equivalently μ −→ −∞).
Assuming perfect competition, the wage of the three types of labor and the
cost of ICT are:

so increased supply of ICT raises the college wage bill share and reduces the middle

B. Data Appendix
Our main dataset is EUKLEMS (http://www.euklems.net/), which is an industrylevel panel dataset created by economic researchers funded by the European Commission. It covers the European Union, the US, Japan, and other countries, and
contains a wealth of information on productivity-related variables. These were
constructed through joint work with census bureaus in each country and are
designed to be internationally comparable. Details of the methodology are in
Timmer et al (2007).
In the construction of our sample we faced a number of technical issues. First,
although college wage bill shares are reported for 30 industries in each country,
these reported wage bill shares are not unique within each country. For example, in
a certain country the reported college wage bill share for industry A and industry
B may be (college wage bill in A + college wage bill in B)/(total wage bill in A +
total wage bill in B). The identity and number of industries pooled together vary
across countries. In order to use as much of variation as possible, we aggregate
industries within each country up to the lowest level of aggregation that ensures
that the college wage bill share is unique across the aggregated observations. This
is also suﬃcient to ensure that other variables we use, such as our ICT and value
added measures, have unique values across observations.
Second, as a measure of ICT intensity we use ICT capital compensation divided
by value added directly from EUKLEMs. ICT capital is built using the Perpetual
Inventory method based on real ICT investment flows (using a quality-adjusted
price deflator). ICT capital compensation is the stock of ICT capital multiplied
by its user cost. Non-ICT capital compensation is built in the same way22 .
Third, matching trade variables into our main dataset required data required
currency conversions, since EUKLEMS reports data in historical local currency
and COMTRADE reports data in historical dollars. To overcome this diﬀerence,
we convert nominal values to current US Dollars using exchange rates from the
IMF IFS website. To convert national currency to the Euro (for Eurozone countries), we use exchange rates from the website:
http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/transition/conversion_rates.htm
22

Because EUKLEMS calculates capital compensation as a residual in a few cases observations
can have negative capital compensation. Of the 208 country-industry cells we use, negative
capital compensation occurs in 12 cases in 1980 and in 3 cases in 2004. These are typically
agriculture (which is heavily subsidized and becomes smaller over time) and industries where
public services play an important role (e.g. education and health). To overcome this problem,
we bottom-coded negative values of ICT and non-ICT capital compensation to zero. Our results
are robust to dropping these observations from the sample.

27

We use trade figures from the UN’s COMTRADE dataset. Data is downloaded
in the four digit Standard International Trade Classification format (revision 2),
and converted to the European NACE Rev 1 classification used in the EUKLEMS
dataset (concordance available on request). Our trade regressions contain the
updated data from 21st March 2008.
To decompose trade into OECD versus non-OECD, we use the 2007 definition of OECD countries (Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland,
Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey,
the UK and the USA). This means that Czechoslovakia and Belgium-Luxembourg
were treated as OECD countries in 1980.
Finally, we account for the fact that the (aggregated) industries we use diﬀer
substantially in their employment shares within each country’s population. We
therefore use the employment shares of each industry in 1980 (our base year)
in total employment as analytical weights in the regressions using both tradable
and non-tradable industries. For trade regressions, which use only the traded
industries, each industry’s weight is its employment share in the traded industries
for that country, so that the sum of weights for each country is still equal to one.

Notes: Coefficients estimated by OLS with robust standard errors in parentheses. Regressions weighted by the industry's 1980 share
of each country's employment. In columns (7) and (8) we instrument the 25-year difference in ICT Capital/Value Added by the 1980
levels of ICT capital/Value Added in the USA. In columns (9) and (10) we instrument the 25-year difference in ICT Capital/Value
Added by the 1980 levels of routine task input using the 1991 Directory of Occupational Titles (constructed as in Autor, Levy and
Murnane (2003)).

Notes: Dependent variable in columns (1)-(4) is the 1980-2004 change in the Ln(relative wage bill), e.g. in column (1) this is
ln(wage bill of highly skilled workers) - ln(wage bill of medium skilled workers). The dependent variable in columns (5)-(8) is the
change in Ln(relative hourly wage), e.g. in column (5) it is the ln(hourly wage of highly skilled) - ln(hourly wage of medium
skilled). In columns (9)-(12) the dependent variable is the change in Ln(relative hours worked), e.g. in column (9) this is
ln(annual hours of highly skilled) - ln(annual hours of medium skilled) . Coefficients estimated by OLS with robust standard
