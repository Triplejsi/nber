A Tax—Based Test for Nominal Rigidities

ABSTRACT

In classical macroeconomic models with flexible wages and prices,
whether a tax is levied on producers or consumers does not affect its

incidence. However, if wages or prices are rigid in the short run, as they
are in Keynesian macroeconomic models, then shifting a tax from one side of

the market to the other may have real effects. Tax changes therefore provide
potential tests for the presence of nominal rigidities. This paper examines
the price and output effects of revenue-neutral shifts between direct and

indirect taxation. The results, based on post—war data from both Great
Britain and the United States, reject the view that wages and prices are
completely flexible in the short run.

The side of a market on which a tax is levied is irrelevant in

the

standard microeconomic analynis of taxation. Students in elementary
economics learn that it makes no difference whether a sales tax is collected

from buyers or sellers. They are taught that the ultimate incidence of a
payroll tax depends on the elasticities of supply and demand for labor, not

on whether the tax is levied on employees or employers. Broader equivalence
results concerning sales and income taxes are at the heart of the analysis of

general equilibrium tax incidence. Standard Keynesian macroeconomic analyses
take a very different view. Raising sales taxes is thought to be
inflationary, even if

microeconomic and Keynesian views diverge because the former

presumes that all wages and prices are fully flexible, while the latter
postulates rigid nominal wages. With wage rates fixed in the short run,

sales tax increases necessarily raise prices; raising income taxes has no
sucb effect. If nominal wages are rigid over reasonable lengths of time,
then the conventional tax analysis

must

be altered. Holding monetary

policy

constant, increases in the price level translate point for point into

reductions in output. Even a temporary one percent decline in NP could
dwarf the potential efficiency gains from many proposed tax reforms.
The

very existence of nominal rigidities is a subject of contemporary

macroeconomic debate. Many Keynesian scholars take it as self—evident that

nominal wages are sticky, at least in the short run. For example, Solow
(1980) invites his readers to "accept the apparent evidence of one's senses

and take[s] it for granted that the wage does not move flexibly to clear the
labor market." Other researchers claim that there is no available evidence
in support of this hypothesis. For example, King end Plosser (1984) write

2

that "Keynesian models typically rely on implausible wage or price
rigidities, from the textbook reliance on exogenous values to the recent more
sophisticated effort of Fischer that relies on nominal contracts."

changes in the money stock affect macroeconomic activity,

conclusively. Shifts between direct and indirect taxation can provide tests

Shifts From Direct to Indirect Taxation: Classical and Keynesian Views

I.

In textbook public finance models, the legal incidence of a sales tax

is of no consequence.1 It does not matter whether the tax is collected from
producers

or consumers. The important variables are the net

producers

receive and the gross price which consumers pay. Suppose producers

of a good receive P dollars per unit sold and consumers pay
per unit

they

price which

P(i+e) dollars

buy. Whether producers receive P(i+o) dollars and hand over

dollars to the government or the P® dollars are collected from the consumers

directly has no effect. If the government ceases to collect the tax from
consumers and starts levying it on firms, firms simply raise their price by

P0. The total amount consumers pay per unit and the net amount received

firms

by

remains constant.

The absence of short run wage and price flexibility is the essence of

Keynesian models. If the price producers charge consumers is temporarily
fixed, then the legal incidence of a sales tax does matter. A switch from
collecting P0 dollars from consumers to collecting them from producers
reduces the price paid by consumers to P, while the price received by firms

falls to p(i—e). This change affects real decisions.
This example of a sales tax in one market is only illustrative. More
generally, switches between income taxes and value added or sales taxes,
which essentially change the side of the market on which the tax is levied,

have real consequences when there are rigidities of the standard Keynesian

sort. The equivalence theorems of Break (1974) and NcLure (1975) establish
that in an economy without savings and with flexible prices, a sales tax on

results obtain. The second half of the section introduces wage and price
stickiness and demonstrates the failure of these familiar incidence results.

I. A. The Classical Framework
The equivalence between sales and income taxation is easily

demonstrated in a simple classical macroeconomic model with perfectly

flexible wages and prices. In the short run, aggregate output (Y) is a
function only of labor input (L):

Y= f(L).

(i)

With competitive firms, a notional aggregate labor demand schedule can be
obtained by equating the marginal product of labor to the firm's real wage:
f'(L) = w/s

(2)

where w is the nominal wage and s is an index of prices received by firms.

The notional supply of labor depends on the purchasing power of the worker's
payment for an hour of work:
L =

g[w(1—T)/s(1+e)]

()

where r is the income tax rate and e is the value added tax rate. Labor
supply is unafected by any reform which does not change (i-r)/(i+G).

.

equivalence of a sales tax on all goods and a value added tax has
recognized by many -uithors. For a particularly clear discussion see

We now consider the effects of increasing 0 and reducing ,

while

leaving (i—T)/(1+0) constant. Clearly both the real wage paid by firms

of assuming that the demand for real money balances, deflated by product

prices, depends on real output. Since output is unaffected by the tax shift,
absent a change in M the after—tax price level, s(1+G), will not change. An
indirect tax increase will therefore lower s in proportion to the increase in
(i+e).

Similarly,

since w/s remains constant, the nominal wage must fall.

Alternative approaches might postulate that money demand depends on
households' disposable income, (i—r)Y, or that money balances should be

deflated by an index of consumer prices. In the former case, a revenue
neutral shift towards indirect taxation would reduce prices, while in the

latter case, it would raise them. In neither case would real output be
affected. Namkiw and Summers (1984) present some evidence suggesting the
empirical relevance of the case where money demand depends on household

expenditure. Regardless of the money demand specification, tax changes will
not affect the price level if nominal output is held constant.
Although shifts between direct and indirect taxes are neutral in this

model, increases in either are not. Combining (2) and (3) it can be seen
that reductions in (1-.t)/(i+O), which correspond to tax increases, lower

equilibri emploent and output. This may raise prices. inder (1973)

argues that prices may also be subject to a countervailing

force, since tal increases may depress aggregate demand and lower

prices. These nonneutralities, even when prices are fully flexible, make it
difficult to interpret previous empirical studies of inflation and indirect

model considered here. In a multiple—period model, strict equivalence

In an open economy, equivalence requires that sales or value added tax be

described by McClure (1983). Our Appendix demonstrates the equivalence of

direct

and indirect taxes in an extremely general context.

We illustrate this proposition by considering three

different types of nominal rigidities.

They arise both in textbook Keynesian models and in contracting models such

effects of introducing value added taxes in Eiropean countries. These policy

Some

changes are hard to interpret, however, because in many cases the VAT simply

replaced previous indirect taxes, such as turnover taxes. In other cases,
the imposition of VAT substantially raised the total direct and indirect tax
burden; this could have real effects. Other related work, such as Cordon
(1971), provides some evidence that changing payroll tax rates in the United
States are reflected in the price level. A survey of the broader literature
on

indirect

taxes and inflation may be found in Nowotny (1980).

8

by adding

a description of wage behavior to the classical model, while

deleting the requirement that notional labor supply equal notional labor

demand. Since both explicit and implicit contracts seem to be denominated in
terms of pre-tax wages, we assinne pre-tax wage rigidity. Since post-tax
wages do not need to adjust to tax shifts, rigidities in (1—r)w do not imply
that shifts between direct and indirect taxation have real effects.

Consider an increase in 0 which does not change (i—T)/(i+e). With

sticky wages, w is too high after such a shock. If firms are to remain on
their notional labor demand schedules, employment must fall or prices must

rise. In equilibrium, both occur to some extent since a fall in
employment lowers output and therefore requires an increase in s(1+0) to

satisfy (7). Keeping w constant, (1), (2) and (7) imply that the
elasticity of the tax inclusive price with respect to a tax change is:

An increase in indirect taxes is like a supply shock6, since prices rise and

output fails. Real wages also rise, inducing firms to demand less labor and

produce

less output.

A second type of rigidity is real wage resistance, which Branson
and Rotemberg (1980) and Sachs (1979) found in continental European

countries. It can arise from indexing clauses which do not contemplate

6• This term is usually applied to shocks such as increases in the price of
an imported intermediate input (see Gordon (1975), Blinder (1981), or
Rotemberg (1983b)). These shocks raise some prices, lowering real money
balances and output if prices are sticky.

tax

reforms. If wages are indexed to the consumer price index, s(1+O),

then increases in 8 will raise w/s.7 This induces firms to fire
workers, lower output, and raise prices after a revenue neutral shift toward
indirect taxation.8

We have examined the effects of two types of wage rigidity. At the cost
of some additional complexity, we could also allow for price rigidity as

urged by Blanchard (1984,1985) and Rotemberg (1982). This would not alter
the basic Keynesian prediction that revenue neutral shifts towards indirect

taxation raise prices and reduce output. Rigidities in s would lead to
increases in s(1+O) when 0 rises.9 This lowers aggregate demand and induces
firms to fire workers, possibly reducing real wages along the notional labor

supply curve.
We have isolated a clear difference in the empirical implications of

models with and without nominal rigidities. A natural way of testing for the
existence and importance of these rigidities is to examine the response of
prices and output to changes in ta.x structure, controlling for total revenue

collections. These tests, while not totally free of ambiguity, are superior
to tests of the relationship between money and output for detecting nominal

rigidities. First, tax structure changes are more likely to be exogenous

.

With real wage rigidities, an increase in indirect taxation could
trigger a period of inflation. The nature of this inflation is extremely
sensitive to assumptions about the dynamics of wage adjustment; see
Poterba, Rotemberg, and Summers (1985) for further discussion.

policy shoc than are changes in the money stock. King and Plosser (1984)
argue that changes in the money stock may be endogenous. They establish that
most of the observed correlation between money and output arises from changes
in the money multiplier, not from changes in the stock of base money.

Second, as shown in Grossman and Weiss (1935) and Rotemberg (1984), changes
in the money stock which are engineered through open market operations are

likely to have real effects even without nominal rigidities. Some tax
changes suffer from similar difficulties, because they have incentive and

distributional effects which may change real magnitudes. However, by
con.sidering increases in indirect taxes compensated by reductions in direct

taxes, we minimize these problems.

11

II. Methodolocy
We use both British and American data in studying the effects of tax

changes. Britain has experienced considerably more variation in tax
structure than the United States, and it therefore provides better tests for

the presence of nominal rigidities. Our aim is to discover whether, and how,
revenue—neutral char ;- in V jrir1 e affect prices, wages, and output. We test

for nominal rigidities with a minimal set of maintained assumptions by
studying reduced form

equations

which include a variety of standard aggregate

variables.LQ We investigate whether the mix of direct and indirect taxes
improves the explanatory power of these equations. Other variables are
included to prevent tax switches from appearing significant only because they
are correlated with relevant excluded variables.

We estimate two systems of equations. The first consists of three
reduced form equations for the logarithms of prices (p.), nominal after—tax

wages (wt(1_'rt)), and output ()•

The explanatory variables are lagged

prices, wages, and output, as well as real government deficits (di) and the

logarithm of the money stock (mt). We also include three tax variables.
The first, TTOT. is the sum

of

the direct and indirect tax rates. The second

is TMIX, the difference between the direct and indirect tax

rates.

Including

both TMIX and TTOT is equivalent to including indirect and direct taxes

separately. However, since we are interested primarily in the effect of
switches between direct and indirect taxes holding their sum

specification is more natural. The third tax

This system of equations can be thought of as

Systems (9) and (io) allow for unrestricted wage, price, and output

responses to shifts between direct and indirect taxation. Both Keynesian and
classical models imply, however, that revenue neutral tax switches are

neutral in the long run. We therefore impose long-run neutrality, while
testing for short—run TMIX effects, by restricting the sum of the TMIX

coefficients in each equation to equal zero. The short—run tax neutrality
hypothesis implies the restrictions

in system (io). As long as TMIX is a valid exogenouB variable, rejection of
H0 is very unfavorable to the classical model. In Section IV we consider
some, in our view unlikely, reasons why TMIX might appear to matter even if
wages and prices were perfectly flexible.

14

After

rejecting these null hypotheses, we focus on the relevance of

these rejections for the presence of nominal rigidities. If nominal
rigidities are present, then we expect prices to rise and output to fall for

some time after a tax switch. The response of real wages depends on whether

or wage rigidities are more important. To investigate these dy-narnic

price

effects, we compute our systems' predicted responses to a permanent change in

similar to those for permanent shocks, only the latter are reported in

The reduced forms described above may be subject to some of the

criticisms which have been directed at the vector autoregression approach of

Sims (1980). We have not posited an explicit structural model, and the
parameters

in

our reduced forms might vary with changes in the policy regime.

prices and output to changes in TMIX,

given

the current policy regime, can

shed light on the existence of nominal rigidities.
Any argument of this type must confront issues similar to those raised
in the decades—long debate about the relationship between money and output.
The essential identification problem there involves the possibility that
money and output are correlated either because they both respond to some

15

third

factor, or because changes in money are caused by expectations

of

changes in output. After presenting our empirical results, we present some
evidence supporting the exogeneity of tax changes. At a minimum, it seems
clear

that changes in the tax mix correspond to the ideal experiment for

studying nominal rigidities much more closely than do money supply changes.

16

III. The Data
This section describes our method for constructing measures of the
direct and indirect tax burden in Great Britain and the United States. It
begins by discussing conceptual measurement issues which apply to both

countries. It then considers the data for each nation in some detail.
Direct taxes are defined as taxes on individuals, including income taxes

and employee contributions for social insurance. Indirect taxes are those
collected from firms. They include sales and value added taxes, employer
contributions for social insurance, and various excise taxes. Our measured
tax rates,

and , are defined as direct and indirect tax receipts as a

share of GNP at market prices. These variables do not correspond precisely
to the actual tax rates, r and e,

of

Section I. Following the notation

there, let (1+e)E denote tax-inclusive consi.er expenditure and I household

income. Government expenditure equals G(1+e), and gross national product
measured at market prices is (1+e)(E+G). The national income identity
ensures that I = G+E.

Our measured tax rates are therefore

_______

=

(1+e)(G+E)

i+e

(11

e(G÷E)
(1+e)(G+E)

T

12

and
...

e

Both measured tax rates are slightly lower than their actual rates in
our stylized economy. This will induce a bias in our measurement of TMIX,
since
(13)

For values of e between 0 and .15, however, as in our sample, this bias is

17

small. In contrast, the measured tax rates yield exactly the correct measure
for the total tax burden, TTOT:

In Section I we discussed tax reforms which altered r or e

a tax

(1_t) =

(15

with no effect on (i-.T)/(i+®) will not change TTOT.

This approach to measuring tax rates is only one of many possibilities.

we would like our tax variables to be legislated tax rates which

government policy changes. Unfortunately, taxes are too

tax base is much less than CliP and taxes are frequntly raised or lowered

by changing the tax base. If the elasticities of direct and indirect tax
receipts with respect to CliP are different, then the the measured TTOT and

TMIX variables will be affected by cyclical fluctuations. This could lead to

a spurious correlation between the tax variables, prices, and output.
We therefore employ two other techniques for identifying shifts between

direct and indirect taxation. First, using data on full employment receipts
and CNP, we

define

full employment TMIX

and

TTOT. This purges these

variables of cyclical fluctuations. We adopted still another procedure for
identifying tax changes in the British data, by studying the response of
prices, wages, and output to dummy variables which correspond to large tax
reforms.

Although

this technique does not use all the information we have

18

about the nature of these tax reforms, it avoids the problems of spurious
correlation which may contaminate our other results.

III. A. The United Kingdom
Direct taxes in the United Kingdom consist of personal income taxes

and surtaxes, and employee's national insurance contributions. Indirect
taxes include a variety of different levies: Purchase Tax (prior to 1972)

Value Added x, stamp, customs, alcohol, and tobacco duties, car tax, as
well as employers contributions for National Insurance and Selective

Eknployment Tax. Ita on tax receipts were obtained from Financial Statistics
and unpublished tabulations provided by the Central Statistical Office. A
detailed data description is available from the authors on request.
The resulting shares of direct and indirect taxes in GDP are shown in
Table 1.

The share of indirect taxes ranges from just

over

eleven percent in

1963, to more than fifteen percent during the early 198. There are even
more significant movements in the direct tax share, which varies between 10.1

and 16.8 percent. The table also shows that there are some tax

reforms

which

correspond to shifts between the two sources of revenue. In particular, the
1979 tax

reform involved

a reduction of basic statutory income tax

rates

accompanied by systematic increases in VAT. The direct tax cuts were
forecast to reduce revenue by 4.5 billion pounds, while the increase in VAT

was expected to raise of 4.2 billion. This is the cleanest example of a tax
reform which changed the "side of the market" on which taxes are levied.12

Oir econometric techniques allow us to investigate tax reforms which are
not revenue neutral, since we include both the total tax burden as well as
the tax mix in our equations.

We

measure the British price level using the deflator for GD? at market

prices, and also report results using the Retail Price Index. Our nominal
wage measure is the index of basic weekly wage rates in all industries and

services. Output is measured by real GDP at market prices. Our equations
also include the logarithm of Ml, the deficit as measured by the Public
Sector Borrowing Requirement, and the level of other tax receipts, defined as

total government tax receipts less direct and indirect taxes.
There are several intervals of statutory wage and price controls and

implicit wage—price guidelines during our sample period

Previous

attempts

to find significant effects from price controls, for example Sargan (1980),

have been unsuccessful. Wage controls do appear to have had some impact on
wage growth, however. Henry (1981) identifies five periods of statutory wage
restraint and associated wage catch—up. We include his set of indicator
variables for wage controls in all of our British reduced form equations.1

Quarterly 'SBR and Ml data are only available since 1963, and the wage
series which we use was not computed after 1983. Our sample period is
therefore limited to the eighty—four quarters between 1963:1 and 1983:4
inclusive.
L+•
There is some disagreement regarding the most binding periods of wage
control. Gordon (1983) uses dtnnmy variables which differ from those in Henry
(1981), and Wadhwani (1983) uses yet another set. Our results were
insensitive to alternative choices. We amend Henry's (1981) variables by
adding an indicator variable for rapid wage growth in the second quarter of

1978.

III. B. The Uriite States
Direct tax receipts for the United States include federal personal
income tax receipts, state and local personal income tax receipts, and

personal contributions for social insurance. Our measure of indirect taxes
is the sum of federal indirect business taxes, which consist of both excise
taxes and customs duties, state and local sales tax receipts, and private

employer contributions for social insurance.1 Direct and indirect tax
receipts as a fraction of GNP are shown in the last two columns of Table 1.
The share of direct taxes in GNP displays substantial variability in the
post—war period, ranging from only seven percent in 1949 to nearly fifteen

percent early in the 1980s. Indirect taxes are much less volatile, ranging
between 5.7 and 8.7 percent of GNP and trending upward throughout the sample
period.
We measure the U.S. price level using both the QNP deflator and the

Urban Worker Consumer Price Index for all goods except shelter.' Wages are
measured

as average hourly

earnings in manufacturing, and output as GNP in

1972 dollars. Our equations include the logarithm

total

government deficit, and other tax receipts which are defined as total

tax receipts

of Ml, the level of the

less direct and indirect taxes.

We also include two variables

from Gordon and King (1982) to allow for the impact of wage and price

controls during the early 1 97G.

1b• We excluded state and local government employer contributions from our
calculation of social insurance contributions by employers.

b• The CPI's treatment of mortgage interest is widely regarded as a Bource
of spurious movement. We therefore exclude the shelter component.

IV.

Findings

This section reports three sets of estimates of how switches between

direct and indirect taxation affect nominal wages, prices, and output. The

first sub—section focuses on the iact of the 1979 Thatcher experinnt in
Great Britain, because it is the clearest example of a switch between direct

and indirect taxation. We then consider the British experience more
generally, using the TMIX variable discussed in the last section. Tne third

sub—section reports results using post—war Anrican data. The section closes
with a discussion of several qualifications to our findings.

IV. A. A Major Episode of Tax Reform: The Thatcher Experiment
The Conservative Budget on .June 12, 1979 called for: (i) reducing the

basic rate of income tax, the rate paid by virtually all British workers,

from 33

to

30 percent; (ii) raising income tax

personal

allowances, the

analogue of deductions in the United States; (iii) reducing top income tax
rates from 83 to 60 percent; and (iv) raising Value Added Tax rates, which

were previously either 8.5 or 12.5 percent, to 15 percent. This is therefore
very

similar to our ideal "tax

switch"

experiment. 17

This tax reform is widely thought to have generated substantial

inflationary prssure in the second half of 1979. Buiter and Miller (1981)
suggest that:

"... the rate
third quarter

of inflation increased sharply in the
of 1979 as a direct consequence of the
seven percent increase in the VAT in the June budget,
which was estimated to have added about four points
to the average level of prices... Given the convention
of effectively indexing annual pay claims for past
inflation, there can be little doubt that the increase

17 The Value Added Tax applies to roughly half of consuirr expenditure in
Great Britain.

23

of the value added tax in June 1979 helped to keep tne
pace of settleints at a high level in the subsequent pay
round.

Previous attents to estiite the inflationary effects of the 1979 reform
have multiplied the change in indirect tax rates for aifferent categories of

goods by the share of consuiir expenditure in each category. This approach
assumes that pre—VAT prices are not affected by the policy change. Moreover,
it ignores the data on what actually occurred in the second and third
quarters of 1979.

Our technique for analyzing this tax shift is to include indicator
variables for the quarters around the change in tax regime in our wage,

price, and output equations, and then to use these estimated coefficients to

assess the reform's impact.18 We include indicator variables for both the
quarter of the change and several quarters thereafter. 'This avoids imposing
dyuam.ics which we estimate from the rest of the sample on the 1979
experience.

Estimates of equation systs (9) and (10), including the dumn
variables for the 1979 tax shock, are reported in Appendix Table A-i. They
employ British data for the 1963—1983 period. Both sets of estimates suggest
the importance of the 1979 changes in affecting prices, wages, and output.
To test the short-run tax neutrality hypothesis, we test the null hypothesis
that DU}1793 does not belong in our equation systems. The test statistic for

excluding DUN793 is 41.1 for system (9), and 13.7 for system (1O).19 These

The budget change occurred on June 12, 1979. We define a variable equal
to 0 before 1979:2, 1/6 for 1979:2, and 1 thereafter to indicate the presence
of the post—1979 regime. The quarterly difference in this variable, called
our regression variable.

test statistics are distributed as x2(9) and x2(b), respectively, uncer the

null hypothesis. In both cases, we reject the exclusion restrictions at the
.05 confidence level; in system (9), the rejection is also clear at the .01
level.

To investigate the dynamic effects of the 1979 tax change, we compute
impulse response functions for prices, wages, and output with respect to an
increase in DUM793.

Because the response functions for systems (9) and

(io)

were similar, we report only those for system (9). Figure I shows both the
point estimates for these impulse response functions, and also reports the
one

standard error band around these estimates.20
The response functions show the significant movenEnts of wages, prices,

and output after a shock like the 1979 tax reform. The price level rises at
the time of the tax reform by about four percent and it continues rising for
eight

additional quarters.21 At the peak, prices are 8.7 percent higher

than they were before the tax reform; recall that with fixed pretax prices,

the price level would have risen roughly four percent. Beginning ten
quarters after the shock, prices decline. The null hypothesis that the price
effect is zero can be rejected at the .05 level in each of the first ten
quarters

after the change.22

2o The standard errors for the impulse response functions are computed
using standard asymptotic methods. Defining f(&,t) as the impulse response
function t periods after the shock, and a the coefficient estimates from (9),
we compute the variance of f(&,t) as Vf' Q Vf, where Vf is the vector of
derivatives of 1' with respect to &, and Q is the covariance matrix of z.

21 This pattern of price dynamics suggests the presence of price
stickiness, as well as possible wage rigidity.

22• The sum of the price deviations for ten quarters after the shock is 77.6
percent. The hypothesis that this s equals zero can be rejected at the .01
confidence level.

shows tha4 real wages fall at the time

of

the tax shock.

Thereafter, they rise for two quarters and reach a point two percent above

their initial level. They then converge to the new steady state in an
oscillatory fashion. This appears inconsistent with wage stickiness alone.
On the contrary it suggests that firms,

unwilling

to lower the prices they

receive, move down the supply curve for labor. Output also follows an
oscillatory pattern after the tax change. Although the rise in output
immediately following the shock is puzzling, output eventually declines by a

substantial amount. After twelve quarters, output is nearly three percent
below its starting value. These output deviations are statistically
significant at standard levels.23

Two problems could affect our results. Lrst, 1979 was a period of
dramatic price change world wide as a result of substantial oil price

increases. Some part of the price effect which we attribute to the tax
reform may, therefore, be spurious. Although the most substantial oil price
shocks occurred in the last quarter of 1979, well after the tax change, some

contamination could occur nonetheless. To control for the effect of oil
price changes, we added the logarithm of the Wholesale Price Index for Crude

Oil to our equations. This variable had a t—statistic exceeding four, but
its inclusion df not alter our conclusions about the 1979 tax reform.
The second problem is that evidence based on only one event, such as
this, is especially prone to contamination by omitted variables.

which, while not as

percent VAT rates on durables, the government, reduced them

to

percent. This should have lowered the tax—inclusive price level. When we
add indicator variables for these changes to

our

equations, we can easily

reject the null hypothesis that they have zero coefficients. The results
suggest a substantial downward effect on prices after tne tax change. All of
the results on the 1979 and 1976 tax changes are robust with respect to

changes in the price level variable; equations estimated with the Retail

after the tax change, the sum of the deviation of prices from their initial

with the U.S. experience. Appendix Table A—3 presents estimates of systems

For system (10), the two—

implies rejection at the .01 level. These findings provide strong evidence
for the presence of wage or price stickiness in the United States. To
illustrate effects which these rigidities imply for tax changes, we now

consider impulse response functions for prices, wages, and output. In both
systems, we clearly reject the null hypothesis that the tax mix variables

have zero coefficients. The test statistics again imply rejections at the

.01 level. Our discussion will focus on estimates which use the GNP deflator

additional quarter, and then decline monotonically to their initial level.
Adjustment is slow; even five years after the tax shock, real wages are .13
percent above their initial level.

Output experiences a pronounced decline after an increase in indirect

taxation. A one percent rise in TMIX induces a .2 percent drop in real GNP
in the quarter of the tax change. The path of output thereafter depends upon
the choice between systems (9) and (10). In (9), the three equation system,
output continues to decline for another quarter and falls to .45 percent

below its initial level before starting to return to its initial level. The
sum of the output effects up to ten quarters after the change is —4.120, with

a standard error of 2.731. The results for (10) suggest that the amount of
lost output declines after the first quarter, although output returns to its

initial level very slowly. The ten—quarter sum equals —2.903 (2.951). Both
sets of results are consistent with the view that nominal wages are sticky,

since the insufficient nominal wage decline in response to indirect tax

increases raises real wages and induces firms to lay off workers. This has
the ultimate effect of lowering real money balances.
Our

findings

are insensitive to several specification changes.

Fcluding Gordon and King's (1982) wage—price control variables has little
effect on the e'stimated coefficients and iipulse response functions. Adding
interest rates, exchange rates, and further lagged values of the currently
included variables also has little substantive impact on our conclusions.

The central finding, that the short—run tax neutrality hypothesis is strongly
rejected, obtains in a wide variety of specifications.

These results can also be used to study the inact of revenue—raising
tax increases. Raising the total tax burden permanently, while keeping TMIX
constant, increases prices and real wages and causes a drop in output. A one

37

percent increase in TTOT raises prices by .38 percent, and real wages by .26

percent, in the first quarter. itput declines by .8 percent when the shock
occurs, and continues to fall thereafter. By

eight

quarters after tne tax

increase, output is 1.65 percent below its starting value. These findings,
while suggestive, are accompanied by large standard errors and should
therefore be interpreted with caution.

IV.

D. Qualifications
Pwo potentially important assuniptions underlie our use of the TMIX

variable to test for the existence of nominal rigidities. First, we assume
that TMIX is exogenous in our reduced form equation systems. Second, we
postulate

in

that except for the effects of wage and price stickiness, changes

TMIX should have no iact on prices or output. The possible failure of

parallel assumptions has caused

debate about the interpretation of linkages

between money and output. We consider each assuition in turn.
Several arguments might be constructed to suggest that our tax mix

variable is not exogenous. Perhaps most plausibly, it might be noted that if
the output elasticities
changes

in

of direct and indirect taxes are different, then

real output will induce changes in TiiIX. Price shocks may be

transmitted to'GNP and

tnen to TNIX as

well. This issue is partly addressed

by our inclusion of lagged output in the reduced form systems, and by our
separate examination of the 1979 and 1976 policy changes in Great Britain.

As a further check, we use data on cyclically adjusted revenue collections26

Full employment data are not available for the U.K. on a quarterly

important source of endogeneity for the receipts—based tax measures.27

context which generated changes in TMIX does not support these views. The
1979 tax reform in Great Britain immediately followed an election which was

decided on grounds other than tax policy. The avowed purpose of its
proponents was to improve incentives through reductions in marginal income

tax rates. In the United States, most of the variation in indirect taxes
comes from movements in state sales taxes and employer payroll taxes.
Neither of these are likely to be manipulated for macroeconomic purposes.
More generally, it seems unlikely that governments systematically shift
towards indirec't taxes when they foresee rising prices, or when they intend

to pursue more expansionary monetary policy. The 1979 re(orrn in Britain was

accoan.ied by an announced policy of monetary restraint. Nothing in the

always similar, the resemblence between our equations for the 1948—1984

depended upon our choice of price series. The equations using the shelter—

those using the GNP deflator are substantially different.

history of eitner British or American tax policy suggests that tax changes

should help to forecast future monetary policies. This inference is
consistent with the failure of Granger causality tests to reject the
hypothesis that TMIX does not cause either money or TTOT.
The second potential objection to our tests is that TMIX might have
effects on output and prices through channels other than wage and price

rigidities. Such a possibility cannot be ruled out, since changes in TMIX do
not correspond precisely to our theoretical model. Indirect taxes do not
cover all goods, and direct taxes are not strictly proportional.
Nonetheless, it is difficult to explain our findings along these lines.

Increases in indirect taxes coupled with equal revenue decreases in direct

taxes are usually though to improve incentives to work and invest. Since
indirect taxes are also less progressive than direct taxes, they should have

smaller disincentive effects. Thus, they should raise output and reduce
prices ——

Conclusions

A major thrust of much recent macroeconomic research has been the
elucidation of business cycles as equilibria of competitive economies with

fully flexible prices. Theories in both the "misperceptions" and "real

business cycle" traditions emphasize the assption of perfect price
flexibility and the resulting absence of unexploited opportunities for

beneficial exchange. These theories imply strong data restrictions: fully
perceived changes in government policy which do not change any agent's

opportunity set should have no real effects. In contrast, the essence of
contemporary Keynesian thinking is ttiat prices are in some sense sticky, so
certain purely nominal disturbances ao matter.

The difficulty in exirically distinguishing these theories arises from
the problem of isolating purely nominal disturbances. Traditionally, they
have been tested by examining the relationship between variously—measured

monetary shocks and real variables. These tests have not been entirely
conclusive because a variety of rationalizations, with very

different

structural implications, can be offered for the comovement of money and
output.

In this paper, we rely on tax shocks of a special sort to distinguish
between classi&al and Keynesian models. A clear implication of microeconoxxiic

theory with flexible prices is that the side of the market on which a tax is

collected does not influence its ultimate real effects. Tax changes between
direct

and indirect taxation therefore provide a natural experiment for

examining the importance of nominal rigidities. The appeal of the experiment
is enhanced by the apparently unsystematic way in which taxes have varied.

The results of our investigation lead us to decisively reject the
classical view that wages and prices are perfectly flexible. While arguments

measure would raise about 4.2 billion dollars for each one dollar per

barrel tax. Thus a five dollar a barrel tax would raise the indirect tax
burden by 21 billion dollars. Our estimates suggest that if monetary policy
were not altered, this would result in lost output of sixty billion dollars

over the succeeding decade. Similar estimates are obtained assuming that
monetary policy acts to keep nominal GNP constant following the tax reform.
These figures bulk large relative to allocative effects traditionally

enthasized in microeconomic analyses of excise tax reforms. Proposals to tax
only marginal suppliers of goods, such as the proposed surtax on oil imports,
would have much greater output effects per dollar of revenue raised.
Some might argue that it is inappropriate to assess the output effects

of tax reforms while holding monetary policy constant, since monetary policy

could accommodate tax changes. This issue is treated in Poterba, Rotemberg
and Summers (1985). Note, however, that if the monetary authority has set
monetary policy to trade off unemployment and inflation in a desirable way
prior to tax reform, the loss of welfare from a small tax change will be

independent of the monetary policy response. Unless one believes that

Our finding

that shifts towards indirect taxation have adverse

macroeconomic consequences raises an obvious question. Could macroeconomic

performance be improved by reducing indirect taxes and increasing direct

taxes? The conscious and regular use of such tax policies as stabilization
measures

would be such a significant change in policy regime that our

4
estimates cannot shed much light on this issue. However, they do suggest
that such a change might well improve the tradeoff between unemployment and

inflation on a one-shot basis. The gains might be taken either in the form
of reduced inflation or increased output. Poterba, Rotemberg and Summers
(1985) demonstrate that if output is held constant, tax changes may well have
a permanent effect on the rate of inflation.

Our results suggest a number of directions for future research. The
robustness of our conclusions might be examined by studying tax changes in

other countries or in individual American states. Structural estimation
might yield more precise information on the nature of wage and price

stickiness, and

reforims might facilitate identification of these

models. The effects of alternative policy responses to large tax reforms
might also be considered. Perhaps most importantly, our results isolate a
major class of apparent rigidities which economic theory needs to explain.

APPENDIX

This appendix demonstrates the widespread applicability of the

neutrality results discussed in Section I. First, we show thak value added
taxes and income taxes are equivalent in a multiperiod econonw when there are

only spot markets for consuntion and capital. At time t, households can
purchase a consumption vector

pay a wage

The government taxes all value added at rate 0,

so households

pay

(1+e)p for consumption goods and (i+0)q for claims on capital. Investment
goods are not exempt from the VAT; exempting them would be equivalent to an

investment tax credit. Households pay income taxes on the wages and interest

income which they receive, but there is no capital gains tax. The

household's budget constraint at t is therefore:

= (wL+rK1)(I

—

t)/(1

+

0).

(A.1)

Relative prices at time t, and governnt revenue, depend only

on

(i—)/(i+e). We aist also show that intertemporal prices depend only on the
tax
and

factor

(i—)/(i+e). By

capital, and consuming the proceeds at

t+1, the household obtains (pt/pt+i)(rt+i +
at t+1. This depends only on 6 and

the

(1—o)q1)/q units of

the good

prices facing firms, which depend

only on (1_)/(i+e). This completes the demonstration of equivalence.
Second, we show the euivalence between sales and income taxes in an
econoity with complete contingent claims markets, as in the real business

cycle literature (Long and Plosser (983), for example). Goods are indexed
by time

and state of nature. Suppose that all trade is intermediated by

firms, which charge prices P for the goods they sell. The vector of
household purchases is Q,

while

the vector of household sales to firms is V.

Let W be the vector of prices the firms pay the households for the goods they

purchase. We consider an income tax r levied on all state contingent sales
by households, and a sales tax 0 levied on all state contingent sales by

firms. The household's lifetime budget constraint can then be written as
(1 +

e)P.Q =

(1

— r)W.V.

Firm's decisions depend only

on

P and W, while

household's actions depend on P, W and (1—r)/(i+0). To show that sales and
income taxes are equivalent it therefore suffices to shaw that government

revenue also depends only on (i—r)/(1+0). Tax receipts from the private
sector equal T = OP.Q + tW.V, which may be written as
T =

[e

+ ] w.v

=

[i

—

w.v.

(A.2)

This completes the equivalence proof.
This result generalizes to an econoiry in which sales and income taxes

are not levied on all state contingent transactions, but only on those

transactions which take place after states of nature are realized, under two

conditions. First, there must be a complete set of Arrow—Debreu securities
which pay one dollar at time t if state a is realized. Second, the "income"
from these securities imist be untaxed. A more detailed discussion is
available frrom the authors on request.
