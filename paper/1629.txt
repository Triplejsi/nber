Borrowing Restrictions and Wealth
Constraints: Implications for
Aggregate Consumption

ABSTRACT

Recent empirical studies have found that consumption is more sensitive to
current income than the life-cycle, permanent income hypothesis would predict.

The present paper studies a model in which the fraction of consumers
exhibiting excess sensitivity is endogenously determined. The presence of

income uncertainty and restrictions on borrowing are shown to generate a
distribution of consumption across individuals which is consistent with the
recent empirical evidence. The aggregate marginal propensity to consume out

of transitory income is directly related to the fraction of constrained
consumers and exhibits positive serial correlation in the face of serially
uncorrelated income shocks.

Borrowing Restrictions and Wealth Constraints:
Implications for Aggregate Consumption

Recent empirical research suggests that the observed co-movements of
income and consumption are consistent with some fraction of consumption

being determined in a manner compatible with the life-cycle, permanent
income hypothesis and the remaining fraction being proportional to in-

come. Hall and Mishkin [1982], for example, investigated the consumption of food using panel data on households and concluded that 80% of
consumption obeys the permanent income hypothesis, while 20% is simply

proportional to income.' In a study of aggregate consumption, Hayashi
[1982] obtains a point estimate of the share of disposable income going
to liquidity constrained households of 17.1%, although he cannot reject
the null hypothesis that this fraction is zero. Using consumer expenditures in place of consumption, Hayashi estimates that 96% of such expen-

ditures are attributable to liquidity constrained households.2 Hansen
and Singleton [1983] are able to reject the restrictions implied by the
first order Euler equations obtained from a standard specification of a

life-cycle consumption choice problem, and Zeldes [1984] presents evidence to suggest that the violation of these restrictions is due to the
presence of liquidity constrained households.

In addition, Ferson and

Merrick [1985] report that the evidence against the Euler restrictions
is strongest in periods of aggregate economic recession.

If aggregate consumption is the sum of consumption by liquidity con-

strained households and consumption by unconstrained households, then
the aggregate marginal propensity to consume out of transitory income

-1â€”

should be an average of one (for the constrained individuals) and a
small positive number (for the unconstrained) with weights dependent on

the fraction of all consumers who actually are constrained. It is un-

fortunate then that there currently appears to be no model which explains the determinants of the percentage of households which fall into
each class. For example, previous studies of optimal consumption in the

presence of capital market imperfections (e.g. Flemming [1973], Heller
and Starr [1979] )3 have not explicitly modeled the probability that a
given individual will be constrained nor considered the determinants of
the aggregate fraction of consumers who are constrained. This paper at-

tempts to at least partially fill this gap. The approach adopted is to
study the distribution of assets across households when there are borrowing restrictions and income uncertainty. It is shown that each peri-

od a positive fraction of the population of consumers will find themselves wealth constrained, while the remaining fraction will not be so
constrained and will appear to behave according to the life-cycle, per-

manent income hypothesis. The aggregate marginal propensity to consume
out of transitory income is shown to be directly related to the fraction

of all consumers who are wealth constrained, and this fraction is shown
to exhibit positive serial correlation in response to serially unc.orrelated income disturbances.

To constrast sharply with the perfect capital market assumption of
the standard permanent income formulation, the model developed here as-

sumes that consumers cannot borrow against any future income receipts.

Current consumption is therefore limited by current resources. Excess
sensitivity of aggregate consumption then arises because some consumers

-2-

find their current wealth to be insufficient to finance their desired
level of consumption. The evidence from the rec.ent Survey of Consumer

Finances [1984] suggests that a significant fraction of American fami-

lies have levels of financial asset holdings which, in the absence of
the ability to borrow against future labor income, would be insufficient

to insulate consumption from even moderate declines in current income.
F'or example, in 1983, 12% of all families, and 34% of those with incomes

less than $10,000, reported no financial assets. Almost 40% of all fam-

ilies reported fiiiancial asset holdings of less than $10O0. It seems
quite plausible to expect that consumption for a nonnegligible fraction

of the population would be forced to move quite closely with fluctuations in current income.

The basic choice problem facing the individual consumer is similar to

that analyzed by Sibley [1975], Schechtman [1976], Schechtman and Escudero [1977], and Bewley [1977], and their results will be drawn upon.

The focus of these authors has been the optimal consumption plan of an
individual consumer facing income uncertainty.5 In the formulations of

Schechtman [1976 and Bewley [1977], for example, no borrowing is allowed. They both show, however, that in the limit as the individual's
planning horizon goes to infinity and the subjective rate of time pref-

erence goes to zero, the consumer holds enough wealth to completely
self-insure against any income fluctuations. In this case, the borrow-

ing restriction is never binding. As will be discussed in section I,
this result would seem to be inconsistent with the empirical evidence.
In addition, none of these authors consider the aggregate implications
of borrowing restrictions.

-3-

The present paper, like those of Lucas [1980] and Clarida [l984J, is

directed towards the aggregate implications of the consumer's choice
problem. Both Lucas [1980} and Clarida [1984] find that the distribution function of money balances (the single asset in their models) has a

mass point at the minimum value necessary to finance consumption. By
providing a new interpretation of this characteristic of the distribu-

tion of asset holdings, the present paper shows how the empirical resuits found by Hall and Mishkin [1982], Hayashi [1982] and Flavin [1984]

might arise. The contribution of the present paper, besides providing a
reinterpretation of earlier results which is consistent with recent empirical findings, is to examine the determinants of the fraction of con-

sumers who are wealth constrained. In addition, by assuming that transitory income fluctuations have both an individual specific and a common

(business cycle) component, it is shown how the aggregate excess sensitivity of consumption to transitory income is generated as a function of
the endogenously determined fraction of consumers who are constrained.

The consumer's basic choice problem is discussed in the next section,

and the optimal consumption plan of the individual is studied. Section
II shows that the distribution of wealth across individuals converges to

a unique stationary distribution when income shocks are individual spe-

cific and aggregate transitory income is zero.

This distribution is

used to derive the fraction of consumers who will become wealth constrained each period.

Optimal consumption and the distribution of

wealth with a wealth in advance requirement are compared, in section
III, to the outcomes which would arise if borrowing were allowed. Ag-

gregate consumption in the presence of an economy-wide component to

The Individual Consumer

This section sets up the problem facing each consumer and shows that

there is a critical value of spendable resources such that consumers
with assets less than this value are wealth constrained. The consumer's

choice problem is fairly standard (see Sibley [1975], Yaari [1976],
Schechtman [1976], Bewley [1977], Schechtman and Escudero [1977], Lucas
[1980], Clarida [1984]). Consequently, the proofs of some of the propo-

sitions are omitted. The focus of the present analysis, unlike that of
earlier work, is on deriving the probability an individual will find the
restriction against borrowing to be binding.

The economy studied consists of a large number of identical, inf initely lived individuals. Only one asset, assumed for simplicity to be

noninterest bearing, is available to wealth holders, and current consumption must be financed by either beginning of period holdings of this

asset or current income receipts. The asset can be thought of as nondepreciating storage, although Bewley [1980], Lucas [1980] and Clarida
[1984] prefer to call it money. Individuals have preferences given by

shock common to all individuals. Let the cumulative distribution functions of E. and u be given by S( ) and G( ), respectively. While the

In addition, it is as-

so that each individual's endowment is strict-

ly positive for all possible realizations of transitory income.

Because c and u are i.i.d., the consumer cares only about their sum.

This would not be the case, for example, if either were Markov with
transition probabilities dependent on the current realizations. Even
though each individual's consumption depends only on C

+ u,

the distinc-

tion between individual specific and common transitory income will be
needed in order to consider how aggregate consumption responds to aggre-

If the individual's asset holdings, A, are identified with money, equa-

tion (2) is a cash-in-advance constraint. The practical implication of
(2) is that current income can be spent in the current period but future

income cannot. Each individual enters the current period with a level

of wealth determined by past income realizations and spending flows.
The individual then observes ,

the current shock to income. A level of

current consumption is then chosen. Finally, the consumer carries over

This implies that the consumer

strained consumers. Hansen and Singleton [1983] find, using data on aggregate U.S. consumption, that they can reject the null hypothesis that

sumers, and the presence of such constrained individuals may explain the

results Hansen and Singleton obtain. Such an interpretation is supported by the empirical work of Zeldes [1984].

In order for the presence of borrowing restrictions to explain these

empirical results, it is necessary to verify that there will be some
consumers for whom (2) actually is a binding constraint. Otherwise,

u(c') =

u(c)

for all consumers, and Zeldes' [19841 results could not

be captured in the present model. For example, Schechtman [1976] and

It will be useful to have an explicit representation of optimal consumption behavior by the individual consumer.

one as w and w both increase by the same amount as the rise in A*.
Thus, the probability of being constrained in nondecreasing in A*.

As of yet, it has not been shown that any consumers will have levels

of wealth less than w. It could be the case that all consumers accumulate enough wealth to insure that the borrowing constraint never binds.

For all consumers, the probability of being constrained would then be
zero. For example, it has already been mentioned that in a similar mod-

Alternatively, if A* = 0, the constraint never binds since A cannot

sult depended on the assumption that u(y+) < .

Suppose instead that

the endowment can equal zero with positive probability. Then, since

consumer will insure that spendable resources exceed zero

by always consuming strictly less than A if there is any probability of

Since F( )

a nondecreasing function, F() is nondecreasing in y.

A rise in future permanent income leads to a rise in current desired

consumption. With current spendable resources fixed, this rise in desired consumption tends to increase the probability that the constraint
(2) will be binding. The probability of becoming constrained in the fu-

ture is

also

affected by decisions about consumption in the current

period. For consumers who are not constrained in the current period, a
decision to increase current consumption will increase the probability

of becoming constrained in the next period. This probability is given

II. The Distribution of Assets With No Common Shock

ed usefulness for understanding aggregate consumption. This is because

ers who will actually be constrained is derived for the case in which

there is no aggregate uncertainty. All income shocks are taken to be
idiosyncratic, with the common shock, u, identically zero. The case in
which u has a nondegenerate distribution is considered in section IV.

This is just a standard inventory result â€”

it

is never optimal to

reduce the probability of stocking out to zero. In the present context,
it implies that a positive fraction of all consumers will find the bor-

rowing restriction binding. The remaining fraction, 1 -

r,

will be un-

cons trained.

The result that r > 0 is an immediate consequence of the facts that
A* .> 0 and A < .

If

A were equal to zero, no consumer would ever be

constrained, while if A =

, all

consumers completely self insure

against fluctuations in income. As Figure 2 shows, the assumption that
y -f

ing wealth constraint in the stationary state if A , as in the models

of Schechtman [1976] and Bewley [1977]. However, A =

holds only in

(See, for example, Schechtman [1976, p. 240].), a

case ruled out in the present analysis. The role of the assumption that

consumers discount future expected utility ( < 1) is apparent in the
proof of Proposition 10.

Equation (13) suggests that changes in any of the factors exogenous
to the model can potentially affect the fracti,on.-of constrained consurn-

ers in either of two ways. First, for a given distribution of A across

the population of consumers, anything which affects A will cause F to
change. Second, if the stationary state distribution of A is affected,
r will also change..

For example, for a given 'Y( ),

Proposition

8 im-

plies that a rise in y will increase A, by increasing desired current
consumption, and cause 1' to rise. However, a rise in real permanent in-

come will also shift the distribution of wealth to the right.

In the

new steady state, fewer consumers will have levels of spendable resourc-

es less than or equal to any given value of A. This fall in the frac-

tion of consumers with low A's will tend to reduce r. The net effect
depends on the relative magnitudes of these two opposing influences. In

the special case of constant relative risk aversion and income shocks
proportional to permanent income, the steady state fraction of consumers
who become constrained is independent of the level of permanent income:

III. Consumption With and Without a Borrowing Restriction

Unconstrained consumers, those with A

A*, appear to be choosing

consumption in a manner consistent with the standard form of the life-

cycle, permanent income hypothesis. For them, the first order Euler
equations are satisfied with equality. This does not imply that unconstrained consumers, in a wealth-in-advance world, behave identically to
consumers in a world where borrowing against future income is possible.
In this section, the optimal consumption function derived in section I,

c(A), and the stat.ionary distribution of a, 'Y*(A), will be compaed to
the outcomes which would arise if borrowing were allowed.

Schechtman and Escudero [1977] provide some results which are relevant for a comparison of optimal consumption with and without a borrowing constraint. Let c'(A) be the optimal consumption function of a con-

sumer with spendable resources A who maximizes (1) subject to (3) and

the solvency condition lim tAt

Escudero [1977, p. 160] implies that

Proposition 13: c(A)

c' (A) for all A.

- 21 -

At each level of A, a consumer in a wealth-in-advance economy consumes no more than a similar consumer not faced with the constraint (2).

Because consumers facing borrowing restrictions are unable to borrow to
maintain consumption in the face of a low realization of transitory in-

come, they will tend to consume less, as a function of A, for two rea-

sons. First, if A < A*, they are directly constrained by (2) and are
forced to consume less than they desire. Second, they will tend to con-

sume less even when unconstrained in order to accumulate wealth as a
means of insuring against low realizations of transitory income. This
results in a distribution of A that is to the right of that which would
arise in a stationary state in the absence of (2). This is proven in

IV.

Aggregate Consumption With a Common Income Shock

It order to derive the stationary distribution of assets, it was necessary to suppress the common income shock, u, which had originally been

introduced in section I.

However, in order to analyze how aggregate

consumption responds to transitory fluctuations in aggregate income, it

is necessary to reintroduce u. This implies, however, that the distribution of spendable resources across the population will vary over time
as a function of the realizations of u.

Suppose tit(Avt) is the fraction of consumers with spendable resources

less than or equal to Alt at time t. The fraction with resources less
than or equal to A1t at. time t+1, 'i'+1(A"), is given by

=

Thus,

(14)

depends on the actual realization of the aggregate income

shock at time t+l. Since SC )

is

nondecreasing, a higher

shifts

the entire distribution of AÃ·i to the right: YÃ·1(A) is nondecreasing
in

Since the fraction of constrained consumers is equal to the fraction

with spendable resources less than A*, r will now vary in response to
transitory aggregate income shocks as such shocks affect the distribution of A.

It is necessary, then, to add a time subscript to r:

- 23

-

=

From the definition of A in equation (9), it is clear that A*
depends on the probability distribution of the common shock (since' ' =

c'

+

Ut), but

the period t

A is independent of the current realization of u. Thus,

realization

of u affects Ft only through its effect on

the distribution of A* across consumers.

Proposition 15: The fraction of constrained consumers is a nonincreasing function of the contemporaneous aggregate income shock.

Proof: Since S( )

is

a nondecreasing cumulative distribution func-

tion, equation (14) implies

ar/au =

= -J

St[A-u-A-y-c(A))di(A)

Not surprisingly, a positive transitory income shock that is common
to all consumers increases the level of spendable resources available to
each consumer and thereby reduces the fraction of consumers who find the
borrowing restriction to be binding.

Even though the shocks are i.i.d., they induce a pattern of serial

correlation in I'. For example, a positive u. reduces Ft and shifts
to the right, relative to the outcomes which would result if aggre-

gate transitory income were zero. The shift in TÃ·1 implies a fall in
=

r+1.

A positive income shock, because it is partially

-24-

saved, leaves consumers with more assets in the next period. This reduces the probability an individual will become constrained, and, in the
aggregate the fraction actually constrained falls.

Proposition 16: rÃ·1 is nonincreasing in Ut.

Proof: Integrating (14) by parts yields

= S[A*-Ay+c(A)] + J S'[A-A-y+c(A)][l-c'(A)]T(A)
where A is the minimum A such that 'f(A) = 1.

Differentiating with re-

spect to

= J

since

0

< 0.

Heller and Starr [1979) show that individual consumers facing a bind-

ing liquidity constraint exhibit excess sensitivity to transitory in-

come. The empirical evidence cited in the introduction suggested that
aggregate consumption displays such excess sensitivity. Aggregate per
capita consumption, C, is given by

C r c(A)dT(A)
=

where A

+

2 AdT(A)

0 is defined such that ''(A)

J

c(A)dt(A)

The contribution to

(15)

of

the constrained consumers is equal to J' Ad(A), while the unconstrained contribute f c(A)d(A). All consumers with A < A* are con-

strained. However, since the realizations of transitory income are partially individual specific, not all consumers who begin the period with

equal values of w are constrained (unless w <

w*).

In general, the

fraction of all consumers with wealth w who become constrained is

F((w,A)) =

S((w,A)-u).

The marginal propensity to consume out of

wealth is equal to one for the constrained group. The second term in
(15) is the consumption of those consumers whose initial wealth plus
current income exceeds A*.

From Proposition 3, such individuals will

not be constrained during the current period.

To assess the excess sensitivity of consumption in the presence of
borrowing restrictions, consider two individuals, i and j, who begin the

period with the same level of wealth: w.

w.. Suppose the transitory

income realizations are such that w.+y+. < A* <

w.+y+.,

constrained while j is not. Since c'(A) < 1 for all A

=
in

1

for A <

so that i is

A*, while c'(A)

A*, individual i clearly responds more to a small variation

than does j. In addition, the binding wealth constraint will make

i less sensitivity to variations in future permanent income.

(See Hell-

er and Starr [1979].) The presence of constrained consumers will make
aggregate consumption more sensitive to current transitory income and
less sensitive to future expected income.

From (15), the aggregate marginal propensity to consume out of current aggregate transitory income can be written as

=

=

(A)

+

cA(A)dT(A)

+ '2 cA(A)dT(A).

-

26 -

(16)

The marginal propensity to consume out of transitory income depends directly on the fraction of consumers facing a, binding borrowing restric-

tion. Since income shocks have all been assumed to be i.i.d., one might
expect the second term in (16) to be close to zero.9 Then the aggregate

marginal propensity to consume out of transitory income is simply a
measure of the fraction of consumers who are constrained and is not a
measure of the slope of any representative consumer's optimal consumption function.

Equation (16) is an intuitively obvious result:

if aggregate con-

sumption is the sum of consumption by liquidity constrained households
and consumption by unconstrained households, the aggregate marginal pro-

pensity to consume out of transitory income is an average of one and a

small positive number, with weights dependent on the fraction of all
households who actually are constrained. The second term in (16) is not
quite 1 - t' times a constant since unconstrained households haye differing levels of wealth and marginal propensities to consume out of transi-

tory income. The preceding analysis, however, suggests that it is not
legitimate to model aggregate consumption as an average of the consumption of a representative constrained household and the consumption of a

representative unconstrained household with fixed weights.

The weight

in such an average is itself a function of aggregate transitory income.
r

falls

in response to positive transitory income and rises in response

to negative transitory income. Since the aggregate marginal propensity
to consume is an increasing function of r,

it

will be less than

the val-

ue that would be implied by the use of a fixed, cyclical average, value

for

r.

V. Conclusions

A number of recent empirical studies have re-evaluated the permanent

income-life cycle model of consumption using the insights provided by

the assumption of rational expectations.

These studies, using both

cross-sectional panel arid time series data from the U.S., generally re-

ject the implications of the standard formulation of the optimal consumption choice problem. Instead, the data seems to be consistent with
the presence of some consumers who face binding borrowing restrictions.

come uncertainty in which, each period, some fraction of all consumers

do face a binding constraint which limits their current consumption.
Even though all consumers are prohibited from borrowing against future

income, the behavior of some consumers appears consistent with the
life-cycle, permanent income hypothesis. Aggregate consumption is an
average of the consumption of these two groups. The model would seem to

be consistent with the empirical results obtained by Hall and Flishkin
[1982], Hayashi [1982], and Flavin [1984].

Allowing for a common, transitory income shock, it was shown that the

aggregate marginal propensity to consume is directly related to the
fraction of all consumers who are constrained. Since this fraction was
shown to exhibit positive serial correlation in response to i.i.d. income shocks, consumption will be correlated will both current and lagged
transitory income.

The analysis has been predicated on the assumption that individuals
are unable to borrow against their future endowments. This restriction

- 28

-

on borrowing is designed to capture the intuitive notion that individuals are limited in their ability to borrow against future labor income.
The assumption that no borrowing is possible is made to contrast sharply
with the standard life-cycle formulation which allows consumers, if they

so desire, to divorce consumption completely from the time pattern of
income. While not crucial for present purposes, for other issues it may

be important to model explicitly the underlying factors which make it
difficult for individuals to issue unsecured liabilities against their

future labor income. For example,. if permanent income is individual
specific and unobservable, credit rationing may arise along the lines
analyzed by Stiglitz and Weiss [1981).
