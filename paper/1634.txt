Small Countries in Monetary Unions:
A Two—Tier Model

ABSTRACT

In a previous analysis of the West African Monetary Union, Macedo
(1985a), size is taken to be a major structural characteristic of a

country in the sense that large countries are not affected by disturbances
originating in small countries but small countries are affected by

large countries' domestic disturbances. In this paper, we generalize
some of the results and present the structure of the model in more
detail.

Using a four-country, two-tier macroeconomic model, it is shown that

the pseudo-exchange rate union of the two small countries with the large
partner has no effect on their real exchange rates but affects their
price levels, whereas a full monetary union requires in principle a

transfer from the large partner in the anion. The allocation of this
transfer between the two small countries by their common central bank
will have real effects when the allocation rule differs from the
steady-state monetary distribution.

Introduction

In connection with the celebrated controversy about the relative
desirability of fixed and flexible exchange rates, a considerable analyt-

ic literature on monetary unions has emerged. It was surveyed ten years
ago by Tower and Willet (1976). Since then, there have been contributions by Allen and Kenen (1980), Aoki (1983a and b), Marston (1984a and
1985), Melitz (1984), Huizinga (1984) and others.

According to this literature, the key factors on which the impact of
a union depends are, first, the sources and types of economic disturbances giving rise to exchange rate fluctuations, second, the trade patterns
of the country joining the union, and, third, wage and price behavior at

home and abroad. The conditions under which a fixed exchange rate regime
is superior to floating according to some social welfare criterion
usually involve a complicated weighting of these key factors, making
generalizations difficult.

The relative size of the partners is generally reflected in the

source and types of disturbances as well as in the trade pattern. In our
analysis of the West African Monetary Union, Macedo (1985a), though, size

is the major structural characteristic of a country. Specifically, large
countries are not affected by disturbances originating in small countries
but small countries are affected by large countries's domestic distur-

bances. In this paper, we generalize some of the results and present the
structure of the model in more detail.

It relies on standard aggregate demand and aggregate supply relationships, with trade and capital movements linking national economies.
Account is taken of the unequal size of the potential partners by

-4-

modelling

two pairs of identical economies, large and small. These are

two identical large economies whose bilateral exchange rate floats freely
and two identical small economies who decide on whether they will float

or fix their exchange rate with one of the large countries. In so doing,
they also allow the union-wide central bank to decide on monetary
allocations.

Due to the difference in size between the partners in the union,
only the distribution of money between the two small countries is

endogenously determined. Even there, it can be modified by the alloca-

tion of a monetary transfer from the large partner. In the terminology
of Corden (1972), there is a pseudo-exchange rate union between one of
the large countries and the small countries but full monetary integration
between the two small countries.

Each national economy is highly stylized, and the focus of the model
is on the interaction of the members of the monetary union, two small
countries labelled country one and country two, who take as given the
member of the pseudo-exchange rate union, labelled country star and the

country outside the union, labelled country double-star. The model is
recursive because the small-country tier is irrelevant to the

large-country tier. The results can therefore be extended to three or
more tiers.

The national economies are described by conventional aggregate

relationships. Demand for domestic output (the IS curve) is a function
of foreign outputs, relative prices or the real exchange rate, and the
real interest rate and it can also be changed by an exogenous demand

disturbance. Demand for real balances (the LN curve) is a function of
domestic output and the nominal interest rate, as a measure of the return

-5-

differential.

By eliminating the nominal interest rate, we obtain an

aggregate demand curve which relates domestic output to the real exchange
rate, to foreign output and to the exogenous demand and monetary distur-

bances. A real depreciation increases the demand for domestic output
along conventional foreign trade multiplier lines.
The supply of domestic output is derived from labor market equilibrium, where the supply of labor by workers responds to the wage deflated
by a consumer price index and the demand for labor by firms responds to

the wage deflated by price of the domestic good. Eliminating the nominal
wage, we obtain an aggregate supply curve relating domestic output to the
real exchange rate and an exogenous supply disturbance, which can be

interpreted as an increase in productivity. A real depreciation lowers
the supply of domestic output because it raises the product wage. Prices
change as a proportion of the difference between demand for and supply of

domestic output, so that a Phillips curve allowing for real wage rigidity
is featured.

The model is closed by the assumption that domestic and foreign
assets are perfect substitutes, so that interest rates are equalized in

the steady-state. This determines recursively the real exchange rate and
the price of domestic output, in terms of the exogenous real and monetary

disturbances respectively. Then, under flexible exchange rates, the
nominal exchange rate is given by monetary disturbances, whereas, under
fixed rates, the nominal money stock is determined endogenously.
Size does not affect the interest-rate elasticities of money demand
and aggregate demand, which are common to all four countries, and the
other parameters are identical between the pairs of large and small

countries. These assumptions are not essential for the results, but an

-6-

analytical- solution does require some symmetry between economic
structures.

The model is used to assess the effect of fixing the bilateral
exchange rates of the two small countries with one of the large coun-

tries. Under price flexibility, the exchange rate regime has no effect
on the real exchange rate, since the effect on the nominal exchange rate

and the price level offset each other. Nevertheless, a monetary union
between one of the large countries and the two small countries may
require a transfer from the large partner, which offsets internal and

external disturbances. To that extent, the union allows the small
countries' central bank to enforce an asymmetric monetary allocation

rule. Then prices will not be adjusted to the nominal exchange rate and
the real exchange rate will also have to change as a consequence of the
price rigidity.

We write here the model with variables expressed as logarithmic
deviations from the stationary state, leaving the derivation and inter-

pretation of the parameters to Appendix 1. We also set to zero the rate
of change in prices and exchange rates. This can be interpreted as the
stationary state of a model with perfect foresight on these variables.
The dynamic version of the model is solved in Appendix 2, where its

stability is also discussed. Finally, we present the large country tier
in terms of average sums and differences of variables and exogenous

disturbances, as done by Aoki (1981). The more conventional presentation
can also be seen in Appendix 2. Thus, a variable x., j = 1, 2 will be
expressed as

II. Flexible Exchange Rates

The log-linear model consists of the equations listed in Table 1.

The variables and parameters are defined in Table 2. We solve the large
country tier first.

Equations (5)-(1O) in Table 1 show that monetary disturbances have
no effect on the real exchange rate, whereas they have one-to-one effects

on the price level, as can be seen from equation (11). Indeed, the real
exchange rate is given by a composite real disturbance which involves the
difference between relative demand and supply shocks in the two large

countries. The supply disturbance enters with a multiplier effect, given
by V:

While relative real disturbances are channeled through the real
exchange rate, global real disturbances are channeled through the real (

Note the dampened effect of a global supply disturbance on the
interest rate, in contrast with the magnified effect of a relative supply

disturbance on the real exchange rate. A positive supply shock in the
starred country raises output and therefore requires a depreciated real
exchange rate and (if v <

1) a lower interest rate to raise domestic and

foreign demand for the starred country's output. A proportional increase
in the relative demand for and supply of output in both countries (suA =
*ud) still depreciates the real exchange rate by v/N but now raises the
interest rate by v/b.

Given (16), we obtain y* and y** from (8) and (9). Given (17) and
real outputs, we get their price from (11). Finally, we obtain the
nominal exchange rate from the definition of the real exchange rate and

the solution for the prices of domestic output. It is useful to write
those in terms of composite disturbances:

11±1+i*..*s

(18)

where

du

a
d
'u +*u

Note that y* =

+ *u5 and y**

..1 +

u5,

so that we get the LN

curve immediately. Also, the effect of a global supply shock is magnified on the price level because, aside from the interest rate effect,
given by (1 -

v)c/b,

there is a distinct one-to-one effect. In (18) this

effect is made up of a global part (*u) and a relative part (*u). The
latter is included in the composite relative real disturbance 1i, which

enters negatively for p* and positively for p**. If the multiplier term
included in N were zero, this would become a weighted average of demand

and supply disturbances. The demand disturbance is weighted by the
supply elasticity (ku/N) and the supply disturbance is weighted by the

-11-

demand elásticity (a/N). Therefore if output is demand-determined (k =

0) and there are no supply shocks (u =

0),

this composite disturbance

vanishes. If, in addition, there are no global shocks (*u =

0),

the

interest rate effect also vanishes and prices are proportional to mone-

tary expansion. Of course, the interest rate effect always cancels in
the expression for relative prices:

p*p**=2*u1_2

(19)

Let us now consider the effect of the disturbances in turn. Monetary disturbances have no effect on the real exchange rate and offsetting
one-to-one effects on the nominal exchange rate and on the own price

level as can be seen from (18). Negativelycorrelated real disturbances

(such that *u =
(i* =

= 0).

u* and *u = 0,

i = A, it) leave interest rates unchanged

The effect on the price level is given by the first term

in (18). For example, relative demand expansion in country star appreciates the real exchange rate by 1/N, raises the home price level by ku/N,
lowers the foreign price level by the same amount and leads to a nominal

appreciation of 2k/N. Unless the supply elasticity is very small,
therefore, there will be a magnification of the effect on the real

exchange rate. Note that when k =

u = 0,

j =

*,

the price level is

independent of real disturbances, and the real money stock u - p3 is
fixed.

Positively correlated real disturbances (such that *u =

= 0, i = A, it, m) leave exchange rates unchanged (0* =

e

= 0).

u'

and
The

effect on the price level is given by the second term in (18). The
effect of a demand shock differs from the effect of a supply shock by a
factor of 1 - V + b/c.

-12-

Comirig to the small countries' model, the interest rate is still
given by (17) but the real exchange rate now reflects two factors in
addition to the relative real disturbances featured in (16) for the real

exchange rate of the two large countries. These are the choice of the
numeraire and the nature of the trade patterns between the domestic

economy and the two large countries. We write the solution as:

(20)

and

u' =

u.

-

*u

i =

A,

The first term measures the relative sensitivity of the domestic
economy.to the two large countries in terms of the demand elasticities
(a* and a**) and the share of foreign goods in the consumer price index

(a and a). We will return to it below. The second terni (in square
brackets) captures the effect of trade patterns. If the trade multipliers with the two large countries are the same (v*

v**), relative real

disturbances there have no effect. Global supply disturbances in the two
large countries still have an effect, however, as long as the small
country trade multiplier (2v*) differs from the large countries trade

multiplier (v). Thus, If v/2 >

v*,

a favorable supply disturbance in the

large countries will lead to a real depreciation in the small countries

and conversely. When trade patterns are strongly symmetric (v/2

v**),

v* =

this term drops out. The effect of relative real disturbances

featured in (16) above is captured by the third term in (20), where the
cyclical position of the domestic economy is measured relative to the

-13-

world average. For example, if domestic demand increases by more (UA >
the real exchange rate depreciates.

The real effective exchange rate of the small country can be defined
as a weighted average using the shares in the consumer price index as
weights:

(e*+p*p)+(1 -) (e**+p**_p)

(21)

=
where

=

0*

0 -

a/(1 -

a)

Using (21) in (20) we get

Eo.![A*o*+uvd+d)

(22)

where

A* =

(a*a.

-

a**a*)J(l

-

ci)

Note that the choice of the nuineraire continues to play a role

unless the trade elasticities are proportional to the weights in the

consumer price index, i.e. unless =

or

=

0.

This case, emphasized

by Marston (1984a) in the context of his model, may be called the case of

"balanced sensitivities". It is a useful benchmark, but (22) shows
clearly that the real exchange rate between the two large countries will

have a positive effect on the small countries' real effective exchange
rate is trade with the partner country is relatively more sensitive than
reflected on the share of partner countries' goods in the consumer price

index. Conversely, if the share is large relative to the trade elasticities, a real depreciation of the starred countries' currency will imply a
real appreciation of the small country's currency.

-14-

Another way to look at this effect is in terms of "optimal weights".
Then (20) shows that the weighted sum of demand and supply elasticities

with each trading partner, , should be used to offset the effect of the
choice of the numeraire. With these weights, and in the absence of
asymmetries between the two partners (U" =

0),

the real effective

exchange rate is solely a function of the cyclical position of the small
country relative to the rest of the world.

The price of domestic output is again obtained from the supply
equation, (10) in Table 1, and money-market equilibrium, equation (11) in

Table 1. Leaving the separate effect of the interest rate as given from
(17) above and using (20), we get:

(23)

= h(1

The weighted average of domestic demand and supply disturbances

(relative to foreign global disturbances), denoted by I,

is

now a proper

one since, for the small open economy, we neglect the multiplier effect
with repercussion present in 1i.

Using (18), the difference between the domestic price and the price
in the double starred country can be written as:

—15—

Addirig (20)

and (24), we obtain the nominal exchange rate with the

numeraire. Using triangular arbitrage, we obtain the exchange rate with
the starred country. These can be written respectively as:

(26)

Note that the direction of the effect of supply shocks depends on

demand elasticities. If a* +

a**

<

1, then

> 1

and the effect will be

negative on the composite disturbance ud.

As mentioned, when sensitivities are balanced (A* =

0),

the real

effective exchange rate of the domestic country is given by a c-weighted

average. The same is of course true for the nominal effective exchange
rate. In general, using (19), we can write the nominal effective exchange rate and the effective relative price ratio respectively as:

(27)

E*+(A.Ok+UV) - (l_2)1_Ud

(28)

Ep=um_*u+X(A*O*+UV)_(1_2)_1d

When trade patterns are strongly symmetric, U" = 0 and A*

0 and in

the expressions simplify considerably. In particular,

U5 and the effective exchange rate in (27) becomes:

-16-

= ud -

(29)

ud u -

as before.

To sum up the results of the three-country model under flexible
exchange rates, we see that, with complete syimnetry, disturbances enter

as differences between the domestic and average foreign value, which we

have denoted as u, i = A,

it,

m.

This is due to the neglect of foreign

repercussions for the small open economy. Monetary disturbances have
one-to-one effects on nominal variables and zero effects on real vari-

ables. Real disturbances have less than one-to-one effects on the price
level (the smaller the lower the supply elasticity relative to the demand
elasticity, as captured by x) but the effect on the real exchange rate

depends on the size of both, as captured by H. The effect of demand
disturbances on the nominal exchange rate will be more than one-to-one if
elasticities are low (,

> 1),

in which case a favorable supply shock will

involve a depreciation.

III. Two-tier Monetary Unions

A two-countiy union

1.

If the domestic economy enters into an exchange-rate union with the
starred country so that e* = 0 (taking an initial value of unity), then
e** =

e.

In this case, the foreign model determines the exchange rate

and the prices of foreign outputs but the domestic money stock adjusts to
keep real money balances at the level required by domestic and foreign
real disturbances.

The irrelevance of the exchange rate union for real variables
reflects the classical dichotomy between the real and monetary sides of

-17-

the economy. Either a small country lets the exchange rate float and
determines its money stock or it fixes the exchange rate, and the money

stock becomes endogenous. We can thus write:

(30)'

where

and

e_e**=_p=m_u
is the price level under the union
m is the (endogenous) money stock under the union.

According to (30), if the fixed exchange rate e is lower than the
one prevailing before the agreement, the money stock and the price of
domestic output will fall by the same amount (relative to their previous

values) under flexible exchange rates. The fall in the money stock is
brought about by a capital outflow which would increase in magnitude if
the government attempted to increase the supply of domestic assets to the

public. As long as real output does not change, the real money stock
remains fixed and the fall in money balances is transmited to prices.
Only by increasing demand for real output could the government enforce a

different nominal income. Alternatively, as we will see, the loss in
reserves could be offset by a transfer from abroad.

To obtain the small country's money stock under the union, set the
left-hand-side of (26) equal to zero and solve for m:

(31)

mu*+ (1- C)O*_ (A*e*+U") _1i+ud
Substituting for 0* so as to show the nominal exchange rate, we get:

(32)

m =

+ (1 -

)e - (A*0*

+

U") + (1

-

2)

÷

-18-

This is nothing but the definition of the nominal effective exchange

rate in (27) solved for the money stock. In fact, we can write the
simplified equilibrium condition in (29) in this regime as:

(33)

s E".'
m="u+
e+Ud

where

E = (1

-

C)e, the effective exchange rate under the union.

The two countries which have formed the exchange-rate union have to
agree on how to defend their common parity with the double-starred

country. The union-wide money stock is still exogenous and, together
with the money stock of the double-starred country, it determines the

flexible exchange rate between the two large countries. Any exogenous
increase in the union-wide money stock is endogenously allocated between
the two partners on the basis of their steady-state shares:

+

(34)

(1

-

q*)m* =

t*

where

t* is an exogenous increase in the union-wide money stock

and

rj* is the share of the small country's money stock.

The domestic economy being small relative to its partner means we
can make q* =

exogenous, m*

2.

0, so that the money stock of the starred country is still
=

U.

A monetary union of two small countries

Suppose now that there are two, rather than one, small countries
which peg their exchange rates to one of the large countries and pooi

—19—

their res&rves together. We assume that the total money stock of these
two countries --

is

which we now refer to as the union-wide money stock --

small relative to the money stock of the large country. Since the two

small countries are of similar size, however, we need to track the money

between them. In that case, the mechanisms of monetary allocation within
the exchange rate union may have real effects in the two small countries.
We still neglect the trade multiplier as well as the role of relative prices in determining the pattern of trade between the two small

countries. Links are exclusively monetary.
Like (34), a monetary union between the two small countries involves

an allocation of their money stocks. Unlike then, though, the two
countries are of similar size and both money stocks are endogenous:

(35)

rni1+(1-q)m2=t

where

t is an exogenous increase in the union-wide money stock.

and

fl is the share of country one's money stock.

Since the two small countries fix their bilateral exchange rate, we

can equate their effective exchange rates so that, making Ee = Ee

U' = q U1 + (1 - q)U2

and

Given the unchanged real exchange rates, equations (36) through (38)
are the solution of the exchange-rate union between two small countries.
If t

0, the money stocks are unchanged when demand and supply distur-

bances are perfectly correlated (U1 =

U2).

In that case, from (38), the

effective exchange rate appreciates by U = U1.
Clearly, when the two countries are identical in steady state and q
=

we can express the solutions in terms of differences and sums of the

relative domestic disturbances. In particular U = (U

U - *U5

+ U

)/2, so that

is simply a -weighted average of the difference in global

disturbances in small and large countries.

3. A three-country exchange-rate union

The effect of fixing the exchange rate with country star can now be

seen from (38). In that case, the effective exchange rate is fixed by
the monetary arrangement and some other variable has to adjust. Solving
(38) for the required increase in the small-countries union money stock,

denoted by , we get:

(39)

=Ufl_*U+(l_)e*_i+u

The first equation in (39) shows the nominal effective exchange rate

-21-

under the union, whereas the second substitutes for the floating exchange
rate to express the determinants of the required transfer by the large
partner.

The difference in small countries composite global disturbances IJJ

(weighted by q) and the large countries is captured by the first two

terms in (39). For example, the effect of demand expansion is positive

and given by {[q u + (1

-

q) u} -

(u + ur)/2}.

The supply effect

hinges again on whether

disturbances in the large countries. The effect of relative demand

expansion in the partner (*u > 0) is negative and given by (1 -

k)/N whereas
if a > (1 +

the supply effect is ambiguous. It will also be negative

v)(1

country ( = 1).

-

),

that is if the trade is biased toward the partner

The last term captures monetary expansion in the

partner country and it has the one-to-one positive effect expected from

(31). Even if all foreign variables are at their stationary-state
values, the required transfer will be positive if there is fiscal expan-

sion in either one of the small countries. Conversely, any transfer in
these conditions will require fiscal expansion iI given by:
+ (1 -

(40)

=

ri)

where

u = 0,

and

all foreign variables are zero.

j = 1,

2

In (40), it is assumed that the transfer has no negative effect on
the money stock of country star because of the size difference (rp = 0).
Therefore, as long as the distribution of money among the small
partners is done according to (35), there is no induced change in real

-22-

variables. The situation changes with the establishment of a common
central bank or in the presence of a nominal rigidity.

Taking the latter point first, if the price of domestic output is
fixed, changes in the real exchange rate are transmitted to the nominal

exchange rate, which must be flexible. When both the nominal exchange
rate and the price of domestic output are fixed, then, the government

must use fiscal policy to offset the effects of real disturbances. In
particular, if the domestic country pegs its exchange rate and prices do

not adjust, the real exchange rate will have to change accordingly. The
monetary union has a real effect due to the combination of the price

rigidity and the change in monetary regime. If, at a price given by p
the real exchange rate is 0 and the price does not change after joining
the union, the difference in real exchange rates equals the difference in
nominal rates, so that, from (30), dropping j subscripts, we get:

(41)

oT_o=_pT
The difference between the price prevailing in the neutral situation

and the rigid situation can be decomposed further into the difference in

real outputs and in money stocks. The latter, in turn, can derive from
an increase in the foreign money stock. Assuming that 8 = 0 under the
"neutral" union (i.e. UA =

u,

we get:

A demnd expansion u, perhaps in the form of fiscal expansion,

appreciates the real exchange rate by 1/H, whereas a monetary transfer
from abroad has a one-to-one effect.

When account is taken of the induced real appreciation, the demand
expansion increases output by x <

1.

Given monetary policy, this expan-

sion would reduce prices by the same amount it expands output, so that
the nominal appreciation would be given by x

1/H =

. Ruling

out the

exchange rate change and the fall in prices requires an increase in the

money stock by the same factor , which will be less than one if the
trade elasticities are high enough. The real appreciation is accompanied

by a rise in prices in the amount 1/H. To keep the nominal exchange rate
constant, demand expansion must therefore be consistent with the increase
in the money stock or UA =

Of the equivalent rise in nominal

income, a proportion xI goes to real output expansion and the remainder
(1 -

goes to the rise in prices and fall in the real exchange rate.
In sum, the effects of a fixed exchange rate regime are confined to

nominal variables unless there is a price rigidity, an induced demand for
domestic output, as a consequence of fiscal expansion, or a transfer from

abroad. The latter possibility becomes quite relevant when there is a
common central bank for involving the two small countries.

4. A monetary allocation rule

Consider now that the required transfer is allocated by the union's
central bank based on an administrative rule given by:

(43)

-24-

where

is the money stock of country one under the ui-rule.

Under this rule, the money stock of country two becomes:

1-w
21_

(44)

Contrasting (43) with (36), it is clear that these two money stocks
will not be the same, so that prices will also differ in the two situa-

tions. Given that the nominal exchange rate is tied by the monetary
arrangement, the real exchange rates and hence real outputs will also be

different. Denoting the real exchange rate of country one under the
T
ui-rule for the transfer by 81, we have:

T

Several features of (47) and (48) deserve notice. If q = w, the gap
in the real exchange rates is entirely determined by the relative cyclical positions of the two small countries, weighted by their monetary

shares in stationary state. If those are equal (q =

The effect of foreign disturbances can be easily analyzed. It is
also possible to combine the monetary rule with a price rigidity.

V. Conclusion

The implications of the two-tier model described in this paper
roughly confirm the importance of the factors traditionally mentioned in

the literature in monetary unions. Their impact hinges on the type of
disturbance shocking the macroeconomic equilibrium, the trade pattern of

the various countries and wage and price behavior. Except for the
special Keynesian case mentioned at the end of Appendix 1, no emphasis

was placed here on the latter factor. The impact of the other two,
particularly of the first, was extensively analyzed.
We now list the major results, mentioning the relevant parameters

for ease of reference. We begin with the dynamic stability of the large
countries block, discussed in Appendix 2. The condition for the two
economies to reach the stationary state under perfect foresight, given
initial conditions, are that the share of domestic goods in consumption

be greater than the share of foreign goods ( <

and that there be some

sluggishness in price adjustment. The latter requirement ensures
saddle-point stability under perfect foresight insofar as it

-26-

compensate the instability of price and exchange-rate expectations
(whose strength is c and b respectively) by a trade-off between price

inflation and the output gap (whose slope is y). The condition is yc < 1.
Looking at the long-run solution of the model, the real and nominal
exchange rate between the two large countries (0* and e respectively) as
well as the price level (p**, the price of the numeraire currency country

was chosen) in one of them are simultaneously determined. They are
expressed in terms of relative demand supply, and monetary disturbances

in both countries. Thus, if the disturbances are perfectly correlated

(u =

ur = uA etc.), the nominal and real exchange rates remain at. their

long-run equilibrium values and the price level increases (less than

proportionately) with demand expansion and decreases (more than proportionately) with a productivity improvement.
The same result holds for the difference between the price level of
the small domestic economy under flexible exchange rates and under the

monetary union. For example, demand expansion will be more inflationary
under flexible exchange rates if foreign demand disturbances are perfectly correlated and conversely.

The effect of domestic real disturbances is always more inflationary
under the monetary union when the trade-elasticities are large (the

composite domestic disturbance term is a weighted average when

<

1).

The model of the pseudo-exchange rate union relies on the automatic
adjustment of the balance of payments of the partner to solve for the

real exchange rate or the price level of the partner countries. The
money stock of the domestic economy becomes an endogenous rather than a

policy variable. This is the classic counterpart to making the exchange

-27-

rate between the partners a policy variable, which is precisely fixed by
monetary partners intervention.

In a full monetary union, however, the monetary allocation between

member states becomes endogenous. In that case, the union may change the
real exchange rate of the countries tied by the monetary rule. If
steady-state shares are given by q, then the rule is denoted by the share

of money, w/q allocated to country one. Then monetary expansion in the
large country in the pseudo-exchange rate union (u* >

0) will increase

the real exchange rate gap (and thus depreciate the real rate of the
domestic economy) if the monetary allocation rule is less than the
"natural distribution't given by w =

r.

If w >

q, on the other hand, the

real rate of country one will depreciate and the real rate of country two

will appreciate. When the natural distribution is maintained, demand
expansion in the two large countries has no effect on the real rate gap
in the two small countries.

The focus of the analysis was on the allocation of a given transfer
between the two small countries, because -- as shown in Macedo (1985a) —-

this

is an important feature in the recent experience of the West African

Monetary Union. Nevertheless, the transfer mechanism is likely to be
present whenever small countries peg their exchange rates with large

ones. By emphasizing the size difference, the model presented in this
paper was able to handle a 3-country exchange rate union with a central

bank between two of its members. An analysis of the strategic interaction between the members of the union is a natural application of this
set-up.

APPENDIX

I

DERIVATION OF A LOG LINEAR MODEL

This appendix derives the log-linear model used in the text for one

small country. It can easily be adapted to the large countries. The
supply side is an extension of the three-country model in Marston (1984a)

which introduces domestic supply disturbances and an endogenous labour

supply. The wage contract set-up is left out. Supply disturbances are
featured in the two-country model of Marston (1984b). The demand side is
adapted from Macedo (1983).

1. Supply

Consider a Cobb-Douglas technology for domestic output, subject to a

random productivity disturbance. For a given stock of capital, set to
one by choice of units, we have

(1)

Y =

where

Y is domestic output

L is employment
is a supply disturbance

A is the share of labor (a constant)

By marginal productivity pricing, we have:

-29-

(2)
where

W is the wage rate
P is the price of domestic output

Substituting for Y in (2), we get labor demand as a function of the
real product wage and the disturbance term:

Ld =

(3)

We

assume that the supply of is a function of the wage measured in

terms of the consumer price index, defined as a geometric average of the
domestic currency prices of the goods produced in the three countries:

(P*E*)' (PkE**)a

(4)

c =

where

P*(P**) is the foreign currency price the good produced in the
partner (non-partner) country;

E*(E) is the price of the partner's (non-partner's) currency
in units of domestic currency;
and

The price of the partner's currency in terms of the non-partner's is
determined by triangular arbitrage:
(5)

E =

E**/E*

Using the definition of the two relevant real exchange rates, we

have another expression for P:

-30-

(6)

=

(1 -

=

P**E/P*

-Pc

where

and

0 =

P**E**/P

According to (6), proportional changes in pC and P require that the
real exchange rate efffects offset each other or 0* = 0(1
If the

'.

domestic real exchange rate depreciates, the real exchange rate of the

partner will have to depreciate by a smaller amount. The larger the bias
in trade toward the partner, measured by c&,../(l -

a),

the smaller this

dampening effect.

We are now in a position to express labor supply as a positive
function of the real wage, with elasticity n:

(7)

LS = N

(W,pc)n

Using (6) in (7) we get

(8)

LS = N

[(w/P)e*e1 - a)1n

In equilibrium, demand for labor equals supply of labor except for a

frictional unemployment pool. Equating (8) to (3), we obtain the equilibrium product wage as a function of the terms of trade. Denoting
logarithmic deviations by lower case letters we get:

(9)

[1+n(1-X)](w -

p)

=

-n(1-X)[a0*

-

(1-a)0]

÷

-31-

Using(2) to substitute for L in (1), we get aggregate supply as a
function of the product wage, which, upon substitution from (9), yields:

h=l+(lx)

Demand

which defines aggregate demand:

M'(Y, E1Pi)

X1 (H1) are exports (imports) to (from) country i, i =

UA is a demand disturbance

In (11) the trade balance is expressed in units of the domestic good
and the effects of foreign (domestic) income on exports (imports) are to
be interpreted in common units, not made explicit to avoid cluttering.
To linearize (11), log differentiate, denote again logarithmic deviations
by lower case letters and define r

The two large countries

The large countries model, whose stationary-state version is solved
in the text, consists of the following set of equations, where variables
are defined as logarithmic deviations from their steady-state level and

The model includes five differential equations, respectively the
two IS curves, the two price adjustment rules and interest parity. The
state of the system is described by the real and nominal exchange rates

and the price of the output of the double-starred country, O, e and p**
respectively. To reduce the system to three differential equations, we
first eliminate the interest rates by using (9) to eliminate the real
rates and then using (3) and (4) to eliminate the nominal rates:

_be*_bp*+(1+)y*_v*_ae*+p*=u +(1+b)u*
(12)

be*bp**+

(1÷)y*_vy*+ae*+p**ur+(l+)u*

Using (3) and (4) again to substitute for nominal interest rates in
(7), we get:
(13)

c=y*_y**+p*_p**_u+u*
Using the difference of the two equations in (5) and (6) to elimi-

nate the difference in outputs from (10), we have:
(14)

_i*+(!_c)(1+2k)8*_e_u*+u**+u* _u**
Similarly, we use (5) and (6) to eliminate outputs from (12). For

the starred country we get:

(15)

_b*- [(i÷) -b]

[a+(1++v)k]*+p*

uFinally, we eliminate p* and p using the definition of the real
exchange rate in (8). The system can then be written as:

To write (16) more compactly, we define matrices and vectors as
follows:

(17)

x* =

p** e)'

We now solve the homogeneous system, in order to ascertain its
dynamic properties. Inverting J.,. in (17), and multiplying its inverse by

minus D*, we obtain the system in the form:

-36-

= A*X*

(18)

A. =

where

=
Since a12 =
a32

0 in A, the characteristic equation only involves

seven of the nine coefficients and can be written as:

(19)

where

a1 =

a2 —

a3 = 2Ny3

and

X is an eigenvalue of A,...

We therefore have the solutions:

A =

-a1

(20)

2Aa2±J a+4a3
The signs of a1 and a2 are ambiguous. They basically depend on

whether yc
that

1. A preference for domestic goods is usually assumed, so

(the "transfer condition"). Not surprisingly, a crucial

parameter is the speed of price adjustment. Recalling that c would be

interest rate (say 15%), then yc <

sum

of

v

1, a low speed of adjustment, implies

(v is given by the marginal propensity to import divided by the

the marginal propensities to import and not to spend). This means

not only that a1 > 0 so that we have one negative eigenvalue, but also

that the other two roots alternate in sign because a3 is unambiguously
positive. Therefore, when prices adjust slowly, the system has two
directions of stability and one direction of instability, given by the

nominal exchange rate. When prices adjust fast, on the other hand, the
real exchange rate also has a positive eigenvalue and the system has two

directions of instability, associated with the two jump variables. In
the limiting case where prices adjust infinitely fast to excess demand

for goods (y - co), all three state variables are forward looking. Then
dynamics come solely from expectations and we have:

Performing the same operation as before, we obtain the eigenvalues of the

-38-

The fact that

=

is

a reflection of the recursive nature of the

new system, evident from the structure of J,.. The important point,
though, is that the three eigenvalues are positive unless the "transfer
<

condition"

does not hold, in which case

< 0. Note that this

condition was not crucial in the previous analysis because of the irrelevance of the sign of a2.

The structure of the two large economies simplifies considerably
when the price of their domestic output is assumed to be fixed at some
identical level (y = 0 and p* =

p**

=

u*).

This reduces the model in

(16) to one differential equation in the nominal (and real) exchange

rate. Since the remaining aggregate demand and supply equations cannot
be solved uniquely for outputs in the two countries, we concentrate on
the case where output is demand-determined so that we do not use (5) and

(6). The case where output is supply-determined could be handled by
neglecting (1) and (2).

The neglect of supply side effects makes the model in (1)-(11) a
conventional Keynesian model with perfect foresight and (16) reduces to:

Consider now that aggregate demand and monetary policy in the large
countries fluctuate according to:

(23)

j =

where

i

= A, m

Then the non-homogenous system (22) and (23) will have one positive
root associated with the jump variable e and one negative root associated
with the composite forcing variable describing the relative cyclical

position of the two countries. The equilibrium solution where e = 0 and
= 0 will be a saddlepoint. Along the stable path, we will have:

(24)

e = {2a +

c[1

Note that the size of the effect of a particular disturbance is
smaller the larger the speed of adjustment i and the preference for

domestic goods (the smaller ). The stationary solution when disturbances are permanent is obtained by making t

= 0 in (24). This special case

is worked out in Macedo (1985b).

To take a particular solution to (17) given by x* =

0,

we solve for

the stationary state of the endogenous variables, x, in terms of the
exogenous disturbances. We rewrite here in compact form the system

The model is solved differently depending on whether there is a

is a fixing of one bilateral rate, with the domestic money stock, in,

enddTgenous. We begin by solving the model for the flexible ex-

change rate case, by reducing it to two dynamic equations, one for the
real exchange rate and the other for the domestic price level since the

respective nominal exchange rate can be obtained by (31). Using a
notation consistent with (16), the two supplementary equations can be

It is clear from (34) that the system is to be solved in terms of
the foreign variables, exogenous to the domestic economy. In fact, in
obvious notation, it can be written as

(35)

J.x+Jx=D.x*+Dx+Zu*+Zu
The similarity of (36) and (17) is apparent. Note also that H is

the three-country equivalent of N. The share of the supply effect, X, is

the small country equivalent of k. It will be of use below.
We proceed to analyze the homogenous solution. We set x* (and thus
and u to zero so that we only have to compute J1D in order to solve
the characteristic equation. In this two-by-two case, it is sufficient
to compute the determinant and the trace of that matrix. The sign of the

determinant

Recalling that 4' > 0 when cy < 1, we see that, if prices do not adjust

too fast, Det < 0 and the two roots will be of opposite sign. The

negative root will be larger in absolute value if the trace is negative.
Under the same condition about y, this requires that the ratio of the
trade elasticities to the average of 4)

(the

ratio of the interest elas-

ticities), and h (the aggregate supply elasticity), weighted by a, be

small enough, or

a*+a**

38)

If cy >

1, the trace is of course positive. In fact, when y is infinite

the determinant is equal to H/abc and the system is again unstable. The
matrix J becomes then

-

j

[

a)b

-b

-c

c

Now we know from above that x* = A.L.x* when all exogenous variables

are at their steady-state levels (so that u remains at zero). We therefore rewrite (36) as

x=J1Dx+Mx*
where

M =

-J1 [JJ1D* -

D].

-44-

If the dynamics of x are sufficiently stable, then, the system in
(39) can be stable even if the homogenous system is not. But the solution for the dynamics of x* in terms of the exogenous variables would
have to be substituted for before we make some assumption about their

dynamics. For example, if each disturbance is given by (23) above, then,
for sufficiently low speeds of adjustment, a stable (or saddlepointstable) solution to the system will exist, even if y were infinite.

We now concentrate on a particular solution to (36) given by x* = x
