A Vintage Model of Supply
Applied to French Manufacturing

ABSTRACT
In Kouri, Macedo and Viscio (1982), we applied a vintage model of
supply to data from the French manufacturing sector. The model was,
however, solved with a particular parametrization (Cobb Douglas produc-

tion function and a quadratic adjustment function). Also, no fixed
factors were allowed for in the theoretical treatment, even though fixed

labor was found to be significant in the application to France. The
treatment of technological progress was equally restrictive.

Here we solve in Section I the general case of N variable factors
and N fixed factors with embodied and disembodied technological progress.
It turns out to be simpler than the combination of a Cobb-Douglas production function with a quadratic adjustment function, thus suggesting a

manageable framework for the analysis of profitability and employment in

industrial countries. The model is simulated in Section II using previously unavailable data on a subsector of French manufacturing froci 1959

to 1980. The empirical results confirm the importance of vintage
effects.

Introduction

Prior to 1973, stability in prices and expanding demand masked the
difference among production techniques and the way in which these differ-

ences were related to economic performance. Following the energy price
shock, though, a period of sharp inflation and prolonged recession
clearly highlighted the importance of vintage differences.

A key element of the vintage approach is the time path of invest-

ment. Firms construct plants with long useful lives when measured on an
engineering basis but only those plants which can operate profitably will

be used. Unexpected increases in factor prices can lead to economic
obsolescence if existing efficiencies of inputs such as labor and energy

cease to be appropriate at the new prices. Plant closings are the final
recognition of this obsolescence. The severity of the plant closings in
the 1970's can be explained in this manner.

Reported utilization rates in many industries are currently over-

stating the present level of unused capacity. The issue is not just
measuring excess capacity, but identifying usable capacity. Thus, in
many industrial countries, the smokestack industries have been plagued

with idle capacity. Nevertheless, investment is required to maintain
usable capacity. The profitability of an investment can be seen most
easily in countries not. burdened with old technology that lowers the

average rate of return. Both Korea and Japan have been very successful
competing in world markets by applying modern, efficient production
techniques in

smokestack

industries.

The steel industry provides a good example of the importance of

vintage differences: between 1974 and 1978, eighteen percent of the

blast fucnaces in
iii

a

ton

the

United States have been scrapped. Producing steel

blast furnace requires over twenty-six million btu's of energy per
of output, almost three times more than the mini mills which use

electric arc furnaces and continuous casting. The intermediate input
requirement is also different because electric arc furnaces use scrap

steel as a feed stock while blast furnaces are traditional smelters. The
advantage of the newer mini mills goes beyond energy and materials and

translates into a large difference in profitability. Capital costs for a
blast furnace process are about $2000 per ton per year of capacity,
almost seven times higher than the corresponding figure for a mini mill.

Although asset size is not an exact representation of the production
process, it is indicative of the profitability of the newer technology:
in 1982 US steel firms with less than $25 million assets had a profit of
$30 million while firms over $25 million registered losses of over $800
million.

Electric utilities in the US provide another example of how vintage

cost curves affect production. The first, and unexpected, decline in
electricity demand took place in 1982. There is a long lead time for
planning and construction of new generating capacity, so that new plants
are continuing to come on stream despite the slower growth of demand in

the past few years. The distribution of plant utilization clearly showed
the expensive plants--in this case oil-fired generators--are

underutilized while coal-fired plants are still being built. One New
England utility ran an oil-fired plant at two percent capacity, using it

for peak-loading only. Currently, about ten percent of the oil-fired
capacity

on the

East Coast is planned to be converted to coal.

Past

fuel

choice is a major determinant of current operating costs and these costs
determine utilization rates.
Other industries are heavily investing ira predominantly cost savings

rather than in increasing output capacity. Almost all recent investment
in the US paper and pulp industry has been to reduce labor and energy

costs. Very little new capacity has been created. Current capacity
utilization rates reported for this industry are over 98 percent. Partly
as a result of this shift in investment, the profitability of the industry has completely turned around from its trough.

The performance of industry has shown that adjustment of production

techniques to changing condition is slow. Improved efficiency is made at
the margin, as new facilities are built. Old capacity can be a hindrance
to new investment. International competition favors those newly industrializing countries where the most appropriate technology can be de-

ployed. Since the most profitable plants will be utilized more
intensively, the decline of profitability in the industrialized West and
newly emerging patterns of international trade can also be explained by

difference in vintage characteristics. Indeed, foreign direct investment
is attracted to countries and sectors with a low rate of return on old

capital but a high rate of return on new capital. Strategic considerations relating to trade policy notwithstanding, substantial Japanese
investment in the US auto industry in recent years can be explained along

these lines. The implication is that the traditional measures of return
to capital which equates the productivity of old and new capital may be
seriously misleading in the prediction of international capital flows.

Even though the international repercussions of vintage differences
are an important issue for future research, it can be agreed that, in the

words of Fabbri (1984) foreign penetration forces "a portion of business'

net investment to be siphoned into 'slenderizing' existing plant."
This view, which has been used in recent analytical work by
Nalinvaud (1983), also underlies the model of Faini and Schiantarelli

(1984), tested using data for the Italian industrial sector. Earlier
contributions to this way of thinking can be found in Kouri, Macedo and
Viscio (1982), where a vintage model of supply is applied to the French

manufacturing sector. The model is, however, solved with a particular
parametrization and no fixed factors were allowed for in the theoretical
treatment, even though fixed labor was found to be significant in the

application to France. The treatment of technological progress is also
restrictive.

We now solve the general case of N variable factors and N fixed
factors with embodied and disembodied technological progress in Section I
and simulate the model using previously unavailable data on a subsector

of French manufacturing from 1959 to 1980 in Section II. While many of
the considerations mentioned above are not yet fully reflected in the
model presented here, they do provide a motivation for the approach.
Moreover, they are intended to outline a research agenda.

I The Model

Think of an industry as a collection of plants, characterized by
their capacity, unit input requirements, and flexibility (ratio of fixed

to variable costs). These characteristics are chosen at the time of
construction, and they cannot be changed ex post. Plant characteristics
do, however,

vary over the life

span of the plant because of deprecia—

tion, learning by doing, and disembodied technological progress.

Time is divided into discrete production periods, during which the
stock of

capital remains fixed. The

flow

of capital services during the

period is the product of the stock of capital at the beginning of the
period and the time of its active use, or the rate of utilization. The
level of employment is similarly fixed during the production period,
while labor input can vary.

Once a plant has been constructed, there are two levels of choice:
firstly, whether or not the plant should be operated, shut down temporarily, or permanently scrapped; and secondly, if it is operated, what the

rate of utilization of capacity should be. We assume that there is a
maximum capacity ex post, and that output increases at a diminishing rate

as that maximum is approached. The actual rate of utilization is determined by short run profit maximization.
We assume that the capacity of the plant, and the technology coefficients, are chosen at the time of construction so as to maximize the
present discounted value of profits over the lifetime of the plant.

Factor prices as well as the price of output are exogenously given to the

firm. Total investment is also given exogenously in each period, and the
decision is on how it is allocated between capacity creation, labor

saving, energy saving, and so forth. This decision determines dynamic
supply and factor demand schedules, which are functions of the time path
of investment, and of output prices and factor costs, both actual and

expected at the time of construction, We sketch in the conclusion a
procedure to make investment endogenous.
In general, there is no simple production function representation of
the supply side, nor can the economy be described in terms of a represen-

tative plant. Plants of different vintage differ because of changes in

- () -

prices

and costs, and because of embodied technological progress. The

model is able to characterize these differences in a manageable way, and
also capable of assessing their quantitative significance.

The model is first derived for the case of N variable factors and

compared to the standard putty-putty model. Fixed factors are introduced
next.

To reduce the number of the parameters, we assume that the productivity of a given plant is a function of time (disembodied technological

progress), year of construction (embodied technological progress), and

F({a.},1) is a standard neoclassical production function, with

A useful benchmark is provided by the case where y. and a can be

chosen every production period: technology is putty-putty. Then, substituting from equations (1) and (2) into (4) we express output as: ;

Substituting (5) in (3) and maximizing profits, we find that the
rate of utilization should be chosen every period so as to maximize

output. This optimally chosen rate of utilization,

which can be

called the normal rate, satisfies:

Then (6) implies that the optimal rate of capacity utilization is
constant and given by equation (21) in Kouri, Macedo and Viscio (1982),
reproduced below:

(9)

u. =
1

2oirO u.

Except for the Cobb-Douglas case, u. is a function of the capital
intensity of production and therefore of factor prices and technology
coefficients.

In the putty-putty case, the plant is always operated at the normal

rate. We can therefore solve u5 out of equation (5) to obtain a
conventional production function:

(10)

G({q

I.)

Thus the concepts of capacity and capacity utilization play no role

in a putty-putty model of production. Equation (10) shows that there is
no maximum capacity. Output can always be increased by employing more
labor. Similarly, there is no role for expected future factor prices.
In contrast, with putty-clay technology, expectations about the
future become important in determining the optimal choice of technology

since decisions made at the time of construction cannot be revised. We
denote by a and y. the technology coefficients chosen in period i for
a plant of vintage i. The expected time path of the product wage is

denoted by fw} and that of the productivity coefficients by
and {qj. Given expectations, the firm chooses a and y.

The maximization problem in (11) is subject to the technology

constaint given by (4). The choice variables are a? and y.. In
addition, the optimal solution implies optimal planned rates of utiliza-

tion, denoted by

for each period. These are conditional on

expectations prevailing in period i. The utilization rate must obviously
be non-negative: this is an additional constraint of the maximization
problem.

The optimal plan must satisfy the following first-order conditions:

In general, the functions denoted by

have no closed

form representation. Using the parametrization in (7) a.nd (8) above with
labor and energy as variable factors, Kouri, Macedo and ViscIo (1982)

present an explicit solution for the case of static expectations as well
as for the case where there are no expected changes in relative factor

prices. Macedo (1983) presents an explicit solution for the case where
relative factor prices are expected to vary.

Once the plant has been constructed, the only flexibility is the

choice of the rate of utilization. For a plant of vintage i the actual

rate of utilization in period t, u1 is determined by:

Comparing equations (17) and (12), it is seen that the actual rate
of utilization is equal to the planned cx ante rate of utilization,

u.k, only if expectations concerning

and cl turn out to

be correct. Indeed, the only difference is that (17) is expressed in
terms of realized productivitIes and input costs rather than in terms of
their expected values (denoted by a tilde over the variable).

It is convenient to write the rate of utilization as a function of
the ratio of technology coefficients and effective unit input costs:

a and

2. Fixed Factors and Economic Obsolescence

When all costs, apart from sunk capital costs, are variable, there
is never any reason for plants to be shut down since it does not cost

anything to keep them alive. The situation changes when it is costly to
keep a plant alive. To integrate this feature into the model, denote the
N fixed factors by Z3 and their prices by w3. The associated

productivity

—J
coefficients are denoted by a3 and qa

By their very

nature, fixed input requirements do not change over the lifetime of the

plant. They are proportional to initial investment:

(21)

The rest of the model remain.s basically unchanged, but now the firm
has one more choice with respect to a plant already built (with given y.,

and a). The choices are: (a) to produce, (b) not to produce but
still keep the plant alive; and (c) to shut the plant down.
If the plant continues to produce, the rate of utilization is chosen
so as to maximize X.

Total output is then simply the Sum of outputs of all active plants.

The total demands for variable inputs are the sums of input requirements

of all active plants. Finally, the total demands for variable inputs are
the sums of fixed input requirements of all plants that are alive.

The problem of technology choice at the time of construction also
changes when there are fixed factors. Technology is now defined by:

III. Simulation Results for France

The model presented in the previous section has been simulated for

the French intermediate goods manufacturing sector (branch U04). The
purpose of this exercise is to study the behavior of the mode1 and to

17-

measure its ability to replicate the

historical

evolution of output arid

factor demands in a particular subsector of French manufacturing.

The basic series are reported in the Data Appendix. The data on
output, materials and energy consumption are expressed in billions of

1970 francs, series (1) through (3) in the Appendix. The series for
labor was obtained as follows. First, by multiplying employment by
average hours worked in the subsector and the number of weeks in one
year, we obtain series (4) in the Appendix, expressed in billions of

man-hours per year. We then use total labor compensation in the
subsector (wages, employees' social security contributions and fringe

benefits) for the base year 1970 and divide it by the man-hours series to

obtain the wage rate in the year. The adjustment coefficient comes out
to 10.37 francs per man-hour.
In the simulation, a number of assumptions need to be made. concern-

ing expectations about productivity and factor prices in units of output.

These are listed in Table 1. As mentioned by Nairesse and Dormont
(1985), at this level of disaggregation nominal prices of factors in

manufacturing probably introduce a bias in the results. In part as a
consequence, they are inclined to neglect their importance. These
difficulties notwithstanding, we interpret our results as supporting a

view where both expected and actual factor prices play a crucial role, as
emphasized in Macedo (1985).

The prices of output, materials and energy are reported in the Data

Appendix, series (6) through 8, while series (9) therein reports the

wage in units of output. By multiplying this series by series (6), it is
easy to see that labor comuensation increases by more than energy,

reaching 400 in 1980 from the base 100 in 1970. This implies a growth

expectations assumption of Table 1 for the period 1974-1980.

Aggregate values for output, employment, energy consumption, and

intermediate goods consumption g.enerated by the model (denoted by S)
are obtained by summing across vintages in each year. These values
differ from historical data (denoted by A.) by a scale parameter f3..
The model's simulated values are then regressed against actual values, as
a four-equation system, after allowing for first-order autocorrelation in
the error term:

coefficient of autocorrelation is particularly high in the energy equa-

tion, where the standard error is also highest. The employment equation,
on the other hand, shows no autocorrelation.

From the simulated values thus obtained, a dynamic simulation

(denoted by DS±) is run using 1959 actual values as a base and
adjusting the values as:

output and factor demands. Note that the fitted output series is off in

the first year but it follows the actual series consistently. The graph
of intermediate inputs is not shown because it replicates almost exactly

one for output: series (6) and (7) in the Data Appendix show how

close

prices ere during the sample period. This implies that working

with value-added is a good approximation, as argued in Kouri, Flacedo and
Viscio (1982, note 12).

The putty-clay aspect of the model can be seen in the changes in the

technology parameters in Table 3. The evolution of a and by shows that,
when factor prices are increasing, firms will economize by increasing the

efficiency of that factor. In response to a 50% increase in wages, the
labor-capital ratio declined by about 20% from 1970 to 1980. Note that
the unit

requirement

for intermediate materials increases over this

period. The increase in materials cost combined with embodied technological progress (which decreases wage costs) accounts for the relative
stability in the coefficient of output, y.

Both utilization and profits (operating surplus) decline over time

in each vintage, see table 4. From 1959 to 1980, for example, the profit
of that vintage falls to one-half of its initial value, while utilization

falls to one-fourth. The decline in profitability due to age of a
vintage is caused by two factors: the physical depreciation of the
initial investment which reduces output, but not fixed costs; and factors

costs rising above expectation, which lowers utilization rates. This is
clear after 1974, where utilization in 1980 is lower than for the 1973
vintage, and the profit rate is higher.

Neasures of profitability are reported in Table 5. The return on
sales (or rate of profit) and the return on assets. The latter is
computed as aggregate operating surplus divided by aggregate capital
stock.

A downward drift in rates

of return is evident. The decline is

due to costs increasing faster than revenues. The lower initial

utilization

places the firm on a lower portion of the marginal cost

curve, but profitability is still not fully recovered. Note that the
profit of a 1980 vintage is 23%, whereas the average rate is only 18%.

The shift in labor demand can be seen in Chart 4 where the demand

for labor in 1973 and in 1980 is aggregated across vintages. Both demand
curves are almost coincident despite the larger capacity in 1980.

However, recall from table 3 that the coefficient of labor has been

declining considerably since 1973. The shift in the demand for labor can
also be seen by comparing employment of 36 billion francs (at the base
wage of unit in 1970) for a real wage of 120 in 1973 and 32 billion
francs for a real wage of 160 in 198Q (see Appendix Table 1).

The shift in output supply curves reported in Chart 5 shows less

elasticity in 1973 than in 1979. Noreover, despite greater capacity,
higher cost shifted the supply curve sharply to the left between the two

years. From a supply of 172 billion francs at a price of 110 in 1973, we
go to a supply of 200 billion francs at a price of 220 in 1979 (see
Appendix Table 2).

Conclusion

The vintage model of supply is able to address issues of profitabiliLy and factor demands from the perspective of profit maximization of the

firm. Despite the uncertainty as to the appropriate values for expectations and technological progress, the model was able to roughly capture

the behavior of a subsector of manufacturing in France. This may be an
indication that severe measurement problems need not obscure the relevance of factor prices in explaining the decline of employment and
profitability in French manufacturing during the seventies.

We

have argued in this paper that the differentiation between old

and new capital by profitability is essential in assessing the "surplus'

capacity in many of the industrialized countries. The premature obsolescence of old capital by rising factor costs has both hindered the

productive capacity and improved the profit potential for new investment

relative to the average rate of return across vintages. Moreover, higher
factor costs require a propor-tionately greater amount of gross invest-

to yield an equivalent output capacity as cost savings investment
increases.

ment

The results are, nevertheless, quite tentative and oniy purport to
illustrate the workings of the model. Aside from a more satisfactory
treatment of demand, along the lines of Malinvaud (1983) for example.,

further work remains to be done in parametrizing individual countries and
industries.

In

addition, the question of whether a plant should be built in the

first place must be answered. We merely sketch the argument here.
Associated with each investment program inherited from the past, there is
an investment plan for the future which, given the price of investment

goods, determines the expected supply curves. By netting out the investment cost from the gross value of the firm, one obtains a sequence of

expected net values of the firm. The rule is then to increase investment
until the ratio of net value to its replacement cost (marginal q) is

greater than one. This in turn determines investment and depreciation in
each period.
