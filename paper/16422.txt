The Impact of Education on Health Knowledge

ABSTRACT
The theory on the demand for health suggests that schooling causes health because schooling increases
the efficiency of health production. Alternatively, the allocative efficiency hypothesis argues that
schooling alters the input mix chosen to produce health. This suggests that the more educated have
more knowledge about the health production function and they have more health knowledge. This
paper uses data from the 1997 and 2002 waves of the NLSY97 to conduct an investigation of the allocative
efficiency hypothesis by analyzing whether education improves health knowledge. The survey design
allows us to observe the increase in health knowledge of young adults after their level of schooling
is increased by differential and plausibly exogenous amounts. Using nine different questions measuring
health knowledge, we find weak evidence that an increase in education generates an improvement
in health knowledge for those who ultimately attend college. For those with high school as the terminal
degree, no relationship is found between education and health knowledge. These results imply that
the allocative efficiency hypothesis may not be the primary reason for why schooling impacts health
outcomes.

Introduction
The seminal work of Grossman (1972a, 1972b) created the theoretical framework of a

human capital model for the demand for health, where health is both demanded and also
produced. The model posits that the stock of health capital enters the utility function as a
consumption good because better health increases utility. Health capital also determines the
amount of time that can be devoted to work in the market, and to the production of nonmarket
goods. Health capital depreciates over time, and gross investment in health can be produced by
a household production function that uses the person’s own time and such health inputs as
medical care, diet, and cigarette and alcohol consumption.
The pure investment version of the Grossman model, where health does not provide
direct utility, generates unambiguous predictions. For example, as long as the marginal product
of health capital declines as the stock of health gets larger (which is reasonable because output
produced by health capital has a finite upper limit, such as 8,800 hours per year) schooling
should increase the quantity of health demanded (for the details of Grossman model, see
Grossman 2000). In Grossman’s model schooling causes health because schooling increases the
efficiency of health production. Numerous studies provided evidence for the causal impact of
schooling on health (Chou, Liu, Grossman and Joyce 2010, Conti, Heckman and Urzua 2010,
Lleras-Muney 2005, Currie and Moretti 2003, Berger and Leigh 1989).1 However, it has also
been suggested that schooling influences health mainly through its impact on allocative
efficiency. In this hypothesis, schooling alters the input mix chosen to produce health.
Specifically, it is presumed that the more educated choose a combination of inputs that produces

1

more output than does the input mix chosen by the less educated (see Rosenzweig and Schultz
1982 and papers discussed in Grossman 2006).
A horse race between allocative efficiency and productive efficiency can be conducted by
estimating health production functions which include education and all potential health inputs.
Because it is difficult to measure all health inputs (i.e. health behavior) and also because health
inputs themselves are functions of education, estimation of such production functions is plagued
with empirical difficulties. An indirect method to determine the relative importance of allocative
versus productive efficiency involves estimating the relationship between schooling and health
inputs by controlling for the impact of health knowledge (Kenkel, 1991). If schooling improves
allocative efficiency by increasing health knowledge and thereby altering the choice of health
inputs, schooling should have little or no direct effect on health inputs in a model that controls
for health knowledge. However, Kenkel (1991) finds that even though part of the impact of
schooling on smoking and drinking alcohol is attributable to health knowledge, most of the
impact of schooling on these (negative) health inputs remains even after controlling for health
knowledge, suggesting that allocative efficiency is not a major factor. Price and Simon (2009)
find that during the three-month period after the publication of an article in the New England
Journal of Medicine about the risk of a vaginal birth after having a previous C-section birth
(VBAC), the incidence of VBAC dropped more significantly among the more educated mothers.
This finding suggests that more educated people absorb new information more quickly, which
may then change their behavior. Similarly, Aizer and Stroud (2010) report that more educated
mothers reduced their smoking after the release of the 1964 Surgeon General Report on smoking
and health while the less-educated did not. These findings support the allocative efficiency

2

hypothesis because they imply that education increases information about the true impact of the
inputs on health.
Allocative efficiency hypothesis suggests that more educated individuals have more
information about the structure of the production function. As explained by Grossman (2008),
this implies that “...the more educated have more knowledge about the harmful effects of
smoking or about what constitutes an appropriate diet.” In this paper we conduct a direct
investigation of the allocative efficiency hypothesis by analyzing the relationship between
schooling and health knowledge. Using data from the 1997 and 2002 waves of the National
Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 cohort (NLSY97) we investigate whether education
improves health knowledge. It is plausible that more educated individuals have more health
knowledge not because of education itself, but because of other attributes that allow them to
acquire health knowledge and that these attributes are correlated with education. For example,
if wealthier and knowledgeable parents transmit their health knowledge to their children at home
and if children of such parents obtain more education, then the impact of the home environment
may be attributed to education if home environment is not adequately controlled for. In
empirical analyses we are able to adjust for the impact of household characteristics.
Furthermore, the survey design allows us to observe the increase in the health knowledge of
young adults after their level of schooling is increased at differential and plausibly exogenous
amounts. Specifically, two observationally identical young adults who have the same level of
education in the first wave (1997 wave) of the survey may have completed different levels of
schooling in the second wave (2002 wave) because the surveys are administrated in different
time periods. More specifically, the 1997 wave of the NLSY97 was administrated between
January 1997 and May 1998, and the 2002 survey was administered between November 2002

3

and July 2003. This means, for example, that a 9th grader in the 1997 wave could have been
interviewed 54 months later in the 2002 wave of the survey, while another 9th grader could have
been interviewed 78 months after the first survey. Given that the timing of the surveys is not
correlated with student or parent attributes, this design implies that the second student was
exposed to 20 additional months of schooling in comparison to the first student.2
Using school attendance between the two surveys in Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
regressions and using the distance between surveys as an instrument for attendance in
Instrumental Variables (IV) regressions, we find spotty evidence for the hypothesis that an
increase in the level of education generates an improvement in health knowledge among those
who ultimately attend college. The effect is even weaker for males. In the sample of individuals
where high school is the terminal degree, there is no discernible impact of education on health
knowledge. These results imply that the allocative efficiency hypothesis may not be the primary
reason for why schooling impacts health outcomes.
Section II describes the empirical specification. Section III presents the data. Section IV
discusses the results and Section V is the conclusion.

II.

Empirical Specification
Consider Equation (1) below, where Kit stands for the extent of the health knowledge of

the person i at time t, approximated by the probability of answering correctly various questions
about health production and disease prevention.
(1)

Kit=α + β Sit + XitΩ’ + εit ,

2

The difference in exposure to schooling in this example is 20 months rather than 24 because there is no
schooling in Summer months. We provide evidence for the exogeneity of the timing of the survey to
observable household attributes in the data section.

4

where Sit stands for the schooling level of the individual i at time t, and Xit stands for a vector of
variables that are expected to influence the health knowledge of the person. There is no
reasonable reverse causality in this specification because the extent of an individual’s health
knowledge should have no impact on his/her level of schooling. On the other hand, the
estimated impact of schooling on health knowledge, represented by β, could be biased if the
empirical analysis fails to control for such factors as family income and parent education that
may influence both the level of schooling of the person and his/her health knowledge.
Furthermore, it could also be the case that unobservable personal and family characteristics,
which are part of the error term εit, may be correlated with schooling Sit. If εit consists of two
components, πit and μi, where πit is idiosyncratic white noise but Cov(Sit, μi) ≠ 0, the estimate of
β will be biased.
We exploit the fact that the NLSY97 respondents answered the same health knowledge
questions both in the 1997 and 2002 waves. This allows us to investigate the link between the
change in education and the change in health knowledge between these two waves. Taking the
time-difference of Equation (1) between the two survey years differences out the person-specific,
time-invariant component μi, which generates
Δk Kit= β Δk Sit + Δk Xit Ω’ + Δk πit ,

(2)

where Δk stands for k-month difference. In Equation (2), current health knowledge is a function
of the change in the quantity of schooling over the last k months, as well as the change in
observable family attributes such as family income and household size. We estimate regressions
based on Equation (2).
It is easy to show that under a distributed-lag representation, Equation (2) can be rewritten as

5

(3)

Kit= β Δk Sit + Δk Xit Ω’ + γ Kit-k +eit ,

where eit is the error term, which is uncorrelated with schooling. As an alternative specification,
we also estimate versions of Equation (3).
Note that, as explained in the previous section, not each person is observed in exactly 5year intervals. In fact, the average time between the first and second interview is 68 months (the
shortest distance between the two interviews is 54 months, and the longest distance is 76
months). Therefore, the k-th difference in Equation (3) stands for different lengths for different
people. The distribution of the number of months between the two interviews is displayed in
Figure 1. The variation in the distance between the two interview dates translates into variation
in schooling respondents received between the first and second interviews. The average number
of months of school attendance between the surveys (Attendance) is 50.3
In principle, a higher value of Attendance captures both the effect of schooling and the
effect of aging. Thus, age at the second interview can be added as a control variable to isolate
the impact of schooling. However, a variety of analyses, described in the Section on
Instrumental Variables demonstrate that aging, in the range that exists in this data set, has no
direct impact on health knowledge, or on other types of knowledge that are plausibly acquired in
school. Moreover, age was never significant in any regression estimated, and inclusion of age
did not alter other coefficients (reported in Appendix 2). Therefore, we do not control for age in
the regressions. As explained below, this allows us to estimate the models also using

3

The number of months in school is smaller than the number of months between the interview dates
because the former does not include those months where the school is not in session, whereas the latter
does. However, in a handful of cases the number of months in school is greater than the number of
months between the interview dates because in these cases the corresponding students had dual
enrollments (e.g. simultaneous enrollment in high school and college), and we counted enrollment in each
month in each type of institution towards total school attendance.

6

instrumental variables, where school attendance is instrumented by the distance between
interviews.
The correlation between household income (household size) in 1997 and the length of
time in months between the two survey waves is -0.01 (0.02). This confirms that distance
between the two surveys is exogenous to household attributes. Given that school attendance
between the two survey years is directly related to the time passed between these two survey
years, much of the variation in Attendance is due to the variation in time between interviews.
However, part of the variation in Attendance is due to college attendance. For example, school
attendance will differ between two students who have the same distance between the interviews
if one of them has a terminal high school degree, but the second one decided to go to college. To
isolate the impact of attendance, we followed the students until the survey year 2007 to identify
those who eventually went to college.4 Thus, we created a sample that consists of students who
attended college at some point in their lives until they were 24 years of age on average (in year
2007).5 We name this sample “College-bound students”. We also created a second sample that
consists of students whose terminal degrees are high school. This sample, which is called
“Eventual High School Graduates,” includes those students who graduated from high school, but
have not attended college as of 2007.6

4

These include those respondents who were still in high school in the second survey (2002-2003), but
subsequently graduated and attended college. If schooling information was missing in 2007, we utilized
information reported in previous waves.

5

This sample is similar in design to that used by Farrell and Fuchs (1982). They selected a group of
students with at least 12 years of education at age 17, who acquired additional schooling (college
education) until the age of 24. Farrell and Fuchs (1982) analyzed the impact of additional schooling
between the ages of 17 and 24 on the propensity to smoke.

6

This includes students who were in high school during the second survey in 2002-03, graduated
subsequently, but have not enrolled in college as of 2007.

III.

Data

The main data set is constructed using information from the 1997 and 2002 waves of the
National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 cohort (NLSY97). The NLSY97 contains a
nationally representative sample of 8,984 youths who were aged 12 to 16 as of December 31st
1996. The respondents have been followed annually since the survey was initiated. In the first
year of the survey, biological and/or residential parents of the respondents were interviewed to
provide supplemental information about their education and their knowledge of health-related
issues.
Key dependent variables that gauge the extent of individuals’ health knowledge, are
based on nine questions that were asked in both the 1997 and 2002 waves to the cohort born in
1983. These questions are listed in Appendix 1. Table 1 presents the dependent variables that
are created based on these nine health questions posed to the respondents in the College-bound
sample. The descriptive statistics for the sample of Eventual High School Graduates are
presented in the Appendix 2 Table 1. The variables take the value of one if the respondent
answered the questions correctly, and zero if the answers were incorrect. For example, the
respondents were asked if they believed that smoking one or more packs of cigarettes per day
increased the risk of getting heart disease (Smoking leads to Heart Disease). Based on the
Surgeon General’s report, the correct answer to this question is yes. For each question, we
referred to authoritative sources such as the American Heart Association, Surgeon General’s
Report, National Institute on Drug Abuse and American Liver Foundation to identify the correct
answer. For the question regarding the timing of pregnancy, the correct answer is option c
(about a week after the period begins), although we also considered both options c and d as

8

correct. The latter variable is titled Pregnancy Most Likely -2.7 As Table 1 reveals, some health
questions, such as the impact of smoking on heart disease and the link between drinking and
alcohol addiction have been answered correctly by most respondents. On the other hand, the
proportion of correct answers is low for some other questions such as the link between drinking
and heart disease. The proportion of correct responses is particularly low for pregnancy related
questions.
The proportion of correct answers to the question about the relationship between drinking
and heart disease is markedly lower in the 2002 survey in comparison to the 1997 survey. It is
possible that such a decline in the rate of correct answers took place because some respondents
started drinking between the survey years, and because of cognitive dissonance they denied in
the second survey that drinking leads to heart disease. The NLSY97 contains a question about
alcohol consumption. Because the health knowledge question pertains to drinking at least five
drinks of alcohol once/twice a week, we identified individuals who consumed five or more
drinks for at least four days a month (heavy drinkers). If cognitive dissonance is a major factor,
we expect a strong correlation between the onset of heavy drinking and the propensity to change
the answers between the two survey waves. Of the 250 college-bound individuals who answered
correctly in the first wave but incorrectly in the second wave, 218 were not heavy drinkers in
either wave. Only 32 were not heavy drinkers in the first wave, but became heavy drinkers in the
second wave. In a more general context, we investigated the correlation between the change in
the knowledge question and the change in heavy drinking between the survey years by running a

7

We did not use the question that asks whether smoking one or more packs of cigarettes per day
increases the risk of getting AIDS. This is because scientific evidence on the impact of smoking on faster
progression to AIDS among HIV-infected individuals is mixed (Coates et al. 1990, Nieman et al. 1993).
Furthermore, the question may have been misinterpreted as the impact of smoking on the risk of HIV
infection, which is different from progressions to AIDS, conditional on HIV.

9

regression where the dependent variable is the change in the correct response indicator to the
drinking-heart disease question and the independent variables consist of three dichotomous
indicators of whether the person was not a heavy drinker in either wave of the survey, whether
he/she was a heavy drinker in the first wave but not in the second wave, and whether the person
was not a heavy drinker in the first wave but became a heavy drinker in the second wave. None
of the dummy variables were statistically different from zero. This evidence suggests that there
is no systematic correlation between the change in the drinking pattern and the propensity to
answer this particular health question correctly.
We created an index of health knowledge questions, which is the percentage of correct
answers to all nine questions.8 This index, which is listed in Table 1, may represent the overall
accuracy of health knowledge. The mean value of the index increases between the survey years,
demonstrating an improvement in overall health knowledge. The distribution of the index is
presented in Figures 2A and 2B for both waves.
Although we have no evidence that the onset of heavy drinking between the two waves of
the survey is correlated with the change in answers related to drinking, we cannot completely
rule out this possibility. It is also possible that the amount of drinking specified in the questions
is not considered as heavy drinking by the respondents, but instead it is considered as moderate
drinking. If this is the case, given the information on the health benefits of moderate drinking
(Mukamal et al. 2003; Rimm et al. 1999) it is possible that the answers are noisy. Therefore, we
also created an index of health knowledge, which excludes all drinking-related questions. This
index, titled Index of Health Knowledge-Non Alcohol, consists of the four non-alcohol related
questions: smoking and heart disease, pill and pregnancy, condom and STD, and timing of

8

We used Pregnancy most likely question as one of the nine questions.

10

pregnancy. Index of Health Knowledge-Alcohol stands for the index that consists of five alcohol
related questions.
Table 2 provides the descriptive statistics of the explanatory variables in the sample of
individuals who eventually attended college. Schooling is measured using two different
variables. Highest Grade Completed refers to the highest grade completed at the time of the
survey. This variable may contain measurement error due to the fact that some respondents are
interviewed after the end of the school year. Consider two students as an example. If the first
student was interviewed in April of 1998 (when the school was in session) and the second one
was interviewed in June of 1998 (after the semester is over), the latter student will report a value
for “highest grade completed” which is one year larger than the former, although the difference
in the amount of schooling is only two months. Such measurement error would generate
attenuation bias in the estimated coefficient of Highest grade completed. To account for the
timing of the survey, we created an indicator variable (Aftersemester) which takes the value of
one if the individual was interviewed between June 1997 and May 1998 or between June and
July 2003. Note that two students who are interviewed in different months of the same
academic year would provide the same answer to the highest grade completed questions although
the amount of schooling they have received (in months) would be different.9 This second source
of measurement error in the Highest grade completed variable cannot be controlled for.
As an alternative, and more accurate, measure of schooling we use Attendance, which is
the cumulative number of months the individual has attended any type of school (Kindergarten to
college) since the first interview in the 1997 wave.10 This variable is created by using monthly

9

An example is two students who have been interviewed in September and April of the same academic
year.

However, none of the individuals in our sample is in kindergarten or in primary school at the time of
the first interview.

11

schooling status information available in the schooling event history of each wave of the NSLY
between 1997 and 2002. Consequently, Attendance measures schooling with more precision
than Highest grade completed.
Five of the nine health knowledge questions were also posed to the parents of the
respondents in the 1997 wave. These variables are also listed in Table 2. It is interesting to note
that the percentage of correct answers is lower for parent answers.11 In some specifications, we
control for parent’s health knowledge using these variables. Race, Hispanic ethnicity and gender
indicators capture time-invariant characteristics of the respondents. They are included in Table 2
to provide information about the sample, although such characteristics will not be used in
empirical analyses as they drop out due to time-differencing.

IV.

Results
Table 3A presents the results pertaining to the College-bound students sample. The

coefficients are obtained from estimating models as depicted by Equation (2), and robust
standard errors are in parentheses. The variable ΔkSit in Equation (2) measures the change in
schooling between the two survey years. The primary measure of Sit is Attendance, which stands
for the cumulative number of months the individual attended school since the first survey.12
Thus, this variable identifies the number of months the respondent was in school between the
two survey cycles.

11

Parents were asked five questions about the health impact of alcohol. The lower rate of accuracy of
their responses to these questions may be a reflection of the fact that the parents were born in the 1950s
and 1960s and grew up during a period where society’s attitudes towards alcohol consumption were more
tolerant. It is possible that early impressions about the impact of alcohol consumption persisted over
time.
12
In the 1997 wave of the survey, when this question was asked for the first time the possible answers are
0 months or 1 month.

12

In Table 3A schooling has an impact on health knowledge for the questions about the
association between drinking and arthritis (column 4), and the questions about pregnancy listed
in columns (7) to (10). An additional month of schooling increases the probability of answering
these health questions correctly by 0.3 to 0.9 percentage points. Independent variables that
measure the change in household income, household size, whether the respondent lives with at
least one biological parent and whether the respondent lives in an urban area are not significant
determinants of health knowledge. These variables may be noisy because they are constructed,
like other independent variables, by taking the difference in relevant values between the two
survey years. Transitory changes in 1997 or 2002, which may have temporarily altered the
values of these variables from their permanent levels, would create measurement error in these
variables. Thus, as an alternative measure we used the average values of these variables between
the years 1997 and 2002. The results, which are not reported in the interest of space, were very
similar to those reported in Table 3A.
For completeness, we also report the results obtained from the model where the change in
schooling is measured by the change in Highest Grade Completed. The results, reported in
Table 3B, show that in this specification schooling has no impact on health knowledge with the
exception of the knowledge about the pill and the knowledge about the timing of pregnancy.
Each additional grade completed is associated with an increase in the probability of answering
the question on the pill (column 7) correctly by six percentage points, on the timing of pregnancy
(column 10) by about seven percentage points. A comparison of these magnitudes with those
reported in Table 3A shows that the effects associated with Highest grade completed are 7-11
times larger than those obtained from the models that employed Attendance. This is consistent
with the fact that a typical school year is about 9 months long.

13

Parents’ health knowledge may directly influence the health knowledge of their offspring
because parent health knowledge can be transmitted to the child at home. It is possible that such
transmission of knowledge from parent to the child is stronger in households where parent
supervision and parent-child contact is greater. If children from such households have better
school attendance records, then the effect of schooling will be overestimated in models that do
not control for parent health knowledge. However, as we argued earlier, because of the survey
design, the potential change in schooling between the two survey years is independent of
household attributes. Thus, controlling for parent health knowledge should not impact the
estimated schooling coefficients in our models. Tables 4A and 4B display the results of the
models where parent health knowledge is added as an additional control. This is a dichotomous
indicator which takes the value of one if the parent who was asked the health question answered
it correctly. As mentioned in the data section, only the five questions listed in Tables 4A and 4B
were posed to the parents. Therefore, we are able to estimate only five of the nine models in this
analysis.13 Table 4A uses Attendance as the measure of schooling while Table 4B employs
Highest grade completed.
The extent of parents’ health knowledge has no systematic impact on the health
knowledge of the child. Furthermore, as expected, controlling for parent health knowledge does
not change the estimated impact of schooling on own health knowledge. For example, the
coefficient of Attendance is 0.006 in the model that explains the probability of a correct answer
for the link between drinking and arthritis in Table 4A (column 3); and it is also 0.006 in Table
3A (column 4), which is the same model with the exception of parent health knowledge

13

Tables 4A and 4B employ the difference in household attributes. Using the average values of these
variables over the years that span the survey years produced almost identical results.

14

variable. The same equivalence is seen between the coefficients of Highest grade completed
reported in Tables 4B and 3B.
To present the results in a more concise fashion, we created an index where the
proportion of correct answers to all health questions is calculated for each individual. The mean
(standard deviation) of this index is 0.684 (0.133) in the first wave, and 0.749 (0.131) in the
second wave, indicating that overall, there is an increase in the accuracy of the answers between
the two survey years. The distributions are displayed in Figures 2A and 2B. The change of the
index between the survey years is plotted against the change in school attendance for college
bound students in Figure 3.14 We also created two additional health index variables: one that
consist of the five alcohol-related health questions that were also posed to the parents (Index of
Health Knowledge-Alcohol), and another one that consists of non-alcohol related health
questions (Index of Health Knowledge-Non-alcohol). Descriptive statistics of these indexes are
displayed in Table 1.
We run the models with these three health knowledge indexes as dependent variables.
The results are presented in Table 5. Column (1) displays the results where the overall health
index is the dependent variable. Columns (2) and (3) display the results where the index based
on alcohol related questions is the dependent variable. Because these particular questions were
also posed to the parents, we created the same index for the parent answers and included it as an
explanatory variable in the model reported in column (3). The results presented in column (4)
pertain to the health index with non-alcohol questions. In columns (1) to (4) schooling is
measured by Highest grade completed, and it is measured by Attendance in columns (5) to (8).
Schooling has no impact on the index based on alcohol-related health questions, and the
14

The estimated slope is 0.002 (se=0.0007), suggesting that school attendance is positively related to an
increase in the health knowledge index.

15

inclusion or exclusion of parent health information does not alter this result. On the other hand,
the index based on non-alcohol questions is influenced by schooling, and the same is true for the
overall index. An additional year of schooling increases the health index by about 1.6
percentage points, or about 2.3 percent.
We perform the same analyses using the high school graduate sample. As described
earlier, this sample consists of individuals who graduated from high school but have not attended
college until they are 24 years of age. Table 6A reports the results with Attendance as the
measure of schooling. This table is the counterpart to Table 3A. Table 6B is the counterpart to
3B where highest grade completed is the measure of schooling. In Table 6A no coefficient is
statistically significant with the exception of the smoking-heart disease question and the condom
question, and the latter has the wrong sign. In Table 6B only one education coefficient is
significant.
An interesting aspect of the results obtained from the high school graduates sample is
that there is some evidence that the hours worked in the labor market has a positive impact on
the propensity to answer some health questions correctly. This result makes sense to the extent
that working for pay creates exposure to others and provides increased opportunities for
gathering health knowledge from other individuals. The impact, however, is modest. An
additional 1,000 hours worked between the two survey years increases the propensity for a
correct answer by 2-4 percentage points.

This would roughly translate into working for about

25 hours per week for two months each summer over the last five summers.
Tables 6A and 6B show that education is not related to health knowledge in the sample of
high school graduates. In models that use Attendance, which is a more accurate measure of
education, half of the estimated education coefficients have negative signs, and with the

16

exception of smoking and condom use (where the latter has the wrong sign), they are all
statistically insignificant. It should be pointed out that the sample size is small in these
regressions, about 280 observations.
Tables 7A and 7B present the results from the models that include parent health
knowledge. As mentioned earlier, only the five questions listed in the table were posed to the
parents. As was the case with the sample of college-bound students, controlling for parent health
knowledge does not alter the estimated coefficients.
The frequency distribution of the health index for the eventual high school graduates
sample in the two surveys is plotted in Figures 4A and 4B, and Figure 5 displays the change in
the index versus the change in attendance between the two surveys. Table 8 displays the results
obtained from the models that use the health index as the dependent variable. Consistent with
previous results, the estimated coefficient of education is statistically not different from zero.
This is true for the overall health index in column (1) as well as the indexes that consist of
alcohol-related questions and non-alcohol-related questions.
To investigate the extent to which education acquired in high school has a different
impact on health knowledge than education obtained in college, we used the sample of collegebound students and employed Attendance - High School and Attendance - College as two
separate variables. These variables decompose Attendance into two components. More
specifically, in Tables 9A and 9B Attendance-High School stands for the number of months the
students attended high school between the first and second interview waves, and AttendanceCollege stands for the number of months of college attendance. As Table 9A demonstrates,
college education has an impact on the arthritis question, on the question about the pill and on
the question about the timing of pregnancy. High school attendance has a positive impact on the

17

probability of answering correctly the smoking-heart disease question, and the question on the
pill and the question on condom use. The results displayed in Table 9B show that both college
attendance and high school attendance have statistically significant impacts on the index of nonalcohol related health knowledge and on the index of overall health knowledge. The coefficient
of college attendance is larger than the coefficient of high school attendance, although the
difference is not statistically significant in most cases.
Instrumental Variables Regressions
Although aging may be correlated with an increase in health knowledge, among the
young adults who make up the data set, aging is not related to knowledge. When we ran the
models displayed in Tables 3A to 9B with the inclusion of age, the coefficient of age was never
significant and the other coefficients remained intact. Some of these results are reported in
Appendix 2 Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6. We regressed each health knowledge measure used in the
paper on highest grade completed, age and the other control variables separately for the 1997 and
2002 samples. In nine of the 10 regressions in each sample, the coefficient of age was
insignificant. In the case of smoking-heart attack question the coefficient was significant at the
ten-percent level, but it was negative.
As a third exercise, we regressed an indicator for whether the student’s grades were
mostly As and Bs in the 9th grade on the age of the student in months as of the end of the
academic year when he/she finished 9th grade (May). Age was not significant for either collegebound individuals or eventual high school graduates. When we used a dependent variable which
takes the value of one if the student’s grades were mostly As, the results did not change. Finally,
an indicator variable for whether the student’s grades were mostly As or Bs in the 8th grade is
included as an additional control variable in the regressions to explain whether the student’s

18

grades were mostly As or Bs in the 9th grade. The coefficients of age remained insignificant for
both college bound students and eventual high school graduates.
As a final check, we constructed a dichotomous variable that takes the value of one if the
individual gave the correct answer to the following question when asked in 2007: “Suppose you
had $100 in a savings account and the interest rate was 2 percent per year. After 5 years, how
much do you think you would have in the account if you left the money to grow: more than $102,
exactly $102, or less than $102?” In a regression of this indicator variable on highest grade
completed and age of the individual, the coefficient of age was insignificant. Excluding highest
grade completed from this regression increased the size of the coefficient of age, but did not alter
its insignificance. This body of evidence suggests that age has no direct impact on health
knowledge, school grades, or basic math knowledge.
In this section we report instrumental variables regression results where Attendance is
instrumented by the distance between the two interviews in months. As demonstrated earlier in
the paper, the distance between two interviews is exogenous. Because Attendance is the number
of months the student attended school between the two interview waves, Attendance depends on
the distance between the two waves. Distance is also correlated with the age in the second wave,
but given the evidence that aging is not related to the change in knowledge, distance is a
candidate for a good instrument for Attendance.
Tables 10 and 11 present the results for college-bound students where attendance is
instrumented by distance between interviews. As expected the first-stage has high explanatory
power with F-statistics around 82. Of the 10 health knowledge regressions reported in Table 10,
attendance is statistically significant in only one case. Table 11 shows that attendance does not

19

impact alcohol-related health index, but it has a positive effect on the overall health index, which
seems to be driven by non-alcohol-related health index.
Tables 12 and 13 present the results obtained from the instrumental variables regressions
using the sample of eventual high school graduates. Attendance is not statistically significant in
any of the health questions, and it is not significant in any of the health index regressions.

Extensions
Taking the difference in household attributes between the survey years may generate
noise if their values have been temporarily altered in 1997 and/or 2002 from the values that
would have been observed in the absence of these temporary shocks. As an alternative measure
we used the average values of these variables between the years 1997 and 2002. The results did
not change. When the models that employed attendance are re-estimated using linear and
quadratic terms of Attendance, no clear pattern emerged. Most coefficients were insignificant as
before. In some cases, the linear coefficients turned negative.
We also estimated the specification depicted by Equation (3) using OLS. Selected
regressions are displayed in Appendix 2 Tables 7-10. The results are very similar to those
obtained from Equation (2), presented in the paper. Although the proportion of correct answers
is high in some cases, estimating these models with probit generated marginal effects which were
very similar to those obtained from linear probability models. The same result is obtained when
we estimated the alternative specification displayed in Equation (3) by instrumental variables
(see Appendix 2 Tables 11-14).
To entertain the possibility that the impact of schooling on health knowledge differs
between males and females, we re-estimated the models by adding an interaction variable

20

between attendance and a dichotomous variable to indicate if the person is female. The results,
presented in Appendix 2 Tables 15 and 16, demonstrate that the impact of schooling is greater
for females, and in some of the alcohol-related questions, such as alcohol-addiction and alcoholliver damage, education has an impact on the health knowledge for females but not for males.

V.

Conclusion
There exists a large body of empirical evidence pointing to a causal effect of education

on health (Conti, Heckman and Urzua 2010, Chou, Liu, Grossman and Joyce 2010, LlerasMuney 2005). However, the exact mechanism behind the impact of education on health is less
clear. Standard theoretical models of health capital, which trace back to Grossman (1972a)
predict productive efficiency of education where an increase in schooling improves the
efficiency of health production by raising the marginal products of inputs. More schooling could
also enable people to understand better the exact nature of a health production function. Thus, in
this “allocative efficiency” approach, education improves health knowledge, which in turn
translates into a better choice of health inputs.
In this paper we perform a direct test of the allocative efficiency hypothesis where we
analyze the impact of education on health knowledge. Health knowledge is measured by the
probability of providing the correct answer to nine questions, ranging from the link between
drinking and heart disease to the most effective method to prevent a pregnancy. We use data
from the 1997 and 2002 waves of the NLSY97, and take advantage of the fact that the
respondents were asked the same health questions in both waves. Because the time difference
between the two survey years differs between participants, who were in the age range of 13 to 15

21

in the 1997 wave, participants differ in the amount of schooling they accumulated between the
two survey years.
In the sample of individuals who eventually went to college, instrumental variables
regressions reveal that education has a statistically significant impact on only one of the nine
health knowledge questions. Education has a positive impact on the index of health knowledge,
which consists of the proportion of health questions that are answered correctly. It has a positive
impact on non-alcohol related health questions, but not on the index that consists of alcoholrelated health questions. These effects are weaker for males.
The relationship between education and health knowledge is even weaker in a sample
that consists of individuals whose completed schooling is 12 years (those who graduated from
high school but have not attended college), where neither OLS nor IV regressions reveal a
significant impact of education on health knowledge. Thus, consistent with Kenkel (1991), the
results imply that allocative efficiency is not likely to be the main reason for why education
improves health.
