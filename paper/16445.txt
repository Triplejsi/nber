ABSTRACT
This study examines the influence of institutional environment on capital structure and debt maturity
choices by examining a cross-section of firms in 39 developed and developing countries. We find
that a country’s legal and tax system, the level of corruption and the preferences of capital suppliers
explain a significant portion of the variation in leverage and debt maturity ratios. Our evidence indicate
that firms in countries that are viewed as more corrupt tend to use less equity and more debt, especially
short-term debt, while firms operating within legal systems that provide better protection for financial
claimants tend to have capital structures with more equity, and relatively more long-term debt. In
addition, the existence of an explicit bankruptcy code and/or deposit insurance is associated with higher
leverage and more long-term debt. We also find that firms tend to use more debt in countries where
there is a greater tax gain from leverage, while firms in countries with larger government bond markets
have lower leverage, suggesting that government bonds tend to crowd out corporate debt. Countries
with more extensive defined benefit pension funds have higher debt ratios and longer debt maturities,
whereas those with more extensive defined contribution fund activities have lower debt ratios. In addition,
debt ratios are lower in countries that limit the bond holdings of pension funds. Finally, we do not
find a significant association between financing choices and the size of the insurance industry.

Debt Maturity Choices
Abstract
This study examines the influence of institutional environment on capital structure and
debt maturity choices by examining a cross-section of firms in 39 developed and
developing countries. We find that a country’s legal and tax system, the level of
corruption and the preferences of capital suppliers explain a significant portion of the
variation in leverage and debt maturity ratios. Our evidence indicate that firms in
countries that are viewed as more corrupt tend to use less equity and more debt,
especially short-term debt, while firms operating within legal systems that provide better
protection for financial claimants tend to have capital structures with more equity, and
relatively more long-term debt. In addition, the existence of an explicit bankruptcy code
and/or deposit insurance is associated with higher leverage and more long-term debt. We
also find that firms tend to use more debt in countries where there is a greater tax gain
from leverage, while firms in countries with larger government bond markets have lower
leverage, suggesting that government bonds tend to crowd out corporate debt. Countries
with more extensive defined benefit pension funds have higher debt ratios and longer
debt maturities, whereas those with more extensive defined contribution fund activities
have lower debt ratios. In addition, debt ratios are lower in countries that limit the bond
holdings of pension funds. Finally, we do not find a significant association between
financing choices and the size of the insurance industry.

Introduction

Corporate financing choices are determined by a combination of factors that are related to
the characteristics of the firm as well as to their institutional environment. Although most
studies focus on the importance of firm characteristics by examining corporate financing
choices within individual countries, 1 there is a growing literature that considers how
institutional differences affect these choices. To explore the cross-sectional variation in
the institutional environment, these papers examine capital structure choices across
countries (Booth, Aivazian, Demirguc-Kunt, and Maksimovic, 2001; Claessens, Djankov
and Nenova, 2001; Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic, 1996, 1998, 1999; Giannetti, 2003;
De Jong, Kabir and Nguyen, 2008).
This study builds on this recent literature in two important ways. First, because
we consider these issues within a panel that includes industry fixed effects, together with
firm-level variables, we identify the variation in capital structure across countries that
cannot be explained by cross-country differences in the industrial mix and firm-level
characteristics. Second, we consider a larger number of countries and a number of
important institutional characteristics not previously explored in this literature.
To understand our motivation, it is useful to illustrate the importance of countrylevel factors relative to industry factors in determining capital structure. A regression of
firm leverage, measured as the book value of debt over the market value of the firm, on
firm-specific variables, industry fixed effects and country fixed effects, has an adjusted
R-square of 0.19. When the regression is estimated with all variables except for country

1

Examples of empirical studies examining the association between firm characteristics and capital
structure within specific countries include Titman and Wessels (1988) – U.S., Campbell and Hamao
(1995) – Japan and Gatward and Sharpe (1996) – Australia. Barclay and Smith (1995), Stohs and Mauer
(1996) and Guedes and Opler (1996) examine the association between firm characteristics and debt
maturity in the U.S. Gatward and Sharpe (1996) undertake a similar study of debt maturity in Australia.

fixed effects, the adjusted R-square is reduced to 0.15.2 However, in a regression that
includes all variables except for industry dummies the adjusted R-square is reduced by
only half as much, to 0.17. When the full regression is estimated with debt maturity,
measured as the book value of long-term debt to the book value of total debt, as the
dependent variable, the R-square is 0.25. When the regression is estimated with all
variables except for country fixed effects, the R-square is substantially reduced to
0.09. However, in the regression that includes all variables except for industry fixed
effects, the R-square is only slightly reduced to 0.23.
These experiments indicate that the country in which the firm resides is a more
important determinant of how it is financed than is its industry affiliation, which in turn
suggests that differences in country level institutional factors are likely to have a first
order effect on capital structure choices. To examine this possibility in more detail, we
estimate a panel regression on a large sample of firms from 39 countries that examines
the extent to which cross-country differences in capital structures can be explained by
differences in tax policies; legal environment; and the importance and regulation of
financial institutions.
Our evidence suggests that the explanatory power of a model that includes
between ten and twelve institutional variables explains the cross-section of debt ratios
and maturity structures about as well as a model with 39 country dummy variables. These
regressions indicate that firms tend to use more debt in countries with a greater tax gain
from leverage, which contrasts with Booth, Aivazian, Demirguc-Kunt, and Maksimovic
(2001) who, in an earlier study of mostly developing economies, do not find a significant

This result is similar in character to a regression reported by Booth, Aivazian, Demirguc-Kunt, and
Maksimovic (2001).

relation between debt ratios and tax policy. In addition, we find that the strength of a
country’s legal system and public governance importantly affect firm capital structure.
Weaker laws and more government corruption are associated with higher corporate debt
ratios and shorter debt maturity.3 We also find that countries with deposit insurance or
explicit bankruptcy codes, like the Chapter 11 and Chapter 7 rules in the U.S., have
higher debt ratios and longer debt maturities. These findings reinforce the prior literature
on the importance of the legal system, the enforcement of investor rights and financial
distress resolution (Claessens, Djankov, Mody, 2001; Djankov, Hart, McLiesh and
Shleifer, 2008; La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny, 1997, 1998)
We also find that the preferences of the suppliers of capital influence capital
structure choices. 4 In particular, firms in countries with larger banking sectors have
shorter maturity debt, but the association between financing choices and the size of the
insurance industry is weak. In addition, firms in countries with higher levels of defined
contribution pension fund assets use relatively more equity, while firms in countries with
higher levels of defined benefit pension fund assets use relatively more long-term debt,
which could reflect differences in how these pension assets are invested. Finally, we find
that firms in countries with larger government bond markets have lower debt ratios and
shorter maturity debt, indicating that government bonds tend to crowd out long term
corporate debt.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the association between
country level institutional factors and financial choices. Section 3 introduces the set of
3

This result is consistent with Demirguc-Kunt, and Maksimovic (1999).
One should interpret these results with some caution, because an analysis of capital suppliers does raise
endogeneity concerns. In particular, we expect financial institutions to develop in ways that satisfy the
financing needs of firms. However, as discussed in Section 2.3, we have selected variables that are less
likely to be influenced by the capital structure preferences of corporations.

firm level variables that influence capital structure choice.

Section 4 describes the

sample. Section 5 presents our results and Section 6 draws some conclusions.

2. Institutional factors and cross-country determinants of capital structure
This section discusses how institutional differences between countries can potentially
affect how firms within these countries are financed. Specifically, we consider
institutional variables that reflect (1) the ability of creditors to enforce legal contracts (2)
the tax treatment of debt and equity, and (3) the importance and regulation of financial
institutions that represent major suppliers of capital.
We expect that weaker legal systems and weaker public enforcement of laws
should be associated with less external equity and shorter maturity debt contracts. We
also expect that firms in countries with lower tax preferences for debt will be less levered.
Finally, we examine whether the suppliers of capital matter. Although most of the capital
structure literature focuses on the financing preferences of firms, at the aggregate level,
firm capital structures are determined by the preferences of the suppliers of capital (i.e.
investors) as well as the preferences of firms. In particular, exogenous factors that lead
suppliers of capital to prefer to hold more or less equity relative to debt will also
influence the capital structures of firms.
The following sub-sections introduce the variables that we consider, and discuss
how these variables are likely to influence typical debt ratios within our sample of
countries.

2.1. Legal system
Incentive problems - conflicts of interest between corporate insiders (managers,
employees and/or majority shareholders) and external investors - are important factors
that shape corporate policy and productivity. As extensively explored by La Porta,
Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998), the extent to which contracts can be used
to mitigate these problems depends on the legal system, which consists of both the
content of the laws and the quality of their enforcement. In the following discussion we
will review how these legal factors influence financing choices.
In countries with weak laws and enforcement, financial instruments (e.g. short
term debt) that allow insiders less discretion, and are contractually easier to interpret, are
likely to dominate.

La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998) find

significant variation in the extent of legal protection of external investors across both
developed and developing countries, and argue that legal systems based on common law
offer outside investors (debt and equity) better protection than those based on civil law,
resulting in higher security values (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny,
2002). All else equal, this suggests that common law countries will use more outside
equity and longer-term debt. To test whether this is the case, we define an indicator
variable that takes a value of one if the country’s legal system is based on common law
and zero otherwise.
In addition to the content of the law, the integrity and enforceability of the law is
also important, which we measure by the perceived corruption level in a country.
Corruption has been identified as a key factor shaping a country’s legal system (Djankov,
La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes and Shleifer, 2003), resource allocation and firm behavior (La

5

Porta, Lopez-De-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny, 1999; Fisman, 2001; Johnson and Mitton,
2003).
We are not the first to examine the roles of legal factors in corporate financing
choices. Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic (1999) find that firms have longer duration
debt in countries where the legal system has more “integrity”. Integrity, measured by a
law and order index prepared by the International Country Risk Guide, reflects the extent
to which individuals are willing to rely on the legal system to make and implement laws,
mediate disputes and enforce contracts. In contrast, we focus on corruption, defined as
the abuse of public office for private gain, measured as the Corruption Perception Index
(Transparency International), which reflects the extent to which corruption is perceived to
exist among public officials and politicians. An advantage of this index is that it provides
both time-series and cross-sectional variation; most other measures of integrity, such as
the law and order index, do not have comparable historical data.
We reverse the index, so that in our study, it ranges from 0 to 10, with larger
values indicating more severe corruption. In the context of the firm’s capital structure
choices, the index proxies for the threat of all or part of investor rights being expropriated
by managers or public officials. Debt is expected to be used relatively more than equity
when the public sector is more corrupt, since it is easier to expropriate outside equity
holders than debt holders.

Similarly, one can argue that since short-term debt is more

difficult to expropriate, it will be used relatively more frequently than long-term debt in
more corrupt countries.
Finally, we investigate the enforcement of debt contracts. As identified by
Djankov, Hart, McLiesh and Shleifer (2008), the legal structure that specifies the

6

resolution of default differs widely across countries. Indeed, in some countries, like the
U.S., there is an explicit bankruptcy code that specifies and limits the rights and claims of
creditors that facilitates the reorganization of the ongoing business. In contrast, in other
countries with no bankruptcy codes or only weakly enforced codes, creditors often have
difficulty accessing collateral by liquidating distressed firms or seizing distressed firm
assets (Claessens, Djankov, Mody, 2001; Claessens, Djankov, and Klapper, 2003;
Claessens and Klapper, 2005; Davydenko and Franks, 2008; Dinc, 2005). With poorly
defined bankruptcy procedures, senior lenders typically possess inferior bargaining power
relative to the borrower in out-of-court renegotiations due to the weak laws and lenders’
inherent information disadvantage about the collateral relative to borrowers (Degryse and
Ongena, 2005; Petersen and Rajan, 1994) lowering demand for long-term debt. On the
borrower side, the existence of defined bankruptcy procedures for corporate
reorganization and the deferral of debt payments increase the incentive for firms to issue
long term debt since a default can be less onerous.5 We conjecture that the lack of explicit
bankruptcy codes and enforcement discourage the use of debt, in particular long-term
debt. Based on Djankov, Hart, McLiesh and Shleifer (2008), we define an indicator
variable that takes a value of one for those countries in which an insolvent firm can
undergo a court supervised reorganization proceeding.

2.2. Tax code
The tax system in general, and specifically the tax treatment of interest and dividend
payments, has been recognized as an important factor influencing capital structure

long-term debt was pointed out to the authors by an anonymous referee.

choices since the seminal work of Modigliani and Miller (1963).6 We observe three main
categories of tax regimes:
The first is the classical tax system in which dividend payments are taxed at both
the corporate and personal levels and interest payments are tax-deductible corporate
expenses. The classical tax system exists in Brazil, Chile, China, Hong Kong, India,
Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Netherlands, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines,
Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, United Kingdom (post 2000) 7 and the United
States.
The second is the dividend relief tax system, where dividend payments are taxed
at a reduced rate at the personal level. A dividend relief tax system exists in Austria,
Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Portugal, Sweden, Thailand and Turkey.8 In Greece and
Turkey dividend payments are not taxed at the personal level, that is, a full dividend
relief system.
Third is the dividend imputation tax system, where corporations can deduct
interest payments, but where the domestic shareholders of a corporation receive a tax
credit for the taxes paid by the corporation. The goal of the system is to tax corporate
profits only once.

Dividend imputation systems are in place in Australia, Canada,

France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Taiwan and
United Kingdom (pre 2001). The proportion of corporate tax available as a tax credit
under these imputation systems varies from country to country. In Australia, Finland,
Germany, Italy, New Zealand and Norway the full amount of the corporate tax paid is

not in our sample period.

distributed as a tax credit. In other countries only part of the corporate tax credits are
distributed.
All else equal, we expect that debt will be used less in countries with dividend
imputation or tax relief systems than in countries with classical tax systems that double
tax corporate profits. To test for this relationship for each country in our sample, we
estimate the tax shield, using the tax gain from leverage variable introduced in Miller
(1977):

1

(1   c )(1   e )
(1   i )

where  c is the statutory corporate tax rate,  i is the highest statutory personal tax rate
on interest income and  e is the highest effective personal tax rate on equity income
coming from dividends.9
The tax gain from leverage can take both positive and negative values. Negative
values arise under a dividend relief tax system, when the personal tax rate on interest
income is greater than the corporate tax rate and the personal tax rate on dividend income
is less than the corporate tax rate. This is the case under a full dividend relief system as
exists in Greece and Turkey, as well as under some partial relief countries like Belgian
and Thailand The tax gain from leverage is zero under a full dividend imputation tax
system, which is the case in Australia, Germany, Italy, New Zealand and Norway. For all
other countries the value of the tax gain from leverage is positive.

9

We also consider a dividend tax indicator variable that takes a value of one for countries with either a full
dividend relief tax system or a full dividend imputation tax system and zero otherwise.

9

2.3. Suppliers of capital

Financial economists have typically viewed the capital structure problem from the
perspective of firms that face competitive and complete financial markets, where debt
and equity capital are offered at equivalent risk-adjusted rates. However, when this is not
the case, the preferences of investors to hold debt versus equity instruments will have an
influence on how firms are financed. For example, in the Miller (1977) model, the
aggregate debt ratio in the economy is determined by aggregate investor preferences for
holding debt versus equity securities. While these preferences are determined by taxes in
Miller’s model, one can more generally consider how investor preferences for holding
various debt and equity instruments affect the capital structure choice of firms.10
We will specifically consider the preferences of banks, pension funds and
insurance companies. Banks tend to have short-term liabilities and thus may have a
comparative advantage holding short-term debt. In contrast, pension funds have longterm liabilities, and thus have a preference for holding long term assets. Likewise,
insurance companies tend to hold longer term assets. Hence, we might expect firms in
counties with a larger banking sector to use more short-term financing and firms in
countries with larger pension funds and insurance sectors to use more long-term
financing.
The analysis of supply effects raise endogeneity concerns, since we expect
financial intermediaries to develop in ways that satisfy the financing needs of firms as
well as the preferences of investors. Existing studies (for example, Dermirguc-Kunt and
Maksimovic, 1999; De Jong, Kabir and Nguyen, 2008) examine the effects of stock/bond
10

See Titman (2002) for a discussion of the effect of investor preferences on capital structure choices.

10

market size, turnover and bank total assets on capital structure choices. These variables,
however, are likely to be influenced by the capital structure preferences of corporations.
For example, in countries with industries (like high tech) that require considerable
amounts of external capital, the stock market is likely to be larger.11 With this in mind,
we depart from the existing literature and select proxies that are not likely to be directly
influenced by the capital structure preferences of corporations. In particular, we select
measures of the supply of funds available to these financial intermediaries.
To proxy for the supply of funds to banks, we use deposits/GDP to measure the
amount of funds that are available to the banking sector.12 In addition, deposit insurance
is used in many countries to protect bank depositors, in full or in part, from losses caused
by a bank's inability to pay its debts when due. This lowers the risk of bank runs,
reducing the banks need to hedge and seek more liquid short-term debt. We conjecture
that the existence of deposit insurance will influence the lending and maturity choices of
banks. In particular, banks provide more credit to firms and lend longer term debt when
deposits are protected. Hence, one might expect that firms in countries with deposit
insurance to have higher leverage and more long-term debt. To test this relationship, we
utilize a deposit insurance indicator variable that takes a value of one if bank deposits are

11

Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic (1999) recognise this endogeneity issue and address it by using a twostage instrumental variable regression. They chose as instruments measures of the size of the economy and
the flow of funds, plus proxies for the content, strength and integrity of the legal system. However, one can
argue that these variables either directly influence the capital structure choice or are potentially influenced
by the types of firms in the economy, and are thus indirectly related to the capital structure choice.
12
It is possible that there are unobserved factors that affect both the willingness of investors to deposit
funds with banks and the willingness of banks to provide long-term funding to firms, creating a spurious
relation between deposits and capital structure. For example, one can argue that the financing needs of
corporations affect the funds that are available to the different investor sectors. Suppose, for example, that
the need for monitoring declines, making bank loans somewhat less attractive to long-term bonds. On the
margin, this would increase the interest rate on long-term bonds, making it more attractive for households
to invest in fixed income mutual funds rather than bank deposits. While this creates a potential
endogeniety problem, it is mitigated by the inclusion of our institutional variables and probably has a minor
influence on our estimates.

11

at least partially explicitly insured by government and zero otherwise (Demirguc-Kunt,
Karacaovali and Laeven, 2005).
We use insurance penetration (value of total insurance premiums (life and nonlife)/GDP) to measure the amount of funds that are available to insurance companies.
Different insurance companies, however, may have very different liability structures and
may thus have different preferences for the assets that they hold. For example, life
insurance companies that offer contracts with a substantial savings component, such as
whole life contracts, might have a preference for long term debt. In contrast, insurance
companies that offer term life and property and casualty insurance tend to have shorterterm obligations, and thus, are expected to hold shorter-term debt. Unfortunately, we do
not have data that allows us to distinguish between the different sectors of the insurance
industry.
We measure pension fund penetration separately as the value of defined benefit
pension fund assets over GDP and the value of defined contribution pension fund assets
over GDP. This distinction may be important because in firms with defined benefit
plans, the asset allocation is determined by the plan sponsors, while with defined
contribution plans, the asset allocation is made by individuals. It should also be noted that
defined benefit pension plans are often underfunded, creating a liability that we do not
observe in our data set.
In addition, since it is possible that cross-country differences in pension fund
regulations influence the investment choices of pension funds, we also examine
restrictions on debt and equity holdings of pension funds. We conjecture that the relative
restrictions on debt and equity holdings will influence the choice between debt and

12

equity. In particular, pension funds will hold more equity when restrictions on bond
holdings are tighter relative to those on equity holdings. Hence, one might expect that
firms in countries with tighter restriction on bond holdings to issue more equity. To
investigate this possibility we estimate an index of relative restrictions on debt and equity
holdings measured as the ratio of the proportional limit on equity holdings over the
proportional limit on debt holdings taken from the Survey of Investment Regulation of
Pension Funds, OECD. For each year we ranked countries by their pension fund
regulation index, assigning countries into quartiles. We assigned a score of 1 to 4 to the
quartiles, with larger values indicating tighter restriction on bond holdings.
An alternative measure of the supply of funds available to financial intermediaries
is the level of domestic savings, which we measure as gross domestic saving over GDP.
In addition, we examine the size of the government bond market in each country by
including domestically denominated government bonds/GDP as an independent variable.
Government bonds can influence the supply of debt capital that is available to the
corporate market for two reasons. The first is a simple crowding out argument. If there is
a fixed supply of debt capital, then government debt can compete for that fixed supply
and leave less available for corporate borrowers. The second possibility is that the supply
is not fixed, and that the presence of government borrowers can help the debt market
develop, increasing the demand for corporate debt.

3. Firm level characteristics and capital structure choice

Consistent with the existing literature (Titman and Wessels, 1988; Guedes and
Opler, 1996; Rajan and Zingales, 1995) we include a set of firm level variables that

13

capture factors that are known to affect leverage and maturity structure. These variables
include asset tangibility (fixed assets over total assets), profitability (net income over
total assets), firm size (natural logarithm of total assets) and the market-to-book ratio
(market value of equity over book value of equity). Due to data limitations in some of
the countries included in our study, we do not include variables that measure the effective
tax rate, operating risk, research and development expenditure, capital expenditure and
selling expenses as per Titman and Wessels (1988). In place of these variables we
include the market-to-book ratio, which can proxy for growth as well as the collateral
value of assets, and industry indicator variables based on two-digit SIC codes.13

4. Data and sample

This section describes the sample and presents the country and industry patterns of
capital and debt maturity structures. It then introduces the empirical procedure employed
in this study.

4.1. Sample selection

The primary source of our firm-level data is Worldscope, which contains financial data
on companies from a wide range of industries in over 50 countries. We restrict the
sample to those firms listed on the stock market of the country in which it is domiciled.
Our analysis covers the period of 1991 through 2006. We exclude firm-year
observations with missing financial data that is required for the firm-level analysis. The
final sample consists of 36,767 firms from 39 countries, totalling 272,092 firm-years.
13

See MacKay and Phillips (2005) for evidence on the importance of industry fixed effects.

14

Table 1 provides a description of the sample, which covers a broad cross section of
developed and developing countries with every continent represented.

Most of the

countries have observations in each of the 16 years.
As can be seen from the last two columns of Table 1, the coverage of the sample
firms varies across countries in terms of number and/or market capitalization, reflecting
that Worldscope has uneven coverage of firms across the countries. For most of the
economies we have more than 60 percent of sample coverage in terms of market
capitalization and 50 percent in terms of number of listed firms. The economies with
lower data coverage tend to be developing economies.
[Table 1 about here]

4.2. Country financing patterns

Our measures of capital structure are:
(i)

leverage, measured as the proportion of total debt to market value of the firm
(total debt/market value). Total debt is defined to be the book value of shortterm and long-term interest bearing debt. Market value of the firm is defined
as the market value of common equity plus book value of preferred stock plus
total debt, or

(ii)

debt maturity, measured as the proportion of the book value of long-term debt
to total debt (long-term debt/total debt).14

To gain a basic idea about how capital and maturity structures differ across countries,
we compute the median leverage and maturity structure by country for the period 1991 to
14

Trade credit is an important source of financing in economies with underdeveloped financial institutions
(Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic, 2001; Fisman and Love, 2003). Our results are robust to including trade
credit (measured as accounts payable) in our measure of short-term debt.

15

2006. As can be seen in Figure 1, developing economies occupy both ends of the
leverage spectrum.

The highest five leverage ratios are observed in South Korea,

Indonesia, Brazil, Portugal, and Pakistan, while the lowest five are observed in Australia,
South Africa, Canada, the United States, and Turkey. Developing economies seem to
dominate the higher range, while developed economies tend to be at the lower range.
The median leverage ratio for the developing economies in the sample is 0.26,15 while for
the developed economies the median leverage ratio is 0.20. The middle range of the
leverage spectrum is mixed with both developing and developed economies.
[Figure 1 about here]
Figure 2 presents the median maturity structure by country. It is clear from the
figure that debt obligations have longer maturities in more developed economies. The
five countries with the highest long-term debt ratios are New Zealand, Norway, Sweden,
USA, and Canada. The lowest five median long-term debt ratios are observed in China,
Greece, Turkey, Taiwan, and Thailand. 16 The median long-term debt ratio for the
developing economies in the sample is 0.36, while for the developed economies the
median long-term debt ratio is 0.61.
[Figure 2 about here]
In addition to the set of firm and country-level variables described in Section 2,
we include inflation, inflation volatility (measured as the standard deviation of inflation
rates over the preceding four years) and a developed economy indicator variable that
takes a value of one if the country is classified as a developed economy according to the
15

Economies within the sample classified as developing, according to the World Bank, are Brazil, Chile,
China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and
South Africa.

This parallels the findings of Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic (1999) for an early sample period, 19801991.

World Bank classification that is based on the countries’ gross national income levels.17
Inflation is included because debt contracts are generally nominal contracts and high
inflation, which is generally associated with high uncertainty about future inflation, may
tilt lenders away from long-term debt. Likewise, higher inflation volatility reflects higher
uncertainty about future inflation, tilting lenders away from long-term debt. A developed
economy indicator variable is included because it may pick up an element of economic
development that is not already captured by our other variables. Both firm and country
level variables are lagged one period to allow for the non-contemporaneous nature of the
interaction between firm/country level characteristics and financing choices.
Table 2, which presents the summary statistics, shows cross-sectional variation in
the country-level variables.

The country-level variables are defined in Appendix 1,

along with their data sources. Except for the common law, developed economy,
bankruptcy code and deposit insurance variables that are constant across time, all
remaining variables exhibit time-series variation.18 Appendix 2 reports the country-bycountry median values of the country-level explanatory variables.
[Table 2 about here]
To gain a basic understanding of how debt ratios and maturity structures are
influenced by these variables, we compute the Pearson correlation coefficients for pairs
of the dependent and independent variables. The results, reported in Table 3, suggest that
the legal system, the tax system, and the suppliers of funds potentially influence the
capital structure choice. In particular,

The set of country level independent variables are defined in Appendix 1, along with their data sources.

In unreported analysis we examined these correlations in a number of subsamples. Specifically, we
separately examine developed and developing economies, and we divide the sample between two time
periods, 1991-1998 and 1999-2006. There are some differences between the subsamples. For example, we
find that the correlation between leverage and common law is strong only in developed economies and
taxes and deposit insurance are strongly correlated with leverage in only the initial sub-period. In addition,
the size of the government bond market is negative and highly correlated with leverage in developing
economies, but only in the initial sub-period. Deposit insurance is positively correlated with debt maturity
in only the later sub-period while insurance penetration is positively correlated with debt maturity in both
sub-periods, but only in developing economies. Finally, the size of the government bond market is negative
and strongly correlated with debt maturity in the later sub-period but only in developed economies.

18

To investigate whether these variables are likely to be subject to collinearity
problems in our later regression analysis, we examine the correlations between the
independent variables that are used in our analysis. From Table 3, we see that most
variables are not highly correlated with each other, with some notable exceptions. In
particular, the correlation between the economic development indicator variable and the
corruption index is negative 76 percent.

5. Regression analysis

This section presents regressions that estimate the influence of country-level explanatory
variables on capital structure choices controlling for firm- and industry-level
characteristics. Our regressions are estimated with a General Methods of Moments
(GMM) approach that accounts for the fact that the regression residuals are
heteroskedastic and serially correlated across both firm and country level observations.20

5.1. The determinants of leverage

Table 4 presents the results of the leverage regressions. 21 Column one reports the
regression for the full sample, column two provides evidence for the sub-sample of
developed economies only and column three the sub-sample of developing economies
only. Columns four and five provide evidence for the sub-periods, 1991-1998 and 1999-

20

The regressions are performed on panel data where the residuals may be correlated across firms and/or
across country, and OLS standard errors can be biased. We use the ordinary least square (OLS) method
with heteroscedastic / autocorrelation corrected (HAC) errors (Andrew, 1991) and clustered at the country
level (Petersen, 2008). The HAC procedure accounts for the potential heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation at the firm level by deriving the t-statistics of estimated OLS coefficients from Generalized
Methods of Moments (GMM) standard errors corrected for heteroscedasticity and auto-correlation.
21
The results are robust to the use of alternative proxies for the country’s legal system, corruption, taxation
and financial market development. Alternative proxies leave unaffected other estimated coefficients. In
addition, results are substantially unchanged when we winsorize all variables at the 1 percent level.

OECD countries for which pension fund bond/equity holding restriction information is
available. Column seven provides evidence for a select sub-sample of OECD countries
for which pension fund asset information is available.
[Table 4 about here]

5.1.1. Firm effects

The top half of Table 4 reports the coefficient estimates of our firm-specific variables.
These coefficient estimates indicate that leverage is positively related to asset tangibility
and firm size and negatively related to profitability, and the market-to-book ratio. These
results, which hold in the full sample as well as the sub-samples, are consistent with
evidence on U.S. firms (Bradley, Jarrell, and Kim, 1984; Titman and Wessels, 1988) and
more recent international evidence (Rajan and Zingales, 1995 and Booth, Aivazian,
Demirguc-Kunt, and Maksimovic, 2001; De Jong, Kabir and Nguyen, 2008). These
results are also generally consistent with individual country leverage regressions that we
report in Appendix 3. The coefficients for the market-to-book ratio have the same sign in
all country regressions. Asset tangibility and size are positively related to leverage in 38
and 34 out of 39 countries, respectively. Finally, profitability is negatively related to
leverage in 36 out of 39 countries.

5.1.2. Country effects

The lower half of Table 4 reports coefficient estimates for country variables.

The

regression for the full sample (Column 1) has an adjusted R-square of 0.1798 which is the

20

same order of magnitude as the preliminary result reported previously, regressing
leverage on firm-specific variables, industry and country fixed effects.
These coefficient estimates indicate that leverage is positively related to economic
development, but unrelated to both inflation and inflation volatility. Consistent with
better investor protection leading to a greater use of equity financing, we find that
corruption is associated with higher debt ratios, common law systems are associated with
lower debt ratios and the existence of an explicit bankruptcy code is associated with
higher debt ratios.22 In addition, we find that leverage is higher in countries where the tax
gain from leverage is positive. This evidence contrasts with Booth, Aivazian, DemirgucKunt, and Maksimovic (2001) who do not find a significant relation between debt ratios
and tax policy. This difference in results arises because of differences in both the sample
countries and sample periods. The Booth, Aivazian, Demirguc-Kunt, and Maksimovic
(2001) sample is mainly developing economies over the period 1980 to 1991. As we
show, our evidence in favor of a tax effect comes from developed economies in a later
time period.
We find some support for the idea that suppliers of capital influence firm debt
ratio choices. In particular, we find that leverage is higher in countries with deposit
insurance, suggesting that the banking industry is important, but we do not find a
significant relation between the size of the banking sector and debt ratios. In addition, we
do not find a significant relation between leverage and the size of the insurance industry,
22

We also considered the possibility that in some countries regulatory barriers to entry might decrease the
risk of incumbent firms and thereby increase their debt capacities. To examine this in more detail, we
considered regulatory variables introduced in Djankov, La Porta, Lopez de Silanes and Shleifer (2002).
However, because these variables are highly correlated with corruption and our common law indicator
variable, we did not include them in the regression reported in Table 4. The high correlation between these
entry barrier variables and common law and corruption, however, may partially explain why common law
and corruption have such a strong effect on the capital structure choice.

21

the level of domestic savings or the size of the government bond market.23 However, in a
select sample of OECD countries that report the level of pension fund assets we find that
firms in countries with larger defined benefit pension funds have higher debt ratios and
those with larger defined contribution pension funds have lower debt ratios.
There are some significant differences between the subsamples. In particular,
common law and the bankruptcy code are significant in the sample of developed
economies, but not in the sample of developing economies; while deposit insurance and
the size of the government bond market are important in developing economies, but not
in developed economies.
In addition, we find that the level of domestic savings and the size of the
government bond market are significant in the 1991-1998 sub-period, but not in the 19992006 sub-period, while taxes and deposit insurance are important in the later time period,
but not in the former period. The negative association between leverage and the size of
the government bond market in the 1991-1998 sub-period suggests that there may be a
fixed demand for fixed-income securities, so that government bonds crowd out corporate
bond issues.
The subsample analysis reveals that corruption is consistently associated with
higher debt ratios in all subsamples. However, the common versus civil law distinction is
less important in developing economies. On the other hand, deposit insurance is

23

The weak result with respect to insurance penetration may be due to the lack of a clear prediction as to
the association between leverage and insurance penetration. Recognizing that life insurance incorporates
both a savings (whole life and annuities) and an insurance (term insurance) product, we follow Beck and
Webb (2003) and the suggestion of an anonymous referee, and proxy for the size of the insurance sector as
a savings vehicle using insurance premiums/domestic savings. However, as with insurance penetration, we
do not find a significant relation between leverage and insurance premiums/domestic savings.

22

significant in the latter time period, reflecting, perhaps, an increase in the number of
countries adopting explicit deposit insurance from 23 to 33.
Taxes are significant in the sample of developed economies, but not in the sample
of developing economies, and only in the later time period. This may be due to the
observation that the influence of corporate taxes is likely to be weaker in countries where
they are easier to evade. 24 In unreported regressions, we find that taxes are significant in
a sample of below median tax evasion countries, but not in a sample of above median tax
evasion countries. 25 With this index, our entire sample of developing economies is
characterized as high tax evasion countries.
In addition, we consider an alternative tax measure that considers only the tax
treatment of dividends. As discussed in footnote 9, we estimate a dividend tax indicator
variable that takes a value of one for countries with either a full dividend relief tax system
or a full dividend imputation tax system and zero otherwise. With this measure we find
that leverage is lower in countries that tax dividends less, and this result holds strongly in
all subsamples and sub-periods.
Finally, we find that the coefficients of inflation volatility, which are insignificant
in about half the regressions, is significantly positive in the developed country subsample,
the subsample of OECD countries for which pension fund asset information is available
and in the total sample of countries in the 1999-2006 sub-period. We also find negative
associations between leverage, the size of the banking sector and the existence of deposit

24

The likelihood that the potential to avoid paying taxes influences the strength of the relationship between
taxes and leverage was pointed out to the authors by an anonymous referee

insurance in the developed economy subsample.

These latter two findings are

inconsistent with our expectations, but appear to be driven by outliers.26

5.2 Determinants of maturity structure
5.2.1 Firm effects

Table 5 reports the results of the debt maturity structure regressions.27 These regressions
are estimated on the full sample and the sub-samples as previously discussed. Column
one reports the regression for the full sample, column two provides evidence for the subsample of developed economies only and column three the sub-sample of developing
economies only. Columns four and five provide evidence for the sub-periods, 1991-1998
and 1999-2006, respectively. Column six provides evidence for sub-sample representing
OECD countries for which pension fund asset information is available.
[Table 5 about here]
The coefficients of the firm-specific variables are largely consistent with prior
research (Barclay and Smith, 1995; Stohs and Mauer, 1996; Guedes and Opler, 1996;
Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic, 1999) in the full sample and all sub-samples and subperiods. Long-term debt is used more by firms with greater asset tangibility, larger size
and higher profits. However, in contrast to the findings in the U.S., we find that the

26

In particular, the high leverage ratios of South Korean firms generate the relation between leverage and
inflation volatility, deposits and deposit insurances in both the developed economies subsample and the
1999-2006 sub-period. South Korea is characterised by high inflation volatility, a relatively small banking
sector, the existence of deposit insurance and a relatively high level of domestic savings. After dropping
South Korea, inflation volatility, the size of the banking sector and deposit insurance are all insignificantly
related to leverage.
27
The results are robust to the use of alternative proxies for the country’s legal system, corruption, taxation
and financial market development. In addition, results are substantially unchanged when we winsorize all
variables at the 1 percent level.

24

market-to-book ratio is only weakly associated with debt maturity in the full sample and
is unrelated to debt maturity in the developed economy subsample.
Appendix 4 reports the results of the country-by-country debt maturity
regressions.

The most robust cross-sectional determinant of debt maturity is asset

tangibility. With one exception, asset tangibility is significantly positively related to debt
maturity structure. On the other hand, we find cross-country variation in the signs of the
estimated coefficients for profitability, firm size and the market-to-book ratio.
Profitability is positively related to debt maturity structure in 25 (statistically significant
in 15) out of 39 countries. Firm size is is positively related to debt maturity structure in
33 (statistically significant in 21) out of 39 countries and the market-to-book ratio is
positively related to debt maturity structure in 28 out of 39 countries and is statistically
insignificant in most countries. Indeed, this relation is significantly negative only in the
U.S.28

5.2.2 Country effects

The estimates of the country level coefficients reveal that debt maturity is
negatively related to the level of corruption, but positively related to the common law
indicator variable, consistent with lower corruption and stronger investor protection
encouraging the use of long-term debt financing. Also, the existence of an explicit
bankruptcy code is associated with greater use of long-term debt. We find that debt
maturity is positively related to the level of economic development. Overall our results
28

Prior literature also report mixed results. For example, Guedes and Opler (1996) report negative relations
for U.S. firms, while Stohs and Mauer (1996) find only mixed support for an inverse relationship for U.S.
firms. Ozkan (2000) reports a positive relationship for U.K. firms. Outside the U.S. and the U.K.,
international evidence generally does not find significant relation between the two variables (Antoniou,
Guney, and Paudyal, 2006; Terra, 2005).

25

with respect to the relation between maturity structure and country level characteristics
are more robust than those reported for leverage.
Consistent with the preferences of the suppliers of capital having an influence on
the firms’ maturity structures, we find that debt maturity is strongly negatively related to
the amount of deposits in the country’s banking sector. This is in contrast to the negative,
but insignificant banking sector result reported by Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic
(1999). Further, we find that the level of domestic savings, measured as gross domestic
saving over GDP, is negatively related to debt maturity. We also find that debt maturity is
longer in countries with explicit deposit insurance reflecting the willingness of banks to
lend longer-term debt when deposits are protected. In addition, debt maturity is shorter,
the larger the government bond market. However, we find no reliable relation between
maturity structure and the degree of insurance penetration. The weak result with respect
to insurance penetration may be due to the lack of a clear prediction as to the association
between maturity and insurance penetration.29
In general, although the results in all subsamples and sub-periods are similar,
there are several exceptions. Inflation rate volatility is associated with shorter maturity in
developed economies, but unrelated to maturity in developing economies. The size of the
insurance industry is positively related to maturity in developing economies, but
unrelated to maturity in developed economies. In addition, deposit insurance is associated
with longer debt maturity only in the latter time period, possibly due to an increase in the
number of countries adopting explicit deposit insurance from 23 to 33 over the full
sample period. The size of the government bond market is negatively related to maturity
29

As noted previously, we include a proxy for the size of the insurance sector as a savings vehicle using
insurance premiums/domestic savings. However, as with insurance penetration, we do not find a significant
relation between maturity and insurance premiums/domestic savings.

26

only in developed economies and the relation is significant only in the latter time period.
In addition, for a subsample of OECD countries we find that the level of defined benefit
pension fund assets is associated with greater use of long-term debt, while the level of
defined contributions pension fund assets is unrelated to debt maturity. Finally, we find a
significant positive relation between debt maturity and inflation in the developing
economy subsample, in the earlier time period, and in the OECD subsample .30

5.3. Fixed-Effects and Cross-Sectional Estimates

This section examines the extent to which the cross-sectional and time-series variation in
our explanatory variables drive our results. Up to this point our emphasis has been on the
cross-sectional variation in capital structures. However, the debt ratios in individual
countries also vary from year to year, and some of that year to year variation may be
explained by the year to year changes in our explanatory variables.
To estimate the extent to which our results are generated from the cross section
versus the time series we estimate both firm/country fixed-effects and Fama-MacBeth
(1973) regressions. Specifically, we report fixed-effects leverage and maturity structure
regressions in columns one and two of Table 6, respectively. The Fama-MacBeth (1973)
leverage and maturity structure regressions with Newey-West corrected standard errors
are reported in columns three and four, respectively. By sweeping out individual firm
and country-effects, the fixed-effects regression estimates the extent to which the timeseries variation of our independent variables explains the time-series of capital structure
choices. In contrast, the Fama-MacBeth (1973) regression estimate the regression model
30

The result that inflation is positively related to debt maturity in both developing economies and the
earlier time period is generated by the low inflation/short-term maturity characteristic of China. After
dropping China, inflation is insignificantly related to maturity.

27

for each of the 16 years in sample period and then average the coefficients for all
independent variables across the 16 years, isolating the cross-sectional determinants of
capital structure. The coefficients and statistical significance of the independent variables
are similar to those reported in the cross-sectional, time series regressions (Tables 4 and
5).
[Table 6 about here]
The regression estimates reported in Table 6 indicate that the relationships
between financing choices and firm characteristics are significant in both the time-series
and the cross-section, and are consistent with our earlier estimates. However, the results
of the inflation and financial institution variables continue to be mixed. The results also
show that several country variables, in particular corruption and deposit insurance, have
significant effects on firm capital structure choices even though their time-serial
variations are small.

5.4 Book values and financing choices

In this section we examine how the country variables affect the levels of short-term debt,
long-term debt, and total debt relative to the asset values of the firms in our sample. We
measure book leverage as the proportion of total debt to total assets of the firm,
decomposing this measure into short-term debt to total assets and long-term debt to total
assets.
[Table 7 about here]

Table 7 presents the results of the book leverage regressions. Column one reports

28

the regression for total book leverage, column two provides evidence for the long-term
debt ratio and column three provides evidence for the short-term debt ratio. As this table
illustrates, the long-term debt ratio is higher in more developed economies, countries with
common laws, lower corruption, explicit bankruptcy codes, relatively smaller banking
sectors, deposit insurance, lower domestic savings, and smaller government bond
issuances. By contrast, the short-term debt ratio is higher in less developed economies,
countries not under common laws, countries with higher corruption, higher domestic
savings, larger banking sectors, lack of deposit insurance, and higher domestic savings.
Taken together, these results of the long- and short-term debt regressions are consistent
and complementary with the results of the debt maturity ratio regressions in Table 5.31

6. Summary and Conclusion

At the outset, we described regression results that indicate that a firm’s capital structure is
determined more by the country in which it is located than by its industry affiliation,
suggesting that the institutional environment can have a profound effect on how firms are
financed. Specifically, we find that a country’s legal and taxation system, level of
corruption and the preferences of capital suppliers – banks and pension funds – explain a
significant portion of the variation in leverage and debt maturity ratios.

31

We also find that inflation rate volatility is associated with lower total debt ratio, which is in contrast to
the previous results in Table 4, where leverage is measured as total debt to market value. Note also that the
size of the banking sector is associated with lower total debt ratio. However, this result is driven by the high
leverage ratios of South Korean firms and relatively small banking sector of the South Korean economy.
After dropping South Korea the size of the banking sector is insignificantly related to book leverage.
Interestingly, the results presented in Table 7 indicate that the relationship between financing choices and
tax is more important when leverage is defined relative to total assets rather than the market value of the
firm.

29

The effects of taxes on capital structure choices are consistent with theory. When
the tax gain from leverage is positive, firms tilt their capital structures towards more debt.
However, as we note below, the tax effect is not as strong and pervasive as other
influences on capital structure. The legal environment also has an important influence on
capital structure choices. Our strongest finding is that firms in countries that are viewed
as more corrupt tend to be more levered and use more short-term debt. We also find that
common law countries have lower leverage and use more long-term debt and that firms in
countries with an explicit bankruptcy code have higher leverage and use relatively more
long-term debt.
We also provide evidence that suppliers of capital can influence how firms are
financed. Most notably, the debt maturity structure of corporations in countries with
larger banking sectors tend to be shorter, reflecting the preferences of banks to lend shortterm. However, controlling for the size of the banking sector, firms in countries with
deposit insurance tend to have longer maturity debt, suggesting that deposit insurance in
some way facilitates long term lending by banks. In contrast, our evidence of a relation
between the size of the insurance sector and capital structure is very weak. However, we
find that firms in countries with higher levels of defined contributions pension fund assets
use relatively more equity, while firms in countries with higher levels of defined benefit
pension fund assets use relatively more long-term debt. In addition, we find evidence that
a larger government bond sector crowds out private debt capital in the developing
countries, leading firms in these countries to borrow less. We do not, however, find an
effect of government borrowing on debt/value ratios of firms in developed countries, but

30

we do find that firms in these countries tend to have shorter maturity debt when the
government bond market is larger.
While not all of our results hold across all subgroups and sub-periods, some of the
results are quite strong and pervasive. This is particularly true in the debt maturity
regressions where corruption, legal system and the size of the banking sector are very
strong in all subsamples and sub-periods. Further, the bankruptcy code and domestic
savings are also strongly related to debt maturity in all of the subsamples. Deposit
insurance, while related to debt maturity in most subsamples, is insignificant in the 19911998 sub-period.
In the leverage regressions the results depend more on subgroups and subperiods. For example, while we find that for the full sample, leverage is higher in
countries where the tax gain from leverage is positive, we do not find a significant
relation between the tax gain to leverage and debt ratios in the developing economies
subsample and the tax effect is insignificant in the 1991-1998 sub-period. Likewise, the
effect of both common law and bankruptcy code are insignificant if we restrict the sample
to developing economies. However, the relationship between financial leverage and
corruption is strong and significant in all subsamples.
Although our emphasis has been on the effect of cross-country differences in
institutions on corporate financial choices, our analysis may have implications for the
literature on how institutions can promote economic growth.32 Specifically, the fact that
institutions influence how firms are financed may provide an indirect channel through
which a country’s institutions affect economic growth. For example, there is reason to
32

Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic (1998), Levine and Zervos (1998) and Rajan and Zingales (1998) find
that, for a sample of developing and developed countries, the development of stock markets, bond markets
and banks facilitate economic growth.

31

believe that if firms can raise more of their capital with equity and long-term debt, they
will be better able to make longer-term investments, which may better promote economic
growth. This suggests that an analysis of the relation between investment horizons and
institutional structure offers an interesting avenue for future research.

Median leverage ratio of sample firms (1991-2006)
This figure plots the median leverage ratio across 39 different countries. The leverage ratio is measured as total debt over the market value of the firm. Total
debt is defined to be the book value of current and long-term interest bearing debt. Market value of the firm is defined to be the market value of common equity
plus book value of preferred stock plus total debt.

Table 2
Summary statistics
The table provides the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values of each variable. Leverage ratio is the ratio of total
debt to market value of the firm. Total debt is defined to be the book value of short-term and long-term interest bearing debt. Market value of
the firm is defined to be the market value of common equity plus book value of preferred stock plus total debt. Maturity structure ratio is the
ratio of long-term debt to total debt. Tangible assets/total assets is the ratio of fixed assets to total assets, operating risk is measured as the
absolute value of the annual change in ROA, ROA is the ratio of net income to total assets, firm size is measured as the natural logarithm of
total assets and the market-to-book ratio is the ratio of market value of equity plus book value of total debt over total assets. Country
characteristic variables are Development economy is a dummy variable equal to one when the country is classified as developed according to
the World Bank classification based on countries’ gross national income levels. Inflation rate is the annual rate of change in a country’s CPI.
Inflation rate volatility is the standard deviation of inflation rates from period t-4 to t. Corruption index is an index ranging from 0 to 10, with
larger value indicating more severe corruption. Common law is a dummy variable equal to one when a country adopts the common law
system. Bankruptcy code is a dummy variable equal to one if an insolvent firm is most likely to undergo a reorganization proceeding. Tax is
an estimate of the miller tax ratio calculated using statutory tax rates. Deposits is the ratio of a country’s bank deposits to GDP. Deposit
insurance is a dummy variable equal to one if bank deposits are insured by government. Domestic savings is the ratio of gross domestic saving
to GDP. Insurance penetration is the value of a country’s total insurance premiums to GDP. Pension fund regulation index is an index of
relative restrictions on debt and equity holdings of pension funds ranging from 1 to 4. Defined benefit pensions is the value of the country’s
defined benefit pension fund assets to GDP. Defined contribution pensions is the value of the country’s defined contribution pension fund

Table 4
Leverage, firm and country level determinants
This table presents regressions of leverage on both firm and country level variables, as defined in Table 2. All regressions include dummy variables for
industry (two digit SIC codes). The sample is divided between developed and developing economies as defined by the developed economy indicator
variable, a sample of OECD member countries for which pension fund bond/equity holding restriction information is available and a select sample of
OECD countries for which pension fund asset information is available. The sample is split into two sub-samples, 1991-1998 and 1999-2006. This table
also reports the adjusted R-squared and number of firm-year observations. Standard errors are robust to clustering within country over time. T-statistics
are given in parentheses.

Appendix 3
Pooled firm-level regressions of leverage by country
The table presents the regression of leverage on firm level variables as defined in Table 2. The regression equation is estimated for
each country using the pooled time-series and cross-sectional sample. All regressions include dummy variables for industry (two digit
SIC codes). This table also reports the adjusted R-squared and number of firm-year observations. Standard errors are robust to
clustering within firm over time. T-statistics are given in parentheses.
