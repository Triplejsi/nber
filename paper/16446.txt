Chinese Firm and Industry Reactions to Antidumping Initiations and Measures

JEL No. F1,F10
ABSTRACT
Because of large and rapid growing export volumes and its formal status as a non-market economy;
China has been the subject of large numbers of both antidumping initiations and measures. Current
estimates are that around 40% of such actions are against China; India, in turn, is the largest source
of initiation against China by number of actions. Here we explore the reactions of Chinese firms and
industries to these actions. No other papers to our knowledge explore these reactions empirically. We
use industrial panel data on all Chinese firms in the industry, foreign firms operating within China
and state owned enterprises (SOE) for aggregated firms group between 1997 and 2007. This provides
information on sales, profits, firm numbers, labor productivity, and employment. We are able to link
this data with a World Bank dataset on antidumping actions by industry by country (both by and against)
for the same period. We then use a dynamic system GMM estimator to explore the importance of different
forms of Chinese firms’ overall response to both initiations and measures. We also separately analyze
antidumping actions against China from developed and developing countries, US and EU to compare
their different effects. We find that antidumping actions by developed and developing countries negatively
impact industrial profits and employee and firm numbers and also exports. Output impacts are the
smallest. Labor productivity is improved by antidumping actions. We also find that different kinds
of firms show different responses. All firms together in an industry react to antidumping the most,
and foreign and SOE firms show a much smaller response. Also, developed countries’ antidumping
actions have more negative impact than developing countries’ actions for all firms and SOEs, but foreign
firms’ impacts are the opposite. Chinese industry reactions to antidumping actions by the US and EU
are the same as for other developed countries, but the effects of US actions are larger. US antidumping
actions have more impact than EU’s on firm numbers, employees and exports, and EU antidumping
has more influence than US on output, profit and labor productivity. Finally, comparing Chinese, foreign,
and SOE firm’s reactions to US and EU antidumping actions, our results show foreign firms to be
hurt more by antidumping from EU. We discuss policy implications in a concluding section.

Chinese Firm and Industry Reactions to Antidumping Initiations
and Measures
Abstract: Because of large and rapid growing export volumes and its formal status as a
non-market economy; China has been the subject of large numbers of both antidumping
initiations and measures. Current estimates are that around 40% of such actions are against
China; India, in turn, is the largest source of initiation against China by number of actions.
Here we explore the reactions of Chinese firms and industries to these actions. No other
papers to our knowledge explore these reactions empirically. We use industrial panel data on
all Chinese firms in the industry, foreign firms operating within China and state owned
enterprises (SOE) for aggregated firms group between 1997 and 2007. This provides
information on sales, profits, firm numbers, labor productivity, and employment. We are
able to link this data with a World Bank dataset on antidumping actions by industry by
country (both by and against) for the same period. We then use a dynamic system GMM
estimator to explore the importance of different forms of Chinese firms’ overall response to
both initiations and measures. We also separately analyze antidumping actions against
China from developed and developing countries, US and EU to compare their different
effects. We find that antidumping actions by developed and developing countries negatively
impact industrial profits and employee and firm numbers and also exports. Output impacts
are the smallest. Labor productivity is improved by antidumping actions. We also find that
different kinds of firms show different responses. All firms together in an industry react to
antidumping the most, and foreign and SOE firms show a much smaller response. Also,
developed countries’ antidumping actions have more negative impact than developing
countries’ actions for all firms and SOEs, but foreign firms’ impacts are the opposite.
Chinese industry reactions to antidumping actions by the US and EU are the same as for
other developed countries, but the effects of US actions are larger. US antidumping actions
have more impact than EU’s on firm numbers, employees and exports, and EU antidumping
has more influence than US on output, profit and labor productivity. Finally, comparing
Chinese, foreign, and SOE firm’s reactions to US and EU antidumping actions, our results
show foreign firms to be hurt more by antidumping from EU. We discuss policy implications
in a concluding section.

1. Introduction
In this paper, we discuss firm and industry responses in China to
antidumping (AD) initiations and measures. As China’s exports have grown, so
along with them have trade actions against China through antidumping duties.
In the last decades, China was the largest AD initiation and measure recipient
country in the world. There are a lot of reasons why China is a prime target for
those AD measures. One is China’s rapid export growth and the adjustment
pressures these create in foreign markets. Another is China’s non-market
economy (NME) status 1 in key countries (US and EU especially), relatively
ineffective legal defenses, and the low concentration ratio in many Chinese
industries which makes industry coordination to resist these measures more
difficult.
China's NME status is a reflection of its accession terms to the WTO. In
2001, China agreed that it be treated as a NME for 15-years to 2016 (Chen,
2009). As a result petitioners do not have to use Chinese domestic input prices in
determining the cost of the production of an investigated product. This has been
part of the reason for the growth in antidumping initiations against China since
the low cost of labor is the major source of comparative advantage in trade for
China. China’s non-market status also grants greater discretionary power to
initiators which again increased the frequency of AD measures.
When faced with an antidumping measure, a Chinese industry or the firm
may react in various ways. These may include refocusing production on
domestic markets, increased exports to other countries, or location abroad.
Another is producing something else to avoid the foreign trade barriers. Fighting

There are 10 NMEs at present: China, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Vietnam, Albania, Armenia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Mongolia.
Russia was granted market status in 2000, while Vietnam's request for MES has been considered and rejected.

the action and trying to solve the dispute by reaching agreement on a price
undertaking is also an option. The final option is to close down production and
exit the market.
The reaction of Chinese firms and industries to these antidumping actions is
now an important element in the policy debate in China as it affects what to do
in response. If firms can easily adapt by producing different products and
maintain profits and employment, active response seems less of an issue than if
they are severely impacted. Therefore, analysis of the effects of antidumping
actions on Chinese firms as industry groups is central to this debate.
Specifically, we build all firm summed industry and other two kinds of firm
summed (foreign firm and state-owned firm) 2 industrial division group panel
data sets covering 39 industries from 1997 to 2007 for use in our analysis. We
separate out AD actions into those undertaken by developed and developing
countries, and also divide AD actions between the United States (US) and the
European Union (EU). We exam their different effects on exports, output, profit,
total firm number, total employee and industry labor productivity. The results
allow us to assess both Chinese industries’ and firm groups’ reactions. Our
regression method involves system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM)
estimator (Arellano and Bover, 1995; Blundell and Bond, 1998).
In the next section we discuss Chinese AD experience and offer a brief
literature review. Section 3 is data description and methodology. Section 4
reports and discusses empirical results. The final section concludes and discusses
policy implications.

It is important to also analyze private firm group reactions, but because of data availability, we can only obtain three years of this group
data which are not enough for regression analysis, so their reactions can just be deduced indirectly.

2. Chinese Experience with AD and Prior Literature on the Impacts
of AD
According to the WTO antidumping database (WTO, 2010), China was the
recipient of 19.75% of 3427 worldwide antidumping initiations and 21.87% of
2190 antidumping measures globally between 1995 and 2008. In the last three
years, 2006-2008, China was the recipient of 72, 61 and 73 AD initiations and 37,
48, 52 AD measures respectively. These account for nearly 40% of the world
totals (Fig. 1). Compared with China’s total exports, the export value of AD
initiations and measures is not nearly as high since the product coverage of
actions is usually narrowly focused. Per unit export coverage of AD measures in
India and Korea are higher than in China (Fig. 2), but in the top ten AD
measure receivers in the period 1995-2008 China ranks first (Table 1). China’s
main AD initiator complaint countries are India, US, EU, Argentina, Turkey
and Brazil (Table 2).
[Fig. 1- Fig. 2 around Here]
[Table 1- Table 2 around Here]
A significant theoretical and empirical literature devotes exists on the
impacts of AD measures, but does not discuss the Chinese case. Most papers
focus on trade effects and reactions of AD by firms and industries, and find that
AD have both trade depression and trade diversion effects. This literature
includes Staiger and Wolack (1994), Prusa (2001), Ganguli (2005), Baylis et al
(2009), Carter and Trant (2010). Some literature has also explored export or
import countries’ reactions to AD in other dimensions; for example technological
innovation, market power, and pricing etc (Crowley, 2006; Konings and
Vandenbussche, 2005; Duc, 2010).

4

As heterogeneous firm trade theory has evolved in recent years, recent
papers have also studied AD effects in this theoretical framework. These papers
mainly analyze firms’ productivity response to AD protection, and include
Konings and Vandenbussche (2008a), Konings and Vandenbussche (2008b) and
Pierce (2009). There is also some literature analyzing AD effects in other ways.
Brown (2005) uses a specific case study to examine the response of Korean steel
firms after being assessed AD duties in the US. Francois (2009) sets up a global
simulation model for analysis of tariffs and AD policy impacts on price, output,
income and employment.
Literature on China largely analyzes the reasons for AD and does not
empirically analyze AD impacts on Chinese industry or firms. McGee and Yoon
(1998) use five AD action cases initiated by US against China to assess
development impacts. Messerlin (2004) analyzes both China’s antidumping
recipient and user characteristics. Chu and Prusa (2004) study the reasons for
and the impact of AD on China. Park (2009) studies Chinese trade diversion
effects of AD actions. His results show that AD protection has both significant
trade depression and trade diversion effects. Bown and Crowley (2010) analyze
US and EU AD duties impacts on China’s export; findings that trade depression
effects are weak and trade deflection effects are significant.

3. Methodology and Data
In this paper we explicitly study China’s industry and firm group reactions
to AD. We separately compare effects of AD from developed and developing
countries on Chinese industries, and in addition separately analyze the US and
the EU. We use system GMM methods to obtain results.
3.1 Methodology
We use panel data regression to analyze AD effects on Chinese industry and
firm groups. Affirmative and negative measures have different effects.
Additionally, AD can have lag effects. We use an estimation equation (1) where
Yi,t denotes the dependent variable.
ln(Yi ,t ) = α + β1 ln(Yi ,t −1 ) + β 2 ADi,t-1 + β3 ADi ,t + β 4 AD1i,t-1
+ β 5 AD1i,t + β 6 AD 2i,t + β 7 AD3i,t + β8 AD 4i,t +

β9 AD1i,t * AD 2i,t + β10 AD1i,t * AD3i,t +

(1)

β11 AD1i,t * AD 4i,t + β12Time + ε i +υi,t
In our regressions we specifically consider industry exports, output, firm
numbers, profits, and employee and labor productivity as endogenous variables.
Yi,t-1 are one year lag effects of dependent variables. ADi,t-1 and AD1i,t-1 are
separately one year lag terms of ADi,t and AD1i,t. In order to control for long
term trend effects, we add a time trend variable in the equation. In dependent
variables, labor productivity equals added value divided by numbers of
employees. We use logarithmic values in our regressions to simplify the results
and reduce heteroscedasticity. Table 3 summarizes these variables.
[Table 3 around Here]
We use a general-to-specific method to determine the lag length numbers for
dependent and independent variables (Hendry and Clements, 2004) 3 . Our data
3

For dynamic time series data, we can use an AIC and BIC rule to determine lag numbers. But there are no such rules for panel data.
Here in the general-to-specific method developed by Hendry and Clements, the specific rule is first select a large lag order in the
regression, if the coefficient is significant keep it, if not drop.

embodies autocorrelation with one lag and so we include one lag in the
right-hand side of our empirical specification. Because of lags in our dependent
variable, we use dynamic panel methodology to estimate our equations. We
deploy the Arellano-Bond instrumental variable procedure (Arellano and Bover,
1995; Blundell and Bond, 1998) and which proposes a GMM estimator which
accounts for within-panel autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity and estimates
a dynamic panel specification similar to equation (1) above.
The dynamic panel estimator first put forward by Arellano and Bond (1991)
as a first order difference GMM produces estimates after taking first order
differences in order to eliminate individual effects. Such methods however can
induce sample partial bias (Blundell and Bond, 1998). Blundell and Bond (1998)
propose a GMM-system estimator which not only first order differences but also
uses lagged difference variables as instrumental variables to construct level
equations. This method avoids endogeneity problems. This GMM estimator can
be divided into one step and two step forms; the two step GMM method can give
more robust results (Arellano and Bond, 1991; Windmeijer, 2005). Regressions
in our paper are all two step system GMM results of this form.
3.2 Data
We use three data samples; an all firm summed industry sample, a foreign
firm summed group sample, and a state-owned firm summed group sample.
These data are firm summed within industries, and not firms by firm. Each
sample yields observations of 39 industries from 1997 to 2007. Tables 4 and 5
give the overall summary statistics of the dependent and independent variables
in the empirical analysis.
[Tables 4-5 around Here]

7

Data on dependent variables except export values come from the Chinese
Statistical Yearbook, and we use producer price indices as deflators. Export
value data come from the Chinese Customs Statistical Yearbook. The AD data
come from a World Bank global AD database (Bown, 2010). All of the
dependent variables except export values are classified by Chinese “National
Economy Industrial Classification” (NEIC) and have 39 2-digital manufacturing
industries. The independent variables and export values are classified by the
Harmonized System Codes Commodity Classification (HS). They cannot be
directly merged together by industry. We take the NEIC as our benchmark; and
allocate all of the AD cases into NEIC industries according to the detailed AD
products as named one by one. We only have all firm summed industry data for
export values.
The global AD database (Bown, 2010) provides detailed AD case
information by country division. Because our data are firm summed by industry,
we cannot include AD duty variables in our regressions because most cases
involve specific firms. Independent variables in our regressions are thus all
dummies. Hence, if one or more firm in an industry received an AD investigation
or measure in one year, we take that year’s AD investigation or measure variable
to equal 1, otherwise it equals 0.

4. Empirical Results
This section reports our empirical results. Since AD measures from
developed and developing countries may have different effects, we first explore
Chinese industry and firm group reactions with added discrimination among AD
actions by developed and developing countries. Since the US and the EU are the
two main trading partners of China, it is useful to also analyze and compare
their separate AD effects.
The global AD database (Bown, 2010) only has main countries’ AD
information. We take the US and the EU to jointly denote developed countries
(these two countries account for more than 25% of China’s total received AD
initiations and measures (WTO, 2010)); and Argentina, India, Brazil, and
Turkey as developing countries (these four countries account for about 40% of
China’s total received AD initiations and measures (WTO, 2010)).
4.1 Impacts of AD from Developed and Developing Countries on Total
Firm Numbers, Output, Employee, Profit, Labor Productivity and Exports
Tables 6 to 7 report our estimation results. AD from both developed
countries and developing countries adversely affect industry and firm groups’
output, employee, profit, firm numbers, and exports, but improve labor
productivity. Comparatively, profits are hurt the most; the next are employees,
firm numbers, and exports, and output is impacted the least. This suggests that
when facing an AD measure, firms decrease their prices and profits, and then
reduce employment to lower costs, but try to maintain exports and output.
Different kinds of firms also show different kinds of response to AD measures.
All firm summed industry react the most. Foreign and SOE firm groups show a
small reaction. This suggests that AD mainly influences private firms.

9

Developed countries’ AD have greater negative effects than developing
countries’ on all firm summed industry and SOE firm groups. But the foreign
firm group is impacted more by developing countries’ AD. This may because
most foreign firms in China are from developed countries and they can avoid
impacts easily by intra-firm trade adjustments.
AD measures have generally significant effects on firm numbers. Also,
variables related to one year before an investigation or the year of investigation
and measure all have significant positive effects on all firms summed industry,
and developed countries’ ADs have more influence. This suggests that firms
enter the market and increase export before AD investigation and measures
which directly induced other countries’ AD countermeasure. Variables of one
year after measure, one year after if more than one investigation and interaction
term of one year after if affirmative in developed countries and one year after if
affirmative in developing countries also have significant negative effects using all
firm summed industry data. The developed countries’ AD influence is more
pronounced than for developing countries. Foreign firms and SOE firms response
is less. Only variables of one year after if more than one investigation and the
cross term of one year after if affirmative have negative effects. SOE firms show
no significant influence for measures. In our data sample, all firms include SOE,
foreign and private firms, so these results suggest that private firms responded
more in firm numbers.
For Chinese industrial output reaction, variables of one year after measure
and interaction terms of one year after if affirmative and one year after if more
than one investigation all have negative impacts on all firm industry output.
Developed countries’ ADs again have more impact. Variables of year of

10

investigation, measure and before measure in both developed and developing
countries all have positive effects on all firm output. Foreign firm output has
little reaction which may suggest that firms can easily circumvent AD barriers.
SOE firm output shows little response; most of the reaction is by private firms.
Since continuously increasing output may be one of the reasons for AD to China,
these AD investigations and measures may exhibit simultaneity bias in our
regressions.
Chinese industrial employee reaction also shows significant coefficients only
one year after an affirmative decision in developed countries and is significantly
negative for all firm employees. This suggests that all firm employees only
respond to developed countries’ affirmative AD measures. Variables of year of
investigation in developing countries and one year before investigation in both
developed and developing countries have positive relationships with all firm
employees. One year after if affirmative and interaction term of one year after if
more than one investigation in developed countries have large negative impacts
on foreign firm employees. Also, variables of one year after if affirmative, one
year after if more than one investigation from developing countries have negative
impacts on foreign firm employees. Foreign firm employee numbers seem more
sensitive to AD measures, which may because foreign firms are more flexible to
change their workers. SOE firm employee numbers have little reaction to both
developed and developing countries’ AD.
Chinese industrial profit reactions suggest developed countries’ variables of
year of investigation, year of measures, one year after measures and one year
after if more than one investigation are all negatively related with all firm profits.
Developing countries’ influences here are prominently weak. Developing

11

countries’ variables of one year before and year of investigation and year of
measure are all positively related to all firm profits. Total foreign firm profits are
negatively influenced by AD measures from developing countries. Although AD
measures have little impact on exports and output of foreign firms, they impact
their profit significantly. AD has little impact on the profit of SOE firms.
As for as Chinese industrial labor productivity reaction is concerned,
developed countries’ AD investigations and measures have little effect on all firm
industrial labor productivity, only the variable of one year before investigation is
significantly positive. Developing countries’ AD variables are positively related
with labor productivity with large coefficients. This suggests that AD threats
have incentive effects on industrial labor productivity. Labor productivity
improvement for foreign firm summation industry is more than for all firms.
Foreign firms’ larger labor productivity improvement may reflect the larger
negative impact on employees than on output. In contrast, SOE firms’ industrial
labor productivity has virtually no response, but the variable of one year before
investigation has a negative influence, perhaps because SOE firms find it harder
to adjust employees in the short run when facing an AD threat.
Finally comes Chinese industrial export reactions. We only have all firm
summation industrial data on exports. Both developed and developing
countries’ ADs have a negative influence on industrial exports, especially the
variables of year of measure and one year after if affirmative. In general,
developed countries’ AD has a greater negative influence on industrial exports
than developing countries’.
[Tables 6-7 around Here]
Generally, most of the estimation results imply that private firms react

12

much more than foreign and SOE firms. One reason is that Chinese private firms
are the main AD targets and most of the AD initiations and measures from
abroad are aimed at private firms.
4.2 Specific Impacts for AD from U.S. and EU
There is a large difference in the impact of US and EU AD measures. Since
US AD measures are aimed at specific firms, but EU AD measures are largely
against whole industries, a difference in regime affects country results.
Tables 8 to 9 report US and EU AD estimation results. AD from US and EU
have a negative influence on industrial and firm groups’ firm numbers, output,
employees, profits and exports but have positive effects on labor productivity.
AD from US and EU have more impact than for developed and developing
countries, because the US and EU are larger trade partners for China. US AD
measures have more influence than EU’s on firm numbers, employees and
exports; and EU AD measures have more influence than US’s on outputs, profits
and labor productivity. AD from US and EU have little impact on foreign and
SOE firm groups, the same as AD from developed and developing countries.
Comparatively, foreign firms are affected more by AD from EU. This may be
because EU AD has wider scope and foreign firms in China from the EU are
relatively fewer.
Both US and EU variables of year before investigation and measure have a
positive influence on all firm numbers. Variables of one year after if more than
one investigation from both US and EU and one year after measure from US
have significant large negative coefficients, and US’s values are bigger than the
EU, which mean that all firm numbers react significantly both to US and EU
AD and especially to US. Foreign firm numbers have no significant relationship

13

with US AD but are significantly related with EU measures. SOE firm numbers
have actually no significant relationship with both US and EU AD. Overall, all
firm numbers react significantly to both US and EU AD, but foreign and SOE
firm numbers react only a little, most of the reaction is by private firms.
Industrial output reacts only a little to both US and EU AD investigations
and measures, and EU effects are more. Foreign firm output shows little reaction
to AD from US and EU. Both countries’ AD measures have negative impacts on
SOE firm output, and also EU effects are larger.
AD from US has significant influence on all firm industrial employees, but
AD from EU has little negative impact. Foreign firm employees respond
negatively to AD from both US and EU, and US effects are greater. Generally,
foreign firm reactions for employees are smaller than for all firms. SOE firm
employees react little. These results also show that US variable of one year after
if more than one investigation from both countries has negative influence to SOE
firm employees, and also US effect is more intensive. US AD measures seem to
have more employee effects than EU.
The variable of one year after if more than one investigation from both
countries has significant negative impacts on all firm profits, and EU’s influence
is much larger. AD from US has little influence on foreign firm profits. But EU’s
AD has significant negative impact on foreign firm profits. This may be because
the EU is an important export partner for foreign firms. SOE firms’ profits show
little reaction to AD from both countries.
AD from both US and EU have labor productivity incentive effects.
Variables of one year after measures and one year after if more than one
investigation from US and EU separately have positive effects on all firm labor

14

productivity, and overall EU effects are bigger than US. Foreign and SOE firm
labor productivity show no significant response to AD from both countries.
AD from both US and EU have significantly impacts on industrial exports,
and US have more influence. Overall, AD measure impacts on exports are small.
[Tables 8-9 around Here]
4.3 Robustness Checks of Results
Our empirical model contains lag terms for dependent variable, and hence
endogeneity is a potential problem. Our system GMM method can partly
overcome these endogeneity problems. We use two methods to test the validity
of the parameter estimates. The first is the Sargan over-identification test to
assess the validity of instrumental variables. If this cannot reject the null
hypothesis, it suggests that the instrumental variable is appropriate. The second
is using an AR(2) test to check for residual non-autocorrelation, that is testing
the existence of second-order residual autocorrelation.
In the empirical results presented in Tables 6-9, all of the P values for AR(2)
test are bigger than 0.15, so there would seem to be no residual autocorrelation
problem for the estimation. All of the P values for the Sargan over identification
test reveal that instrumental variable selections are appropriate.
In order to further check the robustness of our estimation results we
separate AD from developed and developing countries and AD from US and EU
to estimate results individually. After comparing the mixed and separate
regression results 4 , we find that AD effects from developed and developing
countries, and from US and EU are all the same in both forms of estimation.
These feasibility checks suggest that the estimates presented earlier are robust.
4

Mixed estimation results are presented in the Tables 6 to 9. Separate estimation results for robustness checks are
omitted in the paper because of the limitation of paper length. Readers interested in these results can contact the
authors.

5. Conclusions and Policy Implications
In conclusion, our analysis suggests that AD investigations and measures
have significant impact on Chinese industries and firm groups. AD from
developed and developing countries including US and EU all reduce firm
numbers, output, employee, profit and export, but improve labor productivity.
Comparatively, developed countries’ AD have more severe impacts than
developing countries except for the foreign firm group; and all firm summed
industry react the most. Foreign and SOE firm groups just have a little response.
If we take the US and EU as specific country cases, we find that their
measures have larger impact than those of other developed and developing
countries. Also, US AD measures have more impact on firm numbers, employees
and exports; and EU AD measures have more impact on outputs, profits and
labor productivity. In addition, AD from both countries have only a small
impact on foreign and SOE firm groups. Foreign firm group are relatively
affected more by AD from EU.
From these findings, we can assess overall Chinese industrial and firm
groups’ reactions to AD. They suggest that some Chinese firms have closed
down and exited the market under the pressure of AD. When we compare the
reaction of output and export, we can see that relocation may be happening
since industrial output reacts much more than exports. Firms may also choose to
sell more in domestic or export to other countries to avoid the impacts of AD.
There is no information to indicate whether producing something else has the
reaction, and also we have no data on whether firing against action.
Our results also suggest that Chinese industry and private firm group have
been significantly hurt by AD, but exports are comparatively less affected which

16

may imply trade diversion. From these results, Chinese industry and firms
seemingly might not need to care too much about AD from abroad, but firm
profit and return plus employee have been significantly affected by them, which
means firms have tried to maintain their exports by reducing costs and prices, so
that their trade conditions have deteriorated.
We also show that SOE and foreign firm groups have been less impacted by
AD measures and most of the reactions are by private Chinese firms for they are
the main ones targeted. Also Chinese firm groups respond little to AD from
developing countries. These results suggest that only main trade partners’ AD
measures significantly influence Chinese industry and firms. Thus in guarding
AD response China should perhaps emphasize and pay more attention to main
trade partner’s measures.
