Public Debt and U.S. Saving: A New
Test of the Neutrality Hypothesis

PBSTRACT

The substantial post war decline in the U.S. saving rate has added
great

impetus to the debate over whether public debt policy crowds out saving.

Rather than attempting to reject specific saving models, empirical research
on debt policy and savings has primarily focused on the impact of particular

policy variables on savings. In this paper we examine Barro's infinite horizon,
intergenerationally altruistic model. A distinguishing feature of this model
is that aggregate consumption depends only on collective resources and not the

age distribution of resources.
To test this proposition we specify the Barro model under earnings
uncertainty, rate of return uncertainty, and demographic change and test

whether, given the level of consumption predicted by this model, variables

measuring the age distribution of resources influence actual consumption. Data
on the age distribution of resources are primarily obtained from the annual

Current Population Surveys. Our results imply a rejection of the hypothesis
that aggregate consumption is independent of the age distribution of resources.
They therefore cast doubt on the contention that government debt policy does not

affect

consumption and saving.

The significant postwar decline in the U.S. saving rate is a rather

startling stylized fact that invites explanation. Since 1930 the U.S. has been
saving 14.7 percent of its net national product. This figure contrasts with the
7.8 percent average saving rate of the l9TOs, the 8.7 percent average rate of

the 1960s, and the 8.8 percent average rate of the l950s.- The U.S. saving
rate is quite low not only relative to its own recent past level, but also

relative to the saving rates of its principal trading partners. Since 1960 the
U.S. net national saving rate has averaged only 55 percent of the European OECD
rate and just 314 percent of the Japanese rate.2 Over the postwar period the U.S.

econoIr has experienced remarkable changes in fertility rates, the median age of
retirement, and the rate of female labor force

participation;

but each of these

changes appears more likely to have raised rather than lowered the rate of
saving.

The search for a culprit in explaining the saving reduction has led
naturally

to the federal government's

doorstep. This paper examines the

government's potential role in influencing postwar U.S. saving. As argued in
the next section, a "smoking gun" in this mystery, if one is to be found, is
most

likely hiding amidst the government's intergenerational transfer policies.

Intergenerational transfer policies are referred to here as debt policies; they
may be explicit, in the sense of altering the government's official measure of
its liabilities, or implicit, in which case cross generational transfers arise,
but have no direct impact on accounting deficits.

—2—

Fesolving the impact of debt policy on saving is no easy task. There
are only a few, rather subtle testable differences between, for example, the
life cycle model (Modigliani and Brurnberg (l95)) that predicts crowding out

from debt policies and the infinite horizon Barro (l9T) model that predicts no
crowding out. Section II contains a short discussion of this point and a
description of tests that can potentially discriminate between these models.
The main contribution of this paper is to examine empirically Barro's model of

intergenerational altruism. A restatement of the proposition that intergenera-

transfers do not influence saving is that saving is invariant to the age
distribution of resources.3 This proposition is directly tested by measuring
tional

the excess influence of the age distribution of personal income and components
of personal income on aggregate consumption given the level of consumption

predicted

by our formulation of the Barro model.

This model, which is described in section III, differs from that
underlying the traditional time series consumption regression (e.g., Feldstein
(l971), Barro (19T8), Munnell (l9Tlii, Darby (l9T9)) by explicitly incorporating
earnings

uncertainty, rate of return uncertainty, and demographic change into

the optimal consumption decision. From the perspective of uncertainty models,

the

standard consumption specification seems quite naive; indeed, the failure

explicitly to model uncertainty produces major conundrums over squeezing data
from an uncertain world into a certainty model (Leinier and Lesnoy (1981)). Our
approach to including uncertainty in the analysis involves estimating simple
stochastic processes for earnings and the return to savings and explicitly
solving for the optimal consumption path of the infinitely lived Barro—type

—3—

family. We

then test whether, given the optimal predicted consumption program,

the age distribution of resources has an impact on actual aggregate consumption.
Since the age distribution of resources is obviously influenced br changes in

the population age structure, the model controls for such changes by taking
explicit account of variations in the size and age distribution of the
population.

Section IV contains a description of the data and the specification of

earnings and return uncertainty. The empirical findings are discussed in
section V, and concluding comments appear in Section VI.

I. Government Fiscal Policy and National Saving
In considering the government's potential impact on saving one might
ask whether postwar growth in total (federal, state, and local) government

consumption

relative to NNP

consumption

to

could be a key factor. The ratio of government

NNP has increased, but the increase has been fairly modest.

Government consumption averaged 21.14 percent of net national product in the

1950s, 23.0 percent in the 1960s, 23.5 percent in the 1970s, and 23.1 percent

in the period l980_19814. If, during the last 5 years,

had been 21.14
as

percent rather than 23.1 percent of NNP and if private consumption

averaged

government consumption

had

not changed, the net national saving rate would

have

6.5 percent rather than 14.7 percent. Assuming that private consumption

is invariant to changes in government consumption seems, however, highly

unrealistic. At one extreme, government consumption ny substitute perfectly
for private consumption (Bailey (1961) and David and Scadding (19714)). In this

—

case the 1.1 percentage point increase in the ratio of government consumption to
NNP between the 50s and early BOs would, abstracting from issues of tax
distortions and redistributions, have been completely offset by a 1.7 percentage
point decrease in the ratio of private consumption to NNP, leaving the net

national saving rate unchanged. With government consumption a perfect
substitute for private consumption, the private sector's ultimate disposable
income is simply NNP; and the private saving rate would coincide with the net

national saving rate. From this perspective, the key question is why the
private sector's saving behavior changed such that total consumption, private
plus government, rose as a share of NNP.

At the other extreme, government consumption might not enter private

utility functions at all, or might enter separably. In choosing its consumption
level one would expect the private sector in this case to view NNP—G, where G is
government consumption, as its ultimate disposable income, since current

the

private sector saved 10.9 percent of this definition of

—5--

A second accusation that could be levelled at government policy is
that the use of distortionary taxes to finance both its consumption and transfer

expenditures has reduced incentives to work and save. While there was some
increase in average marginal taxes on labor earnings, the increase was modest

and seems unlikely to account for the decline in the U.S. saving rate. A recent
article by Barro and Sahasakul (1983) suggests that the average marginal tax on
labor income was 22 per cent in the 1950s, 22 percent in the 1960s, and 27
percent in the 1970s.5
These marginal tax figures exclude social security's payroll tax.
However, there is reason to believe that inclusion of Social Security's tax and
benefit provisions in the analysis would reduce rather than raise estimated

marginal labor taxes particularly in the 1970s. Blinder and Gordon's (1981)
analysis suggests that social security's tax and benefit provisions constitute a
sizeable subsidy to labor earnings of married males and others leaving net

effective marginal taxes on labor earnings for these groups quite low. Boskin

and Hurd (198k) confirm the significant size of the Gordon effect. Crediting
the public with the perspicacity and knowledge required to assess correctly the
marginal social security return on the marginal tax contribution may be
unrealistic; but the opposite assumption, that workers believe they receive no
return at the margin for marginal social security tax payments, seems equally

implausible. If one takes an intermediate view that workers view marginal
social security taxes as providing marginal social security benefits of equal

present value, then the post 1950 rise in the average marginal tax on labor
income is adequately captured by Barro and Sahasakul's estimates.

—6—

Marginal saving incentives are

also determined by capital income

studies argue that effective capital income taxes, at least on
corporate source income, rose substantially in the 1970s (e.g., Feldstein and
Summers (1919)). But in contrast to this popular belief that such taxes rose
taxes.

Several

between 1950 and 1980, extensive calculations contained in King and Fullerton

(l98) suggest a small decline in effective marginal taxes on capital income
over this period. The 1981 tax act lowered effective marginal capital income

taxes more significantly. Based on a ten percent pretax return to capital and
the prevailing inflation rate King and Fullerton calculate that the overall
marginal capital income tax

figures just cited for marginal taxes on labor income, these findings suggest
that

the distortive effects of government fiscal policy cannot explain the drop

in the U.S. saving rate over the last 35 years.
Another type of policy that could
decline

is

potentially be

blamed for the saving

intragenerational redistribution from the rich to the poor. The poor

may have a higher rate of time preference than the rich. Alternatively the poor

saving. Emily Lawrence (1983) recently examined the potential effect of

intragenerational redistribution on saving using a life cycle simulation model.
Lawrence considered verj substantial differences in time preference rates between
the rich and poor as well as liquidity constrained consuription by the poor. She

—7—

found that even very significant intragenerational redistribution, such as that
characterizing U.S. welfare programs, has only minor effects on saving in life
cycle models.

The explanation for these small changes in the case of differences in
time preference rates is simply that neither the associated differences in

marginal

consumption propensities across the two groups nor the size of the

simulated transfers are sufficiently large to have much impact on the econorrrj's

total wealth accumulation. In the case the poor are liquidity constrained,

their

marginal consumption propensities are unity; but the change in disposable

income multiplying their unitary propensities is only current transfers. For
rich,

unconstrained transferers, the reduction in current consumption equals

their much smaller marginal propensity to consume multiplied by the present

value of transfers, which is typically a much larger number than simply the

current payment. The reduced consumption of the rich offsets to a significant
extent the increased consumption of the liquidity constrained poor
only

producing

a small reduction in national saving despite a quite substantial program of

intragenerational

transfers.

We conclude from this and

related dels that

intrageneratiorial redistribution is probably not a major determinant of the

decline in the U.S. saving rate since 1950.
A fourth channel by which government policy may have reduced saving is

by transfering resources from younger

tions. Intergenerational

to older genera-

transfers towards older generations, which is

referred

to here as debt policy, can be and have been conducted in quite subtle ways.
The unfunded financing of the U.S. Social Security System is by now a well

quite subtle, debt policy (Feldstein (l971)). Less

unde rstood debt policies are changes in the tax stracture that shift the

burden of taxation from older

to younger age groups

(Summers (1981a), Auerbach

and Kotlikoff (1983a)) and changes in tax provisions that raise market values of
financial assets and, thereby, transfer resources to older age groups who are

the

priinaiy owners of such assets (F'eldstein (1977), Summers

(198Th)).

An

example of the former type of policy is switching from income taxation to wage
taxation. An example of the latter policy is reducing investment incentives
(Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1983b)). Since investment incentives in the U.S. are
effectively provided only to new investment, old capital, capital that has been
fully or partially written off, sells at a discount reflecting the differential

tax treatment. A reduction in investment incentives means a smaller discount

and a capital gain to owners of old capital. Younger and future generations are
worse off as a result of such policies because they rrn.ist now pay a higher price

to acquire

claims to the econoiry's capital stock.

Curiously, public attention has focused only on a subset of official liabili-

ties of the federal government and has essentially ignored both the official
assets of the federal government as well as the official assets and liabilities

the following question: were the

budget constraints of older generations expanded significantly in the

post war period as a consequence of government policy at the. expense of

budget constraints for young and future generations? One might

point, in this context, to the enormous expansion of the social security system
which greatly increased the budget opportunities of the elderly. The problem,
however, with considering any one component of government policy is that it may
have

been instituted to offset some other component; i.e., the postwar redistri-

bution through social security to the elderly y simply represent the
government's way of compensating the elderly for higher income taxes over their
lifetimes or for their contribution to the nation during World War II. Just as
there is no single correct way

—10—

correct way of posing counterfactuals about observed government transfer

poli-

cies. To put this point differently, intergenerational redistribution must
always

be

assessed relative to some benchmark, and the choice of a benchmark

seems inherently subjective. The implication of this point is that any calculation of the magnitude of postwar

intergenerational

transfers will be arbitrary.7

Having conceded this point we believe that at least one interesting,
if arbitrary, counterfactual to pose with respect to postwar U.S. debt policy is

the U.S. Social Security system 'whose unfunded liabilities appear to range
between

4 and 6 times the size of the U.S. government's official liabilities.8

The growth of this program was coincident with the decline in the net national

saving rate. The social security system appears to represent the only
(potentially) discrete postwar intergenerational transfer policy capable of pro-

ducing a major drop in the national saving rate. Simulation studies of the
potential savings impact of unfunded Social Security suggest a possible reduc-

saving rate over the last three and a half decades.

We turn next to a brief discussion of recent empirical attempts to

resolve the impact of debt policies on saving. In the course of reviewing this
literature we indicate that there have been surprisingly few tests designed to
distinguish sharply among

broad models

of saving. Rather than testing more

fundamental propositions of particular saving models, st of the research has
concentrated on the empirical impact of particular policy variables on consuiup—

tion and savings. This focus has been excessive; indeed, in trany studies the
predicted impact of policy variables on dependent variables is the same under
models with quite different implications about the affect of debt policies on
national saving.

II. Empirical Analyses of Debt Policies
Much of the recent empirical research relating to the effects of eco—
nornic deficits falls into two categories: cross—sectional analysis of social
security's

impact on

household wealth accumulation and

time series analysis

of the consumption impact of government policy variables, such as social
security wealth. Many cross—sectional studies have proceeded without clealy
formulating rejectable hypotheses concerning Barro's (197)4) conjecture of

intergenerational altruism. These studies, including those of Feldstein and
Pellechio (1979) and Kotlikoff (1979b), involve regressions of household private

wealth on social security tax and transfer variables. The central question
posed in niuch of this literature is whether households reduce their private

— 12—

asset accumulation when young because of the anticipation of receiving net wind-.

fall transfers when old. The evidence here is mixed, but even if each of these
studies had strongly confirmed the proposition that expected future windfalls
lead to higher current consumption arid, therefore, less private wealth accumula-

tion, the results would still leave unresolved the issue of altruism; the

altruistic hypothesis, like the life cycle hypothesis, suggests that increases
in the future resources of a particular household should raise that household's

consumption and lower its own savings. In the altruistic case, however, the

other altruistically linked households in the extended family. Indeed, a

central proposition of the altruism hypothesis is that the consumption of particular extended family members depends on the resources of other extended

family members. Unfortunately, this latter proposition is not tested in the
cross—section empirical literature, nor does it appear capable of being tested,
at least for the U.S., given available micro data sources (although Kurz (1982)
indirectly examines altruistic behavior using data on transfers.)

While this distinguishing implication of the altruism del has not
been tested, a distinguishing implication of the pure life cycle uodel, that the
elderly have larger marginal consumption propensities, has been directly tested

by Blinder, Gordon, and Wise (1981). Their findings are weakly supportive of

this proposition. Other implications of the life cycle idel have also been
analyzed. For example, Kotlikoff and Summers (1981) find that life cycle saving
cannot explain the bulk of U.S. savings. Several studies addressing dissaving
after retirement by Darby (1978), Mirer (1979), David and Menchik (1980), and

—13—

Bernheim (198i) find either no dissaving or too little to be consistent with the

strict

life cycle model.

The time series analyses of Feldstein (l9'fl, 1982), Munnell (l971),

Barro (1918), Darby (1919), Leimer and Lesnoy (1981), and numerous others have

proved inconclusive. The econometrics here is plagued by problems of
aggregation,

simultaneity, and errors in defining variables such as social

security wealth. Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1983c) demonstrate the problem of the
time

series statistical approach by running the standard time series

specification on simulated data that conformed perfectly to the nonaltruistic,

life cycle hypothesis. The coefficients on the critical social security wealth
variable as well as many other variables proved extraordinarily sensitive to the

choice of sample period. Auerbach and

the time series studies have been quite vague with respect

to which of several (e.g., life cycle, Keynesian, or altruistic) saving models

being tested. As a consequence a variety of ad hoc specifications have

been employed. In a time series context taking the life cycle model as the null
hypothesis immediately runs afoul of the paucity of cohort specific time series

data. Absent such data key

parameters

cannot be identified and one cannot test

two basic propositions of the life cycle models alluded to above: First, that

consumption of a particular cohort depends only
collective

societal

on its own resources and not

resources; and second, that older cohorts have larger rrargi—

nal consumption propensities.

The Barro idel is much more suited to analysis with time series data

since only collective, rather than cohort specific resources are predicted to
influence aggregate consumption. This proposition is particularly

useful

in

incorporating government policy in the model. In a certainty model the private
Barro economy's budget can be written as the economy's total human plus nonhuman resources

value

of

(including those owned by

the government) less the present

government consumption. As described below an analogous private budget

constraint,

involving only government consumption, i.e.,

mation about

requiring no infor-

taxes, arises witri uncertainty.

As mentioned, the key proposition of the Barro ndel that consumption
depends on collective resources and does not depend on the age distribution of

resources is the focus of our empirical work. To test this proposition, we specify

the Barro nde1 under earnings and rate of return uncertainty and determine

whether,

given the consumption predicted by this nodel, variables measuring

the age distribution of resources significantly influence actual consumption.
Data obtained from annual current population surveys on the age distribution of
income, including wages and salaries, property income, and government transfer

payments, are used for this test. In addition, we use data compiled by Dean
Leirner and Selig Lesnoy (1981) on the distribution of net Social Security wealth
by age.

Solving for the Optimal Consumption Program
Our method of deterrriing the optimal consumption plan is to solve

the finite period analogue to the infinite horizon ndel for a time horizon
sufficiently large that extending it would make no difference to our results.
Specifically we solve the finite period model for successively larger values of

where

the number of periods, until the consumption programs for each of

periods converge. Our data covers 19146 through 19814; we choose

2060 as the terminal year. The optimal consumption values for the years 19146 to
19814 based on a terminal year of

2059

were less than a half percent different

from those derived using 2060 as the terminal year.
The finite period problem is solved using dynamic programming. At

IV. Specification of Return and Earnings Uncertainty and Description of the Data
The model outlined in section III assumes that current and future
population age distributions are

known with certainty. To be consistent in

modeling earnings uncertainty, we also assume that Barro

earnings distributions. More generally, we assume that
of earnings is known

Values for the relative earnings profile

come from Social Security data

on median earnings by age and sex.1° There is very little variation in this
profile between 19146 and 19814. For years after 19814 the projected profile of

relative earnings is set equal to the 19814 relative earnings profile. Work

rates by age and sex are reported starting in 1959 in the Employment

Private consumption is measured here as NIA consumer expenditures on

non—durables and serrices plus imputed rent on durables. The BEA consumer
durables series was used in this calculation. The rate of imputation equals the
annual average three month Treasury bill rate less the annual percentage
increase in the POE durables deflator plus an assumed 20 percent depreciation

rate. Government consumption is also corrected for durables consumption. The
stock of government durables, both military and nonmilitary, was divided into

equipment and structures. A 20 percent rate of depreciation was assumed for
government equipment, and a 3

percent depreciation rate was assumed for

government structures. Like demographics and

we

the

age

distribution

of earnings,

assume that the future course of government consumption is known with

certainty. Future government consumption is determined by assuming that
government consumption per capita after 19814 equals the 19814 level of government

consumption per capita. Besides government consumption, the marginal tax on

capital income is the only policy variable influencing the optimal consumption
plan. A 30 percent marginal tax on capital income is used in calculating each
of the consumption functions for the years 19146 through 2060.

Econo,r wide net worth is measured as the sum of private plus govern-

ment reproducible tangible wealth nasured at replacement cost estimated by the
BEA, plus the value of private land estimated by the Federal Reserve. These and

other series are deflated to 19T2 dollars. Given wealth in years t and t+l, and
year t earnings, private consumption, and government consumption, equation (7)
can

rate

be used to solve for r+T. This procedure was used to determine the pretax
of return series for the period 19146

through 19814.

—23—

Data for the age distribution of resources, which, according to the
Barro model, is irrelevant for aggregate consumption, was obtained from the
annual Current Population Surveys (CPS) for the years 1968

While the CPS

data

through

l984.

does not provide information about asset holdings, it does

include property income, wage and salary income, and government transfers
including welfare, food stamps, unemployment compensation, veterans' benefits,

and Social Security retirement and disability benefits. These data and the CPS
population weights are used to construct shares of total income as well as
shares of labor income, property income, and social security income of
households with heads whose ages fafl in particular age categories.

is that all the Xs are zero. Note that the

includes most other consumption theories such as the life cycle nxdel.

Before presenting the results of this regression it is useful to

describe values of the C(

)

series

and changes through time in the shares of

personal income and its components received by different age groups. Table 1

presents actual consumption and consumption predicted by our ndel (C( ))

for

selected years for alternative values of a and y. Consumption is measured

in 1912 dollars. The age—utility weights in this table are set such that Oa
equals .5 for age a less than 16 or age a greater than 85. At age 40 Oa is set
equal to 1. For ages between 15 and 140

declines linearly from 1 to .5

between

Oa rises

linearly from .5

to

1,

and

Oa

ages 40 and 80. Quite similar results

arise for other choices of the values of 0 at ages 15 and 80.
From the preliminary

examination of alternative parameters values

in Table 1, it appears that for certain sets of parameter values the

described

model presented in section III does fairly well in predicting actual consump-

tion.

Of the parameter combinations examined in the table, a value of y

equal

to 2, p equal to .04, and 0 equal to .5, produces the smallest root—mean squared

error for consumption. These parameter values are certainly within the middle
of the range of those that have been estimated.
Table 2 contains, for selected years, various income shares of

households whose heads are in particular age groups. The table also indicates
the fraction of all
displays

the

particular

households with heads in

particular age intervals; and it

ratio of the average income of households with heads in a

age category to the average income of

all

households. Table 2

indicates some sizeable changes in income shares of particular age groups

—25-

between

1968 and 19814. For example, the share of total income of households

with heads age 25 to 34 rose from

18.6

percent to 22.5 percent over the period.

For the 45—514 age group the income share fell during this period from 25.0

percent to 19.3 percent. Many of these changes are explained by changes in the
age distribution of households; the first column of the table is clearly highly

correlated with the second. But there were also changes in income shares over
the period that are not directly related to demographic change. The figures in
column 3 indicate that in 1968

households

with heads age 145 to 514

had average

incomes that were L30 times the overall average household income. In 19814 such
households had average incomes that were 1.140 times the overall average. During

this 11 year period the ratio of the average income of households with 45

drop in its share

of property income between 1968 and 198)4. Similar sizeable changes in income shares

and income ratios are indicated in Table 2 for labor income and transfer income.
Table 3 reports maximum likelihood estimates of equation (15)

excluding income shares, including income shares of all age groups, and
including only the income share of

likelihood

households

age 6

and

older. Maximum

estimates were derived by searching over a grid of values of y, p,

and 0. For each combination of these parameters, (15) was estimated by OLS.
The maximum likelihood estimates are those producing the

of

c.(

smallest residual sum

squares. Following Arnemiya ( ) standard errors were computed by replacing
)

in

(15) with

maximum likelihood

a first order Taylor's approximation taken around the

estimates and estimating the resulting equation by OLS.

—26—

The

coefficients

on the first deritives of

) with

respect to y, p, and

first 0 are approximately equal to the maximum likelihood estimates, and the

standard errors of these and other righthand side estimated coefficients are
consistent

and asymptotically efficient if ct is i.i.d., normal.
The first column of Table 3 confirms the point made above, that our

model tracks actual consumption fairiy well. The
values of 'y'

is .958, and the estimated

and p are both significant and reasonable. The coefficient on

is .172 and is significantly different from 1 at the 5 percent level. In

addition, the intercept is significantly different from zero. Both of these

results are at odds with the prediction of our ndel. Also at odds with our
model is the siificance of the 65+ income share in column (2) and the five
total income shares included in column three. The critical F(5,7) for the
inclusion of all the shares at the 5 percent level is 3.97, which is below the F

of 5.85 calculated for the inclusion of the five shares. The sign and to some
extent pattern of the income share coefficients accord with the prediction of
the life cycle model that redistribution from younger to older age groups raises
consunrption. According to these estimates a redistribution of 10 percent of
income from the youngest to the oldest age group would raise U.S. consumption by

.7 percent, evaluated at the mean value of consumption. With prevailing saving
rates, a .7 percent increase in consumption would lower the net national saving
rate by over 10 percent.
The significance of' age resource distribution variables does not apply

to the three components of income for which we have separate data, labor income,

—27—

property income, and social security income. To reduce computation costs we
constrained y, p, and 0 in this analysis to equal their imxiiaim likelihood esti—

mates from column (1), Table 3. The F(5,l0) values for the inclusion of the
shares of labor income, property

income, and social security income are 1.87,

2.08, and 1.51, respectively. While these values are each below the critical F
of 3.33, if one constrains b1 to equal zero and b2 to equal 1, the respective
F(5,12) values are 12.2 for total income shares, 114.8 for labor income shares,

9.9 for property income shares, and 5.6 for social security income shares. The
critical F(5,l2) for this test is 3.11. Hence, the data reject the hypothesis
that age—resource shares are irrelevant given the mndel's predicted values of
b1 and b2.
To examine whether the significance of the age resource variables is
robust to choices of y, p, and 0 that differ from the n.xiinuni likelihood esti-

mates, we tested the significance of the total income shares for several different

choices of these three rameters. The critical F value for these
tests is F(5,10)3.33. For l0, p.01, and 0.5 the F statistic is 16.75; for
y=l.1, p.014, and (3=.5 the F statistic is 1.59; for y=2, p=.l5, and 0=.5 the F
statistic is 3.78, and for p.O5, y1.5, and e=.8 the F statistic is 14.75.
Hence, for a range of a priori choices of y, p, and 0, nst, but not all, of the
test statistics for the inclusion of income shares are significant.
constrained

Table 14 presents maximum likelihood estimates of (15) for

the period
1917 to 1977 using levels of net Social Security wealth of different age groups.
For this 31 year sample period, the maximum likelihood estimates of y, p, and 0
are

close to those reported in Table 3. While

b2 is not

significantly different

—28—

from unity,

as predicted by the theory, b1 is significantly different from

zero.

In addition, the Social Security wealth levels of different age groups are

significant explanatory variables. The F(6,20) statistic for their inclusion is
16.2, which exceeds the 5

percent

critical value of 2.60.

VI. Conclusion
The results presented here clearly reject our formulation of the

altruism model. However, it should be restressed that the model imbeds strong
assumptions not only about preferences, but also about the extent and nature of
uncertainty.

Rather than a rejection of altruism, the significance of the age

resource shares may reflect misspecification of the altruism model that

is

correlated with age resource shares. For example, the age resource shares might
conceivably enter in the processes determining earnings and rates of return.

In this case, the state variables, S, in c(

) should

include the age resource

information, and the exclusion of this information would bias the results.

Alternatively, there may be a large number

of discreet altruistic families with

different

age structures. In this case, changes in the age distribution of

resources

will typically be associated with changes in the interfamily

distribution of resources, and such changes would be expected to alter aggregate
consumption)-2
The paper's contribution is, hopefully, not only to test a particular
formulation of the Barro proposition, but to stimulate additional research that
directly

tests central implications of lifecycle and altruistic saving models.

One might argue that zero intergenerational transfers is an objective
benchmark. There are at least two problems with such a benchmark. First,
distinguishing negative intergenerational transfers from taxes required to
finance government consumption is completely arbitrary. Second, past
intergenerational transfers imply (require) offsetting current or future
intergeneration transfers. Hence, taking zero intergenerational transfers as
the benchmark requires considering a world in which intergenerational transfers

in the past had always been zero.
