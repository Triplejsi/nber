Unempolyment, Disequilibrium, and
the Short Run Phillips Curve:
An Econometric Approach

ABS TRACT

The paper specifies a disequilibrium model for the aggregate
labor market consisting of demand and supply functions for labor,
an adjustment equation for wages as well as for prices, a
transactions equation and, finally, an equation that relates
measured unemployment to vacancies and to excess demand. The
model has a more sophisticated treatment of dynamics than earlier
disequilibrium models) and uses measured unemployment as an
endogenous variable. Two of the error terms are assumed to be
serially correlated and the coefficients are estimated by maximum
likelihood. The parameter estimates and the goodness-of-fit are
satisfactory and the model's implications for the behavior of
several important variables are sensible. Excess demand
estimates computed in various ways are reasonable. The model is
used to estimate the natural rate of unemployment as well as a
short run Phillips curve. Finally, the stability properties of
the model are analyzed by considering the eigenvalues of the
system; they are found to have moduli less than one.

1. Introduction

Two major approaches to the study of unemployment have been

followed. The equilibrium model assumes that real wage rates instantaneously adjust so as to bring the supply and demand of labor into

equality. Unemployment is a consequence of erroneous expectations,
and/or intertemjoral labor supply substitution, and/or government pol-

icies such as unemployment insurance.' In contrast, the disequilibrium
model allows for the possibility that the real wage may fail to equate

the supply and demand of labor. Unemployment occurs when the quantity
of labor supplied exceeds the quantity demanded at the going real wage.

Typically, in these models it is assumed that the observed quantity of
labor during any given period is the minimum of the quantity demanded
and the quantity supplied.
In the United States, most empirical work has followed the

equilibrium paradigm. Part of the reason may be ideological——failure of
markets to clear is generally viewed as concomitant with the failure of
some agents to optimize, a notion that is heretical according to the

neoclassical religion. Certainly, the inability to articulate a compelling choice—theoretic explanation for real wage stickness is a
problem for disequilibrium advocates.2 Moreover, disequilibrium models

are much more difficult to deal with computationally. Standard econometric software packages generally cannot be used, and difficult non-

linear estimation problems often emerge. As a consequence,
disequilibrium models that are quite simple from an economic standpoint

are quite complicated computationally. Hence, compared to their
equilibrium counterparts, disequilibrium models appear rather

—2—

unsophisticated.
Proponents of disequilibrium models are apt to point out that
despite difficulties in explaining precisely why the labor market does
not clear at every moment in time, the real world does seem to be like

that, and this fact should be reflected in economic analysis. As Rees
[1970, p. 234] observes,

"Although we know very little about the exact
nature of the costs of making wage changes,
we can infer that they exist. Wages are, next
to house rents, the stickiest general class of
prices in the economy, seldom adjusted more
frequently than once a year. This stickiness
may be reinforced by unionism and collective
bargaining, but it was present long before
unions arrived."

In this paper we do not attempt to settle the equilibrium versus

disequilibrium controversy.3 Our goal is rather to put the two types of
models on a more equal standing by estimating an economically richer
disequilibrium model than has hitherto been studied.

The model, which is presented in Section 2, relates measured
unemployment rates to the "true" excess supply of labor, has relatively
sophisticated nominal wage and price dynamics, and allows estimation of

the short run inflation—employment trade—off. Estimation issues are

discussed in Section 3. Among the econometric features of the analysis
are the presence of corrections for autocorrelation and the inclusion of

non—linearities in the variables. Both of these are difficult to deal
with in a disequilibrium context. The model is estimated with annual
U.S. data for the period 1929—1979, and the results are analyzed in

Section 4. Section 5 concludes with a summary and suggestions for
future research.

2. The Model

We consider a system of six equations, one each for the marginal
productivity of labor, the supply of labor, the observed quantity of
labor, nominal wages, the price level, and the vacancy—unemployment rate

relationship. The deterministic version of each equation is discussed
in turn. We defer until Section 3 the matter of stochastic specification.

Marginal productivity of labor. Profit maximizing behavior by
firms conditional on output leads to a demand function for labor of the

form

D (w/P,
where

t)

is quantity demanded in year t, (W/P) is the real wage,

is real output, and t is a time trend.

is the notional

demand in the sense that it is the amount of labor that firms desire to

employ at wage (W/P) —— not necessarily the quantity they will end up
hiring.

For purposes of estimation, a log—linear approximation (except for
t) is employed:

ln Dt = a0 + a1 (W/P) + a29.nQ + cz3t .

(2.1)

Formulation (2.1) (or a minor variant) is a common starting point for
studying labor markets (see, for example, Lucas and Rapping {l970],

Rosen and Quandt [1978], Romer, [1981], Smyth [undated], and

Hajivassiliou [1983]). Nevertheless, ideally one would want to study a

—4—

multi—market model in which output was treated econometrically as an

endogenous variable. This task is beyond the scope of the current
study, and for tractability it will be assumed that output is exogenous.
Note that equation (2.1) assumes that notional demand in a period

depends only on other variables during the same period. Given that our
data are annual, this does not strike us as unreasonable. Nevertheless,

we estimated a variant of the model which included lagged output. As
noted below, the coefficient on lagged output was marginally significant
statistically, and its inclusion had only a trivial impact on the other
coefficients.

Supply of labor. The total number of manhours supplied in year t

depends upon the real net wage, (W/P) , and the potential labor
force, Ht , which is essentially a scale variable to. capture the effect
of population growth. Again assuming a log—linear specification:

ln S =

+

lnt''t ÷ 2't

(2.2)

where S denotes notional supply.4 Tne basic theory of labor supply
suggests that non—labor income belongs in equation (2.2). However,
Romer [1981] points out that unearned income is endogenous in a life—
cycle model of labor supply determination, and shows that more sensible

results can be obtained when it is omitted. Equation (2.2) is very
simple in that it ignores the possible role of intertemporal labor

supply substitution. Dealing with this problem rigorously requires
careful modelling of future wage expectations, a task that is beyond our

scope. (See Altonji [1982].) However, some simple expectational models

—5—

imply that the lagged wage as well as its current value appear in the

supply equation. Such a formulation is discussed below.
Observed quantity of labor. in an equilibrium model, the observed
quantity of labor is determined by the intersection of the supply and

demand curves. In a disequilibrium model, this is not the case. In
conformity with most of the work in disequilibrium theory, we assume
that the quantity observed is the minimum of the quantities supplied and
demanded at the current wage:

£nLt =

mm

(2.nS, £nD) .

(2.3)

Clearly, eq. (2.3) does not describe completely what is presumably a
very complicated rationing story, in which some submarkets have excess

demand and some have excess supply. (See Hajivass!liou [1983].)
However, the simple "mm condition" helps keep the problem tractable,
and we think that it is a reasonable approximation.5
Taken together, eqs. (2.1), (2.2), and (2.3) form the bare bones

disequilibrium model. Such equations have been estimated by several
investigators, often with the addition of a wage adjustment equation
which makes the change in real wages some function of excess demand.

(See, for example, Rosen and Quandt [1978].) These studies have
demonstrated the computational feasibility of disequilibrium estimation,
and indicated the promise that such models have for explaining the time
series data.

Still, these models suffer from several deficiencies: (1) They do
not show how official unemployment rates and the history of wage and

—6—

price changes might affect current nominal wage rates. (2) They assume
that product prices are exogenous. In particular, past changes in norni—
nal wages exert no impact on the current price level.

(3) They ignore

information in official unemployment rates that might be exploited to

help estimate the excess demand for labor. The remaining equations of
the model remedy these problems.

Nominal wage adjustment. We assume that this year's nominal wage
rate depends upon the last two yearst nominal wages, upon this year's

official unemployment rate (Ut) , and upon recent changes in prices;

nWt =

+ _.linwt_l +
+

Y4

+ r3(LnP—znP1)
+

nW2

(2.4)

Lagged wages are included because of the possibility that adjustment to

new wage levels is sluggish. The presence of the official unemployment
rate reflects the possibility that when the labor market is slack (high

U) , then nominal wages will be lower, ceteris paribus, and vice versa.
Now, it is well known that unemployment as measured in the official sta—
tistical series does not correspond well to the theoretical notion of

unemployment as the inability to find work at the going wage. Why

then, include excess demand, (Zn1 —

; they have to rely on their perceptions of the labor

market situation, and these are well—measured by U
Lagged prices are included because of the expectation that workers'

—7--.

nominal wage requests will depend on the extent of recent price changes.
Ceteris paribus, higher prices will result in high nominal wages.

(Indeed, in much of the union sector, indexing is formally built into

wage contracts.) The particular lag structure embodied in (2.4) was
selected after some experimentation with other formulations. As usual,
theory does not give much guidance with respect to the pattern of lags,
and eq. (2.4) was superior to several alternatives in the sense of
leading to the best fit to the data.

Price adjustment. The price level this period depends upon the
lagged price level and the recent history of nominal wage changes:

+ 5iLnP

i

+ s2(LnW_tnW1) + 3(LnW1_2.nW2) (2.5)

The logic here is very similar to that of (2.4). The lagged price term
reflects sluggishness in the price adjustment process. Lagged nominal
wages are included because producers take factor costs into account when
setting their prices. (Such behavior is consistent with, for example,
simple mark—up models of pricing behavior.) Note that because we do not
attempt to model disequilibrium in the goods market, excess demand does
not appear in (2.5).

Vacancy—unemployment relationship. Let V be the vacancy rate in

year t and

be the official unemployment rate, both measured as

fractions. Ignore for the moment that

does not measure correctly

the discrepancy between the amount of labor supplied and the amount

workers desire to supply at the prevailing wage. Then by definition,

D =

L(l+V)

and S =

L(l+U)

Unfortunately,

(2.6)

U.S. annual data for the vacancy rate do not exist for

our sample period. Pencavel [1974] suggests that the vacancy rate is a
stable function of the unemployment rate which can be approximated by
the hyperbolic relationship6

V = A/Ut
where A

is a parameter. Substituting into (2.6) gives us

(2.8)

Eq. (2.8) gives the relationship between the official unemployment rate

and the excess demand for labor. It does not hold as an identity
because:

(a) U measures the "true" unemployment rate with error, and

(b) Eq. (2.7) holds only as an approximation.

All the equations (except (3.3)) differ from their counterparts above by

the additidn of the error terms u1, ...,u5 , whose joint distribution is specified below. Appending an error term to the "mm

condition"

is possible in theory, but it leads to a substantial increase in computational costs.
It is routine to establish that the system (minus eq. (3.3)) satisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions for identifiability in a

non—linear system. (See Fisher [1966].)
Data. We describe here briefly the definitions of the variables.
The sources and methods of construction are detailed in Appendix 3.
The data are annual observations on the U.S. economy for the years

1929 through 1979. Lt is total private hours worked per year expressed

in billions. The nominal gross hourly wage measured in dollars, W

is formed by dividing total civilian compensation by Lt

number of people between the ages of 16 and 65, and multiplying by the

average number of hours worked per person. The implicit assumption here
is that in any given year, those absent from the labor force can potentially contribute an annual number of hours equal to the average of
those in the labor force.

tax rate as computed by Barro and Sahasakul {i983]. Finally, U is
the official unemployment rate as a fraction of the civilian labor
force.

Stochastic specification and estimation procedure. We assume that

the error terms u. (i1,...,5) are distributed normally with mean
zero and diagonal covariance matrix with element

(i1,...,5) on

the main diagonal. For our first set of estimates (Model 1), we assume

that E(ujtuT) =

0

for il,...,5 and all t not equal to t.

In

Model 2 this assumption is relaxed and the error terms in equations
(3.4) and (3.5) are permitted to have first order serial correlation.

Typically, serial correlation is ignored in disequilibrium models
because its presence in equations involving latent variables tends to

render the likelihood function intractable. (For special exceptions,
see Laffont and Monfort [1979], Quandt [1982]). For our case, serial

—U—
correlation is introduced in the two equations not involving latent
variables, which makes the likelihood complicated but not intractable.
To our knowledge, such a generalization has not been attempted before.
For all cases estimation is by maximum likelihood; the relevant

derivations arein Appendix 1.

The likelihood functions were maximized

numerically, using a variety of optimization algorithms9 and numerically evaluated derivatives were employed.

tional levels.
The supply parameters also show substantial stability across

models. The elasticity of labot supply with respect to the after—tax
wage,

,

is

about 0.12. Analyses of time series data have con-

sistently fourd labor supply elasticities that are small in absolute

value. The elasticity of labor supply with respect to the potential

number of hours, 2 is 0.56, which is lower than one would expect.
Even given the fact that the demographic composition of the labor force
has changed considerably over time, one still expects that at least
roughly, a one percent increase in the potential work force should lead

to a one percent increase in labor supply. The reason for the observed

result probably lies in the strong collinearity between Ht and W
The simple correlation between the two variables is 0*998.10 An ordi-

nary least squares regression of hours worked on Ht alone gives a
coefficient on Rt of 0.923 with a standard error of 0.154.
The parameters of the nominal wage adjustment equation are quite
sensitive to whether autocorrelation coefficients are being estimated or

not.11 The coefficient on lagged nominal wages,

,

is

in the reaso-

nable range from 0.64 to 0.93. In both models, the coefficient of
is negative, indicating that a higher official unemployment rate is

associated with lower nominal wages and conversely. However, with the
autocorrelation correction, the absolute value increases substantially

(from 0.45 to 1.66), and becomes more significant as well. The positive

coefficient 13 indicates that increases in prices become translated
into higher current nominal wage. This effect is again larger and more

—13—

significant in Model 2, although it fails to be significant at the 0.05

level. The coefficients of the lagged price change,
twice lagged wage,

,

, and

of the

are relatively small and insignificant in Model

1, and are both significant in Model 2 at conventional levels.

In the price adjustment equation, lagged price has a coefficient of

1.03 in both models.'2 The values of

and

are positive in both

models (and both statistically significant in Model 2), which suggests
that lagged changes in nominal wages have a positive effect on this
period's prices.

Finally, we turn to the vacancies—unemployment relationship. The
only parameter to be estimated here is X , whose value is 0.0014. The
positive value is expected: When unemployment increases, the vacancy
rate decreases. We discuss below whether the magnitude of the estimated

A is sensible.
Comparing Models 1 and 2, it is clear that the standard asymptotic
likelihood ratio test rejects Model 1 in favor of Model 2.

Hence, in

discussing goodness of fit and other issues below, we concentrate on
Model 2.

Variations on the Basic Model. To assess the robustness of our
results, a number of alternative models were estimated. Some of these
alternatives are obtained from Model 2 by omitting certain parameters,

others by adding some variables and parameters. The alternatives are as

The likelihood values for the various models are reported in Table

Table 2. The conclusion is that Model 2 strongly rejects Models 3, 4
and 5; in turn, Models 6, 7 and 8 are unable to reject Model 2. In particular, the sign of

is positive in Model 7, negative in Model 8

—15---

and has a t—value of less than 0.61 in both cases. There appears to be
no support for the contention that unemployment benefits influence
supply negatively.

With respect to models 9, and 10, it appears that on the basis
of standard chi—squared tests, the data are consistent with the presence
of lagged right hand side variables in the demand and supply equations.
Importantly, however, in none of the cases in Table 2 do the parameter
estimates differ substantially from those reported in Table 1.
Moreover, the qualitative behavior of the system does not change
substantially as a result of those minor parameter changes which do

occur. This is very comforting in light of the fact that highly nonlinear systems often generate unstable results. For the sake of simplicity, then, we will continue to base our discussion on the parameters in
Table 1.

Another concern relating to the robustness of our estimates is the
possibility that they are driven by the Great Depression, which occurred

in the early years of the sample. To investigate this issue we re—
estimated the model starting with the year 1938 instead of 1929. The
parameters estimates for the 1939—1979 period (which are available upon
request to the authors) are substantially the same as those for the
1929—1979 period.

Goodness of Fit. How well does Model 2 "explain" the time series
data? To explore this question, we computed for each period the model's

prediction for quantity of labor (LnL) ,

price level (nP) , nominal

wage (LnW) , and official unemployment rate (Us) •13 For every

and then computed the R2 .

For

all variables, the R2s are high. Of course, this observation does not
prove that the model is "right." After all, the current values of £nL
depend on their lagged values, and given the high amount of

and

autocorrelation in the data, any macroeconomic model with lagged depen-

dent variables is likely to perform well by this criterion. On the

other hand, £nL and

are not functions of their past values, yet

Excess Demand for Labor and Unerployment Predictions. One of the
main reasons for estimating a disequilibrium model of the labor market

is to produce estimates of excess demand. The strength of excess demand
can be measured in several ways:
(1)

— £nS).

The model produces estimates of the

logarithms of the notional demand and supply for labor each period.
Their difference, the percentage excess demand for labor, provides a
measure of unemployment that, in theory, is superior to the official

measure. For each period we computed the model's reduced form predic—

—17—

tion of excess demand by substituting the appropriate values of the exogenous and lagged endogenous variables into equations (3.1) —

(3.6),

solving the entire system for the jointly dependent variables, and com-

puting £nD — LnS
(ii) Simulated Average (nDt

—

£nSt).

In non—linear systems, the

predictions obtained simply by substituting exogenous and pre—determined

variables may be misleading. Therefore, we performed some stochastic
siiailations. (See Portes, Quandt, Winter and Yeo [1983].) The

simula-

tion strategy was to solve for the jointly determined variables after we
added to each structural equation a normal deviate with the same

variance as was estimated for that equation. Repeating this procedure
100 times for each time period, we could obtain the average excess
demand for each period over the 100 replications.

(iii) Pr(D > St L). In some sense, measures (i) and (ii) are
point estimates of excess demand. It may be of some interest to know
the probability that there was excess demand at all. We therefore compute for each year the probability of excess demand (conditional on the
amount of labor.)16

(iv) Simulated Fraction of Times that Dt > S. As in (ii) above,
we simulated the model 100 times each period, and found the fraction of
times that demand exceeded supply.

In Table 4 we display the four measures for each year, as well as

the actual official unemployment rate. As expected, the values of all
the indicators in 1932—1940 indicate very substantial excess supplies.
More generally, all series tell a very similar story qualitatively.

Both

the estimated excess demand and the average excess demand in the

simulations are negative in all years except 1942—45, 1952—53, 1979,

(and 1978 just for (mD—inS)). The somewhat suspect notion of excess
demand in 1979 is confirmed by the simulation experiments, which indi-

cate that the probability of excess demand in 1979 is 0.51. A possible
additional reason for preferring model 10 of Table 2 is that its simulated fraction of excess demands for that year drops to 0.07, a more
plausible magnitude.

The probabilities of excess demand by the two measures show fairly
substantial agreement with the patterns of excess demand and fair

agreement with one another. On the whole, the two excess demand

measures and the simulated fraction of times that D > St agree better
with one another than any of these agrees with Pr{Dt >

S

L}. A pro-

bable reason for this discrepancy is that the latter measure is con-

ditional

on the observed L whereas the former three are not.

Dynamics and Stability. A question of some interest is whether

prices

and wages in the model are locally stable. Doubts about the sta-

bility of the system might be created by the observation that in the
price equation, the coefficient on lagged price,

,

exceeds one.

(See Table 1.) Of course, with a system of difference equations greater
than order one, all parameters must be examined simultaneously.

To begin, since equation (3.6) is nonlinear in U , we expand in
Taylor series about an arbitrary value U0 ,

Stability requires that the roots of the characteristic polynomial for

the system (4.1), (4.2) lie within the unit circle. As we show in
Appendix 2, this condition is satisfied for most plausible values of

U0
Vacancies. Recall equation (2.7), the relationship between the
unobserved vacancy rate (Vt) ,
(TJ) , and

the

observed official unemployment rate

the parameter A : V A/Ut .

Another indicator of the

plausibility of our model is whether the magnitudes of the implied

values of the vacancy rate are reasonable. To investigate this issue,
note from equation (3.6) that vacancies are equal to excess demand plus

the official unemployment rate. We can therefore substitute our
estimates of

St and

into (3.6) to calculate Vt

the simple inverse relationship posited between

17

Given

and V , we know

that V will be relatively low during the depression, high during
World War II, etc. What is reassuring about the results is that the
absolute magnitudes seem quite reasonable, something that is not

guaranteed by the mere fact that A > 0 .

Specifically,

from 1932 to

—20—

1940 the estimated vacancy rate is less than 1 percent, during 1943—45
it rises as high as 20 percent and varies between 2 and 6 percent
thereafter.

"Natural Rate of Unemployment". Another important feature of any
aggregative model of the labor market is its implications for the
"natural rate of unemployment" —— the official rate of unemployment that

is compatible with constant growth of prices and nominal wages. We im-

pose a constant rate of inflation by requiring P —1 W — W_1 =

C

in equations (3.4) and (3.5), where G is a constant. Some tedious
but straightforward algebra reveals that the official rate of

unemployment compatible with these conditions, U ,

In soxi macroeconomic models, U

is

required to be independent of

value of G . That requirement is not imposed here, so we compute
for several values of C . Substituting 1979 magnitudes for the
variables into (4.3) and values of G equal to 0.0, 0.03 and 0.05,
the

yields values of U of 7.6,

4.3, and

2.3

percent,

respectively. It

also turns out that the natural rate declines almost monotonically from
the 1930's to the present, suggesting that the unavoidable unemployment

—21—

cost of price and wage stability is declining. We conjecture that this
result is driven by the very high rates of unemployment during the
1930's.

A related question is what level of official unemployment would be
associated with "true" zero excess demand in the labor market ——

(D

—

S)

= 0

.

To compute this figure, we simply note from equation

(3.6) that when Dt =

S

— Ut

,

0 ,

and find the U

that

satisfies this relationship. According to this calculation, when official unemployment is about 3.7 percent, the labor market is actually in
equilibrium.

"Phillips Curve". What does our model imply about the short run
trade—off between official unemployment and wage inflation? Of course,
these two variables are jointly determined, so it does not make sense
simply to plug in the value of one and find the implied value of the

other. Instead, we consider how both would move under alternative
aggregate demand policies. Specifically, the exogenous values of the

are set equal to their 1979 values. We then

model except output

substitute a number of hypothetical values for Q1979 into the system,
some higher than the actual value in 1979, and some lower. For every

value of Q1979 ,
U1979

the

model is solved to find the associated values of

and (in W1979 —

in

W1978) .

The results represent an almost

linear relationship characterized by the equation (W/W) = — 2.06U + 0.19
To attain a nominal wage growth of only 3.7 percent could require an
official unemployment rate of 7.4 percent. Alternatively, if the official unemployment rate were 3.4 percent, one would expect nominal wage

—22—

growth of 12.0 percent. The (approximate) equations for the Phillips
curve for other years in the 1970's are very similar.

The conceptual experiment behind these calculations concerns the

short run trade—off between U and (W/W). It is now widely agreed
that in the long run, the rate of unemployment is independent of the

inflation rate. Although we considered imposthg this constraint on the
model, we ultimately decided that a better strategy would be to let the
data determine the coefficients, and to refrain from giving these estimates a long run interpretation.

5. Conclusions

We have specified and estimated an aggregate disequilibrium model
of the labor market which allows determination of nominal wages, prices,

labor demand and supply, and the official unemployment rate. The parameter estimates are quite reasonable; the system provides a good fit to
the data; and its implications for the behavior of several important

variables are sensible. Of course, more remains to be done. Two of the
more vexing problems in the current model are the exogeneity of output

and the absence of any important role for expectations. Work is
currently under way to remedy these problems.

This research also demonstrates that despite the fact that the computational burden of estimating disequilibrium models is high, such

models can successfully be estimated at reasonable cost. This is true
even for systems that go beyond the "bare bones" approach of earlier

papers. We hope that this knowledge will encourage other investigators.

Appendix 3. Data

This appendix describes the sources and methods of construction of

the variables in the model. Throughout, we abbreviate "National Income
and Product Accounts of the United States" as "N.I.P.A.".

Lt total civilian hours worked per year expressed in billions, is
total hours minus hours worked in the military. For 1948—79, the
following procedure is used. To find hours worked in the military, corn—
pute the ratio of the number of military workers to the total number of
government workers (N.I.P.A. 1929—19 76, pp. 267—69 and N.I.P.A.

1976—1979, p. 55) and multiply by the number of hours worked by government enployees (N.I.P.A. 1929—1976, p. 271 and N.I.P.A. 1976—1979,

p. 56). This gives hours worked in the military, which is then
subtracted from total hours (N.I.P.A. 1929—1976, p. 271, N.I.P.A.
1976—1979, p. 55).

For 1929—42, comparable data do not exist. Using slightly different methods, Rosen and Quandt (1978) constructed a series on civilian

hours extending back to 1929. To splice the two series together, for
the period 1948 to 1973 we estimated a regression of the logarithm of
civilian hours as calculated above on a time trend and on the logarithm

of the Rosen—Quandt measure. The R2 was 0.992. We then substituted
values of the Rosen—Quandt measure for 1929 to 1947 into the regression
equation, and used the fitted values.

W, gross hourly nominal wage measured in dollars, is the ratio of

—30—

total civilian compensation to civilian hours worked. Total civilian
compensation in total compensation of employees (N.I.P.A. 1929—1976,

pp. 238—42 and N.I.P.A. 1976—1979, p. 52) minus compensation of military
employees (Historical Statistics of the United States, p. 235; N.I.P.A.

1929—1976, p. 240—42; N.I.P.A. 1976—1979, p. 52). The computation of
civilian hours worked is described above.

2There have been a number of attempts along these lines. See,
e.g., Stiglitz [1984].
3One reason for the difficulty in settling the question statistically is that sophisticated versions of either model may not be con-

veniently nested within each other. Rosen and Quandt [1978] examine
very simple equilibrium and disequilibrium models, and find that the
latter does a better job of explaining the data.
4We also estimated some versions of (2.2) which include as a
variable the unemployment insurance replacement rate.

(See Smyth

[undated] .) As noted below, this had no effect on our substantive

results.

5An alternative notion of disequilibrium has been suggested by Chow

[1977] and implemented by Sarantis [1981]. Here disequilibrium is
modelled not by a "mm condition', but as a situation in which both
prices and quantities adjust slowly each period to their long run values.
There is no point in engaging in a semantic discussion of which is the

real" disequilibrium model. Suffice it to say that very different
maintained hypotheses are used.

6We experimented with the more general formulation

Vt =

X2I(U_X,) +

X3

,

and found that it did not significantly increase

the explanatory power of the model.

7hajivassiliou [1983, p. 20] argues that in the demand for labor
equation, the wage should be deflated by the producers' price index.

However, he finds that the choice has virtually no effect on the parameter estimates.

is done below.
13This was done by substituting the appropriate values of the

exogenous and predetermined variables into (3.1) —

(3.6),

and solving

for the endogenous variables. The value of Lt was the minimum of the

S and Dt so generated. To solve for U we:

W, P in terms of Ut;

(i) solve for Dt, S,

(ii) substitute the results for Dt and St

in the unemployment vacancies relation, and then (iii) solve the

resulting quadratic for TJ.

which can be com-

puted once the estimated parameter values are substituted. However, in
some applications these probabilities have been found to be very close

to the conditional probabilities. (See Burkett [1981].)
1 When we substitute actual rather than estimated values of the

official unemployment rate, qualitatively similar results emerge.
l8Note that under this assumption, it follows from equation (2.4)

that U will generally depend on both the level of the real wage and
the rate of inflation. However, if

then U depends

only on G , a much more plausible result. Note from Table 1 that the
sum does appear to be quite close to unity. Indeed, when we imposed the
constraint 11 + '(5

1 in model 2, the loglikelihood was 455.25, indi-

cating that the data are compatible with the constraint.
