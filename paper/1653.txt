Nearly one in five full—time equivalent employees in the U.S. works
for some branch of government; one—fifth of compensation of employees is paid by

governments. In many labor markets, such as for school teachers, protective
service workers, health sector workers, and white collar workers, in general,

government plays an even larger, sometimes, predominant rDle on the demand side
of markets.

How do governments act as employers of labor? Are public sector wages
and employment unresponsive to changing economic conditions, as is often held?
Are government workers generally paid a premium over comparable private sector
workers or do public/private pay differentials varj with economic conditions?
What economic forces influence public pay and employment?
In spite of wide recognition of the importance of the public sector as
an employer of labor, these questions pertaining to the responsiveness of the

wage and employment of government workers have been rarely addressed. The
purpose of this paper is to set out the basic "facts" about public sector wage

and employment patterns in the U.S. and to develop a relatively simple
empirical model of public sector wage and employment setting which answers the
questions of concern.

The principle findings of the paper are:

(1) The pay of public sector workers relative to private sector
workers varies greatly over time. Contrary to the view that public sector pay
is inflexible, variations in relative pay are due as rruch to fluctuations in
public pay as to fluctuations in private pay.

(2)

The relatively high paid public sector worker of the early l9TOs

has within the span of a decade lost much of his or her advantage over
otherwise comparable private sector workers, seriously denting if not destroying
the picture of the 'overpaid' public employee which developed in the early
l9TOs.

The group of public sector workers who tend to be most highly paid in

the U.S. relative to private sector workers are blacks and women, suggesting
that the public sector has a better equal employment/affirmative action record
than does the private sector.

federal employees to be higher paid than private employees and Bureau of Labor

Statistics surveys of wage rates in particular occupations showing federal
workers to be lower paid.

(1) Public sector employment follows a very different pattern of
change than private sector employment. There is less annual variation in public

sector than in private sector employment. The rate of growth of state and local
employment tends to be countercyclical rather than cyclical while federal
employment growth tends to be less procyclic or countercyclical than private
employment growth. In terms of demographic composition the public sector
employs

the

relatively more

blacks and women than the private sector, reinforcing

belief that the government offers their workers better Job opportunities

than the private sector.

Budgets are, not surprisingly, a major determinant of state and

local public sector wage and employment. At the state and local level an
increase in the ratio of budgets to GNP raises relative employment by much more

than it raises relative wages. Because of differences in the response of the
public sector and private sector to broad economic developments, public sector

emplment rises relatively in recessions and falls relatively in booms while
relatIve

wages ve In

the opposite direction. Relative state and local public

sector employment tends, moreover, to fall in periods of rapid inflation. By
contrast, federal wage and employment, which constitute only a small proportion
of budgets and which can be financed by deficit financing, do not exhibit a
well—defined relationship to various measures of budget size.

Changing Patterns of Pay

The principal phenomenon of concern to this study — changes in the
relative pay of public sector workers —

is

depicted graphically in Figure 1.

This figure shows that the ratio of total compensation of public sector workers
relative to private sector workers in the National Income and Product Accounts
(NIPA) has varied greatly in recent decades and in the Depression and World War

II. During the Depression nominal public pay reiiined roughly constant while
private nominal pay fell, producing a substantial public pay advantage. During
World War II, private pay rose rapidly, lowering the piblic:private differen-

tial. From roughly the mid—1950s to the 1960s, public sector pay rose relative
to private sector pay, while beginning in the mid l9TOs relative public sector
pay fell.

The changes
largely

from

in relative pay

shown in the figure could have resulted

movements in private pay or largely from movements in public pay or

from roughly equal movements in the two series. The notion that public pay is

relative to private pay implies that it is rvements of the latter
that underly the changes in the figure.
To test this notion I have decomposed the relative pay measures in
"inflexible"

several ways

using

variants of the basic variance decomposition formula:

The variants of the decomposition formula that I use are:

decomposition of the ratio of real wages; (2) decomposition of the level of real
wages after removing a linear trend term; (3) decomposition of

changes in

money wages; (14) decomposition after an auto—regressive adjustment of' the

underlying series.

The results of the exercise (summarized in Appendix Table A) show that
public sector pay varies over time imre or less as much as private sector pay,
so that the notion of relatively inflexible public sector pay does not stand up
to

scrutiny. The changes in the ratio of public to private sector pay in Figure
are due roughly as much to variations in the former as to variations in the

latter.

Hence, by 1983 relative government pay seemed roughly to be at its post—1950
average.

The figures in columns 3 and 14 treat government enterprises. In the

federal government this includes the Post Office, Tennessee Valley Authority,
and

related organizations. For the state and local governments, it includes

public utilities and the like. A different pattern emerges in these data: a
rise in the ratio of federal enterprise to private sector pay contrasted with a
decline in the ratio of state and local enterprise to private sector pay.
Finally, column 5

treats

education, where we find a decline of 10 points from

1910 to 1982 followed by an increase of .03 from 1982 to 1983.

The disparate patterns suggest the value of re disaggregate look at
various publicly employed groups distinguished by function, level of government
and occupation, to which we turn next.

Table 2 records data from the government employment and payroll survey

of the Bureau of the Census. It shows a sharp decline in the pay of federal
workers under the general schedule (GS) system (which covers federal white
collar woiters) which is roughly consistent with the NIPA figures, but a
somewhat more complex pattern of change for workers paid under the WS system

(blue collar) and for postal (Ps) employees. In these cases relative wages turn

also a partial recovery for both education and other municipal workers in the

1972

Increases in the

average GS level of federal employees explain the change in salary above the

amount. As Appendix Table B shows these increases were concentrated

in the latter part of the seventies and rly

1980s. From 1977

to 1982 grade

increases (plus a minor "step creep", defined as increases in pay due to changes
in the "steps" of workers within a GS—level) raised pay by 9.0% compared to an
increase

in pay due to grade increases of 3.14% from 1912 to 1977. Had the

federal government not upgraded the GS—level of its work force — which could

represent a "true" increase in skill level, or a "creep" up in response to
market conditions —— the 1982 ratio of federal GS pay

to

private sector pay in

column 1 would have been 1.19. This implies that federal GS—pay

fell by 25 per-

centage points relative to private sector pay, grade held constant.
Rates of Pay for Comparable Workers

The comparisons of public and private pay thus far are crude, in that
they do not compare workers in the same occupation or with the same skills.
There are two basic ways to xr.ke such more refined calculations:

(1) to use

12

occupational

wage rates on the pay in detailed occupations; (2) to use mdlvi-

dual level data on the pay of workers with similar personal characteristics.
The former method contrasts wage rates actually used in wage—setting; the latter
method contrasts earnings

Which is "better" depends on the quality of data and pur-

pose of the comparison.

Table 3 uses federal professional, administrative, technical and
clerical (PATC) Survey Data to make such comparisons for white collar workers
The PATC survey provides information on average annual wages for occupations in
the private sector comparable to those in the public sector for each grade of

the general schedule (white collar workers) of the civil service. According to
the principle of federal pay in the Federal Pay Comparability Act of l9TO
adjustments in general schedule salaries are supposed to ensure that October

When recommending actual wage increases to Congress, however, the

President can suggest wage

changes not based on the PATC and of course Congress

can enact higher or lower pay increases. Each year

has recommended lower increases.

Note: For comparability over time the figures report unweighted averages of
occupational ratios only for occupations reporting in 1972 and in all later
years. The pattern for other occupations included in later surveys is consistent with that in the table. I have left out GS—3 because there were no
occupations in 1972 and GS—6 because only one occupation reported in 1972.

comparable pay increases and of resultant Congressional action in the l9TOs has
been to reduce relative federal pay

in all GS—levels, with an

unweighted average decline of 23 percentage points!

Table 4 records the results of similar comparisons for clerical and
skilled

maintenance workers for the federal governint; for clerical and skilled

firefighters,
police and teachers. At the federal level, we see the drop in relative pay for
maintenance workers in nunicipal

government employment; and of

clerical workers but not for skilled maintenance workers. At the municipal
level

we see sharp drops for all occupations, with police and firefighters

experiencing surprisingly large declines nearly as great as those for teachers.
All told, these comparisons of workers

in given occupations suggests

that the drop in public/private pay indicated in Tables 1 and 2 may underesti-

mate the fall in public sector pay, particularly for employees of local governments.

Current Population Survey

An alternative widely used way to compare workers with similar attri-

butes is to use data on individuals from the Current Population Survey tapes.
These tapes provide detailed information on personal characteristics of workers
but less adequate information on occupation and, in

some

cases, on

type

of

employer. The CPS tapes contain two questions on public sector employment: a
class of worker question which divides workers between private employment, self

between CPS—based data and the other data sets examined in this study becorno:

striking, indeed. In general, the CPS—based data show sms.ller relative declines
in public sector pay than do the payroll (NIPA) and occupation—based data and

higher public to private ratios of relative pay, whereas the levels of relative

differ significantly in some cases. In particular, in the PATC and

other detaIled Job surveys we found federal GS workers paid

less

than other

workers, in the CPS we find workers in federal public administration earning
more

than

the typical private sector worker in the same occupation, with

the sane personal characteristics.

There

are two basic reasons for this inconsistency. First, in

contrast to the CPS

which gathers data on all workers, the

limited to workers in relatively large firms, whose pay

Whether

or PATC corn—

parisons "better" is a matter of Judgernent. Some (Wachter and Perloff) have
interpreted comparability as calling for comparisons of federal employees with

all workers. Others argue that it

is wrong to compare employees of

the largest

single enterprise In the U.S. to workers from Joe's corner store (Hartman),
making the PATC comparison a more accurate picture of 'where

the federal

government stands in labor markets. Second is the difference betieen
comparisons of wages

in

well—defined jobs and of wages of persons with simihtr

demographic characteristics. Here, the PATC data has a clear advantage, a it

to specific occupations (computer programmer, accountant) for which the

federal government hires persons rather than of broadly defined groups

(professionals, with college education, of a given age) nrst of whom may lack

Changing Patterns of Employment

It is veil known that in the post—World War II period public sector
employment has risen relative to private sector employment. In 1950 15.6% of
full—tine equivalent workers were governnnt employees; In 1983 19.0% of full—
time equivalent workers were government employees.
In this section I examine the pattern of change in this employment
over the cycle,

by level of government and type of workers. The evidence

shows public sector employment not only to be less variable over time than private sector employment but also to exhibit a strikingly different pattern of

change over the business cycle. In addition the puhlic sector employs relatively more blacks and women than the private sector, which in conjunction with
relatively higher pay shown in Table 6,

suggests greater

public sector demand

for those workers.

Figure 2 depicts the ratios of federal civilian to private employment
and of state and local to private employment from 1950 to 1983, as given in the

NIPA data set. With respect to state and local employment, the data show a
marked rise until the mid—1970s, followed by a relatively sharp decline.
Indeed, from 1981 to 1983 state and local employment actually fell, partly an a
result

of

reductions in CETA employment, and partly as a result of declines in

education due to changes in the size of the school age population. At the

federal level, the employment share follows a very different pattern: from the
early l950s to the late l960s it is roughly constant at 3.8

of log changes in employment annually for the public and private sectors; over
the period 1955 — 1982 (leaving out the Korean War episode). Such a calculation

confirms the widely held belief that public sector employment is less variable
over time

than

private sector employment, with the following calculated standard

deviations: private non agricultural employment (.026); federal civilian

employment (.020) state and local employment (.0i7). Second I examined changes
in employment over NBER business cycles. As Table 7 shows, there is a striking
difference in cyclical changes in employment between sectors, particularly

Sex and Race

Our earlier

analysis found that pay differentials by sex and race were

smaller in public than in private employment. What about patterns of
employment?

Table 8 records the race and sex distribution of private and public

employment in 1978 and

1983.

It shows that governments tend to hire

proportionally xre blacks and women

than

does the private sector, though with

noticeable variation among levels of growth. In the 1978—1983 period, the

proportion of blacks in government relative to the proportion of blacks in the
private sector rose while the proportion of women in government increased above
the 50% rate.
Budgets and Macro Determinants of Public Sector Wage and Employment Changes

Preceding

sections have shown that far from being inflexible or

rigid, public sector wages have changed substantially relative to private sector wages

over time, and that the growth of public sector employment varies over

time.

In this section I examine the hypothesis that the public sector,

economic conditions and

to the discipline of the market." I shall take as given budgets or

tax rates, although In a complete model they are certainly endogenous, and examine how short—term variations in these factors influence relative public sector
wages and employment in the same 'way that one might examine how short-term

variations in industry output and prices (value added, productivity, profits)
affect private wages and employment.

Because of the very different way in

which their decisions are likely to be affected t,r budgets, such an analysis

must distinguish between federal and state or local governments. State and
local

governments

face, in general, hard budget constraints, whereas the federal

government can run continual deficits to fund its outlays. There is a serious
budget constraint in the one case, but not in the other, which we expect to
produce

differential employment and wage responses to b.idgetaiy changes.

To begin, Table 9 presents readily available figures on payrolls and

budgets in the l9TOs, designed to provide a crude indication of the extent to
which governments faced budget "crunches" in the period.

At the federal level outlays as a share of GNP rose sharply in the
period

covered, without a compensating increase in taxes, producing a sizeable

deficit. Despite increases in outlays, however, the ratio of federal compensation to GNP fell, indicative of a sizeable decline in the payroll share of

budgets. As lines 2a — d in Table 9 show, the only budget figures against which

private sector payrolls). However, the share of payroll in budgets has been
relatively fixed over time, Here, the problem with a simple "budget crunch"
story of employment and pay changes are the surpluses run. Payrolls could have
been increased by nearly 15% had the 1983 surplus been spent on pay rolls and by

14% had the payroll share of receipts been constant at its 19T0 level.
What the figures in Table 9

suggest

is that crude budget pressures on

public sector payrolls are not enough to explain the observed patterns of change
in public sector payrolls and thus in compensation and employment. The budget

"constraint" is not hard enough to be the sole factor at work.
A Small Regression Model: State and Local Governments

As a final step in evaluating the pattern of change over time In
public

sector wages and employment I have estimated the effect of budgets and

selected macro—economic variables on

relative public sector

wages and

employment. More specifically, I have regressed the ratio of compensation

and

employment in various parts of the public sector on the ratio of the relevant
budget to GNP, the rate of inflation in the GNP deflator, and the level of
unemployment.

The budget/GNP ratio is expected to be the key determinant of' relative
employment and wages, with the relative magnitude of

interest.

the coefficients of

Inflation is expected to reduce relative public sector pay due' to the

likely slower response of public 'wages to inflation while unemployment is
expected to raise

relative

state and local employment due to the observed eounter—

cyclical ivement of public sector employment.

Table 10 presents the results for state and local governments and

clear in the results, with a

ratio

to 1. The macro—economic factors affect relative pay and

in the expected manner, suggesting that the drop in public sector pay

relative to private sector pay in the l9TOs was at least facilitated by inflation and that the weak macro—labor market of the period marked an even greater

slowdown in relative public sector employment than is indicated in Figure 2.
Somewhat surprisingly the figures also show some effect of unemployment on

wages, with the level and ratio of public to private pay falling with high
unemployment. Less the results in Panel A be misinterpreted as resulting from

"inflexible" public sector factors relative to flexible private sector factors,
I report In Panel B calculations focused on the level of the public sector
variables themselves. As can be seen, these calculations shov the variability
and responsiveness of public sector employment

Several studies of public sector employment have taken wages as exoge-

(Ehrenberg, Heiney, Ashenfelter and Ehrenberg, for example) and examined the

elasticity of the employment response to wages. While the process of public sector

Conclusion

The principal result of this paper is that public sector relative
wages and employment changes substantially in both the short and long run,
apparently

in response to changes in broad

economic factors and to the financial

status of the various governments. The seventies were a period of relative
decline in public pay, of significant magnitudes at the level of specific occu—

has

highlighted the divergent picture one gets of the magnitude of public sector

pay

relative

to private sector pay dependent on whether one controls for broad

human capital or for specific occupations, but

also

finds that nearly all data

show the same pattern of change over time. It has documented the countercyclical pattern of public sector employment and shown that variation over time
at the state and local level follows reasonable patterns with respect to budgets

and macro—economic variables. While the paper leaves open the appropriate model
with which we should address these response patterns, it has provided a clear

answer to the question posed. Yes, public sector wages and employment re$pond
to economic conditions.

Appendix A
To evaluate the relative contribution of variation in government and
private pay to the observed change in the ratio of pay, we calculated the standard deviations of variation of each component separately, using four different
forms:
(1)

variation in levels of log pay

As can be seen, the variation In government pay exceeds that in pri—
vate pay

in

lines 2 and 3 but is less than that in private pay in lines 1 and 4•

Since the results depend on the particular

computation, we conclude that public

sector pay Is not noticeably less variable than private sector pay. Changes in

the private sector denominator do no drive changes in relative public sector
pay.

Appendix

B: Calculation of Relative Contributions of Scheduled Increases,

Increases due to "Grade Creep" and to "Step Creep" in the GS—pay Schedule

There are eighteen grades and ten steps in the GS schedule. Grades are

for promotion, steps are for longevity and merit pay increases. In addition,
longevity increases above step ten are possible. (These additional increases
cause some additional calculations below.)
The re1tive c,-ntriTh,tirrnq rift
-- the

re ce1ulated a

nffinnnnts

follows:
Scheduled Increases

A. The average annual

salary

for the initial year

was calculated by

taking actual salaries [avsail.
B.

The increase attributable to changes in the pay

lated by first

year

schedule

was calcu-

employment by- grade and sex to calculate a weighted average

of the final year pay

structure.

Since

the number of workers above step 10

changes between years, this calculation required adjustment of the final year
wage schedule to reflect the number of persons above step ten in the first year

1acin.
C. Increase in average wage attributable to step and pay

increases,

was

calculated by taking first year employment by grade to calculate a weighted

average of final year average wage by grade. This reflects both the increase in
average step and the increase/decrease in the number of

persons above step 10

iavslstepl.
D. Increase in average

wage attributable to step, pay, and grade

increase was calculated by taking the average wge [avsall in the final year.
Thus:
