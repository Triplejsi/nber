Estimating Turning Points Using Large Data Sets
James H. Stock and Mark W. Watson
NBER Working Paper No. 16532
November 2010
JEL No. C32,E32
ABSTRACT
Dating business cycles entails ascertaining economy-wide turning points. Broadly speaking, there
are two approaches in the literature. The first approach, which dates to Burns and Mitchell (1946),
is to identify turning points individually in a large number of series, then to look for a common date
that could be called an aggregate turning point. The second approach, which has been the focus of
more recent academic and applied work, is to look for turning points in a few, or just one, aggregate.
This paper examines these two approaches to the identification of turning points. We provide a nonparametric
definition of a turning point (an estimand) based on a population of time series. This leads to estimators
of turning points, sampling distributions, and standard errors for turning points based on a sample
of series. We consider both simple random sampling and stratified sampling. The empirical part of
the analysis is based on a data set of 270 disaggregated monthly real economic time series for the U.S.,
1959-2010.

1. Introduction
The determination of business cycle turning points is a classic problem in
economic statistics. Many of our basic notions of the lead-lag relations among
macroeconomic time series are informed by traditional methods of dating turning points
for individual series and comparing them to turning points of the overall economy.
Chronologies of business cycle turning points (in the jargon, reference cycle
chronologies) are currently maintained in the United States by the NBER Business Cycle
Dating Committee, in Europe by the CEPR, and by similar organizations in other
countries.
This paper compares two approaches to dating business cycles. The dominant
current approach, both in the academic literature and in the real-time practice of dating
committees, is to date reference cycles by focusing on one, or a few, highly aggregated
time series. Hamilton (2010) surveys the academic literature on identifying peaks (dating
and predicting recessions). All the methods he discusses define recessions or turning
points in terms of single highly aggregated series such as GDP or a monthly index of
coincident indicators. Press releases of the NBER Business Cycle Dating Committee
indicate that its current practice is to focus on a few highly aggregated series; for
example, the press release announcing the 2007:12 peak (NBER (2008)) gives greatest
weight to three aggregates (establishment employment, GDP, and GDI), gives secondary
weight to five more aggregates (industrial production, household employment, real
manufacturing and trade sales, real personal income less transfers, and monthly
consumption), and mentions no other series. We will use the term “average then date” to

2

describe the dating of reference cycles using a single highly aggregated series, such as
GDP.
As Harding and Pagan (2006) point out, this average-then-date approach contrasts
with the approach of the pioneers of business cycle dating, who considered a large
number of disparate disaggregated series, identified turning points in those disaggregated
series, then determined reference cycle turning points based on the distribution of the
turning points of the disaggregated series; see Burns and Mitchell (1946, p. 13 and pp.
77-80). We refer to this latter approach as “date then average.”
This paper makes five contributions to the literature on dating reference cycles.
The first is to specify a nonparametric estimand which constitutes a population definition
of a turning point. The estimand we focus on is the local mode of the population
distribution of turning points of disaggregated coincident economic indicators, although
we consider other local measures of central tendency as well.1 This nonparametric
population definition of an estimand contrasts with methods in which turning points are
1

An alternative would be to consider the mode if a clear mode exists or, if not, the end of

a plateau in the population distribution of turning points. This alternative is consistent
with Burns and Mitchell (1946, pp. 77-80): “In many cases the turning points of different
series were bunched so closely that we could not go far astray. But there were cases in
which the turning points were widely scattered, and others in which they were
concentrated around two separate dates. If there was little else to guide us, we placed the
reference turn toward the close of the transition period.” It is not clear how to formulate
this “close of transition period” scheme mathematically so we restrict attention to local
measures of central tendency, with primary focus on the mode. See Harding and Pagan
(2006, Section 4) for additional discussion of the role of clusters in Burns and Mitchell
(1946).

defined within a parametric model (e.g. Hamilton (1989)), are defined by an algorithm
applied to a realization of series (e.g. Harding and Pagan (2006), in which a turning point
is a sample, not population, concept), or are based on expert judgment. Second, with an
estimand in hand we undertake statistical inference for date-then-average business cycle
turning points. For example, we use asymptotic theory for the kernel estimator of the
mode to compute confidence intervals for reference cycle dates estimated from turning
points of a random sample of disaggregated series. Third, in the data set we use, some
series are available for only a subset of the period and the series are sampled such that
different high-level aggregates are not equally represented, and the possibility arises that
these departures from simple random sampling could introduce bias by overweighting
certain leading or lagging series. We therefore provide and implement methods for
adjusting for these sampling irregularities using a stratified sampling framework. Fourth,
the empirical work uses a large number of disaggregated series; specifically, the data set
consists of 270 monthly real economic activity indicators for the United States, 1959:1 –
2010:9, where the series are components of four categories of indicators: employment,
industrial production, personal income, or sales. Fifth, this paper also makes a
contribution to the average-then-date literature by considering chronologies based on
three new monthly measures of GDP developed in Stock and Watson (2010a): an
expenditure-based monthly GDP (MGDP-E), an income-based monthly GDP (MGDP-I),
and their geometric average (MGDP).
There is a fairly large literature on business cycle dating using modern time series
methods, recently surveyed by Hamilton (2010). The papers most closely related to this
one are Harding and Pagan (2006), Chauvet and Piger (2008), and Stock and Watson

4

(2010b). Harding and Pagan (2006) is the first modern paper we are aware of to attempt
to formulate the Burns and Mitchell (1946) approach of establishing reference cycle
turning points from turning points of multiple individual series. Chauvet and Piger
(2008) implement the Harding-Pagan (2006) approach in real time and compare it with
an average-then-date chronology based on a Hamilton (1989) Markov switching filter.
Both Harding and Pagan (2006) and Chauvet and Piger (2008) consider a small number
of series (four), and neither provide a statement of the estimand or standard errors. Stock
and Watson (2010b) present preliminary results on reference cycle turning points
estimated using the 270-series data set. Their turning points are computed as unadjusted
means of individual-series turning points; the results provided here improve upon Stock
and Watson (2010b) by estimating in addition the mode and the median and by adjusting
for data irregularities.
The date-then-average methods are described in Section 2 and the average-thedate methods are described in Section 3. The data set and the empirical results are
presented in Section 4, and Section 5 concludes.

2. Date-then-Average Methods for Reference Cycle Dating
We consider the problem of dating a reference cycle turning point (peak or
trough), conditional on the event that a single turning point occurred in a given episode
covering a known time span. This corresponds to a situation in which it is known that a
recession occurred during a particular time interval and all that remains is to date the
peak within this interval. Conditioning on an episode known to contain a peak or trough
is done as an analytical simplification. An extension of the methods here would be to

5

examine estimators that determine simultaneously whether there is a recession and the
date of the recession (as in the Harding-Pagan (2006) algorithm).
This section first describes date-then-average reference cycle dating with a simple
random sample of series. In our data set, sampling is better thought of as stratified
sampling with unequal weights and long periods of missing data, and we propose two
modifications of the methods for simple random sampling to handle these data
irregularities. Throughout this paper, turning points for individual series are calculated
using the Bry-Boschan (1971) algorithm.2
2.1 Dating Using a Simple Random Sample of Disaggregated Series
We imagine a population of economic time series, each of which measures a
different aspect of economic activity; we approximate this population as being infinitely
large. In general, a member of this population has turning points. Thus in a given
episode s, which covers a known time interval, there exists a population distribution of
dates of turning point of specific series in the population. Letting  denote the turning
point of an individual series, we denote this population distribution of turning points as
gs(). The estimand, that is, the reference cycle turning point, is defined as a functional
of this distribution. For reasons discussed in the introduction, we focus on the mode,
which we denote Dsmode , however we also consider the median ( Dsmed ) and the mean
( Dsmean ).
2

The first step of the Bry-Boschan algorithm entails a nearly-centered 15-month moving

average. We found that this occasionally produced some anomalous results, specifically
peaks lower than their counterpart troughs, and that these anomalies were eliminated by
using a centered 3-month moving average. The results reported in this paper therefore all
use the three-month moving average in the first Bry-Boschan setp.
6

The mean, median, and mode of the distribution gs can be estimated from a
sample of turning points, {is}, i = 1, … , ns where is is the turning point date of series i
in episode s and ns is the number of turning points observed in episode s. Let Dˆ smean ,
Dˆ smed , and Dˆ smode respectively denote the sample mean, median, and mode computed

using the sample {is}. We compute the mode as the mode of a kernel density estimator

gˆ s of gs, with kernel K and bandwidth h.
If the sample of series is obtained by simple random sampling from the
population of series then the turning points are i.i.d. and the asymptotic distributions of
the three estimators are,

where  2,s = var(is) in episode s. Result (3) for the estimator of the mode dates to Parzen
(1962), also see Romano (1988) and Ziegler (2003); for this result the bandwidth
sequence hn satisfies hn → 0, nhn3 → ∞. The variances in (1) – (3) are consistently
estimable using kernel estimators of gs and its second derivative, gs.
2.2 Adjusting for Weighted Random Sampling: Lag Adjustment

7

As is discussed in Section 4, in our data set components of industrial production
are more heavily represented than components of personal income, and the relative
number of components varies over time. If turning points in industrial production
systematically lead turning points in personal income then treating our sample of turning
points as a simple random sample will bias the estimator towards an estimated reference
cycle turning point that leads the population reference cycle turning point.
We model this problem of unequal representation of classes of series as one of
stratified sampling, in which the initial stratum is the class of series (such as industrial
production). The subaggregate (such as industrial production of primary metals) is then
randomly sampled within the class. The number of observations (series) differs from one
class to the next. This results in some classes of series receiving larger weight in the
sample than in the population. Bias arises if turning points in a class of series lead or lag
the population reference cycle turning point and if the sample and population weights
differ by series class.
We use two different procedures for adjusting for discrepancies between sample
and population weights by series class: lag adjustment and weighted estimation. Both
procedures involve weighting by the ratio of population to sample probabilities. Let m
index classes of series, let M be the number of classes (which we take to be finite), let mi
be the class containing series i, let m be the population probability assigned to class m,
and let pms be the fraction of series of class m in the sample of turning points for episode

s. Then the ratio wis of population weights to sample weights for series i in episode s is,

wis =

m

i

pmi s

.

(4)

8

Lag adjustment by class. The first procedure exploits the panel nature of the data
set by estimating a mean lag for each series. Let series in class m have a population mean
lag km, relative to the reference cycle date Then we can write the turning point of the ith
series in episode s as the sum of the population mean reference cycle turning point Dsmean ,
the mean lag for its class, and a discrepancy is:

is = Dsmean + km + is.

(5)

i

The reference cycle turning point is identified as the mean by assuming that Eis = 0 and
that km are normalized so that the mean lag in population is zero. This latter condition
corresponds to



M
m 1

 m km = 0.

The lag adjustment procedure has two steps. First, {km} in (5) are estimated by
restricted least squares, subject to the restriction that



M
m 1

 m km = 0; this yields the

estimators { kˆm }. Second, the sample of adjusted turning points is constructed as is = is
– kˆmi . The mean, median, and mode estimators are then computed episode-by-episode
using the lag-adjusted data, {is }.
2.3 Adjusting for Weighted Random Sampling: Weighted Estimation
The second procedure for adjusting for weighted random sampling involves
weighting the sample so that the sample weights on individual observations (that is,
series-specific turning points) match the population weights.

9

Let gms denote the distribution of turning points among series of class m in
episode s. The population distribution of turning points in episode s is then gs =



m

 m gms , where the sum is over the finitely many classes of series. Because the Bry-

Boschan algorithm produces integer-valued turning points, the raw data consist of
histograms of turning point dates for each class of series, by episode. The weighted
estimation schemes are all based on weighting these histograms of turning points by class
to yield a weighted histogram, where the weights are the ratio of the population to sample
weights. Specifically, the weighted histogram for episode s is gˆ shist  wtd (t ) =



ns
i 1

wis 1( is  t )



ns
i 1

wis . The weighted mean and median are computed directly from

the weighted histogram. The weighted mode is computed as the mode of the kernel
density estimator computed by smoothing gˆ shist  wtd .
Variances for the weighted mean and median estimators are,

where Gms is the cdf corresponding to gms.
Because the terms in the first summation in (7) are poorly estimated, standard
errors for the weighted median in the empirical work are computed using the bound in the
final expression in (7).

10

The variance of the weighted mode is that given in (3) for the mode under simple
random sampling, with the modification that gs is reinterpreted as the weighed density.
Standard errors for the mode of the weighted distribution are computed using the kernel
smoother of the weighted histogram to estimate gs.3

3. Average-then-Date Methods

Dating using aggregates entails identifying turning points (here, using the BryBoschan algorithm) in an aggregate measure of economic activity. We consider six such
measures. Three of these are indexes of coincident economic indicators, constructed as
weighted average of four monthly aggregates: industrial production (IP), nonfarm
employment (EMP), real manufacturing and wholesale-retail trade sales (MT), and real
personal income less transfers (PIX). The remaining three measures of aggregate activity
are monthly estimates of quarterly GDP. We use data on the aggregates series from
1959:1 – 2010:6.
3.1 Indexes of coincident economic indicators.

Let Xit denote one of the four series (IP, EMP, MT, and PIX) in native units in
period t, so i = 1,…, 4, and let yit = ln(Xit). We consider three indexes Ct constructed
from these series.
3

The idea of stratified sampling could be carried further than we do here by including

additional substrata. For example, below manufacturing and trade sales there exists an
industry stratum, e.g. durables manufacturing, nondurables manufacturing, etc. We have
assumed independence across turning points within our single-stratum sampling unit (e.g.
among components of manufacturing and trade sales). One could relax this by allowing
for clustering at a lower stratum. This extension to clustered standard errors is left to
future work.

computed using the estimated parameters, applied to yit computed using the
original data (not outlier-adjusted). The DFM coincident index is CtDFM =
exp( fˆt /T ) , which is then scaled to equal 100 in 2004:7.

Table 1 gives the weights for the three indexes. These indexes have quite
different implied weights. The ISD index puts nearly half the weight on employment and
very little on IP and MT. In contrast, the DFM index places over half the weight on IP
and very little on EMP. The weights for the TCB index are quite close to the inverse
standard deviation weights. It is important to note that one reason the chronologies based
on these different indexes differ is that by weighting the different series differently, the
indexes have different average growth rates and different standard deviations, which
leads to different periods of negative growth.
3.2 Monthly GDP

We also consider dates based on three monthly measures of real GDP.
Construction of these measures is described in Stock and Watson (2010a). Briefly, there
are two separate measures, an expenditure-based monthly GDP which, following
Nalewaik (2011) we refer to as GDP(E), and an income-based monthly GDP, which we
refer to as GDP(I). Nominal monthly GDP(E) is estimated as the sum of eight
components (consumption, investment - nonresidential structures, investment –
residential structures, investment – equipment and software, change in inventories,
exports, imports, and government purchases). Some of these are observed on a monthly
basis. For components that are only reported quarterly, the quarterly values are

13

distributed using a state space model in which the monthly concept is modeled as a latent
series that is correlated with observable monthly series chosen to be conceptually close to
the specific component. Real monthly GDP(E) is computed from the nominal series
using a monthly interpolation of the PCE price deflator. Nominal and real monthly
GDP(I) are computed analogously, using six components (employee compensation,
proprietors’ income, rental income, net interest, corporate profits, and other).
We also use an estimate of monthly GDP that combines the expenditure- and
income-based estimates. This combined series, GDP(Avg), is computed as the geometric
average of GDP(E) and GDP(I).

4. Empirical Results
4.1 The Disaggregated Data Set

The disaggregated data set consists of 270 components of industrial production
(69 distinct component series), nonfarm employment (95 series), real manufacturing and
wholesale-retail trade sales (92 series), and real personal income less transfers (14 series).
All data are monthly for the United States, with a maximum span of 1959:1 – 2010:9
(621 months). The series and the spans for which they are available are listed in
Appendix A.
The monthly growth rates of the 270 series, divided by their standard deviation, is
displayed as a heat chart in Figure 1. (Figures 1-3 are presented in gray scales as
supplemental Figures S-1, S-2, and S-3.) The vertical axis is series number as given in
Appendix A, the horizontal axis is time in months. Blue denotes periods of positive
growth, yellow denotes moderately negative growth, and red denotes strongly negative

14

growth. The rectangular gray swaths in Figure 1 represent missing data. The most
relevant features of Figure 1 for the current purpose are the vertical yellow-red bands.
Because the horizontal axis is calendar time, the vertical yellow-red bands show periods
in which many of the component series were experiencing negative growth.
The periods of negative growth are more apparent in Figure 2, which is an
enhanced version of Figure 1. Specifically, Figure 2 plots [–zit], where zit growth rate
of series i, divided by its standard deviation,  is the cumulative normal distribution
function., and  is a scale factor chosen to sharpen the image. The NBER-dated
postwar recessions clearly stand out as dark red vertical bands. From the perspective of
dating turning points, the beginning of each red band suggests a reference cycle peak and
the end of the band suggests a trough.
Figure 3 plots series-specific recession episodes, where a series-specific recession
is defined to be the period from a Bry-Boschan peak to a Bry-Boschan trough. The
NBER recessions remain clearly visible in Figure 3. It is evident that there is
considerable dispersion of specific-series turning points around the beginning and end of
the recessions. In addition, there are evidently many more or less random specific-series
recessions that do not align with recessions in other series.
As discussed above, our analysis focuses on dating turning points, conditional on
a turning point having occurred. Figures 1-3 suggest that the disaggregated series would
also be useful for ascertaining whether a turning point has occurred – that is, determining
the presence of a vertical band – but we do not pursue that. Henceforth, we focus on data
by episode, where an episode is defined to be the NBER turning point date  12 months.
4.2 Results: Reference Cycle Chronologies

15

We begin with reference cycle chronologies computed using the aggregate
monthly series, then turn to chronologies based on the distribution of turning points in the
disaggregated series.
Average-then-date chronologies. Figure 4 plots two of the monthly aggregate

series, the inverse standard deviation-weighted coincident index (CI-ISD) and the
combined monthly GDP series GDP(Avg). The vertical lines in Figure 4 represent the
reference cycle chronologies based on the plotted series and the NBER chronology. The
coincident index is more cyclically volatile than the monthly GDP series. One notable
difference between the two series is that monthly GDP plateaus during 2001 but the BryBoschan algorithm does not indicate a recession; this is not surprising because quarterly
(expenditure-based) GDP declines for only one quarter, and grows over every twoquarter period, during this episode. In most episodes, however, turning points based on
the two series coincide and also coincide with the NBER chronology.
The chronologies based on all six monthly aggregates (the three coincident
indexes and the three monthly GDP series) are summarized in Table 2, as leads or lags
relative to the NBER date. The coincident indexes produce the same turning points in 9
of the 16 cases, and are within a month of each other in all but 4 cases. Notably, the
DFM index, which puts considerable weight on industrial production, dates the 1969:12
and 1980:1 peaks earlier than the other coincident indexes, and the TCB index dates the
2001:11 trough four months later. Of these three indexes, the CI-ISD comes the closest
to matching the NBER chronology, with a mean absolute difference between its
chronology and the NBER chronology of 0.7 months; the only discrepancy between the
CI-ISD and NBER chronologies exceeding two months is the 2001:3 peak.

16

The monthly GDP(E) chronology differs substantially from the NBER
chronology and the coincident index chronologies: it dates 5 turning points earlier than
the corresponding NBER date, by as much as 10 months, and does not identify a
recession in 1980 or 20014. The GDP(I) chronology does not identify a recession in 1970
and dates the 2007:12 peak 12 months earlier, but otherwise is close to the NBER
chronology. The final column of the table displays the chronology for the
Macroeconomic Advisors monthly GDP series, which is available only since 1992:4.
Like GDP(E), this series does not detect a recession in 2001 and dates the 2007:12 peak 1
months later than the NBER.
Date-then-average chronologies. Table 3 reports three sets of date-then-average

chronologies based on the 270-series disaggregated data set, along with their standard
errors.5 The first set of chronologies, reported in the first three columns of results, are
unadjusted turning point estimates, for which the series are treated as if they resulted
from simple random sampling (Section 2.1). The next block of three columns reports
chronologies based on the weighted lag adjustment procedure described in Section 2.2,
with class-specific fixed effects as in (5).6 The final block of columns reports the results
of weighted estimation, computed following Section 2.3. The lag-adjusted and weighted
estimation methods require population weights 1,…, 4 for the four classes of series.
4

GDP(E) declined sharply in 1980, however the decline only lasted 5 months so it is not

identified as a recession by the Bry-Boschan algorithm.

The kernel density estimator fˆs was computed using the biweight kernel, K(z) =

(15/16)(1 – z2)2, for which
6

  K '( z )

dz = 2.1429, with bandwidth h = 4 months.

The class-specific estimated lags (km in the notation of (5)) are -0.82 for IP, 2.65 for

EMP, -1.12 for MT, and -2.01 for PIX.
17

The results in Table 3 use population weights of 0.3 for IP, EMP, and MT, and 0.1 for
PIX. This choice of unequal weights was made for the practical reason that in some
episodes there are very few (as few as 2) PIX subaggregate turning points so the
weighting scheme of Section 2.3 results in those series getting very large weights and
produces some outliers. The large weights and outliers call into question the validity of
the asymptotic standard errors. Results based on equal population weights for the four
classes are discussed below as a sensitivity check.
The date-then-average chronologies in Table 3 have three noteworthy features.
First, the standard errors of the estimated turning points are fairly small, in most cases in
the range 0.5 to 0.8, so that a typical confidence interval for a turning point is 1 to 1.6
months. The standard errors tend to be larger for earlier episodes, which is consistent
with the number of series increasing over the course of the sample.
Second, even though the sample does not have equal representation of the classes
of series, using the adjusted methods (lag adjustment and weighted estimation) makes
surprisingly little difference to the estimated chronology. For example, the greatest
difference between the mode chronology using no adjustments, compared with the
weighted mode, is 0.5 months.
Third, the mean, median, and mode estimates typically agree rather closely when
computed using the same adjustment procedure (unadjusted, lag-adjusted, or weighted),
although there are several episodes in which the three estimators differ by up to two
months. In this sense, choice of estimand matters for the resulting chronology, at least in
some episodes.

18

Fourth, in most episodes the date-then-average chronologies are very close to the
NBER chronology, but there are a few episodes with notable differences. For example,
the weighted mode chronology differs from the NBER chronology by less than one
month in 12 of the 16 episodes. However, all the date-then-average chronologies date the
1969:12 and 2001:3 peaks earlier than the NBER., and for these peaks the difference
between the date-then-average turning point and the NBER turning point is statistically
significant at the 5% level for nearly all estimators in the table.
Sensitivity analysis. We briefly discuss two other sets of results as sensitivity

checks. First, Table 2 was also computed using equal population weights, that is, 1 = …
= 4 = 0.25. This affects only the second two blocks of results (lag-adjusted and
weighted estimation). Using equal population weights produced changes for the class-lag
adjusted estimates of typically 0.1 months or less. The weighted mean and median
chronologies changed somewhat more, but still by less than 0.5 months. The only
substantial change was two dates for the weighted mode, for which the equal weighting
scheme produced highly influential outliers.
Second, we also computed lag-adjusted chronologies using series-specific lags
instead of class lags, so that (5) has series-specific lags instead of class-specific lags. For
most episodes the results using series-specific lags are similar to the results in Table 2,
but for some episodes they differ from the Table 2 results and the series-specific lag
adjusted mean, median, and mode also differ from each other. Overall, the resulting
chronologies are outliers, relative to those in Table 2 (including the NBER chronology).
We view this as a result of limitations of the data. In our unbalanced panel there are
many series that appear in only a few episodes, so series-specific lags are in many cases

19

poorly estimated. Some results based on the counterpart of (5) using series-specific lags,
but without weighting (and thus not addressing the bias problem) are presented in Stock
and Watson (2010b).
Third, we recomputed the estimates in Table 3 using a wider episode band of 15
months on each side of the NBER date instead of 12 months. (At the time of writing,
fewer than 15 months of data are available since the 2009:6 trough so we excluded that
trough from this sensitivity check.) The sensitivity of the results to the width of the
episode depends on the estimator: the mean is the most sensitive, followed by the
median, and the mode is the least sensitive. For example, the weighted mean estimate of
the 2001:11 trough, relative to the NBER date, changes from +0.6 months using a 12month episode band to +2.0 months using a 15-month episode band, whereas the
weighted mode only changed from +0.6 months to +0.7 months. This robustness of the
mode, and lack of robustness of the mean, to the episode width is not surprising, and this
robustness is another virtue of the mode as a turning point estimator.
4.3 Four Episodes: 1969:12, 1991:3, 2001:3, and 2007:12

We now take a closer look at four episodes in which there is disagreement among
the methods examined in Tables 2 and 3.
The 1969:12 peak. The date-then-average methods in Table 3 all date the

1969:12 NBER peak as having occurred between 1.3 and 2.4 months earlier, so that (after
rounding) the peak would be 1969:10. Of the average-then-date methods in Table 2, the
TCB and ISD chronologies also date 1969:10, whereas the DFM, GDP(E), and
GDP(Avg) chronologies place the peak in 1969:8. The GDP(I) series does not detect a
Bry-Boschan recession in 1969-70.

20

Figure 5a plots the weighted histogram and kernel density estimate of peak
turning point dates in the 1969:12 episode, and Figure 5b plots two monthly aggregates
over this episode, monthly GDP(Avg) and the inverse standard deviation-weighted
coincident index. The weighted mode of 1969:10 is clearly visible in the kernel density
plot and in the weighted histogram. The 1969:8 turning point in GDP(Avg) is due to a
local peak that is slightly higher than the 1969:10 local peak. August 1969 is not a local
mode in Figure 5a in either the histogram or the kernel density estimate, nor does it
constitute an end-of-transition-period date (rather it is near the beginning of the cluster of
turning points from 1969:7 to 1969:12. The date-then-average evidence is consistent
with the average-then-date evidence that the peak occurred earlier than 1969:12. Of the
two dates suggested by the average-then-date chronologies, the date-then-average
evidence points to the later one, October 1969.
The 1991:3 trough. This episode is interesting because the date-then-average

trough estimates based on the means in Table 3 are approximately 2 months later than the
median and mode estimates. Moreover, the median and mode estimates are close to the
average-then-date troughs, which in all cases except GDP(I) and GDP(Avg) coincide
with the NBER trough. The reason for the divergent mean estimate is evident in Figure
6a. That figure shows two clusters of turning points, the main cluster from 1990:12 to
1991:7, and a smaller cluster in early 1992. The mode and median are in the first cluster
which aligns with the average-then-date and NBER chronologies. The mean averages in
observations in the second, later cluster and thus produces an estimate that lags the
others. The discussion in Burns and Mitchell (1946) cited above is consistent with
selecting a turning point in the first cluster, which has a distinct mode. The 95%

21

confidence interval for the trough based on the unweighted mode is (1991:2.8, 1991:4.6),
which contains 1991:3. In this instance, then, the date-then-average analysis confirms the
average-then-date and NBER trough date of 1991:3. This discussion underscores that the
mode is preferable to the mean because of the sensitivity of the mean to outliers (distant
local turning points for a relatively small number of series).
The 2001:3 peak. The 2001:3 peak shows considerable date disagreements. The

average-then-date estimates based on coincident indexes all estimate 2000:9, the GDP(I)
estimate is 2001:3, and the GDP(E) and GDP(Avg) methods do not detect a recession.
The date-then average estimates range from 2000:10.2  1.2 to 2000:12.8  0.6. The
weighted mode estimate is 2000:12.7 with a very wide standard error.
Inspection of Figure 7a shows two clusters of turning points, one in the summer
through early fall of 2000 and the second in 2000:12 – 2001:3, and the kernel density
estimate is bimodal. The ISD index is essentially flat from 2000:9-2001:3, with a slight
local peak in 2000:9, and monthly GDP(Avg) is increasing with only minor fluctuations
over this period and into the summer of 2001. Two interpretations of the Burns-Mitchell
method seem possible in this circumstance. The first would be to select the end of this
long flat episode, which would accord with the NBER date of 2001:3. This estimate is
later than any of those in Table 3 because Table 3 does not consider end-of-episode
dating. However, an end-of-episode dating rule would lag the NBER dates: the end-ofepisode dates in the three cases considered here postdate the weighted mode, which on
average lags the NBER chronology by only 0.13 months. The second interpretation,
which is the approach we have adopted in this paper, would choose the mode of the
second cluster, which (with a large spike in the histogram) is 2000:12.

22

The 2007:12 peak. Aside from monthly GDI, the average-then-date chronologies

all estimate the 2007:12 peak to be within a month of the NBER date. In contrast, the
weighted mode estimator places the 2007:12 peak six months earlier than the NBER date,
with a tight standard error (1.1). Inspection of the histogram and weighted kernel density
estimate for this episode, shown in Figure 8, reveals however that this episode has an
interesting pattern of turning points of the disaggregated series. The episode has a long
period (approximately 12 months) over which many series turn, and the kernel density
estimator has two modes, the higher one being 6 months before the NBER date and a
slightly lower one two months after. Thus inspection of the histogram and weighted
density estimate suggests that in this episode Burns and Mitchell’s (1946) “close of
transition period” rule might apply, which would place the turning point a month or two
after the NBER peak. We do not have a mathematical implementation for the close-oftransition-period concept so we cannot provide a more precise estimate for the 2007:12
peak, or a standard error, based on that approach, however that concept does suggest
placing substantially less weight on the weighted mode estimator at this turning points
than at the other turning points.

5. Discussion

The empirical results in Section 4 suggest that the date-then-average procedures,
including the new confidence intervals for reference cycle turning points, have the
potential to provide useful information to supplement the process of determining
reference cycle chronologies. The modal turning point is closely related to the approach
used by Burns and Mitchell (1946) and the early NBER researchers. In addition to this

23

historical link, the use of the mode seems to be preferable empirically to the mean
because the mean is sensitive to outliers as was noted in the discussion of the 1991:3
trough.
The exercise here focuses on subaggregates within only four classes of series.
Arguably more classes should be considered, indeed the early NBER researchers
considered a much broader set of series than these four. For example, the importance of
GDP as a measure of output suggests extending this analysis to include monthly
subaggregates of GDP when available.
While we have been able to produce standard errors for the date-then-average
chronologies, no such standard errors exist for the average-then-date chronologies.
Developing a frequentist distribution theory for Bry-Boschan turning points of a single
aggregate time series remains an intriguing research problem.

Notes: Weights for the TCB index were estimated by a regression of the change in the
index on the change in the four components (R2 = 0.97). Weights for the dynamic factor
model (DFM) coincident index are the sum of the steady-state Kalman smoother weights
on current, lead, and lagged values of the row series.

Notes: Entries are the NBER turning point minus the series-specific Bry-Boschan
turning point, in months. Episodes for which the series is available but does not have a
Bry-Boschan turning point are denoted by “–”. The GDP(E), GDP(I), and GDP(Avg)
monthly GDP series are from Stock and Watson (2010a). The GDP-MA series is the
Macroeconomic Advisors Monthly GDP series, which starts in 1992:4. The mean and
mean absolute error (MAE) in the final two rows summarize the discrepancies of the
chronology for the column series, relative to the NBER chronology; episodes in which a
series does not have a Bry-Boschan recession are excluded from the summary statistics.

Notes: Entries are the NBER turning point minus the date-then-average chronology for
that column, in months. Standard errors appear in parentheses. The mean and mean
absolute error (MAE) in the final two rows summarize the discrepancies of the
chronology for the column series, relative to the NBER chronology.

the 270 series in the monthly data set. The vertical axis is the series number as given in
Appendix A; the horizontal axis is the monthly time scale, 1959:1-2010:9. Negative
monthly growth appears as red, positive monthly growth rates appear as blue. The gray
sections indicate missing data.
