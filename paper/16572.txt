ABSTRACT
We measure and examine data error in health, education and income statistics used to construct the
Human Development Index. We identify three sources of data error which are due to (i) data updating,
(ii) formula revisions and (iii) thresholds to classify a country’s development status. We propose a
simple statistical framework to calculate country specific measures of data uncertainty and investigate
how data error biases rank assignments. We find that up to 34% of countries are misclassified and,
by replicating prior studies, we show that key estimated parameters vary by up to 100% due to data
error.

Classification, Detection and Consequences of Data Error:
Evidence from the Human Development Index*
Hendrik Wolff, Howard Chong and Maximilian Auffhammer
We measure and examine data error in health, education and income statistics used to construct
the Human Development Index. We identify three sources of data error which are due to (i) data
updating, (ii) formula revisions and (iii) thresholds to classify a country‘s development status.
We propose a simple statistical framework to calculate country specific measures of data
uncertainty and investigate how data error biases rank assignments. We find that up to 34% of
countries are misclassified and, by replicating prior studies, we show that key estimated
parameters vary by up to 100% due to data error.
‘Perhaps the greatest step forward that can be taken, even at short notice, is to insist that
economic statistics be only published together with an estimate of their error.’
Oskar Morgenstern, 1970
1. Introduction and Related Literature
This paper studies the Human Development Index (HDI), which has become one of the
most widely used measures to communicate a country‘s development status. Compared to the
Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the HDI is a broader measure of development, since it captures
not only the level of income, but also incorporates measures of health and education (Srinivasan,
1994; Streeten, 1994; Anand and Sen, 2000). The United Nations Development Programme,
which releases the HDI statistics, classifies each country into one of three categories: ‗low
human development‘ for HDI scores between 0.0 and 0.5, ‗medium human development‘ for
scores between 0.5 and 0.8 and ‗high human development‘ for scores between 0.8 and 1.0.

Although these development categories were not originally designed to determine
international relations, development aid or should imply any other legal consequences, today
these three mutually exclusive categories are used in politics, academia, and the corporate world.
In business relations, the categories have been used for international pricing purposes (Bate and
Boateng, 2007). Since 2001 the pharmaceutical company Merck sells drugs at different prices
with up to 90% discounts for countries that are classified as ‘low’, and 75% reductions for
‘medium’ countries (Petersen and Rother, 2001). Second, the HDI has been widely used in
debates among development researchers and policy makers (Sen, 2000) and is actively invoked
to structure discussions in development-political debates of both governmental and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) (Jahan, 2000; HDR, 1990 to 2006). For allocation of
development aid, it is known that the government of Ireland puts a particular focus on countries
categorized as ‘low human development’ (O’Neill, 2005). International climate accord designs
following the expiring Kyoto Agreement have included a proposal for linking countries’
abatement responsibilities according to their HDI (Hu, 2009). Thirdly, in economics, an
extensive literature has studied the relationships between HDI rankings, economic growth,
institutions, and other economic and social measures (Anand and Ravallion, 1993; Easterlin,
2000; Dasgupta, 2001). The conceptual underpinnings of the HDI can be found in the work by
Amartya Sen (i.e. 1977, 1984, 1985, 1987). For a recent mathematical ethical rationalization of
the HDI see Moreno-Ternero and Romer (2006). Oswald (1997), Blanchflower and Oswald
(2005) and Leigh and Wolfers (2006) explore links between a happiness index and the HDI.1
Despite extensive use of the HDI statistics, the drastic changes in the distribution of HDI
scores for developing countries, as displayed in Figure 1, have gone unnoticed in the academic
1

Other studies that specifically used the triple-bin classification include Kelley (1991), McGillivray (1991), Noorbakhsh (1998),
Baliamoune (2004) in development economics, Mazumdar (2002), Noorbakhsh (2006) in macroeconomics, Hargittai (1998),
Keiser et al. (2004) in communications and Guindon and Boisclair (2003) to analyze health outcomes across countries.

and policy literature. When the HDI was first published in 1990, the cross country-distribution
appeared to be approximately uniformly distributed between zero (least developed) and one
(most developed). Today, however, the distribution is twin-peaked with two sharp spikes around
the values of 0.5 and 0.8, which are the cut-off values for categorizing countries of ‘low’,
‘medium’ and ‘high’ human development.
In this paper, we investigate the role of data error on the published HDI and the
consequences for its use in statistical analysis. We address these questions by exploiting (1) the
originally published HDI time series, (2) the subindicator variables used to construct the HDI, (3)
changes to the HDI formula, and (4) documented data revisions. We identify three sources of
data error: measurement error due to data revisions, data error due to formula updating and
misclassification due to inconsistent cut-off values. After isolating data revision error from error
due to formula updates, we estimate country specific variances of the HDI scores. For example,
the variance due to data revision for Bolivia represents the distribution of possible HDI values
for Bolivia in a given year, which is solely created by updates to the data series. We show that
the HDI contains data error standard deviations ranging from 0.03 (United States) to 0.11
(Niger), which is significant given the 0 to 1 scale. We find that the magnitude of the error
variances is greater the lower the HDI rank, which is consistent with the quality of the statistical
agencies improving with higher development. Likewise, country specific variances due to
formula revisions are calculated. Mapping these cardinal noise measures onto the ordinal
dimension, we find that 11%, 21% and 34% of all countries can be interpreted as currently
misclassified in the development bins due to the three sources of data error, respectively.
We also investigate the ordinal rank error. Each year when the new HDI statistics are
published, much public attention focuses on the relative rank of a country to its rank in prior

3

years and to the rank position of competing countries. For example, when Canada lost the top
HDI number 1 position in 2001, The National Post (3rd of July, 2001) wrote: ‘We’re not No. 1!
Canada drops in UN rankings…Prime Minister Jean Chretien often refers to the report in public
statements and speeches…’. Or, in 1998, when Pakistan (rank 138) bypassed India (rank 139),
The Tribune (September 14th, 1998) noted: ‘Pak beat India, both lose!’.2 To investigate the
reliability of such statements, we calculate each country’s likelihood of deviation from its
original published HDI rank. We find that on average the expected absolute deviation is nine
rank positions. Furthermore, the average 95% confidence interval of our simulated HDI rank
deviations ranges from -21 ranks to +20 ranks for the 2.5% percentile and the 97.5% percentile
respectively. These calculations show that statements based on ordinal comparisons are to be
interpreted with great care.
Our results have direct implications for the academic literature. First, there is a vast
economic literature that uses the same country level data that are included in the construction of
the HDI, namely purchasing power parity adjusted income (i.e. Rogoff, 1996), life expectancy
(i.e. Acemoglu and Johnson, 2007) and the educational measures of literacy rate and school
enrollment statistics (i.e. Krueger and Lindahl, 2001). We investigate the inherent noise
characteristics for each of these variables separately by estimating country specific variances for
the underlying variables—GDP per capita, school enrollment, literacy rate and life expectancy.
We find that the variables of health and education exhibit particular large error variances in
developing countries; in comparison income has a smaller error variance but among the three
sub-indicators it reveals the largest updating bias. Second, the HDI has been used to analyze the
evolution of the world’s distribution of well being, to explore issues of inequality, polarization,

Pakistan ranked 119 and 138 and India ranked 118 and 139 in 1997 and 1998 respectively. For an extended discussion about
these and similar rank statements see Morse (2003).

foreign direct investment, development aid and to econometrically test various convergence
hypotheses in macroeconomics. By replicating some of these studies and carrying out sensitivity
analyses, we find that key parameters, such as estimated Gini coefficients and speed of
convergence parameters, vary by up to 100% in their values solely due to the measurement error.
Our paper is related to the literature that discusses the challenges in accurately estimating
national accounts and other aggregate statistics. Deaton and Heston (2008) provide an in depth
analysis of the various factors that affect PPP. In their case, in order to eliminate differences in
national price levels, GDP is combined with data by the International Comparison Program (ICP)
but the ICP’s methodologies are subject to various changes, (i.e. modifications of baskets,
Laspeyres versus Paasche index, product quality adjustments). In discussing previous revisions
of the methodologies, Deaton and Heston (2008) conclude that PPP data are ‘not always suitable
for the purposes to which they are put’. Krueger and Lindahl (2001) study the relationship
between economic growth and country level educational variables and discuss the direction of
bias one might expect by using different variables. Other papers that characterize the noise in
aggregate statistical data include Barro and Lee (2001) and de la Fuente and Doménech (2006)
for educational measures, Dowrick and Quiggin (1997) and Neary (2004) for income based
measures and Anderson (1999) for life expectancy. We add to this literature by systematically
isolating the different sources of error into data based errors, formula based errors and cut-off
value based errors. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to calculate country specific variance
measures of the HDI, income, life expectancy, literacy rate, school enrollment, as well as to
calculate indicators and probabilities of a country’s misclassification.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the data. Section
3 outlines the framework and methods of measuring variances and misclassifications due to data

5

revisions, formula changes and the threshold problem. Section 4 presents our results. Section 5
provides examples of how the HDI is used in various contexts and how errors can affects prior
academic analysis. We conclude with policy recommendations in Section 6.
2. Data
The HDI is a composite indicator measuring a country’s level of development along three
dimensions: health, education and income. These dimensions are expressed as unit free and
double bounded subindicators y1, y2, y3, each taking values between zero and one. The
subindicators themselves are functions of data x on primary and secondary school enrollment
statistics, literacy rate, life expectancy and GDP per capita adjusted by purchasing power parity
(PPP). Finally, the HDI is calculated as a simple average of the three (k = 1, 2, 3) subindicators,
HDI = 1/3kyk(x), which is then used for ordinal and cardinal comparisons. The HDI is published
annually in the Human Development Reports (HDR) by the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP), which are available for the years 1990 to 2006 (HDR, 1990 to 2006).3
2.1. Original versus Revised Data
In our analysis we exploit the fact that the original historical data matrix xt used by the
UNDP in year t differs from the revised matrix xRts which includes updates between t and s>t.
The original xt is available for the years t =1999 to 2006, whereas the revised data xRts are
available (i) for all years of the analyses, t = 1990 to 2006 and s = 2006 and (ii) for the HDI in t =
1975, the revised HDIR1975s is available for s = 1999, 2000,…, 2006. In this paper, xRt refers to
the variables for year t kindly provided to the authors as of fall of 2006 by the UNDP office,

3

The UNDP mainly draws the GDP data from the World Bank, the educational statistics are provided by UNESCO and life
expectancy comes from the Population Division of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Since countries do not
consistently provide data using the same methodologies, these data sets are complemented by data from the Penn World Tables
as well as by UNDP’s own estimates to impute missing values. See the technical appendices of the HDR (1990-2006) for details.

except stated otherwise. xt refers to the data that we hand-copied4 from the tth year Human
Development Report (HDR, 1990 to 2006).
2.2. The HDI Formulas and Computation of Counterfactuals
Since 1990, the UNDP has made three major updates to the formula used to construct the
HDI. For each year t and country i the HDI formula is given by
HDIit = hf(xit).
The formula h changed thrice as indexed by f {A, B, C}, which corresponds to the time periods
1990, 1995-1998 and 1999-2006, respectively. The three formulas are explained in the HDR
technical appendices (1990 to 1999) of Jahan (2000) and in the appendix of this web based
version.5 We construct three ‘counterfactuals’ denoted by hA(xRit), hB(xRit), and hC(xRit). Hence,
for the entire time series we recalculate what the HDI would have been if the alternate formulas
had been in place, using the most recent available historical data on the subindicators. In the
analysis we exploit exactly these differences between the ‘original’ HDI generated by the
formula that was active at time t compared to the HDI generated by the other two formulas that
were not active in that particular year t.
2.3. The Sample
We construct a balanced panel from 1990 to 2006. A country is included in our panel if it
meets the following two conditions: (a) the country exists continuously between 1990 and 2006
(e.g., Croatia is dropped); (b) between the three revised subindicators and the countries’ HDI as
provided by the UNDP, the total sum of missing data points is less or equal to five. Furthermore,
in some of our analysis we distinguish between industrialized and non-industrialized countries
whereby the industrialized countries are defined as in Table 1.1 of HDR (1991). We impute any

The data were hand-copied separately by two of the authors. Only after verifying that the two hand-copied data sets are 100%
identical, we proceeded with the analysis.

missing data points by linear interpolation. In this way we obtain a balanced panel 99 countries
of which 76 are non-industrialized countries and 23 are industrialized countries.
3. Sources of Data Error and Methodology to Measure Data Uncertainty
This section provides a detailed discussion of the three sources of data error:
measurement error due to data revisions (D), data noise due to formula updating (F) and
misclassification due to inconsistent cut-off values (C), which we abbreviate by D, F and C. We
propose a simple statistical framework to analyze these sources of error, which allows us to
calculate country specific variances and confidence intervals and to simulate country specific
probabilities of misclassification.
Before discussing the details of each source of error below, it is useful to illustrate when
the different types of errors (D, F and C) enter into the construction of the HDI. The columns of
Table 1 show the overall structure of the data and the rows display when each error category
contributes to the data uncertainty, depending on the level of data analyzed. The first column
shows that with respect to the primary data variables x, the only source of error is due to data
updating (D). For the subindicator functions y, two sources of errors are identified. First, with
respect to D, y is vulnerable because the data error of x is directly translated into y through the
function y(x). Additionally, the nonlinear functions y(x) are subject to formula changes (F) over
time. Similarly, the aggregate HDI measure is subject to D and F through HDI = 1/3kyk(x). The
HDI development categories are subject to error type C. Finally, the three types of error can be
calculated for any function of HDI, (HDI), e.g. Gini coefficients or regression parameters.
As we will make clear below, we calculate the three types of error independent of each
other. Hence it is not the case that error measure F will implicitly include some data error D or

8

vice versa. Only in Section 3.4 and 4.2 we show how the different type of errors add up and
discuss the correlation structures among them.
What are the distinctions between these sources of errors? While the first error D is well
known to econometricans as ‘measurement error’, the changes to the data by F and C are due to
subjective decisions by the data provider (here the UNDP). This subjective component changed
over time and impacted the construction and relative importance of sub-variables of the HDI as
well as the judgment on how to classify countries. Another distinction between D, F and C is that
our first two types of errors, D and F, are cardinal in nature. This is in contrast to our third type
of error, C, which is purely ordinal in nature in the sense that countries are either misclassified or
not within the UN triple-bin classification system.
3.1. First Source of Data Error: Measurement error
To obtain the first measure of the randomness of the HDI data, we exploit the following
exogenous changes to the data over time: The data xt (as used by the UNDP for the HDR at year
t) are in general not the same data as the UNDP publishes in year s for the same data year t. As
revised statistics become available, the UNDP updates the original data matrix xt at year s, s t,
which we then denote xRts.
There are literally hundreds of reasons for data updates each year. The HDI draws their
datasets from a multitude of domestic and international agencies (e.g. UNESCO, World Bank,
Penn Tables). Often an agency may have data only for some subset of countries and some subset
of years. The remaining data points are then filled by datasets from other agencies, and
occasionally are interpolated by neighboring years or countries. The dozens of footnotes in the
yearly HDR reports point to the institutions that changed data year by year. The complexity of
the problem may be best illustrated with a specific example: since 1999, the UNDP publishes

9

historic HDI scores going back until the year 1975, HDI1975. Figure 2 displays HDI1975 scores as
they are reported in each of the HDR reports from 1999 to 2006. In every year, between 1999
and 2006, substantial data revisions took place for the same 1975 HDI score. For example, while
in 2000 Portugal was reported to have a historic HDI1975 of 0.73 (that was below the HDI1975 of
Venezuela), by 2006 Portugal’s HDI1975 increased to 0.79 and is now substantially above the
2006 reported HDI1975 of Venezuela. On average across all countries the HDI updating bias for
the year 1975 can be calculated as 0.003 with a standard deviation of the updating error of 1975
= 0.012. Given that the data updates took place after a quarter of a century, we consider 0.012 to
be large. Instead, in a world of good data quality 1975 should be close to zero. This implies that
whenever an analyst uses UNDP data, the same analysis run at a later date will result in different
estimates due to a changed data matrix. Hence, when the HDI is released in year t, the value
must be understood as an inexact value subject to future data revisions. This problem is what we
refer to as measurement error from data updating.
To parameterize this measurement error, assume that the relationship between the
observed HDI score of country i and the true (but unknown) subindicators, denoted by y*itk, can
be expressed as
HDIit = 1/3k(y*itk + εitk)
where εitk is orthogonal to y*itk and is distributed with mean mitk and country specific variance
s2itk. The relationship between the observed HDI score of country i and the true HDI*
consequently is HDIit = HDIit* + eit with eit being the composite error term distributed with mean
1/3kmitk and country specific variance 2i that is determined by the covariance structure of the
measurement error of the subindicators in country i, covi(εtk).

10

Exploiting the original xt and revised xRt, we now are in the position to calculate country
specific variances of the measurement error due to data updating (D) given by
2D,i = t(ht(xit)–ht(xitR))2/(T–1) for  t  

(1)

with ht denoting the formula which was active at time t and T = ABC\2006 is the union of the
three time periods A, B, C, except for the last year of 2006. T denotes the number of elements in
set T. The variance of the data-updating measurement error is based on the difference between
the original HDI as published in the HDR at year t, ht(xit), and the reconstructed counterfactual
HDI for year t using revised data xitR available to us today. To obtain a consistent estimate of the
variance, we assume that ht(xitR) represents our currently best available estimate of HDIit* and
discuss in our result the implications of this assumption.
Importantly note that we calculate 2D,i independently from error type F. Specifically, we
disentangle D from F by constructing each pair of data {ht(xit), ht(xitR)}t  t   to be conditional
on the same HDI formula, namely the formula that was active at time t. (Instead, if one were
using the pairs of data {ht(xit), HDIR} as reported in the yearly UNDP reports, one would have
erroneously incorporated error-type F into error type D).
3.2. Second Source: Changes in HDI Formula
Since its release in 1990, the HDI was often criticized with respect to its analytical
framework and methodology (Desai, 1991; Kelley, 1991; McGillivray, 1991; Aturupane et al.,
1994; Noorbakhsh, 1998). The UNDP responded to this challenge by working with Nobel
laureate Amartya Sen, Sudhir Anand, Paul Streeten and others to intellectually lead an effort to
update the methodology and value judgments. As a result UNDP has made three major updates
to the formula used to construct the HDI which are further discussed in Anand and Sen (1994,
1997, 2000), Jahan (2000), the technical appendices of the HDRs (1990 to 2006) and

11

summarized in the appendix of the web based version paper. These three changes are clearly
visible in the empirical distribution of the HDI displayed in Figure 3. In particular, different
distributional characteristics occur for the sub-periods A (1990), B (1995-1998) and C (19992006) that correspond to the three formula regimes hA(xit), hB(xit), and hC(xit), respectively.
We exploit this variation of the HDI scores across the counterfactual formulas to
calculate country specific variances due to the formula (F) updates that is
2F,i = tg (hg(xitR)–hC(xitR))2/(2T–1)  t  

(2)

where g is the index to sum over the formula indices A, and B. The variance 2F,i is based on the
country specific differences of the HDI generated by the most recent and improved formula hC
compared to the HDI counterfactuals generated by the other two formulas hB and hA. We do
acknowledge that the formula revisions were undertaken to improve the HDI statistics and hence
one interpretation of 2F,i is to understand it as a measure of historic noise due to the formula
updates. Alternatively, the country specific measures 2F,i can be interpreted as a present
measure of noise, if the UNDP will similarly continue to change the formula in the future and the
scores today would have to be understood as subject to those future formula revisions.
Note that we again isolate the error type F from the former error type D. Hence it is not
the case that error-type F incorporates error-type D, and/or vice versa.6
3.3. Third Source of Misclassification: Arbitrary Cutoff Values
In comparison to the cardinal measures of noise due to D and F, our third measure of
error, C, is entirely ordinal. It is an error of misclassification due to the arbitrariness of the two
cut-off values used to categorize countries into ‘low’, ‘medium’ and ‘high’ development

6

We achieve the independence because the function σF is defined conditional on the revised data xR. Hence all terms on the right
hand side of σF are ‘counterfactual’ measures, what the HDI would have been if the revised data xR had been already known in
prior years under the different formula assumptions.

12

countries. Despite the fact that changes made to the HDI formula did have considerable impacts
on the empirical HDI distributions as displayed in Figure 3, the UNDP has decided to use the
same cut-off values (0.5 and 0.8) since 1990. Since the original cutoff-values are supposed to
distinguish three qualities of human development, with each formula change the UNDP could
instead have adjusted the cut-off values in such a way that the new adjusted thresholds again
reflect these same value judgments for the levels of quality. One possible procedure7 to obtain
revised threshold values—that are consistent with the initial 1990 value judgment of classifying
quality and consistent with the entire history of formula changes—is as follows. In 1990,
Morocco and Egypt were the two countries closest around the original cut off value of 0.5 (with
HDI scores of 0.49 and 0.50, respectively). On the counterfactual distribution of formula hC
applied to 1990, these two countries take on the values 0.54 and 0.56. Taking the mean (0.55)
provides the revised threshold for separating between the low and medium human development
groups. Similarly we proceed with the cut off value 0.8 and obtain the revised value 0.70.
3.4. Overall Error Variance
So far, we have treated the two sources of errors D and F independently of each other.
The user of the HDI statistics may, however, be also interested in having a sense of the “overall”
error within the HDI database.8 To this end, we calculate the country-specific overall cardinal
error variance statistics as
σ2(overall)i = σ2Di+σ2Fi + 2cov(eDi,eFi)
which takes into account the covariance structure of the individual error contributions,
cov(eDi,eFi) = t(eDit–mDi)(eFit–mFi)/T
7

Our procedure to choose the revised bin cutoffs is based upon the objective to maintain constant the initial (1990) value
judgment by the UNDP, in the sense that the thresholds separate low from medium and medium from high developed countries.
One referee suggested selecting those cutoff values which maximize the objective function to maintain the development category
of as many countries as possible. This would lead to the revised thresholds values of 0.62 and 0.76.

We thank the editor for providing the idea to aggregate errors.

whereby eDit = HDIit–HDIRit and eFit = f(hf(xitR)–hC(xitR))/2. We can thus analyze how much
each source of error (1) and (2) contributes to the overall level of error in the HDI database.
3.5. Simulation 1: The expected number of misclassified countries
For the cardinal sources of data error, for each country we can calculate the probability of
being misclassified. Given the parameterization of the measurement error as HDIi2006* = HDIi2006
- ei2006 and assuming ei2006 ~ N(0,2.,i), normally distributed with mean zero and variance 2.,i (as
calculated by 2F,i, 2D,i, and 2(overall),i) we analytically calculate for each country the
probability of being misclassified as

where p() is the probability density function of the estimated HDIi* distributions. Hence, for
countries reported to be ‘low development’, we calculate the probability of being classified as a
medium or a high development country; similarly, we proceed for the ‘medium’ and ‘high’
development countries. Finally, adding these integrals over all countries provides the expected
number of misclassified countries.
3.6. Simulation 2: The expected number of deviation in HDI ranks
In addition to sorting countries into the three broad HDI categories of ‘low’, ‘medium’
and ‘high’, the UNDP statistics are used to produce league rankings of countries. We calculate
the expected number of absolute deviations in rank by simulating (n = 1,…, 10,000) the 2006
HDI ranking. The simulated rankings are produced by calculating for every country i the
simulated HDI as SimHDIi,2006 = HDIi,2006 + i with i distributed as mean zero and variance

14

σ2(overall)i. Finally, after each nth simulation country i’s simulated rank is recorded relative to
its actual observed rank in 2006.
4. Results
4.1. Results with Respect to the Cardinal Errors of Data Updating and Formula Changes
If one followed Oskar Morgenstern’s (1970) advice given in the introduction, an
alternative way for UNDP to report HDI scores would be to report country specific noise
measures. To do so, we display country specific standard errors in Table 2. With respect to the
standard errors due to the measurement error of data updating (column 8), we find that D,i
ranges between a minimum value of 0.004 (United States) and a maximum value of 0.069
(Syria), with an average value across all countries of 0.026. Given that the HDI is an average
over three subindicators, whereby positive and negative deviations in the subindicators cancel
out,9 and given that the HDI is scaled from of 0 to 1, these standard deviations are large and
significant. Figure 4 displays the relationship between the country specific measurement error
due to the data revisions, D,i and the countries’ HDI score (as of 2006). We note that more
developed countries have smaller updating variances. Similarly column (3) displays the country
specific data measurement errors due to formula updates F,i, whose ranges on average are even
higher compared to D,i. We find the estimated F,i range between a minimum value of 0.034 and
a maximum value of 0.127 with a world average standard deviation of 0.072.
Since the HDI is primarily used as an ordinal measure, we now turn to the impact of these
cardinal measures on the ordinal dimension. Figure 5 displays the case of the “average” nonindustrial country with HDI = 0.65 using the average standard deviation over all non-

9

The correlation between the three subindicator error terms εitk, k  {1,2,3} is close to zero and can be viewed as distributed
approximately independently. Hence the average standard deviation of the subindicator errors s2k must be larger in magnitude,
compared to the standard deviation of the HDI, D,i. Section 4.4 confirms this by analyzing the compound error term.

15

industrialized countries due to data revisions, D=0.03 and due to formula updates F=0.08.
Figure 5 shows that substantial probability mass is spread over all three development categories.
In Table 2, the category specific probabilities are displayed for all countries in columns (4)-(6),
and (9)-(11) for the formula based error and data upgrading errors respectively. For example, as
of 2006, South Africa, Mongolia, Syria, India, Honduras, Bolivia have non-zero probabilities of
belonging to all three categories simultaneously. Even a high human development country, such
as Costa Rica with HDI of 0.84, can still be a ‘low’ with 0.3% probability and yet be ‘medium’
to 37%. Finally, columns (7) and (12) display the total probability of a particular country being
misclassified by using formula (4). The sum over these column probabilities show that currently,
in expectation, 10.4 countries are misclassified due to data updating measurement error and 20.7
countries are misclassified due to formula updates; these numbers translate into, 11% and 21% of
all countries being misclassified.
We interpret the misclassification of 11% due to data updating as conservative because
2D,i is just based on “short term” differences between xt and xRt, based on the years from 1990
to 2006. There also exists “long term” data updating error, which taking into account, that may
increase 2D as |HDIt HDIRts| increases with s. While we cannot capture this long-term effect by
formula (1) (due to the lack of published original data prior to the HDR of 1990), we illustrated
the magnitude of such “long term” drift in Figure 2.
4.2. Overall Cardinal Error and Rank Simulations
The typical user of the HDI statistics may not be concerned about the individual error
statistics σ2D and σ2F if they are calculated independently of each other, but the researcher may be
more interested in obtaining a sense of the overall error in the data. For this purpose we calculate
country specific overall cardinal error statistics σ2(overall)i and find that the world average of

16

these measures σ2(overall) = iσ2(overall)i/N equals to 0.007, compared to σ2D = 0.001 and σ2F =
0.006. Furthermore we find that all country specific covariance terms cov(eDi,eFi) are relatively
small (all correlation coefficients are smaller than 0.06 in absolute value) which implies that the
updating error is not linearly correlated with the formula error. This implies that 86% of the total
HDI variance is contributed by the formula error and 14% by the measurement error due to data
updating.10 By using the same methodology as in Section 3.5, we calculate the “overall”
expected number of countries misclassified as 22.9. The country specific overall variance
statistics are given in column (3) of Table 3.
Moreover, column (1) of Table 3 displays the country specific expected absolute value of
rank displacements based upon the rank of the country’s HDI in 2006. Worldwide, the average
country is displaced by about nine ranks. This average absolute displacement obscures the
direction of rank displacement and the uncertainty over rank displacements. To this end, Figure 6
displays the average rank displacement over 10,000 simulations as a function of the countries’
2006 HDI score along with the 95% confidence intervals. The confidence intervals are large,
leading to an average deviation of -21 ranks and +20 ranks for the 2.5% percentile and the 97.5%
percentile respectively. Figure 6 also shows that countries with a low initial 2006 rank (low HDI
score) do on average better in the simulated rank statistics and countries with an initial high HDI
in 2006 are more likely to lose ranks in the simulations.
4.3. Results with Respect to the Cutoff Value Problem
Our third measure of misclassification is due to the non-adjustment problem of the cutoff values 0.5 and 0.8 that the UN uses to classify countries as low, medium and high human
developed countries. If the UNDP had adjusted the cut-off values in a manner consistent with the
10

We calculate the %-contribution of the jth cardinal source of error to the overall error as σ2ji/ σ2(overall)i. This calculation is
hence net of the covariance of the two error sources. The covariance terms can essentially be neglected due to the fact these are
small in magnitude.

17

1990 classification, since 1999 (the year of the last formula update), the thresholds should be at
the values 0.55 and 0.70, as opposed to 0.5 and 0.8. This lack of adjustment of the cutoff values
results in 34% of the countries being misclassified today.11 Among all developing countries the
percentage of misclassification is even higher: 45%. With such a high percentage statements
such as ‘over the last decade x% of African countries successfully moved from the ‘low’ to the
‘medium’ human development category’—as expressed in numerous policy papers and news
reports (United Nations 1996, People’s Daily 2001, Daily Times 2005)—become useless at best,
if not blatantly misleading. The listing of the misclassified countries due to this source of error is
provided in Table 4.
4.4. Measurement Error with Respect to the Underlying Variables of the HDI
Thus far, we analyzed the data error of the HDI. Since the same variables used to
construct the HDI serve as key data in many academic studies as well as inputs to many other
international comparative statistics, it is worthwhile analyzing the subindicators y pertaining to
health, education and income in more detail.
The first four columns of Table 5 display summary statistics of the overall HDI updating
error, e, and the vector of subindicator updating errors, ε, for our sample of 76 non-industrialized
countries. In general, the standard deviations of the health and education indexes are larger than
the standard deviations of the income statistics. It is interesting to note, however, that the main
driver for the HDI upward bias stems from the change to the income index (mincome=0.01).12
Instead, the errors on the health and the education indices show distributions that are centered
around zero. Note, that the min/max columns in Table 5 reveal some enormous changes; the

11

The percentage of countries misclassified is calculated as the number of countries that have HDI scores in the ranges [0.5,
0.55) and [0.70, 0.8) divided by the total number of countries in our sample (99).
12
Statistically, this upward bias with a standard deviation of 0.02 is not significantly different from zero.

18

income index changed by 15% (Sudan and Chad) and the education index even by 25%
(Mongolia) on the total scale from 0 to 1.
One may ask whether the three subindicator updating errors are correlated. An analysis of
the year-by-year correlation matrices of the errors does not show any systematic co-movement,
as the correlation coefficients are close to zero in all years. This suggests that the statistical
adjustments on the three dimensions are independent of each other and indicates that the
respective national statistical offices responsible for health, education, and income statistics have
no systematic contemporaneous responses. Furthermore, statistical independence of the three
subindicator error variables εk implies that their errors must be on average larger than the
variance of the HDI error e, which is confirmed by Table 5. Hence, while the three subindicator
errors offset each other with respect to the HDI,13 when working with the variables of education,
income and health, one faces even larger data error.
To analyze the drivers of the HDI data error in more detail, we calculate country specific
noise measures due to data revisions with respect to the underlying variables, x. Table 6 reports
country specific standard errors calculated as the country specific standard deviation (xn)i
(computed analogously to (2) by exploiting the 2006 data revision of xnit for t = 1999 to 2005).
In order to obtain a sense of the relative magnitude of the errors in each variable, we divide the
standard deviations by the level corresponding variable in the year 2006, xni2006 and display the
resulting relative standard errors in Figure 7. Adult literacy rate, GDP and the gross enrollment
ratio contribute most to the updating error of the HDI. In contrast, life expectancy is revised

13

Under the assumption of independence, the standard deviation for the composite HDI error, e, is given by
std(e)=SQRT[(ksk2/9)], which, after replacing sk by , equals to std(e)= 0.014. The estimated standard deviation of the HDI
measurement error by formula (1) applied to period C is 0.015, hence very close to std(e), confirming this theoretical result of
independence.

19

much less. As is clearly recognizable in Figure 7, we find that the more highly developed the
country the smaller its measurement error due to data updating.
5. Discussion of the results
Given that the HDI is subject to a considerable amount of measurement error, the use of
the HDI and its triple bin classification system can lead to serious interpretability problems. We
now investigate the consequences of these three sources of errors by replicating prior studies and
uses of the HDI, with each of the analysis being uniquely linked to our three sources of errors.
5.1. The HDI as a definitional measure
While there does not exist a standardized definition of the term “developing country”, the
definition is often linked to the HDI, as being a country with low to moderate development
status. In fact, often scientific studies have been explicitly using the HDI system to identify a set
of developing countries (i.e. Noorbakhsh, 2006; Varenne, 2007; Lauber and Roessler, 2007;
Alvan, 2009). Leading online dictionaries do refer to the HDI in order to define the term
“developing country” (Wikipedia, 2008; Babylon, 2009; SearchWiki, 2009). Here it is common
to differentiate development status by using three different colors. In Figure 8, we recreate such a
map by displaying the HDI scores for 2006. To demonstrate the impact of misclassification in
our sample, we reclassify the countries using the updated thresholds of 0.55 and 0.70 as
discussed in Section 3.3. The visual impact of this reclassification is striking, especially in South
America, Southeast Asia and Africa. This misclassification is particularly problematic, if
organizations/institutions use these categories to design particular policies or rules.
5.2. The HDI and Foreign Development Aid:
Although, to our knowledge, the HDI is not formally used by any development agency as
the sole index used to determine the distribution of development funds, there are clear

20

indications that the HDI plays a significant role in governmental institutions’ and NGOs’
decisions for foreign aid allocation.14 In 2000, the Deputy Director of the UNDP exemplified this
debate by stating:
‘At the global level, issues are now being explored as to whether bilateral aid can be
allocated on the basis of HDI, or the core funds of multilateral agencies can be based on
the index […]’ (p. 10, Jahan, 2000).
In fact, ‘charity scorecards’ are increasingly used as a tool for helping individuals decide which
countries to donate money to. Here the HDI can be used to construct such a score. For example,
on the homepage of http://www.charityscorecard.org/ a world map of HDI scores is displayed.
The use of the HDI in this context may explicitly and implicitly steer users to “misclassified
countries”. Further, the triple bin classification is often used for report writing purposes to
describe donor activities by governmental organizations (United Nations, 1996; HDR, 2001 to
2007) and non-governmental organizations. For example, Geneva Global (2007), which holds
investments of 60 million client dollars in development projects, structures its funds according to
the three HDI categories. For each year, the United Nations (HDR 2001 to 2006) analyzes the
newest data on development aid as a function of the three human development categories.
Drawing on these HDR statistics, Table 7 summarizes that across all years countries in the ‘low’
category obtained 3.4 times the official development assistance (ODA) per capita as compared to
the medium development countries, which we do not claim is a causal effect but rather an
interesting correlation.
5.3. Use of the HDI statistics in the academic literature

14

For a related discussion see Alesina and Dollar (2000), Alesina and Weder (2002), Arcelus et al. (2005), Bandyopadhyay and
Wall (2006), Easterly et al. (2004).

21

The HDI has been increasingly employed in the academic literature to describe the
evolution of the world’s “welfare” distribution in terms of various measures of inequality, such
as the Gini coefficient, and to discuss the path of polarization, e.g. Pillarisetti (1997), Ogwang
(2000), Mazumdar (2002), Noorbakhsh (2006), Prados de la Escosura (2007). The results
published in these studies can differ greatly depending on which year the researcher collected the
data in. To illustrate, Figure 9 displays HDI Gini coefficients using the formulas hA, hB and hC for
data covering 1975 to 2005 in five years intervals. The values produced by formula hA are 25%
to 50% higher and the time trend steeper compared to the time series generated by formula hC.
This substantial difference would lead to different conclusions or policy recommendations by the
analyst. For a recent discussion on the relevance of levels and gradients of Gini estimates see for
example Sala-i-Martin (2006) and Prados de la Escosura (2007).
We find that a number of recent studies are sensitive to random selection of countries that
is due to the “arbitrariness” of the cut-off values: For example in the macroeconomic literature,
Mazumdar (2002) and Noorbakhsh (2006) use the triple bins to analyze the existence of
convergence clubs (Quah 1996) by testing the beta and the sigma conditional convergence
hypothesis, originally discussed in Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1992). In particular, Noorbakhsh
(2006) runs beta-convergence regressions of the form
ln(hdiit+T/hdiit)/T =  + ln(hdiit) +it

(3)

conditional on the country belonging to the ‘low’ development bin. The dependent variable is the
annualized growth of the HDI variable for country i over the period t to t+T and hdiit is the ratio
of HDI in the ith country to the average for the sample.15 The regression is then repeated for the

15

A value of β in the range of (-1, 0) would imply β-convergence of the countries in the sample. A β of zero means no
convergence and a positive value for β indicates divergence, with the speed of convergence/divergence the higher the absolute
value of β.

22

bins ‘medium’ and ‘high’ and the comparison of the  estimates is used to analyze the existence
of convergence clubs.
To illustrate the consequences of the random selection, we first rerun the convergence
regression (3) conditional on the HDI being in the interval A0 = [0.5, 0.8) as specified in
Noorbakhsh (2006, p. 10, table 3). Then we perform the same regression with the adjusted cutoff values in the set A1 = [0.55, 0.70). The results are displayed in Table 8. Comparing the main
parameter of interest, , the estimate of the second regression is about 100% off the first
regression implying a much faster speed of convergence.16 This demonstrates that results based
on the reported HDI can be very sensitive to changes of the HDI triple bin classification system.
5.4. Implications of the results in statistical analysis
Econometrically speaking, the average error measures 2D and 2F calculated in Section
4.1 imply that there is a 3% and 14% downward attenuation bias in a ordinary least squares
(OLS) regression, y = 1 + 2HDI* + , if the observed HDI—instead of the “true” (but
unknown) HDI*—is used as the regressor (for any variable y of interest). The bias of the OLS
estimate b2 is given by17
plim bD2 = [1-2D/(2D+2HDI*)]2  0.972
and
plim bF2 = [1-2F/(2F+2HDI*)]2  0.862.
This is important since in many econometric cross-country studies the HDI is used as a regressor,
i.e. Globerman and Shapiro (2002), Mazumdar (2002), Sanyal and Samanta (2004), Neumayer

Note that the two  estimates are statistically significant with t values of -6.74 and -.4.59 for the sample of countries in A0 and
in A1, respectively. We reject at the 1% significance level the hypothesis of uniform convergence in A0 and in A1 based on the
Wald test examining whether β1 is different from β0, based on the pooled sample with appropriate interaction terms, with
standard errors clustered by country.
16

17

2HDI* is approximated by the empirical analogue of the 2006 HDI scores, σ̂ 2HDI* = 0.036.

23

(2003), Noorbakhsh (2006), Leigh and Wolfers (2006). This is even more crucial when working
with the individual subindicator variables, since (as shown in Section 4.4) their average standard
deviation of the measurement error is larger than the error of the HDI.
6. Conclusions
This paper identifies three sources of HDI data error and we make the following
empirical contributions. First, we calculate country specific noise measures due to measurement
error, formula choice and inconsistencies in the cut-off values. We find that the HDI statistics
contain a substantial amount of noise on the order of 0.01 to 0.11 standard deviations. In
analyzing the sources of the updating error we calculate country specific variances of GDP per
capita, literacy rate, educational enrollment and life expectancy and we calculate the
interdependence between these measures. We find that in general the higher the development
status of a country, the more precise are the reported data. Second, we calculate the
misclassification measures with respect to these three sources of data error by simulating the
probabilities of being misclassified and sensitivity analysis of the cut-off values. We find that up
to 45% of the developing countries are misclassified due to the failure to update the cutoff
values. The discrete classification system is vulnerable when many countries are close to the
thresholds, as is the case in the most recent years. Third, we discuss various empirical examples
from the prior macroeconomic/development literature where the HDI has been employed and
find that its use is problematic. Key parameters vary by up to 100% in their values. Although
there may be certain benefits for the UN and charities for using a triple-bin classification
system—bins are likely to improve publicity for the HDI and may hence help with more efficient
internal organization of aid institutions—our results raise serious concerns about the system. We
suggest that the United Nations should discontinue the practice of classifying countries into these

24

triple bins because in our view the two cut-off values are arbitrary, can provide incentives for
strategic behavior in reporting official statistics, and have the potential to misguide politicians,
investors, charity donators and the public at large.
This paper did not investigate the drivers of why in the early years of the HDI—when its
political role was still uncertain—the distribution as displayed in Figure 1 looked so different
from today’s. However, we caution governments, private investors, donor organizations and
users of the charity scorecards not to take the triple bin system as a tool for international
negotiations (Hu, 2009), foreign direct investments (Arcelus et al., 2005), pricing (Bate and
Boateng, 2007), or the allocation of foreign aid (Jahan, 2000; Neumayer, 2003). Such politically
sensitive uses of the HDI might potentially provide perverse incentives for a country to
manipulate the subindicator variables, if it has realized the comparative advantage of a 0.49 HDI
score vs. a 0.51 score. In fact, announcements such as the statement by Jahan (2000) (discussed
in Section 5.2) might have just created these incentives. We quote Oskar Morgenstern (1970):
‘Governments, too are not free from falsifying statistics. This occurs, for example, when
they are bargaining with other governments and wish to obtain strategic advantages or
feel impelled to bluff [...]. A special study of these falsified, suppressed, and
misrepresented government statistics is greatly needed and should be made.’

Symbol * states that estimate of ‘Differences in means’ is statically significant at 1% level, tested by regressing the vector of
updating errors on a constant and an indicator variable that takes the value one if the country is industrialized and zero
otherwise using robust standard errors. Symbol † indicates that the estimate of the same regression is different from zero only
at the 15% significance level.

Notes: On the horizontal axis we display the HDI, which ranges from 0 to 1. 1990/91 are the first and 2005/06 are last two years for which
the HDI scores originally have been made available (HDR, 1990, 1991, 2005, 2006). To make the HDI-distributions comparable across
years we use the balanced panel of 99 developing countries that have been evaluated by the UNDP for all years. Countries that existed for a
subset of years only (e.g. Croatia) are not considered. All densities are estimated by the Epanechnikov kernel method with bandwidth 0.01.

Appendix
Formula Changes
The most important changes are described in the following subsections, and the reader is referred to
Anand and Sen (1994, 1997, 1998), the technical appendices of the HDRs (1990 to 2006) and to Jahan
(2000) for details.
Income. At first, in 1990 GDP per capita (in PPP) was logged in the income index. Between 1991 and
1998, however income above a certain cut-off point got substantially adjusted with a regressive version
of the “Atkinson Function". The cut-off point was taken as the average world income on the assumption
that every person should have at least this level of income for building basic capabilities (Jahan 2000).
Since this formulation however was argued to particularly punish middle income countries, the original
formulation of logging GDP per capita was again introduced in 1999 with formula hC (Anand and Sen,
1998).
Education. Following the suggestion by Kelley (1991), compared to 1990, in 1991 mean years of
schooling was added as a second component to adult literacy to form a more general index of education.
Adult literacy was given two-thirds weight and mean years of schooling one-third weight according to an
argument that adult literacy is a more representative stock variable for educational attainment. However,
the variable “mean years of schooling” was constructed in a complicated way and for some of the
countries it was criticized to not reflect their educational infrastructure properly (Jahan 2000). In an effort
to further improve the measure, from 1995 onward, mean year of schooling was replaced by the
combined gross enrolment of schooling at the primary, secondary and tertiary level of education.
Maxima and mimina. Until 1994, in order to normalize the variables x into the double bounded indices
y, observed maxima and minima were used as goalposts. This created however the problem that it got
difficult to distinguish whether changes in the HDI of a country was because of its improved
performance or because of changes to the maxima and minima of the sample of countries considered. In
order to make HDI trends over time more meaningful, since 1994 fixed maxima and minima were
introduced based on the trends of the variables of what that their values was estimated to be in the
following 25 years (HDR, 1994).

HDI formulas hf used by the UNDP in the three subperiods f  {A, B, C}
Formula hC
y1i = healthi = (life expectancyi – 25 ) / (85 – 25)
y2i = educationi = 2/3 adult literacy indexi + 1/3 combined gross enrollment indexi
y3i = incomei = min(1, (log(GDP per capitai) – log(100)) / (log(40000) – log(100)))
adult literacy indexi = (adult literacy ratei – 0) / (100 – 0)
gross enrollment indexi =min(1, (Combined gross enrolment ratio for primary, secondary and tertiary
level schoolsi / 100)18
Formula hB
income is calculated by a version of the "Atkinson Function". Given a cutoff value c
W(y*) = y* for y* < c
W(y*) = c + 2(y* – c)^(1/2) for y* in [c, 2c]
W(y*) = c + 2(c)^(1/2) + 3(y* – c)^(1/3) for y* in [2c, 3c]
for [3c, 4c], [4c, 5c] etc.
whereby c is defined as ‘world average income’.19 With this function defined,
y3i = incomei = W(y*i) = (W(GDP per capitai) – W(100)) / W(40000)
y1i and y2i are defined as in formula hC
Formula hA
y1i = healthi = (life expectancyi – low1) / (high1 – low1)
y2i = educationi = adult literacy ratei – low2) / (high2 – low2)
y3i = incomei = log(GDP per capitai) – log(low3)) / (log(high3) – log(low3))
The "goalposts" of lowk and highk for each subindicator k  {1,2,3} are the values of the minimum and
the maximum of the kth subindicator index of all considered countries. In 1990, the implicit goalposts
were 42 and 78 for life expectancy, 12.3 and 100 for literacy rate, and 10^2.34 and 10^3.68 for GDP per
capita.

The combined gross enrolment ratio is calculated for the number of students enrolled in primary, secondary and tertiary levels of
education, regardless of age, as percentage of the population of official school age for the three levels. The gross enrolment ratio can be
greater than 100% as a result of grade repetition and entry at ages younger or older than the typical age at that grade level. For this reason
the education index takes the minimum of one and the ratio.

This function is described on page 111 in the Technical Notes of the HDR of 1995.
