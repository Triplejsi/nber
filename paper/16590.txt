Are all Credit Default Swap Databases Equal?

NBER Working Paper No. 16590
December 2010
JEL No. F33
ABSTRACT
The presence of different prices in different databases for the same securities can impair the comparability
of research efforts and seriously damage the management decisions based upon such research. In this
study we compare the six major sources of corporate Credit Default Swap prices: GFI, Fenics, Reuters
EOD, CMA, Markit and JP Morgan, using the most liquid single name 5-year CDS of the components
of the leading market indexes, iTraxx (European firms) and CDX (US firms) for the period from 2004
to 2010. We find systematic differences between the data sets implying that deviations from the common
trend among prices in the different databases are not purely random but are explained by idiosyncratic
factors as well as liquidity, global risk and other trading factors. The lower is the amount of transaction
prices available the higher is the deviation among databases. Our results suggest that the CMA database
quotes lead the price discovery process in comparison with the quotes provided by other databases.
Several robustness tests confirm these results.

1. Introduction
Over the last decade, the Credit Default Swap (CDS) market has grown rapidly.1 Given
the growth and the size of this market, quoted and transaction prices of CDS contracts
are widely thought to be a gauge of financial markets’ overall situation, as suggested by
the GM/Ford credit episode in 2005, the US subprime fiasco in 2007-2009 or the
Europe’s debt crisis in 2010. Academic and policymakers alike have voiced concerns
with respect to the CDS market’s role in the above mentioned episodes and its possible
influence in other financial markets, credit-oriented or otherwise. However, to properly
address current concerns, careful empirical research is needed and therefore dependable
CDS price data is a key requirement. The CDS market is an Over The Counter (OTC)
market almost entirely populated by institutional investors and therefore, in contrast
with an organized exchange like the NYSE, there are no formally established clearing
and settlement mechanisms providing reliable information on prices. The information
on prices must be gathered from market participants on the basis of their voluntary
participation on periodic surveys, with all the potential shortcomings such a situation
may bring about. For instance, Leland (2009) reports that Bloomberg’s CDS data is
frequently revised weeks after and often disagrees substantially with other data sources
such as Datastream. Given that price data deserve special attention, as the validity and
power of the empirical results must be based on a dependable data source, in this study
we investigate the differences in the main data sources employed by researchers and
policymakers in this area. Specifically, we compare the six data sources for CDS prices

1 The global notional value of CDSs outstanding at the end of 2004, 2005 and 2006 was $8.42, $17.1 and
$34.4 trillion, respectively. The CDS market exploded over the past decade to more than $45 trillion in
mid-2007 and more than $62 trillion in the second half of the same year, according to the ISDA. The size
of the (notional) CDS market in mid-2007 is roughly twice the size of the U.S. stock market (which is
valued at about $22 trillion) and far exceeds the $7.1 trillion mortgage market and $4.4 trillion U.S.
treasuries market. However, the notional amount outstanding decreased significantly during 2008 to $54.6
trillion in mid-2008 and $38.6 trillion at the end of 2008. This declining trend followed in 2009 (31.2 in
mid-2009 and 30.4 at the end of 2009).

2

commonly used in almost all the extant research: GFI, Fenics, Reuters EOD, Credit
Market Analytics (CMA) DataVision (CMA hereafter), Markit and JP Morgan. The first
five databases are analyzed jointly for American and European firms while the JP
Morgan data is employed additionally as a robustness test for a subset of European
firms.
In this paper we describe the databases’ main features and point out the deviations
between them both in the cross section and in the time series dimension. We also study
the extent to which there is an advantage, in terms of data quality, in choosing one from
the six data sources.
Two price time series for the same single name CDS reported by different data sources
should, in principle, be very close in the sense that both share a common trend, the
underlying true value of the asset. More specifically, their distributional characteristics
(mean, volatility, asymmetry, and kurtosis) as well as their time series behavior
(autocorrelations, degree of integration) should be very tightly related. Even if there are
deviations from the common trend between the price series reported by the different
datasets, one should expect that these deviations are non-systematic (pure measurement
errors) and therefore unrelated both to idiosyncratic factors (firm size, industrial sector)
and to systematic market liquidity or trading activity factors. If all the data sources are
consistent among them, the use of a given data source should not affect the research
results and their financial and policy implications. But if there are significant deviations
among them, the research implications can be sensitive to the specific data base
employed and therefore open to challenge on these grounds. Moreover, any economic
implication gathered by investors or regulators from the academic research could be
unduly influenced by the data source employed.

3

Therefore, there are compelling reasons to test whether the different data sources, on
which almost all the extant empirical studies are based, are consistent among them. If
they are not, and the divergences among them are not purely random, hitherto published
empirical research on this matter should be viewed with considerable caution. This
inconsistency derived from the private price’s providers would also imply a damaging
lack of market transparency affecting all financial agents such as investors, risk
managers, and regulators.
We study the consistency of six different CDS data sources in several dimensions using
the most liquid single name 5-year CDS of the components of the leading market
indexes, iTraxx (European firms) and CDX (US firms). First we look at their basic
statistical properties. Then we address two specific issues: (i) the factors explaining the
divergences from the common trend among different CDS quoted spreads, and (ii) the
relative informational advantage of the prices coming from different CDS databases.
A summary of our results follows. As one can expect, the overall average trend is
usually similar among databases but we find, somewhat unexpectedly, that there are
systematic departures across databases from the common trend. In fact, if we restrict the
comparison to the days in which we have observations in all the data sources
simultaneously (both trades and quotes), we find that for European firms before the
crisis, there is price information on trades in 35% of the days and, perhaps not
coincidentally, there is, on average, a considerable degree of agreement among the
prices provided by the different databases, although some differences can still be found
at the individual (reference entity) level. During the crisis, there is price information on
trades in 15% of the days, the average prices are relatively alike among databases but
some striking differences appear at individual level and in specific time periods.

4

For US firms before the crisis, when there are recorded transactions prices from GFI on
15% of the days, average spreads are roughly similar across databases but again some
differences persist at firm level. However during the crisis, the percentage of days with
information from GFI on transaction prices is only 2%, and we find that average spreads
widen across databases, and also there is a remarkable lack of agreement at the
individual level. In summary, as was also the case with European firms, when there is
enough information on transaction prices databases tend to agree among them. However
during the crisis, US firms’ CDS spreads from different databases diverge to a larger
extent than before the crisis. This fact implies that as the information on transaction
prices become scarcer, prices from different sources tend to diverge from the common
trend. The most extreme disagreements are in the case of American firms during the
crisis, when there is a drastic reduction in the availability of transaction prices from
GFI. This lack of recorded transaction prices could be due to the fact that the CDS
market in the US is based to some extent on voice transactions and to a lower extent in
inter-dealer broker platforms such as GFI or perhaps, to the use of other platforms
instead of GFI.

If we restrict the comparison to the days in which we have no trades and simultaneous
quotes in the corresponding data sources, we find that for European firms before the
crisis, there is, again, a fairly large degree of agreement among the prices provided by
the different databases. During the crisis, the average prices are similar among databases
with some individual exceptions for specific entities and time periods. For US entities
before the crisis, average spreads are similar across databases but again some
differences persist at individual level. However during the crisis, we find that average

5

spreads are less alike, volatility increases, and also there is surprisingly high variation in
average quotes for the same reference entities coming from different databases.

In summary the preliminary analysis shows that, although the different CDS quotes
moved broadly in the same direction, there are very noticeable divergences for some
entities in some days. Also, the discrepancies among databases appear to be more
marked in specific time periods, probably reflecting market turbulences but it is
important to remark that no single database provides quotes that are consistently above
or below the quotes from other databases. We also find evidence suggesting that on
average the days without trade information have higher quote dispersion than the days
with trade price information.

Most importantly, deviations (in absolute value) from the common trend among the
different CDS quoted spreads are not purely random, but are related to idiosyncratic
factors like firm size and also to liquidity, global risk and trading factors. We also find
that the different data sources do not reflect credit risk information equally efficiently.
Our results suggest that the CMA quoted CDS spreads led the credit risk price
discovery process with respect to the quotes provided by other databases. All these
results are robust to potential endogeneity or multicollinearity problems and to different
econometric methodologies.
Our results have a number of important implications for empirical research using CDS
prices. First, for US names with low trade frequency, our results cast doubts on the
reliability of the existing price information because there are very few recorded trade
prices in GFI. Thus, conclusions obtained in papers that have used these data are open,
to some extent, to criticism on these grounds. Second, in studies of price discovery of

6

the CDS market in relation to other markets such as bonds or futures, empirical results
may change depending on the database employed. In particular since there is a data
source (CMA) which seems to lead the others. For instance, Zhu (2006) using Markit
data found that the CDS market and the bond market appear to be equally important in
the incorporation of new information. Would this result hold if CMA data is used
instead of Markit data? Third, the smaller the firm, the lower the market’s liquidity and,
the highest the VIX volatility index, the larger are the deviations from the common
trend in prices across the different databases, and therefore, the less reliable and
comparable research results might be.
This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents a literature review. Section 3
describes the data employed in the analysis. Section 4 motivates the research hypotheses
and introduces the methodology. Section 5 shows the empirical results while Section 6
confirms the robustness of the results and presents some extensions. Section 7
concludes.

2. Literature Review
The importance of comparing alternative financial databases is stressed in the classical
papers by Rosenberg and Houglet (1974) and Bennin (1980) on the differences between
CRSP and COMPUSTAT stock price data. However, in more recent times there are
very few papers comparing databases. Schoar (2002) and Villalonga (2004) compare
COMPUSTAT with the Longitudinal Research Database and the Business Information
Tracking Series from the U.S Bureau of the Census, respectively, and show that
different data sources have large impact on the answers to research questions. Despite
the widespread use of CDS databases and the high relevance of their accuracy, to the

7

best of our knowledge there exists no study that examines or compares data as well as
databases. Our paper is a first attempt to fill this gap in the literature.
The first papers that compare, at least to some extent, different CDS data sources are
Nashikkar and Subrahmanyam (2007) and Nashikkar, Subrahmanyam, and Mahanti
(2009). However, this comparison is not the main focus of their paper and these authors
do not present a detailed analysis. They simply conduct a test to ensure consistency
between the CMA and GFI CDS spreads series over a short period when there was an
overlap between the two series. They develop this test just to match GFI and CMA
series and create a longer dataset given that they have the two data sources for different
periods. Moreover, they do not report any results of the tests and simply state that they
find consistency.
Mayordomo, Peña and Romo (2009) employ four different data sources (GFI, CMA,
Reuters EOD and JP Morgan) to study the existence of arbitrage opportunities in credit
derivatives markets focusing their attention to the single names CDSs and asset swaps.
Although they find similar results employing any of the four previous data sources at
the aggregate level, some differences appear at the individual reference entity level.
They report their base results using the GFI’s traded CDSs but when they use the other
data sources they do not find exactly the same number of arbitrage opportunities. That
is, for some individual firms they find arbitrage opportunities using GFI but they do not
find them using some of the other data sources. In some other cases they also find the
opposite.
The Mayordomo et al. (2009) study above suggests that the differences in CDS prices
from different databases can have a material influence on research results and therefore
a careful analysis of the publicly accessible databases is called for. In fact, the problem

8

could be potentially even more serious when researchers work with “unique” databases
coming from a single dealer’s quotes (contributor) and without crosschecking. It is
important to emphasize that we use a broad array of CDS data sources where, for most
of them, prices are put together based on information provided by several market traders
and dealers. Using aggregate prices we focus on the market factors or characteristics
that could affect the consistency among quoted prices. Thus, instead of using individual
dealer’s prices we use aggregated (composite/consensus) prices which allow us to have
a more comprehensive perspective on the market.
The only previous paper that employs different CDS prices (trades and quotes) is Arora,
Gandhi and Longstaff (2010). They examine how counterparty credit risk affects the
pricing of CDS contracts using a proprietary data set. Specifically, their data set spans
from March 2008 to January 2009 and includes contemporaneous CDS transaction
prices and quotations provided by 14 large CDS dealers for selling protection on the
same set of underlying reference firms. The authors find that there are differences across
dealers in how counterparty credit risk is priced. That is, counterparty credit risk is not
priced symmetrically across dealers and they consider that these asymmetries could be
due to differences in the microstructure and legal framework of the CDS market. They
argue that dealers may behave strategically in terms of their offers to sell credit
protection.
We use aggregate data, which are formed after grouping the information of the market
traders and dealers instead of individual dealer prices, to study the potential divergence
among the composite CDS spreads. By concentrating on the aggregate prices we focus
on the market factors or characteristics that could affect the consistency among quoted
prices but we do not try to explain the effect of potential differences among the
individual dealers. As Arora, et al. (2010) sustain, the decentralized nature of the CDS
9

markets makes the transaction prices somewhat difficult to observe. This is why most
empirical research analyses based on the CDS markets use price quotes instead of
transaction prices.

Longstaff, Mithal, and Neis (2005) argue that the composite prices include quotations
from a variety of credit derivatives dealers and therefore, these quotations should be
representative of the entire credit derivatives market. We complement our analysis using
also GFI transaction prices and Fenics prices (elaborated by GFI) which are based on a
combination of transaction and judgmental prices, the latter computed using the Hull
and White methodology and therefore not dependent on contributors.2

3. Data
The six publicly available data sources that we employ in this paper are GFI, Fenics,
Reuters EOD, CMA, Markit and JP Morgan. As was mentioned above, the first five
databases are analyzed jointly and JP Morgan data is employed additionally as a
robustness test for the European firms given that we do not have JP Morgan data for the
American firms.
•

GFI, which provides traded CDS spreads, is a major inter-dealer broker (IDB)
specializing in the trading of credit derivatives. GFI data contain single name
CDS transaction prices for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years maturities. They are not
consensus or indicative prices.3 Thus, these prices are an accurate indication of
where the CDS markets traded and closed for a given day. GFI data have been

2

As explained in Section 3, we also use an additional single sources data (JP Morgan). JP Morgan data
refer to individual dealer’s prices and we use them in the robustness analysis.
3
Consensus and indicative data are trusted less nowadays given the increased market’s volatility. There
exist differences of up to 100% between consensus prices from leading providers compared to actual
trades on GFI systems. The reason is that consensus process is inherently slow and the prices originate
from back office staff which can be swayed by the positions they already hold in their books, and also
perhaps because they do not have a front office’s market view.

used by Hull, Predescu, and White (2004), Predescu (2006), Saita (2006),
Nashikkar and Subrahmanyam (2007), Fulop and Lescourret (2007), or
Nashikkar, Subrahmanyam, and Mahanti (2009) among others.
•

Fenics (elaborated by GFI) data are a mixture of traded, quoted and estimated
CDS spreads. Fenics’ data are credit curves for the whole term structure of
maturities, generated hourly (all trading days) for more than 1900 reference
entities. Data points in a given name’s credit curve can be actual trades or mid
prices calculated from the bid/offer quotes. If there are no market references, the
Fenics CDS spread is computed using the Hull and White methodology to
ensure that a credit curve always exists for each reference entity.4 Fenics data
have been used in Mayordomo et al. (2009) among others5.

•

Reuters EOD provides CDS composite prices. Reuters takes CDS quotes each
day from over 30 contributors around the world and offers end of day data for
single names CDSs. Before computing a daily composite spread, it applies a
rigorous screening procedure to eliminate outliers or doubtful data. Mayordomo
et al. (2009), among others, employ CDSs data from Reuters.

•

Credit Market Analytics (CMA) DataVision reports consensus data (bid, ask and
mid) sourced from 30 buy-side firms, including major global Investment Banks,
Hedge Funds, and Asset Managers. Among the papers that employ CMA data
are Nashikkar and Subrahmanyam (2007) and Nashikkar, Subrahmanyam, and
Mahanti (2009).

4

Although Fenics is computed using the approximations mentioned above, it is a reasonably accurate
data source. For instance, the median of the absolute difference in basis points between five years CDS
premiums as defined by Fenics and the actual quotes or transaction prices registered in other databases for
the period between April 2001 and May 2002, is equal to 1.16, 2.01 and 3.82 bps for AAA/AA, A and
BBB ratings for a total of 2,659, 9,585 and 8,170 companies respectively.
5
GFI is a broker which also reports the Fenics prices. The data reported by GFI are transactions prices or
bid/quotes in which capital is actually committed. This data is only available when there is a trade. When
there is not, GFI constructs the Fenics curve which is available daily with no gaps. To compute the Fenics
curve, GFI uses its own information on transactions or quotes. If for a given day neither prices nor quotes
are available, Fenics data is computed by means of Hull and White’s methodology.

11

•

Markit provides composite prices. The Markit Group collects more than a
million CDS quotes contributed by more than 30 major market participants on a
daily basis. The quotes are subject to filtering that removes outliers and stale
observations. Markit then computes a daily composite spread only if it has two
or more contributors. Once Markit starts pricing a CDS contract, data will be
available on a continuous basis, although there may be missing observations in
the data. Markit is one of the most widely employed dataset. Papers that employ
this dataset include: Acharya and Johnson (2007), Zhang, Zhou and Zhu (2009),
Jorion and Zhang (2007), Jorian and Zhang (200), Zhu (2006), Micu et al.
(2004), and Cao, Yu, and Zhong (2010).

•

Our last database is J.P. Morgan quotes. It contains mid-market data provided by
J. P. Morgan which is one of the leading players and most active traders in the
CDS market. The data from J.P. Morgan is employed for a subgroup of
European firms as part of the robustness tests (data is not available for US
firms). This dataset is employed in Aunon-Nerin, Cossin, Hricko, and Huang
(2002), Blanco, Brennan, and Marsh (2005), and Chen, Cheng, and Liu (2008)
among others.

To summarize, three of the data sources (Reuters EOD, CMA and Markit) employ data
from a variety of contributors (over 30 potential dealers/traders) to report composite
prices. GFI reports traded CDS spreads. Fenics is a mixture of traded, quoted and
calculated CDS spreads all of them based on the same data source and without
depending on contributors. Finally, the last data source is obtained from one of the most
active traders in the CDS market (JP Morgan) and reports mid-quoted prices obtained

12

from their own traders. Thus, the information reported by Reuters EOD, CMA and
Markit could also include the information of JP Morgan’s quoted CDS spreads6.

For our analysis we use US firms included in the CDX index, as well as European firms
included in the iTraxx index. At any point in time, both the CDX and iTraxx indexes
contain 125 names each but the composition of the indexes changes every six months.
We do not use all the single names CDSs in these indexes but concentrate on the most
liquid single names CDSs. As in Christoffersen, Ericsson, Jacobs, and Xisong (2009)
we use only the single name CDSs which constitute the iTraxx and CDX indexes over
the whole sample period which spans from January 2004 to March 2010. We end up
with 47 (43) firms which stay in the iTraxx (CDX) index during the whole sample
period and for which we are able to obtain equity price information7. We guarantee a
minimum consistency between the single name CDS spread obtained from the different
data sources by requiring that all of them have the same maturity (5-year), currency
denomination (Euros for the European and US Dollars for the American CDSs),
seniority (senior CDS spreads), and restructuring clause (Modified-Modified
Restructuring for the European and Modified Restructuring for the American CDSs).

6
CMA and GFI span from January 1, 2004 to March 29, 2010 for all firms. Markit spans from January 1,
2004 to December 8, 2009 for all firms. Fenics spans from January 1, 2004 to June 3, 2009 for most of
the firms and from January 1, 2004 to March 29, 2010 in the remaining seven firms. Reuters spans from
December 3, 2007 to March 29, 2010. JP Morgan spans from January 1, 2005 to August 13, 2009. For
this reason, in the robustness test in which we add JP Morgan data we limit the length of our sample from
January 1, 2005 to August 13, 2009 to focus in the cases in which we have observations from JP Morgan.
7
It could be argued that this selection procedure could introduce some survivorship bias in our sample. It
should be noted that the components of the indexes are investment grade CDSs firms which are the most
actively traded names in the six months prior to the index roll. If in a given period a single name CDS is
excluded from the index it is not necessary due to the fact that the firm enters financial distress but simply
because of liquidity reasons. On the other hand if a name is downgraded to non-investment it is, of
course, excluded from the index. Notice however that one should expect that the agreement among
databases on the CDS price for a given name should be higher for the most liquid names. Thus, this
possible survivorship bias will tend to make the prices from different databases more in agreement than
they are in fact. Consequently if we find significant disagreement among prices from different sources,
the empirical evidence is even more compelling.

13

As we said before, two price time series for the same financial instrument reported by
different data sources should, in principle, be very close. To provide a telling illustration
that this is not necessarily the case for CDS contracts, Figure 1 depicts 5-year CDS
quotes from Reuters, Fenics, Markit and CMA for two European entities (AXA and
Hannover) and for two US entities (Baxter and Dominion Resources). The sample
period is from September 1, 2008 to January 1, 2009. Four notable features emerge
from the figures (which can be deemed as typical behavior for firms over this time
period). First, although the different CDS quotes moved broadly in the same direction,
there are very noticeable divergences in a given day. For instance on October 10, 2008
the following quotes for AXA were reported: CMA 247 b.p., Markit 229 b.p., Fenics
193 b.p. and Reuters 191 b.p., implying a difference around 30% between the highest
and the lowest quote. Similar disagreements can be observed in the other three entities.
Second, the discrepancies among databases appear to be more marked in specific time
periods, probably reflecting market turbulences.

The first week of October 2008

(Dominion, Hannover, AXA) or the first week of December 2009 (Baxter) is a case in
point. Third, no single database provides quotes that are consistently above or below the
quotes from other databases. Fourth, the speed of adjustment to market news is not the
same across databases as the case of Dominion at the end of September 2008 or the case
of Hannover at mid-October 2008 suggest. In both cases, the Fenics quotes reacted to
market events in a different way than the other three databases.
Table 1 shows the main descriptive statistics for the single name CDS of the firms that
we study, for the first five databases: GFI, Fenics, Reuters EOD, CMA, and Markit. We
report statistics on Number of Trades or Quotes, Number of Trades or Quotes per day,
Mean, Standard Deviation, Median, Skewness and Kurtosis of the CDS spreads as well

14

as the coefficient of the AR(1) based on the CDS spreads. In Panel A we report the
names classified by index and sector for both the American and European firms.

Panels B, C, D, E, and F, provide the CDS descriptive statistics for the European single
name CDSs. The information is divided for the periods before and during the financial
crisis to make easier potential comparisons among data sources in these two periods.
Each of the five previous panels corresponds to a different data source. Panel B reports
the CDS traded spreads information obtain from GFI while Panels C, D, E, and F
provide the information obtain from CMA, Markit, Fenics, and Reuters EOD,
respectively. Before the crisis there is price information on trades in 35% of the days
and there is, on average, a considerable degree of agreement among the prices provided
by the different databases. The asymmetry is always positive and there is a high degree
of persistence with first order autocorrelation coefficient near one in all cases. However
there are a few cases where some noteworthy differences can be found.

During the crisis however there is information on transaction prices only in 15% of the
days. The skewness is usually positive but there are some noticeable differences in
persistence: GFI prices are clearly less persistent (0.83) than the quotes from the other
databases. In fact, all the names which trade less than the 10% of the days have firstorder autocorrelation coefficients around 0.6. One important implication of this is that
unit root test based on an AR(1) specification will tend to give different results,
rejecting non-stationarity for GFI data (especially in the cases of low trade frequency
names) but not rejecting it for the other databases. The discrepancies, even in the cases
in which a comparable number of observations across the different data sources are
available, are much more frequent and more remarkable as the cases of PPR, Volvo,

15

Enel and some others suggest. Specifically, in the case of Volvo there is a difference of
33 b. p. between the highest average price (Reuters, 253b.p.) and the lowest (CMA, 220
b.p.). Other discrepancies are found even between the datasets (CMA and Markit) with
more similar quotes, as in the cases of PPR (16 b.p.) and Enel (9 b.p.).
Panels G, H, I, J, and K, provide the CDS descriptive statistics for the American single
name CDSs. As in the European case, the information is divided for the periods before
and during the crisis. Panel G reports the information obtained from GFI while Panels
H, I, J, and K provide the information obtain from CMA, Markit, Fenics, and Reuters
EOD, respectively. Before the crisis there is price information on trades in 15% of the
days and there is, on average, a fair amount of agreement among the prices provided by
the different databases. The skewness is always positive but with a fair degree of
variation from 0.72 for Fenics to 0.06 for GFI. In all cases there is a high degree of
persistence with first order autocorrelation coefficient near one. However, as is the case
with European firms, there are a few names with a relatively similar number of
observations where some salient differences can be found. Before the crisis, Cigna’s
CDS quoted spreads obtained from Fenics are more than 30% higher than CMA and
Markit quotes. On the other hand, General Electric’s CDS spreads obtained from Fenics
are 62% lower than the ones obtained from CMA and Markit.

Transaction prices are only available in 2% of the days during the crisis, and the
discrepancies are both more frequent and more remarkable. For instance in the case of
American International Group there is a difference of 111 b.p. between the Reuters
quote (825 b.p.) and the CMA quote (714 b.p.) and 80 b.p. between the Reuters quote
(815 b.p.) and the Markit quote (745 b.p.). Other notable disagreements between the
highest and the lowest prices in names with a relatively similar number of observations

16

across the different data sources are found for Comcast (the average difference between
Markit and Reuters CDS spreads is 61 b.p.), General Electric (the average difference
between CMA and Reuters is 34 b.p.), and XL Capital (the average difference between
CMA and Reuters is 57 b.p. and between CMA and Markit 34 b.p.), among others. The
GFI transaction data is less persistent than the quoted prices from the other databases.
Therefore, the implications for unit root test also apply to US entities. In summary, the
preliminary analysis suggests that the crisis has had a strong effect on the degree of
disagreement of the different databases in several individual reference entities, and
especially so for US names

As the actual sample size of the different data sources differ (because of missing values
and slightly different periods covered), we report aggregated summary statistics for all
observations in Panel L, in Panel M for the cases in which we have common
observations (trades and quotes) in all the data sources, and in Panel N for the cases in
which there is no trade but there are quotes in all the data sources. The implications one
may gather from these panels are relevant for assessing the degree of databases’ overall
agreement in the common average trend. As expected, for European firms before the
crisis the common trend is readily apparent in the prices provided by the different
databases in the three panels. During the crisis, there are some discrepancies in the
average values and in the volatilities in Panel L. In Panels M and N there are few
discrepancies but it is interesting to remark that averages and volatilities are lower in
Panel M than in Panel N suggesting that average quotes tend to be higher and more
volatile in the days where there are no transaction prices available.
For US firms before the crisis the common trend is also readily apparent. However
during the crisis, there are many quite remarkable discrepancies in the average values

17

and in the volatilities in Panel L. In Panels M and N there are also discrepancies but it is
worth noting that, as it was also the case with the European firms, averages and
volatilities are lower in Panel M than in Panel N reinforcing the above suggestion that
average quotes tend to be higher and more volatile in the days where there are no
transaction prices available.
We should emphasize that the total aggregate descriptive statistics across all the firms,
which are reported in Panels L, M and N, do not provide information about potential
discrepancies at the individual reference entity level or in a given date. That is, although
the total averages are in most cases fairly close, there could be some noteworthy
discrepancies both at the entity (as the preliminary analysis above suggest) and also at
the cross-sectional level that cannot be captured by these statistics.

To clarify this point, we first compute the absolute value of the average difference
across pairs of data sources8 (CMA - Markit, CMA - Fenics, CMA - Reuters, Markit Fenics, Markit - Reuters, Fenics – Reuters) and then divide it by the average CDS
spread across the four previous data sources (CMA, Markit, Fenics, and Reuters) for
each firm every day. Then, we calculate the average of the previous series every day
across the total number of firms. This is the Data Sources’ Average Absolute
Discrepancies (AAD) time series. The AAD time series is shown in Figure 2 for days
with trades (Trade) and for days without trades (No Trade). The average value of Trade
is 0.031 and its volatility is 0.021. The average value of No Trade is 0.053 and its
volatility is 0.017. The two sample unpooled t-test with unequal variances has a tstatistic of 33.68 under the null of equal means, suggesting that on average the days
without trade information have higher quote dispersion. The AAD series show a very

dynamic behaviour, with some noticeably turbulent episodes, for instance in 2005 given
the impact of the crisis experienced by General Motors (GM) and Ford in May 2005 on
the credit default swap (CDS) market. Both firms’ CDS premia increased sharply just
before the downgrading of their credit ratings in May 2005. All other CDS premia also
rose markedly during this period for US and European firms. The more salient episodes
in the AAD series are in September 2008 in the days surrounding the Lehman Brothers
collapse when the AAD took its highest value to date (10%). In summary the data
suggest that discrepancies from the common trend among databases are persistent and
related with market-wide significant episodes. We address the modelling of these
discrepancies in Section 4.

Additionally, in Panels O and P of Table 1 we report the unit root test for all CDS
names in our sample, computed using the quotes time series whenever we have quotes
in the four data sources (CMA, Markit, Fenics, and Reuters EOD) at the same time.9

Table 2 reports summary statistics for the distribution of the quoted and the traded CDS
spreads referencing the firms in Table 1. Panel A provides the distribution of the
number of quoted spreads on a given day for a single name CDS through the four data
sources (CMA, Markit, Reuters and Fenics). Panel B reports the distribution of the
range of the mean absolute difference, in basis points, among all the possible pairs of
quoted spreads from the previous data sources on a given day for a single CDS. Panel C
provides the distribution of the range of the mean absolute difference, in basis points,
between all the possible pairs formed by the GFI traded CDS spread and one of the

9

We do not report the unit root test for GFI given the low number of observations available, which limits
the comparison among the quoted CDS spreads which include more observations than the traded ones,
and also due the consequent test’s low power, see Shiller and Perron (1985). Actually, in the US sample
we cannot test the existence of a unit root due to lack of trades.

19

different quoted CDS spreads. In almost 80% of the cases we observe the CDS spread
on a given firm at least in three different data sources. The mean absolute difference
among the different data sources is higher than one basis point in 55.3% of the cases
and it is higher than five basis points in 13.3% of the cases. The mean absolute
difference among the traded CDS spread on one hand and the quoted CDS on the other
hand (Panel C of Table 2) is slightly higher than the mean differences observed in Panel
B of Table 2. Actually the mean difference is smaller than one basis point in 40.9% of
the cases.

4. Research Hypotheses and Methodology
The main analysis of the data is based on two testable hypotheses. These hypotheses
and the methodology employed to perform the empirical tests are detailed in this
section.
Hypothesis 1: The volatility of the deviations from the common trend of the quoted
prices provided by the different CDS data sources is not related to systematic factors.
In other words, large deviations (in absolute value) from the common trend appear
randomly among databases and are unrelated with risk and liquidity factors (global or
idiosyncratic). The test of Hypothesis 1 is based on a regression in which the dependent
variable is the logarithm of the standard deviation of the 5-year quoted CDS spreads
reported by the different data sources which is denoted by log(sd(CDS))i,t This variable
is computed with the j available CDS quoted spreads (j = 1,..,4 where 1= CMA, 2 =
Markit, 3 = Reuters and 4 = Fenics) for a given underlying firm i (i = 1,..,90) on every
n

n

date t as follows: log( sd (CDS )) i ,t = log((1 / n∑ [CDS j ,i ,t − (1 / n ∑ CDS j ,i ,t )] 2 ) 0.5 ) where
,
j =1
j =1

20

n is the number of data sources from which we observe CDS spreads, with the
maximum n equal four whenever CMA, Markit, Reuters and Fenics report the CDS
spreads for firm i at time t.
By defining the dependent variable in this way10 we get rid of the common trend (the
average) and concentrate on the deviations from the common trend. The regression
equation is as follows:

log(sd (CDS))i ,t = α + β ′X k ,i ,t + ui ,t

(1)

where the vector X k ,i ,t includes k explanatory variables: the logarithm of the firm
market capitalization, a trade dummy, the number of days without a trade, the
interaction of the number of days without a trade one day ago and the trade dummy , the
CDS bid-ask spread, the VIX Index and a number of databases dummy.11 The vector
β ′ includes the regression coefficients corresponding to these k variables while the

parameter α is the intercept of the regression. The residual term is denoted by ui,t . The
trade dummy is equal to one if there is a trade in the GFI platform at the current date in
the 5-year maturity contract, and zero otherwise. 12 The number of days without a trade
variable measures the number of days without a trade up to the current date. The
interaction variable is constructed as the interaction between the number of days without
a transaction up to one day ago and the trade dummy. The last variable intends to give
an indication about how many data points were used to compute the dependent variable
and is a dummy which equals one when all, or all minus one, of the data sources report
10

We take logs to induce the data to meet the assumptions of the regression method that is to be applied;
because the distribution of the standard deviation variable is strongly right skewed (the skewness of the
original series is 25.10 while the skewness of the log series is 0.21).
11
Hausman’s test rejects the random effects specification in favor of a fixed-effects specification,
with a p-value of 0.05.
12
We are considering trades for the 5-year maturity contract only given that the number of trades in the
other maturity contracts is very low. The total number of trades according to GFI information during the
sample period and for the firms that we consider is 26,126 while the number of trades which occurred in
the other maturities (1 and 3 years contracts) is 1,100 confirming that the most liquid contract is the 5year CDS contract.

a price.13 If the null hypothesis is true no significant coefficients should be found in
equation (1) because differences in price dispersion between databases should be purely
random.

Hypothesis 2: The different data sources reflect credit risk information equally
efficiently or, equivalently, all databases contribute equally to the price discovery
process. Given that transaction prices are very scarce for some firms, only quoted prices
are employed and therefore the comparison is among CMA, Markit, Fenics and Reuters.
To test Hypothesis 2 we employ the Gonzalo and Granger’s (1995) model which is
based on the following Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) specification and it is
used to study the effectiveness of the different data sources in terms of price discovery:
p

ΔX t = αβ ′X t −1 + ∑ Γi ΔX t −i + ut

(3)

i =1

where equation (3) is formed by a vector autoregressive (VAR) system formed by two
equations defined from the vector Xt which includes a pair of CDS quotes or prices of
the same underlying firm from two different databases and an error correction term
which is defined by the product β ′X t −1 where β’ = (1− β2 − β3 ) are estimated in an
auxiliary cointegration regression. The series for the pair of CDS prices included in X t −1
must be cointegrated to develop this analysis and the cointegrating relation is defined by
β ′X t −1 = ( CDS SOURCE

A ,t −1

− β 2 − β 3CDS SOURCE

B ,t −1

) which can be interpreted as the long-

run equilibrium. The parameter vector α’ =(α1 , α2 ) contains the error correction
coefficients measuring each price’s expected speed in eliminating the price difference
and it is the base of the price discovery metrics. The parameter vector Γi for i= 1,..p,
13

We do not employ values from zero to four given that we only have observations on Reuters EOD after
December 2007 which is very close to the beginning of the crisis and may reflect something different to
what we want to study in this paper.

22

with p indicating the total number of lags, contains the coefficients of the VAR system
measuring the effect of the lagged first difference in the pair of CDS quotes on the first
different of such quotes at time t.14

Finally, ut denotes a white noise vector. The

percentages of price discovery of the CDS quote i (where i =1, 2) can be defined from
the following metrics GGi, i=1,2 which are based on the elements of the vector α’:
GG1 =

α2
;
− α1 + α 2

GG 2 =

− α1
− α1 + α 2

( 4)

The vector α’ contains the coefficients that determine each market’s contribution to
price discovery. Thus, given that GG1+GG2=1 we conclude that market 1 leads the
process of price discovery with respect to market 2 whenever market 1 price discovery
metric GG1 is higher than 0.5. If the null hypothesis is true (no dominant market) the
percentage of price discovery will be the same for the names from all databases and
equal to 0.5. We estimate the price discovery metric for each firm using pairs of CDS
spreads and then test whether the average price discovery metric is significantly higher
than 0.5 using the mean t-statistic: Mean t − stat =

( Mean ( PDMetrics ) − 0 .5)
,
Std . Dev ( PDMetrics ) / # metrics

where # metrics denotes the number of firms for which it is estimated the price
discovery metric from a given pair of CDS spreads.

5. Empirical Results
5.1 Regression Results: Hypothesis 1
Table 3 reports the average time-series correlations among dependent and explanatory
variables in equation (1). The variables with a highest correlation with the dependent
variable are the CDS bid-ask spread (0.414) and the VIX Index (0.456). The highest
14

The optimal number of lags is determined by means of the Schwarz information criteria.

23

correlation among explanatory variables is also the one between the CDS bid-ask spread
and the VIX Index (0.480). Our main objective, however, is to examine the joint effect
of these explanatory variables on the dispersion among the CDS spreads obtained from
the different data sources.

Table 4 shows the regression results obtained from fitting equation (1) to data from the
five databases. Column 1 reports the results for the whole sample whereas Column 2
reports the results for European firms and Column 3 for US firms. Negative and
significant coefficients for the explanatory variable measuring size (log (market cap))
are found suggesting that the CDS prices for large firms tend to be more in agreement
among databases than the prices for small firms. Or in other words, the volatility of the
deviations from the common trend is lower for large firms. This effect is also noticeably
stronger for US firms. The coefficients for the explanatory dummy variable “trade” are
negative and significant suggesting that when there are transaction prices available for a
given day, the quotes from different contributors tend to agree more closely. This is in
agreement with the results on basic statistical properties summarized in the Section 5.1
above. Consequently, the positive (but only significant for US firms) effect found for
the variable days w/o trade implies that the longer the period without transaction price
information, the greater the disagreement among quotes because, the weaker is the
referential value of the previous price. The interaction between the trade dummy and
the number of days without a trade one day ago has a negative sign (but non-significant
for European firms) indicating that the effect of the trade is more influential when the
number of days without price trade information is larger.15

15
One possible explanation is that traders will pay more attention to the new information reported by GFI
when there has been no recorded trading activity for some time.

24

Regarding the liquidity variable, the bid-ask spread, has, as expected, positive and
significant coefficients implying that the more illiquid is the market, the more difficult
is to infer appropriate prices and the higher are the deviations from the common trend
among the different data sources. The effect of the VIX index is positive and significant.
The higher the global risk, the higher the dispersion from the common trend among
individual CDS spreads. 16, 17
The dummy variable Max Quotes is equal to one when at least three data sources report
a price and zero otherwise. The intuition is that the higher the number of quotes
employed to calculate the cross-sectional standard deviation, the higher should this
standard deviation be. This variable is significant and has a positive sign as expected.

To summarize, the empirical evidence strongly rejects Hypothesis 1. The volatility of
the deviations from the common trend of the quoted prices provided by the different
CDS data sources is not random but related to systematic factors. In other words, large
deviations (in absolute value) from the common trend among databases do not appear
randomly but are significantly related with risk and liquidity factors. The economic
implication of this result is that, in specific market circumstances, the deviations of the
prices from the common trend will tend to grow on average. Some prices will be closer
to the trend and some prices will be far away from it but the average distance between
them will increase, making the prices less homogeneous and making it more difficult
for agents to asses the CDS fair value and for researcher using the data to decide what
database gives the market prices’ most reliable account. Also, model (1) does a pretty
16
These variables should not cause any collinearity problem given that the correlation is 0.480. However,
we further investigate this aspect and others regarding potential endogeneity problems derived from the
use of the VIX and CDS liquidity variables in the robustness test section.
17
Our results do not change materially when we proxy the global risk measure by means of the VDAX
Index, the difference between LIBOR and Treasury Bill, the CDS indexes (iTraxx and CDX) or the
square of the MSCI Index returns instead of the VIX index.

25

good job in explaining the dispersion among prices for the overall sample as measured
by the R2 (48%), and also for the European (37%) and US (46%) samples.18
As the bulk of the CDS spreads that we employ in our analysis are based on the
information revealed by the traders or dealers, it is possible that the degree of
divergence among the different data sources may be influenced by the number of
contributors which are reporting quoted or traded CDS spreads. In an extreme case in
which all the composite prices are constructed using the same group of contributors, the
prices should be very similar and the volatility of the deviations from the common trend
should be close to zero. The problem is that we do not have access to the identity of the
contributors that are reporting prices to the different data sources. However, we have
access to the number of contributors that are reporting prices to Markit for the 5-year
CDS spread. The different data sources may have different contributors but there should
be some common group of contributors which presumably are the most influential
traders and for that reason the most active agents in terms of contributed prices.
Moreover, there could be other contributors whose participation is less significant in the
sense that they report prices less frequently, or they could report prices to a few data
sources but not to the others. This could imply that when the number of contributors is
small the prices might be provided by the most influential and active traders which, on
the other hand, could be common to all the data sources. Therefore, we conjecture that
the lower the number of contributors, the higher should be the importance of the
common contributors and the lower the divergence from the common trend among the
different data sources. To test this conjecture we include the variable “number of
18
We also performed separate analysis before and during the crisis. We find that the explanatory
variables referred to the trades are not significant before the crisis but they are significant and with the
same signs as reported in Table 4 for the crisis period. We also considered the use of a crisis dummy but
since the liquidity is much lower during the crisis and the number of trades in US is much lower during
that period the use of the crisis dummy may cloud the effect of some of the potential explanatory
variables that we use. Moreover, we use the VIX as a potential proxy for times of financial distress

26

contributors” as an additional explanatory variable in equation (1) and run the
corresponding regression. The results are shown in Column (2) of Table 5; Column (1)
repeats the benchmark results from Table 4 for comparison purposes. The coefficient on
the number of contributors is positive and significant which is consistent with our
conjecture on the effect of the number of contributors. The coefficients for the
remaining variables do not change materially in sign or in magnitude with respect to the
ones obtained in the baseline regression (Column (1) of Table 5).
To test if these results are affected by possible collinearity due to the relatively high
correlation between both the CDS bid-ask spread and the VIX Index with the number of
contributors (-0.212 and -0.361, respectively) we repeat the previous regression but
using as explanatory variable the residual of the regression of the number of
contributors onto the VIX Index and the CDS bid-ask spread. The residual proxies the
number of contributors net of the global risk and the illiquidity effect in the CDS
market. These results are shown in Column (3) of Table 5.19 The results are almost
identical to the ones observed in Column (2) and consistent with our conjecture on the
effect of the most relevant contributors, and also that collinearity between the three
previous variables is not a serious issue in our case.
It should be mentioned that transactions are not necessarily made through the GFI
platform, but they could occur in any other platform. The advantage of GFI data is not
that it includes all the CDS contracts traded but that it is a transparent source in which
the market participants can observe real transaction prices and not just quotes. Although
there is no available data for all the transaction prices since the beginning of our whole
sample, we can employ an additional information source for a shorter time period;

19
In order to estimate the coefficients presented in Column (3) of Table 5 we use the bootstrap
methodology to correct any potential bias in the standard errors due to the use of a generated regressor.

27

namely, a “trade information warehouse” that captures the majority of information on
CDS trades covering corporate and sovereign borrowers. This warehouse is established
by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) which keeps a record of
outstanding CDSs involving major dealers as counterparties. According to the DTCC
calculations around 90-95% of the CDS trades are settled and confirmed through them.
The DTCC does not provide all the trade details, which are private information, but it
reports weekly data on the gross and net exposures and the number of CDS outstanding
contracts on 1,000 corporate and sovereign borrowers. We have this weekly information
for the 90 firms that constitute our sample from the 7th of November, 2008 to the last
sample date (the 29th of March, 2010).
To test for the importance of trades in the deviations of the CDS prices, we substitute
the trading controls employed in equation (1) by a weekly variable which reports the
total number of outstanding CDS contracts traded on a given reference firm. This allows
us to control for both the cumulative information on a given firm attending to the total
number of contracts and the trend in trading activity. The hypothesis to test is if a higher
number of CDS contacts traded on a given reference firm lowers the volatility of the
deviations from the common trend across data sources. We find that the total number of
CDS contracts traded on a reference firm has a significant and negative effect on the
dispersion between data sources while the sings and levels of significance of the other
variables remain unchanged with respect to the ones observed in the baseline regression
results (Column (1) of Table 4). The implication of this is that the higher the market
activity, the lower is the volatility of the deviations from the common trend of the
quoted prices provided by the different CDS data sources. This fact is obviously at odds
with Hypothesis 1 being true.

Additionally, given that we are employing daily

information but this variable is constructed on a weekly frequency, we lagged the

28

variable one week and obtain a significant negative coefficient on that variable while
the signs and the significance of the other variables remain unchanged. We also use the
number of weekly traded contracts, lagged one week, instead of the total number of
outstanding traded contracts and obtain similar results.20

5.3 Regression Results: Hypothesis 2
Table 6 reports the results of testing Hypothesis 2 on price discovery analysis using
quoted prices (transaction prices are too scarce to be included in the analysis). A
statistical significance test for the null hypothesis that the estimated price discovery
proportions GGi are equal to 0.5, is also included. The test rejects the null in all cases
with the exception of CMA vs Markit in Europe and Fenics vs Reuters also in Europe.
Therefore in these two cases both databases contribute equally to the price discovery
process. However, in all other cases the results indicate that there is a leader database
and a follower database. CMA is the data source that contributes to a higher extent to
the “formation of prices” with newer and more influential information, especially for
the total sample and for the US sample, followed by Markit. As mentioned above, for
European firms CMA and Markit are almost equally informative in terms of price
discovery. The less informative database in this realm seems to be Fenics. The results
strongly reject the hypothesis that the price discovery process is evenly spread among
data bases, and therefore Hypothesis 2 is not supported by the data.

6. Robustness Tests and Extensions
In this section, we report the results of several checks of the test of Hypothesis 1
presented in Table 4. First, we deal with potential problems of endogeneity and
20

29

multicollinearity. Second, we repeat the previous analysis for a sub sample of European
firms and adding a new data source: JP Morgan. Third, we consider alternative
econometric techniques: pooled regressions and Prais-Winsten regressions after filling
the missing observations. Finally, we analyze the sensitivity of the results to different
data transformations: (i) using as the dependent variable the ratio between the logarithm
of the standard deviation of the CDS quotes and the logarithm of mean CDS spread; (ii)
excluding first the Reuters EOD quotes and second the Fenics quotes; (iii) limiting the
sample period up to December 2009, June 2009 and December 2007;21 (iv) using single
source datasets constructed without aggregating data (Fenics/GFI and JPMorgan); and
(v) grouping the firms by sector.22

6.1. Multicollinearity and Endogeneity Tests
In order to deal with potential problems of multicollinearity and endogeneity derived
from the use of both the VIX and CDS bid-ask variables, we run a series of panel
regressions based on different variations of the baseline regression (1) whose results are
reported in Table 4. First, we run an identical panel regression but omitting the VIX
Index, the CDS bid-ask spread and both. The results, not presented to save space, are
qualitatively very similar to those in Column (1) of Table 4 confirming the significance
of the other explanatory variables and suggesting that endogeneity and collinearity are
not a serious issue in our case. As expected, the explanatory power of the panel
regressions is lower given that we are omitting two powerful explanatory variables: the
VIX Index and the CDS bid-ask spread.
21

These alternative sampling periods are used to test whether the results may contain some bias due to the
lack of observations in some data sources or due to the effect of the different rules for dealing with the
collateral in the CDS contracts. We limit the sample up to December 2009 and June 2009 because the
data obtained from Fenics and Markit are available up to such periods, respectively. We limit the sample
up to December 2007 to take into account potential differences in terms of the standard underlying
collateral which is used for the different data sources.
22
All the results of this section are available upon request.

30

As an additional test for potential endogeneity between the standard deviation between
the different data sources and the VIX and CDS bid-ask spread variables, we run a
regression in which we use a one period (day) lag in both variables. This is a standard
procedure to deal with potential endogeneity and we find similar results to the ones
reported in Column (1) of Table 4.
Finally, to test whether the results are biased by collinearity reasons due to the high
correlation between the bid-ask spread and the VIX we run regression (1) but instead of
the VIX Index using as explanatory variable the residual of the regression of the VIX
Index onto the bid-ask spread. The residual proxies the VIX net of the illiquidity effect
in the CDS market. We also run the regression but instead of the CDS bid-ask spread
using as explanatory variable the residual of the regression of the CDS bid-ask spread
onto the VIX Index. The residual proxies the illiquidity in the CDS market net of the
global risk effect. These results are reported in Columns (2) and (3) of Table 7 and they
are almost identical to those in Table 4, which are also reported in Column (1) of Table
7 for comparison. In order to estimate the coefficients presented in Columns (2) and (3)
of Table 7 we use the bootstrap methodology to correct any potential bias in the
standard errors due to the use of generated regressors. The results suggest that
collinearity between the two previous variables is not a serious issue in our case.
6.2. Adding a new data source
Our previous analysis is based on five different data sources (GFI, Fenics, CMA, Markit
and Reuters EOD). We did not employ the data from J.P. Morgan because data for US
firms was not available. However, for the sake of robustness we repeat the previous
analysis for the sub sample of European firms adding a new data source: JP Morgan.
These data was employed by Mayordomo et al. (2009) in the analysis of arbitrage

31

opportunities in the credit derivatives markets. This new analysis is developed attending
to the sample length of JP Morgan, that is, we use observations from January 1, 2005 to
August 13, 2009 for the different data sources.

First we run regression (1) but including the data for JP Morgan and find similar results
to those in Column (2) of Table 4 for the European firms. If we also include variable for
the number of contributors, its effect on the dependent variable is also positive. The
lower the number of contributors, the lower is the discrepancy among the different data
sources. We also find that collinearity and endogeneity are not a serious issue in our
case.
Finally, we repeat the price discovery analysis for the six data sources and find that the
CMA database leads the price discovery process with respect all other databases,
including JP Morgan. The second more efficient data source is Markit which reflects
credit risk more efficiently than JP Morgan, Fenics and Reuters EOD. The latter are all
equally efficient.

6.3. Using other econometric methodologies
As a robustness test we repeat the previous analysis using alternative econometric
techniques: pooled OLS regressions and Prais-Winsten regressions after filling the
missing observations. We compare the results against the ones in Table 4 and show the
robustness test results in Table 8.
To test whether the assumption of firm fixed effects affect significantly the results, we
pool all the data and run a pooled OLS regression. As can be seen in Column (2) of
Table 8 the effects of all the potential determinants of the CDS quotes’ divergence are

32

similar to those presented in Table 4 and repeated in Column (1) of Table 8 for
comparison, with the exception of the coefficient of the interaction term which now
turns positive.23 Therefore, the assumption of firm fixed effects does not have a major
effect on the results.
Our data form an unbalanced panel and so, we also run a Prais-Winsten regression with
correlated panels, corrected standard errors (PCSEs) and robust to heteroskedasticity,
contemporaneous correlation across panels and serial autocorrelation within panels. The
correlation within panels is treated as a first-order autocorrelation AR(1) and the
coefficient of this process common to all the panels.24,25 The results are reported in
Column (3) of Table 8. The only difference with respect to the baseline results (Column
(1) of Table 8) is that the interaction variable is not significant.
6.4. Testing the robustness of the results to data transformations
The dependent variable that we employ in the previous analysis is defined in logs in
order to limit the effect of potential outliers which could appear in the quoted spreads
due to any mistake in the contributed prices. By using the logs we also limit potential
problems derived from a skewed distribution given that the value of the mean is almost
four times the value of the median. We repeat regression (1) using as the dependent
variable the ratio between the logarithm of the standard deviation among the CDS

Note that the correlation between the dependent variable and the interaction term is very low (-0.005).
Each element in the covariance matrix of the disturbances is computed with all available observations
that are common to the two panels contributing to the covariance.
25
The panel is unbalanced because we do not have information on some variables from the beginning of
the sample. However, there are no missing values once we include the first realization of the series. There
were some missing observations in the VIX Index across the 90 firms due to the US holidays (i. e.: third
Monday in January and February, Last Monday in May, July 4, First Monday of September, Fourth
Thursday in November, etc.). However, we exclude these days from our analysis. There were some
missing values in the market capitalization variable which are related with holidays in the corresponding
country. Nevertheless, due to the low variability in this variable, we substitute the missing data with the
first previous day’s data available.

quotes and the logarithm of mean across the CDS quotes. The results are almost
identical to the ones reported in Table 4.
The data obtained from Reuters EOD are available from December 2007 whereas the
remaining data sources have information starting from January 2004. To avoid any
potential bias due to the different length of the sample period covered by the different
data sources we repeat the previous analysis without including the Reuters EOD quotes.
We do not report these results to save space but they are almost identical to the ones
reported in Table 4.
The data obtained from Fenics and Markit are available up to June 2009 and December
2009, respectively. To test if the results are biased by the lack of date in a given data
source after a given date, we estimate equation (1) using data first up to June 2009, and
after up to December 2009. The sign and magnitude of the coefficients are very similar
to the ones reported in the first column of Table 4 and are available upon request.
All the data sources but Fenics are based on the traders or dealers prices. As was
mentioned in Section 3, Fenics data can be actual trades or mid prices calculated from
the bid/offer quotes. If none of these are available, GFI, which is the responsible of the
Fenics quotes, calculates the CDS spread using the Hull and White methodology to
ensure a credit curve always exists for each reference entity. Thus, we repeat regression
(1) using as the dependent variable the logarithm of the standard deviation among the
CMA, Markit, Reuters EOD and JPMorgan quotes (excluding Fenics) on the
corresponding explanatory variables.26 Results are consistent with the ones obtained
when we include Fenics in our analysis.

26

We restrict our analysis to the European subsample in which we have information on JPM given that
the use of the whole sample imply that the standard deviations across quotes calculated in the period
before the crisis is obtained with just two contributors (CMA and Markit).

34

Since the beginning of the financial crisis counterparty risk in the CDS contracts has
been partially mitigated through the use of collateralization. Actually, full
collateralization of CDS liabilities has become the market standard. The ISDA Margin
Survey 2009 reports that 74 percent of CDS contracts executed during 2008 were
subject to collateral agreements. In order to limit any potential difference in the use of
this collateral by the CDS data source we repeat the same analysis using a sub sample
which spans up to December 2007 given that the use of the collateral was more limited
before 2008. The results do not materially differ from the ones reported in the first
column of Table 4. The only significant difference is that the coefficient of interaction
of the number of days without a trade one day ago and the trade dummy, although with
a positive sign is not significant now (p-value = 0.23).

One problem of using composite and consensus prices is that we do not know the
contributors who “contribute” to form these prices or how these prices are obtained. We
only observe the final price which is obtained by averaging different dealers quoted and
traded prices. However, for a sample of European firms we observe JPM quoted and
traded prices and Fenics constructed, quoted and traded (by means of GFI) prices
although in any of the two cases we cannot distinguish between traded and
quoted/constructed spreads. Both JPM and Fenics CDS spreads are obtained from single
sources and not by aggregating data. As an additional robustness analysis, we test if the
previous results are maintained when we compare prices obtained from two single (not
composite) sources: the most active inter-dealer broker (GFI/Fenics) and the most active
broker (JP Morgan). We focus our analysis on the results reported in Table 4 and
regress the difference between the 5-year JPM and Fenics CDS spreads both in absolute
and relative terms on the same explanatory variables that are employed in equation (1).

35

The difference between JPM and Fenics CDS spread in relative terms is obtained as the
absolute difference between both data sources divided by the mean between JPM and
Fenics spreads. Since there is a high correlation between the CDS bid-ask spread and
the VIX Index (0.714) for the cases in which we have observations on both JPM and
Fenics we include only one of these variable in the regression. Results are shown in
Table 9. Even when we compare data sources which are formed individually without
attending to a conglomerate of traders, the differences persist and can be explained by
the same variables as the baseline case in Table 4, independently of whether the
difference between the two quotes are reported in absolute (Columns (1) and (2)) or
relative terms (Columns (3) and (4)).

7. Conclusions
We study the consistency of the six most widely used CDS data bases: GFI, Fenics,
Reuters EOD, CMA, Markit and JP Morgan, for the period from 2004 to 2010 using the
most liquid single name 5-year CDS of the components of the leading market indexes,
iTraxx (European firms) and CDX (US firms). We find that there are significant
differences among them in several dimensions.

Our main empirical findings are:

1) When timely information on traded prices is available, the different price
sources largely agree among them in aggregate terms. However as the
information on transaction prices become scarcer, prices from different sources
tend to diverge from the common trend. The most extreme disagreements are in

36

the case of American reference entities during the crisis, where very few
transaction prices are available in the GFI database.

2) Deviations (in absolute value) from the common trend among the different CDS
quoted spreads are not purely random but related to idiosyncratic factors like
firm size and also to liquidity, global risk and trading factors. Prices tend to
diverge more from the common trend in the case of for smaller firms. Increases
in market illiquidity, idiosyncratic stock market volatility and global volatility
increase the divergence from the common trend among prices coming from
different data bases.

3) CMA quoted CDS spreads led the credit risk price discovery process with
respect to the quotes provided by the other databases.

Extensive robustness tests support these results. Since our analysis is based on the most
liquid CDS prices, we would expect that the differences we find for these prices in the
different databases would be even larger for less liquid CDSs not included in our study.

Our analysis has important implications for research studies and industry participants.
First, for US names with low trade frequency, no reliable information exists because
there are almost no recorded trade prices in the GFI platform. Second, in studies of price
discovery of the CDS market with respect other markets and given that there is a data
source (CMA) leading the others, empirical results may change depending on the
database employed. Third, the smaller the firm, the higher volatility of the deviations
from the common trend of the quoted prices provided by the different CDS data sources
and therefore the less reliable and comparable research results might be. Fourth, in
37

times of high illiquidity or increased stock market volatility CDS prices from different
databases will tend to substantially diverge from the common trend making it more
difficult for agents to disentangle the CDS fair value from the different prices they
receive from the databases and for researcher using the data to decide what database
gives the market prices’ most reliable account.
Looking forward, the analysis of how the discrepancy among the different CDS
contributors may affect the relation between the CDS and corporate Bond spreads is a
topic worth studying. Also the consequences of using different CDS sources on testing
the degree of informational efficiency of the different markets where credit risk is
traded is also an interesting avenue for future research.

Table 1: Firm Names by Sector and CDS Index (iTraxx and CDX)
This table shows the descriptive statistics for the single name 5-year CDS. Panel A shows the names classified by
index and sector. We use European and American firms included in the iTraxx and the CDX indexes, respectively,
over the whole sample period. Panels B, C, D, E, and F, provide the CDS descriptive statistics for the European
single name CDSs. The information is divided before and during the crisis. Each of the five previous panels
corresponds to different data sources. Panel B reports the CDS traded spreads information for GFI (Number of Trades
or Quotes, Trades per day, Mean, Std Dev., Median, Skewness, and Kurtosis of the CDS spreads as well as the
coefficient of the AR(1) based on the CDS spreads) while Panels C, D, E, and F reports the information for CMA,
Markit, Fenics, and Reuters EOD, respectively. Panels G, H, I, J, and K, provide the CDS descriptive statistics for the
American single name CDSs. The information is divided before and during the crisis. Panel G reports the information
obtained from GFI while Panels H, I, J, and K provide the information obtained from CMA, Markit, Fenics, and
Reuters EOD, respectively. As the actual sample size of the different data sources differ (because of missing values
and slightly different periods covered), we report the summary statistics for the cases in which we have common
observations (trades and quotes) in all the data sources in Panel L. Finally, Panels M and N report the unit root tests
for all the European and American single name CDSs. In the last two panels, I(1) is used to indicate that the series
have a unit root and are integrated of order one and I(0) to indicate that the series are stationary.

Table 2: The distribution of the quoted and traded CDS spreads
Summary statistics for the distribution of the quoted and traded 5y CDS spreads for the firms in
Table 1. Panel A provides the distribution of the number of quoted spreads on a given day for a
single name CDS. The first column reports the number of observations for which there are 1, 2, 3
and 4 quotes, respectively. The second column reports the percentage of cases in which there are
1, 2, 3, and 4 quotes, respectively, and is obtained as the ratio of second column and the total
number of days. The last column of Panel A reports the cumulative percentage across the range
of quotes. Panel B reports the distribution of the range of the mean absolute difference, in basis
points, among all the possible pairs of quoted spreads on a given day for a single 5-year CDS.
For instance, the first row in the first column reports the number of days in which the absolute
difference between the different pairs of databases is lower than 1 basis point, and so on. Panel C
provides the distribution of the range of the mean absolute difference, in basis points, between all
the possible pairs formed by the GFI traded CDS spread and one of the different quoted CDS
spreads. The sample period is January 2004 to March 2010.

Table 3: Time-serial correlation between variables
This table reports the correlation coefficients between the dependent and explanatory variables employed in equation (1). Log(Std. Dev. CDS spreads), the dependent variable in equation (1),
refers to the cross-sectional standard deviation among the CDS spreads reported by the different data sources in a given day. Log (Mkt. Cap.) refers to the logarithm of the firm market
capitalization. Trade is a dummy variable which is equal to one if there is a trade registered in GFI in the current date and to zero otherwise. Days w/o a trade represents the number of days
without a trade up to the current date. Interaction Trade and Days w/o trade is constructed as the interaction between the number of days without a transaction up to one day ago and a dummy
variable (Trade) which equals one if there is a trade the current date. CDS Bid-Ask Spread refers to the daily CDS bid-ask spread which is obtained from CMA. VIX Index represents the value
of the VIX Index. Max quotes refers to a dummy variable which equals one when all the data sources available at a given date report a quote and is equal to zero otherwise.

among the CDS data sources
This table reports the regression coefficients of the unbalanced panel regressions. The dependent
variable is the standard deviation among the different CDS data sources (CMA, Markit, Fenics,
Reuters EOD). The database includes ninety European and US firms (47 of the firms are
European and the rest are American) which are the most liquid CDSs included in either the
Itraxx or the CDX Index since the launching of the indexes, from January 2004 to April 2010.
The estimation uses a fixed-effects model robust to heteroskedasticity. Column (1) reports the
results for the whole sample of firms, Column (2) reports the results for the subsample of
European firms, and Column (3) reports the results for the subsample of American firms. The tstatistics are reported between brackets.

Table 5: Determinants of the standard deviation among the CDS data
sources using the number of contributors as an explanatory variable
This table reports the regression coefficients of the unbalanced panel regressions. The
dependent variable is the standard deviation among the different CDS data sources (CMA,
Markit, Fenics, Reuters EOD). The database includes ninety European and US firms (47 of
the firms are European and the rest are American) which are the most liquid CDSs included
in either the Itraxx or the CDX Index since the launching of the indexes, from January 2004
to April 2010. The estimation uses a fixed-effects model robust to heteroskedasticity.
Column (1) reports the baseline regression's results for the whole sample of firms without
using the number of contributors as an explanatory variable. Column (2) reports the results
obtained by adding the number of contributors as an additional explanatory variable to the
ones in Column (1). Column (3) reports the results obtained using as an additional
explanatory variable a generated regressor which is obtained after regressing the number of
contributors on the VIX Index and the CDS bid-ask spread and then using the residual to
proxy the number of contributors net of the global risk and the illiquidity effect in the CDS
market. In order to estimate the coefficients presented in Column (3) of this table we use the
bootsptrap methodology to correct any potential bias in the standard errors due to the use of
a generated regressor. The t-statistics are reported between brackets.

Table 6: Price Discovery Analysis by Pairs of CDS spreads
This table reports the results of the price discovery analysis. First, we estimate the GonzaloGranger (GG) price discovery metrics for different pairs of 5-year single name CDS spreads
using different data sources. The estimations are based on a VECM in which the VARlength is selected according to the Schwarz information criteria. Then we calculate the
average Gonzalo-Granger metric for all the firms, the European and the American firms for
the different pairs of data sources. When the price discovery metric is higher than 0.5, the
corresponding data source leads the price discovery process. The symbols ***, **, and *
(^^^, ^^, and ^) summarize the statistical significance test and indicate that the average price
discovery metric (GG) corresponding to a given data source is significantly higher (lower)
than 0.5 at a significance level of 99, 95 and 90%, respectively.

Table 8: Determinants of the standard deviation among the CDS data sources
using alternative regression methods
This table reports the regression coefficients of the unbalanced panel regressions. The dependent
variable is the standard deviation among the different CDS data sources (CMA, Markit, Fenics,
Reuters EOD). The database includes ninety European and US firms (47 of the firms are
European and the rest are American) which are the most liquid CDSs included in either the
Itraxx or the CDX Index since the launching of the indexes, from January 2004 to April 2010.
We estimate the coefficients of the determinants of the standard deviation among the CDS data
sources by means of different methodologies. Column (1) reports the results obtained using a
fixed-effects model robust to heteroskedasticity as in Column (1) of Table 4. The results
presented in Column (2) are obtained by means of a pooled-regression. Column (3) reports the
results obtained using a Prais-Winsten regression with correlated panels corrected standard
errors (PCSEs) and robust to heteroskedasticity, contemporaneous correlation across panels and
serial autocorrelation within panels. The correlation within panels is treated as a first-order
autocorrelation AR(1) and the coefficient of this process common to all the panels. Each
element in the covariance matrix of the disturbances is computed with all available observations
that are common to the two panels contributing to the covariance. The t-statistics are reported
between brackets.

Table 9: Determinants of the differences between JPM and Fenics CDS spreads
This table reports the regression coefficients of the unbalanced panel regressions. The database includes
ninety European and US firms (47 of the firms are European and the rest are American) which are the
most liquid CDSs included in either the Itraxx or the CDX Index since the launching of the indexes,
from January 2004 to April 2010. The estimation uses a fixed-effects model robust to heteroskedasticity.
Columns (1) and (2) report the coefficients of the determinants of the JPM and Fenics CDS spreads
difference in absolute terms when we exclude the CDS Bid-Ask Spread and the VIX Index variables,
respectively. Columns (3) and (4) provide the coefficients of the determinants of the JPM and Fenics
CDS difference in relative terms when we exclude the CDS Bid-Ask Spread and the VIX Index
variables, respectively. The difference in relative terms is obtained as the ratio between the difference in
absolute terms and the mean between JPM and Fenics spreads. The t-statistics are reported between

Figure 2. Data Sources’ Average Absolute Discrepancies (AAD). This figure shows the cross-sectional deviations
across data sources over time. The series is computed as the absolute value of the average difference across pairs of
data sources (CMA - Markit, CMA - Fenics, CMA - Reuters, Markit - Fenics, Markit - Reuters, Fenics – Reuters)
divided by the average CDS spread across the four previous data sources (CMA, Markit, Fenics, and Reuters) for each
firm. Then, we calculate the average of the previous series date by date across the total number of entities.
