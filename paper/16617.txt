ABSTRACT
Soon after beginning operations, the Federal Reserve established a nationwide network for collecting
information about the economy. In 1919, the Fed began tabulating data by about retail sales, which
it viewed as a fundamental measure of consumption. From 1920 until 1929, the Federal Reserve published
data about retail sales each month by Federal Reserve district, but ceased to do so after 1929. It continued
to compile monthly data on retail sales by reserve district, but this data remained in house. We collected
these in-house reports from the archives of the Board of Governors and constructed a consistent series
on retail trade at the district level. The new series enhances our understanding of economic trends
during the Roaring „20s and Great Depression.

Introduction
The United States‟ experiment with regional central banks from 1913 to 1935 provides an
opportunity to study monetary and fiscal policies in an environment similar to that which exists
in the European Union today. Federal Reserve districts possessed a common currency, a trade
union, and intertwined monetary policies. Fiscal policies were set by the governments of states,
whose constitutions typically required balanced budgets. Recent research shows that differences
among districts can help to identify relationships – such as impact of discount lending during
banking panics – that economists have trouble identifying with recent data (Richardson and
Troost 2009). The only constraint on such studies is the lack of data. Few data series exist at the
Federal-Reserve-district level. National income accounts for the United States begin in 1929. So
do many other statistical series of interest to economics.
This essay begins to fill that lacuna in the literature. It presents new data on retail trade
for the United States as a whole and for each Federal Reserve district. This task involves the
construction of several subsidiary data series: a series on retail trade each month in each Federal
Reserve district, a seasonally adjusted version of that monthly series, annual population estimates
for each district, and annual growth in per capita retail trade in each district.
Constructing these series involves tackling a number of statistical issues. The issues
include seasonally adjusting monthly series, merging series with different base years, merging
series reported in different metrics (such as index values and percentage changes), estimating
populations for Federal Reserve districts by summing estimates made at the county level,
converting monthly into annual series, and calculating per capita growth from changes in index
values and population levels.

Another statistical issue is the difference between the data as initially reported and the
data after subsequent revisions. The initial series represents the information available to agents at
the time they make decisions. Throughout our essay, we refer to this series as “initial data” or
“initial reports.” The final series indicates the actual state of the economy. Throughout our essay,
we refer to this series as the “final data,” “final reports,” or “final data series.” The former and
the latter often differ. Statistical agencies, such as the Federal Reserve, release data about the
economy, such as retail trade reports, on a regular schedule. Sometimes on the day of release,
they lack accurate or complete information. After the initial release, they update reports, correct
errors, incorporate additional information, and revise previous estimates. For data on retail trade,
the Federal Reserve routinely released updates. Some of these revisions were significant,
particularly from 1919 through 1923, when the series underwent large revisions, in part because
the Federal Reserve realized that its data reporting system provided erroneous information about
the state of the economy from 1919, when the lifting of wartime restrictions resulted in a
consumption boom, to 1921, when a recession beset all Federal Reserve districts.1
The rest of this essay accomplishes these tasks. Section 2 describes the data sources.
Section 3 describes the methods that we use to calculate our statistical series. Section 4 compares
retail trade across the Federal Reserve districts. Section 5 compares patterns in growth rates of
retail trade. Section 6 compares patterns in growth rates of per capita retail trade. Section 7
compares retail trade during the NBER business cycles. Section 8 studies growth rates of
population. Section 9 examines the seasonal consumption cycle. Section 10 examines
differences between the initial and final data series. Section 11 concludes.

2. Data Sources
Determining retail sales per capita requires data on retail trade and population. Data on
retail trade comes from two sources. The first is the Federal Reserve Bulletin, a monthly
publication of the Federal Reserve Board containing detailed information about the United States
economy, financial markets, and the behavior of the central bank. The second is “Department
Store Sales Preliminary Reports,” a monthly internal memorandum produced by the Federal
Reserve Board. This unpublished material resides in the research library of the Board of
Governors.2
In 1919, the Federal Reserve Board began to develop an index of retail trade. The project
involved obtaining information about monthly sales “from department stores of representative
character throughout the country (Federal Reserve Bulletin, January 1920, p. 53).” Department
stores were defined as large shops selling many different kinds of articles at different sales
counters and commonly known as department stores in their respective cities. The sample
included the nation‟s largest mail-order houses and five-and-ten-cent chains. The sample
excluded “specialized retail stores and large apparel stores, even if these establishments reported
regularly and voluntarily to the reserve system (Federal Reserve Bulletin, February 1928, p.
115).”
In February 1920, the Federal Reserve Bulletin published an initial index for the Twelfth
District based on reports from twenty-nine establishments. The number of stores increased over
time. Within a few months, the number of reporting establishments rose to over 300. In October
1920, the Federal Reserve Bulletin for the first time published information on retail sales in all
twelve Federal Reserve districts. The data described the month of August 1920. In December

Note that the Federal Reserve Bulletin and the Federal Reserve‟s Preliminary Reports use the terms “retail
trade,” “retail sales,” and “department store sales” as synonyms.

1924, 374 establishments reported monthly sales, including all of the nation‟s largest department
stores, mail-order houses, and five-and-ten-cent chains. In June 1925, the number rose to 523. In
February 1928, the number rose to 565. Reported sales exceeded $2,000,000,000, or
approximately 36 percent of total sales of all department stores in the nation. These reporting
establishments operated in 253 cities. In most of these cities, “stores reporting monthly to the
Federal Reserve banks (made) up at least two-thirds of the sales of all department stores (Federal
Reserve Bulletin, February 1929 p. 115).” Stores located in cities with a population exceeding
500,000 accounted for approximately 55 percent of the sales of all reporting stores. Stores
located in cities with populations between 100,000 and 500,000 accounted for 32 percent of total
sales. Information concerning city size and sales reports appears in Table 1.
Information on sales was “reported by the cooperating stores to the Federal reserve banks
in each of the 12 Federal reserve districts, which in turn (sent the information) to the Federal
Reserve Board, where a retail report covering the entire United States (was) compiled and
published (Federal Reserve Bulletin, July 1925, p. 474)”. Retail establishments submitted
information on sales on the sixth day of each month. After collating reports from every store in
its district, “the Federal reserve bank telegraph(ed) the total dollar sales for all stores to the
Federal Reserve Board, where the sales from all reserve districts (were compiled). The combined
report for the United States (was) telegraphed to each Federal reserve bank on the eighth of the
month and a national report (was) prepared and sent to the reporting stores and published on the
tenth of the month (Federal Reserve Bulletin, July 1925, pp. 474-475).”
The Federal Reserve guaranteed anonymity to the firms that reported. To protect
proprietary information, the Federal Reserve disseminated data on retail sales as an index
indicating the amount in a base period and percentage changes from that base. The Federal

4

Reserve periodically changed the base and the way in which it reported the data. In January
1920, the initial base was the average value of monthly sales for each Federal Reserve district in
1918, and the series reported percentage changes from that base, but not the index itself. In
March 1923, the Federal Reserve Bulletin began publishing the indices of retail sales, with a
base year of 1919, as well as the changes from the preceding month. In February 1928, a revision
set the base of 100 to be average retail sales in a district from 1923 to 1925. Tables presented the
entire series up to that point in time with the new and the old (1919) base. The revision also
adjusted the series for variations in the number of business days per month, due to phenomena
such as leap years, holidays, the changing date of Easter, and the rotation of week days through
the annual calendar. The Federal Reserve Bulletin for February 1928 reported revised data for
January 1919 through December 1927. According to the Bulletin, this series “supersede(d) the
old indexes that have been published up to the present time. These new indexes are based upon
data reported by a larger number of stores, more widely distributed, and have a broader and more
recent base period.”3 The Bulletin continued to report data in this format for two and a half
years.
The 1928 revision also added a substantial amount of historical information. This
information included new series for the St. Louis district back to 1921 and Kansas City district
back to 1924. The series for Chicago was also completely revised going back to 1921. Chicago
revision appears to have been facilitated by the receipt of copious amounts of historical
information from retail stores throughout the Seventh District. This information allowed the size
of the sample to be expanded and its coverage to be more representative.4

Unfortunately, in August 1930, the Bulletin stopped publishing data on retail sales by
district. From then on, the Bulletin only published the index for the entire United States.
Thereafter, district-level retail-sales data appears only in the Federal Reserve Board‟s
preliminary reports on retail sales. This internal memorandum reported percentage changes in
retail sales in each district in each month compared with the same period of the previous year.
Copies of this internal memo survive in the research library of the Federal Reserve Board of
Governors for the months December 1924 through January 1940.
Data on population comes from two sources. The first is the United States Census of
Population for the years 1920, 1930, and 1940. In 1920, the Census determined where
individuals resided on January 1 of that year. In 1930 and 1940, the Census determined where
individuals resided on April 1. For all three decades, the Census tabulated the number of
individuals residing in each county. Computerized county-level tabulations come from the
ICPSR.5 The second source is “Population Estimates, 1900 to 1950, ” which estimates the
population of each state on July 1 of each year from data on migration, births, and deaths.6

3. Methods for Constructing Statistical Series
Converting the raw evidence of retail trade into useful statistical series involves several
steps. The first is determining the level of retail trade in each month relative to a base period. The
second is adjusting the monthly series for seasonal variations. The third is calculating the rate of
growth for retail trade at an annual frequency. The fourth is calculating the rate of growth of the
population. The fifth is calculating the rate of growth of retail sales per capita, by adjusting sales
growth to account for population growth.

Retail Trade: Initial and Final Data

The Federal Reserve routinely released updates of information on retail sales. The
structure of the table in the Federal Reserve Bulletin facilitated these updates. The table included
information from the latest month available, the previous month, and the same month in the
preceding year. For example, the Federal Reserve Bulletin‟s issue for October 1930 contains
retail sales figures for August and July 1930 and August 1929. On several occasions, the Federal
Reserve recapitulated all previously published data. These recapitulations brought all of the
previously published data up to the current standard.
Our essay reports both the final and initial data series. The final data series is constructed
by examining the Federal Reserve Bulletin for 1930 and working backwards through the issues
in reverse chronological order. This process yields the final series for the entire United States for
the years 1919 to 1939 and for the twelve Federal Reserve districts for the period from 1919 until
August 1930. Data for the Federal Reserve districts for the years 1929, 1928, and 1927 comes
from latest issues in which the information appears (i.e. the first issue in which it is found in
reverse chronological order). Data for years prior to 1927 comes from the February 1928 issue,
which contained a table of revisions stretching from 1926 back to the beginning of the series.
For years 1930 to 1939, district-level data comes from the Federal Reserve‟s unpublished
Preliminary Report. The reports are processed using the procedures employed on the Federal
Reserve Bulletin. We begin with the latest memorandum and work backwards through the series,
finding final revisions of monthly data and incorporating them into our series. The information in
the Preliminary Report differs from that in the Bulletin in an important respect. The Preliminary
Report indicates the percentage change of retail sales from the same month in the preceding year.
Fortuitously, the Preliminary Reports and the Bulletin overlap for a period sufficient to extend
the retail trade indices until 1939. The results of our endeavor appear in Table 2.

7

Reversing our procedure for constructing the final index yields information about initial
reports. We begin with the earliest issue of the Bulletin, work through the issues in
chronological order, and record the first report of retail trade for each month. The initial data
appears in several formats, such as changes from the previous month, index values with the base
set as the average value in 1919, and index values with the base set as the average value from
1923 to 1925. We standardize this information, and report all initial figures as index values with
the base set as the average value from 1923 to 1925, so that the initial reports can be compared to
the final data series, which are reported in the same metric. The results of this endeavor appear in
Table 3.
Lacunae appear in some of the series for initial reports. These blank spots indicate that
the Federal Reserve bulletin did not initially report information for some districts when it
presented information for the rest. For example, at various times and for various reasons, the
Federal Reserve failed to report initial figures for Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and St.
Louis.
3.2 Seasonal Adjustment
Seasonal movements exist in many statistical series, including retail sales. Heating-oil
sales surge during the winter. Cooling-fan sales surge during the summer. Consumption peaks
every year during December. The obvious explanation is Christmas. These seasonal movements
obscure economic trends, cyclical fluctuations, and turning points in time series. So, economists
typically remove these seasonal variations. During the 1920s, the Federal Reserve published
seasonally adjusted retail trade series as well as seasonally unadjusted data. In 1928, the Federal
Reserve described its methods for adjusting for cyclical fluctuations, but on many occasions, the

8

Federal Reserve‟s methods were opaque.7 Therefore, we adjust the raw data for seasonal
fluctuations using modern techniques. The cutting-edge techniques come from the Census
Bureau. The Bureau‟s X-12 ARIMA algorithm estimates seasonal, trend, and irregular
components of time series using regression models with ARIMA errors, symmetric moving
averages, a moving seasonality ratio, and after accounting for outlier and calendar effects. We do
this using the X-12 ARIMA function in the EVIEWS statistical package. We report the final data
series adjusted for seasonal fluctuations in Table 4 and seasonal component in Table 5.
3.3 Annual Growth Rates
Economists have many options when converting monthly data to annual growth rates.
Potential methods include
a. Calculating the annual average for the monthly series and then the growth of this average
from one year to the next.
b. Calculating the annual median for the monthly series and then this median‟s growth from
one year to the next.
c. Calculating the growth rate for each month from the same month in the previous year,
and then averaging these growth rates.
d. Picking one month out of the year – perhaps the first month (January), a middle month
(July), the peak month (December), or the last month (also December) – then calculating
the growth rate between that month and the same month in the previous year.
We calculate the annual growth rate using all of these methods, and then compared the results.
Figure 1 displays the outcome of this exercise. The dashed line indicates the growth of
retail sales in the month indicated from the same month in the previous year. The other symbols
indicate the annual growth rate calculated by the method indicated in the key. The square, for
7

Federal Reserve Bulletin, March 1928, p. 240.

9

example, indicates the annual growth rate approximated by the growth from December in one
year to December in the next. The lightest horizontal line indicates the annual median of the
month to month growth rates. The darkest horizontal line indicates the annual average of the
month to month growth rates. In almost all cases, the latter line lies at a point almost identical to
the line indicating the growth rate of the annual average of the monthly indices. These lines also
closely approximate the growth in retail trade between July in one year and July in the previous
year. Since we measure population during July and calculate population growth rates between
this July and the previous July, we choose to use the annual average of the month to month
growth rates as our measure of the annual growth of retail sales. The results of this exercise
appear in Table 6.
Scholars who use our data for macroeconomic studies may make different decisions
about how to calculate the growth rate. Scholars should ensure that their measure of the retailsales growth rate should be consistent with other decisions that they make concerning
aggregating, averaging, and differentiating data series.
3.4

Population and Population Growth
Calculating the population of Federal Reserve districts requires extrapolating from census

data sets. The Census Bureau enumerated the population of the United States in the years 1910,
1920, 1930, and 1940, but in those years, enumerations occurred on different dates. Between
those years, the Census did not enumerate populations. The Census did, however, estimate the
population of all states on July 1st of each year. The population on July 1st is useful information,
because it enables us to accurately estimate the annual growth rate of the population and of retail
sales per capita. So, we base our series of population in Federal Reserve districts on the Census
Bureau‟s estimates of state populations on July 1st.

10

The geography of Federal Reserve districts complicates these calculations. Federal
Reserve districts frequently contained fractions of states. The 6th (Atlanta) District, for example,
contained all of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and portions of Tennessee, Mississippi, and
Louisiana. The 2nd (New York) District contained all of New York and portions of Connecticut
and New Jersey.
To calculate the population of a Federal Reserve district, we sum the population of the
states and the portions of states that the district contains. We calculate the fraction of a state‟s
population lying within a Federal Reserve district by summing the populations of the counties
within the district and dividing by the total population of the state.8 This procedure works
because Federal Reserve districts contain groups of contiguous counties, and because counties
were never split between Federal Reserve districts. Data on the population of counties exists only
during the census years of 1910, 1920, 1930, and 1940. Between these years, we assume that the
fraction of the state‟s population with a Federal Reserve district changes linearly. Given these
assumptions, the population of the ith Federal Reserve district‟s population in year t is fit

The annual reports of the Federal Reserve Board listed the name of counties in each district. Note that during the
1920s, counties in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota,
Montana, and Texas split and formed new counties. During the 1930s, two counties in Georgia merged to form
Fulton County.

lies entirely within one Federal Reserve district, then pijt equals 1. Table 7 reports the population

population in each Federal Reserve district.
3.5

Growth in Per Capita Retail Trade
The Federal Reserve protected manufacturers‟ proprietary information by reporting retail

sales as an index, rather than in dollar terms. Lack of information about the volume of sales
prevents us from calculating the volume of retail trade per person. The growth rate of retail trade
per person, however, can be calculated. The growth rate of per capita trade per year, gt, is given
by the following formula

where the volume of retail trade (in dollar terms), rt, is unknown. The volume of retail trade in
the base year (in dollar terms), b, is also unknown. But, the index of retail trade, it, which equals
rt / bt, and the population, ft, are known. Knowledge of it, ft, and the relationship between those
variables and gt, enables us to calculate the growth rate of per capita retail trade. Table 8 reports
the growth rate of per capita retail trade.

Section 4: Patterns in Levels of Retail Trade
Retail trade indices display striking patterns between 1919 and 1939, which Figure 2
illustrates. The figure plots the indices for all twelve Federal Reserve districts grouped into five
regions. The North East contains the Boston (1), New York (2), and Philadelphia (3) districts.
The Great Lakes contains the Cleveland (4) and Chicago (7) districts. The Great Plains contains
the St. Louis (8), Minneapolis (9), Kansas City (10), and Dallas (11) districts. The Pacific
contains the San Francisco (12) district.
Figure 2 reveals several patterns common across the series. In 1919, consumption appears
suppressed. A plausible explanation is the First World War. The armistice halted combat in
November 1918. The Treaty of Versailles officially ended the war in June 1919. Wartime
rationing ceased earlier that year. It took many months to shift resources from wartime

13

employment back to civilian uses, for soldiers to return home, and for peacetime patterns of
consumption to reemerge. In 1921, consumption fell across the board, in all months in all
regions, as the economy suffered from a severe but short recession. From 1922 to 1928,
consumption increased steadily. The peak for most districts occurred during the 1920s. The peak
for the United States as a whole occurred in 1928. From 1929 to 1932, consumption declined
rapidly. In 1933, the decline ended. In 1934, the recovery began. Recovery continued throughout
the 1930s, with a brief and mild hiatus during the double-dip recession in 1937 and 1938. At the
end of the decade, however, consumption in most districts had not returned to the peak
experienced during the Roaring 20s. The exception was the South, where consumption in 1939
exceeded levels that it had reached in the past.
A series of tables and figures illuminates these patterns in detail. Table 9‟s top half
provides summary statistics for retail trade in the twelve Federal Reserve districts and the United
States as a whole. The table indicates the maximum value of the index and the year in which the
maximum occurred. All maxima occurred in the month of December. The maximum for most
districts occurred during the 1920s. The maximum for Richmond, Atlanta, and Dallas, however,
occurred during 1939. The table also indicates the minimum value. The minimum occurred
either during the summer (July) or the winter (January, February, and March). The minimum for
all districts occurred during 1932 or 1933.
Table 10‟s bottom half provides the same statistics for the seasonally adjusted indices.
Now, the month of the maxima vary. The United States as a whole reached the maximum twice,
in August of 1927 and 1929. The maximum for Atlanta remains in the year 1939. The maxima
for Richmond and Dallas, however, shift to March 1937 and August 1926. The minima of the
seasonally adjusted series clearly cluster at the trough of the contraction. For Boston and New

14

York, the minimum occurred in January 1933. For all other districts, the minimum occurred in
March 1933.
Table 11‟s top half indicates the correlation coefficients between the series for each
Federal Reserve districts and for the United States as a whole. Boxes enclose correlation
coefficients less than 0.70. All of the series are highly correlated. The correlation between the
United States and four of the series – Boston, New York, Chicago, and Kansas City – equals
0.97. Kansas City appears to be the district which is most correlated with other districts, with
New York and Boston as close seconds. Minneapolis appears to be the least correlated with other
districts. Its correlation with the United States is the only one approaching 0.8. Minneapolis is
also the only series with correlation coefficient relative to another district of less than 0.7.
The overall patterns of correlation appear to be what one would expect given the
economic realities of the United States circa 1929. The financial centers of New York and
Chicago are highly correlated. So are the grain-growing regions of Minneapolis, Kansas City,
and St. Louis; and the southern regions of Dallas, Atlanta, and Richmond; and the Great Lakes
industrial regions of Cleveland and Chicago.
Table 11‟s bottom half displays the correlation between seasonally adjusted indices.
Extracting the seasonal cycle reduces the correlation across the series, obviously, because the
series shared a common seasonal component. All of the series, for example, experienced a boom
during December (Christmas) and a bust afterwards. Minneapolis remains the least correlated
district. Its coefficient of correlation with the United States is just 0.65. The southern region (5,
6, 11) also has a relatively low correlation with the United States. The average coefficient is just
0.76. This coefficient is small, considering that the coefficients of correlation between the
United States and other districts are over 0.9.

15

The patterns in Tables 10 and 11 inspired the groupings that we use when displaying our
data. We grouped into regions districts that were (a) highly correlated in Table 11, (b) shared
years of maxima and minima in Table 10, and (c) had a common concentration in a particular
economic sector, such as agriculture or industry.
Figure 3 illustrates an important pattern. Figure 3(a) plots the indices of four regions
divided by the index of the southern region. The dots in the figure indicate this ratio for each
month for each district. The lines in the figure indicate a twelve-month moving average of these
monthly observations. Figure 3(b) plots the same ratio with seasonally-adjusted data. No matter
how you look at the data, the pattern is clear. Consumption in the south rose relative to all other
regions. The rise began in 1925 relative to the Great Plains; in 1929 relative to the Great Lakes,
and in 1933 relative to the North East. By the end of the 1930s, consumption in the South had
risen over 20 percent relative to the national average.

Section 5: Patterns in Growth Rates of Retail Trade
Table 12 summarizes growth rates of retail trade at the district level. Rows (1) to (6)
present average growth rates for years indicated. Splitting the 1930s into two periods illuminates
the severity of the contraction and rapidity of the recovery. Rows (7) to (9) present standard
deviations for the periods 1919 to 1939, the 1920s, and the 1930s. Rows (10) to (11) indicate the
maximum and minimum growth rates of retail trade for the districts and the U.S. as a whole and
the years of occurrences.
Retail trade for the U.S. grew at an average annual rate of 1.43 percent from 1919 to
1939. In the 1920s, the annual growth rate averaged 1.19 percent. Average growth rates were
positive in all districts except for Minneapolis and Kansas City. In the 1930s, the annual growth

16

rate averaged -0.69 percent. Average growth rates were negative except for Cleveland,
Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas.
Growth rates varied during the 1930s. The decade began with a tremendous contraction.
From 1930 to 1933, retail trade declined on average 12.5 percent. Cleveland, Chicago, and San
Francisco performed much worse than the rest of the nation. In all three districts, retail sales
declined more than 13 percent per year. From 1933 to 1939, consumption in the United States
expanded by 5.21 percent per year. Consumption grew most rapidly in Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago
and Cleveland.
Rows (7) to (9) indicate standard deviations. The standard deviations reveal the volatility
of growth varied across districts. From 1919 to 1939, the standard deviation of the United States
was 9.80. Retail trade fluctuated by more than national average in Cleveland, Chicago, Atlanta,
St. Louis, and Dallas. During the 1930s, volatility increased in all districts. The standard
deviation for the United States as a whole rose from 5.38 to 11.48.
Rows (11) to (13) indicate the maxima and minima. For most districts, the highest
growth rate occurred in 1934 or 1936 during the recovery from the great contraction. The
maximum for Philadelphia and San Francisco, however, occurred in 1923 during the recovery
from the contraction of 1921. The minimum occurred in all districts in 1932. The max and min
were larger in the South districts and the Great Lakes districts. The largest value appeared in
Atlanta whose retail trade grew by 26.8 percent in 1934. The lowest value appeared in
Cleveland whose retail contracted by 26.7 percent in 1932.

Section 6: Patterns in Growth Rates of Per Capita Retail Trade

17

Table 13 summarizes growth rates of per capita retail trade. In the 1920s, per capita retail
trade increased at an annual average rate of 0.7 percent. Per capita retail trade expanded in
Boston, New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco. In the 1930s,
per capita retail trade declined by an annual average rate of 1.48 percent. Per capita retail trade
declined in all districts except for Atlanta and Dallas.
Per capita retail trade typically moved in the same direction as aggregate retail trade, but
not in all cases. In the 1920s, in San Francisco, for example, retail trade increased, but per capita
retail trade decreased. In St. Louis, retail trade declined, but per capita retail trade increased.
Aggregate and per capita trade moved in opposite directions, of course, due to population
movements that increased (or decreased) aggregate sales while per capita sales fell (or rose).
The statistical characteristics of per capita retail trade resembled the characteristics of
aggregate retail trade in many ways. Growth rates in Cleveland and Chicago fluctuated more
than those in Atlanta, Richmond, and Dallas. The maximum for most districts occurred in 1934.
The minimum for most districts occurred in 1932. Cleveland was the only exception.
Table 14 illuminates differences between growth in aggregate retail trade and growth in
per capita retail trade by region. From 1919 to 1939, retail trade increased in all regions, but per
capita retail trade increased only in the Great Lakes and the South. In the 1920s, the level of
retail sales decreased in the Great Plains and the South, but per capita sales decreased in all
districts. In the 1930s, retail trade increased in the Great Lakes and the South, but per capita trade
increased only in the South. All regions reached the highest growth during the recovery from the
Great Depression and the lowest growth during the contraction in the early 1930s.

Section 7: Retail Trade and NBER Business Cycles

18

The National Bureau of Economic Research determined that five business cycles
occurred in the United States between 1919 and 1939. The cycles are summarized in Table 15.
Columns (1) and (2) indicate peaks and troughs in each of the cycles. Column (3) indicates the
length of the contraction. Column (4) indicates the length of the expansion. Column (5) indicates
the time between the troughs. Column (6) indicates the time between the peaks. Up until 1929,
recessions lasted on average a little over one year except. The Great Depression, obviously,
lasted longer.
Figure 4 plots NBER cycles on top of retail trade for each Federal Reserve district. The
start of each shaded area indicates a business cycle peak. The end of each shaded area indicates
a business cycle trough. The figures show that fluctuations in business cycles coincided closely
with fluctuations in retail trade. Generally, retail trade fell from peak to trough and grew from
trough to peak.
Table 16 and Table 17 illuminate these patterns. Table 16 indicates statistical
characteristics for monthly growth rates for each recession. Row (1) provides averages for
monthly growth rates in the Federal Reserve districts and the United States as a whole. Rows (2)
to (5) provide the maximum and minimum growth rates and the year in which they occurred.
Table 17 provides the same information for retail trade indices.
During the business cycle in 1920-1921, the United States as a whole reached the
maximum in May, July, and August 1920 and the minimum in September of 1921. Most districts
reached the maximum in May or Ju1y 1920, except for Chicago and St. Louis, which peaked in
January 1920. Most districts reached their minima after the national trough. Near the national
trough, plummeting agricultural prices and strikes of steelmakers, coal mines, and railroad

19

weakened the economic activity.9 The Federal Reserve‟s decision to increase the discount rate
from 4.75 to 6 percent in January and to 7 percent in June 1920 exacerbated the situation. By the
middle of 1920, economic activity and employment were rapidly falling, and prices had begun
one of the sharpest declines in American history. The Federal Reserve System, however, did not
lower the discount rate until May 5, 1921.10
During the business cycle of 1923-1924, retail trade appears to have lagged the NBER
business cycle, although experiences varied across districts. Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis,
Dallas, and San Francisco peaked in late 1923. New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond
peaked in early 1924. Nine districts bottomed out in March 1924. This variation seems consisted
with the reported trigger of this cycle, which was new oil strikes in California, Texas, and
Oklahoma, which lowered incomes and reduced investment in older oil-producing regions, such
as Pennsylvania.
During the business cycle of 1926-1927, fluctuations in retail trade did not coincide with
NBER business cycle dates. Federal Reserve districts appear to have had varied experiences.
Some lead the national cycle. Others followed the national cycle. Some saw steep declines in
retail trade. Others experienced little hardship. This pattern seems consistent with the reported
trigger to the cycle, which was Henry Ford‟s decision to close his factories for 6 months, cease
production of the Model T, and retool for production of the new Model A. Sales of the Model T
amounted to 40 percent of all automobiles sold in the United States. Ford and its suppliers
employed a sizeable share of the high-wage industrial labor force. Idling these workers for six
months (without pay) noticeably reduced aggregate demand.

During the contraction from 1929 to 1933, retail trade declined at an average annual rate
of 11 percent. Consumption contracted severely in all districts. Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St.
Louis, and Dallas performed worse than the national average. Richmond performed the best; retail
sales in the Richmond district declined at an annual rate of only 7.6 percent. At the national level,

the contraction in retail trade began in August 1929, and lasted until March 1933. Most districts
coincided closely with this national pattern.

Section 8: Growth in Population
Aggregate retail sales may provide a misleading measure of the health of the economy if
changes in aggregate sales are due to changes in the population, rather than changes in
consumption per capita. Determining changes in per capita consumption requires data on
population (and population growth) at the Federal Reserve district level. That data does not
exist. So, we estimate the population in each district in each year. Table 18 presents our
estimates.
From 1919 to 1939, population in the U.S. grew by an annual average rate of 1.12
percent. The district with the quickest population growth was San Francisco, where population
grew twice as quickly as the national average, principally due to the arrival of migrants from
other states. The rapid growth of San Francisco‟s population is one reason for that district‟s rapid
retail-sales growth.
The pattern of population growth differed during the decades that we examine. During
the 1920s, the national population grew 1.54 percent per year. Population growth exceeded the
average in the New York, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco. This pattern reflects the ongoing
urbanization of America, as population shifted to growing urban areas; the beginnings of the
Great Migration, as African Americans began to leave the segregated South and seek
21

opportunities in Northern cities; and the expansion of new industries, such as coal mining in
West Virginia and Pennsylvania.
During the 1930s, the national population grew 0.69 percent per year. The low rate
reflects the decline in marriage and procreation due to the depression as well as the decline in
immigration due to legal barriers raised during the mid-20s. Rates were particularly low in areas
afflicted by the Dust Bowl, such as Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, and New Mexico,
where droughts destroyed crops, forcing farmers to flee to places where they could earn a living.
Table 19 compares growth in regional populations and shares of total population. From
1919 to 1939, regional shares of total population shifted considerably. Population grew rapidly in
the Pacific and South. Population grew slowly in the Great Plains. Population gradually shifted
towards the Sun Belt and the West Coast. The population share of other regions declined. The
Great Lakes‟ share of the population fell 0.02 percent per year. The Northeast‟s share declined
0.11 percent per year. The Great Plains‟ share declined most, by 0.58 percent per year. These
changes are illustrated in Figure 5.

Section 9: The Seasonal Cycle
Economic activity varies dramatically over the twelve months of the year, particularly for
retail sales. Christmas – as well as planting, the harvest, winter snow, and summer heat – are
obvious explanations. The retail-trade indices that we have constructed exhibit strong seasonal
patterns. These rhythms need to be removed for the data to be used in many applications. The
patterns themselves may be of interest. Barsky and Miron‟s (1989) essay illuminates the
relationship between seasonal and business cycles in post-war data. Bealieu, Mackie-Mason, and
Miron‟s (1992) essays demonstrates that countries which experience substantial seasonal cycles

22

also experience substantial business cycles. To facilitate analysis of such issues, this section
describes seasonal cycles in retail sales.
Figure 6 displays the seasonal component extracted by the algorithm described in Section
3. The pattern is obvious. Retail trade is lowest during the winter months of January and
February. Trade rises during the spring, falls during the summer, rises again during the fall, and
peaks during December. The figure plots the data for all twelve Federal Reserve districts
grouped into five regions. The North East contains the Boston (1), New York (2), and
Philadelphia (3) districts. The Great Lakes contains the Cleveland (4) and Chicago (7) districts.
The Great Plains contains the St. Louis (8), Minneapolis (9), Kansas City (10), and Dallas (11)
districts. The Pacific contains the San Francisco (12) district. The lines for the regions appear
nearly indistinguishable. The seasonal cycles across these regions appears to have a substantial
common component.
Figure 7 plots a measure of the common component. It is the seasonal variation for each
month averaged over all years and all districts. Sales fall below average in January, February,
July, and August. Sales rise increasingly above average during the fall and peak in December.
The Christmas-season surge produces almost all of the above average retail activity. Depending
on the year, the surge amounted to 5 percent to 10 percent of annual retail sales.
Figure 8 plots seasonal averages for each region. The common pattern is clearly evident,
but idiosyncrasies for certain regions can be discerned. In the South, sales appear to have been
higher during Christmas and lower during the winter. In the Great Plains and Great Lakes, the
seasonal surges and shortages seem smaller.
Table 20 examines the statistical characteristics of the seasonal cycle in all of the Federal
Reserve districts. The first row indicates the standard deviation of the seasonal component for

23

the entire sample period. It shows that New York and Richmond experienced the largest seasonal
cycles. Minneapolis experienced the mildest seasonal cycle. The experience of the other districts
resembled the national average. The second and third rows indicate the standard deviation during
the 1920s and 1930s respectively. At the national level, the standard deviation changed little, but
in five districts – Philadelphia, Cleveland, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City – the
seasonal cycle moderated, while in the Richmond district, the seasonal cycle accentuated. The
fourth and fifth rows indicate the maximum and minimum seasonal values. The maximum for
each district occurred in the month of December. In New York, Richmond, and Atlanta, the
December maximum amounted to 90 percent or more of average monthly spending.
The sixth through tenth rows examine the Christmas-season spending surge. The sixth
row (Average Xmas) indicates how much December spending exceeded average spending during
the months of March through June. December spending exceeded average by the greatest extent
in New York and Richmond. Those districts appear to have had consistently merry Christmases.
The seventh row (Maximum Xmas) indicates the maximum amount by which December
spending exceeded the average of March through June. The highest values appear for New York
and Richmond. High values also appear in San Francisco, Atlanta, and Dallas. The eight row
(Maximum Xmas Year) indicates the year of the maximum. For most districts, the maximum
occurred during Roaring 20s, but for the districts that recovered most rapidly during the Great
Depression, the maximum occurred during 1939. The ninth row (Minimum Xmas) and tenth row
(Minimum Xmas Year) indicate the magnitude and year of the minimum. The minimum
occurred in 1932 in all districts. In Boston, the minimum reoccurred in 1933. On average, the
minimum amounted to just over two-thirds of the average Christmas and one-half of the
maximum.

24

Section 10: Difference between the Initial and Final Series
Table 21 illuminates difference between the initial and final series. The table‟s first four
rows indicate the average difference for each Federal Reserve district for the full sample period,
for the years 1919 to 1922, the years 1923 to 1927, and the years 1928 to 1929. These periods
reflect changes in reporting methods. The remaining rows indicate the standard deviation of the
difference for the same periods. The difference is calculated by subtracting the monthly value of
the initial series from the final series. A negative value indicates that the initial series
overestimated the volume of retail trade, and the initial estimate was lowered to create the final
series. A positive value indicates that the initial series underestimated the volume of retail trade,
and the initial estimates had to be increased to create the final series.
The table reveals patterns of measurement errors in the initial indices. The average error
for the entire United States was -1.15. The negative value indicates that the initial indices
consistently overestimated retail trade. The magnitude and direction of the errors differed from
district to district. The Boston, Richmond, and Chicago districts typically overestimated retail
trade. The overestimation was especially large for Richmond and Chicago, as reflected in errors
of -1.69 and -2.56. Under-estimation occurred in Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Dallas, whose
errors averaged 3.20, 1.67, and 1.16 respectfully.
The direction of the errors changed over time. In six of the nine districts for which data
spans the enter sample period, the direction of the bias changes over time. Chicago for example,
overestimated retail trade during the first and third periods and underestimated retail trade during
the second period.

25

The magnitude of the errors also changed over time. For the United States as a whole, the
mean error decreased from 2.01 in the first period to 0.57 in the second period, and rose slightly
to 0.73 in the third period. Among the nine districts with index values available for the full
sample period, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas exhibited large measurement errors
in the first period, but the magnitude of these errors decreased substantially in subsequent
periods. The shrinking errors reflected improving quality of information, especially after 1922.
Table 21‟s bottom four rows report the standard deviation of measurement errors
imbedded in the initial index. For the United States as a whole for the entire sample period, the
standard deviation was 5.64. The standard deviation fell over time. In the first period, the
standard deviation was 7.58. In the latter periods, it was 3.86 and 4.34. This pattern held in
almost all Federal Reserve districts. The pattern indicates that over time, the initial estimates
improved, in the sense that the initial estimates increasingly resembled the final series.
Figure 9 illustrates this improvement. The figure plots the difference between the initial
and final series for each of the twelve districts in each month from January 1919 through August
1929. While discerning the pattern for an individual district is difficult, the overall pattern
appears clear. Errors shrink over time. Beginning in 1924, the measurement error i was small,
usually only a few percent and rarely exceeding 10 percent. By 1928, the measurement error had
fallen near zero.
Figure 10 provides insight into what did (and what did not) influence the quality of the
initial estimate. The figure plots the final index for the entire United States and the measurement
error for each month from 1919 to 1929. The errors appear uncorrelated with the index. The
correlation coefficient between the measurement error and the final index, 0.04, corroborates this
conclusion. The correlation coefficients between the error and the growth of the index from the

26

preceding month, 0.039, and between the error and growth of the index from the same month in
the preceding year, 0.22, also indicate little (or no) relationship between measurements errors
and cyclical movements in retail trade. These facts suggest big changes in the retail trade index
did not result in big errors in measurement. The improvement in the quality of the initial
estimates, in other words, stemmed primarily from improvements in data collection and
processing, not from changes in the seasonality or cyclicality of the economy.
Table 22 indicates measurement errors by month of the year. Columns (1) through (3)
indicate the average difference (i) for each month for the full sample period, (ii) for the years
1919 to 1922, and (iii) for the years 1923 to 1929. Columns (4) through (6) indicate the standard
deviation for the same periods. On average, the initial indices were overestimated in January,
March, April, May, August, October, and December. The initial indices were underestimated in
February, September, and November. After 1923, the standard deviation of errors declined. The
largest declines were for January, which fell from 10.41 to 0.062, and for March, which fell from
15.00 to 4.43.
To understand revisions, we examine the Seventh (Chicago) Federal Reserve District.
Chicago‟s retail trade index was revised in April 1923, December 1923, February 1926, February
1928, and February 1929. The February 1929 revision accompanied a special report that
explained the process. The Chicago Fed revised the series to improve the accuracy of the data
and increase the number of reporting stores. The Chicago Fed gathered data from department
stores being added to the index for all years back to 1919, and recalculated the index for previous
years to make it comparable to the new index.
The three revisions corrected errors in the initial indices, although the magnitude of
corrections differed from revision to revision. For example, the initial revision determined the

27

errors between April and November 1926 were small. The 1928 revision indicated those errors
were large (and gargantuan in September 1926). The 1929 revision detected errors lying between
the initial and 1928 revisions. The direction of correction also differed from revision to revision.
For example, for December 1924 and January 1925, the 1928 revision reported the initial values
to be overestimated, but 1929 revision found them to be correct.
This case study illustrates the Federal Reserve‟s struggle to accurately asses the state of
the economy during the early 1920s, as the Fed constructed a reporting system and learned to
process data. The Fed knew about the problems with its series. Uncertainty about economic
activity may have been one reason the Fed was reluctant to act during the 1930s.

Section 11: Conclusion
Retail trade is an important indicator of the state of the economy. The Federal Reserve
realized this fact and began collecting data on retail sales in 1919. The Federal Reserve published
some, but not all, of this information. This essay completes that task, by reconstructing the
Federal Reserve‟s statistical series on retail sales for each Federal Reserve district from 1919 to
1939. The reconstructed data illuminate important economic trends.
Retail trade followed business cycles closely. Retails sales increased during expansions
and decreased during contractions. Retail sales did not consistently lead or lag the cycle, but it
clearly commoved with industrial production, which the NBER used to date peaks and troughs in
business activity. Retail sales peaked in August of 1929, a month prior to the crash, and declined
precipitously during the next two years. Retail trade troughed in March of 1933. Retail sales
recovered rapidly during the New Deal, only to decline during the contraction of 1937, and
rebound the next year when economic expansion resumed.

28

Retail trade also exhibited a seasonal cycle, similar to that of our contemporary economy.
Trade peaked in December and troughed in the winter and summer. Christmas caused the surge
in December. Christmas spending plummeted during the contraction in the early 1930s and failed
to recover during the next decade. Christmas during the 1930s involved, as Gary‟s grandmother
frequently asserted, much less gift giving than Christmas did before or after.
Economic experiences varied across districts during the Roaring 20s and Great
Depression. During the 1920s, retail sales increased in New England, the Great Lakes, and the
Pacific Coast. During the 1930s, retail trade increased in the South and the Pacific. At that time,
however, consumption declined in the Great Plains, extending a trend that began in the middle of
the 1920s, when droughts began and the Dust Bowl formed.
The Federal Reserve‟s initial estimates of retail trade contained substantial measurement
error. The largest errors occurred between 1919 and 1922, as the Federal Reserve struggled to
construct an effective reporting system and increase the number of firms from which it collected
data. After 1923, quality improved. The magnitude of errors decreased. And, the initial reports
became a better indication of the state of the economy.
The data that we introduce in this essay enhances our understanding of consumption
during the Great Depression. Temin (1976) asserts that a collapse of autonomous consumption
caused the initial contraction in output, which subsequently decreased the demand for money and
the equilibrium money stock. Romer (1990) argues that the stock market crash created
immediate income uncertainty resulting in a decline in the purchase of consumer durables.
Greasly, Madsen, Oxley (2001) argue that uncertainty reduced nondurable spending as well. Our
new data series seems consistent with these claims and provides data needed to test these

29

theories and other hypothesis with the inter-district variation that existed during the Great
Depression.
