ABSTRACT
We develop a dynamic multi-country general equilibrium model to investigate forces acting on the
global economy during the Great Recession and ensuing recovery. Our multi-sector framework accounts
completely for countries' trade, investment, production, and GDPs in terms of different sets of shocks.
Applying the model to 21 countries, we investigate the 29 percent drop in world trade in manufactures
during 2008-2009. A shift in final spending away from tradable sectors, largely caused by declines
in durables investment efficiency, account for most of the collapse in trade relative to GDP. Shocks
to trade frictions, productivity, and demand play minor roles.

Introduction

International trade in manufactures plunged 29 percent during the global recession of 2008-2009.
That trade would fall in line with other economic magnitudes such as GDP is perhaps not surprising, but, as shown in Figure 1, global trade fell 20 percent relative to global GDP.1 What
happened during the crisis that led trade to collapse?
Answering this question forces us to confront multiple dimensions of complexity surrounding
the global crisis. Some sectors and some countries were hit much harder than others. Trade fell,
but trade also played a role in transmitting shocks from one country to another.
To capture this geographical, sectoral, and temporal richness, we attack this question by
embedding a multi-sector general equilibrium model of international trade into a multi-country
real business cycle model. We divide economic activity into the manufacture of durables, the
manufacture of nondurables, construction, and everything else (called “services”). Only the
outputs of the first two sectors are tradable. Output of the durable manufacturing sector goes into
stocks of equipment while construction activity creates structures. The framework incorporates
economic geography, an input-output structure, and capital accumulation. With saving and
investment chosen optimally in each country, trade imbalances emerge endogenously. Quantifying
this framework, we use it to assess the contribution of different types of shocks occurring in
different countries to the collapse of trade.
Our framework attributes what happened to six types of country-specific shocks: (i) to the cost
of trade in each manufacturing sector between each pair of trading partners, (ii) to productivity in
each sector, (iii) to the efficiency of investment in each type of capital, (iv) to aggregate demand,
(v) to the demand for nondurable manufactures, and (vi) to employment.2 Through international
trade, shocks in one country have implications elsewhere. Through capital accumulation, past
shocks affect the future while, through their anticipation, future shocks affect the past.
We apply the framework to a period spanning the run-up to the recession through the end
1

We measure the drop from the third quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of 2009. The data are trade in
manufactures and GDP, both in current U.S. dollars. Appendix Figure A.1 plots trade in goods and services
relative to GDP for the four largest economies in the world: the United States, Japan, China, and Germany. In
2007 trade in manufactures constituted 68.6 percent of the total trade of the 20 countries in our study while in 2009
manufactures constituted 66.7 percent of their trade. Hence trade in manufactures was both the bulk of trade and
the largest participant in the trade collapse. We focus on trade in manufactures because we lack comprehensive
data on bilateral trade in services, while the small amount of trade in other merchandise, such as oil, is subject to
idiosyncratic forces outside the scope of our analysis.
2
Shocks (i) to (iii) are to technology, shocks (iv) and (v) are to preferences, and shocks (vi) are to endowments.
Since we don’t model trade in services, to respect accounting identities we introduce exogenous services deficits,
which we treat as transfers, as our seventh type of shock. While services deficits are exogenous, overall deficits
emerge as equilibrium outcomes. Services deficits turn out to play only a very small role in our quantitative
analysis.

of the subsequent recovery. We assemble quarterly data on nominal and real GDP as well as on
prices, production, and bilateral trade by sector for 21 countries (including Rest of World) that
encompass the entire globe. We apply our framework to these data to extract time series of the
different shocks over the period from 2000 to 2012.
Our model embeds a gravity equation for trade in each manufacturing sector, which allows
us to extract shocks to trade costs using movements in bilateral trade shares and prices. We
apply the dual to extract shocks to total factor productivity in each sector using output and
input prices and, for the two traded sectors, the import share. We extract shocks to the efficiency
of investment in each type of capital to reconcile data on investment spending with the model’s
implication for the dynamics of the capital stock. Our assumption of complete markets allows us
to back out shocks to demand from shifts in consumption spending across countries and in the
composition of consumption spending within countries. Since we treat labor as exogenous, we
take the labor shock directly from data on changes in employment.
If we feed in all the shocks, the dynamic solution of our model will reproduce exactly the
quarterly data on GDP, prices, production, and trade in each country. Instead, we introduce
various subsets of these shocks and run dynamic general equilibrium counterfactuals to address
two questions:3 What type of shocks drove what happened? Where did these shocks originate?
We look not only at trade, but also at manufacturing production and GDP around the world.
Several results stand out.
Declines in the efficiency of investment in durable manufactures, an intensively traded sector,
were the major driver of the overall collapse in trade, as well as the decline in manufacturing
production, during the global recession. The efficiency of investment in durables for the world as
a whole plummeted at an annual rate of 23 percent during the recession, having been quite flat
in the eight years before. These declines shifted final spending away from durables toward the
nontraded sectors. A counterfactual with these shocks on their own generates almost two-thirds
of the collapse in global trade relative to GDP.
Moreover, cross-country differences in these shocks were the primary determinant of crosscountry variation in the declines both in trade and in manufacturing production. For example,
China was the only country that experienced growth in durables investment efficiency during the
recession and was also the country with the mildest decline in durables trade and the largest
3
Just as growth accounting uses a theoretical framework to decompose output growth into factor accumulation
and the Solow residual, we use our model to decompose changes in output, trade, and prices into our sets of
shocks. Unlike growth accounting, however, evaluating the contribution of individual shocks requires solving a
counterfactual equilibrium, as in the Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2007) “wedges” approach to closed-economy
business-cycle accounting.

increase in durables production. At the other extreme, Romania and Spain had the steepest
declines in durables investment efficiency and among the steepest declines in durables trade. Our
results complement the literature, discussed below, pointing to the importance of investment
efficiency shocks in quantitative business cycle models.
Other types of shocks made more modest contributions to the trade collapse. Declines in the
demand for nondurable manufactures (also highly traded) shifted expenditures toward services,
which are not traded. Higher trade frictions in a few large countries, such as China and the
United States, led them to source a larger share of their traded goods domestically.
Productivity in nontraded sectors generally declined, but for tradable sectors productivity
often rose. Productivity shocks therefore had little impact on global trade. Increases in a country’s
aggregate demand raise spending on consumption of nondurables and services there, leading to
higher factor prices, lower exports, higher imports, and higher GDP relative to other countries.
Such shocks had a limited impact on trade during the recession, but were the primary source of
fluctuations in relative GDPs.4
The global nature of the trade collapse was primarily the result of simultaneous declines in
investment efficiency in many countries. The extent to which an individual country was affected
depended both on the severity of the decline domestically and its severity in major export markets.
We find, for example, that if the United States had not itself experienced directly the shocks
underlying the global recession, its limited amount of trade would have shielded it from shocks
originating elsewhere. For Germany, in contrast, we find that shutting down its own shocks would
have barely mitigated its production slowdown. Its trading relationships with the rest of the world
meant that shocks elsewhere played a significant role in its downturn.
Unlike the decline of trade during 2008-2009, its recovery during 2009-2011 reflected a more
balanced contribution of several sets of shocks. Reduced trade frictions played the largest role.
The partial recovery in the efficiency of investment in durables was the second most important
contributor to the trade recovery, followed by shocks to demand for nondurables. By 2012,
however, global trade had leveled off below its pre-recession peak.
Finally, we ask how our shocks account for fluctuations in real GDP. Shocks to productivity
in nontraded sectors and shocks to labor supply had the greatest impact. Hence we attribute the
decline in real GDP during the global recession primarily to a different set of shocks (productivity
and labor supply) than those most responsible for the decline in trade and in manufacturing
4

We report all nominal values in terms of nominal global GDP. We use the term relative GDP (or simply GDP
if there is no ambiguity) to mean a country’s nominal GDP translated into U.S. dollars relative to the dollar value
of global GDP. To distinguish this concept from that of real GDP, we use the term real GDP when referring to
this second concept.

production (investment efficiency).
Our paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature while Section 3 provides
an overview of the data. Section 4 presents our model, deriving equilibrium relationships from
the solution to a global planner’s problem. In Section 5 we show how the equilibrium links
observable outcomes to underlying shocks. Section 6 describes how to extract these shocks from
data on GDP, production, trade, and prices. Section 7 then uses the model to conduct a set of
counterfactuals which identify the role of different types of shocks in the global recession. Section
8 concludes.

Related Literature

Our work bridges several literatures. First, our results complement various papers investigating the forces driving the trade collapse during the global recession. Second, our methodology
contributes to efforts to integrate quantitative models in macroeconomics and in international
trade.

2.1

The Trade Collapse

Baldwin (2009) serves as a forum in which a number of researchers put forth various hypotheses
for why trade plummeted. Explanations fall into several categories. One attributes the collapse
to forces increasing barriers to trade, captured in our analysis by trade friction shocks. The
literature points to two specific trade barriers. Since a banking crisis was a major component of
the global recession, several authors, including Amiti and Weinstein (2011) and Chor and Manova
(2011), blame the trade collapse on tightening trade credit. Others, including Brock (2009), cite
increased protectionism.
Another literature has attributed the collapse in trade to the differential impact of the recession
on different sectors of the economy.5 A third hypothesis put forth in Eichengreen (2009) and Yi
(2009) is that international vertical supply chains disintegrated.
In their survey, Bems, Johnson, and Yi (2013) write “The key to understanding how trade
can fall more than GDP lies in understanding how asymmetries in expenditure changes across
sectors map to international trade. The global recession saw large declines in spending on final
goods (as opposed to services), specifically durable goods.” They conclude that the composition
of expenditures played a critical role in the collapse and that trade finance and protectionism
5

See, for example, Levchenko, Lewis, and Tesar (2010) for a detailed analysis of the United States, Behrens,
Corcos, and Mion (2013) for Belgium, Bricongne, Fontagne, Gaulier, Taglioni, and Vicard (2011) for France, and
Bems, Johnson, and Yi (2010) for an analysis of multi-country trade and production data.

did not. Our bottom line largely supports their conclusion. We attribute 64 percent of the trade
collapse to negative shocks to the efficiency of investment in durables and 18 percent to declines in
demand for nondurables, both of which shift spending away from tradable goods. Trade frictions
account for roughly 11 percent of the decline in global trade relative to GDP. What our analysis
adds is the ability to trace outcomes in general equilibrium for any country or sector to shocks
emanating from any country or sector.

2.2

Macroeconomics and Trade

Our work relates to a large open-economy macroeconomics literature that studies the behavior of
trade, predominantly using dynamic two-country models. Stockman and Tesar (1995) highlight
the importance of shocks to intertemporal preferences while Boileau (1999) and Engel and Wang
(2011) explain the greater volatility of trade by recognizing that a large share of what is traded
consists of durable intermediates rather than final goods.6 Alessandria, Kaboski, and Midrigan
(2010a,b) develop dynamic two-country models in which inventories play a central role. Leibovici
and Waugh (2012) emphasize the time-to-ship friction for explaining trade dynamics, while investment shocks play a critical role in Boileau (2002), Erceg, Guerrieri, and Gust (2008), and
Jacob and Peersman (2013).7
Our methodology builds on a literature that studies the role of trade barriers in segmenting
financial markets as well as goods markets. A pioneering paper by Obstfeld and Rogoff (2001)
provides a series of stylized models of the world economy in which trade barriers separate individual countries subject to individual shocks. Their analysis is limited to two countries, so is not
amenable to realistic quantification. Dekle, Eaton, and Kortum (2007, 2008) and Eaton, Kortum,
Neiman, and Romalis (2011) develop multi-country models that can be confronted with the rich
data on bilateral trade, but their models are static and treat deficits and shocks to the demand
for tradables as exogenous.
Alvarez and Lucas (2009) and Fitzgerald (2012) also embed multi-country models with trade
barriers into explicitly dynamic frameworks. Alvarez and Lucas study transition dynamics and
steady state responses to tariff changes in a model with balanced trade. Fitzgerald tests for
asset-market completeness and, among rich counties, is unable to reject it. We push our frame6

Kose and Yi (2001), Ambler, Cardia, and Zimmermann (2004), Huang and Liu (2007), Arkolakis and Ramanarayanan (2009), and Johnson (2014) address the role of trade in intermediates for business cycle transmission
and for the correlation of consumption across countries.
7
Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Huffman (1988) introduce shocks to investment efficiency. A large subsequent
literature in closed-economy macroeconomics identifies such shocks as a major driver of aggregates, particularly of
investment, over the business cycle. See, for instance, Fisher (2006), Justiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti (2010,
2011), Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2012), and Jurado (2015).

work much further, adapting it to measure the shocks hitting the world economy, to assess their
contributions to the global recession, and to track their transmission across countries.
The real business cycle literature has sought to uncover the ergodic processes driving business
cycles over a long horizon. We zero in on one episode, the recent global recession and recovery.
We consequently adopt the business-cycle-accounting strategy of Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan
(2007), which extracts from the data the exact realizations of each of a set of shocks. Given that
our analysis incorporates many countries and sectors, applying the states-of-nature approach as in
Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2007) would be infeasible. Instead we adopt the perfect-foresight
methodology used by Kehoe, Ruhl, and Steinberg (2014) in their study of the joint dynamics of
employment in the traded sector and the U.S. trade deficit.

A First Look at the Data

Along with the collapse of trade, other features of the global recession were a decline in construction and a drop in manufacturing production. The long-dashed line in Figure 1 shows that
construction didn’t start its persistent slide until 2009:Q2. By contrast, trade and manufacturing production both fell sharply after 2008:Q3 and rebounded after 2009:Q2. For the purposes of
studying the trade collapse we thus identify the period 2008:Q3 to 2009:Q2 as the global recession.
During these quarters global manufacturing production (plotted with the short-dashed line
in Figure 1) fell by 13 percent while global trade in manufactures (plotted with the sold line)
declined by an even larger 20 percent. To what extent was the sharper decline in trade due to
compositional effects between countries or between durable and nondurable manufacturing within
countries?
To perform the first component of this decomposition, we divide the world into the 21 countries
listed in Table 1.8 We can account for nearly half (49 percent) of the decline in manufacturing
trade relative to manufacturing production with the relatively larger declines in production in
(mostly smaller) countries with higher ratios of trade to production.9
8

The data shown in the table are for 2008:Q3, the base period before the global trade collapse. Not including
Rest of World, the other 20 countries comprise nearly three-fourths of global GDP. Appendix Section A describes
the data used here and throughout the paper.
9
We decompose the global decline in the ratio of trade to production in manufactures into within and between
country effects as follows. Let TnM be trade in manufactures and YnM production of manufactures in country
n = 1, ..., N . The decomposition is:

As for the second component, Engel and Wang (2011) and Levchenko, Lewis, and Tesar
(2010) point out that durables, which were particularly hard hit during the recession, are more
intensively traded. During the recession, the ratio of trade to production was 31 percent for
durables compared with 22 percent for nondurables, and the share of durables in total production
declined by 2.2 percentage points during the recession.10 Combining this sectoral reallocation
with the country reallocation discussed above, we find that compositional effects account for 60
percent of the decline in global trade relative to global production.
In Figure 2(a), we separately plot each country’s change in durables trade and production (in
solid squares) and nondurables trade and production (in hollow circles). (Here and in what follows
we report changes as the value at the end of the period divided by the value at the beginning of
the period. Hence no change delivers 1.) Several points stand out. First, the declines in trade
and manufacturing production were widespread. Second, the declines in trade and production for
durables were almost always more pronounced than for nondurables. Third, where production
fell more trade fell more. Figure 2(b) plots the corresponding changes during the recovery from
the recession, which we define as 2009:Q2 to 2011:Q1. The picture is largely a mirror image of
the recession.
Several authors have examined the role of construction in the global recession.11 Figure
2(c) plots changes in construction against manufacturing production both in the recession and
recovery. Where construction declined at all, it never fell more than production. Remarkably, for
most countries construction failed to rebound during the recovery, with many countries, including
Greece, Spain, and the United States, experiencing declines even more extreme than during the
recession.
Finally, Figure 2(d) compares changes in countries’ real GDPs with changes in their relative
GDPs during the recession and recovery. During the recession real GDP declined in most countries
by from three to six percent. China, India, and Poland are the only countries where real GDP
grew. Changes in relative GDP were more extreme, with China, Japan, and the United States
displaying the largest increases.12 Not only did real global activity decline in the recession, there
was also a major cross-country realignment in incomes.

Appendix Table A.1 lists the industries we classify as durable and nondurable manufactures (as well as
construction and services).

Charles, Hurst, and Notowidigdo (2013) look at U.S. manufacturing and construction employment while
Hoffmann and Lemieux (2014) compare construction employment in Canada, Germany, and the United States.

These changes in relative GDPs, of course, in part reflect the appreciations of the Chinese renminbi, the
Japanese yen, and the U.S. dollar in this period.

The Model

We now turn from the data to our dynamic multi-country model in which durable and nondurable
manufactures take center stage, with a role for construction as well. We then return to these data
to quantify our model in order to isolate the factors driving the global collapse of trade and
production during the recession.

4.1

Technology

We first describe the static technology for production at any date. We then turn to how investment
connects endowments of capital across time.
4.1.1

The Static Framework

Our static framework builds on the trade models of Eaton and Kortum (2002), Alvarez and Lucas
(2007), and Dekle, Eaton, and Kortum (2008).13 The economy has n = 1, ..., N countries each
with four sectors: construction (C), durable manufactures (D), nondurable manufactures (N ),
and services (S).14 We let Ω = {C, D, N, S} denote the set of all sectors.
k
of
In addition to its labor endowment Ln,t , at any date t country n has an endowment Kn,t

capital of type k ∈ ΩK = {C, D}. At any date households and firms consume the services of
these stocks of capital. The output of sectors k ∈ ΩK can serve as investment to build these
stocks of capital. In addition, each sector j ∈ Ω uses the output of each sector as intermediate
inputs. Outputs of nondurables and services (Ω∗K , the complement of ΩK ) are also used directly
for consumption.
In each sector, total output is a CES aggregate (with elasticity of substitution σ) of the outputs
of a unit continuum of goods (a separate one for each sector) indexed by z ∈ [0, 1].15 Country
n’s efficiency ajn,t (z) at making good z in sector j is the realization of a random variable ajn,t with
distribution:

13

Papers that have introduced interindustry interaction into this framework include Shikher (2011) and Caliendo
and Parro (2015).
14
When we connect the model to data, services will represent the largest share of the S sector, although it also
includes agriculture and commodities such as petroleum and other raw materials.
15
Our analysis would emerge largely unscathed if we modelled output of each sector in each country as homogeneous but differentiated according to source, as in Armington. Our approach does not require specifying
production technology as requiring inputs classified by both sector and provenance.

country n’s overall productivity in sector j. The parameter θ is an inverse measure of the dispersion of efficiencies.16
Production of good z in each sector combines the services of labor, the services of each type
of capital, and intermediates from each of the four sectors. Technology is Cobb-Douglas with
constant returns to scale. The output elasticities in country n and sector j of labor, capital of
0

type k, and intermediates from sector j 0 are given by βnL,j , βnK,jk , and βnM,jj for j, j 0 ∈ Ω, k ∈ ΩK .
As has been standard in trade models since Ricardo, the endowments of labor and capital are
not traded. Trade in the outputs of the four sectors incurs standard iceberg trade costs, so that
delivering one unit of a good from country i to country n requires shipping djni,t ≥ 1 units, with
djnn,t = 1. We treat sectors l ∈ ΩT = {D, N } as tradable so that dlni,t are finite. Construction is
not traded and we treat services as nontraded, so that for sectors j ∈ Ω∗T = {C, S} we treat djni,t
as infinite for i 6= n.

costs, and δ k is the depreciation rate. In introducing shocks to the efficiency of investment we
follow recent developments in the business cycle literature described in Section 2.2. Setting αk < 1
means that investment is less efficient when done in a large amount relative to the stock of capital,
as in Lucas and Prescott (1971).

Market Structure and the Planner’s Problem

Markets are perfectly competitive and complete. Foresight is perfect. Since there are no market
failures, we can reformulate the problem, following Lucas and Prescott (1971), and solve for the
market allocation as the solution to a world planner’s problem.
The world planner assigns a weight ωn to the representative consumer in country n. We

Equilibrium Relationships

Appendix Section B sets up the planner’s problem as one of intertemporal constrained optimization. The solution, together with the distributional assumption (1), delivers simple expressions
for sectoral allocations and the shadow prices on the associated constraints. We interpret the
appropriate shadow prices, for each country n at each date t, as a price index pjn,t for absorption
k
for each type of capital. With this reinterin sector j, a wage to labor wn,t , and a rental rate rn,t

pretation of the relevant shadow prices as competitive prices, we turn to the expressions that we
take to the data.

A Stationary State

In a stationary state Ψ is constant and the capital stocks have settled down to constant levels
Knk . In this case the Euler equations (10) and capital accumulation equations (2) determine, for

where the absence of a time subscript indicates a stationary value. The stationary values of the
other endogenous variables follow from (5) through (14).

Shocks and Outcomes

A common solution technique is to linearize the model around this stationary state. We instead
solve the model exactly, after expressing it in changes, as in Dekle, Eaton, and Kortum (2007,
2008).19 For any variable x we define its change as x̂t+1 = xt+1 /xt . Expressing the model in
k

Connecting Outcomes to Shocks

Shocks have both direct effects and indirect effects through changes in prices and factor costs. If
shocks are anticipated, they have an effect on prior outcomes, and, even if they are temporary,
their effects linger in capital. We can use equations (16) through (23) to examine their direct
impact.
To get insight into the implications of shocks irrespective of where they occur, consider first a
type of shock hitting worldwide, eliminating any geographic dimension: (i) From (16), increases
in trade costs dˆjni,t+1 (meaning dˆjni,t+1 > 1 for n 6= i) reduce import shares within sector j
as countries divert sourcing from abroad to home. (ii) From (18), increases in productivity
Âjn,t+1 lower the sectoral price index for sector j output relative to input costs. (iii) From (22),
increases in the efficiency of investment χ̂kn,t+1 raise investment spending in sector k. (iv) From
N
(19), increases in demand for nondurable consumption ψ̂n,t+1
shift spending from (nontradable)

services to (tradable) nondurable manufactures. (v) Increases in labor supply L̂n,t+1 show up in
17

(22), generating an offsetting decline in wages.
N
and in investment efficiency in durables
Increases in demand for nondurable consumption ψ̂n,t+1

χ̂D
n,t+1 raise spending on tradables at the expense of nontradables. Overall trade goes up even if
the share of trade within the sector doesn’t change.
Since we restrict the φn,t ’s to average to one, shocks to aggregate demand φ̂n,t+1 can’t be
worldwide. An increase in φ̂n,t+1 for country n acts to increase n’s spending on nontraded goods,
which raises its factor prices and hence its absorption and its GDP relative to the rest of the
world. Its imports rise and its exports fall.20
We can also consider the effect of other shocks when they occur in one country in isolation.
As in the classic Dornbusch, Fischer, and Samuelson (1977) model, an increase in productivity
Âjn,t+1 in a tradable sector j lowers country n’s cost of producing varieties in that sector. The
relative wage in country n rises as does the range of sector j varieties it produces and exports.
An increase in country n’s labor supply L̂n,t+1 lowers its wage but also increases the range of
varieties it produces and exports. An increase in investment efficiency χ̂D
n,t+1 increases country
n’s production and imports of durables. In line with the Lerner symmetry theorem, an increase
in country n’s trade costs as an importer dˆjni,t+1 or as an exporter dˆjin,t+1 (for all i 6= n) lowers
both country n’s imports and its exports.
An issue in the literature on real business cycles (see, e.g., Stockman and Tesar, 1995) has
been the observed negative comovement of GDP and the trade balance. An increase in durables
productivity ÂD
n,t+1 in country n raises both its GDP and its trade balance. In contrast, an
increase in aggregate demand φ̂n,t+1 or in durables investment efficiency χ̂D
n,t+1 raises GDP but
lowers the trade balance, in line with the data.
A country-specific increase in ÂD
n,t+1 raises output of durables in the affected country while
decreasing it elsewhere, generating negative comovement in durables output across countries. In
contrast, a country-specific increase in χ̂D
n,t+1 raises durables output everywhere, creating positive
comovement.
In most cases we find the news effect of a shock, the period before it materializes, to be in
the same direction but much smaller in magnitude than the effect on impact. Major exceptions
are with country-specific increases in productivity ÂD
n,t+1 and in investment efficiency in durables
χ̂D
n,t+1 . Both production and absorption rise on impact, but contract the period before, as agents
20

We base our description of the effects of country-specific shocks on exercises described in Appendix Section
C. We perturb the stationary state of the model and compute the impulse response. Agents learn of the shock
one period in advance. We consider both temporary and permanent changes (in levels). A 25 percent permanent
increase in the level of shock s in period t + 1 means setting ŝt+1 = 1.25 and ŝτ = 1 for τ 6= t + 1. A 25 percent
temporary increase means setting ŝt+1 = 1.25, ŝt+2 = 1/1.25, and ŝτ = 1 for τ 6= t + 1, t + 2. In the experiments we
describe, temporary and permanent changes have qualitatively similar effects, so we don’t discuss each separately.

18

delay investment until the subsequent period when durables will be cheaper or contribute more
to the capital stock.

6

Quantification

To quantify the model, we need to calibrate the parameters, solve for the paths of capital stocks,
and back out the shocks. We apply the procedure to quarterly data from the 21 countries
j
appearing in Table 1, from 2000:Q1 to 2012:Q4.21 We take (in levels) series corresponding to Xn,t
j
F,j
S
l
and Yn,t
for j ∈ Ω (and hence Xn,t
and Dn,t
) as well as πni,t
for l ∈ ΩT . We take (in changes)

series corresponding to L̂n,t+1 and p̂jn,t+1 .

6.1

Parameter Values

We now discuss our calibration of the parameters in Θ. We set the quarterly discount factor
ρ = 0.987 to be consistent with a real interest rate of 5 percent per year. We set the trade
elasticity θ = 2 to be between the smaller values typically used in the open-economy macro
literature, such as in Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland (1995), and the larger values used in the trade
literature, such as in Eaton and Kortum (2002).22 We choose αC = 0.5 and αD = 0.55. (A larger
αj means lower capital adjustment costs.) We choose δ C = 0.011 to correspond to an annual
depreciation rate for structures of 4 percent, a value in between that used by Krusell, Ohanian,
Rios-Rull, and Violante (2000) and the U.S. BEA’s measured rate of depreciation in private
structures in 2008. We choose δ D = 0.026 to correspond to an annual durables depreciation rate
of 10 percent.
To calibrate preference parameters ψ C and ψ D we assume that the world as a whole is close
to a stationary state. For each country, the stationary state relationship (15), together with (23),
becomes:

Data from China and France become available in 2006:Q1.
The response to a trade friction shock of a given size depends crucially on the value of the trade elasticity θ.
Our counterfactuals, however, are based on shocks to trade costs that are extracted given θ. Thus we will extract
larger shocks to trade costs if we impose a smaller value of θ. As a consequence, our main results for the recession
are, for the most part, insensitive to θ. As discussed below, we report alternative results for the case of θ = 0.5 in
the Appendix.

ψ C = 0.33, which is within one percent of the average annual expenditure share of housing in the
2008 U.S. consumer expenditure survey, and ψ D = 0.08.
We calculate the input-output coefficients using the most recent available table for each country in the 2009 edition of the OECD’s input-output tables.23 To calculate βnL,j we divide compensation of employees in sector j by that sector’s total output. We measure capital’s share of
output as value added less compensation of employees divided by total output in sector j. We
assume that nonresidential structures represent 43 percent of the business sector’s capital share,
βnK,jC /(βnK,jC + βnK,jD ) = 0.43, consistent with Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Krusell (1997). To

determine βnM,jj we divide total spending in sector j on inputs from sector j 0 by sector j’s total
output.

6.2

Paths of Capital

To extract the baseline shocks {Ψ̂t+1 } during the period of our analysis (2000:Q1 to 2012:Q4), we
k
over that period. Computing
need to know the paths of the changes in the capital stocks K̂n,t+1
k
the associated baseline paths of the K̂n,t+1
in turn requires assumptions about the {Ψ̂t+1 } beyond

the period of our data. We denote the period at which our data end, 2012:Q4, as tE and freeze
the levels of all subsequent shocks at their 2012:Q4 values. That is, Ψ̂s = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, DtSE } for
s > tE .
This world with unchanging shocks converges to the stationary state described in Section 4.6
in which all endogenous magnitudes are constant. Appendix Section C describes our algorithm

our data for the period of 2000:Q1 to 2012:Q4.

Values of Shocks

Tables 2 to 4 summarize the baseline shocks. We report the average change in the shocks for each
country during the quarters leading up to 2008:Q3, during the period we identify as the global
recession, 2008:Q3 to 2009:Q2, and during the period we identify as the trade recovery, 2009:Q2
to 2011:Q1. All figures are annualized.
We start in Table 2, which summarizes the behavior of trade frictions. Since there are 420
trade friction shocks dˆlni in each tradable sector, one for each ordered pair of separate countries,
we report only a trade-weighted average for each country (as both exporter and importer).28
The world as a whole experienced a mild decline in its trade frictions prior to the recession, as
shown by the values 0.991 and 0.980 for dˆD and dˆN . This decline continued during the recession.

in the stationary state. We find little quantitative and no qualitative effect on our results.

the recession, particularly for durables.29 At the same time, some countries appear to have
experienced large declines in trade frictions. (The higher variation in changes in trade frictions
during the recession relative to other periods partly reflects its brevity.) The decline in overall
trade barriers accelerated during the recovery. Only Greece missed this trend.
Table 2 also reports each country’s services deficit and labor shocks. Services deficits decline
for 17 of our 21 countries in the recession, reflecting in part the fact that most of them are oil
importers, and oil prices fell in this period. By construction, there is never a services deficit for the
world. World employment, calculated as the GDP-weighted average across countries, increased
by 1 percent in the pre-recession period but fell by nearly 2 percent during the recession, with no
overall reversal in the recovery. The countries with the largest negative labor shocks during the
recession were Spain and the United States.
Table 3 shows that most countries experienced declines in construction productivity in the
recession, with the world average dropping to 0.934 from a previously flat trajectory. These
productivity losses were reversed during the recovery. Services productivity followed a similar
pattern, but with slower growth in the recovery. In contrast, productivity in both manufacturing
sectors grew faster during the recession in many countries.30
Table 4 shows that there was only a mild worldwide decline in investment efficiency in construction during the recession. The increases in China and Japan largely offset small declines in
most countries. The recovery period looks similar.
What most dramatically separates the recession from surrounding periods is the decline in
31
investment efficiency in durables, χ̂D
In the pre-recession period,
n,t+1 < 1, also shown in Table 4.

these shocks are tightly centered around 1. The world as a whole experienced a decline in durables
investment efficiency of 22.8 percent during the recession. This decline was widespread, with the
only increase occurring in China, at a rate slightly below its pre-recession average. For most
countries these declines in efficiency in durables investment were only partially reversed in the
recovery, with Denmark and Greece experiencing substantial further drops.
The modest increase in trade frictions for durables that Table 2 reports for the United States (dˆD
US = 1.004)
masks a substantial increase for imports (1.182) and decrease for exports (0.855). Using our value of θ = 2, the
implied impact on the U.S. import share in durables (in logs) is −θ ln 1.182 = −0.334. This result is in line with
Levchenko, Lewis, and Tesar (2010)’s “wedge” decomposition of U.S. imports during 2008:Q2-2009:Q2. Their
wedge is a residual from an import demand equation imposing price elasticities  of 1.5 and 6. Their  corresponds
to our θ + 1. Taking a weighted average of their results for durables consistent with  = 3 (θ = 2) delivers a
reduction in the durables import share of −0.251, slightly less extreme than what we find. Appendix Section D
further explores the connection between Levchenko, Lewis, and Tesar (2010) and what we do.
30
As discussed in Appendix Section A.5, we can use Domar (1961) weights to aggregate our sectoral productivities into an economy-wide productivity shock. Appendix Figure A.2 compares our aggregate measure for the
United States with the quarterly TFP series for the U.S. business sector in Fernald et al. (2012). The two series
align quite well and have a correlation of 0.78.
31
We calculate the global χ̂j shock as investment-spending weighted averages of the country shocks.
29

23

Declines in nondurables demand largely match the declines in durable investment efficiency,
with the steepest drops in Denmark, Italy, Romania, Spain, and the United States. As we show
in the next section, however, since nondurables is a smaller sector than durables, the shocks to
nondurables demand had less overall effect.
Finally, Table 4 reports the aggregate demand shocks. China and Japan exhibit the largest
increases and Poland and Romania the largest decreases. Note that the United States also
experienced a positive aggregate demand shock.32 By construction, this shock has no global
component.

6.5

Forces at Work in the Recession and Recovery

As described in Section 3, a major feature of the global recession was the widespread collapse
in trade and in manufacturing production, particularly in durables. This collapse was reversed
in the recovery. Construction activity also fell in the recession, but continued to fall during the
recovery. The magnitude of the changes varied substantially by country. Another striking feature
of the recession was the big realignment of GDPs.
How do our shocks explain these outcomes? Globally, the biggest shocks in the recession were
the drops in investment efficiency in durables and in the final demand for nondurables, each of
which plummeted by 22.8 percent. Declines in investment efficiency χ̂D
n,t+1 and in the demand
N
for nondurable consumption ψ̂n,t+1
lowered spending in these sectors. As spending shifted into

nontraded sectors, trade and manufacturing production fell. Trade frictions limited the geographic
scope of the shocks. Where the shocks were more pronounced, so were the reductions in imports
and in manufacturing production.
Table 4 suggests that shocks to aggregate demand φ̂n,t+1 , whose average around the world is
constrained to equal one in any period, were much more dispersed during the global recession
than before. Equation (30) shows the tight connection between final spending on nondurables
and on services, a large share of total spending, and aggregate demand shocks φ̂n,t+1 . As shown
below, these shocks accounted for the large swings in relative GDPs during the recession, plotted
on the vertical axis of Figure 2(d).
If anything, trade frictions dˆj

32

Aggregate demand shocks are largely picking up changes in relative GDPs, driven largely by swings in
exchange rates. During the recession the Japanese yen appreciated substantially against the U.S. dollar while the
dollar appreciated modestly against the euro.

7

Counterfactuals

Having backed out the shocks that account fully for the changes that occurred from 2008:Q3
to 2012:Q4, we can ask how to assign responsibility for the collapse of trade during the global
recession and for the subsequent recovery. To do so we consider how the world would have evolved
in a counterfactual in which only one set of shocks is active, shutting down other shocks by fixing
them at their 2008:Q2 level.
Within the period of our counterfactuals, we focus separately on the global recession, 2008:Q3
to 2009:Q2, and the recovery, 2009:Q2 to 2011:Q1.33 If a counterfactual with a particular type of
shock delivers an evolution similar to what’s in the data, we attribute what happened to these
shocks. If the evolution implied by a counterfactual is quite different from the data, we conclude
that these shocks were not major players.

7.1

Computation

To compute a counterfactual, we need to take a stand on how agents foresee the future. Since
we back out baseline shocks under an assumption of perfect foresight, any counterfactual is a
surprise. We assume that the surprise occurs in 2008:Q3, on the eve of the trade collapse, with
agents acting as if they have perfect foresight of the counterfactual shocks at that point but not
before.34 A consequence of this assumption is that, in a counterfactual, the Euler equation (22)
holds for changes from 2008:Q3 to 2008:Q4 and onward, but does not hold for the initial change
from 2008:Q2 to 2008:Q3. See Appendix Section C for a description of the numerical algorithm.

7.2

Global Trade

Figure 4 summarizes our main findings. It plots the path of global trade from 2000:Q2 to 2012:Q4
in the data as well as in counterfactuals with the following types of shocks acting in isolation:
(i) nondurables demand, (ii) aggregate demand, (iii) productivity in all sectors, (iv) investment
efficiency in durables, (v) investment efficiency in construction, (vi) trade frictions (combining
nondurables and durables), and (vii) services deficits.
Negative shocks to investment efficiency in durables are overwhelmingly the driver of the trade
collapse. Lower nondurables demand and higher trade frictions also contribute to the decline but
33

In reporting changes over multiple quarters, as with the shocks, we multiply the relevant quarterly changes
together. For instance, we look at changes over the recession by multiplying together the three quarterly changes
from 2008:Q3 to 2009:Q2. We report all counterfactual nominal outcomes relative to global GDP in that counterfactual.
34
We have also solved counterfactuals under the assumption that the surprise occurs in 2008:Q4. Some countrylevel dynamics differ, but our conclusions about the drivers of the global trade collapse do not change.

25

play a modest role. Other shocks contribute little or nothing.35
To be more quantitative, the first row of Table 5 reports the contributions of each different
type of shock to the cumulative decline in world trade over the recession. Shocks to investment
efficiency in durables account for 64 percent (i.e., 13.2 percentage points) of the 20.5 percent
decline in world trade. Declines in demand for nondurable manufactures contribute 18 percent
and increases in trade frictions contribute 11 percent to the decline.36 (The contributions from
each type of shock need not and do not exactly sum to one.)
The recovery in trade, as evident in Figure 4, is not just a reversal of these forces. A rise
in investment efficiency in durables is a major component of the recovery but declining trade
frictions play an even larger role. (See Appendix Table A.5 for details.)

7.3

Country-Level Results by Type of Shock

To what extent do our findings about the contributions of these forces at the world level across
time carry over to explaining variation across countries? Table 5 reports, for each of our 21
countries, the change in trade from 2008:Q3 to 2009:Q2 generated by different types of shocks.
The decline in investment efficiency in durables delivered a big hit to every country’s trade,
with demand for nondurables playing a more modest role. Trade frictions were important for a
few countries. In China and India trade frictions and investment efficiency in durables contribute
about equally to the (relatively modest) trade declines there.
Figure 5 illustrates how different sets of shocks explain the decline in trade in the cross section.
The figure plots the change in trade accounted for by various sets of shocks (on the y-axis) against
a country’s actual change in trade (on the x-axis). Hence the horizontal line at one corresponds
to no change in the counterfactual and the 45-degree line to the actual change. Note that only
shocks to investment efficiency in durables investment strongly covary with the declines in trade.
Figure 6 shows the analogous results for manufacturing production during the recession.
Shocks to investment efficiency in durables were primarily responsible for the declines in most
countries. Combined shocks to aggregate and nondurable demand also played important roles in
the declines in Greece, Italy, Japan, Romania, Spain, and the United States. As shown in Appendix Table A.2, positive productivity shocks (across durables and nondurables) drove China’s
and India’s substantial rise in manufacturing production. The main message, though, is that
35

The story for production (shown in Appendix Figure A.4) is similar, except trade frictions play no role.
Using a trade elasticity of θ = 0.5, these results remain largely unchanged. Durables investment efficiency
shocks and nondurables demand shocks in this case explain 65 percent and 17 percent of the decline, respectively.
The biggest difference with the baseline case is that with the lower value of θ, the contribution of trade frictions
to the trade collapse increases from 11 to 16 percent. Further results for the case of θ = 0.5 can be found in
Appendix Figures A.5 to A.7 and Appendix Tables A.12 to A.14.
36

26

shocks to investment efficiency in durables were the main driver of the decline in both trade and
in manufacturing production relative to global GDP across the world during the global recession.
Changes in relative GDP are a different story, as shown in Figure 7 and in Appendix Table A.3.
Aggregate demand shocks are the primary mover here, except for China and India, where, again,
productivity (not pictured) is the source of their relative GDP growth. Shocks to investment
efficiency in construction contributed to the declines in Mexico and Poland and to the moderate
increases in China and Japan.
Another outcome of interest is the decline of each country’s trade relative to its own GDP.
Figure 8 shows what happens to these ratios with shocks only to investment efficiency, to demand
for nondurables, and to aggregate demand. Together these shocks generate most of the decline
and the cross-country variation in the ratio of trade to GDP, leaving little room for trade frictions
or productivity.
Which sets of shocks drove the declines in real GDP during the recession? Productivity shocks,
emanating overwhelmingly from nontradables, drive outcomes for real GDP at the country and
world level, generating over 70 percent of the decline in global real GDP on their own. The decline
in labor contributes about 10 percent to the decline.37 Figure 9 shows that the combination of
shocks to productivity and to labor explain most of the cross-country differences in real GDP
during the recession.38
To summarize our results for the recession, not only was the drop in the efficiency of investment
in durables the major factor behind the collapse in global trade and manufacturing production,
it was the major factor for individual countries as well. Relative GDPs, on the other hand,
were driven primarily by demand shocks and secondarily by investment efficiency in construction.
Shocks to trade frictions, productivities, and services deficits do little. Shocks to productivity
and, to some extent, labor drove changes in real GDP.
During the recovery (2009:Q2 to 2011:Q1) trade bounced back everywhere except for Greece.
Appendix Table A.5 reports how our counterfactuals account for what happened. Decreased trade
frictions and, to a lesser extent, a rebound in durables investment efficiency were major factors,
with increases in the demand for nondurables also contributing.39
37

Labor was particularly important for the real GDP declines in Spain and the United States.
Appendix Table A.4 reports the behavior of real GDP in our main counterfactuals during the global recession.
39
Productivity and trade frictions were the most critical shocks generating real GDP growth during the recovery
(See Appendix Table A.8). That declining trade frictions would have a perceptible role in driving growth in real
GDP is surprising. An explanation is that, as shown in Appendix Table A.17, the share of purchases from home
producers fell substantially during the recovery. Applying the Arkolakis, Costinot, and Rodriguez-Clare (2011)
formula with θ = 2 to these drops implies large gains from trade. (With θ = 0.5 the gains are even larger.)
38

27

7.4

Cross-Border Transmission of Shocks

We now examine the geographic location of shocks rather than the type of shock. We first consider
what would have happened if shocks emanating only from the United States were at work. We
then consider whether outcomes in Germany were primarily the result of local or of foreign shocks.
7.4.1

The United States

As the world’s largest economy and as the country considered the epicenter of the financial crisis
that set off the global recession, to what extent was the collapse in global trade and manufacturing
production the consequence of shocks in the United States? Consider a counterfactual in which
only the United States experiences shocks, with shocks elsewhere set equal to one (and services
deficits fixed at their pre-recession levels).40 U.S. shocks alone reduce global trade by 3.6 percent,
as opposed to the actual decline of 20.5 percent, and reduce global manufacturing production by
2.9 percent, as opposed to the actual decline of 13.0 percent. As seen in Table 1, the United
States contributes about 12 percent of world trade and about 14 percent of world manufacturing
production. Hence, in either case, U.S. shocks by themselves reduce global trade and production
by about 50 percent more than their respective U.S. shares, reflecting how the world trading
system amplifies the effect of shocks.
Figure 10 shows the implications of U.S. shocks for individual countries. The decline in U.S.
demand for manufactures, both from the decline in investment efficiency in durables and from
the decline in demand for nondurables, dramatically reduces U.S. imports and manufacturing
production. U.S. exports actually increase substantially since we’ve eliminated the decline in
demand for manufactures elsewhere. Manufacturing production and exports decline in other
countries, most dramatically in Canada and Mexico. For these two countries U.S. shocks account
for most of the actual decline in exports. The decline in U.S. imports reduces manufacturing
production in Canada so much that Canadian imports fall as well. The effect on imports of other
countries is slightly positive as exports are diverted away from the United States and Canada
toward other destinations.
The opposite experiment in which only non-U.S. shocks are at work is mostly the mirror image.
Declines in the rest of the world are close to their actual ones, whereas, except for exports, the
U.S. is largely unscathed.
40

We include the actual shocks to trade frictions between the United States and other countries, while setting
trade friction shocks between pairs not including the United States equal to one. In order

Germany

The U.S. experiment may suggest that countries suffered primarily from home-grown shocks
during the recession. The equivalent experiment for Germany, however, shows how a country
much more exposed to world trade can suffer a significant decline in activity due solely to shocks
from abroad.
Figure 11 shows the result of a counterfactual in which only shocks not involving Germany
are at work. Note that there are only moderate changes from what actually happened, meaning
that much of what happened in Germany can be explained by shocks from elsewhere. German
imports, which remain at their pre-recession level, are the exception. Removing German shocks
only partly mitigates the effect of the recession on manufacturing production in Germany, Austria,
and Poland, on German GDP, and on the exports of Austria and Poland.

8

Conclusion

We find that a decline in the efficiency of investment in durable manufacturing capital stocks
drove the stunning collapse in trade and in manufacturing production that accompanied the
global recession. These shocks reduced final spending on tradable sectors. Our results thus
support the view that changes in the composition of demand, rather than higher trade barriers
or negative productivity shocks, led to the trade collapse.
Our model offers a way to analyze jointly the macroeconomic experiences of many countries
connected by trade. The framework allows us to identify where shocks originate and how they
spread from country to country, providing a richer picture of the common and idiosyncratic
characteristics of global fluctuations. It also suggests some promising avenues for future research,
both in terms of expanding the scope of this analysis and in terms of furthering the methodology.41
The analysis can readily be extended to include trade in services such as agriculture and,
particularly critical for macroeconomic fluctuations, oil. Also straightforward is adapting it to
incorporate additional factors of production and unemployment.42
Other extensions are more challenging. In assuming global asset market completeness, the
current framework eliminates any role for financial market frictions in creating or in propagat41

For example, Eaton, Kortum, and Neiman (2015) use the framework to run counterfactuals with greatly
reduced trade frictions to assess quantitatively the hypothesis in Obstfeld and Rogoff (2001) that trade costs are
the key drivers of major puzzles in international macroeconomics, such as the Feldstein and Horioka (1980) puzzle.
Reyes-Heroles (2015) uses a closely related framework to uncover the role of reduced trade barriers in driving huge
increases in trade imbalances.
42
Tombe (2014) and Lagakos and Waugh (2013) have integrated world food trade into a static general equilibrium framework. Farrokhi (2015) provides a quantitative general equilibrium model of world trade in crude and
refined oil. Eaton, Kortum, and Neiman (2013) introduce unemployment in a simple way.

ing macroeconomic fluctuations. In treating competition as perfect it rules out such phenomena
as pricing to market. In assuming perfect foresight, it rules out uncertainty or a richer treatment of the response to unexpected news. Incorporating asset market incompleteness, imperfect
competition, and uncertainty would allow the framework to address a much wider range of issues.
We have used the framework to disentangle the forces acting on the world economy over
the past decade, making a transparent but stark set of assumptions about shocks beyond the
horizon of our data. In providing this anatomy, therefore, the methodology does not provide a
window into the future. To use the framework to look forward requires a better understanding of
the time-series properties of the model’s underlying shocks, which are hard to discern from our
narrow window over this turbulent period. We await more data. These items point to a long road
ahead, but we think that our structure takes some useful first steps.

Table 2: Trade Frictions, Services Deficits, and Labor Supply Shocks
Notes: Global Recession is 2008:Q3 to 2009:Q2. Prior Period begins in 2000:Q1 with exceptions documented in Appendix Section A.
Recovery Period is 2009:Q2 to 2011:Q1. Shocks are annualized. Trade friction shocks are calculated as a trade-weighted average of the
bilateral shocks (see Footnote 28). The services trade deficit shocks are the changes in the deficits divided by GDP at the beginning of
the quarter, averaged over the period.

Table 4: Investment Efficiency and Demand Shocks
Notes: Global Recession is 2008:Q3 to 2009:Q2. Prior Period begins in 2000:Q1 with exceptions documented in Appendix Section A.
Recovery Period is 2009:Q2 to 2011:Q1. Shocks are annualized. Shocks to investment efficiency for the World are calculated as an
investment-weighted average of the country shocks (see Footnote 31). Shocks to aggregate and nondurables demand for the World are
calculated similarly, using overall consumption spending and nondurable consumption spending as weights.

Figure 7: Cross-Sectional Explanatory Power of Various Shocks for GDP during the Global Recession
Notes: The figures plot, against the actual changes in a country’s GDP during the three quarter recession, the changes that occur over
that period in a counterfactual exposed only to the path of the indicated shocks. All values are relative to global GDP.

Figure 10: Counterfactual Response to U.S. Shocks during the Global Recession
Notes: The figures plot, against the actual changes in a country’s imports, exports, production, and GDP during the three quarter
recession, the changes that occur over that period in a counterfactual exposed only to U.S. shocks. That is, we plot the counterfactual
response when labor, trade frictions, productivity, investment efficiency, demand, and services deficit shocks for the United States occur
as they did in the data, but where no other shocks occur.

Figure 11: Counterfactual Response to Shocks other than Germany’s during the Global Recession
Notes: The figures plot, against the actual changes in a country’s imports, exports, production, and GDP during the three quarter
recession, the changes that occur over that period in a counterfactual exposed only to shocks other than Germany’s. That is, we plot
the counterfactual response when labor, trade frictions, productivity, investment efficiency, demand, and services deficit shocks occur as
they did in the data for all countries other than Germany.
