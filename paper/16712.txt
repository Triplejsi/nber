What Does Futures Market Interest Tell Us about the Macroeconomy and Asset Prices?

ABSTRACT
Economists have traditionally viewed futures prices as fully informative about future economic activity
and asset prices. We argue that open interest could be more informative than futures prices in the presence
of hedging demand and limited risk absorption capacity in futures markets. We find that movements
in open interest are highly pro-cyclical, correlated with both macroeconomic activity and movements
in asset prices. Movements in commodity market interest predict commodity returns, bond returns,
and movements in the short rate even after controlling for other known predictors. To a lesser degree,
movements in open interest predict returns in currency, bond, and stock markets.

Introduction

Economists have traditionally viewed futures prices as fully informative about future economic activity and asset prices and have remained silent on the role of open interest, or the
amount of futures contracts outstanding (Samuelson, 1965; Grossman, 1977). The theory of
backwardation implies that the risk premium depends only on the net supply-demand imbalance among hedgers in the futures market, not on the gross amount of futures contracts
outstanding (Keynes, 1923; Hicks, 1939). The range of empirical work that uses futures
market data reﬂects these traditional theories. Macroeconomists use commodity futures and
spot prices to forecast inﬂation. International economists use the forward discount, or the
ratio of futures to spot price in the currency market, to forecast movements in exchange
rates. Financial economists use the yield spread to forecast bond and stock returns.
In this paper, we show that open interest contains information about future economic
activity and asset prices that is not fully revealed by futures prices or net supply-demand
imbalances among hedgers in futures markets. Our point of departure from these traditional theories is the observation that gross (as opposed to net) hedging demand, by either
producers or consumers of commodities, tends to be pro-cyclical. For example, oil producers that anticipate higher demand could go short oil futures, while utilities that anticipate
higher demand from manufacturing ﬁrms could go long oil futures. Importers that anticipate
higher US demand could go short currency futures, while exporters that anticipate higher
US demand could go long currency futures. Financial ﬁrms and insurance companies that
anticipate expansion of their balance sheets could enter bond and stock market futures to
hedge interest rate and equity risk. In all of these examples, anticipation of higher economic
activity leads to higher hedging demand, which drives up open interest.
In a simple model, we show that open interest is a more reliable signal of higher economic
activity and, consequently, future movements in asset prices than futures prices. The key
assumption is limited risk absorption capacity in the futures market. If there is excess
hedging demand from producers that want to be short futures, the futures price will fall
2

due to limited arbitrage by speculators. Conversely, if there is excess hedging demand from
consumers that want to be long futures, the futures price will rise due to limited arbitrage
by speculators. Because the futures price can either fall or rise in response to anticipation of
higher economic activity, the futures price is a less reliable signal of future economic activity
and asset prices than open interest.
We show a number of new facts that are consistent with this view of futures markets.
First, movements in open interest are highly correlated with movements in both futures and
spot prices in commodity, currency, bond, and stock markets. In each of these markets,
movements in open interest are positively correlated with the Chicago Fed National Activity
Index, which is a weighted average of 85 monthly indicators of US economic activity. Periods
of high US economic activity tend to coincide with high commodity returns, appreciation of
foreign currencies relative to the US dollar, low bond returns, and high stock returns. The
fact that movements in open interest are pro-cyclical is surprising because open interest does
not necessarily signal the direction of hedging demand.
Second, movements in open interest predict returns. Our main evidence is from the commodity market, which is relatively ideal for testing our hypothesis because hedging demand
and limited risk absorption capacity tend to be more important in this market. Moreover,
our sample for the commodity market starts in 1966, which is much earlier than 1984 for
the other markets. We ﬁnd that a standard deviation increase in commodity market interest increases expected commodity returns by 0.73% per month, which is both economically
large and statistically signiﬁcant. Commodity market interest remains a powerful predictor
even after controlling for a number of other predictors including the short rate, the yield
spread, the Chicago Fed National Activity Index, commodity basis (i.e., the ratio of futures
to spot price in the commodity market), commodity market imbalance (i.e., excess hedging
demand from hedgers), and past commodity returns. Interestingly, a high yield spread or
a high Chicago Fed National Activity Index predicts low commodity returns, implying that
expected commodity returns are pro-cyclical.

3

We ﬁnd qualitatively similar, but statistically weaker, evidence for predictability of returns in currency, bond, and stock markets. We ﬁnd that rising currency market interest,
which signals higher US economic activity and rising inﬂation expectations, predicts appreciation of a portfolio of foreign currencies relative to the US dollar. Notably, currency market
interest has more forecasting power than the forward discount, which is a leading predictor of
exchange rates in international ﬁnance. Similarly, rising bond market interest, which signals
higher economic activity and rising inﬂation expectations, predicts low bond returns. Finally,
rising stock market interest predicts high stock returns, although the statistical evidence is
the weakest for this market.
Third, we ﬁnd that rising commodity market interest predicts low bond returns and a
rising short rate. A standard deviation increase in commodity market interest decreases
expected bond returns by 0.32% per month, which is highly statistically signiﬁcant. This
ﬁnding supports our hypothesis that commodity market interest reﬂects hedging in response
to news about higher economic activity. Anticipation of higher economic activity, which is
bad news for the bond market, predicts low bond returns and rising inﬂation expectations.
Our preferred interpretation of the evidence is that open interest contains information
about future economic activity and inﬂation expectations that is not immediately impounded
in asset prices. An alternative interpretation, that open interest captures time-varying risk
premium, is less likely because the relation between movements in open interest and asset
prices implies momentum instead of mean reversion. That is, movements in open interest are
positively correlated with both contemporaneous and future returns, which imply momentum
generated by underreaction to news captured by open interest.
The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents a model in which cyclical variation in open interest predicts returns. Section 3 describes the futures market data
and the construction of the key variables for empirical analysis. Section 4 presents evidence
that movements in open interest are highly pro-cyclical, correlated with both macroeconomic activity and movements in asset prices. Section 5 presents evidence that movements

4

in open interest predict returns even after controlling for other known predictors. Section 6
concludes.

2.

A model in which open interest predicts returns

We develop a simple model of the futures market that explains why open interest can be
a better predictor of returns than futures prices or the direction of hedging demand. For
expositional purposes, the underlying asset in our model is a commodity. The economics of
the model would be the same if the underlying asset were a currency, a bond, or a stock as
long as gross hedging demand rises with economic activity.
Our model is based on two plausible assumptions. First, information diﬀuses gradually in
ﬁnancial markets, which causes asset prices to initially underreact to news. This assumption
has been used successfully in a variety of contexts including macroeconomics (Mankiw and
Reis, 2002), international ﬁnance (Gourinchas and Tornell, 2004), and ﬁnancial economics
(Hong and Stein, 1999). Hong and Stein (2007) survey a large literature that presents
evidence for the underreaction of asset prices to news. Second, supply shocks move asset
prices due to ﬁnancial market frictions that limit arbitrage (De Long, Shleifer, Summers, and
Waldmann, 1990). Compelling evidence for downward-sloping demand exists in a variety of
ﬁnancial markets, even highly liquid ones such as bond and stock markets (see Shleifer, 1986,
for early evidence on stocks).

2.1.

Economic environment

There are three periods, indexed as t = 0, 1, 2. The riskless interest rate is constant and
normalized to zero. There is a spot market for a commodity in period 2, and there is a
futures contract on the same commodity that is traded in periods 0 and 1. Let S2 denote
the spot price for the commodity in period 2, which we assume is exogenous and stochastic.
In period 1, the economy can be in one of two states, “high” or “low”. In the high state,

5



the spot price in period 2 is distributed as S2 ∼ N S H , σ 2 . In the low state, the spot


price in period 2 is distributed as S2 ∼ N S L , σ 2 . There is relatively high demand for
the commodity in the high state so that S H > S L .1 In period 0, the probability that the
economy is in the high state in period 1 is π = 0.5. Note that
E0 [S2 ] = πS H + (1 − π)S L = S̄

(1)

Var0 (S2 ) = σ 2 + πS H2 + (1 − π)S L2 − S̄ 2 .

(2)

and

In period 1, there are producers that commit to production of the commodity for delivery
in period 2. Alternatively, there are producers that commit to use the commodity as an input
for production in period 2. The producers know the state of the economy in period 1 (i.e.,
whether it is high or low), but they still face uncertainty about the spot price (captured by
σ 2 ). Let Y H denote the quantity of the commodity that the producers commit to selling (or
buying) in the high state. Let Y L denote the quantity of the commodity that the producers
commit to selling (or buying) in the low state. In each state, Y > 0 if the commodity is
an output, and Y < 0 if the commodity is an input for the producers. We make a natural
assumption that there is relatively more demand for the commodity in the high state so that
 H   L
Y  > Y . We normalize Y L = 0 to simplify notation.
The producers are inﬁnitely risk-averse and would like to hedge all uncertainty about the
spot price. They can do so by entering the futures market in period 1. Let Ft denote the
futures price in period t on a contract that matures in period 2. The producers choose the
optimal futures position D1P to minimize the variance of their total proﬁt from production
1

To tailor our model to bond markets, we must reverse this inequality because high economic activity is
bad news for bonds. All the derivations in this subsection then follow through, resulting in a key prediction
that a high growth rate of open interest signals a low expected bond return.

and hedging activity:

min Var1 S2 Y + (S2 − F1 )D1P .
D1P

(3)

The producers can perfectly hedge all uncertainty by choosing D1P = −Y . The producers
are short futures if the commodity is an output, and they are long futures if the commodity
is an input. The producers are active in the futures market only in the high state because
D1P = −Y L = 0 in the low state. Otherwise, the producers do not participate in the futures
market.
In addition to the producers, two other groups of investors are in the futures market.
The ﬁrst group consists of informed one-period investors, who have mass λ ∈ (0, 1) in the
population of investors. They have the usual mean-variance objective function with riskaversion parameter γ. These investors are informed in the sense that they are fully aware
of the probability distribution for S2 in each period. In particular, they know the state of
the economy in period 1. The informed investors choose the optimal futures position DtI in
periods t = 0, 1 to maximize their objective function. The optimal futures position is given
by the usual mean-variance demand function:
DtI =

Et [Ft+1 − Ft ]
.
γVart (Ft+1 − Ft )

(4)

The second group consists of uninformed one-period investors, who have mass 1−λ in the
population of investors. They also have a mean-variance objective function with risk-aversion
parameter γ. The key modeling assumption is that these uninformed investors underreact
to news about the state of the economy. Speciﬁcally, they are unaware of the state of the
economy in period 1, so their subjective distribution of S2 in period 1 is the same as their
prior about S2 in period 0. The uninformed investors choose the optimal futures position
DtU in periods t = 0, 1 to maximize their objective function. The optimal futures position is

DtU =

Equilibrium futures prices

We now solve for the equilibrium futures price in period 1. The market-clearing condition
in period 1 is
λD1I + (1 − λ)D1U + D1P = 0.

The futures price in the low state is
F1L = ω1 S L + (1 − ω1 )S̄.

(9)

We now work backward to solve for the equilibrium futures price in period 0. The
market-clearing condition in period 0 is
λD0I + (1 − λ)D0U = 0.

(13)

We now make two key observations about the model. The ﬁrst observation is that the
futures price in the high state is lower than that in the low state if hedging demand is
suﬃciently high. More formally, F1H < F1L if
YH


λ SH − SL

γσ 2

(14)

The intuition for this result is straightforward. In the high state, good news about the
economy leads to a high futures price in the absence of hedging by the producers. In the
presence of hedging demand, however, the producers put downward pressure on the futures
price when Y H > 0. Because investors have limited risk-bearing capacity (captured by γσ 2 ),
hedging demand can more than oﬀset the impact of good news, leading to a low futures
price.
The second observation is that open interest in the high state is always higher than
that in the low state because of hedging by the producers. In the high state, the informed
investors are the only ones to be long futures if Y H > 0, while both the informed investors

9

and the producers are long futures if Y H < 0. Therefore, open interest in the high state is

Note that O1H > O1L because S H − S̄ = S̄ − S L (implied by π = 0.5). Importantly, this is
true regardless of the direction of hedging demand (i.e., whether Y H > 0 or Y H < 0).
Deﬁne the return on futures between periods 0 and 1 as R1 = F1 − F0 . Similarly, deﬁne
the return on futures between periods 1 and 2 as R2 = S2 − F1 . The expected return on
futures between periods 1 and 2 is

We assume that the parameters of the model satisfy the restriction



(18)

which guarantees that the expected return in the high state is higher than that in the low
state. This restriction essentially rules out the extreme case in which hedging demand is so
negative and large as to completely undo the underreaction of the futures price to news in
period 1. We are now ready to state our main result.


Proposition 1. If Y H < λ S H − S L /(γσ 2 ), a high return R1 signals a high expected return
E1 [R2 ]. Otherwise, a high return signals a low expected return. A high growth rate of open
10

interest O1 /O0 always signals a high expected return E1 [R2 ], regardless of the direction of
hedging demand (i.e., whether Y H > 0 or Y H < 0).
When hedging demand is suﬃciently low or negative, a high return signals good news
about the economy. Therefore, we would observe positive serial correlation in returns due
to underreaction by the uninformed investors. When hedging demand is suﬃciently high,
however, a high return does not signal good news about the economy. Consequently, past
returns are not a reliable predictor of future returns because the sign of the serial correlation
depends on the importance of hedging demand. In contrast, a high growth rate of open
interest unambiguously signals good news about the economy and, therefore, a high expected
return.
The mechanism that generates predictability of returns in our model is distinct from
that in the theory of backwardation. In the theory of backwardation, predictability arises
from variation in the risk premium that speculators earn due to excess hedging demand
in the futures market. Hence, this theory implies that the direction of hedging demand
predicts returns. In our model, predictability arises from the underreaction of asset prices
to news. Our model implies that movements in open interest predict returns, regardless of
the direction of hedging demand.

Futures market data and variable definitions
Futures market data

Our data on futures and spot prices in commodity, currency, bond, and stock markets are
from the Commodity Research Bureau. This database conveniently contains a comprehensive
record of daily futures and spot prices for individual futures contracts since December 1964.2
2

This database contains only futures contracts that have survived until the present or that traded for an
extended period in the past. Various futures contracts fail to survive because of the lack of investor interest,
and they are subsequently not recorded in the database. Due to potential survivorship bias, one must be
careful in interpreting the unconditional average return, which is not the focus of this paper.

11

We also use data on open interest, or the quantity of futures contracts outstanding, as
well as the long and short positions of commercial traders (i.e., hedgers) for each futures
contract. Since January 1986, the data are available electronically from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Prior to that date, we hand-collected data from various volumes
of the Commitments of Traders in Commodity Futures. Data for December 1964 through
June 1972 are from the Commodity Exchange Authority (1964–1972). Data for July 1972
through December 1985 are from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (1972–1985).
During an 11-month period from January through November 1982, the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission did not collect data due to budgetary reasons. Our analysis uses all
available data and excludes the part of the sample aﬀected by the 11-month gap.
3.1.1.

Commodity market

We work with the broadest set of commodities for which both futures and spot prices are
available. Table 1 lists the 30 commodities that are part of our analysis, together with
the exchange in which they are traded and the date of the ﬁrst recorded observation.3 We
categorize the universe of commodities into four broad sectors. Agriculture consists of 14
commodities and tends to contain the oldest futures contracts. Energy consists of ﬁve commodities, among which heating oil is the oldest, available since November 1978. Crude oil is
available only since March 1983. Livestock consists of ﬁve commodities, among which live
cattle and pork bellies are available since December 1964. Metals consists of six commodities,
among which copper and silver are available since December 1964.
Figure 1 shows the share of total dollar open interest that each sector represents. The
ﬁgure shows that agriculture is the largest sector in the early part of the sample, while
energy becomes the largest sector later in the sample. The relative size of the four sectors is much more balanced later in the sample. These stylized facts have two important
3
A potential concern with this broad set of commodities is that not all futures contracts are equally liquid.
In analysis that is not reported here, we conﬁrm our main ﬁndings on a subset of 17 relatively liquid futures
contracts that are in the Dow Jones-AIG Commodities Index.

12

implications for our empirical analysis. First, we construct the commodity portfolio as an
equally weighted portfolio of the four sectors, which ensures that the portfolio composition
is consistent throughout the sample. Second, we have conﬁrmed that our main ﬁndings are
robust to splitting the sample into two halves in Hong and Yogo (2011).
3.1.2.

Currency, bond, and stock markets

Our sample for currency, bond, and stock markets starts in December 1982 because the
Commitments of Traders in Commodity Futures were not available between January and
November 1982, and these futures markets were relatively small prior to that date. Table 2
lists the eight currency, 10 bond, and 14 stock futures that are part of our analysis, together
with the exchange in which they are traded and the date of the ﬁrst recorded observation.
The core set of currency futures for which we have data since December 1982 are the
British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Deutsche mark, the Japanese yen, and the Swiss
franc. The Australian dollar is available since January 1987; the New Zealand dollar since
May 1997; and the euro since May 1998. Unlike the commodity market, trading in the
currency market takes place predominantly in over-the-counter forward and swap markets.
A potential concern arises in measuring currency market activity because open interest in the
futures market is a small share of overall activity that includes the over-the-counter market.
Unfortunately, data on open interest in the over-the-counter market are not available at the
frequency or sample length necessary for our analysis. Despite this problem, the growth rate
of open interest in the futures market should be a good proxy for the overall growth rate
of the currency market as long as the futures and forward markets move (more or less) in
proportion to one another. Insofar as open interest in the futures market is a noisy proxy for
hedging and speculative activity in the currency market, this measurement problem would
weaken the power of our statistical tests.
The universe of bond futures contains various ﬁxed-income instruments that vary in
maturity from 30-day federal funds to the 30-year Treasury bond. The oldest bond futures,

13

available since December 1982, are those for the three-month Eurodollar, the three-month
Treasury bill, the 10-year Treasury note, and the 30-year Treasury bond.
The universe of stock futures contains all major indices including the Dow Jones Industrial
Index, the Major Market Index, the Nasdaq 100 Index, the NYSE Composite Index, the
Russell 2000 Index, the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 400 and 500 indices, and the Value-Line
Arithmetic Index. The oldest stock futures, available since December 1982, are those for the
NYSE Composite Index and the S&P 500 Index.

3.2.

Definition of returns

We use returns on commodity futures to measure movements in commodity prices and returns
on currency futures to measure movements in exchanges rates. We prefer commodity futures
prices over spot prices for two reasons. First, commodity futures data are arguably higher
quality with fewer missing observations because they are actual transaction prices. Second,
the rate of return on commodity futures has a straightforward economic interpretation as
an actual return on an investment strategy. That being said, we have conﬁrmed our main
ﬁndings using commodity and currency spot prices in Hong and Yogo (2011).
3.2.1.

Commodity market

To construct the return on a portfolio of commodity futures, we ﬁrst compute the return on
a fully collateralized position for each futures contract as follows. Let Fi,t,T be the futures
price for commodity i at the end of month t, for a futures contract that matures at the
end of month T . Let Rf,t be the monthly gross return on the one-month T-bill in month
t, which is assumed to be the interest earned on collateral. The monthly gross return on a
fully collateralized long position in futures contract i with maturity T − t is
Ri,t,T =

Fi,t,T Rf,t
.
Fi,t−1,T

14

(19)

That is, an investor can take a long position in month t − 1 by posting Fi,t−1,T /Rf,t dollars
of collateral, then close out the position at Fi,t,T in month t.
For each commodity, we compute its monthly gross return as an equally weighted average of returns across commodity futures with greater than one and less than 13 months to
maturity. We exclude futures contracts with one month or less to maturity, which are typically illiquid because futures traders do not want to take physical delivery of the underlying.
Similarly, we exclude futures contracts with 13 months or greater to maturity because these
contracts are typically less liquid. For each sector, we construct an equally weighted portfolio
of all commodities in that sector. Finally, we construct an aggregate commodity portfolio
as an equally weighted portfolio of the four sectors. The advantage of equally weighting the
sectors is that no sector dominates even as the number of commodities within each sector
varies over time.
3.2.2.

Currency, bond, and stock markets

We deﬁne a long position on currency futures from the perspective of a US investor that
buys foreign currencies. Therefore, a high currency return refers to appreciation of foreign
currencies relative to the US dollar. Our construction of the return on a portfolio of currency
futures is analogous to our construction of the commodity-sector portfolios. We ﬁrst compute
the return on a fully collateralized position for each futures contract. For each currency, we
compute its monthly gross return as an equally weighted average of returns across currency
futures with greater than one and less than 13 months to maturity. Finally, we construct an
aggregate currency portfolio as an equally weighted portfolio of all currencies.
For bond and stock markets, we simply use the usual benchmarks for returns, instead of
computing these returns based on futures contracts. Bond returns are based on the 10-year
US Treasury note. Stock returns are based on the Center for Research in Security Prices
(CRSP) value-weighted portfolio of NYSE, Amex, and Nasdaq stocks.

3.3.

Definition of the predictor variables

3.3.1.

Commodity market

Our new predictor of commodity returns is the growth rate of commodity market interest.
We examine the growth rate (instead of the level) of open interest because a stochastic trend
exists in the data, which we left out of the model in Section 2 for simplicity. To construct
this variable, we ﬁrst compute the dollar open interest for each commodity as the spot price
times the quantity of futures contracts outstanding. We then aggregate dollar open interest
within each of the four sectors and compute its monthly growth rate. Finally, we compute
the aggregate growth rate of open interest as an equally weighted average of the growth rate
for each of the four sectors.4 Because the monthly growth rate of open interest is noisy, we
smooth it by taking a 12-month geometric average in the time series. We also construct a
12-month geometric average of commodity returns, which we use to test for momentum in
the time series of commodity returns.5
To test the incremental forecasting power of commodity market interest, we examine a
number of other variables that are known to predict commodity returns. These other predictor variables can be grouped into two categories. The ﬁrst category consists of aggregate
market predictors, which are motivated by theories such as the intertemporal capital asset
pricing model that view the commodity market as being fully integrated (Merton, 1973).
We focus on the short rate and the yield spread, which are known to predict the common
variation in commodity, bond, and stock returns (Fama and Schwert, 1977; Campbell, 1987;
Fama and French, 1989; Bessembinder and Chan, 1992).6 The short rate is the monthly

We have tried an alternative construction that does not involve the spot price. We ﬁrst compute the
growth rate of open interest (i.e., the quantity of futures contracts outstanding) for each commodity. We
then compute the median of the growth rate of open interest across all commodities within each sector.
Finally, we compute the aggregate growth rate of open interest as an equally weighted average of the growth
rate for each of the four sectors. This alternative construction leads to a time series that is very similar to
our preferred construction.
5
In Hong and Yogo (2011), we also examine the growth rate of trading volume, constructed in an analogous
way to the growth rate of open interest, and ﬁnd that it does not aﬀect the forecasting power of open interest
in the subsample since 2002.

In analysis that is not reported here, we also examine the default spread (i.e., the diﬀerence between
Moody’s Baa and Aaa corporate bond yields) and measures of aggregate stock market volatility (i.e., both

16

average yield on the one-month T-bill. The yield spread is the diﬀerence between Moody’s
Aaa corporate bond yield and the short rate. In addition to these ﬁnancial variables, we
examine the Chicago Fed National Activity Index as a measure of real economic activity,
which is known to predict inﬂation (Stock and Watson, 1999).
The second category consists of commodity-speciﬁc predictors, which are motivated by
the view that the commodity market is segmented from other markets. In particular, we
examine two measures of supply-demand imbalances in the commodity futures market, motivated by the theory of backwardation. The ﬁrst measure is an aggregate version of basis,
which is known to predict returns on commodity futures (Fama and French, 1987). To construct commodity basis, we ﬁrst compute basis for each commodity i with maturity T − t
as

Basisi,t,T =

Fi,t,T
Si,t

1/(T −t)
− 1.7

(20)

We then compute the median of basis across contracts for each commodity and then the
median of basis across commodities for each sector. We use the median, instead of the
mean, because it is less sensitive to outliers in basis for individual futures contracts. Finally,
we compute commodity basis as an equally weighted average of basis across the four sectors.
The second measure is an aggregate version of a more direct measure of supply-demand
imbalances in the commodity futures market that is found in the literature (Carter, Rausser,
and Schmitz, 1983; Chang, 1985; Bessembinder, 1992).8 We ﬁrst compute futures market
imbalance for each sector as the ratio of two variables. The numerator is the dollar value
of short minus long positions held by commercial traders in the Commitments of Traders
realized and implied volatility). Although these variables predict returns individually, they have weak incremental forecasting power once we control for the short rate and the yield spread.
7
While the Commodity Research Bureau has a reliable record of spot prices, a spot price is not always
available on the same trading day as a recorded futures price. Whenever the spot price is missing, we ﬁrst
look for an expiring futures contract to impute the spot price. If an expiring futures contract is not available,
we then look for the last available spot price within 30 days.

More recently, Acharya, Lochstoer, and Ramadorai (2010) ﬁnd that the default risk of energy producers,
which is an alternative measure of hedging demand, predicts returns on energy futures.

in Commodity Futures, summed across all commodities in that sector. The denominator is
the dollar value of short plus long positions held by commercial traders, summed across all
commodities in that sector. We then compute commodity market imbalance as an equally
weighted average of futures market imbalance across the four sectors.

Currency, bond, and stock markets

For aggregate market predictors of currency, bond, and stock returns, we examine the short
rate, the yield spread, and the Chicago Fed National Activity Index. For currency-speciﬁc
predictors, we examine currency market interest, currency returns, currency basis, and currency market imbalance. For bond-speciﬁc predictors, we examine bond market interest,
bond returns, and bond market imbalance. For stock-speciﬁc predictors, we examine stock
market interest, stock returns, stock market imbalance, and the dividend yield on the CRSP
value-weighted stock portfolio. The construction of these variables for currency, bond, and
stock markets are analogous to our construction of the same variables for the commodity
market.

Summary statistics for returns and open interest

4.1.

Summary statistics for returns

In Panel A of Table 3, we report summary statistics for monthly excess returns over the
one-month T-bill rate in the 1965–2008 sample period. The set of assets for which we have
observations on returns in this sample period are the commodity portfolio, the 10-year US
Treasury note, and the CRSP value-weighted stock portfolio. The returns on the currency
portfolio are available only since 1983.
Commodities have an average excess return of 0.64% and a standard deviation of 4.62%.
This corresponds to an annualized average excess return of 7.68% and an annualized standard deviation of 16.00%. For the same sample period, bonds have an annualized average
18

excess return of 2.04% and an annualized standard deviation of 8.00%, and stocks have an
annualized average excess return of 4.32% and an annualized standard deviation of 15.66%.
Thus, commodities had a higher realized Sharpe ratio than bonds or stocks (Gorton and
Rouwenhorst, 2006). The ﬁrst-order autocorrelation of monthly excess commodity returns
is 0.07, which is virtually identical to that for bond and stock returns. The correlation
between commodity and bond returns is −0.11, which makes sense in light of the inverse
relation between bond prices and inﬂation. The correlation between commodity and stock
returns is 0.06.
Panel B of Table 3 reports the same statistics in the 1983–2008 subsample, during which
we also have observations on currency returns. Commodities have an annualized average
excess return of 4.68% and an annualized standard deviation of 10.88%. For the same sample
period, currencies have an annualized average excess return of 1.68% and an annualized
standard deviation of 7.86%. Bonds have an annualized average excess return of 3.96% and an
annualized standard deviation of 7.62%, and stocks have an annualized average excess return
of 5.76% and an annualized standard deviation of 15.35%. The ﬁrst-order autocorrelation
for monthly excess returns is close to 0.1 for all four markets. All four returns are positively
correlated with each other, except for the correlation of −0.17 between commodity and bond
returns. The correlation of 0.29 between commodity and currency returns is the strongest
among the four markets.

4.2.

Summary statistics for the predictor variables

4.2.1.

Commodity market

Table 4 reports summary statistics for the predictors of commodity returns in the 1965–
2008 sample period. The 12-month growth rate of commodity market interest has a mean of
1.47% per month and a standard deviation of 2.06%. The 12-month commodity returns have
a mean of 1.08% per month and a standard deviation of 1.30%. All the predictor variables
are persistent with a monthly autocorrelation of at least 0.90, except for commodity basis,
19

which has a relatively low autocorrelation of 0.79.
The yield spread is negatively correlated with the Chicago Fed National Activity Index,
which conﬁrms the known fact that the yield spread is countercyclical. Commodity market
interest is positively correlated with commodity returns, and both variables are positively
correlated with the Chicago Fed National Activity Index. Commodity market interest is
essentially uncorrelated with commodity basis. However, commodity market interest has
a correlation of 0.31 with commodity market imbalance. This means that unusually high
commodity market interest tends to coincide with hedgers taking unusually strong short
positions in commodity futures.
Figure 2 highlights the cyclicality of commodity market interest, by showing its time
series together with the Chicago Fed National Activity Index. During the recent commodity
boom, commodity market interest grew over a ﬁve-year period from $62 billion in June 2003
to $492 billion in June 2008. Only the energy crisis of the 1970s witnessed higher activity.
During these two historic periods and also more generally, a high degree of correlation exists
between movements in commodity market interest and the Chicago Fed National Activity
Index.
4.2.2.

Currency, bond, and stock markets

Panel A of Table 5 reports summary statistics for the predictors of currency returns in the
1983–2008 sample period. The correlations between the predictors of currency returns are
qualitatively similar to those between the predictors of commodity returns in Table 4. In
particular, currency market interest is positively correlated with currency returns, and both
variables are positively correlated with the Chicago Fed National Activity Index. In other
words, periods of high economic activity are associated with rising currency market interest
and high currency returns.
Panel B of Table 5 reports summary statistics for the predictors of bond returns. Bond
market interest is positively correlated with the Chicago Fed National Activity Index, and

20

bond returns are negatively correlated with the Chicago Fed National Activity Index. That
is, periods of high economic activity are associated with rising bond market interest and low
bond returns. This inverse relation between economic activity and bond returns makes sense
in light of the fact that high economic activity leads to rising inﬂation expectations, which
is bad news for the bond market.
Panel C of Table 5 reports summary statistics for the predictors of stock returns. The
correlations between the predictors of stock returns are qualitatively similar to those between
the predictors of commodity returns. In particular, stock market interest is positively correlated with stock returns, and both variables are positively correlated with the Chicago Fed
National Activity Index. In other words, periods of high economic activity are associated
with rising stock market interest and high stock returns.
Figure 2 highlights the cyclicality of currency, bond, and stock market interest, by showing their time series together with the Chicago Fed National Activity Index. In each of these
three markets, strong correlation exists between movements in open interest and the Chicago
Fed National Activity Index. Given that movements in open interest are highly pro-cyclical,
it is a prime candidate for a predictor of returns. In the next section, we examine whether
movements in open interest predict returns even after controlling for other cyclical variables.

5.1.

Predictability of returns by open interest
Commodity market

Figure 3 shows the time series of the 12-month growth rate of commodity market interest
and 12-month commodity returns. This ﬁgure conﬁrms that these two time series are highly
correlated. More interesting, this ﬁgure reveals that commodity returns look like a version of
movements in commodity market interest that is shifted forward by a few months. That is,
movements in commodity market interest lead movements in commodity prices in the same
direction.
21

In Table 6, we formally test the hypothesis that movements in commodity market interest predict commodity returns. In Column 1, we ﬁrst estimate a baseline speciﬁcation in
which the predictor variables are the short rate, the yield spread, and commodity basis. All
coeﬃcients are standardized so that they can be interpreted as the percentage point change
in monthly expected returns per 1 standard deviation change in the predictor variable. The
short rate enters with a coeﬃcient of −0.51 and a t-statistic of −2.42. More interesting,
the yield spread enters with a coeﬃcient of −0.51 and a t-statistic of −2.68. This negative coeﬃcient is in sharp contrast to the positive coeﬃcient found for bonds and stocks
(Campbell, 1987; Fama and French, 1989). Because expected commodity returns are low
(i.e., commodity prices are high) when the yield spread is high, commodities are a good
hedge for time-varying investment opportunities in bond and stock markets. Commodity
basis predicts commodity returns with a coeﬃcient of −0.57 and a t-statistic of −2.05. The
fact that low commodity basis (i.e., low futures relative to spot price) predicts high returns
on being long commodity futures is consistent with the theory of backwardation. Overall,
the R2 of the forecasting regression is 2.58%.
In Column 2 of Table 6, we introduce commodity market interest to examine its incremental forecasting power for commodity returns. Commodity market interest enters with a
coeﬃcient of 0.73 and a t-statistic of 2.50. This means that a standard deviation increase
in commodity market interest increases expected commodity returns by 0.73% per month.
The coeﬃcients for the other three predictor variables are virtually unchanged from Column
1 because commodity market interest is essentially uncorrelated with these other variables.
For this sample period, commodity market interest explains a larger share of the variation
in expected commodity returns than the other predictor variables. Moreover, the inclusion
of commodity market interest increases the R2 of the forecasting regression from 2.58% to
4.96%.
In Column 3 of Table 6, we introduce past commodity returns to the baseline speciﬁcation
and ﬁnd that they enter with a coeﬃcient of 0.32 and a t-statistic of 1.39. In Column 4,

22

we ﬁnd that commodity market interest drives out the forecasting power of past commodity
returns in a horse race between these two variables. Commodity market interest enters
with a coeﬃcient of 0.77 and a t-statistic of 1.85, while past commodity returns enter with a
statistically insigniﬁcant coeﬃcient of −0.08. This result shows that while commodity market
interest and commodity returns are highly correlated, they contain diﬀerent information
about future commodity returns. As shown in Figure 3, commodity market interest tends
to lead commodity returns and can, therefore, be more informative.
In Column 5 of Table 6, we introduce commodity market imbalance to the baseline
speciﬁcation and ﬁnd that it enters with a coeﬃcient of 0.34 and a t-statistic of 1.50. This
positive coeﬃcient is consistent with the theory of backwardation, which implies that high
hedging demand predicts high returns on being long futures. In Column 6, we ﬁnd that
commodity market interest drives out the forecasting power of commodity market imbalance
in a horse race between these two variables. Commodity market interest enters with a
coeﬃcient of 0.69 and a t-statistic of 2.42, while commodity market imbalance enters with a
statistically insigniﬁcant coeﬃcient of 0.12. As shown in Table 4, commodity market interest
and commodity market imbalance are positively correlated. Hence, a potential interpretation
of these results is that commodity market imbalance is just a noisy proxy for commodity
market interest.
In Column 7 of Table 6, we introduce the Chicago Fed National Activity Index to the
baseline speciﬁcation and ﬁnd that it enters with a coeﬃcient of 0.47 and a t-statistic of
2.09. This positive coeﬃcient is additional evidence that expected commodity returns are
pro-cyclical, which is the opposite of countercyclical expected returns found in bond and
stock markets. In Column 8, we ﬁnd that commodity market interest reduces the forecasting
power of the Chicago Fed National Activity Index in a horse race between these two variables.
Commodity market interest enters with a coeﬃcient of 0.68 and a t-statistic of 1.88, while
the Chicago Fed National Activity Index enters with a statistically insigniﬁcant coeﬃcient
of 0.30.

23

We summarize our main ﬁndings in Table 6 as follows. The fact that the short rate,
the yield spread, and the Chicago Fed National Activity Index predict commodity returns is
consistent with the integrated markets view. That is, the same aggregate factors that drive
other asset prices are partly responsible for movements in commodity prices. The fact that
commodity basis and commodity market imbalance predict movements in commodity prices
is consistent with the segmented markets view. That is, the theory of backwardation is partly
responsible for movements in commodity prices. More important, movements in commodity
market interest predict movements in commodity prices even after controlling for these other
predictors. This ﬁnding challenges us to develop a new view of the commodity market that is
unrelated to these traditional theories. Our preferred hypothesis is that commodity market
interest contains information about the future supply and demand for commodities, which
cannot be inferred by commodity prices alone.
In Panel A of Table 7, we show that commodity market interest predicts excess returns
on the 10-year US Treasury note over the one-month T-bill rate. In a baseline speciﬁcation
in Column 1, the short rate enters with a statistically insigniﬁcant coeﬃcient of 0.20. The
yield spread enters with a coeﬃcient of 0.49 and a t-statistic of 3.41. In Column 2, we introduce commodity market interest to the baseline speciﬁcation and ﬁnd that it enters with a
coeﬃcient of −0.32 and a t-statistic of −3.11. This means that a standard deviation increase
in commodity market interest decreases expected bond returns by 0.32% per month. The
forecasting power of commodity market interest is comparable to that of the yield spread,
which is known to be a reliable predictor of bond returns. Column 3 shows that commodity returns predict bond returns, but Column 4 shows that they do not have forecasting
power beyond commodity market interest. Similarly, Column 5 shows that the Chicago Fed
National Activity Index predicts bond returns, but Column 6 shows that it does not have
forecasting power beyond commodity market interest.
In Panel B of Table 7, we show that commodity market interest also predicts movements
in the one-month T-bill rate. In a baseline speciﬁcation in Column 1, the yield spread enters

24

with a statistically insigniﬁcant coeﬃcient of 0.06. In Column 2, we introduce commodity
market interest to the baseline speciﬁcation and ﬁnd that it enters with a coeﬃcient of
0.12 and a t-statistic of 3.34. This means that a standard deviation increase in commodity
market interest increases the expected annualized short rate by 0.12%. Column 3 shows
that commodity returns predict movements in the short rate with a coeﬃcient of 0.12 and
a t-statistic of 3.47. In Column 4, commodity market interest and commodity returns enter
with similar coeﬃcients in a horse race between these two variables. Column 5 shows that
the Chicago Fed National Activity Index predicts movements in the short rate, which is
consistent with its ability to predict realized inﬂation (Stock and Watson, 1999). Column
6 shows that the Chicago Fed National Activity Index does not drive out the forecasting
power of commodity market interest.
We summarize our main ﬁndings in Table 7 as follows. From Campbell and Ammer
(1993), we know that movements in expected excess bond returns are oﬀset by movements
in expected inﬂation. Therefore, the fact that commodity market interest predicts excess
bond returns implies that it also captures movements in expected inﬂation at low frequency.
Similarly, movements in the short rate can be interpreted as movements in expected monthly
inﬂation under the Fisher hypothesis. Therefore, the fact that commodity market interest
predicts movements in the short rate implies that it also predicts movements in expected
inﬂation at higher frequency. Taken together, this evidence suggests that commodity market
interest contains information about inﬂation expectations that is not captured by conventional predictors of inﬂation such as commodity prices and the Chicago Fed National Activity
Index.

5.2.

Currency market

Subsection 5.1 shows that movements in commodity market interest predict movements in
commodity prices. This subsection shows an analogous relation between currency market interest and exchange rates. The economic rationale for why currency market interest predicts
25

movements in exchange rates is analogous to our hypothesis for the commodity market. A
strong US economy leads to inﬂation and consequently depreciation of the US dollar relative
to foreign currencies.9 Suppose importers expect higher future demand and, in response,
enter currency futures to hedge risk arising from higher anticipated imports. Insofar as this
good news about the US economy diﬀuses gradually in the currency market, rising currency
market interest predicts high returns on being long foreign currencies.
Table 8 tests whether movements in currency market interest predict currency returns. In
Column 1, we ﬁrst estimate a baseline speciﬁcation in which the predictor variables are the
short rate, the yield spread, and currency basis (i.e., the forward discount). The short rate
and the yield spread have little forecasting power for currency returns. However, currency
basis predicts currency returns with a coeﬃcient of −0.25 and a t-statistic of −1.48. By the
covered interest rate parity, currency basis is the diﬀerence in interest rates between the US
and foreign countries. Therefore, the negative coeﬃcient means that when the US interest
rate is low relative to the rest of the world, foreign currencies are expected to appreciate
relative to the US dollar. This failure of the uncovered interest rate parity is known as the
forward-discount puzzle in international ﬁnance.
In Column 2 of Table 8, we introduce currency market interest to examine its incremental
forecasting power for currency returns. Currency market interest enters with a coeﬃcient
of 0.37 and a t-statistic of 2.48. This means that a standard deviation increase in currency
market interest increases expected currency returns by 0.37% per month. Figure 3 is a
visual representation of this ﬁnding. Throughout the sample period, movements in currency
market interest tend to lead movements in currency returns, except perhaps for a period in
the 1990s. The coeﬃcient for currency market interest is larger in economic magnitude than
that for currency basis. Moreover, the inclusion of currency market interest increases the
9

More formally, a positive US productivity shock leads to depreciation of the US dollar relative to foreign
currencies in a standard Ricardian model of bilateral trade (Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland, 1994). The
intuition for this result is that a positive US productivity shock makes goods produced by the US relatively
abundant, so that the price of these goods must fall relative to the price of goods produced by foreign
countries.

26

R2 of the forecasting regression from 2.03% to 4.55%. These ﬁndings suggest that currency
market interest is a more important determinant of exchange rates than currency basis.
In Column 3 of Table 8, we introduce past currency returns to the baseline speciﬁcation
and ﬁnd that they enter with a coeﬃcient of 0.26 and a t-statistic of 1.51. That is, some
evidence exists for momentum in the time series of currency returns, similar to one that
is found for commodity returns (Moskowitz, Ooi, and Pedersen, 2010). In Column 4, we
ﬁnd that currency market interest weakens the forecasting power of currency returns in a
horse race between these two variables. Currency market interest enters with a coeﬃcient of
0.32 and a t-statistic of 2.18, while currency returns enter with a statistically insigniﬁcant
coeﬃcient of 0.12.
In Column 5 of Table 8, we introduce currency market imbalance to the baseline speciﬁcation and ﬁnd that it enters with a coeﬃcient of 0.25 and a t-statistic of 1.98. This positive
coeﬃcient is consistent with the theory of backwardation, which implies that high hedging
demand predicts high returns on being long futures. In Column 6, we ﬁnd that currency
market interest drives out the forecasting power of currency market imbalance in a horse race
between these two variables. Currency market interest enters with a coeﬃcient of 0.33 and
a t-statistic of 2.25, while currency market imbalance enters with a statistically insigniﬁcant
coeﬃcient of 0.15.
In Column 7 of Table 8, we introduce the Chicago Fed National Activity Index to the
baseline speciﬁcation and ﬁnd that it enters with a coeﬃcient of 0.32 and a t-statistic of 1.41.
This positive coeﬃcient is consistent with the hypothesis that a strong US economy leads
to inﬂation and consequently depreciation of the US dollar relative to foreign currencies.
In Column 8, we ﬁnd that currency market interest drives out the forecasting power of the
Chicago Fed National Activity Index in a horse race between these two variables. Currency
market interest enters with a coeﬃcient of 0.32 and a t-statistic of 2.24, while the Chicago
Fed National Activity Index enters with a statistically insigniﬁcant coeﬃcient of 0.24.

27

5.3.

Bond market

Table 9 tests whether movements in bond market interest predict bond returns. In Column
1, we ﬁrst estimate a baseline speciﬁcation in which the predictor variables are the short
rate and the yield spread. The short rate enters with a statistically insigniﬁcant coeﬃcient
of 0.20. However, the yield spread is a powerful predictor of bond returns with a coeﬃcient
of 0.34 and a t-statistic of 2.39.
In Column 2 of Table 9, we introduce bond market interest and ﬁnd that it enters with
a coeﬃcient of −0.31 and a t-statistic of −1.91. This means that a standard deviation
increase in bond market interest decreases expected bond returns by 0.31% per month.
To interpret the sign of this coeﬃcient, recall from Table 5 that bond market interest is
positively correlated with the Chicago Fed National Activity Index. A high Chicago Fed
National Activity Index signals inﬂation, which is bad news for bonds.
In Columns 3 and 4 of Table 9, we ﬁnd that past bond returns do not have forecasting
power for future bond returns. Similarly, Columns 5 and 6 show that bond market imbalance
does not have forecasting power for bond returns. In Column 7, we introduce the Chicago Fed
National Activity Index to the baseline speciﬁcation and ﬁnd that it enters with a coeﬃcient
of −0.31 and a t-statistic of −1.96. In Column 8, we ﬁnd that the Chicago Fed National
Activity Index slightly weakens the forecasting power of bond market interest in a horse race
between these two variables. Given that bond market interest and the Chicago Fed National
Activity Index both signal inﬂation, these ﬁndings are consistent with our hypothesis.

5.4.

Stock market

Table 10 tests whether movements in stock market interest predict stock returns. Column
1 is our baseline speciﬁcation in which the predictor variables are the short rate, the yield
spread, and the dividend yield. None of these variables, which are known to predict stock
returns, is statistically signiﬁcant in the 1984–2008 sample period. This is perhaps not
surprising given that stock returns are notoriously diﬃcult to predict, especially in a short
28

sample period that includes the unusual stock market behavior of the late 1990s. Hence, the
results that follow for stock market interest should be interpreted with this caveat in mind.
In Column 2 of Table 10, we introduce stock market interest to our baseline speciﬁcation
and ﬁnd that it enters with a coeﬃcient of 0.38 and a t-statistic of 1.38. This means that
a standard deviation increase in stock market interest increases expected stock returns by
0.38% per month. Although this coeﬃcient is not statistically signiﬁcant in this sample
period, the economic magnitude of the coeﬃcient is comparable to that for the short rate,
the yield spread, and the dividend yield.
In Columns 3 and 4 of Table 10, we ﬁnd that past stock returns do not have forecasting
power for future stock returns. In Column 5, we introduce stock market imbalance to our
baseline speciﬁcation and ﬁnd that it enters with a coeﬃcient of −0.45 and a t-statistic of
−1.80. In Column 6, we ﬁnd that stock market interest enters with a coeﬃcient of 0.50 and
a t-statistic of 1.76 in a speciﬁcation that controls for stock market imbalance. In Column
7, we introduce the Chicago Fed National Activity Index to our baseline speciﬁcation and
ﬁnd that it enters with a coeﬃcient of 0.70 and a t-statistic of 1.97. In Column 8, we ﬁnd
that the Chicago Fed National Activity Index weakens the forecasting power of stock market
interest in a horse race between these two variables.

6.

Conclusion

Commodity market interest is a more powerful predictor of commodity returns, bond returns,
and movements in the short rate than past commodity prices or the Chicago Fed National
Activity Index. Our ﬁndings have broader implications for the large macro literature on
inﬂation forecasting. Macroeconomists have already known for some time that asset prices
can be useful for forecasting inﬂation and output (Stock and Watson, 2003). These forecasting models generally assume that asset prices contain timely information about economic
activity and inﬂation expectations. However, our ﬁndings suggest that asset prices initially

29

underreact to news about economic activity and inﬂation expectations, which are better
captured by open interest. Our work opens up a new approach to inﬂation forecasting, in
which commodity market interest could be used to improve the forecasting power of existing
models.
Our work also opens up a new approach to modeling expected returns in ﬁnancial economics. Most empirical models of expected returns are premised on the notion that past
prices contain all useful information for forecasting future returns, whether such predictability arises from a time-varying risk premium or limits to arbitrage. Our work shows that
transaction quantities, in particular open interest in the futures market, contain information
that is not fully revealed by transaction prices alone. The idea that transaction quantities could be more informative than transaction prices is entirely new and oﬀers a richer
understanding of movements in asset prices.

Table 2: Currency, bond, and stock market futures
The eight currency, 10 bond, and 14 stock futures used in our analysis, for which futures and spot prices are available through
the Commodity Research Bureau, are listed. The futures contracts are traded on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), the
Index and Option Market (IOM), the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the International Monetary Market (IMM), and the
Kansas City Board of Trade (KCBT). The sample starts in December 1982 because the Commitments of Traders in Commodity
Futures were not available between January and November 1982, and these futures markets were relatively small prior to that
date.

The mean, the standard deviation, the autocorrelation, and the pairwise correlation of monthly excess returns over the one-month
T-bill rate are reported. The portfolio of fully collateralized commodity futures is equally weighted across agriculture, energy,
livestock, and metals. The portfolio of fully collateralized currency futures is equally weighted across the eight currencies listed
in Table 2. The other assets are the 10-year US Treasury note and the Center for Research in Security Prices value-weighted
stock portfolio.

Table 4: Summary statistics for predictors of commodity returns
The mean, the standard deviation, the autocorrelation, and the pairwise correlation for predictors of commodity returns are
reported. The short rate is the monthly average yield on the one-month T-bill. The yield spread is the diﬀerence between
Moody’s Aaa corporate bond yield and the short rate. The Chicago Fed National Activity Index is a weighted average of 85
monthly indicators of US economic activity. The next predictor variables are the 12-month geometrically averaged growth rate
of commodity market interest and the 12-month geometrically averaged commodity returns. Commodity market imbalance is
the ratio of short minus long positions relative to short plus long positions held by commercial traders in the Commitments
of Traders in Commodity Futures. Commodity basis is equally weighted across agriculture, energy, livestock, and metals. The
sample period is 1965:12–2008:12.
