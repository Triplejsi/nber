ANNUI

PRICES AND SAVING BEHAVIOR IN THE UNITED STATES

Benjamin M. Friedman and Mark Warshawsky*

One of the most puzzling contrasts between observed behavior and
the implications of standard economic theory is the fact that, at least in

the United States, few elderly individuals purchase life annuities. The
conventional life—cycle model, based on the appealing concept that people
save so as to smooth their consumption over their lifetimes, suggests that
elderly retired individuals would seek to dissave out of their available

resources as their remaining life expectancy shortens. Instead, observed
age-wealth profiles among the elderly are more nearly flat.1 Given the
uncertainty associated with any individual's life expectancy, this
reluctance to dissave would be a natural consequence of risk aversion if

individuals could not avoid that risk by buying annuities. Since a
well-developed individual life annuity market does exist in the United
States, however, the challenge is to explain why so few people actually
avail themselves of it.2
In an earlier paper, the authors offered an explanation for this

phenomenon based on a combination of the cost of annuities and a bequest

motive.3 Annuities are costly, in the first instance, because the insurer
must price them to defray ordinary costs of doing business and then earn a

competitive profit. In addition, the typical individual in the population

finds annuities even more costly because of adverse selection — in other
words, the tendency of longer—lived people to buy more annuities than

people facing shorter life expectancies. Both kinds of costs understandably
discourage the purchase of individual life annuities, within the context

—2—

of the familiar life—cycle model. By contrast, if individuals choose not
to buy annuities because they have accumulated wealth to leave to their
heirs, rather than to finance their own consumption after retirement, then

the life-cycle model — and with it, a variety of well known implications
for economic behavior and economic policy — fails to withstand scrutiny.
The principal finding of the authors' earlier research was that during

the early years of retirement the observed cost of annuities can
independently account for the absence of purchases of individual life
annuities, while at older ages the combination of the observed costs of
annuities and a bequest motive of plausible magnitude can do so.
The

of

object of this paper is to experiment with an alternative form

the authors' earlier

the

analysis by representing the cost of annuities as

(positive) differential between the premium on an annuity and its

implicit expected value, rather than as the (negative) differential between
the implicit expected yield on an annnity and the available yield on
alternative forms of wealth holding. Given the inverse relationship between

price and yield for any fixed-income invesnent vehicle, in principle
these two forms of analysis are simply the duals of one another. The difference
here stems from the need

to compromise with reality in order to investigate

the implications of life annuities within the context of a readily
tractable model of the consumption—saving and portfolio—allocation decisions.
In effect, the analysis both here and in the authors' earlier paper

represents these annuities as if they were one—year contracts. Here,
however, the analysis represents the cost of annuities as a one—time

proportional charge to enter a market in which actuarially fair annuities are
available, while in the earlier paper this cost consists of a continual

unfairness in the pricing of the (one—year) annuity contracts. One

—3—

advantage of the approach taken here is that, because large short—sales of
annuities are no longer optimal, the nonnegativity constraint that

was necessary in the earlier paper is no longer required. Because these
formulations of the problem imply alternative opportunity sets, the
results given by the two

approaches

differ.

Section I presents raw data on the prices of individual life annuities

of these data that correspond to familiar concepts in economic discussions

I. Prices of Individual Life annuities
Table 1

presents

data for 1968—83, coni1ed from successive annual

issues of the A.M. Best Flitcraft Coutpend, on the per—dollar prices of
guaranteed single-premium immediate annuities offered in the United

States for 65—year—old males. In each case the value shown is the price
(premium) charged to purchase a stream of payments equalling $1 per nDnth,

to begin in the nth iediately following the purchase and continue for the
life of the annuitant.
The first column of Table 1 indicates the nan premium charged on

this basic annuity contract by the ten largest insurance coanies in the
United States. These data are probably the mrst relevant for analyzing
economy-wide individual behavior. The largest insurers usually do business

in all regions of the country, so that the typical 65 -year-old U.S. male

has access to annuities at this mean price with little or no search costs.
is would be expected, the average annuity premium has fallen over tim,

as the effect of rising interest rates has predeminated over the effect of
increasing life expectancy.
The remaining columns of Table 1 indicate the potential returns to
market search by showing the dispersion of premiums charged for this same

basic contract by different insurers .

The

second and third columns show

data for the highest and lowest premiums charged for this contract by any

of the ten largest insurers. Presumably most 65—year—old males have access
to the 1est premium in this groi at only ndest search cost. The final
column of the table shows the lowest premium charged for this contract by any

of the fifty—odd insurers in BestLs saxL1e. Because the smaller couanies

in the sanle do not necessarily maintain sales forces in all parts of the
country, however, there is no presuntion that the typical 65—year-old male

Table 2 presents calculations of the present expected value of an
immediate $1 monthly annuity for the life of a 65-year-old male. The two

key ingredients in such calculations, of course, are the assumed interest

rate and the assumed structure of mortality probabilities.5 The table
reports annual calculations of present expected value based on two different
interest rates, the 20—year U.S. Government bond yield and the average

yield on corporate debt directly placed with major life insurance conanies.
In the calculations underlying the first two columns of the table, the
assumed mortality probabilities are the general population mortality
probabilities for 65-year-old males reported in the 1970 and 1980 U.S.

Life Tables, adjusted by a factor of • 985 to reflect the 1.5% annual
irovement in U.S. male mortality probabilities that has occurred over

the last two decades, and by a further factor of .9925 to reflect the

asstion of a future 0.75% annual irovement in male mortality probabilities
for

all ages. 6
Which of the two interest rates used in Table 2 is most relevant

depends on the perspective taken in the analysis. From the standpoint of
the actuarial "fair" value to an insurer who has access to (and

typically owns), direct placement securities, the associated hier yield is
the correct one to choose. Alternatively, from the standpoint of an
individual's opportunity cost of funds, the lower yield on U.S. Government
bonds is relevant if

the individual has no better investment vehicle.

Because direct placements bear higher yields than do Government bonds, the
present

expected values calculated using this yield are smaller than the

corresponding values calculated using the Government bond yield. Nevertheless,

the present expected values calculated on either basis, including the

charged in the same year by any insurer in Best"s sample.

If all individuals had identical mortality probabilities, a
comparison between the calculated present expected values shown

in

the

first two columns of Table 2 and the actual premiums shown in Table 1

would indicate the "load factor" by which the pricing of these annuities

differs from their fair actuarial value. In fact, many individuals have
information that leads them to expect either a shorter or a longer life
than the population-wide average. Insurers, however, typically charge a
uniform premium to all individuals of the same age and sex, presumably

reflect the improvement in mortality probabilities.8 Figure 1 indicates
the extent to which the sub—population who choose to buy annuities in fact

have a greater survival probability than the general population. Because
of this greater life expectancy, the present expected values shown in the

greater than the corresponding values shown in the

table's first and second columns, respectively, based on the same two

interest

rates but on general population mortality probabilities. Even

the greater values resulting from the actual company experience mortality

probabilities, however, are still uniformly smaller than even the lowest
corresponding

premiums shown in Table 1. Even within the sub—population who

voluntarily buy annuities, therefore, the price is not actuarially fair.
Table 3 summarizes the differences between the actual premiums

charged on this basic annuity contract and the corresponding actuarially
fair values by showing the 1968-8 3 average of the ratio of premium charged

to present expected value, for each of the four premiums reported in Table 1

and each of the four present expected value calculations reported in Table 2.
The resulting average load factors range from a low of 1.06 for the smallest
premium charged by any cottany in Best' s sa1e, compared to the present
expected value based on Government bond yields and actual coIany experience

mortality probabilities, to a high of 1.55 for the largest premium charged
by any of the ten largest insurers, compared to the present expected value
based on direct placement yields and general population mortality tables.
The comparisons in Table 3 that are probably most relevant for studying
economy—wide individual behavior are those shown in the first row for the mean

premium charged by the ten largest insurers versus the present expected value
based on either Government bond yields or direct placement yields, and on

either general population or company experience mortality probabilities.
The load factor of 1.32 for the first case considered means that a 65—year—old
U.S. male, randomly selected from that population, and for whom the Government

bond yield represents the opportunity cost of capital, typically pays
$1.32 for each $1.00 of expected present value when he purchases a life annuity.

the (on average longer-lived) sub-population of 65-year-old U.S.

males who actually choose to buy life annuities, the load factor based on
the same

dollar

opportunity cost is only 1.18.

In other words, of the

32c per

load factor to the general population, 14 represents the effect

of adverse selection and the remaining l8 the combination of transactions

costs, taxes and profit to the insurer. If the annuity purchaser's
opportunity cost of capital is instead the direct placement yield — for
example, because of ability to buy shares in packages of intermediated

private securities — then the load faôtor per dollar of expected present
value is 48, of which 15' represents the effect of adverse selection
and the remaining 33 the insurer' s co st.s, taxes and profit . As the
Appendix Table shows, these results for 65 year-old males are similar to

those for females, or for males of different ages.
The question for cons tion—saving behavior, then, is whether an

average load factor of 1.18 (or even 1.48) is sufficient to account for

the smell participation in the individual life annuity market in the

United States. In short, do most elderly retired

people choose not to

out of their wealth, arid therefore leave unintentional bequests,
merely because they are reluctant to pay $1.18 (or $1.48) for every $1.O.O.
consume

of present expected value of annuities?

It is difficult to answer this question on the basis of casual evidence
only. At first thought, a load factor of this magnitude seems a large price
to pay for pooling risk. Nevertheless,, it is not out of line with
loads charged elsewhere in the insurance business, in product lines that

alxst everyone buys. For exa1e, data from Best's Key Rating Guide:
Property—Casualty indicate that the recent average load factor in premiums

charged for property and casualty insurance written by large coiranies has
been 1.37 —essentially the same as that on individual life annuities.

—9—

Moreover, despite the apparently large load factor, individual
life annuities are not a "dominated asset" in the sense that the cost
per unit of pay-off, unadjusted for mortality probabilities, is
greater than the analogous cost of alternative investment vehicles.
Table 4 shows the present value of a 35-year certain $1 monthly annuity,
calculated using the two interest rates used in Tables 1 and 2, respectively,

for each year during l968_83.10 As comparison to the first column of Table
1 shows, the value of the certain annuity based on the government bond
yield exceeded the mean premium on the life annuity charged by the ten
largest insurers in all years of the sample except 1980-82, while the value

on the direct placement yield exceeded the mean premium in all years
until 1979.

II. A Model of Saving and Annuity Demand11
The model used in Friedman and Warshawsky (1985) to analyze
the demand for individual life annuities in the context of life-cycle
saving and a bequest motive is an annuity analog of Fischer's (1973)

model of the demand for life insurance, generalized to incorporate fixed
mandatory holdings of socially provided annuities.'2 The individual's
decision problem in this expanded life—cycle context is to maximize

expected

Ut(c) is utility received from consumption C at time t, and vt÷i(G+,)
is utility received from (anticipation of) a bequest G at time t+l.

Following Fischer, it is convenient to specify the two utility functions

in

the iso—elastic form

V(Gt) =

where

(2)

is the Pratt—Arrow coefficient of relative risk aversion, a is the

time preference parameter, and b (in comparison to at) indicates the
relative utility attached to bequests left in period t.
The usual life—cycle specification of behavior with no bequest motive
is therefore just

the

speical case of this model with bt=0 for all t>O.

i. i—

In general, however, people may

value

bequests, and they may value them

differently at different times. The application of the model in Section III
below follows Yaari's suggestion that bt follows a hump-shaped pattern
with higher values during the years when family dependency is important,
so that bt is declining

The individual's problem is to maximize (1) subject to a given
initial wealth position and to a nonnegativity constraint on wealth in
each subsequent time period, given the menu of available investment
opportunities (including any mandatory holding of socially provided

and their respective

annuities)

must

decide

each period the individual

not only how much of current wealth to consume but also how

to allocate the remainder among the available investment vehicles. The
specific asset menu considered here includes a riskless one—period bond

bearing gross rate of return Rt a one—period social annuity bearing gross
rate of return

to survivors, and a

one—period market annuity bearing

gross rate of return Q to survivors.15 Both annuities

With little relevant loss of generality, it is convenient to set Rt constant

optimal consumption and portfolio decisions for the immediately prior period,

given wealth remaining at that time. An individual alive at t=w-x-2 will

observation that in fact only few individuals actually purchase life
annuities, it is then possible to assess the reasonableness of the assumed
values of the model's other parameters — including, in particular, the
with

strength of the bequest motive.

This treatment of the cost of annuities captures the chief implications
of the fact that, although the model in principle refers to one—period

annuities, in fact the annuities available for purchase are life annuities.
Even when an individual makes monthly annuity purchases over time,

as in many defined contribution retirement plans, what he is buying each

month is an additional life annuity. It is therefore plausible to treat
the

load factors or annuity premiums shown in Table 3 in a lump-sum

fashion, not as a load to be repeated in every period.
The simplest place to begin is the special case of the model
developed in Section II corresponding to the standard life cycle model

with neither bequest motive nor Social Security (which is equivalent to the
model in

Kotlikoff and Spivak).

until

the assumed maximum

life span (age 110).

The first simulation considered within this traditional life cycle
context represents the case in which market annuities (like social annuities
here) are unavailable. The individual' s only choice is therefore how much

to cons in each period, since the unconsumed portion of initial wealth
is autotically invested in one-year bonds. The first column of Table S
shows the opt iir1

age—cons

ution profile,

while the second column shows

corresponding i1ied profile of remaining wealth (consisting entirely
of bonds), with both sets of values stated as percentages of initial
wealth. These simulated values ilNnediately indicate the important
the

contrast between reality and the

model' s

assumptions, in that they show the

optility of a declining age—consuixtion profile and a sharply declining
age—wealth profile — phenomena not observed in available dáta.
The second simulation within this traditional life cycle context,
sinnmrized in the remaining columns of Table 5, shows that simply relaxing

the assumption that market annuities are unavailable avoids this strikingly

counterfactual result only at the expense of leading to another. This
simulation differs from the first one in assuming that individual life

annuities are available in the private market at an actuarially fair price
(QA=p/(1_q)) and the table reports values for optimal consumption as well

as optimal wealth holdings in bonds and annuities,respectively.2° In this

case, the individual's optimal course of action is to hold no bonds at all

—18—

but

to stabilize the age-consumption profile almost completely by investing

all wealth in annuities. The implied flat age—consumption profile is
roughly consistent with the available evidence, but the implied large demand

there is little individual demand for life annuities, some other assumption

One possibility,

to invest all of total wealth other than Social Security in

Security the proportional initial wealth increment required to render the

individual as well off without as with a private annuity market is M= .33.

Hence it would still be preferable to put all of total wealth other than

Social Security (that is, one-half of total wealth) into private annuities
rather than buy none at all, as long as the annuity load factor did not
exceed L*=l .66 (=1 + .33/ .5) — again far greater than the load factors
actually observed. n analogous simulation based on the lower risk

aversion value of =2 (not shown in the table) produces alnst identical
results, with M=.3l and a critical load factor L*=l.62.

The potential elanation for the observed behavior that is of
greatest interest in the context of this paper is that, in general, people
may value not just their own consumption but also bequests. Table 8 presents

three further pairs of simulations of the fully general model developed in
Section

II, in each case based on the same

(including

assumptions as in Table 7

the prominent role for Social Security) and, in addition, a

positive bequest motive. The first of these three pairs of simulations assumes
the bequest motive 0=2, which is quite modest given the stock-flow dimension
of 0, and the model's use

of

an annual time unit, and =4. The second pair

of simulations assumes 0=8. The third pair assumes 0=24.

The simulation results reported in Tablo

S

show that even a very

modest bequest motive is sufficient to eliminate one of the importantly

counterfactual aspects of the earlier simulations. In particular, because
of

the bequest motive it is no longer optimal to invest all of total

wealth

of

other than Social Security in private annuities. The

wealth invested

in

fraction

bonds varies positively with the strength

of the bequest motive, but even 0=2 is sufficient to make optimal bond

holdings neither zero nor trivially small. Ibreover, optimal bond holdings
do not decrease (until the final year they actually increase slightly) with
age. Hence the

general

is consistent with

model,

with even

a modest positive bequest motive,

observed behavior in ilying an

approximately flat

part of wealth held in non-annuity form.
By contrast, the results for all three pairs of simulations shown
in Table 8 continue to be counterfactual in ilying that, when private
annuities are available, it is optimal to use a large fraction of total
wealth other than Social Security to purchase them. Further analysis,
however, indicates that here the load factor in annuity pricing is
age-wealth profile for the

potentially very iiortant.
For the weak bequest motive 0=2, the proportional initial wealth
increment required to render the individual as well off without as with a
private annuity market

is

M=.22. The critical load factor necessary to

make buying no annuities at all preferable to investing 41% of initial
wealth in annuities is therefore L*=1.53 (=1 +

.22/.41),

again above the

observed load factors reported in Table 3 for the mean premiums charged by
the ten largest insurers, regardless of the mortality probabilities and the
interest rate used in the calculations.

For 0=8, the initial wealth increment required to render the individual

—22—

as well off without as with a private annuity market is only M=.l8, so
that the critical load factor that would make buying no annuities at all

preferable to investing 38% of initial wealth in annuities is L*=l.47. As
Table 3 shows, this load factor is approximately equal to that charged on
average by the largest ten insurers if the underlying present expected value
calculation relies on general population mortality probabilities and the

interest rate on corporate direct placements. Nevertheless, it still
exceeds the implied load factor confronting an individual who knows that
bis

mortality

probabilities are characteristic of other annuity purchasers,

or whose opportunity cost of funds is the government bond yield (or who
searches

for the lowest available premilmi)

Filially,

for 0=24, the initial wealth increint required to render

the individual as well off without as with a private annuity market is M=l .14.

nce the critical load factor that would make buying no annuities at
all preferable to investing 35% of initial wealth in annuities is L*=l.40,
about in the middle

between

the actual load factor based on general

population mortality probabilities and the direct placement yield and the
actual load factor based on alternative assuntions.
Under

sets of plausible assumptions, therefore, importantly
including a positive bequest motive, the actual load factor included in
sons

the premiums on individual life annuities sold in the United States is
sufficient to make people prefer buying no annuities at all over buying
the amount that would be optimal if annuity prices were actuarially fair.
Although this finding is

role

hardly

without interest, since

it indicates

a joint

for the bequest motive and for annuity load factors in explaining the

observed behavior, it still does not fully explain the fact that almost no

one buys any individual life annuities. Nothing forces people to choose

—23—

between buying either the amount of annuities that would be optimal at

actuarially fair prices or buying none at all. Hence showing under
what conditions people would prefer no annuities at all to the amount
they would purchase at actuarially fair prices still does not establish
the conditions under which they would not buy some amount that is

significant albeit less than the actuarially fair optimum. For the
assumed values of 0, R,

and S underlying the simulations reported in

Table 8, for example, and for an assumed annuity load factor of L=l.40

(the

critical value for 0=24) ,

the

strength of the bequest motive required

to make the individual indifferent between purchasing private annuities
equal to 1% of initial wealth (including Social Security) and purchasing

none at all is 0=343 —

Both because the quantitative importance of bequests in overall

saving is a question with major implications for both positive and normative

issues,25 and also because there is little other way to evaluate the

plausibility

of values of 0 within the logically admissible range, it is

interesting to see just how large these results suggest that the typical

bequest should be. Table 10 shows, for each of the combinations of
parameter values considered in Table 9, and in each case for the value of the
bequest motive parameter 0 (as shown in Table 9) needed to render the

individual indifferent between investing 1% of initial wealth in private

corresponding bequest/consumption ratio (G /C
w—X w-x—l ).

For the most part

these estimates are closely bunched, despite the wide variation in the
underlying parameter values, typically

indicating a bequest equal to

two to four times the final year's consumption. Especially for the lower
end of the range, these estimates appear to be empirically plausible.26
Given the respective roles of S, R and

in affecting the demand

for annuities in the model developed in Section II, their corresponding
roles here in determining the strength of bequest motive necessary to

eliminate that demand (for a given load factor) is straightforward. The

important, smaller as the rate of return is higher, and greater as

more risk averse. Hence the bequest motive implied by the

fact that few people buy individual life annuities is weaker as Social
Security is more important, weaker as the rate of return is higher, and
stronger as people are more risk averse.

sum, the results shown in Tables 9 and 10 indicate that for

to explain the absence of purchases of

life annuities. This finding lends strength to the view that

desired bequests are an important element in consumption—saving behavior.
Moreover, when Social

Security is less important and people are more

risk averse, the bequest motive assumes an especially large role in

explaining why so few people buy annuities. Under these circumstances the
indicated bequest is at least four times final consumption.

iv. Conclusion and Further Thoughts
The

observed reluctance of most individuals in

the

United States

to buy individual life annuities, and the concominitant approximately flat
average age—wealth profile, stand in sharp contradiction to the standard

life cycle model of consumption-saving behavior. The analysis in this
paper lends support to an explanation for this phenomenon based on the

interaction of an intentional bequest motive and annuity prices that are

not actuarially fair.
Premiums charged for individual life annuities in the United States
do include a load factor of 32—48 per dollar, or l8—33 per dollar after
allowing for adverse selection, in conarison to actuarially fair annuity

values. Load

factors of this size are

Simulations

behavior, allowing

for uncertain lifetiits and Social Security, show that the load

factor charged would have to be far larger than this to account for the
observed behavior in the absence of a bequest motive. By contrast, the
combination of a load factor in this range and a positive bequest motive, can
do so for some plausible values of the assumed underlying parameters. Moreover,

if this combination of factors is leading elderly individuals to avoid

purchasing life annuities, it implies a typical bequest that is fairly large.
in comparison to their consumption.

As the authors' earlier work has already emphasized, caution is
appropriate

in relying on these conclusions without further research.

Although the model used here does generalize the standard life—cycle model
in several potentially important ways, it still excludes a priori a variety
of further possible explanations for the observed behavior:27 First, many

—26—

people at least say that they choose stable age-wealth profiles, rather
than either buying annuities or simply consuming out of wealth, not because
of mortality considerations but from fear of the consequences of

catastrophic illness. Second, while the analysis here follows the recent
literature by impilcity working in real terms, the individual life
annuities available in U.S. markets quarantee specified nominal payments.
Third, the analysis here does not allow for several more complex kinds
of possible interactions within families, including, for example, either
non-altruistic ("manipulativet') bequests or intra-family risk sharing.28

Finally, in contrast to the reliance here (and in just about all of the
available literature on the subject) on the standard theory of expected

utility

maximization, there is evidence that, especially when the prospect

of rare events is involved, individuals systematically overweight the

probability of rare events. 29
These further possible explanations for the fact that few people
purchase

individual life annuities

remain as objects for future research.

application of it to the demand for life insurance.

age x. Writing them as p(x) and q(x)1 would be appropriate but
would clutter an already cumbersome notation. Conditionality on
x is to be understood, here and below.
14. In a more general context it would also be necessary to take account
of labor income. The focus of this paper, however, is on the elderly
retired population.
15. As in Fischer (1973), the assumption of one—period annuities makes
the analysis tractable. The annuities actually available for purchase

in the United States are instead life annuities.

16. The model as written here imposes no nonriegativity constraint on choice
parameter A — that is, it does not explicitly preclude short sales of
annuities. For most reasonable values of the given parameters, however,
large short sales are not optimal anyway. If they were, imposing a
nonnegativity constraint in solving the model would be straightforward.

17. The time profile in (17) is from Fischer's Appendix Table A2,
extended to age 110. Reasoning analogous to that underlying abel's
(1984) model of life insurance markets suggests that the results could be
very sensitive to whether the value of bequests is rising or falling

with t. In particular, a sufficiently negatively sloped bequest

motive can, under some circumstances, give rise to a negative demand
for annuities. The after—age—65 portion of Fischer's time profile,
used

here, makes bt decline approximately in step with
