JEL No. F0,F2,F22,H10
ABSTRACT
This paper tests the differential effects of the generosity of the welfare state under free migration and
under policy-controlled migration, distinguishing between source developing and developed countries.
We utilize free-movement within the EU to examine the free migration regime and compare that to
immigration into the EU from two other groups, developed and developing source countries, to capture
immigration-restricted regimes. We standardize cross-country education quality differences by using
the Hanushek-Woessmann (2009) cognitive skills measure. We find strong support for the "Magnet
Hypothesis" under the free-migration regime, and the "Fiscal Burden Hypothesis" under the immigrationrestricted regime even after controlling for differences in returns to skills in source and host countries.
We also find a significant differences across host-country policy regimes in the effects of returns to
skills on the skill mix of immigrants.

Introduction

Public debate on immigration has increasingly focused on the welfare state
amid concerns that immigrants are a …scal burden as recipients of the generous welfare state. There has also been growing literature on how welfare-state
generosity works as a magnet to migrants. However, the e¤ect of welfare programs on immigration and its composition depends crucially on the policy
regime, namely whether migration is free or restricted. In other words, the
generosity of the welfare state may a¤ect the skill composition of immigrants
di¤erently, depending on the immigration policy adopted. This paper tests
how the generosity of the welfare state a¤ects the skill composition of the
immigrants across these policy regimes.
In a free-migration regime, a typical welfare state with relatively abundant
capital and high total factor productivity (implying relatively high wages for
all skill levels) attracts both unskilled and skilled migrants. On the other
hand, the generosity of the welfare state attracts unskilled (poor) migrants, as
they expect to gain more from the bene…ts of the welfare state than what they
expect to pay in taxes for these bene…ts: that is, they are net bene…ciaries
of the generous welfare state. In contrast, potential skilled (rich) migrants
are deterred by the generosity of the welfare state. Thus the generosity of
the welfare state shifts the migrant skill composition towards the unskilled.
In the restricted-migration regime, these same considerations lead voters to
open the door wide to skilled migration and slam the door shut on unskilled
migration. Voters are motivated by two considerations: how migration a¤ects
their wages, and how it bears on the …nances of the welfare state. Typically,

2

unskilled migration depresses the unskilled wage and boosts the skilled wage.
The opposite occurs with skilled migration. The e¤ect of migration on the
…nances of the welfare state is common to all voters of all skills, because
skilled migrants are net contributors to the welfare state, whereas unskilled
migrants are net bene…ciaries. From a public …nance point of view, nativeborn voters of all skills would therefore opt for the skilled to come and for
the unskilled to stay away to mitigate the …scal burden.
We use core EU countries (old member states) to study empirically the
policy-regime di¤erential e¤ect of the generosity of the welfare state on the
skill composition of migration. Freedom of movement and the ability to reside
and work anywhere within the EU are two of the fundamental rights which
EU member states have must recognise. In contrast, labor mobility into
EU member states from non-EU states is still restricted to various degrees
by national policies.1 The paper utilizes this di¤erence in policy regimes in
EU and non-EU states to test the key di¤erences between free- and policyrestricted migration, in conjunction with the e¤ect of the welfare state on
the skill composition of immigrants.
The paper, which follows from Cohen and Razin (2009), addresses the
1

Despite the legal provision for the free movement of labor among the EU-15 (the old

member countries), the level of cross-border labor mobility is low. Reasons cited for this
include the existence of legal and administrative barriers, the lack of familiarity with other
European languages, moving costs, ine¢ cient housing markets, the limited portability of
pension rights, problems with the international recognition of professional quali…cations
and the lack of transparency of job openings. The expansion of the EU to 25 member states
in May 2004, was accompanied by concerns over the possibility of a wave of migration –
particularly of the low-skilled –from the ten new member states to the EU-15.

e¤ect of the generosity of the welfare state on the skill composition of immigrants. The paper makes three contributions. First, since welfare bene…ts
might be one factor a¤ecting the composition of migrants, we control for
other potential factors that are likely to a¤ect the selectivity of migration.
As Borjas (1987) argues the characteristics of those who emigrate from a
particular country will depend on that country’s wage distribution. In poor
countries, where the returns to skills are relatively high, there will be a
“negative selection” of immigrants; whilst in rich countries, where returns
to skills are relatively low, there will be “positive selection” of immigrants.
Thus we control for both returns to skills in the source country measured
by income inequality, as well as for the wage-premium skill di¤erential in
the host country. Second, the paper considers immigration from developing
source countries as well as developed ones, since the impact of the generosity
of the welfare state on the immigrant skill composition across these policy
regimes may be di¤erent for (poor) developing countries compared to those
from richer developed ones. We consider here a larger sample of source countries, which includes a sample of developing countries in addition to non-EU
OECD countries. We employ bilateral data from the year 2000 on 16 EU
countries (14 out of the EU-15 together with Norway and Switzerland, which
bene…t from free labor mobility bilateral agreements with the EU), 10 nonEU OECD countries, and 23 developing countries.2 Third, because a proper
measure of immigrant skill is key to our analysis, we correct for educational
quality, an issue which has been ignored in the empirical migration literature.
In this way we attempt to obtain a relatively homogeneous classi…cation of
2

Our sample of source countries is dictated by data availability on educational quality.

skill levels using the Hanushek-Woesmann (2009) measure of cognitive skills.
We form source-host pairs of countries in which only the EU countries (plus
Norway and Switzerland) serve as host countries, whereas all the countries
in the sample serve as source countries. We decompose the source-host pairs
into three groups: a "free-migration" group (source-host pairs within the
EU, plus Norway and Switzerland), a "policy-controlled" group of developed
countries (source-host pairs in which the host countries are the same as in
the former group, and the source countries are from non-EU OECD countries), and a "policy-controlled" group of developing countries (source-host
pairs in which the host countries are the same as in the former groups, and
the source countries are from LDC countries). The free-restricted migration
decomposition has its origin in the integration process in Europe that started
in the 1950s, and is thus exogenous to the stock of migrants in the EU states
in 2000.
We also control for the potential endogeneity problem : the skill composition of migration itself may in‡uence the voters’ attitude towards the
generosity of the welfare state. Recalling that skilled migrants are typically
net contributors to the welfare state, whereas unskilled migrants are net
bene…ciaries, voters in the host country are likely to boost its welfare system
when absorbing high-skill migration and curtail it when absorbing low-skill
migration.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section two provides an
overview of the existing literature paying particular attention to the general welfare aspects of migration and the interaction between migration and
the welfare state. Section three presents the data sources and discusses the

5

schooling quality measure. Section four presents the econometric model and
compares the …ndings for LDC source countries relative to DC source countries. Section …ve concludes.

Empirical Evidence on Welfare Migration

Existing literature brings out rich, though mixed, evidence on welfare migration. Several studies examine whether welfare-state generosity acts as a magnet for migrants; see Brueckner (2000) for a detailed review. A few studies
focusing on the US, show that high-bene…t states have more welfare-recipient
migrants than the low-bene…t regions, for example, Southwick (1981) and
Gramlich and Laren (1984). Particular groups seem also to be drawn more
by bene…ts than others. For example, Blank (1988) shows that welfare bene…ts have a signi…cant positive e¤ect on the location choice of female-headed
households. Similarly, Enchautegui (1997) …nds a positive e¤ect of welfare
bene…ts on the migration decision of women with young children. McKinnish
(2005, 2007) also …nds evidence of welfare migration, especially for those who
are located close to state borders (where migration costs are lower). Meyer
(2000) employs a conditional logit model, as well as a comparison-group
method, to analyze the 1980 and 1990 US Census data and …nds signi…cant welfare-induced migration, particularly for high school dropouts. Borjas (1999) …nds that low-skilled migrants are much more heavily clustered in
high-bene…t states, in comparison to other migrants or natives. On the other
hand, Gelbach (2004) …nds strong evidence of welfare migration in 1980, but
less in 1990, whilst Walker (1994) uses the 1990 US Census data and …nds
6

no compelling evidence in support of the welfare magnet theory. Using data
for 1979-92, Levine and Zimmerman (1999), show that welfare bene…ts have
little e¤ect on the probability of female-headed households (the recipients of
the bene…ts) to relocate.
Empirical studies on the evidence of welfare migration in Europe and
OECD countries also provide mixed conclusions. Khoudouz-Castezas (2004)
studies emigration from 19th century Europe. He …nds that the social insurance legislation, adopted by Bismarck in the 1880s, reduced the incentives of
risk averse Germans to emigrate. He estimates that in the absence of social
insurance, the German emigration rate from 1886 to 1913 would have been
more than double its actual level. Peridy (2006) studies migration rates in 18
OECD host countries from 67 source countries and …nds that the host-source
ratio of welfare-state bene…ts (as measured by total public spending) has a
signi…cant positive e¤ect on migration. De Giorgi and Pellizzari (2006) conduct an empirical investigation of migration from outside the EU-15. They
…nd that welfare-state bene…ts attract migrants. When interacted with the
education level, welfare bene…ts also show a positive e¤ect on the probability
of the lowest group of educated to immigrate; whereas the probabilities of the
secondary and tertiary education groups are not signi…cantly a¤ected. Docquier et al. (2006) study the determinants of migration stocks in the OECD
countries in the year 2000, with migrants from 184 countries, classi…ed according to three education levels. They …nd that the social welfare programs
encourage the migration of both skilled and unskilled workers. However, the
unskilled are motivated by social expenditure much more than the skilled
migrants. Thus they conclude that the skill composition of migrants is ad-

7

versely a¤ected by welfare-state bene…ts, that is, welfare bene…ts encourage
migration biased towards the unskilled.
Unlike the above studies, our focus in this paper is about the e¤ect of the
welfare state on the composition of immigrants. Hence, it is paramount to
control for the migration regime (free versus controlled) in order to obtain
unbiased estimates of the generosity of the welfare state on migration (and
on its skill composition). Studies of migration between states within the US,
which are clearly con…ned to a single migration regime (namely, free migration), can help only in providing evidence of a free-migration regime. On the
other hand, studies that employ samples con…ned to the policy-controlled migration regime, but at the same time employ a model of the migrants’choice
whether to migrate and to which country, are evidently problematic. In this
case, the estimates convey little information about the migrants’choices (and
hence on the welfare state as a magnet to unskilled migrants), but rather on
the migration policy choices of the host country. Finally, studies that refer
to both migration regimes without controlling for them are problematic because they do not disentangle migration policies in the host countries, and
the individual migrant’s migration choices in the source countries.

Empirical Analysis

Our aim is to test how the generosity of the welfare state a¤ects the skill
composition of immigrants across policy regimes for both developing and
developed source countries after controlling for returns to skills in source
and host countries. It is common to focus on developed countries (OECD
8

countries) where skill levels (usually proxied by education attainment) are
comparable given the potential heterogeneity in education quality across developed and developing countries. We do not con…ne ourselves to developed
countries in this paper but include a sample of developing countries for which
we are able to control for the quality of education as described below.
In order to identify the di¤erence in the welfare-state bene…ts e¤ect on the
skill composition of immigrants across migration regimes, the decomposition
of the sample into group A, and groups B and C should be exogenous to the
dependent variable–the skill composition of migrants. We argue that this is
indeed the case for EU countries.

3.1

Data

We decompose our sample into three groups as follows. Group A contains
only the source-host pairs of countries which allow free mobility of labor
between them, according to the single-market treaty. Any kind of discrimination between native-born and immigrants, regarding labor market accessibility and welfare-state bene…ts eligibility is illegal. These are 16 European countries: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,
Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, UK, Norway
and Switzerland.
Group B includes only the developed source-host pairs of countries within
which the source country residents cannot freely move, work and receive
social bene…ts in any of the host countries. The source countries, however,
are ten developed countries: US, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand,
Israel, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea and Singapore.
9

Group C includes the developing source-host pairs of countries in which
the source country residents cannot freely move, work and receive social bene…ts in any of the host countries. Twenty three developing countries are
included: Argentina, Brazil, Chile China, Colombia, Ecuador, Egypt, Jordan, India, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Lebanon, Nigeria,
Peru, Philippines, Tunisia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey and Venezuela.
In both groups B and C, the host countries are the same EU countries as
in group A. We distinguish between LDC and DC source countries and run
separate regressions in order to compare the e¤ect of the welfare state in
both cases. The determinants of emigration and the e¤ects of the generosity
of the welfare state are likely to be di¤erent for poor developing countries
relative to richer, developed ones:- e.g., the gap between the host and source
countries in terms of wages, amenities, social spending and welfare are largers
for developing countries.
The analysis uses bilateral migration data from Docquier and Marfouk
(2006). The data contain bilateral immigrant stocks, based on census and
register data, for the years 1990 and 2000. Immigrants of a working age (25+)
are de…ned as foreign-born. The immigrants are classi…ed into three education levels: low-skilled (0-8 schooling years), medium-skilled (9-12 schooling
years) and high-skilled (13+ schooling years). The data also contain the
stock of the domestic-origin labor force for all the countries.
Data for social spending is based on the OECD’s Analytical Database (average for 1974-1990). Social expenditure encompass all kinds of social public
expenditures, in cash or in kind, including, for instance, old-age transfers,
incapacity related bene…ts, health care, unemployment bene…ts and other

10

social expenditure. Social spending is in PPP 1990 US dollars and is divided
by the population of the host country to provide per capita bene…ts.

3.2

Quality of Education and Enforcement of Immigration Policies

Since our interest is in the e¤ect of the welfare state on the skill composition
of immigrants, controlling for the heterogeneity in the skill (education) measurement is important. Policies controlling for immigration typically ignore
di¤erences in the educational quality of source countries. Thus immigrants
with the same years of schooling may be treated equally in a points system,
although in reality they may vary in their labor market productivity, causing
di¤erent …scal burdens. This may introduce a bias in our estimates–in particular for LDC source countries. On one hand, if immigration policies favor
higher educational attainment immigrants and one does not control for the
quality of education, this would overestimate the e¤ect of skill composition
for LDC source countries. On the other hand if high educated immigrants are
of poor quality then their productivity would not be that di¤erent from the
low-skilled ones and they would behave similarly to the low-skilled migrants–
in being net recipient rather than contributors to the welfare state, resulting
in an underestimate of the e¤ect of welfare generosity on the skill composition. Thus not controlling for educational quality is problematic since we
cannot know a priori which way that would bias our results. We control for
educational quality of immigrants from all source countries. Hence our migration skill composition is adjusted for varying source country skill quality.
Although Docquier and Marfouk (2006) provide comparable educational
11

levels, there is still potentially a very large variation between the quality
of educational degrees across countries. To address this potential problem,
we adjust all the migration stocks for quality of education using Hanushek
and Woessmann (2009) new measures of international di¤erences of cognitive
skills.
Hanushek and Woessmann (2009) use international assessments of student achievement such as the First International Mathematics Study (FIMS),
the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and
the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). A total of 12
international student achievement tests (ISATs) were collected. Although
varying across the individual assessments, to obtain a common measure of
cognitive skills, they rely upon information about the overall distribution of
scores on each ISAT to compare national responses. In order to compare
performance on the ISATs across tests and over time, they project the performance of di¤erent countries on di¤erent tests onto a common metric. For
that, they develop a common metric both for the level and for the variation
of test performance. To make the level of ISATs comparable, they use the
only available information on educational performance that is consistently
available for comparisons over time: namely, in the form of the National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) from the United States, which
has tested the math, science and reading performance of nationally representative samples of 9-, 13-, and 17-year-old US students in an intertemporally
comparable way since 1969. The United States is also the only country that
has participated in every ISAT.
Their main measure of cognitive skills is a simple average of all standard-

12

ized math and science test scores of the ISATs in which a country participated. They use a group of countries to serve as a standardization benchmark for performance variation over time, and choose 13 OECD countries
that already had substantial enrollment in secondary education in 1964 and
have had relatively stable education systems, which they term the “OECD
Standardization Group”(OSG) of countries. Then for each assessment, they
calibrate the variance in country mean scores for the subset of the OSG participating to the variance observed on the PISA tests in 2000 (when all OSG
countries participated). By combining the adjustments in levels (based on
the US NAEP scores) and the adjustment in variances (based on the OSG),
they directly calculate standardized scores for all countries on all assessments. Each age group and subject is normalized to the PISA standard of
mean 500 and individual standard deviation of 100 across OECD countries
(see Appendix B in Hanushek and Woessmann (2009) for full details).
Hanushek and Woessmann (2009) use their schooling quality measure
to provide evidence on the robust association between cognitive skills and
economic growth. They also …nd that home-country cognitive-skill levels
strongly a¤ect the earnings of immigrants in the US labor market in a
di¤erence-in-di¤erences model that compares home-educated to US-educated
immigrants from the same country of origin. Thus suggesting that controlling
for the quality of schooling is important.
We use their imputed average test scores in math and science for primary
through end of secondary school, all years (scaled to PISA scale divided
by 100) for all source countries in our sample as our measure of Education
Quality (EQ). We interact all the migration stock shares by EQ to adjust

13

for varying quality of education across countries. It is important to note two
caveats due to the constraints of this quality measure. First, this quality
measure does not vary over time since it is an average for various years thus
we use the same measure for migration stocks in the 1990s and 2000s. Second,
we use the same quality measure for the three educational levels. However,
we check for the robustness of our quality of education by using di¤erent
methods to adjust for quality of education across countries.
Table A1 shows the test scores for math and science scores based on
Hanushek and Woessmann (2009). One interesting issue is that education
quality varies not only between developed and developing countries but also
between developed countries and the EU: the average for the EU (Group A)
is 4.939, whilst for Group B (DCs) it is 5.132 and for Group C (LDCs) it is
only 3.99. This suggests that there might be a need to control for quality of
education not only when considering developing countries but also developed
ones.

where  denotes the stock of migrants of skill level  (comprised of  skilled
and  unskilled), who originated from source country  and reside in host
country , as a ratio of the stock of all native workers of skill level  in the
source country in the year 2000.  is a dummy variable, which equals 0 if
the source-host pair exercises free migration, and 1 otherwise.  denotes the
log average bene…ts per capita in host country  over the period 1974-1990.
The remaining control variables are denoted by  , which include the stock
of unskilled migrants, from source country  in host country  as a ratio of
the stock of all native unskilled migrants in the source country  in the year
1990; a similar ratio for skilled migrants; the proportion of unskilled nativeborn workers in the host country  in year 1990; and a similar proportion for
the skilled.3 We also have interaction terms of all variables with the policy
regime dummy variable. The coe¢ cients are depicted by the vectors . The

 ,

error term is denoted by
skill-independent e¤ect,

 ,

which can be divided into two components: a

and a skill-dependent term,



This simple model estimates the e¤ects of the bene…ts per capita (and
the other control variables) on the migration share,  , for each skill level
 =  . Note that



re‡ects some omitted variables which are skill-

independent. In order to avoid the omitted-variable bias which is skillindependent, we de…ne a skill-di¤erence model (a version of di¤erence-indi¤erence model), by subtracting the two equations in (1) and obtain

The dependent variable, 4 =  ¬  , can be considered as a

measure for the skill composition of migrants in the year 2000. Equation (2)
estimates the relative e¤ects of the regressors on 4 . A positive estimation of a certain coe¢ cient indicates a positive e¤ect on the skill composition
measure of the migrants, and vice versa. Note that the e¤ect of welfare state
generosity on the skill composition of the migrants under free migration is
captured in the above equation by the coe¢ cient

2.

Therefore, the null

hypothesis describing this e¤ect is:
2

 0

(3)

In addition, the e¤ect of welfare state generosity on the skill composition
of migrants in the case of restricted migration is captured by the coe¢ cient
2

+

3.

Therefore the null hypothesis describing this e¤ect is:
3

 0

(4)

An important statistical feature of the di¤erence-in-di¤erence model is
that it eliminates the skill-independent error term,

 .

Any variable whose

impact on migration is skill-invariant drops out. Furthermore, by including
past migration stocks by skill in 1990 as a part of  , we are able to account
for other invariant e¤ects.
We also control for other factors that are likely to be skill dependent as
follows. First, we attempt to control for other immigration policy measures
in the host country that might have an e¤ect on the skill composition of
immigrants. We use refugees as a share in total immigrants in 1990 in the
16

host country based on the United Nations Population Division Statistics.4 To
capture the e¤ect of family re-uni…cation schemes adopted in host countries
we use the stock of past migrants from the source country in the host country
in 1990. Both variables are expected to have a negative impact on the migrant
skill mix, since both policies attract low-skilled migrants.
Second, since the generosity of the welfare state might be one of the
factors in‡uencing immigration and its composition, we need to control for
other push-pull factors. One important determinant of migration is the wage
di¤erential or the skill di¤erential between source and host countries. We
use real GDP per capita (PPP) in 1990, constant US dollars, for both host
and source countries in the absence of data on wages in the source countries.
We also use average unemployment rates (average for 1990-1995) in both
source and host countries.5 In addition, to capture better other pull factors
which are likely to a¤ect immigration selectivity a battery of controls is used:
(i) inequality measures (Gini coe¢ cient) in the source country in 1990;6 (ii)
as a proxy for the returns to skill in the host country, the log value of the
skilled-unskilled native labor stock ratio in 1990; (iii) instead of (ii), for the
host country, the ratio of skilled-unskilled wage di¤erential measured by the
ratio of labor compensation per employee in US dollars PPP in 19957 ; and
4

Unfortunately, we were not able to obtaib data on the number or share of refugees

for source-host pairs. We have also experimented with using the number of refugees and
asylum seekers in the host in 1997, and all our results were robust.

Additional controls, such as the distance between source-host countries,
which might deter unskilled immigrants more than skilled ones, and samelanguage in source-host countries, which might make immigration particularly attractive for unskilled workers are included. We also control for quantity of education using average years of schooling (+25 years ) in the source
country, extracted from the World Bank World Development Indicators, in
addition to adjusting for educational quality as mentioned above.
A potential endogeneity problem may arise– in particular between the
level of bene…ts in the host country,  , and the skill composition of the
migrants,

 , because skilled immigrants can in‡uence the political eco-

nomic equilibrium level of bene…ts. One way to address this problem is to
use the average level of bene…ts over a long period before the year 2000, as
we indeed do (using 1974-1990 data). Recall that we also control for the past
migration stock rate (in 1990). Thus only migration from 1990-2000 is to be
explained by the lagged bene…t variable, which is completely predetermined.
In addition, we also instrument the lagged level of bene…ts in the host
country,  , using the legal origin in the host country (English, Scandinavian,
or French-German) as an instrument. We also instrument the interaction
  using the interaction between the legal origin and The legal origin,

a century-old construct, was put in place without having the 2000 migration
in mind. The legal origin is, however, closely linked to national attitudes

is therefore likely to be strongly correlated with  , yet with little direct

Main Findings

Table 1 presents the OLS estimation results for both DCs and LDCs for
our variables of interest. Our …rst hypothesis relates to the e¤ect of welfare
state bene…ts on the skill composition of immigrants within free-migration
regime. This hypothesis is indeed con…rmed (the …rst row) for Group A. The
coe¢ cient is negative and signi…cant. That is, the generosity of the welfare
state adversely a¤ects the skill composition of migrants in the free-migration
regime, capturing the market-based supply-side e¤ect. The inclusion of the
returns to skill proxy measured by the skilled-unskilled native labor stocks
ratio in the host country in 1990 (column 2), or (column 3) the skilledunskilled wage di¤erential does not have much of an e¤ect on the magnitude
or signi…cance of the coe¢ cients of the welfare-state bene…ts.
Our second hypothesis relates to the considerations of the host country’s voters in policy-controlled migration regimes. We have argued that the
di¤erence between the e¤ect of …scal bene…ts between the controlled and freemigration regimes should be positive. Indeed, the coe¢ cient is positive and
signi…cantly di¤erent than that in the free migration regimes (second row)
for DCs (Group B). That is, the e¤ect of the generosity of the welfare state
on the skill composition of migrants is positively a¤ected by the migration
19

policy of the host countries. However the coe¢ cient is not always signi…cant
for LDCs (Group C) suggesting our a priori concern about the endogeneity
of welfare bene…ts. Similar results are obtained when using migration stocks
that are adjusted for quality of education, i.e.

  (see Table 2).

Turing to Table 3 which presents the IV estimates, it is important to note
that the …rst stage Cragg-Donald F-statistics show that our instruments are
not subject to weak instrument concerns. Indeed, we …nd evidence for our
…rst hypothesis, i.e. a negative and signi…cant e¤ect of welfare-state bene…ts on the skill composition of immigrants within a free-migration regime.
The generosity of the welfare-state adversely a¤ects the skill composition of
migrants in the free-migration regime. As predicted, using the IV, we …nd
the e¤ect of the generosity of the welfare-state on the skill composition of
migrants under the policy-controlled migration regime is positive, for both
developed (Group B, Column 1) and developing countries (Group C, Column
4). This result also holds after controlling for all the other push-pull factors
(Columns 2 and 3 for DCs and Columns 5 and 6 for LDCs).
One important …nding is that the e¤ect of the generosity tends to be larger
for DCs relative to LDCs. In other words, a generous welfare state leads to
a larger positive e¤ect on the skill composition of migrants from DCs under
policy-controlled migration relative to that from LDCs. Overall, our results
suggest that 1% increase in welfare-state bene…t spending would improve the
skill composition of LDCs migrants by around 2.0% and of DCs migrants by
around 3.5%. There are potentially several reasons for the di¤erence of welfare spending on migrant skill composition between LDCs and DCs. First, it
could be because policies controlling for immigration typically ignore di¤er-

20

ences in educational quality, thus we correct for low schooling quality, since
immigrants with the same years of schooling may vary in their productivity
in the labor market, causing di¤erent …scal burdens. Second, it could also be
due to the family re-uni…cation and refugee immigration policies adopted by
EU countries–distorting the skill composition for LDCs immigrants–which
we control for by using imperfect proxies: namely, percentage of refugees in
host and total migrant stock from source in host rather than the percentage
of refugees in host from source and the stock of family reunion migrants from
source in host.
Table 4 presents IV estimates using migration stocks that are adjusted
for quality of education. It is clear that our previous results pertaining to
the negative e¤ect of the welfare-state bene…ts on the skill composition of
immigrants within the free-migration regime but a positive e¤ect within the
restricted-migration regime for both Groups B and C hold after adjusting for
the quality of education. However, it is also worth noting that our …ndings
suggest that controlling for quality of education does strengthen the positive
e¤ect of the skill composition of LDCs and hardly changes the estimate for
DCs, thus narrowing the gap between the e¤ects for LDCs vs. DCs. Thus
a 1% increase in welfare-state bene…t spending would improve the skill composition of LDCs migrants by around 2.5% and of DCs migrants by around
3.4%.
Turning to the other control variables, the variables capturing immigration policies adopted in the EU have negative e¤ects, as expected: the share
of refugees in total migrants in the host country in 1990 has a negative, albeit
insigni…cant, e¤ect whilst the total migrant stock from the source country

21

in the host country in 1990 has a negative insigni…cant e¤ect on the skill
composition for DC immigrants and a negative signi…cant impact on LDC
immigrant skill composition.
Finally, examining the di¤erential e¤ect of returns to skills under the two
policy regimes, we …nd, interestingly, that inequality in the source country
has a negative signi…cant e¤ect on the skill mix of migrants from both LDCs
and DCs under restrictive migration and a positive e¤ect under free migration. As for the relative returns to skill in the host, the higher the high-low
labor ratio, the lower are the returns to skill and the lower are the skill composition of immigrants. However, this e¤ect seems to be signi…cant only for
DCs. Indeed, using the wage di¤erential between high- and low- skilled in the
host country, which is a better measure of returns to skills, shows that there
is a positive relationship between the returns to skill and the skill composition of migrants for both DCs and LDCs under controlled migration, and no
di¤erential e¤ect for free migration. Thus overall, the results indicate that
even after controlling for returns to skills, the generosity of the welfare state
matters for the skill composition of immigrants.

4.2

Robustness Tests

We check the robustness of our …ndings as follows. Our robustness tests are
divided into two parts. First, we check the robustness of our results using
di¤erent methods to adjust for the quality of education. We use relative
quality of education in the source country versus the host country and interact that with the migration stocks, i.e.


  
(Table 5). We then


adjust only the high-skilled migration stock by interacting with the relative
22

source to host quality of education i.e.   (Table 6). All our results
are robust and the magnitude of the impact of the welfare-state spending on
the compositional migration mix is similar to our results in Table 4.
Second, we use di¤erent cuts for the skill composition. We examine the
di¤erence between high from medium plus low (Table 7). Then we observe
the di¤erence between high plus medium from low (Table 8). We present the
estimates using education quality adjusted migration stocks. The results are
perfectly in line with our main …ndings.

Conclusion

Welfare generosity is seen by many as a magnet for immigration. Yet, the
e¤ect of the welfare state on immigration and its composition depends on
whether the adopted migration policy regime is free or controlled. We argue
that welfare-state bene…ts attract unskilled migrants because they contribute
to tax revenues less than what they gain from bene…ts; and this generosity
deters skilled immigrants, because they contribute more in taxes than they
receive in bene…ts. In sharp contrast, the e¤ect of an increase in the generosity of the welfare state on the skill composition of migrants is positive,
if migration is controlled by policy. Being net contributors to the welfare
state, skilled migrants can help …nance a more generous welfare-state system. Thus they are preferred by policy makers to unskilled migrants. The
present paper analyzes the e¤ect of the generosity of the welfare state on the
skill composition of migrants distinguishing, between immigrants from LDCs
versus DCs. We examine the e¤ect of a generous the welfare-state (measured
23

as per capita social spending) on the skill composition of migrants under
free- versus controlled- migration regimes controlling for the role played by
returns to skills in both the source and host countries.
We use bilateral data from the year 2000 on 16 EU countries (14 out of the
EU-15 together with Norway and Switzerland which bene…t from free labor
mobility bilateral agreements with the EU), 10 non-EU OECD countries, and
23 LDC countries. The paper utilizes the di¤erence in policy regimes across
EU and non-EU states, distinguishing between DCs and LDCs in order to
test for key di¤erences between free and policy-restricted migration in terms
of the e¤ect of the welfare state on the skill composition of immigrants. We
also control for schooling quality, given the potential bias, since immigrants
with the same years of schooling may vary in their productivity in the labor
market, causing di¤erent …scal burdens. We …nd evidence in support of our
hypothesis that the generosity of the welfare state adversely a¤ects the skillcomposition of migrants under free-migration; but it exerts a more positive
e¤ect under a policy-controlled migration regime relative to a free-migration
regime even after controlling for the di¤erential returns in skills in source and
host countries. Interestingly, these results hold for both DCs and LDCs, but
the e¤ect tends to be larger for DCs. However once we adjust for educational
quality, the e¤ect of welfare-state generosity on skill composition increases for
immigration from LDCs and converges to that experienced by immigration
from DCs.
Our …ndings highlight the importance of controlling for educational quality when studying high skilled migration from LDCs. In addition, it is clear
from our analysis that immigration policies favoring high-skilled migrants do

24

not take into account educational quality. Our …ndings also indicate that
other immigration policies such as family reunion and asylum seekers, also
a¤ect the skill composition of migrants from developing countries.
