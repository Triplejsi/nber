Soft Drink Consumption and Obesity

ABSTRACT
There is insufficient research on the direct effects of food advertising on children's diet and diet-related
health, particularly in non-experimental settings. We employ a nationally-representative sample from
the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey–Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) and the Nielsen Company
data on spot television advertising of cereals, fast food restaurants and soft drinks to children across
the top 55 designated-market areas to estimate the relation between exposure to food advertising on
television and children's food consumption and body weight. Our results suggest that soft drink and
fast food television advertising is associated with increased consumption of soft drinks and fast food
among elementary school children (Grade 5). Exposure to 100 incremental TV ads for sugar-sweetened
carbonated soft drinks during 2002-2004 was associated with a 9.4% rise in children's consumption
of soft drinks in 2004. The same increase in exposure to fast food advertising was associated with
a 1.1% rise in children's consumption of fast food. There was no detectable link between advertising
exposure and average body weight, but fast food advertising was significantly associated with body
mass index for overweight and obese children (>=85th BMI percentile), revealing detectable effects
for a vulnerable group of children. Exposure to advertising for calorie-dense nutrient-poor foods may
increase overall consumption of unhealthy food categories.

1. INTRODUCTION
Public health experts increasingly call for substantial changes in the food environment to
effectively address the epidemic of obesity and poor diet among young people (Frieden et al.,
2010; Goldberg and Gunasti, 2007; Story et al., 2008). Many consider the volume of marketing
for calorie-dense nutrient-poor foods targeted to children and adolescents to be one of the most
pernicious environmental influences on food consumption by youth (Harris et al., 2009a;
Swinburn et al., 2008). A recent White House Task Force on Childhood Obesity Report to the
President highlights the need for additional research to establish the link between advertising and
“food preferences and consumption by children and adolescents” (White House Task Force on
Childhood Obesity, 2010). A substantial body of literature consistently demonstrates that food
marketing increases children’s preferences, requests to parents and choices of advertised brands;
however, far fewer studies have examined effects of food marketing on consumption of food
categories (Hastings et al., 2003; Institute of Medicine, 2006).
Recent research provides indirect evidence that food marketing can have a significant
impact on unhealthy food consumption in children in the short-term (Epstein et al., 2008;
Halford et al., 2004; Halford et al., 2007; Harris et al., 2009b). There is also evidence of longterm effects: television exposure in middle and high school predicts increased consumption of
foods commonly advertised to youth five years later (Barr-Anderson et al., 2009). One study
found that adiposity in children increased with exposure to fast food advertising and that banning
those advertising practices could reduce the incidence of childhood overweight by 18% (Chou et
al., 2008). This is true even though descriptive studies show that exposure to food advertising by
children and adolescents has remained stable and may even slightly declined (Desrochers and
Holt, 2007; Holt et al., 2007; Zywicki et al., 2004). Yet “Holt and colleagues (2007) do not

directly address the postulated link between ad exposure and food consumption or other
behaviors that may be related to obesity” (Desrochers and Holt, 2007, p198), which we explore
in the current analysis. They also do not account for a host of other factors occurring
simultaneously in the time period that may be affecting both changes in advertising and obesity.
As a whole, prior research suggests that food advertising likely has significant negative
effects on young people’s diet, body weight, and health. The 2006 Institute of Medicine (IOM)
report concluded that there was substantial evidence that “food and beverage marketing
influences the preferences and purchase requests of children, influences consumption at least in
the short term, is a likely contributor to less healthful diets, and may contribute to negative dietrelated health outcomes and risks” (p.307). This evidence has motivated public health efforts to
advocate for a significant reduction in child exposure to advertising for energy-dense nutrientpoor foods, including possible government regulation if current self-regulatory industry efforts
do not substantially improve the marketing landscape. Important support for these efforts can be
provided by further direct evidence that food advertising increases consumption of the unhealthy
food categories most commonly promoted to youth. The IOM report goes on to say that “[n]ew
research is needed on food and beverage marketing and its impact on diet and diet-related health
and on improving measurement strategies for factors involved centrally in this research” (p.309).
Our study is designed to contribute to the evidence and test the hypothesis that children’s
exposure to television food advertising is associated with higher consumption of highly
advertised food categories, namely fast food and soft drinks. In doing so, we draw from newer,
more comprehensive data previously unexploited in this area. Using a nationally-representative
sample from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) with food
consumption data on 5th graders and The Nielsen Company (Nielsen) measures of children’s

exposure to food advertising, we estimate associations between exposure to TV advertising and
children’s food consumption and body weight. While we perform several robustness checks to
address the potential endogeneity of advertising, data limitations render it difficult to attribute the
effects found to causal mechanisms. We are therefore careful not to conclude that the
associations provide definitive evidence of causality from advertising exposure to increased food
consumption, but are suggestive of causal effects.

2. METHODS
2.1 Participants
We used data from the ECLS-K, a nationally representative longitudinal study of kindergartners
in 1998-1999 conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics. The children were
followed from kindergarten entry in the fall of 1998 to the spring of the 8th grade (2007) with
five intermediate assessments. The survey collected data from multiple sources, including
children via questionnaires and direct assessment in school, their parents interviewed by phone,
and teachers and school administrators surveyed through questionnaires. The ECLS-K
participants were selected via a multistage probability sampling design and some racial/ethnic
groups were oversampled. More details on the ECLS-K survey design are published elsewhere
(Tourangeau et al., 2009).
The original fall-kindergarten sample included 19,684 participants, but due to sample
attrition (non-response and children moving out of the original schools and not being selected for
follow-up) the spring-fifth grade sample consisted of 12,029 eligible children and 11,820 of them
participated (Tourangeau et al., 2009). We removed respondents missing data for any of the

following measures: body weight or height (N=8201), consumption of fast food and soft drinks
(N=570), residential location (N=830), TV viewing (N=930), socio-demographic characteristics
of the child (N=820), and the child’s mother (N=1100; children could be missing multiple
measures). After these exclusions 9,760 children (82.6% of the original sample) remained
eligible for analysis. Children excluded due to missing data were less likely to be of Asian origin
or live with a married mother and were more likely to live in the South.
Advertising data were merged using geocoded data from the ECLS-K in 2002 (3rd grade)
and 2004 (5th grade). Advertising years 2002 and 2003 were merged with 2002 ECLS-K data,
while advertising year 2004 was merged with 2004 ECLS-K data. In that sense, with the
exception of the possibility that a child moved between 2002 and 2003, advertising exposure is
captured in the designated market area of the child’s residence.

2.2 Measures
2.2.1 Dependent Variables
Food consumption: Children completed a food consumption questionnaire that assessed
consumption of fast food, soft drinks (including fruit and sports drinks; referred throughout by
“soft drinks”), milk, 100% fruit juice, fruit, and vegetables at any venue (home, school,
restaurants). We used fast food and soft drinks due to their large share in children’s diet and
associations with poor nutrition and obesity (Collison et al., 2010).
For soft drinks, children were asked: “During the past 7 days, how many times did you
drink soda pop (EXAMPLES Coke, Pepsi, Mountain Dew), sports drinks (EXAMPLE
Gatorade), or fruit drinks that are not 100% fruit juice (EXAMPLES Kool-Aid, Hi-C, Fruitopia,

restricted-use ECLS-K data.

Fruitworks)?” There were seven answer choices ranging from “I did not drink any during the
past 7 days” to “4 or more times per day.” We converted responses into a count of daily beverage
servings; we used a mid-point for the range responses of “1 to 3 times during the past 7 days”
and “4 to 6 times during the past 7 days” and capped responses to “4 or more times per day” at 4
(Powers and Xie, 2008).2
The fast food consumption question was: “During the past 7 days, about how many times
did you eat a meal or snack from a fast food restaurant such as McDonald’s, Pizza Hut, Burger
King, KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken), Taco Bell, Wendy’s and so on?” with the same seven
answer choices from no intake to “4 or more times per day”. We converted the scale responses to
construct a count of daily fast food meals/snacks consumed using the same approach as for soft
drinks. To adjust for the skewed nature of the distribution of food consumption (Figure 1), we
took the natural logarithm of all consumption measures. A constant was added before taking the
natural logarithm so that no observations were deleted and to allow skewness to be as close to
zero as possible (using the lnskew0 command in Stata 10).
[INSERT FIGURE 1 HERE]
Body weight: Trained examiners took height and weight measurements for the ECLS-K
participants. We used these measures to construct body mass index (BMI) percentiles and zscores according to the CDC growth charts for children’s age and gender (Kuczmarski et al,
2000). BMI z-scores served as our primary measure of child’s body weight status.

2.2.2 Independent Variables

2

We also run models where we cap the top response at 6 drinks per day, since multiplying the top response by 1.5 is
standard in some settings (U.S. Census Bureau, 1993).

Children’s exposure to food advertising on TV: We used Nielsen media data on annual gross
rating points (GRPs) for spot market advertising to children ages 6-11, the best-matched
available age group for our sample of fifth-graders. Specifically, we looked at category-level
advertising of ready-to-eat cereal, regular and dietary carbonated soft drinks (CSDs), and quick
service restaurants (i.e., fast food restaurants). These three categories are important contributors
to children’s diet and also most often marketed to children. Indeed, the average child ages 2 to 11
viewed more than 2,000 television commercials for these categories combined in 2004, 40% of
all food commercials viewed (Harris et al., 2010b). Fast food, CSDs and cereal also accounted
for most of food industry spending on marketing to children ages 6-11 years in 2006, with 26%
of that spending on cereal advertising alone (Federal Trade Commission 2008).
We measure advertising in GRPs, which give the percentage of a specific target audience
reached by advertising for the category of interest in a specific designated market area (DMA)
during a certain time period. For example, an advertising campaign that reaches 80% of a
demographic group during the year on average 100 times will have GRPs of 80*100=8,000 for
that year. Spot market GRPs measure exposure to commercials that occurred only in local
television markets and contrast with national GRPs that measure exposure to network, cable and
syndicated advertising aired across the country. Spot market data allow us to examine differences
in outcomes for children who reside in different geographic areas. Children living in the same
market are assumed to have the same advertising exposure, and our models adjust for individual
TV viewing behavior. We used advertising data for the most densely populated 55 DMAs that
covered on average 70.746% of the total U.S. population according to Nielsen.3

3

Data on 56 DMAs are available, yet only 55 DMAs are available in all three years. These DMAs are listed in
Appendix 1.

The Nielsen data provided annual GRP totals by DMA for the 2002, 2003 and 2004
calendar years.4 During this time period, spot advertising as a proportion of children’s total food
advertising exposure dropped from 13.0% in 2002 to 7.9% in 2004 and continued to decline in
the following years. For packaged food products (excluding restaurants), spot advertising in 2004
represented only 4.5% of children’s exposure, a reduction of 45% from the 2002 level. We chose
to examine the period through 2004 as more recent years would not provide enough variance in
spot market advertising. Our preferred estimation relies on the measures of cumulative exposure
to TV food advertising combining 2002 through 2004 GRPs for each product. The GRP
measures were deflated by 10,000 to ease interpretation of the regression coefficients.

2.2.3 Control Variables
The ECLS-K offers rich data on a wide range of family, school, community, and child
characteristics that affect child development and school performance. We use the following
controls: child’s age in months and its square, race/ethnicity (reported by parents), gender,
mother’s age in years and its square, mother’s marital status, household socio-economic status
(SES), daily number of hours the child spent watching TV, dichotomous variables for low
(<2,500 grams) and high (>=4,000 grams) birth weight (included in BMI regressions only), and
vectors indicating U.S. Census regions.5 All control variables were assessed in 2004 parental
interviews with the exception of the child’s birth weight reported by parents at the kindergarten
baseline.

4

Information on local allocation data, which identify how the national GRP is allocated to each DMA market,
would provide more variation in the advertising exposure at the DMA level. However, we lack access to these data.
5
DMA fixed effects cannot be included in the regression model because the DMA-level advertising measures vary
across DMAs but are constant within each DMA.

2.3 Statistical Analysis
We merged data from the ECLS-K and Nielsen using geographic identifiers in each dataset,
including zip codes from the 2002 ECLS-K for the 2002-2003 advertising data and 2004 ECLSK zip codes for the 2004 advertising data. From the original sample, 89% of children in 2002 and
93% of children in 2004 had valid zip code data. Children missing zip codes had on average
higher BMI, were more likely to be of minority race, lower SES, live in the South, and have
higher fast food intake. For children with available zip code data but living outside of the most
populated 55 DMAs and missing advertising data (N=4,040), we added a dichotomous variable
to indicate their lack of data and tested its significance across models. Compared to children
residing in the top 55 DMAs, these participants were more likely to be from rural areas and of
lower socio-economic status.
We estimated a series of ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions in which logarithmic
scale food consumption measures for fifth-grade children were regressed on children’s exposure
to fast food, CSD and cereal television advertising in the year of the food assessment and two
years prior to it. This postulated relation can be interpreted as the possible effect of increasing
the child’s exposure to TV advertising by 10,000 GRPs on the child’s daily consumption of the
advertised food category. Given that our advertising measure refers to three annual GRP totals
and the outcome is measured on the log scale, the regression coefficient gives a percentage
change in daily food consumption from exposure to an additional 100 food commercials during
three years for the average child.
The set of food consumption models was the following: advertising of CSDs (regular and
diet); advertising of fast food restaurants; advertising of cereal; and three advertising measures
for cereal, CSDs and fast food restaurants in one model. We used cereal advertising as a test of

the robustness of our specification: we would not expect cereal advertising to affect consumption
of soft drinks or fast food. A set of similar models was estimated with BMI z-scores as an
outcome.
The potential endogeneity of advertising may be of concern in this context. This may
particularly be the case with local advertising measures, yet we are compelled to use local
markets since national advertising provides no source of variation at a point in time. Companies
may choose to place their advertisements in areas where demand is already high to capture
market share from other companies perhaps rendering these types of companies somewhat
predatory in nature. Alternatively, they may target areas where demand is low to capture demand
maybe revealing their cooperative nature. At the same time, companies may be cooperative in
areas where demand is high to further increase demand on the intensive margin. If the industry
behavior is predatory, our OLS estimates are likely biased upward. In contrast, our estimates are
conservative if the industry is cooperative. There is evidence that the soft drink industry might be
more cooperative than predatory in nature, which would render them more likely to capture
demand that does not exist rather than capture a competing company’s demand (Gasmi et al.,
1992).
In a similar context, Chou et al. (2008) address this potential endogeneity using
instrumental variables, where the price of an advertisement and the number of households with a
television in the DMA serve as instruments for fast food advertising. These instruments are
found to be valid in that they jointly strongly predict advertising yet are legitimately excludable
from the BMI equation. Hausman tests in this context revealed OLS estimates to be consistent,
and that endogeneity was not problematic.

We rely on the Chou et al. (2008) study in addition to specification checks other than our
cereal advertising falsification check to ensure that our OLS estimates are consistent. The
inclusion of many covariates in our models should also somewhat mitigate this concern. Fixed
effects for US Census regions capture any time-invariant regional characteristics associated with
a company's decision to advertise in a particular region.
Our first check addresses possible omitted variables bias in exploring alternate outcomes
that should not be influenced by any of our advertising measures. For example, we do not expect
fruit and vegetable consumption or physical activity to change detectably as a result of children’s
exposure to soft drink or fast food commercials. These specification checks aid in attributing the
effects we find to advertising and not to spurious correlation.
Our second specification check is to analyze the effect of advertising on consumption
without additional controls. Should companies choose to locate advertisements where demand is
high, we would expect models with no additional controls to yield significant effects that are
high in magnitude. As we show, in no case are our estimates without controls significant, and in
all cases the magnitude of the coefficients is lower than in the models with a full set of controls,
indicating that our reported results may be conservative rather than inflated.6
Our third check is to use only 2004 advertising. To maximize our information on
exposure, we combined advertising data from 2002 to 2004, especially due to the lingering
effects of past advertising on current consumption. Bagwell (2007), however, cites studies
showing that advertising effects depreciate within a year. While this may vary from industry to
industry, it does suggest that the “goodwill effects” of past advertising strongly influencing
current sales may not be the case. We run regressions using only 2004 advertising, as the ECLS-

Results without controls are shown in Appendix 2, in addition to results for regular soft drink and fast food
advertising with BMI as an outcome. Full results are available from the authors upon request.

K children were interviewed in Spring 2004 and prior to being exposed to all 2004
advertisements. While this is not a perfect measure, since 2004 advertising is likely correlated
with 2003 advertising, weaker estimates that are lower in magnitude would suggest that the
potential endogeneity issue is mitigated. Indeed, this is our finding as shown in Appendix 3,
particularly for fast food consumption.
We corrected standard errors for clustering at the DMA-level of our advertising
measures. Cross-sectional child-level weights for parental interview data were applied in all
models. Table 1 defines all variables in the estimation and provides their descriptive statistics.

3. RESULTS
Fifth-graders consumed a mean (SD) of 0.46 (0.75) fast food meals/snacks per day, with higher
intake among low-SES children of 0.71 (1.1) and African-American children of 0.78 (1.1). Some
children reported no consumption of fast food within the last 7 days (27%), but 12% of the
respondents consumed fast food at least daily. Soft drink consumption was on average 0.91
(1.11) servings daily, with 15% of children not drinking them in the last 7 days and 19%
reporting at least 2 daily servings. Children viewed about 2.4 (1.2) hours of television per day
with only 9% children watching TV for less than 1 hour. The average 6- to 11-year-old child in
the top 56 DMAs viewed 297 fast food commercials on spot TV in 2002 (0.81 per day) and 238
(0.65 per day) in 2004 (29,748 and 23,772 GRPs respectively). Local advertising exposure was
less intense for CSDs, 0.17 ads per day in 2002 and 0.10 in 2004.
Table 2 presents results from estimations where child soft drink consumption is the
outcome. As predicted, an increase in TV exposure to sugar-sweetened CSD advertising by
10,000 GRPs over the three-year period (the equivalent of exposure to 100 ads in total or about

33 ads per year) was associated with a 9.4% increase in children’s consumption of soft drinks,
significant at the 1% level (column 1). The elasticity at the mean value of regular CSD
advertising (0.696) implies that a 100% increase in sugar-sweetened CSD advertising was
associated with a 6.5% increase in children’s consumption of soft drinks. The same increase in
exposure to fast food advertising was associated with a smaller soft drink consumption rise of
1.6%, significant at the 5% level (column 3). This positive effect reveals the complementary
nature of soft drinks and fast food. When all three advertising measures (CSDs, fast food, and
cereal) were included, they were jointly significant (p=0.011) (column 5).
Table 3 presents results from estimations where child fast food consumption is the
outcome. An increase in TV exposure to fast food advertising by 10,000 GRPs over the threeyear period was associated with a 1.1% increase in children’s consumption of fast food,
significant at the 10% level (column 3). A significant 7.4% increase is found for a similar
increase in regular CSD advertising, again revealing a strong complementary nature of the two
goods. The elasticities are roughly the same at 0.05. When all three advertising measures (CSDs,
fast food, and cereal) were included, they were jointly significant (p=0.046) (column 5).
For both soft drink and fast food consumption, carbonated soft drink advertising emerges
as a strong and significant predictor of consumption. Multicollinearity across the various
measures of advertising for less healthy products may be an issue, causing the effects of soft
drink advertising to dominate. Moreover, soft drink advertising is likely to be significant due to
the possible nonlinear nature of advertising; since the mean of soft drink advertising is much
lower than that of fast food advertising, the effect is greater at the mean.
As illustrated in Table 4, increments in TV food advertising exposure had no detectable
effects on average body weight as measured by BMI z-scores with the exception of a marginally

significant negative effect for cereal advertising (ß=-0.026; p<0.10) (column 4). However, the
results changed when we isolated the upper tail of the BMI distribution to focus on children with
BMIs at or above the 85th percentile, who were predicted to have significantly higher BMI zscores with incremental exposure to TV fast food advertising. Specifically, a 10,000 GRP
increase in fast food advertising was associated with a 0.01 unit increase in the BMI z-score
(p<0.01), an increase of 1.5% from a mean BMI z-score of 0.668 (column 3). The implied
elasticity for the 85th percentile is 0.065.7 Similar results for fast food advertising can be seen for
the 75th and 95th percentiles of the BMI distribution, albeit less precisely measured (p<0.10).
While fruit, vegetable, and milk consumption can be indirectly affected by advertising of
less healthy foods due to displacement, we did not expect them to shift significantly as a result of
fast food or soft drink advertising. Table 5 documents no significant association between our
advertising measures and fruit and vegetable consumption, and only cereal advertising predicted
lower milk consumption. We found that advertising for fast food was marginally associated with
lower children’s vigorous physical activity, potentially reflecting the positive association of fast
food advertising with BMI for heavier children and their lower engagement in physical activity.
Due to the skewed and categorical nature of our consumption measures, we perform
several robustness checks by employing alternative specifications. These results are presented in
Appendix 4a (for soda consumption as an outcome) and Appendix 4b (for fast food consumption
as an outcome). The first four rows show results from separate regressions, with the standard
control variables included in each model.
The first column of Appendix 4 reports results for 2002-03 advertising (excluding 2004,
the year in which our outcome variables are measured). These results are in general slightly

7

In their study, Chou et al. (2008) find implied BMI elasticities for fast-food restaurant advertising of 0.0157 for 311 year-olds, and 0.0263 for 12-18 year-olds.

stronger than the results in Tables 2 and 3, and thus remain consistent. Column 2 presents probit
results where consumption = 1 if an individual consumed the product daily and 0 otherwise.
(Marginal effects are reported.) The qualitative nature of the results remains the same. Columns
3 and 4 report results for negative binomial and ordered probit models, respectively, using the
original food consumption categories provided in the questionnaire.8 Results again remain robust
to specification. The last column (Column 5) reports results from models using a slightly altered
top category for consumption – 6 rather than 4. These results are qualitatively similar to those
reported in Tables 2 and 3.

4. DISCUSSION
We observed higher consumption of soft drinks and fast food in children with increased
exposure to TV advertising for CSDs and fast food. These findings suggest that children’s
exposure to advertising for calorie-dense nutrient-poor foods is associated with increased overall
consumption of the unhealthy food categories commonly advertised to children. This may
contribute to poor diet in children in the short-term, with potential long-term effects on BMI and
health, especially among the heaviest children.
Additionally, we found an association between CSD advertising and soft drink
consumption regardless of whether we used advertising measures for sugar-sweetened or diet
products or their combination. Recently, beverage companies have increased advertising of their
diet products relative to sugar-sweetened products (Harris et al., 2010a), yet our results suggest it
does not matter. Lack of association in models testing the specification (e.g., cereal advertising

8

Results from Poisson models were very similar to negative binomial models. Negative binomial models are
preferred since tests for equidispersion were rejected, suggesting that Poisson models were inappropriate.

as a predictor of soft drink and fast food consumption) also helps rule out potential spurious
correlation.
The association between exposure to TV food advertising and children’s body weight is
mainly confined to the upper tail of the BMI distribution. Increasing exposure to fast food
advertising on TV is strongly associated with higher BMI z-scores among 5th graders in the
upper tails of the BMI distribution starting at the 75th percentile. The opposite is true for
exposure to cereal advertising, although the negative BMI association may be explained by
breakfast eating behaviors. Cereal consumption predicts the probability that a child eats breakfast
(Albertson et al., 2003; Nicklas et al., 1994), and consuming breakfast is associated with good
health (Siega-Riz et al., 1998).
There have been recent public health initiatives to reduce children’s exposure to
advertising for energy-dense nutrient-poor foods, in particular CSDs and fast food. One such
initiative is the 2006 Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative (CFBAI) (Council of
Better Business Bureaus, 2009). This initiative relies on industry self-regulation to improve the
nutritional quality of foods marketed to children, although recent evaluations of food advertising
to children highlight the limitations of this self-regulatory approach (Harris et al., 2010b; Kunkel
et al., 2009). Since 2004, children’s exposure to CSD advertising has declined by 67% (Harris et
al., 2010b). Powell et al. (2010) also find a marked reduction in exposure to food advertising by
children and adolescents after the CFBAI, reporting reductions in exposure to sweet and
beverage ads between 2003 and 2007. However, they identify increases in exposure to fast food
ads in the same time period. Most major beverage companies belong to the CFBAI, and they
have taken dramatic steps to reduce their television advertising to children. In contrast, exposure
to fast food advertising increased by 21% during the same period. Only two major fast food

advertisers (McDonald’s and Burger King) belong to the CFBAI; and these companies, along
with non-participating fast food advertisers, have instead introduced a few more nutritious
options to their children’s meals, but have continued to advertise their products extensively to
children. More research is needed on the effectiveness of the industry initiatives.
Our findings are subject to limitations. First, survey consumption measures are based on
children’s self-reports, which may underestimate actual intake. We have no details on actual
food consumption and cannot distinguish between diet and regular soft drinks, types of foods
consumed at fast food restaurants, or cereal consumption. Also, lack of association between
advertising and children’s body weight across the BMI distribution may be partly due to BMI
being a stock variable and less stable for children than adults. While the BMI z-score adjusts for
child’s age and gender (by obtaining the z-score within each age/gender cell), growth patterns
differ from child to child, and we do not capture long-run changes in body weight due to the
short time period analyzed. As an example of concerns with using BMI as a measure of child’s
health, obesity was found to be a very poor gauge of high cholesterol in children (Lee et al.,
2009). In adults, fat-free mass, or body composition, is likely a more accurate measure of
adiposity than BMI (Burkhauser and Cawley, 2008; Wada and Tekin, 2010). The primary
contribution of this paper therefore pertains to food consumption and not body mass index.
Although fruit and sports drinks were included in the consumption question for soft
drinks, we do not include advertising for these drinks. Children between the ages of 6 and 11
were exposed to a similar number of ads for fruit drinks and soft drinks in 2003 (Powell et al.,
2010). We are therefore underestimating the exposure to advertising by children.
Our results may be overestimates in the sense that the existence of the advertising does
not equate to its exposure. Yet the results are underestimates in the sense that only spot

advertising is analyzed and children are exposed to food advertising through multiple media
channels. As stated above, soft drink advertising does not include fruit and sports drinks. While it
has been found that exposure to television food advertising has not increased over the 1977-2004
period, children see about 50 percent of television food advertising on children’s programming
(Holt et al., 2007).
Another significant limitation is lack of advertising data for children living outside the
top 55 DMAs (about 44% of our sample) or the possibility that a child moved between 2002 and
2003. Furthermore, while evaluating delayed effects of exposure to advertising in our study
(throughout 2002-2004 and consumption in 2004) could be a concern, there is evidence that
young children’s exposure to commercial television in 1997 affected their BMI in 2002
(Zimmerman and Bell, 2010).
Most importantly, our study establishes associations rather than definitive causal
mechanisms. Although our models carefully control for a host of confounding factors and
include robustness checks to ensure that the effects found are not due to spurious correlation,
causality from advertising to food consumption cannot be inferred using the current data and
methods. Urgently-needed future research in this area should tackle the difficult identification
problem of finding and exploiting exogenous variation in advertising exposure and linking it to
consumption in nationally representative panel data.
In summary, our results provide evidence that children’s exposure to soft drink and fast
food advertising on television is associated with increased consumption of the advertised product
categories. As the overwhelming majority of food commercials viewed by children are for
energy-dense nutrient-poor foods, excessive intake of advertised foods may ultimately present

risk for weight gain. In light of the epidemic of childhood obesity, continuing child exposure to
advertising for nutritionally-poor foods is a serious public health concern.
