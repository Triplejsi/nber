Global Liquidity Trap
Ippei Fujiwara, Tomoyuki Nakajima, Nao Sudo, and Yuki Teranishi
NBER Working Paper No. 16867
March 2011
JEL No. E5,E52
ABSTRACT
In this paper we consider a two-country New Open Economy Macroeconomics model, and analyze
the optimal monetary policy when countries cooperate in the face of a "global liquidity trap" – i.e.,D
situation where the two countries are simultaneously caught in liquidity traps. Compared to the closed
economy case, a notable feature of the optimal policy in the face of a global liquidity trap is its international
dependence. Whether or not a country's nominal interest rate is hitting the zero bound affects the target
inflation rate of the other country. The direction of the effect depends on whether goods produced
in the two countries are Edgeworth complements or substitutes. We also compare several classes of
simple interest-rate rules. Our finding is that targeting the price level yields higher welfare than targeting
the inflation rate, and that it is desirable to let the policy rate of each country respond not only to its
own price level and output gap, but also to those in the other country.

Introduction

The world economy now faces the largest economic downturn since World War II. To prevent further economic deterioration, most central banks in developed economies, including
the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan, have reduced policy interest rates to
unprecedentedly low levels, acting promptly and in unison. The liquidity trap is no longer
an extreme event only for one country, but has become an international concern that needs
to be solved through international monetary cooperation. Figure 1 shows nominal interest
rates from year 2008 to 2009 in several advanced countries. All nominal interest rates
exhibit drastic decreases from their levels in 2008.
In this paper we investigate how monetary authorities of di¤erent countries should
coordinate with each other when they …nd themselves simultaneously caught into a liquidity
traps; that is, how they should coordinate policy measures in the case of a global liquidity
trap. For this purpose, we consider a two-country version of the model of Eggertsson and
Woodford (2003), and study the optimal monetary policy coordination in an environment
where the zero lower bound for the nominal interest rate binds in both countries.
We start by asking under what conditions countries in an open economy separately
might fall into a liquidity trap. We assume producer currency pricing and complete international asset markets. Then, if the nominal interest rate never hits the zero bound,
the optimal policy is given by setting the producer price index (PPI) in‡ation rate to be
zero for each country at all times, as in previous studies such as Clarida, Gali, and Gertler
(2001) and Benigno and Benigno (2003). Under such a policy, the nominal interest rate
in each country is set equal to the real interest rate associated with its own PPI. Thus we
can de…ne the “natural rate of interest” for each country as the PPI-based real interest
rate in the equilibrium with zero PPI in‡ation. The …rst best can be attained as long
as the natural rate of interest de…ned in this way is positive for each country. However,
once a country’s natural rate becomes negative, its nominal interest rate will hit the zero
bound and its economy will fall into a liquidity trap. Thanks to complete international
asset markets, every household in every country has access to the same set of assets at

2

the same prices. Nevertheless monetary authorities in di¤erent countries will face di¤erent real interest rates, because PPIs will vary if countries produce di¤erent goods. This
explains why it is possible for countries to fall separately into liquidity traps even though
international asset markets are complete.
We then show that the optimal monetary policy in the case of a global liquidity trap
exhibits two notable features: history dependence and international dependence. The importance of the history dependence in the conduct of monetary policy during a liquidity
trap has been noted in previous studies on the closed economy.1 The adverse e¤ect of
the liquidity trap can be mitigated if the monetary authority commits to generate some
in‡ation and stimulate production in the future. Such a mechanism is also at work in a
global liquidity trap.
The international dependence of the optimal monetary policy discussed in this paper is
a new feature of interdependence that arises in a global liquidity trap. In open economies,
countries are naturally interrelated through trades in goods and services. In the context
of optimal monetary policy, several aspects of such interdependence across countries have
been analyzed in previous studies such as Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2001) and Benigno
and Benigno (2003). One of our main …ndings is that a global liquidity trap brings about
a new form of interdependence in the optimal monetary policy in open economies. In our
model, if the nominal interest rate never hits the zero bound, the optimal policy could
be implemented by a purely inward-looking in‡ation-targeting policy in which the target
in‡ation rate for each country depends only on its own output gap.2 This is no longer
the case once the possibility that the zero bound binds is taken into account. The target
in‡ation rate for each country necessarily depends on conditions in the other country.
1

Examples on previous work on the closed economy include, among others, Eggertsson and Woodford

(2003), Jung, Teranishi, and Watanabe (2005), and Adam and Billi (2006, 2007). As discussed in Eggertsson
and Woodford (2003), there could be …scal policies to ease the adverse e¤ect of liquidity trap. In the current
paper, however, we focus on the outcomes the monetary policy can bring about taking the …scal policies as
given.
2

This has been shown previously, for instance, by Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2001). In other word, even

if the two countries trade goods each other, international dependence is obtained only in the liquidity trap.

3

In this sense, the global liquidity trap introduces a new form of international dependence
in the optimal monetary policy, which is what we shed light on in this paper. The direction
to which the international dependence works depends on whether goods produced in the
two countries are Edgeworth complements or substitutes. For instance, suppose that they
are substitutes. Then if one country is in a liquidity trap, it exerts downward pressure on
the target in‡ation rate in the other country. In addition, a country pursuing an in‡ationary
policy in order to extricate itself from a liquidity trap will exert upward pressure on the
other country’s in‡ation target. If goods produced in di¤erent countries are complements,
the e¤ects work in opposite directions.
We then examine if the optimal monetary policy can be approximated by a simple
interest-rate rule. For a closed economy where there is no possibility of a liquidity trap,
Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2007) show that the optimal policy is replicated fairly well by
the class of interest-rate rules that respond only to the in‡ation rate. Taking the liquidity
trap into consideration, Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) argue that a simple price-level
targeting policy performs well for the closed economy. Our question here is whether such
a similarly simple monetary policy rule can be identi…ed in our model of a global liquidity
trap. What we …nd, in line with Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), is that an interestrate rule with a price-level target performs much better than the corresponding rule with
an in‡ation target. Furthermore, improved performance is obtained when we allow the
interest-rate rule for each country to depend on the other country’s price level and output
gap. This is because such a rule helps to capture, at least to some extent, the international
dependence that a desirable policy should possess when faced with a global liquidity trap.
The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 discusses the existing literature on
liquidity traps. Section 3 describes our two-country NOEM model and derives the worldloss function. In section 4, we analyze the optimal policy coordination problem, and show
that history and international dependences are crucial features of the optimal policy when
the zero bound may bind. We also present a numerical example, which allows further
investigation into the properties of the optimal policy. Section 5 considers simple interestrate rules, and examines how well they can approximate the optimal policy in the face of

4

a global liquidity trap. Section 6 concludes.

A Brief Survey of the Related Literature

The BOJ’s adoption of what was e¤ectively a zero interest rate policy in the late 1990s
renewed interest in the liquidity trap. For the case of the closed economy, the properties
of the optimal (or at least desirable) monetary policy under such circumstances have been
investigated, for instance, by Reifschneider and Williams (2000), Eggertsson and Woodford
(2003), Jung, Teranishi, and Watanabe (2005), Kato and Nishiyama (2005), Adam and Billi
(2006, 2007), and Nakov (2008).
Reifschneider and Williams (2000) examine how to conduct monetary policy when the
non-negativity condition for the nominal interest rate may bind using the FRBUS model.
In order to mitigate the de‡ationary impact of a liquidity trap, they show that it is desirable
for the monetary authority to commit to maintain a zero interest rate for some periods
even after the adverse shock that triggered the liquidity trap has disappeared. They did
not derive the optimal monetary policy in their model, but later studies show that such
history dependence is indeed one of its important characteristics.
Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) and Jung, Teranishi, and Watanabe (2005) derive
the optimal monetary policy in a standard New Keynesian model. As suggested by Reifschneider and Williams (2000), they show that the optimal policy possesses the historydependence property that the nominal interest rate remains zero for a while even after the
adverse shock itself disappears. The commitment to such a policy ameliorates the de‡ationary pressure in earlier periods where the the adverse shock exists, because it raises the
expected in‡ation rate and lowers the real interest rate. Their models have been extended
to di¤erent stochastic environments by Kato and Nishiyama (2005), Adam and Billi (2006)
and Nakov (2008). The basic message that history dependence is the key feature of the
optimal monetary policy in the face of a liquidity trap is unchanged in these extensions.
Coenen and Wieland (2003), Svensson (2001), and Nakajima (2008) study a liquidity
trap in open economies. Coenen and Wieland (2003) and Svensson (2001) emphasize the
importance of raising the expected rate of in‡ation in an open economy context, and explore
5

its implications for the nominal exchange rate. Nakajima (2008) analyzes the optimal
monetary policy in a two-country version of the model of Eggertsson and Woodford (2003).
These studies, however, restrict attention to a “local liquidity trap,” where there is only
one country in the liquidity trap. The contribution of our paper is to extend the enquiry
to encompass a global liquidity trap, where two countries are simultaneously caught in
liquidity traps.
The optimal policies in the face of, respectively, global and local liquidity traps turn
out to be di¤erent not only during periods when both countries are stuck in liquidity traps,
but also in other periods when one country has successfully escaped. This is because we
are considering the optimal policy commitment. Even in an environment where only one
country remains in a liquidity trap, the optimal policy committed to is di¤erent depending
on whether the commitment was made in a period when both countries were caught in a
liquidity trap, or when one country had already escaped the liquidity trap. In this sense,
the optimal policy problem in the face of a global liquidity trap is a distinct problem, for
which we provide new insights from both analytical and computational viewpoints.

The Model

3.1

Households

The model economy is an open-economy version of the sticky-price model developed by
Woodford (2003), and closely related to the ones considered by Clarida, Gali, and Gertler
(2001), and Benigno and Benigno (2003), among others.
The world economy consists of two countries; the home country (H), and the foreign
country (F ). The size of population in country j 2 fH; F g is nj , where nH + nF = 1. A
set of di¤erentiated products are produced in each country and they are traded between
the two countries. Let Nj denote the set of those products. We assume that NH = [0; nH ],
and NF = (nH ; 1].
In each country identical households reside, who consume di¤erentiated commodities,
supply di¤erentiated labor, and own …rms in their country. Monetary policy is set by the

6

monetary authority in each country. Details of monetary policy are discussed later.

de…ned similarly by individual good prices, pt (i), i 2 Nj , j 2 fH; F g, quoted in the foreign
currency.
We assume that the law of one price holds:
pt (i) = Et pt (i);
for all i 2 Nj , j 2 fH; F g, where Et is the nominal exchange rate, de…ned as the price of
foreign currency in terms of home currency. It follows that Pj;t = Et Pj;t , j = H; F , and
Pt = Et Pt .
3.1.2

Utility maximization

We assume worldwide complete …nancial markets. The ‡ow budget constraint for the home
household is
Pt Ct + Et [Qt;t+1 Wt+1 ] = Wt +

Z

wt (i)`t (i) +

t (i)

di + Tt ;

NH

where Et is the conditional expectation operator, Qt;t+1 is the stochastic discount factor
between dates t and t + 1 for nominal payo¤s in the home country, Wt+1 is the portfolio
of one-period state-contingent bonds, wt (i) is the date-t nominal wage rate for type i 2
NH labor,

t (i)

is the date-t nominal pro…ts from sales of good i 2 NH , and Tt is the

nominal lump-sum transfer from the home government. Given the initial asset holding,
W0 , the home household maximizes its lifetime utility as expressed in equation (1) subject
to equation (5).

8

The ‡ow budget constraint for the foreign household is expressed analogously as:
Z
Et Pt Ct + Et [Qt;t+1 Et+1 Wt+1 ] = Et Wt +
Et wt (i)`t (i) + t (i) di + Tt ;
NF

where Wt+1 is the portfolio of state-contingent bonds in the foreign currency, wt (i) is the
nominal wage rate for type i 2 NF labor,

t (i)

is the nominal pro…t from sales of good

i 2 NF , and Tt is the nominal lump-sum transfer from the foreign government. Given
the initial asset holding W0 , the utility maximization problem for the foreign household is
de…ned as for the home household.

New Keynesian aggregate supply relations

Now suppose that goods prices are adjusted at random intervals as in Calvo (1983). Let
be the probability that each good price remains unchanged in each period. We assume
that this probability is identical in the two countries.
Consider the price adjustment in the home country. Suppose that the price of good
i 2 NH can be adjusted at date t. The supplier of that good chooses pt (i) to maximize its
expected discounted pro…ts:

Real interest rates in open economies

In an economy where a single good is produced and consumed, it is straightforward to de…ne
the real interest rate. If di¤erent commodities are produced and consumed, it becomes less
obvious how to de…ne the real interest rate. In the standard closed-economy New Keynesian
model, a variety of di¤erentiated commodities are produced and consumed, but there is still
no ambiguity in the de…nition of the real interest rate, because every household consumes
the same basket of goods, which also coincides with the basket of goods produced in the
economy. There the CPI-based real interest rate coincides with the PPI-based real interest
rate.
Since the real interest rate is de…ned unambiguously in the closed economy, so is the
“natural rate of interest”: it is de…ned as the real interest rate in the ‡exible-price equilibrium. With sticky prices, to a …rst-order approximation, the in‡ation rate is completely
eliminated if the nominal interest rate, the real interest rate, and the natural rate of interest are all equalized. As discussed by Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), however, if the
natural interest rate becomes negative, the zero lower bound condition for the nominal
interest rate binds in the optimal policy problem, and it is no longer possible to completely
stabilize the in‡ation rate.
The corresponding notions in the open economy framework are less clear, however,
4

As indicated by the quadratic world-welfare loss (19) a là Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), our model

abstracts from the other possible avenue through which de‡ation impairs the economy than price dispersions. Those include debt-de‡ation which may be important during the great recession. If the welfare loss
associated with debt-de‡ation is also considered, the zero lower bound policy could last longer than that
proposed in the current model.

14

even in our speci…cation where representative individuals in the two countries consume
exactly the same basket of goods in equilibrium and both have access to the complete
set of state-contingent claims at the same prices. The reason is that the two countries
produce di¤erent baskets of goods. It follows that each country has a distinct PPI-based
real interest rate, which is also di¤erent from the CPI-based real interest rate. Thus, the
question of which real interest rate should be relevant to the monetary authority is now
non-trivial. Naturally, the answer depends on its chosen objective. Here, the objective of
the monetary authority is to minimize the expected world-welfare loss function (21), and
thus to stabilize the PPI in‡ation rates,

H;t

and

F;t .

It follows that the relevant real

interest rates are the PPI-based rates.

that obtain in equilibrium when prices in both countries are assumed to be ‡exible:

rates in such an equilibrium are equal to the PPI-based natural rates of interest:
n

16

In this sense, our de…nition of the natural rates of interest, equations (22) and (23), is
a natural extension of the one used by Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) for the closed
economy.
The fact that the natural rates of interest relevant to welfare are those based on the PPI
in‡ation rate as in equations (22)-(23) explains why it is possible for the two countries to fall
separately into liquidity traps even though the international asset market is complete. Here,
representative agents in the two countries trade the complete set of state contingent claims
at the same prices. For any given basket of goods, therefore, both the corresponding real
interest rate and the corresponding natural rate of interest are identical for individuals in
di¤erent countries. Thus the situation where just one of the countries is caught in a liquidity
trap does not arise because agents in di¤erent countries face di¤erent real interest rates;
rather, it arises because the two monetary authorities are watching di¤erent real interest
rates and hence di¤erent natural rates of interest. Optimal monetary policy requires the
monetary authority in each country to control the real interest rate based on the PPI; it
does so by choosing a policy interest rate that takes into account the natural rate of interest
de…ned in terms of that country’s PPI, as shown in equations (24)-(25).

Optimal Monetary Policy in the face of a Global Liquidity
Trap

4.1

Optimal Monetary Policy in the face of a Global Liquidity Trap

In this section we analyze the equilibrium when policy is optimal and coordinated with the
optimal policy coordination.6 Speci…cally, suppose that, at some date , the two monetary
authorities coordinate with each other and choose their policies with perfect commitment
6

Existing studies on optimal monetary policy in open economies, such as Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2001)

and Benigno and Benigno (2003), investigate the Nash equilibrium along with the cooperative equilibrium.
In this paper, we focus on the latter equilibrium because the examination of the Nash equilibrium gives a
substantially di¤erent welfare measure.
In the Nash equilibrium, the optimal policy interest rate in the home country is chosen so as to maximize
the utility of representative agents in the home country H given by equation (1). Thus, an optimizer in the
home country no longer considers the welfare of representative agents in the foreign country.

17

in order to achieve an equilibrium that maximizes world welfare. The equilibrium in this
case is obtained by solving the Ramsey problem, that is, by minimizing the world-welfare
loss function (21) subject to the constraints (15), (16), (26), (27), (28), and (29). This
equilibrium is referred to as the Ramsey equilibrium.
Consider …rst the case in which the zero bound conditions for the nominal interest rates,
equations (28) and (29), never bind. Then the Ramsey equilibrium can be implemented
by the following targeting rules:

(31)

These rules are inward looking in the sense that the monetary authority in each country
only needs to look at the in‡ation rate and the output gap in its own country. Thus, as
long as the zero bound conditions for the nominal interest rates do not bind, world welfare
is maximized by a purely inward-looking policy.7 This point has been previously made,
for instance, by Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2001). Note that this inward-looking feature
of the optimal monetary policy does not depend on the value of .
However, the optimal monetary policy can no longer be described by inward-looking
Benigno and Benigno (2003) show that a quadratic measure of welfare includes linear terms for consumption and output. They conclude that the elimination of these linear terms requires the assumption
of perfect price stability through the game theoretic strategies of the two central banks. In the face of a
liquidity trap, however, perfect price stability cannot be attained. The linear term in the welfare measure
makes the optimal monetary policy analysis impossible.
Alternatively, Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2001) propose treating the foreign variables as given constants.
This allows the following form of loss function to be derived:

While this quadratic measure of the welfare loss contains only home variables, comparison between the
Nash equilibrium and the cooperative equilibrium involves a new di¢ culty because the sum of the quadratic
measures of welfare loss in the two countries does not coincide with equation (19).
7

Our assumption of producer currency pricing is also crucial for this result. As shown by Devereux and

Engel (2003), under local currency pricing, the optimal monetary policy aims at stabilizing the nominal
exchange rate and therefore takes foreign variables into consideration. Investigation of the optimal monetary
policy under local currency pricing is left for our future research.

rules if the zero lower bound conditions bind with a positive probability. Even with the
producer currency pricing, foreign variables must be included in the domestic targeting
rule. The degree of in‡uence from foreign variables is determined by
Lagrange multipliers associated with inequalities (28) and (29) by

Comparing the targeting rules (30)-(31) and (32)-(33), we see that when the zero bound

how zH and zF respond to a one-time increase in

for di¤erent values of

rule for the home country is a¤ected when the home country falls into a liquidity trap in
period 1. In the period that the zero bound binds, the monetary authority has to allow for
de‡ation and a negative output gap, so that the targeting rule shifts downward: zH;1 < 0.
However, such a downward shift in the targeting rule is alleviated by promising an upward

The parameter values used to plot the …gure are summarized in Table 1, which is discussed in Section

4.2.

shift in the targeting rule in the future, zH;2 > 0. In other words, a country caught in a
liquidity trap can reduce the damage it sustains if the monetary authority commits itself
to generating some in‡ation and positive output gaps in the future. This feature of the
optimal monetary policy is the history dependence that is emphasized in previous studies
on the closed economy, such as Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) and Jung, Teranishi, and
Watanabe (2005).
The possibility of a global liquidity trap adds an additional feature to the optimal
policy: international dependence. Mathematically, such interdependence can be seen by
the fact that the country-speci…c Lagrange multipliers on the zero bound constraints,
and

F;t ,

each a¤ect both zH;t and zF;t as shown in equation (34) provided that

For instance, if the home country is in a liquidity trap in period t, then

> 0; this will

a¤ect not only the home country’s targeting rule (32), but also the foreign country’s rule
(33) through its in‡uence on zH;t and zF;t . The optimal rate of in‡ation for each country
is a¤ected by whether or not the other country is caught in a liquidity trap. Economic
e¢ ciency is no longer attained simply by ‘keeping one’s house in order.’
The lower panel of Figure 2 shows how a liquidity trap in the home country a¤ects
the optimal targeting rule for the foreign country. The direction of the e¤ect depends
on whether

is greater or less than unity. This follows from the fact that the source

of the international dependence in our model is the dependence of the marginal utility
from consuming the composite good produced in one country on the consumption of the
composite good produced in the other country. When

> 1, however, home goods and

foreign goods are Edgeworth substitutes, i.e., uHF = uF H < 0. The marginal utility of
the consumption of the composite good produced in one country is a¤ected in the same
direction by the consumption of the composite good produced in either country, becasue
uHH < 0 and uF F < 0. Thus, in this case, a shift of the optimal targeting rule in one
country is transmitted into a shift of the optimal targeting rule in the other country in the

It is clear from equation (34) that if

only a¤ects zj for each j = H; F . Thus, the targeting

rules (32)-(33) do not exhibit the form of international dependence discussed here. In what follows, whenever
we emphasize the international dependence of the optimal monetary policy, we are implicitly assuming that

direction when

= 2. To the contrary, when

a¤ects zF;t and zH;t in the same

H;t

< 1, home goods and foreign goods are

Edgeworth complements: uHF = uF H > 0. Thus, the marginal utility of the consumption
of goods produced in each country is a¤ected in the opposite directions by the consumption
of goods produced in the two countries. As a result, the optimal targeting rule in the two
countries shift in the opposite directions. This is consistent with the …gure in the case of
= 0:5.
A further insight into how monetary policy should be conducted in a global liquidity
trap is obtained by looking at the dynamic IS curves (26)-(27) with the zero bound conditions (28)-(29). First, suppose that the natural rate of interest associated with the home
n
good is negative in period t0 , rH;t
< 0, so that the home country is in a liquidity trap:
0

0 = iH;t0 = rH;t0 + Et0

H;t0 +1 ;

where rH;t0 denotes the real interest rate associated with the home good as de…ned in
equation (24).
The optimal policy attempts to relax the degree to which the zero constraint binds.
There are several ways to do this. One way is for the monetary authority in the home
country to commit to future stimulation of the home economy once the natural rate returns
to a positive level. Such a commitment makes Et0

H;t0 +1

> 0 and Et0 (xH;t0 +1

xH;t0 ) > 0.

Both of these would o¤set at least partially the depressing e¤ect of the negative shock
to the home natural rate. Additionally, if the foreign monetary authority also commits to
achieve (

1)Et0 (xF;t0 +1

be relaxed further. Thus, if

xF;t0 ) > 0, then the zero constraint for the home country would
> 1 (respectively, if

< 1), a future expansion (contraction)

of the foreign economy helps alleviate the severity of the current liquidity trap for the home
economy. In this way, policy commitment by each of the two monetary authorities acts to
reduce the welfare loss associated with the home country’s liquidity trap.
Next suppose that the natural rate in the home country returns to a positive level in
period t1 > t0 . The IS curve for the foreign country is
iF;t1 = rF;t1 + Et1
21

F;t1 +1 ;

where rF;t1 denotes the real interest rate associated with the foreign good de…ned in (25).
Given the home monetary authority’s policy commitment, the home economy experiences
a temporary boom in period t1 , xH;t1 > 0, which implies that Et1 (xH;t1 +1
From the perspective of the foreign monetary authority, if

xH;t1 ) < 0.

> 1 ( < 1) this constitutes

a negative (positive) shock to the real interest rate rF;t1 . Thus, for

> 1 (for

< 1),

the foreign monetary authority tends to lower (raise) iF;t when the home natural rate,
rH;t , becomes positive. Notice also that such a response by the foreign monetary authority
tends to raise (lower) xF;t1 when

> 1 ( < 1); this is consistent with the foreign monetary

authority’s commitment to generate (

1)Et0 (xF;t0 +1

xF;t0 ) > 0 during periods when

the home country is in the liquidity trap.

4.2

Numerical example

In order to further analyze the properties of the optimal policy, let us consider a numerical
example, which extends the closed-economy experiment of Eggertsson and Woodford (2003)
to our open-economy environment. The parameters assumed here are summarized in Table
1. Suppose that in the initial period t = 0, the world economy is in the steady state where
the natural rate is rn =
H

F

, and the in‡ation rates and the output gaps are all zero:

= xH = xF = 0. Then, in period t = 1, the natural rates of interest in both

countries drop unexpectedly to a negative level rn < 0. These negative natural rate shocks
are temporary, and we assume that the natural rates evolve according to the following

determines the maximal number of periods for which a country’s natural rate may remain

each of which is

adapted to the …ltration generated by the stopping times (TH ; TF ). The optimal monetary
policy chooses this set of stochastic processes so as to solve the Ramsey problem described in
the previous subsection. The details of the numerical algorithm are given in the Appendix.
In what follows, we examine equilibrium paths under the optimal policy associated with
particular realizations of the stopping times (TH ; TF ).
Let us begin with the symmetric case: TH = TF , that is, the case in which the natural
rates of both economies return to the normal level r in the same period. Figure 3 plots
the paths of the nominal interest rates iH;t and iF;t , the in‡ation rates

H;t

and

F;t ,

and

n and r n
the output gaps xH;t and xF;t for the case of TH = TF = 15 (that is, both rH;t
F;t

become positive again when t = 16). It is clear that the optimal policy exhibits the kind
of history dependence discussed in the previous subsection. The nominal interest rate in
each country remains set to zero for two more periods (t = 16; 17) after its natural rate
becomes positive. Correspondingly, the in‡ation rate and the output gap in each country
become positive in period 16. As discussed in the previous subsection, such a commitment
alleviates the contractionary e¤ects from negative natural rates r in earlier periods. With
the symmetric realization of the shocks, however, it is di¢ cult to tell the extent to which
the optimal policy shows international dependence. It is more easily seen for cases when
the realizations of the shocks are asymmetric.
n
n
Figure 4 depicts the case where TH = 15 and TF = 10 (that is, where rH;t
and rF;t

return to r when t = 16 and t = 11, respectively). Again, the history dependence is
evident: the nominal interest rate in each country remains set to zero for a while even
after its natural rate returns to normal; and in each economy both in‡ation rate and
output gap are positive in the period its natural rate shifts from rn to rn . Furthermore,

23

the international dependence of the optimal policy can also be clearly seen. For instance,
look at what happens to the foreign country’s nominal interest rate iF;t after the home
country’s natural rate returns to rn (i.e., t = 16; 17). The home country’s output gap
increases temporarily in period 16, as a result of which its expected growth rate from t to
t + 1 is negative for t = 16; 17. Given that our example has

= 2, the negative growth

n de…ned in
of the home output gap works as a negative shock on the real interest rate rF;t

equation (25). This is why the foreign nominal interest rate iF;t declines for the periods
t = 16; 17. Analogously, the negative expected growth rate implied by the foreign output
gap in the period when the foreign natural rate returns to rn (t = 11) acts as a negative
shock on the real interest rate rH;t de…ned in equation (24). In that period, however,
the home country is still caught in a liquidity trap and the home nominal interest rate
cannot be lowered further. Instead, the e¤ect of this negative shock on rH;t is mostly seen
in the shape of a decline in the home output gap in period 11. Yet another form of the
international dependence appears in the term Et (xF;t+1
t

xF;t ) in equation (24) for periods

n returns to r n in period 11, the foreign output gap rises at …rst, and then
TH . When rF;t

declines for a few periods (t = 12; 13 in Figure 3). After this, the foreign output gap starts
to increase gradually (for t = 14; 15; 16 in the …gure). Although quantitatively small, this
behavior of the foreign output gap for t = 14; 15; 16 is enough to yield Et (xF;t+1

xF;t ) > 0

during those periods, which helps to alleviate the severity of the liquidity trap that the
home country is caught in.
Variation in the Ramsey equilibrium path across di¤erent realizations of the shocks is
illustrated in Figure 5. There, the paths of the nominal interest rates under the optimal
policy are plotted for the cases where TF = 10 but TH varies from 12 to 17. These paths
are interpreted in the same way as in the previous …gure: The optimal policy is seen to be
characterized primarily by international dependence and history dependence.
The next two …gures demonstrate how the Ramsey equilibrium depends on the probabilities of the natural rates returning to normal, p and q. In Figure 6, we continue to
assume that p = q as in the previous …gures, but allow the value to vary. Speci…cally,
we plot the paths of the nominal interest rates under the optimal policy when TH = 15

and TF = 10 and it is assumed that p = q 2 f0:15; 0:2; 0:25; 0:3g. It can be seen that, as
probabilities p and q get smaller, the history dependence e¤ect becomes more marked: that
is, the optimal monetary policy requires commitment to a lower interest rate for longer
periods. The international dependence e¤ect is also magni…ed by a smaller value of p and
q (notice the larger drop in iF;t after t = 16). This is because a larger degree of history
dependence ampli…es the boom in a country when its natural rate returns to normal, and
this in turn increases the impact on the real interest rate in the other country.
In Figure 7, we consider the case of asymmetric probabilities: p 6= q. We …x q = 0:25
and let p vary from 0.2 to 0.275. To focus on the asymmetry of the probabilities, we look
at the equilibrium path for a symmetric realization of the shocks, TH = TF = 10. The
…gure demonstrates that a lower value of p leads to a larger degree of history dependence
in the home monetary policy and also a larger degree of international dependence from the
perspective of the foreign monetary policy.

Simple Monetary-Policy Rules

In this section we examine the extent to which the optimal monetary policy can be approximated by a “simple”interest-rate rule. In the case of a closed economy with no possibility
of falling into a liquidity trap, Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2007) show that the optimal
policy is replicated fairly well by the class of interest-rate rules that respond only to the
in‡ation rate. In the liquidity trap case, Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) argue that a
simple price-level targeting policy performs well for the closed economy. Our question is
whether a similarly simple such monetary policy rule can be identi…ed for our model of a
global liquidity trap. For this purpose, we restrict attention to classes of simple interestrate rules where nominal interest rates respond to some combination of in‡ation rates, price
levels, output gaps, and nominal exchange rates. We will see that a simple interest-rate
rule that includes both the foreign price level and the output gap in addition to those of
the home country can improve welfare. Among the various rules we consider, this is the
one that best captures the key features of the optimal monetary policy analyzed in the
previous section.
25

We start with the case where the nominal interest rate in each country is set to respond
only to domestic variables. Speci…cally, consider the following two classes of interest rate
rule: the interest rate rule with in‡ation targets:
~{H;t =

(

~{F;t =

H;t )

H;t
F;t

F;t

+
+

x xH;t
x xF;t

+ r;
(36)

+ r;

and the interest rate rule with price-level targets:
~{H;t =
~{F;t =

p

ln PH;t

p

ln PF;t

ln P H;t +
ln P F;t +

x xH;t

+ r;

x xF;t

+ r:

(37)

In what follows we assume that the target in‡ation rates in the interest-rate rules (36) are
zero:

H;t

=

F;t

= 0; and that the target price levels in the interest-rate rules (37) are

the date-0 price levels: P H;t = PH;0 and P F;t = PF;0 . Due to the zero bound on nominal
interest rates, the actual rates set by the monetary authorities are
iH;t = maxf~{H;t ; 0g;

and

iF;t = maxf~{F;t ; 0g:

n and r n , follow the stochastic process described in
Given that the natural rates, rH;t

the previous section, we compare the expected world-welfare loss (21) evaluated in period
1 under alternative policy rules. For the interest-rate rules (36)-(37), we restrict the policy
parameters so that 1:1

5, 0

x

5, and 1:1

p

5.10 Furthermore,

this parameter space is discretized with a grid size of 0.5, when searching for the optimal
parameter con…guration.
Table 2 shows the optimal con…guration of parameters for each class of interest-rate
rules and the associated world-welfare losses (21). They are normalized by the worldwelfare loss for the optimal monetary policy. In the table, the label “ITR” denotes the
interest-rate rule with in‡ation targets and “PLTR” denotes the interest-rate rule with
price-level targets.
The second row of Table 2 shows that the best in‡ation-targeting rule puts a zero
weight on the output gap. This is similar to what Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2007) …nd in
10

This restriction acts to guarantee determinacy.

26

a closed-economy model without a liquidity trap. The fourth row indicates that a pricelevel targeting rule ought also to place some weight on the output gap. For comparison, the
…rst and third rows of Table 2 provide the world-welfare losses under some conventional
parameter con…gurations: speci…cally,
with in‡ation targets, and

p

= 1:5 and

= 1:5 and
x

x

= 0:5 for the interest-rate rule

= 0:5 for the interest-rate rule with price-level

targets.
In terms of welfare, the interest-rate rule with price-level targets performs far better
than the in‡ation-targeting rule, as is shown in the fourth row of Table 2. The reason is
that the in‡ation-targeting rule does not provide any history dependence, a key element in
mitigating the severity of a liquidity trap. In contrast, with price-level targets, the nominal
interest rate in each country is gradually adjusted to its steady-state level after the natural
rate regains its steady-state value. This enables it to generate history dependence. This
property of the policy with price-level targets is in line with the …ndings of Eggertsson and
Woodford (2003) for the closed economy model with a liquidity trap.
Now let us look at the case where the home country adopts an interest-rate rule with
in‡ation targets but the foreign country adopts an interest-rate rule with price-level targets.11 The …fth row of Table 2 shows the substantial deterioration in world welfare in this
case compared to when both countries adopt an interest-rate rule with price-level targets.
The clear implication is that the two monetary authorities should jointly commit to an
interest-rate rule with price-level targets when faced with a global liquidity trap. A single
country’s commitment to a history dependent policy is not enough.
We next examine if including foreign variables in the domestic policy rule improves
welfare. For this purpose, we augment the interest-rate rule with price-level targets with
foreign variables as follows:
~{H;t =
~{F;t =
11

p

ln PH;t

ln P H +

p

ln PF;t

ln P F +

pa

ln PF;t

ln P F +

x xH;t

+

pa

ln PH;t

ln P H +

x xF;t +

xa xF;t

+ r;
(38)

xa xH;t + r;

This may be viewed as a situation where one country commits to its policy but in the other policy

remains discretionary. For the de…nition of discretionary policy in a liquidity trap, see Jung, Teranishi, and
Watanabe (2005).

5. Following

these rules, a country lowers its policy rate when the other country experiences a downturn,
i.e., a negative output gap and a price level lower than the target level. Thus, these rules
capture international dependence. The sixth row of Table 2 shows how augmenting the
policy rule in this way improves welfare.
We can interpret the augmented rules (38) in terms of the nominal exchange rate. Note
that it follows from the household’s …rst-order conditions (10) that the nominal exchange
rate Et satis…es
Et =

PH;t nF YH;t
:
PF;t nH YF;t

De…ne the log deviation of the nominal exchange rate, Etn , as
Etn =
and let

t

n
P H nF YH;t
n ;
P F nH YF;t

denote the exchange rate gap, i.e.,
t

ln P H

= ln PH;t

t

ln Et

ln Etn . It follows that

ln P F + xH;t

ln PF;t

xF;t :

Given this, we can rewrite equations (38) as
~{H;t =

~{F;t =

is a positive parameter. Thus, the welfare gain from augmenting the rule can be

interpreted as the bene…t of letting the policy rate respond to the nominal exchange rate.
This helps the policy rule to capture the features of desirable policy in a global liquidity
trap, namely, history dependence and international dependence.12
12

Here, since both of the two countries are under the liquidity trap, the exchange rate peg to another

country’s currency for escaping from a liquidity trap, so called foolproof way in Svensson (2001), is not
relevant policy. Consequently, two central banks create in‡ation expectation by the commitment to the
zero interest rate. Alternatively, if one country is out of a liquidity trap, then foolproof way could work as
shown in Coenen and Wieland (2003).

Concluding Remarks

In this paper we consider a two-country New Open Economy Macroeconomics model, and
analyze the optimal monetary policy when monetary authorities cooperate in the face of a
global liquidity trap — that is, a situation where both countries are caught simultaneously
in liquidity traps. Compared to the closed economy case, the most notable feature of the
optimal policy in the global liquidity trap is its international dependence. Whether or not
a country’s nominal interest rate is hitting the zero bound a¤ects the target in‡ation rate
in the other country. The direction of the e¤ect depends on whether goods produced in the
two countries are Edgeworth complements or substitutes. We also compare several classes
of simple interest-rate rules. Our …nding is that targeting the price level yields higher
welfare than targeting the in‡ation rate, and that it is desirable to let the policy rate of
each country respond not only to its own price level and output gap, but also to those in
the other country.
The model considered in this paper is of course very stylized, and the robustness of
our …ndings needs to be tested under alternative assumptions. For instance, our current
analysis is restricted to the case where the monetary authorities in the two countries coordinate their monetary policy choices with each other so as to maximize world welfare. An
alternative assumption would be that the monetary authorities set their respective policies
in a non-cooperative way. Another extension of potential interest would be to consider how
the results would be a¤ected if we adopted local currency pricing, rather than producer
currency pricing as at present. In addition, while the current paper focuses on the interest
rate policy, incorporating other possible policy measures, such as quantitative easing and
credit easing, is also important. These extensions are left for future research.

A

Welfare approximation

Here we follow Woodford (2003) and Benigno and Woodford (2005) to derive an approximate world welfare criterion. We assume that the monetary authorities in the two countries
cooperate to maximize aggregate utility.
Given that preferences of the home and foreign household are given by equations (1)
and (4), respectively, the level of average expected utility between the two countries is
given by
nH U0 + nF U0 = E0

Numerical Algorithm for Stochastic Simulation

Suppose that the natural rates of the two countries follows the stochastic process as described in the main text, and consider the Ramsey problem in period

= 1 of mini-

mizing the world welfare function (21) subject to the constraints (15), (16), (26), (27),
(28), and (29). Let

be the multiplier associated with constraints (26), (27), (28), and (29).

Then the Lagrangian for the Ramsey problem can be formed as:

In principle, it is possible to have other phases, for instance, the one where rH

our parameter con…guration, however, we have con…rmed in our numerical solution that these nine phases
are the only possible ones that occur in the Ramsey equilibrium.

of periods in which phases (1,2) and (2,1) occur given realized values of TF and TH , respectively. Similarly, let k2;2 (TH ; TF ), k2;3 (TH ; TF ), and k3;2 (TH ; TF ) denote the number
of periods in which phases (2,2), (2,3), and (3,2) occur given realized values of TH and
TF , respectively. Here, k1;2 (TF ), k2;1 (TH ), k2;2 (TH ; TF ), k2;3 (TH ; TF ), and k3;2 (TH ; TF )
are all non-negative integers. Our numerical algorithm is to …nd a collection of functions

shocks in the two countries last until TH = TF = 10. Figure A2 displays the time paths
of nominal interest rates, in‡ation rates, and output gaps in the two countries when a
shock to natural rate of interest lasts longer in the domestic than in the foreign country at
TH = 15 and TF = 10. We can see that the case with deterministic shocks are similar to
the case with stochastic shocks.
