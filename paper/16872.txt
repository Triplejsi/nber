Introduction
Business failures have long been recognized as indicators of economic trends.1 Failures
rise during recessions. Failures fall during expansions. Knowledge of these trends enables
businessmen to make better decisions. So, business-information agencies began publishing data
on the issue in the middle of the nineteenth century. The United States Commerce Department
began publishing a series soon thereafter.2 The principal source for information about business
failures during the late 19th and early 20th centuries was R. G. Dun and Company, which
gathered the information from court filings nationwide. From the 1850s to the 1890s, Dun
published information about bankruptcies in various venues and forms. In 1896, Dun began
publishing monthly data on business failures cross tabulated by branch of business, which the
company asserted, was obviously “of the highest interest and importance to the business world”
because the data showed in what directions misfortune had occurred in and which direction
“misfortune was to be expected.”3 Dun was the first firm to do so. Dun continued publishing this
series until the 1930s. The series has, however, lain dormant since Dun discontinued it in 1936.
This article resurrects that series, entitled “Business Failures by Branch of Business.” The
authors reconstruct it by examining every issue of Dun’s Review (plus related and successor
publications) published between 1895 and 1940. The reconstruction requires the authors to fill
gaps in the series and link the series to its successor, “Business Failures by Division of Industry.”
Scholars have worked with this data before, but none of the extant series provides the
same length, breadth, and depth of information provided in this paper. The Historical Statistics of

The National Bureau of Economic Research recognized total liabilities of failed firms as a leading indicator of
economic activity soon after the Bureau began dating business cycles (Simpson and Anderson 1957, p. 193).
The Statistical Abstract of the United States for 1891 included data on commercial failures by state for the years
1889, 1890, and 1891 and for the U.S. as a whole back to 1879. The Statistical Abstract for 1899 extended the
U.S. series back to 1876. The information that it published came from R.G. Dun and Company.
Dun’s Review, 5 June 1897, p. 2.

the United States, for example, contains series on bankruptcies derived from Dun’s data (Sutch
2006). “Table Ch408-41: Business incorporations and failures–number and liabilities: 1857–
1998” indicates annual figures for the liabilities of failed firms, number of failed firms, number
of failures per 10,000 active firms, number of active firms, and number of new incorporations.
Beginning with the 1924 edition, the Statistical Abstract of the United States contains similar
information. The table “Commercial Failures: Number and Liabilities” indicates the number and
liabilities of failed firms each year beginning in 1857 and monthly beginning in 1918. Beginning
with the Biennial Supplement in 1936, the Survey of Current Business contains more detailed
data. The table “Finance: Commercial Failures” indicates the number and liability of failures by
month for most economic sectors (manufacturing, trading, etc.) and for many divisions of
manufacturing (definitions appear in the next section), but does not indicate how this data relates
to data available for earlier periods and fails to indicate the changing definitions of divisions of
industry before 1936. This essay presents data on business failures at the lowest level of
aggregation, topically and chronologically, from the origins of the series around 1895 until the
end of the depression in 1939.
During the 1890s, when the series began, a business failure was defined as a concern
which was involved in a court proceeding or voluntary action which was likely to end in loss to
creditors. Personal bankruptcies of individuals such as doctors, dentists, and lawyers were
excluded. Liabilities of failed businesses were defined “as all liabilities except long-term
publicly-held obligations, chiefly bonds.” The exclusions were comparatively small, averaging
about one percent of current liabilities for businesses that went bankrupt.4
These definitions arose from the nature of bankruptcy during the nineteenth century. The
United States’ constitution (Article 1, Section 8, Clause 4) provided Congress with the power to
4

create “uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States.” Congress
exercised this authority several times since the foundation of the nation. In 1800, Congress
passed the first Bankruptcy Act, which it repealed in 1803. In 1841, Congress passed the second
Bankruptcy Act, which it repealed in 1843. In 1867, Congress passed the third Bankruptcy Act,
which it amended in 1874 and repealed in 1878.
The Bankruptcy Act of 1898 formed the foundation for the modern law of bankruptcy.
The act covered all corporations, except railroads; municipalities; other public entities; and
insurance, banking, and building-and-loan corporations, all of which remained under state
jurisdiction. The act allowed three creditors with claims totaling $1,000 to file in federal court a
petition alleging that a firm had not met its obligations or could not in the future meet its
obligations as they matured. The court appointed a receiver who determined whether the
corporation was insolvent, and if it was insolvent, seized its assets, sold them at auction, and
repaid creditors with the funds recovered.
This straightforward process worked well in many cases, but the procedure was
imperfect. The seizure and sale of assets disrupted the operations of corporations, and often
proved destructive to the interests of debtors and creditors alike. The procedure inhibited the
reorganization of corporations with the potential to be profitable, because creditors had to
unanimously consent to a reorganization plan. A sole creditor could prevent reorganization. Any
three creditors could compel liquidation.
In 1934, Congress amended the Bankruptcy Act of 1898. The amendments established
new procedures for restructuring corporate debts. The act covered all corporations already under
the jurisdiction of federal bankruptcy courts and added railroads engaged in interstate commerce.
Section 77 of the Act pertained to railroads. Section 77B pertained to all other organizations

3

currently under the jurisdiction of federal bankruptcy law. Section 77B was born of a demand for
a method of reorganization more open, fair, and efficient than equity receivership yet still under
the supervision of a bankruptcy court. The Solicitor General of the United States stated that
Section 77B was
“designed to replace the cumbersome, expensive, and dilatory equity
receivership proceedings under which corporations were compelled to reorganize
prior to the enactment of this law, and to permit corporations on their own
initiative or that of creditors and stockholders to effect a reduction of fixed
charges and to scale down and excessive debt structure so that the corporation
may continue its operations on a profitable basis.”5
The new law allowed a corporation to file a petition declaring that it was unable to meet its debts
and desired to reorganize. A federal district judge received the petition. If he determined that it
was filed in good faith and accepted the petition, the court acquired jurisdiction over the debtor
and all of its property wherever located, even if the company was currently under court
supervision, in the hands of a receiver, and undergoing liquidation. The court could appoint
trustees or leave corporate management in place and give them authority to continue operating
the firm. The court divided creditors into classes, depending on the nature of their claims against
the corporation, such as bond holders, stockholders, and unsecured creditors. Two-thirds of each
class (by value) had to approve a plan for reorganization. The corporation proposed a
reorganization plan. Creditors could submit competing plans. A plan was implemented if the
court found it fair and equitable and if two thirds of each class of creditor (e.g. bondholders,
stockholders, and unsecured creditors) agreed to it in writing. Satisfactory plans frequently
involved “the formation of a new corporation and the exchange of new stock and securities for

old. In such transfers, bondholders often consent[ed] to become unsecured by the exchange of
their bonds for debentures or stock. Stockholders may have lo[st] their equity entirely.”6
Section 77B altered the nature of bankruptcy, and obviously, statistics on bankrupt
businesses. This essay captures that important change by continuing the series on failures
through the 1930s, using the old definition of failure, which indicates the number of firms facing
court proceedings under the rules established in 1898. This essay also establishes a new series,
entitled business reorganizations under Section 77B, which indicates the number of firms
reorganizing under the rules established in 1934.
The remainder of this essay completes that task. Section 2 describes the sources of data.
Section 3 describes the methods that we use to complete and splice the series. Section 4
describes patterns apparent in the data. Section 5 discusses the implications of our analysis and
potential uses of this new series.

2. Data Sources and Definitions
R. G. Dun and Company (and its predecessor) published information about business
failures beginning about the time of the Civil War. In 1896, Dun began publishing monthly
figures for failures cross-tabulated by branch of business. Dun’s agents gathered this information
by collecting records of judicial filings from courthouses in municipalities throughout the United
States. Each month, agents forwarded the data to Dun’s national office. Dun’s tabulated the
statistics and published it the following month.
Dun’s Review was published weekly from August 5, 1893 (volume 1, number 1) until
February 25, 1933 (volume 41, no. 2057). In March 1933, R. G. Dun and Company merged with
its principal competitor, the Bradstreet Company. The new company, Dun and Bradstreet’s,

5

merged their competing publications, Dun’s Review and Bradstreet's Weekly, to form Dun and
Bradstreet Weekly Review. Three issues of Dun and Bradstreet’s Weekly Review appeared
(numbers 2058 to 2060 on March 4, 11, and 18). Then, the company reduced the frequency of
publication and changed the title to Dun and Bradstreet's Monthly Review. In February 1937, the
title changed again, to Dun’s Review, and stayed that way for 17 years.7
Appendix 1 indicates volumes of Dun’s Review (and its predecessors and successors)
containing data about bankruptcies disaggregated by branch of business. The data initially
appeared in February 1896. The initial issue contained data from January 1895 and 1896. Issues
from the remainder of the year reviewed events from March 1894 through November 1896. The
January 1897 issue contained data on the previous December as well as the entire years 1894
though 1896. The issued attributed the availability of this data to unspecified evidentiary
advances. “This year,” the Review stated, “we have for the first time such records as to located
trade failures not merely by quarters but by months.” The January issue established the pattern of
publication. Data for one month appeared during the next. Quarterly tabulations appeared four
times each year. Annual tabulations appeared in the January of the following year.8
Information tabulated by branches of industry appeared consistently for nearly forty
years. From February 1895 to September 1906, Dun’s Review reported the number and liabilities
of failures in 26 branches of business. From October 1906 to March 1936, Dun’s Review
reported the number and liabilities of failures in 28 branches of business. The increase occurred
when Dun split the category “Manufacturing: Chemicals, Drugs, and Paints,” into

http://www.loc.gov/rr/business/duns/duns15m.html. Note that from 1937 to 1940, Dun’s Statistical Review provides
extensive coverage of data on business failures, including summaries and revisions of all data back to 1934.

Dun’s Review reported information about bankruptcies in several tables. One typically examined the pattern of
bankruptcies at the aggregate level over recent years. Another examined bankruptcies of large and small firms.
Others disaggregated the data by region, state, and Federal Reserve district. In later papers, we construct consistent
time-series based on these tables.

“Manufacturing: Chemicals and Drugs” and “Manufacturing: Paints and Oils” and split the
category “Retail Trade: Drugs and Paints,” into “Retail Trade: Chemicals and Drugs” and “Retail
Trade: Paints and Oils.”
Dun’s Review defined the branches of business in each edition. The general definition of
a branch was a group of firms producing or trading merchandise which was “more and less
kindred or mutually dependent.” The specific definitions consisted of a sector name, a branch
title, and information regarding related industries included in the classification. Branches were
grouped into three sectors. Manufacturers made goods. Traders sold goods that they did not
manufacture. Companies appeared in the category “brokers and traders” also known as “other” if
they neither manufactured merchandise nor sold merchandise made by others, but instead bought
and sold the rights to merchandise (brokers) or transported goods from point to point
(transporters). Dun excluded banks and railroads from this its scheme (and the resulting data).
Dun also excluded personal bankruptcies of individuals such as doctors, dentists, and lawyers.
Table 1 lists the branches of business. Each row refers to a branch, indicates long and
short titles with which Dun’s Review referred to this branch, and provides additional information
from Dun’s that characterized the branch. The first row is an example. It indicates a sector,
“manufacturing;” a branch, “chemicals, drugs, and paints;” and additional information,
“medicines, fertilizers, and oils.” This example defines a branch of business including all firms
that manufactured chemicals, drugs, and paints including firms that manufactured fertilizers,
medicines, and oils. A later row in the table indicates a sector, “trading;” a branch, “liquors and
tobacco;” and additional information, “sellers of beer, wine, tobacco, and cigars.” This example
defines a branch of business including all firms that sold liquor (i.e. alcohol produced by
distillation, such as whiskey); other alcoholic beverages, such as beer and wine; and tobacco

7

products, such as cigarettes and cigars. Exclusions from this category include stores that
occasionally sold alcohol and tobacco but that primarily pursued other lines of trade, such as
general stores, pharmacies, and hotels.
The exact definitions of branches of business may matter to scholars analyzing this data.
So, we present Dun’s original descriptions in an extended excerpt below.
In the classification here give under iron are included furnaces, foundries, rolling
mills and nail works; under machinery, the manufacture of agricultural
implements; under woolens, the felt, wool hat, yarn, and shoddy works; under
cottons, the cotton hosiery and lace concerns; under lumber, the saw mills,
planning, sash and door works; under clothing millinery and tailors; under hats,
the manufacture of gloves and furs; under chemicals, medicines, fertilizers and
oils; under milling, all grinding of grain; under leather, the tanners and saddlery
and harness makers; under liquors, the manufactures of wine tobacco, cigars and
brewers; with glass and earthenware, pottery, lime and cement works. So with
traders, under liquors are included sellers of beer, wine, and cigars; with clothing,
umbrellas; with dry goods, dealers in curtains and gloves; with shoes, all rubber
goods and harness; with furniture, glassware; with hardware, cutlery and tinware;
with drugs, oils; with jewelry, watches; with books, picture dealers. Transporters
do not include railroad companies, but brokers, insurance and real estate.9
Dun’s streamlined this note in later issues, and usually published only in tables containing
quarterly tabulations. In 1900, the note indicated
Iron, Woolens and Cottons include all branches of those manufactures; Machinery
includes implements and tools; Lumber includes saw, planing, sash and door
mills, carpenters and coopers; Clothing includes millinery and furnishings; Hats
includes fur and gloves; Chemicals include drugs, fertilizers, paints and oils;
Printing and Books include engraving and maps; Milling includes baking; Leather
and Shoes includes makers of harness, saddlery, trunks, and rubber goods;
Liquors includes tobacco, wine, brewers and beer; Glass includes earthenware,
pottery, brick, lime and cement; Groceries include meats and fish; Hotels include
restaurants; Dry goods include carpets and curtains; Furniture includes crockery;
Hardware includes stoves and tools; and Jewelry includes clocks and watches.
Brokers include all real estate, note, insurance, or produce dealers whose main
business is not the handling of actual products, and Transporters includes all
except incorporated railway companies.

Dun’s summed total manufacturing failures, total trading failures, and failures of brokers and
transporters to arrive at the figure for total commercial failures. In the typical month, Dun’s
categorization embraced over three-quarters of the manufacturing and over seven-eighths of the
trading failures, both in importance and in number. Failures of the remaining firms appeared in
the categories “all other manufacturers” and “all other traders.” The exceptions were railroads
and banks, whose failures did not appear in the data.
In March 1932, Dun’s Review began to publish an additional table breaking down
business failures by economic functions. The Review titled the table “Failures by Divisions of
Industry.” Appendix 2 indicates all volumes of Dun’s Review (and its successors) containing data
disaggregated in this manner. The Review added the new table because its editors recognized
the 15 divisions of manufacturing activity listed by the Department of Commerce in the
Census of Manufactures are widely used for statistical purposes. For this reason it will
publish once each month from this time on a tabulation of failures in these groups
subdivided into Manufacturing, Trading and Other Commercial.10
Dun’s divisions of industry mirrored those used by the Census of Manufactures with a few
modifications. Under lines of trade, the classification “books and periodicals” replaced “printing
and publishing,” which described a line of manufacturing. Classifications were added for
“hotels” and “general stores”, since those could be readily distinguished from other lines of
trade. The “other commercial” classification was retained for firms which operated neither as
manufacturers or retailers, such as commission merchants, manufacturers’ agents, brokers, and
others similarly engaged.
At the aggregate level, ‘branches of business’ and ‘divisions of industry’ appeared
identical. Both schemes divided firms into the sectors ‘manufacturing,’ ‘trading,’ and ‘brokers.’
For these sectors, the number of firms and failures was identical. Differences existed, however,
10

Dun’s Review, 19 March 1932, p. 3.

9

in the details. The scheme ‘branches of business’ arose about 1890 and characterized the nature
of commerce and industry at that time. Rules for categorizing firms remained constant, which
ensured a consistent categorization of firms and the comparability of data over time. The scheme
‘division of industry’ arose during the twentieth century, from the Census Bureau’s efforts to
improve data on America’s evolving economy. The Census Bureau standardized all data
according to this classification scheme, and periodically updated its rules regarding
classification, to reflect the changing nature of manufacturing and trade.
The scheme for classifying firms by division of industry evolved gradually after its
introduction. In August 1932, Dun’s Review split several categories, which increased the number
of divisions in manufacturing and trading. In addition, Dun’s divided traders into wholesalers
and retailers. In September 1932, the Review further disaggregated the divisions of industry. In
October 1932, the Review provided “a more comprehensive tabulation … of the failures known
as ‘Other Commercial,’ those which cannot be properly classed with wither manufacturing or
trading divisions.”11 In April 1933 and February 1934, the Review again updated its classification
schemes. In February 1936, the table’s format changed another time, and the Review described
the changes in this manner.
In the attempt to make the failure records more useful, certain changes in the
tabulations appear for the first time this month. The records in the past have
included failures of insurance and real estate agents and brokers. Some are
undoubtedly instances where the failure was in fact that of an apartment house or
office building owner or operator. The real estate involved in such cases led to
extremely large liabilities. Furthermore, it has not been possible to maintain as
complete and consistent coverage or to gather as complete information for these
occupations as for the lines of industry and trade ordinarily surveyed by the Dun
& Bradstreet organization. The revision has therefore limited the tabulation more
strictly to commercial failures, covering manufacturing, wholesale trade, retail
trade, construction and commercial service such as laundries, dry cleaning, and
hotels. The records in the past do not include so-called personal bankruptcies or
bankruptcies of persons such as doctors, dentists, and lawyers. It is hoped to
11

Dun’s Review, 22 October 1932, p. 15

10

include a revision of monthly data back at least to 1920 in the March issue of the
Dun & Bradstreet Review.
A new subdivision has been added covering the construction industry.
This does not imply any change in the total coverage, for these failures were
previously included in other groups. Because of the fact that failures in the
construction industry often include individuals whose activity in construction was
inextricably entangled with real estate financing and speculative building, they
frequently report unusually large liabilities. It is believed that their segregation
into a separate group will make the tabulation more useful and significant than in
the past.12
The firms now classified under construction consisted of enterprises previously included in other
groups, mainly manufacturing.13 Tables 2, 3, and 4 depict ‘divisions of industry’ after these
revisions and as they existed in the year 1936.14
Along with data disaggregated by division of industry, Dun’s Review continued to
publish data on failures by branches of business. The editorial staff believed that businessmen
wished to see this series continue, so that they could compare contemporary to past events, and
so that they could discern changes in patterns without worrying whether these occurred because
of changes in the construction of the data. Dun’s Review continued to publish data by branches
of business after merging with its rival, Bradstreet, in 1933. Dun and Bradstreet published both
series for four years.15 In March 1936, however, the company discontinued ‘branches by
business,’ stating that ‘divisions of industry’ better reflected the structure of the economy at that
time and coincided with the way in which the Bureau of the Census and Department of
Commerce categorized information about production and trade, making it the more useful series.
In 1935, Dun and Bradstreet began to publish data on a new method of corporate
reorganization akin to bankruptcy: petitions under Section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act of 1934.

15
In the months following the merger with Bradstreet and the restructuring of the Review, Dun’s occasionally
labeled the table “Divisions of Industry” as “Branches of Business” or “Branches of Industry” and vice versa. Dun’s
also occasionally published one, rather than both, of these tables, although Dun’s filled the resulting gap in the series
by printing additional data when it resumed publishing the tables in future issues.
13

11

Section 77B provided for the reorganization of corporations. Dun and Bradstreet began
collecting data on petitions under Section 77B soon after the legislation became law. Dun and
Bradstreet began publishing the data one year later. Appendix 3 indicates all issues of Dun’s
Review (and related publications) containing data about reorganizations under Section 77B.
The quality of Dun’s data on bankruptcies was widely recognized. Dun’s data appeared
in the Survey of Current Business, The Statistical Abstract of the United States, and the monthly
reviews and annual reports of the Federal Reserve banks and board. Dun’s data formed the basis
of articles published in newspapers such as the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and
Commercial and Financial Chronicle. Dun’s Review noted the popularity of its data when the
editors wrote that “not only trade and manufacturing organizations recognize the importance of
the records regarding their especial lines, but annual books of reference, almanacs, and even the
monthly report of the Bureau of Statistics publishes the figures under the direction of the
Treasury Department at Washington.”16 The fact that both businessmen and bureaucrats used
Dun’s data indicates that they found it valuable. Dun’s data on business failures was certainly
watched by everyone interested in economic trends from the 1890s through the 1930s.

3. Methods for Reconstructing Dun’s Data Series
Dun’s data on business failures does not come in an easily accessible format. Dun
published the data in a table that appeared each month. The table typically contained data for
failures during the preceding month, the month before that, and the same month in the preceding
year. The table that appeared in March 1910, for example, contained data for February 1910,
January 1910, and February 1909. Every three months, Dun published a table summarizing the
results for the previous quarter, and typically provided data for each quarter in the preceding year
16

Dun’s Review, 13 July 1901, p. 6.

12

and from the same quarter in the preceding five years. These quarterly tables typically appeared
in April, July, and September. In January, instead of publishing a quarterly table, Dun published
a table summarizing the previous year and providing comparisons to the past several years. This
schedule remained consistent for roughly forty years.
To print the tables, R. G. Dun used a linotype system that ensured the information in
subsequent volumes matched the information in earlier issues. The Linotype machine operator
entered text on a 90-character keyboard. The Linotype typesetting machine dropped metal molds
for the corresponding letters and numbers into a matrix, which was then cast to form an entire
line of text, or in our case, a line of a table, as a single metal slug. A template held the slugs for
the table together. Each month, a printer cast a new line for the table, fit the new slug into the
template, shifted all of the current slugs forward by one line, and removed the oldest slug from
the table. Later tables, in other words, literally replicated portions of older tables. This method
ensured that Dun’s published consistent data, although consistency posed one potential problem.
Typos or transpositions that appeared in a table often reappeared in subsequent tables cast with
the same slugs.
The structure of Dun’s tables shaped the way in which we reconstructed the data series.
The reconstruction required an algorithm that accomplished several tasks. The first was
gathering data scattered throughout hundreds of issues. The second was filling in observations
missing for a variety of reasons. The third was checking for typos and transpositions generated
by the typesetting process and correcting those errors. The fourth was distinguishing information
released initially from data in its final revised form.
Step (1) involved gathering the data. We did this by requesting all volumes of Dun’s
Review and its successor publications for the years 1890 to 1941 from the libraries of the

13

University of California. Each bound volume contained all of the weekly issues published in a
particular year. If volumes were missing, damaged, or incomplete, we requested replacements
through interlibrary loan. We combed through these volumes to find tables containing data on
business failures. We copied all of those tables and created a web site containing all of the
documentary evidence. Several lacunae existed in the evidence. Sporadically, Dun’s Review did
not contain the regular table on failures by branch of business. On a few occasions, the
universities from which we gathered Dun’s Review appear to have misplaced a relevant issue,
and interlibrary loan was unable to find a circulating copy.
Step (2) involved filling in missing observations. We document all of these lapses and the
way in which we corrected them in Table 5. Most of these problems could be corrected by
looking up the information in the appropriate table in subsequent volumes. This procedure
worked for all observations except those for September, October, and December 1933. For these
months, Dun’s Review never published data on failures by branches of business (although Dun’s
did publish those values for the entire U.S., for the sum of all manufacturing branches, and for
the sum of all trading branches). For September, we extracted the missing information from
quarterly figures, by subtracting data for July and August 1933 from data for the third quarter of
1933.
For October and December, we extracted the sum (October 1933 plus December 1933)
by subtracting the total for the other ten months from the annual total. We split the sum
(Oct+Dec) into monthly components for each branch of business using the following formulas.
(1.a) Mi,Oct = Mi, Oct+Dec * MOct/(MOct + MDec)
(1.b) Mi, Dec = Mi, Oct+Dec * MDec/( MOct + MDec)
(1.c) Tj, Oct = Tj, Oct+Dec * TOct/( TOct + TDec)

14

(1.d) Tj, Dec = Tj, Oct+Dec * TDec/( TOct + TDec)
The variables on the left-hand side of these equations are unobserved. Mi,Oct indicates the
October value for the ith manufacturing branch. Mi,Dec indicates the December value for the ith
manufacturing branch. Ti,Oct indicates the October value for the jth trading branch. Ti,Dec
indicates the October value for the jth trading branch. The variables on the right-hand sides of
these equations are observed. Mi, Oct+Dec indicates the sum of October and December for the ith
manufacturing branch. MOct indicates the October value for the sum of all manufacturing
branches. MDec indicates the December value for the sum of all manufacturing branches. Ti,
Oct+Dec

indicates the sum of October and December for the ith trading branch. TOct indicates the

October value for the sum of all trading branches. TDec indicates the December value for the sum
of all trading branches.
We round the results of equations (1) to (4) to the nearest whole number. To this
rounding rule, we make a few exceptions, which ensure that the results yield the appropriate sum
for each month and each branch of business. We round up some remainders under 0.5, if that
action yields the correct total. In such cases, we round up the highest remainder under 0.5 that
yields the correct total. We round down some remainders over 0.5, if that action yields the
correct total. In such cases, we always round down the lowest remainder over 0.5 that yields the
correct total.
Step (3) involved checking the data for typos and transpositions generated by the
typesetting process. We did this by summing disaggregated data and seeing if our sum equaled
the totals reported in the original sources. In the few cases where the books did not balance, we
examined all later instances in which Dun’s published that data, to see if they caught and
corrected the discrepancy. If they did not, we checked to see if the discrepancy arose from

15

common errors such as mistaking a 3 for an 8 or dropping a zero from the end of a number. We
corrected all errors whose cause seemed clear. We left other minor discrepancies in the data. We
indicate all of our actions in the notes to the tables and the appendices to this essay.
Step (4) involves comparing the initially released data to the data in its final revised form.
The initial series represents the information available to agents at the time they make decisions.
We refer to this series as “initial data” or “initial reports.” The final series indicates the actual
state of the economy. We refer to this series the “final data,” “final reports,” or “final data
series.” The former and the latter often differ. Statistical agencies, such as R. G. Dun and
Company, released data about the economy, such as failures by branch of business, on a regular
schedule. Sometimes on the day of release, they lacked accurate or complete information. After
the initial release, they updated reports, corrected errors, incorporated additional information,
and revised previous estimates.17
To create the final data series, we begin with the latest book published by Dun and
Bradstreets, and then enter data on bankruptcies going backwards in time. Reverse chronological
order ensures that we enter Dun’s latest data. To create the initial data series, we begin with the
earliest issue containing information about business failures. We enter data for a particular month
the first time it appears, and do not update the entry if Dun and Bradstreet’s subsequently revises
the figure.
These procedures provide two series. The initial series shows what people knew at the
time they made decisions. The final series shows what actually happened. For failures by
branches of business, the two series are extremely similar. The initial series, in other words,
contained few errors. So, we report only the final series. For failures by division of industry,

17

Orphanides et. al (2000) and Orphanides (2001) emphasize the difference between initial and final data. Park and
Richardson (2010) illustrate the sizeable gaps between initial and final data series created in the early 20th century.

16

however, the initial and final series differ dramatically, particularly during the years before 1936.
These large errors arose because Dun’s repeatedly changed the way in which it classified firms
and the way in which it divided firms amongst industries. In this case, what people knew may
have differed from what actually occurred. Since these differences may have mattered, we plan
to disseminate both series.
Our reconstruction efforts resulted in the following series. One is number of failures by
sector, 1895 to 1940. For the years before 1936, data for the three sectors – manufacturers,
traders, other – comes from branches of business. For the years 1936 to 1940, data for the
manufactures equals manufacturers in divisions of industry. Data for traders is the sum of
wholesale traders and retail traders for divisions of industry. Data for other is the sum of
construction and commercial services from divisions of industry. This series appears at the end
of our paper in Table 6. Two is liabilities of failures by sector, 1895 to 1940. The sources are the
same as for the previous series. This series appears in our paper as Table 7.
Series three through six contain data about branches of business. Three is number of
failed manufacturing firms by branch of manufacturing, 1895 to 1935. This series appears as
Table 8. Four is liabilities of failed manufacturing firms by branch of manufacturing, 1895 to
1935. This series appears as an online appendix to the version of this paper posted at the National
Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) web site. Its dimensions prevented us from including it
in a published version of this essay. Five is number of failed trading firms by branch of trading,
1895 to 1935. This series appears as an online appendix at the NBER. Six is liabilities of failed
trading firms by branch of trading, 1895 to 1935. This series appears as an online appendix at the
NBER.

17

Series seven through sixteen contain information about failures by divisions of industry.
All of these series extend from January 1936 through December 1940. Series seven indicates the
number of failed manufacturing firms by divisions of manufacturing. It appears in our essay as
Table 9. Eight indicates liabilities of failed manufacturing firms by divisions of manufacturing. It
appears as an online appendix at the NBER. Nine indicates the number of failed wholesale firms
by divisions of wholesalers. It appears in our essay as Table 10. Ten indicates liabilities of failed
wholesale firms by divisions of wholesalers. It appears as an online appendix at the NBER.
Eleven indicates the number of failed retailers by divisions of retailers. It appears in our essay as
Table 11. Twelve indicates liabilities of failed retailers by divisions of retailers. It appears as an
online appendix at the NBER. Thirteen indicates the number of failed construction firms by
divisions of construction. It appears in our essay as Table 12. Fourteen indicates liabilities of
failed construction firms by divisions of construction. It appears as an online appendix at the
NBER. Fifteen indicates the number of failed commercial service firms by divisions of
commercial services. It appears in our essay as Table 13. Sixteen indicates liabilities of failed
commercial service firms by divisions of commercial service. It appears as an online appendix at
the NBER.
Series seventeen and eighteen refer to Section 77b. Seventeen indicates the number of
firms that applied for 77b status by sector from August 1935 to December 1938. It appears in our
essay as Table 14. Eighteen indicates liabilities of firms that applied for 77b status by sector
from August 1935 to December 1938. It appears as an online appendix at the NBER. Data for
Section 77b appears by sector, and not by division of industry, because Dun and Bradstreet’s did
not disaggregate the information at that level.

4. What Does the Data Reveal?
In this section, we discuss patterns apparent in the data. We do this by plotting raw data
and exploratory series. The exploratory series are transformations of the raw data that remove
differences in scales and outliers, making it easier to compare the changes in level and trend in
difference branches of business.
Figure (1) plots the number of failures by month in each sector (i.e. manufacturing,
trading, and other) as well as the total (i.e. sum of three sectors). All of the series exhibit an
upward trend, caused by the growth in the number of firms. The number of failures in
manufacturing and trading appear to be increasing at a similar rate. The number of failures
among brokers and traders (i.e. other) appears to be rising at a rate higher than other sectors. The
reason appears to be a growth in the number of middlemen, which results in the growth in the
number of failed middlemen, even though the rate at which middlemen fail remains constant.
Each series fluctuate around its upward trend. Failures peak during downturns,
particularly the contractions in 1896, 1907, 1914, and the early 1930s. These contractions, as
well as the remaining recessions determined by the NBER, are highlighted by grey vertical
bands. In several instances, failures peak after the trough of a contraction and at the beginning of
the recovery. An example is the end of 1914, when failures in all sectors peak following the
outbreak of hostilities in Europe, which disrupted international financial and trading
relationships.
World War One seems to have had a salutary effect on the survival rate of firms. After
the start of hostilities, failures fell in all sectors. Failures fell throughout the war. Failures
continued to fall for a few years following the armistice. Failures may have declined because
military expansion and international embargoes increased demand for domestic goods and

19

services. Wartime rationing and industrial planning may also have had an effect. The War
Industries Board allocated raw materials, labor, and purchases across existing firms. The Board
may have acted to ensure that all firms received ample opportunities for profit.
During the recession of the early 1920s, failure rates more rapidly than at any other time.
The increase illustrates the severity of the contraction. Failures peaked at a hitherto unheard of
level. The peak occurred during the early months of the contraction, raising the question of
whether failures were a leading or lagging indicator of business cycles. After the peak, failures
remained at a plateau higher than before the World War.
During the contraction from 1929 to 1933, failures increased to new heights. Failures
peaked during 1932 and were falling as the financial system collapsed at the beginning of 1933.
During the recover, failures fell quickly. Failures remained at a low level throughout the
recovery. Failures increased during the contraction of 1937. The increase was milder than at the
beginning of the decade or in early 1933.
Figure (2) plots the total number of failures by month for each sector relative to the
average number of failures that occurred during each month from 1895 through 1910.
Specifically, this series is
( 2)

~
N s , t  N s , t N s , t 1911

~
Here, N s ,t is the series that we plot. The letter s indicates sector. The letter t indicates month. Ns,t

indicates the number of failures in sector s in month t. N s ,t 1911 indicates the average for sector s
for all months before 1911 (i.e. 1895 to 1910). These graphs ease comparisons across sectors, by
plotting data for each sector on a scale running from 0 to 6. The scale indicates failures in that
month relative to average failures from 1895 to 1910, a period when the total number of failures

20

remained stable. The figure highlights the rapid growth in failures of brokers and traders, relative
to manufacturing and trading.
Figures (3) and (4) plot the total number of failures by month for each branch of business
relative to the average number of failures that occurred during each month from 1895 through
1910. Specifically, this series is
(3)

~
N b , t  N b , t N b , t 1911

~
Here, N b,t is the series that we plot. The letter b indicates the branch of business. Nb,t indicates the

number of failures in sector s in month t. Nb,t 1911 indicates the average for branch b for all
months before 1911 (i.e. 1895 to 1910). Figure (3) focuses on manufacturers. In panel of the
figures portrays failures for an individual branch of business. Patterns differ among branches. In
some industries, such as hats and glass, failures appear to have been more volatile than in other
industries, such as printing and leather. In basic industries that supplied intermediate inputs for
other manufacturers – such as machinery, iron, and lumber – failures displayed little volatility,
except during the contractions of the 1930s, when these firms at the bottom of the industrial food
chain suffered disproportionate losses.
Particular months deserve extra attention. In December 1927 and May 1932, the hat
manufactures experienced a large number of failures relative to the average (resulting in outliers
of 8.3 and 8.5, respectively). In October 1933, the chemical manufactures experienced a large
number of failures relative to the average (resulting in an outlier of 9.5). These outliers appear as
a dot on the top border of the figure.
Figure (4) focuses on branches of business among trading firms. As with manufacturers,
patterns differ among branches. Failures appear to have fluctuated substantially in branches that
sold durable and luxury goods, such as clothing, jewelry, and hats. Failures appear to have been

21

stable in branches that distributed foodstuffs and other necessities, such as groceries and general
stores. The trend among liquor shops illustrates the effects of Prohibition. Failures increased
when the amendment prohibiting alcohol passed. Failures dropped near to zero thereafter,
because far fewer firms operated in this branch of business, and those that remained operated
illegally and did not report their activities. Particular months deserve extra attention. In May
1932, the clothing traders experience a large number of failures relative to the average (resulting
in an outlier for 9.5). This outlier appears as a dot on the top border of the figure.
Figure (5) plots total liabilities of failed firms by month for each sector. Liabilities of
failed firms fluctuated in sync with numbers of failed firms. But, differences exist between the
series, particular the height and timing of peaks. For manufacturing firms for example, liabilities
peaked during the contraction in the mid 1920s, while numbers peaked during the late 1920s. For
trading firms, liabilities biggest increase came in the summer of 1914, when the onset of
hostilities interrupted transatlantic trade and finance. Particular months deserve extra attention.
In March 1921, April 1922, and December 1930, the Brokers and Traders sector experienced
large amounts of liabilities of failed businesses relative to the average (resulting in outliers of
15.1, 16.1, and 21, respectively). These outliers appear as a dot on the top border of the figure.
Figure (6) plots the total liabilities of failed firms by month for each sector relative to the
average number of failures that occurred during each month from 1895 through 1910.
Specifically, this series is

Here, N b,t is the series that we plot. The letter b indicates the branch of business. Nb,t indicates the

number of failures in sector s in month t. Nb,t 1911 indicates the average for branch b for all
months before 1911 (i.e. 1895 to 1910). Figure (7) focuses on manufacturers. Liabilities varied
most in branches providing intermediate inputs for other industries, such as iron and machinery,
and in branches making durable luxuries, such as hats and glass. Figure (8) focuses on traders. In
branches that traded durables and luxuries, such as books, clothing, furniture, and jewelry,
liabilities of failed firms clearly peaked during the contraction from 1929 to 1933. At that time,
failures also peaked for hotels and other firms catering towards tourists. In industries trading in
perishables and foodstuffs, such as grocers and general stores, the Great Contraction did less
harm to businesses.
Particular months deserve extra attention. In April 1897 and November 1921, the cotton
manufactures experience a large number of liabilities of failed businesses relative to the average
(resulting in outliers of 42 and 43, respectively). In December 1927, the glass manufactures
experienced a large number of liabilities of failed businesses relative to the average (resulting in
an outlier of 31). In July 1924 and October 1924, the hat manufactures experienced a large
number of liabilities of failed businesses relative to the average (resulting in outliers of 37 and
43, respectively). In January 1915 and January 1931, the machinery manufactures experienced a
large number of liabilities of failed businesses, relative to the average (resulting in outliers of 31
and 47, respectively). In October 1908, the milling manufactures experience a large number of

23

liabilities of failed businesses relative to the average (resulting in an outlier of 48). In October
1923, the printing manufactures experience a large number of liabilities of failed businesses
relative to the average (resulting in an outlier of 64). These outliers appear as a dot on the top
border of the figure.
The chemical manufactures deserve extra attention. The liabilities of failed businesses for
chemical manufactures tend to be greater across the entire time period. While most branches of
business observe a small amount of outliers, the chemical manufactures observe 9 outliers across
the time periods. In December 1920, April 1922, May 1923, March 1924, December 1927,
February 1928, February 1932, July 1932, and February 1933, the chemical manufactures
experienced a large number of liabilities of failed businesses relative to the average (resulting in
outliers of 42, 50, 26, 681, 26, 32, 43, 48, and 43, respectively). These outliers appear as a dot on
the top border of the figure.
For traders, particular months deserve extra attention. In June 1914, the dry goods traders
experience a large number of liabilities of failed businesses relative to the average (resulting in
an outlier of 59). In December 1923, the furniture traders experience a large number of liabilities
of failed business, relative to the average (resulting in an outlier of 30). In July 1920 and
February 1921, the hats traders experience a large number of liabilities of failed businesses
relative to the average (resulting in outliers of 52 and 43, respectively). In May 1915, January
1932, and April 1933, the chemical traders experienced a large number of liabilities of failed
businesses, relative to the average (resulting in outliers of 31, 38, and 68, respectively). In
January 1929, the paints traders experienced a large number of liabilities of failed businesses
relative to the average (resulting in an outlier of 35).

The remaining figures focus on the average size of failed firms. Figure (9) plots the
average size of failures by month for each sector. Size is defined as total liabilities of failed firms
divided by the total number of failed firms. Specifically, size S for sector (or branch) i in month t
equals:

Figures (11) and (12) plot the average size of failures by month for each branch of business
relative to the average size in that branch from 1895 through 1910. Figure (11) focuses on
manufacturing. Figure (12) focuses on trading.
Particular months deserve extra attention. In October 1916, March 1927, February 1931,
and July 1932, the cotton manufactures experienced an increase in the average size of failures
relative to the average (resulting in outliers of 22.6, 21, 29, and 29, respectively). In February
1913, the iron manufactures experienced an increase in the average size of failures relative to the
average (resulting in an average of 26.3). In January 1931, the machinery manufactures
experienced an increase in the average size of failures relative to the average (resulting in an
outlier of 20.4). In August 1908, the milling manufactures experienced an increase in the average
size of failures relative to the average (resulting in an outlier of 35). In October 1923, the
printing manufactures experienced an increase in the average size of failures relative to the
average (resulting in an outlier of 50). In August 1928, the wool manufactures experienced an
increase in the average size of failures relative to the average (resulting in an outlier of 27). In
March 1903, the chemical manufactures experienced an increase in the average size of failures

25

relative to the average (resulting in an outlier of 299). These outliers appear as a dot on the top
border of the figure.
In trading branches, certain months deserve extra attention. In June 1906, the dry goods
traders experienced an increase in the average size of failures relative to the average (resulting in
an outlier of 37). In December 1923, the furniture traders experienced an increase in the average
size of failures relative to the average (resulting in an outlier of 25). In September 1935, the
jewelry traders experienced an increase in the average size of failures relative to the average
(resulting in an outlier of 15.9). In January 1901, the paint traders experienced an increase in the
average size of failures relative to the average (resulting in an outlier of 70).

Section 5: Discussion
Business failures are important indicators of economic activity. Failures increase during
contractions and decrease during expansions. Businessmen understood these patterns centuries
ago. Their desire for information about general trends provided a market for information
agencies, such as R. G. Dun and Company and its successor, Dun and Bradstreet’s, which
gathered data on business failures from courthouses throughout the United States. This essay
reconstructs those series making them accessible at the level of month, branch of business, and
division of industry.
This essay does not report data on failures aggregated geographically. Such data exists in
several sources. Beginning about 1894, Dun’s Review published quarterly data on failures at the
state level. After 1924, this data appeared in the Statistical Abstract of the United States
aggregated annually. About 1916, the Federal Reserve Bulletin began publishing Dun’s failure
data aggregated at the Federal Reserve district level. In 1894, Dun and Bradstreet’s begin to

26

report data aggregated by state and sector. The authors are currently collecting and cleaning
these series.
Scholars may be interested in calculating rates of failure, which compare the number of
failures to the number of active firms. Beginning in 1925, data on the number of firms in
operation each year appears in the Statistical Abstract of the United States. Tables take the series
back to 1857. Identical information appears in the Historical Statistics of the United States. The
authors know of no data on the number of active firms reported by month, state, or sector.
Creating such series probably requires research in Dun and Bradstreet’s archives, as in Kim
(2003).
Scholars may be interested in adjusting the liabilities of failed firms to account for
inflation and deflation, both of which occurred in the era under consideration. This exercise
raises puzzling issues. When deflating consumption and income, scholars typically employ price
indices constructed from baskets of goods comparable to the nominal series of interest. In the
case of liabilities of failed firms, the relevant price index is not obvious. Scholars might use
indices that represent the consumption habits of creditors of firms that fail. Most of these
individuals inhabited the upper decile (and higher) of the income distribution. Scholars might
also use a series related to the industry under consideration. This seems sensible for industries,
like grocers, whose assets consisted largely of inventories for which retail and wholesale price
series exist. In other industries, like steel manufacturing, where assets consisted largely plant and
equipment, using the prices of variable inputs and outputs seems unappealing, although no better
alternative leaps to mind.
Even though no obvious optimal method for deflating liabilities exists, the series
introduced in this essay should have many uses for scholars interested in economic history. For

27

example, the data may shed light on the connection between credit and economic activity. Banks
supply credit. Businesses require credit. Firms needs vary across industries. Data now exists
about all of these factors, allowing scholars to study links between contractions in banking and
industry. The data introduced in this essay also raise issues concerning the natures of recessions
in the first half of the twentieth century. The most severe contraction, of course, began in 1929
and continued through the 1930s. The contraction at the beginning of the 1920s appears,
however, to have forced more firms more rapidly out of business. Why did this happen? Did the
differences stem from government policies, the structure of the economy, or factors yet to be
considered? By collecting and disseminating data, the authors hope to help scholars answer such
questions.
